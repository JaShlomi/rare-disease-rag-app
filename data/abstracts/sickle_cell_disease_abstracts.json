    "title": "Real-World Experience of L-Glutamine in Sickle Cell Disease: A Retrospective Observational Study.",
    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) affects millions globally, with approximately 0.26% of the Saudi population impacted. Despite standard treatments, patients frequently experience vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs). This retrospective observational study evaluated the real-world effectiveness of L-glutamine (Endari<sup>®</sup>) in reducing SCD-related complications in the Saudi population, where data remain limited. Patients aged five and older who received L-glutamine from June 2019 to June 2023 were included. The primary endpoint was VOC frequency through week 48. Descriptive statistics and paired t-tests compared outcomes before and after treatment. Fifteen patients (median age 12 years, 53% female) met the inclusion criteria; all were on maximum tolerated hydroxyurea. Eleven completed 48 weeks, showing a median VOC reduction from 4 to 3 (<i>p</i> = 0.44). Hospital stay duration remained unchanged (median 7 days, <i>p</i> = 0.72). Laboratory parameters were largely stable, except for a 61.9% increase in reticulocyte count (<i>p</i> = 0.03). The estimated annual treatment cost exceeded SAR 2 million (USD ~547,840). L-glutamine did not produce statistically significant improvements in VOC frequency, though numerical trends were observed. Given the small sample size and limited statistical power, the findings are exploratory. Larger, well-powered, multicenter studies are needed to confirm L-glutamine's potential benefits in this population."

    "title": "Assessment of the Hearing Threshold and Pattern of Tympanograms of Sickle Cell Disease Patients in Calabar, Nigeria.",
    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease patients often have high level of hearing threshold due to their susceptibility to pneumococcal infections, otitis media, and vaso-occlusive injury to the cochlea. This study aimed to determine the associations between the hemoglobin variants and hearing thresholds, hearing loss (HL), and tympanometry distributions in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). This hospital-based study was conducted between September 2019 and September 2021. We recruited 110 confirmed SS and SC patients from adult and pediatric sickle cell clinics, Calabar sickle cell clubs, and 110 healthy controls (AA and AS). Structured questionnaires were used to interview the study population, and all of them underwent ear, nose, and throat examinations, tympanometry, and pure tone audiometry for those aged >5 years after obtaining informed consent and medical ethics committee approval. Data were analyzed using international business machine (IBM) corporation statistical product and service solution (SPSS) version 25 software. Descriptive analysis was performed using tables, graphs, and charts, whereas inferential statistics were obtained using the Chi-square test of independence or Fisher's exact test, t-test, or analysis of variance (ANOVA). Statistical significance was set at P value < 0.05. The median ages of the SCD patients and their controls were 18 and 23 years, respectively. SCD patients have higher hearing thresholds, with 8.9% conductive loss, 4.5% unilateral mild mixed hearing loss, and 3.3% sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) (2.0% among the controls; P value of 0.669), and more commonly in the right ear. The overall HL prevalence was 16.7% SCD patients and 8.0% controls (double; P value of 0.067). SNHL is mostly mild and unilateral in nature and affects only adults. Type B tympanogram was only reported in children with SCD. HbSS was the most prevalent genotype, with greater (double) HL than controls, affecting the right ear of males. HL patterns included mild conductive HL, mixed HL, and SNHL. SCD could be a risk factor for OME."

    "title": "A Mixed Methods Study to Understand the Role of Knowledge in Transition among Youth with Sickle Cell Disease.",
    "abstract": "Disease and management knowledge is crucial for individuals with sickle cell disease (SCD) transitioning from a pediatric to adult healthcare facility. However, there is a lack of understanding regarding the specific education needed and its association with an individual's ability to successfully transition. This study aims to explore the association between SCD-specific transition readiness assessment scores, patient characteristics, and the perceived importance and confidence in the individual's ability to manage their health and transition to an adult doctor. Semi-structured interviews provided insights on education gaps and preferences. Eighty-four individuals completed the transition readiness assessment. Younger patients (≤18 years) had significantly lower scores on the appointment (1.1 (sd=0.7) vs 1.6 (sd=0.6), p = 0.007) and insurance (0.5 (sd=0.7) vs 1.5 (sd=1.1), p = 0.0006) domains as compared to older (>18 years) individuals. Those very confident in the ability to manage their healthcare scored significantly higher in disease knowledge (2.4 (sd=0.5) vs 2.0 (sd=0.7), p-value = 0.01), medication management (2.5 (sd=0.6) vs 2.1 (sd=0.4), p = 0.0001), appointments (1.4 (sd=0.7) vs 0.9 (sd=0.5), p-value = 0.0006), and insurance (0.9 (sd=0.9) vs 0.5 (sd=0.8), p-value = 0.02) than those who were not. Semi-structured interviews with nine young adults revealed a preference for transition education to start in their mid-teens, at least twice a year, and using a combination of approaches. Additional themes identified included the desire for ongoing education, familiarity with the workflow and environment, access to care, and the importance of support systems during their transition."

    "title": "DeepSPV: A deep learning pipeline for 3D spleen volume estimation from 2D ultrasound images.",
    "abstract": "Splenomegaly, the enlargement of the spleen, is an important clinical indicator for various associated medical conditions, such as sickle cell disease (SCD). Spleen length measured from 2D ultrasound is the most widely used metric for characterising spleen size. However, it is still considered a surrogate measure, and spleen volume remains the gold standard for assessing spleen size. Accurate spleen volume measurement typically requires 3D imaging modalities, such as computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, but these are not widely available, especially in the Global South which has a high prevalence of SCD. In this work, we introduce a deep learning pipeline, DeepSPV, for precise spleen volume estimation from single or dual 2D ultrasound images. The pipeline involves a segmentation network and a variational autoencoder for learning low-dimensional representations from the estimated segmentations. We investigate three approaches for spleen volume estimation and our best model achieves 86.62%/92.5% mean relative volume accuracy (MRVA) under single-view/dual-view settings, surpassing the performance of human experts. In addition, the pipeline can provide confidence intervals for the volume estimates as well as offering benefits in terms of interpretability, which further support clinicians in decision-making when identifying splenomegaly. We evaluate the full pipeline using a highly realistic synthetic dataset generated by a diffusion model, achieving an overall MRVA of 83.0% from a single 2D ultrasound image. Our proposed DeepSPV is the first work to use deep learning to estimate 3D spleen volume from 2D ultrasound images and can be seamlessly integrated into the current clinical workflow for spleen assessment. We also make our synthetic spleen ultrasound dataset publicly available."

    "abstract": "The greatest burden of sickle cell disease (SCD) globally occurs in sub-Saharan Africa, where significant morbidity occurs secondary to SCD-induced vasculopathy and stroke. Transcranial doppler (TCD) ultrasound grades the severity of vasculopathy, with disease modifying therapy resulting in stroke risk reduction in high-risk children. The feasibility and utility of TCD screening in young children with SCD remains understudied. We performed a retrospective review of TCD examination results in children ≤24 months with SCD in one of six centers in Africa. Using the time-averaged maximum of the mean flow velocity, values <170 cm/s were considered to be low risk for stroke, 171-199 cm/s conditional risk, and >200 cm/s high risk. A total of 115 children were screened, with five (4.3%) unable to complete the TCD due to agitation. A total of 110 children with a mean age of 15 ± 5 months were included. Low risk studies were identified in 95 (86.4%) and conditional risk in 15 (13.6%). No patient had a high risk study. Those with conditional risk examinations were not more anemic than those with low risk studies (p = 0.84). TCD screening of young children with SCD is feasible, with low technical failure rates. Many children in our cohort had a conditional risk study, suggesting cerebral vasculopathy begins at a young age in some African children. Future large cohort studies should be undertaken to determine the incidence of conditional or high risk studies in African children ≤2 years with SCD to inform future guideline development for TCD screening."

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most common genetic disorder in the United States, affecting approximately 300,000 infants worldwide annually. As advancements in treatment have led to increased life expectancy for individuals with SCD, this population may be considered for anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) due to potentially accelerated degenerative disc disease. The current study sought to characterize 90-day postoperative outcomes among SCD patients undergoing ACDF using matched cohorts. Adult patients undergoing single-level ACDF were identified from the 2010 to 2021 Q1 M151 PearlDiver database. Those with SCD were matched 1:4 to controls based on age, sex, and Elixhauser Comorbidity Index (ECI). The occurrence of 90-day postoperative adverse events, readmissions, and emergency department (ED) visits were assessed. Patient characteristics and postoperative outcomes were compared using Student's t-tests and chi-square tests. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to compare outcomes between the matched cohorts. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. After matching, 82 SCD patients and 324 controls were identified. Patients with SCD had significantly higher odds of adverse events including: any 90-day adverse events (OR 3.06), serious adverse events (OR 2.91), minor adverse events (OR 3.62), readmissions (OR 3.50), and ED visits (OR 3.64) (p < 0.05 for all). In terms of individual adverse events, in decreasing OR order patients with SCD had higher odds of: pneumonia (OR 10.41), acute kidney injury (OR 6.65), deep vein thrombosis (OR 6.73), sepsis (OR 5.30), urinary tract infections (OR 3.43) (p < 0.05 for all). SCD patients undergoing single-level ACDF were found to have significantly higher odds of multiple postoperative complications compared to matched controls. These findings suggest that SCD patients may require more intensive perioperative care and monitoring to minimize such adverse outcomes. Further research is needed to optimize management strategies for this high-risk population."

    "title": "Oral Health Status of People with Sickle Cell Disease at a Major Hospital in Cameroon.",
    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease is a neglected inherited condition that affects the hemoglobin in red blood cells and impacts at least 2% of the West African population. This hemoglobinopathy presents with high mobility and mortality as a result of infections and vaso-occlusive pain crises as a result of structural abnormality of the red blood, making it fragile and rigid. The objective of our study was to describe the oral health status of sickle cell patients in Yaoundé Central Hospital, Cameroon. A descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out in the hematology unit of the Yaoundé Central Hospital from June to October 2022. A total of 63 patients, made up of 41 (65%) males and 22 (35%) females, were recruited in the study. The majority, 60 (95%), consumed sugary foods, while 43 (68%) brushed their teeth before meals, and 27 (43%) brushed their teeth once a day. A third, 24 (38%), presented with pallor of the palatal mucosa, and 24 (74.6%) had dental caries. The mean decayed, missing, and filled teeth index of this population was 2.6 (moderate) and 11 (17.5%) periodontitis. Less than a third, 17 (26.9%) of the patients had been to a dentist, 26 (41.3%) did not see it necessary to consult a dentist, while 23 (37%) thought that oral conditions are not serious. Two-thirds, 38 (60.5%), did not receive any treatment for caries. Tooth extraction 18 (27.9%) was the most common treatment given, 5 (7%) conservative treatment, and no treatment was administered for periodontitis. There was a high prevalence of periodontal diseases, moderate levels of dental caries, and elevated prevalence of oral mucosal lesions like tonsillar hypertrophy, pallor of the palate, lingual mycosis inflammation, and mucositis among sickle cell patients. The poor oral health-seeking behavior of the patients and poor oral hygiene practices might be responsible for the high burden of carious and periodontal diseases."

    "title": "In silico identification of PPARγ agonists from diffractaic acid analogs in prostate cancer: a comprehensive computational approach.",
    "abstract": "Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second most frequent and the fifth greatest cause of death in men. Although there are already therapies for early-stage PCa, their effectiveness in advanced PCa is limited, primarily because of medication resistance or poor efficacy. To find new therapeutic indications or repurpose current medications, this project intends to use computational approaches to investigate possible anti-PCa compounds based on simulated screening of FDA-approved drug bank databases. The techniques used in this study include virtual screening of the drug bank database utilising a matrix or user molecule (Diffractaic acid; DA), integrated network pharmacology, molecular docking, detailed molecular dynamic simulation. The results showed that 18 DA analogues in total were chosen from the drug bank database and put through integrated network pharmacology. The KEGG enrichment analysis indicated that hsa05215: Prostate cancer is one of the most significant PCa enrichment signalling pathways which exhibited 18 protein-protein interactions including PDGFRB, PDGFRA, PPARG, GSK3B, MAP2K1, CREBBP, HSP90AA1, HSP90AB1, CHUK, PIK3CD, BRAF, PIK3CB, MTOR, AR, PIK3CA, PLAU, CDK2, and MAPK1. Subsequent molecular docking study with the best target protein (PPARγ) showed that the DB14929 molecule formed hydrogen bonds with the Gln273, Arg280, Arg288, and Ser342 residues and exhibited a high binding affinity ( - 10.5 kcal/mol) for the PPARγ agonist against PCa. Furthermore, molecular dynamic simulation showed that DB14929 formed a stable protein-ligand complex with RMSD, RMSF, Rg, and SASA values. Furthermore, the dynamic behaviour of the PPARγ protein linked to DB14929 in its conformational space was analysed using the PCA technique, demonstrating the excellent conformational space behaviour. Additionally, the free binding energy value of - 57.15 kcal/mol of DB14929 indicated that it could be an agonist of PPARγ of PCa.

    "abstract": "According to the World Health Organization, about 5% of the world's population has the abnormal haemoglobin gene with Nigeria having the highest burden of sickle cell disease (SCD). Concerted efforts should target the reduction of SCD prevalence. This study aimed to determine the various factors that contribute to the non-dwindling prevalence of SCD in Nigeria. A community-based cross-sectional survey was carried out on 883 respondents aged 18 years and above between February 2021 and March 2023 in Enugu State, Nigeria. Interviewer-administered questionnaires were used to obtain relevant socio-demographic data, family history of SCD, knowledge of their haemoglobin phenotype, and information on any previous misdiagnosis of their haemoglobin phenotype. Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software program, version 26.0 (Chicago, Illinois) was used for data analysis. A value of P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Median age was 43 years with a range of 18-88 years. Seven hundred and forty-three (743/883, 81.1%) have done the test to ascertain their haemoglobin phenotype. On the other hand, 140 respondents (15.9%) have never done the test due to: lack of awareness (35/140, 25%); financial difficulties (53/140, 37.8%); religious reasons (35/140, 25%); discordant results (301/743, 40.5%) and not knowing where to go for the test (17/140, 12.1%). The distributions of the haemoglobin phenotypes were: HbAA (519/743, 69.9%); HbAS (196/743, 26.4%) and HbSS (28/743, 3.8%). Over one-tenth (15.9%) of the study population do not know their haemoglobin phenotype status and their reasons for non-testing are varied. The population prevalence of SCD (3.8%) is higher than the previously reported national prevalence range of 1 - 3%. Addressing the identified barriers to non-testing might help in checking the increasing prevalence of SCD in Nigeria."

    "abstract": "Individuals with thalassemia or sickle cell disease (SCD) are at an elevated risk of developing cancer, yet the full extent of this risk remains inadequately characterised. We conducted a systematic review using three databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE and Scopus) to compare the cancer risk in patients with thalassemia and SCD with that of the general population. Secondly, we assessed the impact of other putative risk factors in patients with thalassemia and SCD on cancer risk. Five studies from four countries were included, encompassing a total of 24,439 individuals overall. The risk estimates of developing cancer were highly variable, being affected by study design, population and comparators recruited, and type of cancer. The results showed an elevated cancer risk in SCD and thalassemia patient groups, with the highest incidence observed for hematologic malignancies (especially myeloid leukaemia in SCD patients). Patients with transfusion-dependent thalassemia had a significantly higher overall cancer risk, particularly hepatocellular carcinoma, compared to both non-transfusion-dependent patients and the general population. Other key factors seem to contribute to the increased cancer risk besides transfusion dependency, viral infections, and use of iron chelators. However, people with hemoglobinopathies appeared to be at lower risk of breast and prostate cancer compared to the general population. The findings are limited by variability among studies, including differences in control groups, inconsistent reporting of outcomes, and missing assessments of confounding factors. Therefore, future research with robust methods is essential to improve cancer surveillance and develop targeted prevention strategies for high-risk populations."

    "abstract": "Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) provides a curative option for patients with hemoglobinopathies by establishing donor-derived hematopoiesis. However, outcomes can be compromised by toxicities and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), particularly in patients older than 13 years. To evaluate the safety and benefit of extended duration (until day +365) abatacept incorporated into GVHD prophylaxis compared to the inclusion of prednisone in children and adolescents with hemoglobinopathy undergoing HCT from related and unrelated donors. Forty patients with hemoglobinopathy received reduced intensity conditioning and prednisone-inclusive GVHD prophylaxis. Outcomes were compared with 20 subsequent patients who received extended duration abatacept instead of prednisone. The incidence of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome was 17% with prednisone and 0% with abatacept. Acute grade 3-4 GVHD occurred in 28% of patients who received prednisone and in 0% that received abatacept (p=0.011). Among patients who received prednisone, chronic GVHD was observed in 2.5% (mild), 5% (moderate), and 30% (severe) of cases. In contrast, abatacept recipients experienced chronic GVHD at rates of 25% (mild), 5% (moderate), and 5% (severe). Oral involvement was most common in patients with chronic GVHD who received abatacept. Post-transplant immune reconstitution patterns were similar in both groups. Infection in the presence of GVHD and systemic immune suppression was the primary cause of mortality in patients who received prednisone. Two patients in the abatacept group developed EBV-associated lymphadenopathy that responded to rituximab. The only death following abatacept-inclusive prophylaxis was in a patient that died after primary graft rejection and a subsequent transplant. Overall survival and event-free survival were 87% and 80% (OS) with prednisone. The corresponding numbers were 95% and 90%, respectively, with abatacept despite a higher proportion of recipients at risk for poor outcomes (older age, mismatched grafts) in the abatacept group. Including extended duration abatacept to GVHD prophylaxis is effective in reducing the incidence and severity of GVHD and allows expansion of donor and transplant options in children and adolescents with hemoglobinopathy, with unrelated donor HCT outcomes matching those after matched sibling donor HCT."

    "title": "Musculoskeletal manifestations of sickle cell disease: an imaging perspective.",
    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a spectrum of inherited blood disorders, leading to propensity to sickling disruption of red blood cells. Musculoskeletal complications are a common cause of acute and chronic morbidities, related to the main pathophysiological processes: (i) hemolysis and anemia, resulting in marrow hyperplasia and extramedullary hematopoiesis; and (ii) vaso-occlusion, leading to osteonecrosis/bone infarction, myonecrosis, and infection (osteomyelitis and septic arthritis). Knowing the pathophysiology and clinical manifestations is essential for imaging interpretation, but differentiation between acute osteomyelitis and bone infarction remains a clinical and imaging challenge, therefore requiring a multidisciplinary approach. Large subperiosteal fluid collections (≥ 4 mm in depth), in conjunction with elevated inflammatory markers and white blood counts, are more suggestive of osteomyelitis rather than isolated bone infarction. The unenhanced T1-weighted fat-suppressed sequence on MR images was also proposed to aid in this differentiation, but so far with controversial results. Future perspectives of MR imaging include the DIXON technique, which has shown promising results as a biomarker of morbidity of SCD, through evaluation of fat fraction (FF) of bone marrow in a single acquisition and noninvasive way."

    "abstract": "Hemostasis in humans has traditionally been considered to a function of platelets, coagulation, and the subendothelial matrix, but the role of red blood cells (RBCs) has been increasingly recognized. RBCs regulate hemostasis through biophysical and biochemical means. For the former, faster-moving RBCs in the center of vessels marginalize platelets and plasma to the vessel walls, where the platelets constantly probe the endothelial surface for injury. RBC counts also determine blood viscosity, which regulates the shear stress of laminar blood flow. For the latter, RBCs are the largest pool of adenosine triphosphate, which, upon release, is rapidly hydrolyzed to adenosine diphosphate. Both ATP and ADP activate platelets. Quantitative and qualitative abnormalities in RBCs have also been consistently identified as significant risk factor for arterial and venous thrombosis. Thrombosis is a major complication associated with diseases such as polycythemia vera, secondary erythrocytosis, and sickle cell anemia, all of which present with changes in numbers and physical properties of RBCs. Thrombosis is also common in conditions with significant hemolysis, such as paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, severe infections, and when patients are on mechanical support. In this review, we discuss findings from clinical observations and mechanistic studies of how RBCs regulate hemostasis and contribute to thrombosis."

    "abstract": "Pharmacists have a vital role in sickle cell disease (SCD) management, particularly given the recent advancements in treatment options. Therefore, it is essential for pharmacy students to be knowledgeable about SCD to provide optimal care to affected individuals they may encounter. However, little is known regarding their knowledge of SCD. Thus, the objectives of this study were to: 1) describe pharmacy students' SCD knowledge and 2) determine if sociodemographic factors and previous SCD exposure were associated with their SCD knowledge. This cross-sectional study involved first- to fourth-year pharmacy students at a Central Texas university (N = 400). SCD knowledge was assessed using a 39-item survey covering various aspects of SCD (overall and domain-specific scores range: 0-100; higher scores = greater SCD knowledge). Data were collected in September 2024 and analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Of the 137 participants who responded, 108 completed >75 % of the survey items, resulting in a 27 % response rate. Participants had suboptimal SCD knowledge with an overall mean score of 43.0 ± 19.2. While knowledge was suboptimal (<70) in all aspects assessed, participants were most knowledgeable regarding SCD pain (67.6 ± 31.7) and least knowledgeable regarding pharmaceutical treatment of SCD (32.6 ± 28.2). Race/ethnicity, academic year, previous encounters with individuals with SCD, and receiving SCD course content during PharmD training were associated with SCD knowledge. Participants had suboptimal SCD knowledge, notably regarding pharmaceutical treatment. Targeted educational interventions such as including and reinforcing SCD course content in PharmD training could better prepare pharmacy students to care for individuals with SCD."

The molecular complexity of β-thalassemia involves over 350 mutations, resulting in reduced beta-globin synthesis, excess iron, and oxidative stress. Methods Chorionic villi samples from β-thalassemia carrier mothers collected through trans-abdominal chorionic villi sampling (TA-CVS) were screened by real-time polymerase chain reaction for the most commonly found β-globin gene mutations: IVS 1-1 (G>T), 619 bp deletion, IVS 1-5 (G>C), CD15 (G>A), FS41/42 (-TTCT), HbS, FS8/9 (+G), -90 (C>T), CD16 (-C), HbE, CD15 (-T), CD30 (G>C), and -28 (A>G) using TOCE™ (Tagging Oligonucleotide Cleavage and Extension) technology. Reduced glutathione (GSH), redox status (GSH/GSSG ratio), and endothelin-1 (ET-1) were investigated in foetuses of defined β-globin gene mutations by colorimetry and ELISA, respectively, to explore the potential of GSH and ET-1 as oxidative stress biomarkers. Results Of the total cases included in this study 40 per cent showed occurrence of HbS mutations with significant differences in GSH, GSSG, and redox ratio among mutation groups (P<0.05). Correlation analysis revealed a non-significant association between GSH and ET-1 levels. Interpretation & conclusions This study provides key insights into oxidative stress in foetuses with defined β-globin gene mutations. GSH and ET-1 may be therapeutic targets to mitigate oxidative stress and healthy placentation in pregnancies with haemoglobinopathies."

We used MRI to investigate whether the cross-sectional total inflow vessel luminal area (TIVLA) proximal to the circle of Willis (carotid arteries + basilar artery) would be increased in SCD compared to age- and sex-matched peers after adjusting for CBF. Across 36 children with SCD (19 female, median age 10.7 [8.0-14.5] years and 43 controls (26 female, median age 12.7 [9.2-18.2] years) matched by age (<i>p</i> = 0.13) and sex (<i>p</i> = 0.50), the median TIVLA in the SCD group (35.9 mm<sup>2</sup> [30.7, 39.5]) was larger than controls (30.5 mm<sup>2</sup> [27.8, 35.4], <i>p</i> = 0.002). In a mixed model including age, sex, hemoglobin, CBF, SCD status, and an interaction between hemoglobin and SCD status, CBF (β = 0.11, CI 0.02-0.20, <i>p</i> = 0.02), SCD (β = 28.02, CI 5.62-50.42, <i>p</i> = 0.015), and the interaction between SCD and hemoglobin (β = -2.48, CI -4.49 to -0.47, <i>p</i> = 0.018) were all significantly associated with increased TIVLA. Notably, TIVLA as a measure of arterial lumens is larger in children with SCD, even after adjusting for CBF in the mixed model. This implies disease-specific normative values may be needed to detect early vasculopathy."

    "abstract": "This study aims to evaluate the effect of sickle cell disease (SCD) as a comorbidity on seizure-related hospitalizations, with a focus on demographic disparities, clinical characteristics, and outcomes. Methods: This retrospective cohort study utilized the 2021 National Inpatient Sample (NIS) to identify patients admitted with a principal diagnosis of seizures. Patients were stratified into two groups based on the presence or absence of SCD as a comorbidity. Primary outcomes included in-hospital mortality, while secondary outcomes included hospital length of stay and total hospital charges. Multivariate logistic and linear regression models were used to adjust for confounders. Results: Among 263,625 patients hospitalized for seizures, 434 (0.17%) had a comorbid diagnosis of SCD. Patients with SCD were younger (mean age: 39.02 vs. 44.1 years, p < 0.05) and predominantly African American (78.82% vs. 22.76%, p < 0.05). They also had a higher Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) score and were more likely to have an ischemic stroke (4.44% vs. 1.16%, p < 0.05). However, after adjusting for confounders, SCD was not significantly associated with an increased in-hospital mortality (adjusted OR: 1.60, 95% CI: 0.22-11.44, p = 0.637), length of stay (p = 0.825), or total hospital charges (p = 0.827). Conclusion: Despite notable demographic and clinical differences, the presence of SCD as a comorbidity did not significantly impact in-hospital mortality, length of stay, or hospital charges in seizure-related hospitalizations."

    "abstract": "Critical illness-associated cerebral microbleeds (CICMs) are a recent clinical entity described as occurring in critically ill and mechanically ventilated patients, especially those with a risk of cerebral hypoxia. CICMs have been associated with progressive cognitive decline, and the management is supportive. We report the case of a 29-year-old male patient with sickle cell disease admitted for vaso-occlusive crises, which was complicated by multifocal pneumonia, and acute chest syndrome requiring intensive care unit admission and mechanical ventilation. He was noted to have poor mental status off sedation, with a brain MRI showing innumerable microhemorrhages throughout the bilateral cerebral and cerebellar hemispheres, suggestive of CICM."

    "abstract": "Prevalence of sickle cell disease (SCD) across African countries ranges between 1-3% and contributes up to 7-16% of under-five mortality. In order to bridge the gap in management and cognate research, the SickleInAfrica consortium was established in 2017 to facilitate collaboration among African nations in order to establish regionally relevant healthcare standards for SCD patients. This work utilised the SickleInAfrica platform to study the levels of HbF and F cells and their relationship with sickle cell disease clinical manifestations in Ghana, Nigeria and Tanzania. This study enrolled 290 individuals with SCD aged five years and above who were confirmed to be at steady state and were hydroxyurea naïve. Clinical history was obtained using an interviewer-administered questionnaire. Haematological parameters were determined by an automated haematology analyser, while quantification of HbF and F cells was implemented by high-performance liquid chromatography and flow cytometry, respectively. Age-adjusted logistic regression was employed to assess the association of HbF with the clinical manifestations. The most reported complication of SCD, requiring management in a hospital setting is pain crises, ranging from 66-96% with the highest in Tanzania and lowest in Ghana. HbF and F cell parameters show significant association with transfusion rates, frequency of painful crises and episodes of febrile illness. This work highlights important differences and similarities across SCD populations in the three countries. This is important especially in development of interventions in the light of personalised medicine."

    "abstract": "This Review examines the pace of public health-related gene therapy and gene editing development since the publication of a key British white paper in 2003. A case approach to assessing progress is used, where the cases represent illustrative health conditions we have discussed with our public health students. Three overarching baskets are considered: (1) gene therapy and editing for rare, single gene disorders (e.g., homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia and hereditary amyloidosis polyneuropathy); (2) gene therapy and editing for high prevalence conditions (e.g., sickle cell disease); and (3) genetic engineering and gene editing of mosquitoes transmitting tropical disease. The largest number of public health-related trials listed in this purposive inspection have made Phase III (comparing treatments), with several in Phase II (establishing efficacy) and Phase I (assessing safety). Cost-benefit considerations will limit the bulk of gene therapies from receiving Medicaid support which would benefit diverse groups, though criteria do exist for public backing. A scenario is described where several gene therapies relating to public health conditions could be supported by public insurance and justifiably meet the public health goals of effectiveness and equity. These instances are contrasted with human germline gene editing using CRISPR/Cas9 technology, and localized efforts to control vector populations with gene drives. Future debates will reflect extensions of the current applications, with secondary research undertaking cross-sectional inspections of sets of gene therapy and gene editing clinical trials. A limited number of protocols could advance to public financing and receive public health support; indications for such usage need further defining. Considerations of benefit to diverse populations are an important hallmark of public health-related regimens."

The aim of this study was to describe severe Parvovirus B19 infections in adult patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). In this multicentre, retrospective, observational cohort study, adult patients with SCD admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) between 2011 and 2024 with acute Parvovirus B19 infection were included. Unsupervised analysis was performed including clinical and biological characteristics to identify clusters of patients with different outcomes. Clinical phenotypes were defined based on patient clustering. Parvovirus B19 genomes from ICU (n=15) and non-ICU control patients (n=15) admitted to the hospital during the same period were sequenced and compared. Sixty-one patients (52% female, median age: 29 years [IQR: 24;38]) from eight ICUs in France were included. Three clusters of patients were identified. From these clusters, three groups of patients with distinct clinical phenotype were identified: erythroblastopenia (n=26), bone marrow necrosis (BMN) and fat cerebral embolism syndrome (CFE) (n=17), and other vaso-occlusive manifestations (n=18). Length of stay in the ICU and hospital was longer in patients with BMN/CFE. There was no difference in Parvovirus B19 genotype or NS1 or VP1/2 amino-acid diversity between the groups. Similar results were observed between patients who were admitted to the ICU and those who were not. ICU patients with SCD and acute Parvovirus B19 infection presented three clinical phenotypes associated with different initial severity and outcome, but with similar Parvovirus B19 clades and amino-acid diversity."

    "title": "Hospital Readmissions Among People With Sickle Cell Disease.",
    "abstract": "While advances in the management and treatment of sickle cell disease (SCD), the most common inherited disorder in the United States, have improved outcomes, hospital readmissions remain a significant concern. Thirty-day hospital readmissions is a key quality-of-care indicator; however, there are limited contemporary nationally representative data on SCD readmissions. To characterize national trends in SCD-related readmissions in the United States and describe factors associated with readmission among patients with SCD. This cohort study included patients with SCD aged 18 years and older. Patients were identified in the Nationwide Readmissions Database (NRD), an all-payer database of US hospitalizations, using International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) codes. Data were collected from January 2016 to December 2021 and analyzed from May to September 2024. Readmission was defined as subsequent admission within 30 days of hospitalization discharge using the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services methodology. The 30-day all-cause unplanned readmission risk among adults with SCD was estimated, and the trend in 30-day readmissions among adults with and without SCD was assessed by calendar year from 2016 to 2021. Survey-weighted mixed-effect Poisson regressions were used to identify factors associated with readmission. From 2016 to 2021, 140 096 807 all-cause index hospitalizations and 592 951 SCD-related index hospitalizations were analyzed. Patients with SCD had a stable readmission risk of approximately 34% (annual range, 32.6%-34.3%), significantly higher per year than the approximately 12% readmission risk among patients without SCD (annual range, 12.0%-12.2%) (P < .001). In 2021, there were 92 536 index admissions from 37 410 unique patients with SCD (median [IQR] age, 34 [26-46] years; 22 484 [60.1%] female), with 30 467 readmissions. Younger patients (aged 18-29 years) had the highest readmission risk at 35.1%. In multivariable model among patients with SCD, patients from the highest-income zip codes had lower readmission risk than those from lower-income areas (adjusted risk ratio [aRR], 0.90; 95% CI, 0.84-0.97). Admissions paid by Medicare and Medicaid were associated with higher readmission risk than private insurance (Medicare: aRR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.56-1.78; Medicaid: aRR,1.53; 95% CI, 1.43-1.63). Vaso-occlusive crises at index admission were associated with higher readmission risk (aRR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.25-1.37). Fewer readmissions were observed in patients receiving simple (aRR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.82-0.91) and exchange (aRR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.61-0.99) red blood cell transfusions. In this cohort study with nationally representative data, patients with SCD had a significantly higher readmission risk than patients without SCD. Preventative, disease-modifying, and curative interventions are needed to reduce readmission risks and improve outcomes for patients with SCD."

    "abstract": "Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a common chronic complication of sickle cell disease (SCD), and patients at risk for PH can be identified by measuring tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity (TRJV). We looked for the possible efficacy of L-arginine for children with SCD who have elevated TRJV. In total, 50 children with SCD who had TRJV higher than 2.5 m/s were randomly divided into two groups, each with 25 patients: group 1 (control group) and group 2 (treatment group). Group 2 received L-arginine at a dose of 0.1-0.2 g/kg/day for 3 months. Transthoracic echocardiography was conducted to measure TRJV at baseline and after 3 months, and blood samples were collected at baseline and after 3 months to assess serum levels of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), nitric oxide (NO), L-arginine (LA), asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), and LA/ADMA ratio. After 3 months of treatment, the L-arginine-treated group had significantly lower TRJV levels than the control group, and compared with baseline. They also had significantly lower NT-proBNP and significantly higher NO, LA and LA/ADMA ratios than the control group and compared with baseline. No significant differences in side effects were observed between the two groups, indicating that L-arginine is safe for these patients. L-arginine is associated with a reduction in TRJV, NT-proBNP, and improvements in NO biomarkers, suggesting it may be beneficial for reducing the risk of pulmonary hypertension in children with sickle cell disease.

    "abstract": "Pyruvate kinase (PK) is an important glycolytic enzyme responsible for erythrocytic ATP production. PK allosteric activators have been shown to increase ATP and reduce 2,3-disphosphoglycerate among red blood cells leading to improved oxygen affinity, sickling, and hemolysis. In this systematic review, we aim to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PK activators in hemolytic anemias. This study was conducted following the PRISMA guidelines. A literature search was conducted using relevant keywords over PubMed/Medline, Google Scholar, Cochrane Library, and clinicaltrial.gov, till 29 September 2024. Relevant data was extracted into a spreadsheet and synthesized qualitatively. The literature search yielded 7,153 results, with 7 studies ultimately included in the review. These studies involved 206 patients, 166 of whom received mitapivat and the rest received placebo. Hemoglobin response was achieved by 38.0% to 80.0% of participants receiving mitapivat, with an average increase of 0.4 to 1.7 g/dL. Most studies reported improvements in bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase, haptoglobin, and reticulocyte levels. Adverse events (AEs) were experienced by 93.2% of participants, with rates of 93.97% and 89.7% in the intervention and control groups, respectively. However, most AEs were mild and transient, and 23.4% were graded as 3 or higher. In this study, PK activators, particularly mitapivat, demonstrated promising efficacy and safety profiles in managing hemolytic anemias. These agents significantly improved hemoglobin levels, markers of hemolysis, and hematopoietic response, offering a beneficial therapeutic option for various hemolytic conditions, including pyruvate kinase deficiency, sickle cell disease, and thalassemia.

We report the case of a 13-year-old girl presenting with sudden-onset right-sided weakness, facial deviation, and aphasia. Neuroimaging revealed a left fronto-parietal infarct with hemorrhagic transformation and left middle cerebral artery thrombosis. Peripheral smear showed sickle cells; high-performance liquid chromatography indicated sickle beta thalassemia (HbS 76%, HbA2 5.3%, HbA 7.7%). Genetic analysis confirmed compound heterozygosity: HBB: c.20A>T (codon 6 A>T, sickle cell mutation) and HBB: c.92+5G>C (IVS 1-5 G>C, beta thalassemia mutation). She was managed with exchange transfusions and initiated on hydroxyurea. Family screening revealed her father was a sickle trait carrier, her mother a beta-thalassemia carrier, and her asymptomatic brother had the same compound heterozygosity. Arterial stroke can be an atypical and rare presentation of sickle beta thalassemia, highlighting the quiet progression of hemoglobinopathies and the necessity for heightened clinical suspicion. Early diagnosis through family screening and timely intervention can prevent catastrophic complications in at-risk individuals."

Before February 2023 (v.44), protocols specific to sickle cell disease did not address key psychosocial factors or social determinants of health that impact care and outcomes. This paper describes the protocol selection process and final recommendations to address this limitation. To identify protocols for the new collection, the PhenX Sickle Cell Disease Research and Scientific Panel provided a list of scope elements for consideration and assembled a panel with relevant expertise in psychology, behavioral science, hematology, and nursing to form a Psychosocial and Social Determinants of Health Working Group. A consensus process prioritized and identified the scope elements and protocols. The 19 scope elements and related protocols initially selected were shared with the scientific community for public comment, informing final selections. The final 15 recommended protocols assess transition readiness, self-management, impact of early aging, stigma, trust in medical care and research, resilience, spirituality, and stress responses. Another 8 protocols were selected as supplemental information. Sickle cell-relevant social determinants of health protocols were also cross-listed from other PhenX Toolkit Collections. Recommended protocols enhance the existing Sickle Cell Disease Research Collections and the individual and structural Social Determinants of Health Collections in the PhenX Toolkit. Furthermore, the protocols will promote using validated measurement tools to investigate psychosocial factors and social determinants in sickle cell disease."

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is one of the most frequent monogenic diseases worldwide and a highly heterogeneous and complex disease. SCD care carries several challenges. This includes early and accurate diagnosis as well as optimal red blood cell transfusion matching in this population carrying a high risk of alloimmunization. For decades, molecular biology has used hemoglobin and SCD as models for the development of several molecular tools. Such tools can now be used for various aspects of SCD care. Molecular diagnosis is notably the root of noninvasive prenatal testing. In postnatal diagnosis, including newborn screening, molecular approaches can overcome several limitations of protein-based methods. Simple approaches such as polymerase chain reaction can be used as a high-throughput and low-cost screening test. Moreover, combining sequence and deletion analyses allows for a comprehensive study of the β-globin locus, resolving complex cases. In transfusion care, genotyping for blood group determination has been shown to be more accurate compared to protein-based serological testing. Future development of molecular testing in SCD includes their use as prognostic tools and recent molecular diagnosis approaches. However, despite carrying major advantages, molecular testing may also present some limitations, such as high cost, limited accessibility in many countries, and limited information using targeted approaches. Molecular testing has a different pattern of advantages and limitations than protein-based analyses. Therefore, the optimal use of molecular testing is frequently not as a standalone approach but in combination with protein-based techniques. The optimal combination depends on the resources available and the clinical challenge, to ultimately improve SCD care."

The disease can affect the kidney through various mechanisms, including vaso-occlusion, ischemia-reperfusion, endothelial dysfunction, and hemolysis-induced renal injury. This article describes the case of a 41-year-old woman with sickle cell disease who presented with a hemolytic crisis, developed acute kidney injury (AKI), 8g of proteinuria in 24h, and required renal support therapy. A renal biopsy was performed, revealing focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), severe acute tubular necrosis, interstitial fibrosis with moderate tubular atrophy, and pigment casts. Thus, histochemistry was performed with a positive reaction for iron with evidence of intraluminal and cytoplasmic granular deposits in the proximal tubules compatible with hemosiderin and negative for hemoglobin. The case of this patient with sickle cell disease and AKI illustrates the importance of considering hemoglobin cast nephropathy as a potential cause."

This review aimed to systematically evaluate the current literature for cortisol measurement and methodology among individuals with SCD and synthesize findings of biopsychosocial correlates in this population. A systematic search of medical databases was conducted, resulting in 20 studies meeting inclusion criteria, involving 710 participants with SCD and 454 control participants without SCD. Cortisol was primarily measured using serum (k=10) and plasma (k=8), and few studies utilized salivary (k=1) or hair (k=1) measurements. Most studies investigated cortisol in comparison to a control group (k=14). Qualitative findings were inconsistent, and quantitative meta-analytic data (k=12) imply no significant difference in cortisol in SCD participants relative to healthy controls (serum Hedges' g = -1.51, 95% CI = -3.99 to 0.97; plasma Hedges' g = -0.72, 95% CI= -1.56 to 0.13). Additionally, studies examined cortisol in comparison to adrenal standards (k=5), responses to adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation (k=7), and correlations with vaso-occlusive crises (k =3) and disease severity (k=3). Few studies explored medication (k=2) or behavioral correlates (k=1) of cortisol. Finally, no study investigated the influence of psychosocial stressors on cortisol levels.

    "abstract": "Sickle cell anemia (SCA) patients are characterized by poorly deformable and fragile red blood cells (RBCs). Few studies reported an increased cholesterol content in SCA RBC membrane. However, the consequences of this elevated cholesterol level in the above-mentioned RBC alterations are currently unknown. The aim of this study was to assess, in vitro, the effects of BRN-002 (2-Hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin derivate (HPBCD)), a cholesterol-depleting molecule, on RBC membrane cholesterol, hemolysis and RBC sickling and deformability in SCA patients. Forty patients with SCA and 10 healthy individuals (AA) were included in the different experiments of the study. SCA RBCs were incubated with BRN-002 and the following parameters were assessed: i) RBC and supernatant cholesterol content; ii) RBC deformability by oxygen-gradient ektacytometry; iii) hemolysis by measuring free hemoglobin concentration. Results confirmed that SCA patients have increased RBC membrane cholesterol compared to AA. BRN-002 effectively removed cholesterol in SCA RBC membrane and reduced free hemoglobin release during incubation. BRN-002 also increased RBC deformability in hypoxia and decreased the pO<sub>2</sub> at which sickling occurs. These findings suggest that excess of RBC membrane cholesterol may participate in the typical RBC alterations found in SCA patients. Therefore, interventions focusing on RBC-cholesterol removal may be beneficial for SCA patients."

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most prevalent inherited haemoglobinopathy characterised by chronic pain with acute painful episodes due to vaso-occlusion. The effective management of pain by adults with SCD influences their health outcomes. Opioids remain essential for most pain syndromes, but non-pharmacological interventions are preferred for daily pain due to the risk of addiction. However, their effectiveness is variable. Understanding the underlying processes associated with pain is crucial for developing more effective non-pharmacological strategies. This study aimed to enhance comprehension of the pain mechanisms in SCD to identify potential areas of action for effective non-pharmacological interventions. An evaluation was conducted on the severity and interference of pain, pain-related cognitions and emotions. We used network analysis to simultaneously examine the intricate relationships between these variables. A pain intensity exceeding 4 at a steady state distinguishes a subgroup at elevated risk of negative pain-related emotions and cognitions. The network analysis revealed intricate interconnections, with three distinct subgroups of variables mimicking the Neuromatrix model (cognitive-evaluative, motivational-affective and sensory-discriminative subgroups). The derived directed acyclic graph suggests potential mechanisms between these three subgroups, with catastrophising having a pivotal role. This study extends previous research by providing a comprehensive network analysis of pain-related variables in SCD, offering novel insights into the complex interplay between pain experience, cognitions and emotions. These findings have important clinical implications, as they suggest that targeting dysfunctional pain cognitions and/or negative emotions may be beneficial for improving pain management and quality of life in SCD. This study was the first to use network analyses to understand simultaneously multiple relationships between variables referring to pain, and pain-related negative emotions and cognitions in adults with SCD. Findings, providing support to the Neuromatrix model, offer novel insight to better understand pain and the associated negative emotions and cognition in SCD. The derived directed acyclic graph explored potential underlying psychological processes associated with pain that could be specifically targeted by future effective psychological interventions."

This study seeks to identify predictors of fasting capability and investigate the effects of fasting among this patient population. This cross-sectional study enrolled adult Muslim patients with SCD from Saudi Arabia. Data were collected through direct interviews using a structured questionnaire with four sections. A total of 320 patients with SCD were evaluated, with a mean age of 32.6 years (SD ± 11.01) and the majority were females (63.1%). Among these participants, 214 (66.9%) observed Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF) while 106 (33.1%) did not observe the fasting month or had interrupted fasting. Participants having secondary and university education were nearly twice as likely to fast the entire Ramadan (<i>p</i> = 0.025 and <i>p</i> = 0.003, respectively). History of SCD crises, emergency visits, acute chest syndrome, and intensive care unit admission were all significantly associated with lower odds of fasting the entire month (OR = 0.25, <i>p</i> = 0.019; OR = 0.25, <i>p</i> = 0.001; OR = 0.57, <i>p</i> = 0.035; and OR = 0.46, <i>p</i> = 0.003, respectively). Participants with more than four SCD episodes or more than four emergency room visits had significantly higher odds of experiencing complications within 30 days following Ramadan (OR = 3.31, <i>p</i> < 0.001 and OR = 2.55, <i>p</i> = 0.004, respectively). The effects of observing RIF on individuals with SCD are generally subtle during the month but more significant in the post-fasting phase. The capacity to predict an individual's ability to fast and likelihood of post-fasting complications is substantially influenced by a range of sociodemographic factors such as education level as well as clinical variables, including frequency of annual hospitalizations, emergency room visits, intensive care unit admissions, occurrences of acute chest syndrome, and the presence of thrombocytosis. A Comprehensive evaluation of these factors will provide enhanced guidance for medical practitioners, facilitating more informed and insightful decisions regarding patient fasting recommendations."

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a major contributor to morbidity and mortality in sub-Saharan Africa, and early detection through neonatal screening can improve outcomes. In Senegal, systematic screening is not yet implemented. This study describes two cohorts of children diagnosed with SCD: those identified through neonatal screening and those diagnosed clinically after presenting symptoms. This retrospective study involved two cohorts of children diagnosed with SCD in St. Louis, Senegal, between 2010 and 2020-one through neonatal screening (A) and the other clinically (B). Epidemiological, clinical, and management data were analyzed. Cohort A included 17,083 screened infants (74% screening rate), with 40 diagnosed at a mean age of 70.48 days, showing low complication rates and requiring less intensive treatment. Cohort B, with 39 clinically diagnosed children, had a mean diagnosis age of 21.9 months, with higher rates of hospitalizations, transfusions, and acute anemia. Vaccination and antibiotic prophylaxis were high in both cohorts. Neonatal screening enables early diagnosis, reducing complications and enabling timely interventions, while children diagnosed after symptoms face more severe disease. Early genetic counseling and addressing consanguinity are key for better outcomes. Challenges such as limited funding, equipment, and trained personnel must be addressed for broader implementation. Neonatal screening aligns with public health goals by reducing morbidity and mortality, and the long-term economic burden on families and healthcare systems. It is particularly relevant in the context of increasing global migration patterns, underscoring the need for such programs worldwide."

    "title": "Newly Diagnosed Hemoglobin SC Disease Presenting With Choledocholithiasis With Acute Obstructive Cholangitis: A Case Report.",
    "abstract": "Hemoglobin SC disease (HbSC) is a sickle cell disease (SCD) that is considered to be mild compared to Hemoglobin SS (HbSS) disease. Both HbSS and HbSC can present with classic SCD complications such as hemolytic anemia, vaso-occlusive complications, functional aplenia, avascular necrosis, and cholelithiasis; however, HbSC generally has less severe and less frequent complications and can often be asymptomatic. As a result, HbSC is often underdiagnosed until a patient presents with a clinically significant complication. We present a case of newly diagnosed HbSC presenting with potentially life-threatening acute cholangitis due to choledocholithiasis. This case report serves to demonstrate that serious complications can occur in patients with HbSC. Additionally, early screening and diagnosis of HbSC in high-risk patients may allow for earlier treatment and potentially reduce the incidence of complications and increase patient quality of life."

    "title": "Evidence of inequities experienced by the rare disease community with respect to receipt of a diagnosis and access to services: a scoping review of UK and international evidence.",
    "abstract": "People with a rare disease find it difficult to obtain a diagnosis and access appropriate services. Evidence suggests that this can lead to health inequity amongst the rare disease community, i.e. systemic, unfair and avoidable differences in health opportunities and outcomes. This scoping review aims to identify and describe evidence on health inequities experienced by the rare disease community with regards to receipt of a diagnosis and access to health and social care services. We searched ASSIA, CINAHL, Embase, HMIC, MEDLINE and Social Policy and Practice for relevant studies. Studies were double screened at title and abstract and full-text using pre-specified inclusion criteria. As this research was commissioned by the UK National Institute for Health and Care Research Policy Research Programme, primary studies were limited to UK settings. These were supplemented with international systematic reviews. We also applied a 2010 date limit. Relevant data were extracted and presented narratively and tabulated. One hundred thirty-six studies met the inclusion criteria, including 96 primary studies and 40 systematic reviews. The most frequently occurring rare diseases were motor neurone disease, cystic fibrosis and sickle cell disease. Seventeen types of inequity were identified: delayed diagnosis, lack of knowledge amongst clinicians, lack of information provision, limited services provision (across six different services), limited services for undiagnosed conditions, lack of care co-ordination; in addition, inequity was identified relating to place of residence, race/ethnicity, gender, socioeconomic status, age and disability. This review has drawn attention to experiences of the rare disease community with respect to receipt of a diagnosis and access to services which are different to experiences in the general population, and within the rare disease community itself. Some of these experiences are clearly attributable to factors which are unfair, avoidable and systemic, particularly those which relate to specific groups in the rare disease community. Experiences relating to delayed diagnosis, lack of knowledge, information, care co-ordination and access to various services, also appeared to indicate inequity. These issues are less likely to be encountered with respect to more common diseases experienced in the general population."

    "abstract": "Whereas pregnancy in sickle cell disease (SCD) is considered high risk, there is limited understanding of pregnancy- and SCD-related morbidity to inform clinical practice and health policy. This retrospective cohort study aimed to describe pregnancy- and disease-related morbidity among individuals with SCD for up to 1 year postpartum using Medicaid claims (2010-2018) linked with newborn screening and clinical reports from four state Sickle Cell Data Collection programs. Medicaid enrollees aged 15-44 years with SCD were included. The most recent delivery hospitalization and associated complications were identified using the International Classification of Diseases nineth and tenth revisions. The main outcomes included pregnancy- and disease-related complications during pregnancy, at delivery, and up to 1 year post-delivery. A total of 1286 individuals met the inclusion criteria (43% were 15-24 years old, 50% were 25-34 years old). Most (n = 957, 74%) were enrolled in Medicaid before pregnancy, 88% (n = 1132) were enrolled within their first 16 weeks of pregnancy, and 68% (n = 876) maintained Medicaid coverage for 1 year postpartum. High incidence of SCD-related morbidities including vaso-occlusive crisis (37.6%) and acute chest syndrome (5.8%), and obstetric complications-preeclampsia/eclampsia (9.6%), antepartum hemorrhage (24.2%), and preterm delivery (28.1%)-were reported through 60 days postpartum. Many individuals continued to have SCD-related complications beyond the 60-day postpartum period, including more than one-third having a vaso-occlusive crisis. Individuals with SCD are at increased risk of pregnancy- and SCD-related morbidity throughout the perinatal period. Medicaid policies that ensure continuous coverage and encourage comprehensive multidisciplinary care models may reduce both SCD and obstetric complications and promote better maternal outcomes."

    "title": "Improving shared decision‑making between paediatric haematologists, children with sickle cell disease, and their parents: an observational post-intervention study.",
    "abstract": "Children with sickle cell disease (SCD) suffer from a chronic disease that can lead to serious co-morbidity and impacts their quality of life. During the course of their disease, a variety of health-related decisions need to be made for and by SCD-patients, depending on their age and health status, together with their parents and paediatric haematology clinicians. Shared decision-making (SDM) may improve health outcomes of chronically ill children but is still not commonly applied. We assessed the level of SDM among paediatric haematologists after the introduction of SDM interventions. An observational post-intervention study was conducted in a paediatric outpatient clinic of a university hospital. After an SDM consultation training of the three paediatric haematologists and introduction of SDM-supporting tools for both paediatricians and (parents of) patients with SCD, two evaluators independently and objectively analysed the level of patient involvement in decision-making from audio-recordings of the consultations using the OPTION-5 instrument. SDM-Q-9 and SDM-Q-Doc questionnaires were used to measure the level of SDM as perceived by patients/parents and paediatricians, respectively. Scores were expressed as a percentage, ranging from 0% (no SDM observed) to 100% (exemplary level of SDM). Participants were 9 female and 9 male patients between 4 months and 17 years old, with a median age of 7.5 years (Interquartile Range [IQR] 2.5-12). Eighteen consultations (six per paediatrician) in which a decision was to be made about SCD treatment options were analysed. Median OPTION-5 score was 50 (IQR 40-65%). Median SDM-Q-9 and SDM-Q-Doc scores were 73% (IQR 52.2-91) and 62.2% (IQR 55.6-71.1), respectively. After the introduction of SDM training and tools, paediatric haematologists reached a moderately good level of SDM. This level had doubled as compared to the baseline level, as assessed in a previous study. • Children who suffer from sickle cell disease (SCD) are vulnerable to health inequities and suboptimal health outcomes. Hence, SDM seems an appropriate method of care for these children. • SDM tools and training may help paediatricians and children participate in a collaborative decision-making process about the children's preferred treatment options and improve their health outcomes. • After SDM training and decision support aids for paediatricians and patients, the level of involvement in the decision-making process by (the parents of) patients suffering from SCD reached a moderately good level. • A difference persists between paediatricians' perceived level of involving the child and parents in a shared decision-making process and the observed level of involvement."

    "title": "Clinical consultation: The pharmacist's role in hydroxyurea management for sickle cell disease.",
    "abstract": "In an effort to expedite the publication of articles, AJHP is posting manuscripts online as soon as possible after acceptance. Accepted manuscripts have been peer-reviewed and copyedited, but are posted online before technical formatting and author proofing. These manuscripts are not the final version of record and will be replaced with the final article (formatted per AJHP style and proofed by the authors) at a later time. Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic disorder caused by a mutation in the β-globin gene, leading to the production of abnormal sickle hemoglobin (HbS). This clinical consultation explores the pivotal role of hydroxyurea as a disease-modifying therapy in SCD and examines how pharmacist-led interventions can optimize its use to improve patient outcomes. Hydroxyurea increases fetal hemoglobin (HbF) production, reducing HbS polymerization and lowering the frequency of vaso-occlusive crises, acute chest syndrome, and other complications. Despite its proven efficacy, barriers such as poor adherence, inadequate patient education, and suboptimal dosing hinder its effective use. Pharmacists, as integral members of the multidisciplinary care team, are ideally positioned to address these challenges. By providing patient education, regular laboratory monitoring, and dose titration to the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), pharmacists can enhance hydroxyurea's therapeutic benefits. Studies have shown that pharmacist-managed protocols significantly improve adherence, increase the proportion of patients achieving MTD, and lead to better clinical outcomes, such as higher HbF levels and fewer hospitalizations. Although emerging treatments such as gene therapies offer promise, hydroxyurea remains the most accessible and effective option for many patients. Pharmacists play a crucial role in optimizing hydroxyurea therapy for patients with SCD by improving adherence and maximizing dosing strategies. Their involvement ensures that more patients experience the full therapeutic benefits of hydroxyurea, contributing to better long-term outcomes. Expanding pharmacist engagement in SCD management will continue to be essential, particularly as new treatments are developed."

    "title": "Targeting PIEZO1-TMEM16F Coupling to Mitigate Sickle Cell Disease Complications.",
    "abstract": "A deeper understanding of sickle cell disease (SCD) pathophysiology is critical for identifying novel therapeutic targets. A hallmark of SCD is abnormal phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure on sickle red blood cells (RBCs), which contributes to anemia, thrombosis, and vaso-occlusive crises (VOC). However, the mechanisms underlying this excessive PS exposure remain unclear. Here, we identify TMEM16F, a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated lipid scramblase, as a key mediator of PS exposure downstream of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through the mechanosensitive channel PIEZO1 in sickle RBCs. Electrophysiology, imaging and flow cytometry reveal that deoxygenation-induced sickling promotes PIEZO1 activation, triggering Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry, TMEM16F activation, and PS exposure. This cascade enhances PS<sup>+</sup> microparticle release, thrombin generation, and RBC adhesion to endothelial cells. Notably, partial PIEZO1 inhibition with benzbromarone, an anti-gout drug, suppresses these changes. Our findings thus define a previously unrecognized mechanotransduction pathway in sickle RBCs and propose a unique therapeutic strategy to mitigate hypercoagulability and vaso-occlusion associated with SCD."

    "abstract": "Vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC), a common clinical manifestation of sickle cell disease (SCD), is mediated by a series of inflammatory responses. Conversely, a high fetal hemoglobin (Hb F) level is a known factor that reduces the severity of clinical presentations associated with SCD. Since the association between cytokine profiles and high Hb F levels in SCD is not well studied, this study aims to investigate the interaction between cytokines and Hb F levels in SCD patients from Odisha, India. A total of 276 patients with SCD were recruited for the study, including 180 in steady state and 90 in crisis state. Additionally, 117 individuals with sickle cell trait (SCT) and 128 healthy controls were included for comparison. The study revealed that the total white blood cell count and interleukin (IL)-6 levels were significantly higher in crisis state SCD patients, while the red cell distribution width, IL-10, and Hb F level were significantly higher in steady state SCD patients. Most importantly, the logistic regression analysis showed that the interaction of Hb F with the cytokines IL-10, IL-1β, and IL-17 provided three times greater protection from crisis in SCD patients. The significance of these preliminary findings has been discussed in terms of prognostic markers and supplements to increase the efficacy of hydroxyurea used to enhance Hb F production."

    "abstract": "Depression among patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) is crucial as it is often underdiagnosed and undertreated. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the prevalence of depression and to identify its determinants. This cross-sectional study was conducted in the Bardiya district of Nepal, based on registered cases of SCD. Depression was measured using the validated Nepalese version of the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). A random sample of 358 participants with SCD aged >13 years was included in the study. Descriptive and inferential statistics were applied to sociodemographic, clinical and psychological variables. Logistic regression analysis was performed for bivariate analysis. Variables with a <i>p</i> value of less than 0.05 were subjected to final multivariate logistic regression. The prevalence of depression was 36.31% among patients with SCD, age (<i>p</i> = 0.0178), education (<i>p</i> = 0.0178) and sociodemographic status (<i>p</i> = 0.0328) were strongly associated. Factors such as patients aged 40-49 years (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 3.05), complications due to SCD (AOR = 1.86) and genetic counselling group (AOR = 4.72) had higher chances of experiencing depression compared to their relative counterparts. However, patients with lower middle-class economic status, who experience pain crisis, with moderate self-esteem and who experience discrimination were 52%, 83%, 58% and 58% less likely to have depression compared to their respective counterparts, respectively. Depression was prevalent in patients with SCD, and multiple sociodemographic, clinical and psychological factors were strongly associated. This warrants the urgent need for early diagnosis and treatment of depression among participants with SCD."

    "abstract": "Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) places a significant psychological and social burden on patients and their caregivers, often leading to stigma that further diminishes their quality of life. Despite the huge burden of SCD and associated stigma in India, not much research has been done, and no stigma measurement tool is available. Hence, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has undertaken a multi-centric study to develop the ICMR-SCD Stigma Scale for India (ISSSI). A systematic approach was employed, beginning with item generation, content validity assessment, pretesting and psychometric validation. This process included exploratory factor analysis demonstrating strong factor loadings. Subsequently, confirmatory factor analysis was conducted to assess model fit, leading to refined scales of 16 items for patients and 17 items for caregivers. This study explicitly developed and validated the ISSSI for Indian SCD patients (ISSSI-Pt) and their caregivers (ISSSI-Cg). The finalized scales capture multidimensional aspects of stigma, including familial and reproductive, social disclosure, illness burden, interpersonal, and healthcare interaction challenges. The findings underscore the scales' psychometric robustness and utility in clinical and research settings. The methodological rigour employed in the scale development makes it a robust tool for understanding SCD-related stigma among Indian SCD patients and their caregivers in clinical and research contexts. The development of the ISSSI represents a significant advancement in understanding and addressing the multifaceted stigma associated with SCD in India. Future studies should apply these scales across diverse cultural and linguistic contexts to enhance their generalizability and impact.

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic disorder marked by abnormal hemoglobin polymerization, resulting in impaired red blood cell function. Activation of pyruvate kinase (PK), a key enzyme in glycolysis, has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy to enhance red blood cell metabolism and mitigate disease severity. This study employed a comprehensive computational approach, integrating molecular docking, density functional theory (DFT), molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, and absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) predictions to identify novel allosteric activators of PK. In the virtual screening of the Enamine and Asinex libraries of chemical compounds, ten compounds were identified as top candidates with superior docking affinities and binding free energies compared to the reference compound Mitapivat. Among these, compounds Z169572442 and Z432281300 were prioritized based on their strong binding interactions with the PK protein. DFT studies on these two compounds further validated their electronic properties, including frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs), reinforcing their potential as allosteric activators. MD simulation confirmed the stability of the PK-ligand complexes, as evidenced by consistent RMSD, RMSF, and protein-ligand contact profiles. ADMET analysis revealed favorable pharmacokinetic properties, with minor water solubility and distribution concerns. These findings support the potential of Z169572442 and Z432281300 as promising PK activators and lay the groundwork for further experimental validation, aiming to develop effective therapies for SCD."

    "abstract": "Novel automated digital malaria diagnostic tests are being developed with the advancement of diagnostic tools. Whilst these tools are being evaluated and implemented in the general population, there is the need to focus on special populations such as individuals with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) who have altered red blood cell morphology and atypical immune responses, which can obscure parasite detection. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of one of such tools, the National Library of Medicine (NLM) malaria screener app in people living with sickle cell disease in a malaria-endemic country, Ghana. A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted among SCD patients attending the Sickle Cell Clinic at Korle Bu Teaching Hospital in Accra, Ghana. Following informed consent, whole blood samples were collected and analyzed using the NLM malaria screener app, conventional microscopy, RDT, and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), with PCR as the reference standard. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of each diagnostic method were compared against PCR results. The NLM app identified the highest number of positive malaria cases, with 110 positive cases (36.2%), while both RDT and microscopy reported the highest number of negatives, with 287 negative cases (94.4%). Compared to PCR, the NLM app demonstrated a sensitivity of 89.5% and a specificity of 67.4%. RDT and microscopy displayed the same sensitivity as the NLM app, each achieving 89.5%. However, while RDT and microscopy had a specificity of 100%, the NLM app had a considerably lower specificity of 67.4%.The NLM malaria screener app shows promise as a preliminary screening tool for malaria in individuals with SCD. However, its lower specificity indicates a need for confirmatory testing to avoid potential overdiagnosis and mismanagement. Enhancements in the app's specificity could further support its utility in rapid and accessible malaria diagnosis for people with SCD, aiding in timely management and treatment."

By leveraging this technology, researchers can precisely cut, paste, and even rewrite DNA sequences within living cells. Nevertheless, the application of CRISPR screen technology goes far beyond mere experimentation. It serves as a pivotal tool in the fight against genetic diseases, systematically dissecting complex genetic landscapes, empowering researchers to unravel the molecular mechanisms underlying biological phenomena, and enabling scientists to identify and target the root causes of illnesses such as cancer, cystic fibrosis, and sickle cell anemia. Among all, cancer poses a formidable challenge for medicine, spurring eradication efforts. Radiotherapy, as a traditional treatment, yields results but has limitations. It eradicates cancer cells but also damages healthy tissues, causing adverse effects that reduce quality of life. Additionally, not all cancer cells respond to radiotherapy, and some may develop resistance, worsening the condition. To address this, a comprehensive whole-genome CRISPR screen technology is introduced, as it enables the efficient identification of radiosensitive and radioresistant genes, thereby advancing the field of cancer research and treatment. A genome-wide CRISPR screen was conducted in lung adenocarcinoma cells exposed to irradiation following the described protocol, through which both radioresistance- and radiosensitivity-associated genes were identified."

The clinical presentation and severity can be variable depending on many factors such as disease genotype, geographical location, environmental factors, and inheritance of other genetic abnormalities. The survival of patients with SCD have improved over last 3 decades where the expected median survival is more than 50 years for patients living in the developed countries. This improved survival is secondary to simple prophylactic and therapeutic interventions such as blood transfusions, prophylactic antibiotics, and vaccination. Disease modifying agents such as hydroxyurea contributed to the improved all disease outcome, survival, and quality of life. Over last 2 decades, curative options such as allogeneic stem cell transplant have gained popularity and increased evidence of safety and efficacy as the only curative option for SCD. However, there are many challenges to consider in patients who undergo hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) that may affect the outcome. In this chapter, multiple challenges will be discussed including the indications of HSCT, choosing the appropriate donor and how to prevent and manage the unique or common post-transplant complications. Elaborative sections will focus on conditioning regimens choices in matched related donor HSCT. In addition, challenges in regards to various approaches of alternative donor transplant will be thoroughly discussed. Finally, long term effects and recommended follow up will be described."

    "abstract": "Intrahepatic accumulation of cell-free hemoglobin (Hb) is a significant pathology linked with hemolytic disorders such as sickle cell disease (SCD). In addition to hepatic Kupffer cells, liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) were recently reported to contribute to Hb clearance in SCD mice and patients via currently unknown endocytic mechanism. Using small-molecule inhibitors of endocytic pathway components in primary human and mouse LSECs, we show that sickle-Hb (HbS) uptake by LSECs occurs predominantly through micropinocytosis or fluid-phase endocytosis. However, inhibiting clathrin-mediated endocytosis, receptor recycling, or drop in pH also significantly attenuated HbS uptake by LSECs. LSEC-driven HbS uptake was independent of haptoglobin. Finally, we found that the presence of lipid droplets promotes endothelial HbS internalization, whereas hypolipidemic condition inhibits it. In conclusion, this study identifies previously unknown alternative mechanism of LSEC-mediated HbS internalization. Our findings also inform the need to evaluate the therapeutic potential of blocking these mechanisms to ameliorate hemolysis-associated liver damage in SCD and other hemolytic disorders."

The management of SCD is complicated by limited healthcare infrastructure, a shortage of trained healthcare professionals, and widespread stigmatization. Public-private partnerships (PPPs) have emerged as a strategic solution to these challenges, leveraging the strengths of both the public and private sectors to improve access to care, enhance patient outcomes, and raise public awareness. This narrative review examines the role of PPPs in tackling SCD in Uganda, focusing on key areas such as health infrastructure development, capacity building for healthcare workers, and access to essential medications and treatments. The review highlights successful models of PPPs that have facilitated the establishment of specialized sickle cell clinics, the implementation of cost-effective screening programs, and community engagement initiatives aimed at reducing stigma and promoting early diagnosis. These partnerships have significantly contributed to improving the quality of care for individuals with SCD, particularly in high-prevalence regions."

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) remains a significant contributor to child mortality in Uganda, with an estimated 80% of children born with SCD dying before their fifth birthday, largely due to lack of early diagnosis and inadequate access to comprehensive care. Neonatal screening, although critical for early detection, is limited in Uganda, with coverage rates below 10%. This lack of early diagnosis often leads to delayed treatment and higher mortality rates. Data from recent studies highlight that implementing universal newborn screening could reduce SCD-related mortality by up to 50% if coupled with timely interventions such as prophylactic antibiotics, vaccination, and parental education. Comprehensive care, which includes regular health check-ups, preventive care, pain management, and access to blood transfusions, is essential for improving survival rates among children with SCD. However, in Uganda, only 30% of children with SCD receive regular follow-up care, and access to life-saving interventions like blood transfusions remains limited, especially in rural areas. A study conducted in Uganda found that children with SCD who received regular blood transfusions had a 70% lower risk of stroke and other severe complications compared to those who did not. Strengthening healthcare infrastructure and increasing access to these critical services are crucial to reducing mortality. Community engagement and education play a vital role in reducing SCD-related child mortality. Despite the high burden of SCD, awareness levels among Ugandan communities remain low, contributing to delayed healthcare-seeking behavior and high mortality rates."

Because of the similarities in the musculoskeletal, central nervous system, and renal manifestations in both diseases, diagnosis of SLE in patients with SCD can be difficult to establish. Both the SCD and sickle cell trait (SCT) can have a cumulative assault in the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD). We report a case of a 23-year-old female from an endemic region of SCD in Nepal who presented initially with the symptoms of urinary tract infection but was diagnosed later to have coexistent SCT with SLE. A biopsy of the kidney was done where evidence of lupus nephritis was found with no evidence of sickle cell nephropathy. She was managed with immunosuppressive medications. Although SCT and SLE are infrequently described combined, their related clinical characteristics, such as chronic progression and renal involvement, make identification more difficult. A renal biopsy is frequently necessary to distinguish between lupus nephritis, which is caused by autoimmune processes, and SCT-related kidney injury, which is associated with modest and localized sickling of red blood cells. Accurate identification of renal abnormalities is critical for guiding treatment and improving patient outcomes. Both SCT and SLE can have multisystem manifestations with positive anti-nuclear antibodies. The coexistence of both can accelerate the rate of kidney damage but isn't always the same as it may differ from case to case."

Pain from vaso-occlusive crises and hemolytic episodes was the main reason for analgesic use. Notably, 62% of homozygous patients were not receiving baseline treatment with hydroxycarbamide, increasing their risk of complications. Addressing this gap through pharmaceutical interventions was one of the study's key contributions. In conclusion, this research highlights the need for a multidisciplinary approach to optimize treatment and improve the quality of life of affected patients. Given its genetic significance, San Basilio de Palenque represents a unique setting for further studies on SCD."

    "title": "Total hip arthroplasty in sickle cell disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis of functional outcomes and complications.",
    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a significant risk factor for avascular necrosis (AVN) of the femoral head, often necessitating total hip arthroplasty (THA) at a younger age than patients with primary osteoarthritis. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the functional outcomes, surgical complications, and intraoperative blood loss in SCD patients undergoing THA. A systematic search of databases, including Cochrane, Web of Science, Scopus, EMBASE, and PubMed, was conducted on November 5, 2024. Studies involving sickle cell patients who underwent THA were included. Functional outcomes were assessed using scoring systems such as the Oxford Hip Score (OHS) and Harris Hip Score (HHS). Postoperative complications, revision rates, and intraoperative blood loss were also analyzed. Statistical analyses were conducted to derive pooled estimates and confidence intervals. PROSPERO ID: CRD42024609360. A total of 25 studies met the inclusion criteria, comprising both retrospective and prospective studies. The pooled analysis revealed a significant improvement in functional outcomes, with a mean HHS increase of 6.96 (95 % CI: 5.56-8.35). Mean age of patients ranged from 20 to 35 years. Pooled estimate of complications included aseptic loosening (12 %), dislocation (1 %), heterotopic ossification (8 %), iatrogenic fracture (8 %), infection (8 %), osteolysis (8 %), periprosthetic fractures (8 %), revision surgery (11 %), sickle cell crisis (5 %), and thromboembolism (2 %). The mean blood loss was 1059.24 ml. THA in sickle cell patients presents considerable challenges with a high risk of complications. Despite these challenges, THA can lead to functional improvement. Given the heightened risk profile, multidisciplinary perioperative care strategies are essential to optimize outcomes."

    "title": "Annual PM2.5 exposure and clinical, laboratory, and stroke-risk outcomes in pediatric sickle cell disease.",
    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) causes severe morbidity and early mortality, yet it varies phenotypically. Both air pollution and SCD affect the cardiorespiratory, inflammatory, and endothelial systems; however, limited evidence exists on the effect of long-term air pollution exposure in SCD. We hypothesized that annual ambient (outdoor) concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5), particles with a diameter of 2.5 μm or less, at a child's home would be significantly associated with worse clinical, laboratory, and stroke-risk imaging outcomes. Patient data for this retrospective study were obtained from a cohort of children with SCD (from 2010 to 2019). Annual PM2.5 exposure was estimated using remote-sensing air pollution datasets. Statistical analyses employed fixed effects multivariable models, offering a robust approach to isolate the effect of PM2.5 exposure. The final cohort included 1,089 children with SCD. Higher annual PM2.5 concentrations were significantly associated with more annual hospital days, higher likelihood of hospitalization and abnormal stroke-risk screening, and elevated inflammatory markers. Of note, hydroxyurea use mitigated the inflammatory response to PM2.5 but did not mitigate the effect of PM2.5 on clinical outcomes. Importantly, the elevated stroke risk associated with PM2.5 exposure persisted, even among children receiving hydroxyurea therapy, highlighting a critical concern in pediatric SCD management. These results underscore the clinical importance of addressing environmental factors for comprehensive SCD care."

She was treated with neoadjuvant trastuzumab-based chemotherapy, followed by a left-modified radical mastectomy and had residual invasive disease. She received postmastectomy radiation followed by adjuvant trastuzumab emtansine. Given the ER positivity, she also began adjuvant ovarian suppression (OS) and an aromatase inhibitor (AI). Throughout treatment, her SCD remained well-controlled, highlighting the potential for effective and tolerable cancer therapy in patients with SCD and the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration. This case underscores the importance of tailored oncological management and the need for further research on chemotherapy safety in this population."

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a chronic condition characterized by acute vaso-occlusive crisis (AVOC), which is the primary cause of emergency department (ED) visits for SCD patients. Despite recommendations for opioid use to manage AVOC pain, regional variations and biases in pain management persist, particularly in Saudi Arabia, where the prevalence of SCD varies by region. To identify national trends in pain management for AVOC in EDs across Saudi Arabia and analyze the duration and frequency of ED visits. A multicenter retrospective cohort study. Multiple acute care centers in Saudi Arabia under the Ministry of National Guard Health Affairs, including EDs and urgent care centers in Riyadh, Jeddah, Al-Ahsa, Dhahran, and Medina. A total of 421 SCD patients presenting with AVOC between 2016 and 2021 were included. Patients with other complications such as infections or acute chest syndrome were excluded. Data on patient demographics, ED visit frequency, length of stay, and medications administered were collected. The primary outcomes were the duration and frequency of ED visits and the types and frequency of analgesics administered. The study included 421 patients accounting for 20 508 ED visits. The average length of stay per ED visit was 4.7 hours. Morphine was the most frequently used opioid, administered to 86% of patients, while paracetamol was the most commonly used analgesic overall (93%). Regional differences were observed, with less opioid use in the Eastern region, where the disease is less severe due to haplotype variations. Ketamine was used in 13% of cases, predominantly in the Western region. The study highlights a diverse approach to AVOC management across Saudi Arabia, with variations influenced by regional differences and physician practices. Paracetamol and morphine were the primary analgesics, though disparities in opioid use suggest the need for standardized pain management protocols. This study was limited to centers under one organization and excluded patients with coexisting conditions, which may limit generalizability."

    "abstract": "African populations harbor the highest genetic diversity globally, shaped by over 300 000 years of adaptation to the continent's diverse ecology. Parasitic infections like malaria (Plasmodium falciparum) and sleeping sickness (Trypanosoma brucei) have driven genetic selection for resistance. For instance, the sickle-cell mutation (HBB:c.20A>T) offers malaria protection but causes sickle-cell disease. Similarly, APOL1 gene variants (G1/G2) protect against sleeping sickness but increase the risk of kidney disease. While these variants provide survival benefits, they also pose significant health challenges. This highlights the need for research into their effects on organ systems, epistasis, and potential therapies. Drugs targeting APOL1 synthesis are being tested to treat APOL1-mediated nephropathy, and exploring African genomes may uncover new parasite-resistant variants, advancing global genomic medicine."

    "abstract": "This qualitative study assessed the perceptions of caregivers of adolescents with sickle cell disease regarding fertility preservation consultation before stem cell transplant, through semistructured interviews. We interviewed 7 caregiver-adolescent dyads and 1 caregiver whose child didn't meet inclusion criteria due to age. Thematic analysis revealed 3 major inter-related themes: burden of sickle cell disease, decisional regret about reproductive choices, and hope that infertility would not impact them. Our study found that comprehension about the potential for infertility varied significantly, with a strong underlying hope that infertility will not impact them. Many of our caregivers and adolescents indicated decisional regret, suggesting they would now make a different choice about fertility preservation before transplant. Conversations and communication surrounding infertility in the setting of stem cell transplant is vital for our patients to understand the long-term impacts of curative therapy, to best ensure that their long-term quality of life goals will be met. Though the recent movement towards reduced intensity conditioning regimens in SCT may prove less gonadotoxic, fertility outcome data are not yet known. This study underscores the importance of effective communication during dedicated fertility consultations to help families make informed decisions for their children."

    "abstract": "Priapism is associated with hematologic disorders such as sickle cell disease and a rare adverse effect of psychotropic medications, including trazodone. While full-thickness penile gangrene is a rare but recognized complication of prolonged ischemic priapism, other cutaneous complications have not been described. We present an unprecedented case of a 40-year-old male who developed vesiculobullous necrosis with distinctive periurethral sparing following trazodone-induced priapism. The patient presented with a 15-hour priapism requiring surgical intervention with a modified proximal shunt, followed by the development of tense bullae on the penile shaft 48 hours after the procedure. We propose that this atypical morphology and distribution reflects distinctive features of the vascular anatomy of the penis, where the glans and periurethral tissues receive redundant blood supply from the terminal branches of the internal pudendal artery, while the shaft skin depends on superficial vessels vulnerable to compression during elevated intracavernosal pressures. The 48-hour delay between intervention and vesiculation is consistent with ischemia-reperfusion injury, a mechanism involving oxidative damage and inflammation triggered by the restoration of blood flow to ischemic tissues. This case represents a novel cutaneous manifestation of drug-induced priapism that clinicians should distinguish from other vesiculobullous disorders. Recognition of the characteristic distribution may permit clinical diagnosis without the need for biopsy, allowing for appropriate conservative management."

    "abstract": "Intimate partner violence (IPV) negatively impacts pregnant women and their unborn children. Globally, an estimated 19%, 9%, and 6% of women experience psychological, physical, and sexual IPV, respectively, during pregnancy. These rates are higher among pregnant women living with a stigmatizing disease. In this study, we examined the effect of antenatal screening for sickle cell disease (SCD) using the sickle cell solubility test on the risk of IPV among pregnant women in the city of Nagpur in Maharashtra state of India. We hypothesized that a positive solubility test increases the risk of IPV via partner disclosure. We conducted a cohort study comparing IPV in 182 pregnant women, before (baseline) and after (endline) having a solubility test. Of the 182 participants, 91 were pregnant women with a positive solubility test and 91 with a negative solubility test. We used the 49-item Indian Family Violence and Control Scale (<i>α</i> = 0.88) to measure IPV and estimated associations using binomial logistic regressions with robust standard errors. Pregnant women with a positive solubility test were at least twice as likely to experience physical, sexual, or psychological IPV as pregnant women with a negative solubility test, even after adjusting for baseline differences between these two groups on common IPV risk factors including the lower level of education and scheduled-caste membership. Pregnant women who have a positive solubility test are at risk of IPV after following routine instructions to disclose their test results to their male partners, so that they can undergo further testing to determine the baby's risk of SCD, sickle cell trait, or no risk. In resource-poor settings with high SCD prevalence, antenatal clinics are increasingly screening pregnant women to prevent mother-to-child transmission of SCD. There is a need to integrate strategies for women to disclose sickle cell screening test results and prevention of IPV caused by male partners."

The process of transitioning from pediatric to adult SCD health care systems can be disjointed and poorly coordinated, contributing to the high morbidity and mortality seen in this population. There is no universally accepted definition of a successful SCD care transition or existing standards and recommendations for SCD clinicians. The National Alliance of Sickle Cell Centers (NASCC) uses a described modified Delphi process to reach consensus among its members, through which we defined standards and recommendations for transitioning care from pediatric to adult care health systems, including the definition of successful transfer and integration into adult care and the essential health data elements needed for a standardized EHR transition note to facilitate clinician communication. NASCC members from pediatric, adult and lifespan SCD centers evaluated standards and recommendations for successful transfer and integration of care as well as pediatric and adult transition program operating practices. Consensus was achieved for 4 Standards and 14 Recommendations for transition of pediatric to adult care in SCD in the areas of transition policies, documents, tracking, definitions of successful transfer and transition of care, and initial visit responsibilities. This initiative defines two key elements of successful transition, which will allow for the study of interventions to improve outcomes. Importantly, these materials now provide the needed framework and quantifiable metrics for clinicians to evaluate their transition programs for quality improvement."

However, the safety and efficacy of a subsequent autologous HSC-based GT after graft failure with a previous allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) remains unclear. Some individuals who have experienced a failed first attempt at a potentially curative therapy might seek a second opportunity for cure via GT. In this article, we discuss various factors related to patient and HSC health that may influence feasibility, and shared decision making regarding whether an individual who has previously received an allogeneic HCT and experienced graft failure could consider an autologous GT. Exposure to chronic inflammatory stress and conditioning chemotherapy may compromise HSC fitness, reduce hematopoietic reserve, accelerate HSC aging, and promote the accumulation of deleterious genetic mutations, all of which may adversely affect the safety and efficacy of the GT."

    "abstract": "While mobile health (mHealth) apps have been made for various diseases, including sickle cell disease (SCD), most focus on a single purpose. SCD is a chronic disease that requires knowledge of the disease, self-management, and adherence to treatment plans. While mHealth apps have been made with single features for SCD, there is limited understanding of using an mHealth app with a more comprehensive set of features that could engage adults with SCD, depending on what features they prefer and need to engage and empower them in living with their disease. We evaluated the usage of an mHealth app with various features, including pain tracking, quizzes for patient-facing guidelines, pain and asthma action plans, and goal setting. Adults with SCD were enrolled at 2 sickle cell centers between 2018 and 2022 as part of a 6-month feasibility randomized controlled trial with participants completing surveys at baseline and 6 months. Participants were randomized into receiving either an mHealth app and booklet with patient-facing guidelines or a booklet with the guidelines alone. The mHealth app comprised web pages with patient-facing guideline material and a Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) project. The REDCap project included a personal profile, a pain tracker, goal setting, quizzes about the guidelines, and pain or asthma action plans. The REDCap project also included the ability to send daily text messages at a time they chose, which contained a message they could create and a link to their profile. Outcomes included SCD-specific knowledge and acute health care utilization (emergency room visits and hospitalizations). We evaluated the usage of these different features and relationships with baseline variables, each other, and study outcomes. Approximately 75% (50/67) of the enrolled and randomized participants completed all the study components, and 100% (26/26) of the participants who were randomized to the mHealth app arm and completed the study used the mHealth app. Further, 15/30 (50%) participants used multiple features. Baseline sickle cell knowledge and female gender were associated with more usage of pain diary (P=.04) and mission (P=.046) features, respectively. While not significant, mission completion was associated with lower hospitalizations (P=.06). Adults with SCD engaged differently with an mHealth app with multiple features. As this study was not focused on one part of our app, engagement with features in this app was entirely patient-driven, which may demonstrate the expected real-world use of an mHealth app in this population. A multipurpose app can help engage participants in self-management strategies through different features and potentially improve outcomes."

    "abstract": "Background Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a serious inherited disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. Zinc and magnesium are essential micronutrients involved in many cellular processes. Several studies have found that their deficiencies are common in SCD patients and may further complicate the disease. This study was conducted to examine plasma levels of zinc and magnesium in a group of SCD patients in Latakia. Methods A total of 85 SCD patients (52 males and 33 females) with both sickle cell anemia (HbSS) and hemoglobin sickle-beta-thalassemia (Hb S/β-Thal) genotypes at the steady state, and 30 healthy controls, were enrolled in this cross-sectional study with no age limits. Plasma zinc and magnesium levels were measured using colorimetric methods. Results Plasma zinc and magnesium levels were significantly lower in SCD patients compared to the controls (P < 0.05). Twelve SCD patients (14.1%) were zinc-deficient, and 37 (43%) had magnesium deficiency. Plasma zinc and magnesium levels were higher in HbSS patients than those with Hb S/β-Thal patients, but with no statistical significance (P > 0.05). Notably, all zinc-deficient SCD patients were < 16 years old. There was no significant (P > 0.05) difference in zinc deficiency distribution between males and females. Age and gender had no significant statistical relations with magnesium deficiency in SCD patients (P > 0.05). Conclusion This study has shown that plasma zinc and magnesium levels were significantly lower in SCD patients compared to the controls, with no significant difference between HbSS and Hb S/β-Thal genotypes. Zinc and magnesium administration may be required in SCD patients from an early age, especially zinc, to mitigate the adverse effects of their deficiencies."

Prompt pain medication and frequent pain assessments are recommended. Our SMART aim was to reduce the time from ED rooming to first analgesia administration for children presenting with SCD pain from 50 to less than 30 minutes by June 2024. Children presenting to the ED with a diagnosis of SCD requiring opioids for pain were included. The primary outcome was time from rooming to analgesia. A key driver diagram, developed by a multidisciplinary team, informed our interventions and then implemented through plan-do-study-act cycles. Statistical process control charts were used to analyze data with Nelson rules to detect special cause variation. Secondary measures included frequency of pain assessments in the first 2 hours and ED length of stay. From July 2020 to June 2024, there were 447 eligible encounters. Baseline data (n = 143) revealed an average time from ED rooming to analgesia of 50 minutes. Following interventions, including order set implementation, multidisciplinary collaboration, and incorporating the home action plan in the ED, special cause variation was detected with a centerline shift to 32 minutes. The median number of pain assessments in the first 2 hours of arrival improved from 2.2 to 2.7 with order set utilization. ED length of stay remained unchanged. Standardizing care with an order set increased the number of pain assessments. Incorporation of the SCD home pain action plan into the ED treatment pathway decreased the time to analgesia."

    "abstract": "<b>Background</b> Over the past six decades, advancements in medical care have significantly enhanced outcomes for individuals with sickle cell disease (SCD), with studies demonstrating increased survival rates into adulthood. A smooth transition from pediatric to adult care is essential for maintaining positive health outcomes. Nevertheless, healthcare systems have struggled to adapt, leaving gaps in support for the expanding adult SCD Population. Mulago Pediatric Sickle Cell Clinic has faced multiple challenges with the transition to adult care that are not well documented. The objective of this study was to describe the clinical characteristics of adolescents and adults with sickle cell disease and barriers to adult care at Mulago Hospital. <b>Methods</b> This was a mixed method cross-sectional study with both qualitative and quantitative data collection methods conducted among patients attending the pediatric sickle cell clinic at Mulago Hospital, their caregivers, and health care workers. A registry and medical records review was done to obtain data for the quantitative arm. The qualitative component consisted of 30 in-depth interviews involving patients and caregivers and 10 key informant interviews with healthcare workers. Quantitative data was coded and entered into Epidata version 4.6 and then exported to STATA 14 for analysis. Qualitative data was analyzed using the content thematic approach. <b>Results</b> The proportion of patients aged 14 years and above still attending the pediatric clinic was 21.6%. Barriers to the transition of care as expressed by caregivers and patients were limited knowledge of transition, attachment to their pediatric careers, and negative experiences in the adult clinics. Health care system barriers included poorly organized adult clinics with few working days compared to the pediatric clinic that operates daily. This was compounded by a lack of policies and guidelines on transition, inadequate human resources, and limited access to the essential drugs in the adult clinics. <b>Conclusions and recommendations</b> There is still a large proportion of adolescents and young adults still attending the pediatric sickle cell clinic and barriers to transition were not only sociodemographic but also psychosocial and health system related. There is a need for better planning and preparation with better patient-centred interventions to improve transition."

While the exact causes remain unclear, correlations with silent cerebral infarcts (SCIs) and abnormal perfusion and oxygenation have been reported in paediatric SCD populations. This study aimed to examine these associations in adults with SCD, including 70 severe SCD patients (HbSS & HbSβ<sup>0</sup>-thal), 22 mild SCD patients (HbSC & HbSβ<sup>+</sup>-thal), 16 thalassaemia patients and 29 healthy controls. We assessed seven neurocognitive domains: attention, working memory, processing speed, non-verbal IQ, verbal learning, visual memory and fine motor dexterity. Additionally, we analysed relationships between neurocognitive performance, SCIs, haemodynamics and oxygen metabolism parameters, including cerebral blood flow (CBF), oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO<sub>2</sub>). Our findings reveal that only processing speed was affected in SCD patients relative to norms, thalassaemia patients and controls. Fine motor dexterity was lower across all groups, possibly due to normative data not reflecting the transition from handwriting to typing. Notably, we found no correlation between neurocognitive performance, SCIs and perfusion and oxygenation parameters, suggesting that reduced processing speed may stem from other SCD-related factors, highlighting the need for further research."

    "abstract": "Chronic diseases such as sickle cell anaemia (SCA) often lead to catastrophic health expenditures, especially in malaria-endemic regions. There is limited evidence on the economic burden faced by households with children suffering from SCA. This study aimed to assess the household economic burden of SCA and the incidence of catastrophic health expenditures in Uganda and Malawi. This prospective cohort study was nested in a clinical trial comparing malaria chemoprevention regimes: weekly dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine versus monthly sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine for children aged 6 months to 15 years in Uganda and Malawi. The economic burden was evaluated using the cost of illness approach by measuring and valuing direct and indirect costs. Quantile regression models were employed to identify factors associated with these costs. The study included 723 children with an SCA (437 in Uganda and 286 in Malawi) with mean ages of 7.3 years (SD 3.9) and 8.0 years (SD 4.1), respectively. The annual median costs per household were $638.8 (IQR: $227-$2,693) in Uganda and $387.3 (IQR: $203-$694) in Malawi. The main contributors to the economic burden were direct costs in Uganda and indirect costs in Malawi. Factors such as malaria episodes, hospitalisation, hydroxyurea use, household wealth, children's age, and gender significantly influenced direct and indirect costs. The concentration indices (CI) revealed a pro-rich distribution with poorer households incurring higher direct costs in both Malawi, CI=-0.12 (SE = 0.00, P < 0.00), and Uganda, CI= -0.23 (SE = 0.02, P < 0.000). Most households in both countries experienced catastrophic health expenditures, with the highest incidence in the poorest quartile. Households with children with SCA incur high expenditures, which are catastrophic for a substantial proportion of them. Malaria episodes, hospitalisation and wealth status significantly increase the economic burden on households. Targeted interventions are needed to alleviate this financial strain, reduce disparities and improve outcomes for vulnerable households. Enhancing access to improved treatment strategies, such as effective malaria prevention measures and the consistent availability of hydroxyurea, could help reduce the number of sick episodes and, consequently, the economic burden on households and patients."

We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 557 patients with β-thalassemia followed from diagnosis for a median of 38 years. Predictive, survival, and regression analyses were used to determine the association between liver disease and potential risk factors. The crude incidence of liver disease was 26.4% (fibrosis/cirrhosis 24.2%, median age 34.4 years; hepatocellular carcinoma 2.3%, median age 45.4 years, 38.5% not preceded by cirrhosis). Among evaluated risk factors, only hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection (adjusted hazard ratio [HR]: 2.195, p < 0.001) and lifetime serum ferritin level (adjusted HR per 100-ng/mL increase: 1.030, p < 0.001) were significantly associated with liver disease, with a lifetime serum ferritin level > 1500 ng/mL being the best predictor (p = 0.001). Liver disease-free survival was significantly shorter in patients who had both versus either or neither risk factor (p < 0.001). Mostly severe and persistent but not mild-moderate or temporary/fluctuating elevation in liver enzymes was associated with liver disease development. Patients with β-thalassemia have a considerably increased lifetime risk of liver disease that is primarily driven by HCV infection and/or uncontrolled iron overload, especially in the 4th-5th decades of life."

Overall, 33 children with SCD and 33 healthy controls participated in this study. Serum YKL-40 concentrations of children with steady state SCD were significantly higher than the concentrations found in the healthy controls (median [Q1-Q3]: 71.0 [53.3-133.3] vs. 43.6 [37.9-69.9] ng/mL, p=0.001).

Surveys varied by participant group and inquired about organizational models and personal experiences of both providers and recipients of care. Across five sites, there was a total of 282 survey respondents: five leaders, nine frontline workers, 132 patients, and 136 caregivers. The most common diagnoses of PC patients were cancer, sickle cell disease, and HIV. Most sites reported sub-optimal administrative support (80%), hospital management support (60%), and building space (60%). Leadership responses highlighted variations in PC training requirements and opportunities. Frontline workers desired additional training, sponsorship, and governmental support. Most patients and their caregivers reported satisfaction with PC, though high levels of worry and hopelessness were reported. Increased organizational support appears necessary to facilitate improvements in administrative resources, staffing, and training. Emotional and spiritual wellbeing likely require prioritization when designing palliative care delivery services in Nigeria. Further research is needed to refine current services and inform implementation efforts."

    "title": "Transcranial Doppler Screening in Sickle Cell Disease: Insights from a Regional Study in Karnataka, India.",
    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD), a hereditary blood disorder in India, disproportionately affects Adivasi communities burdened by socio-economic and systemic inequities. Stroke, a severe complication of SCD, is underexplored in Indian populations, especially among Adivasi groups. This pilot study evaluated the feasibility of transcranial Doppler (TCD) screening in a peripheral healthcare setting in Karnataka, focusing on Adivasi SCD patients. Among 39 participants (27 HbSS, three HbSβ0, nine HbAS) from a hemoglobinopathy registry, none exhibited elevated time-averaged maximum mean (TAMM) velocities, but 73.3% of SCD patients showed unusually low middle cerebral artery (MCA) velocities (<70 cm/s). Significant differences in basilar artery (BA) flow velocities were noted between SCD and sickle cell trait (SCT) patients (p<0.05), while MCA parameters were comparable. The findings establish baseline TCD velocities and highlight the need for region-specific stroke prevention guidelines tailored to underserved Adivasi populations."

    "abstract": "Voxelotor (Oxbryta, GBT440) is a first-in-class drug, FDA-approved to treat sickle cell disease in 2019 but withdrawn from market in 2024. This drug acts as an allosteric modulator, designed to shift the equilibrium to the oxygenated R conformation. The drug was shown to both limit the accumulation of deoxygenated T-conformation sickle cell Hb fibers and increase Hb oxygen affinity. X-ray crystallography previously showed one-to-one Voxelotor binding stoichiometry for Hb, with the drug molecule bound to N-terminus of an alpha subunit. Here we use NMR spectroscopy to assess the structure of Voxelotor-bound hemoglobin in solution and mass spectrometry (MS) to determine stoichiometry and sites of binding. We find that the structure and stoichiometry of binding are far more heterogeneous than previously described. The addition of Voxelotor to R-conformation Hb induces an NMR signal found in the T-conformation of Hb. In addition, MS shows that the drug binds Hb at multiple sites, including the N-terminus of the beta subunit. The properties of Hb with Voxelotor bound at secondary sites have not been explored but should be considered at high doses. Heterogeneous binding should be assessed in other drugs of this class including GBT(021)601 currently in clinical trial."

In this retrospective single-centre study, 201 pregnancies from 145 individuals were assessed between 2000 and 2018 for the presence of a composite of immediate postpartum complications from admission during delivery to discharge, which included vaso-occlusive pain events, acute chest syndrome, infection (blood, urine, pulmonary) and/or new-onset hypoxia. Hypoxia was defined as SpO<sub>2</sub> below 92%. An immediate postpartum complication occurred in 74 pregnancies (37%), of which 97% experienced a vaso-occlusive pain event. No immediate postpartum deaths were recorded. Pregnancies with HbSS/HbSβ0 as compared to HbSC/HbSβ+ had a higher incidence of the composite outcome (51% vs. 19%). On univariate analysis, HbSS/HbSβ0 genotype was associated with a higher likelihood of developing a postpartum complication (OR 4.49, 95%CI 2.35-8.57; p < 0.0001); however, this significance was reduced on multivariable analysis. The strongest risk factors associated with experiencing the composite outcome on multivariable analysis were hypoxia during pregnancy (OR 4.95, 95%CI 1.86-13.23; p = 0.001) and an unscheduled caesarean delivery (OR 2.67; 95%CI 1.26-5.64; p = 0.01). Future studies need to address whether correcting hypoxia and use of predictive scores to guide the need for a scheduled caesarean delivery can reduce immediate postpartum complication rates."

The current survey aims to broaden our understanding of the burden of Sickle Cell Disease (SCD), highlights the experiences of healthcare providers (HCPs) and identify unmet needs from Southeast Asia. The survey was a cross-sectional quantitative study conducted by Ipsos UK on behalf of Pfizer. It involved a 12-minute online survey with HCPs from India, Malaysia, and Thailand if they were managing ≥ 3 patients with SCD for > 1 year. The survey covered aspects such as the impact of SCD on quality of life, treatment, and HCP knowledge and perceptions. The responses were collected either online or through face-to-face meetings. The survey link was accessed by 205 HCPs across the three countries. Of these, 105 (51.2%) HCPs were found to be eligible. A total of 85 (80.9%) HCPs completed the survey. Fatigue/tiredness and vaso-occlusive crisis (VOCs) pain were the most commonly stated symptoms by the patients. HCPs believed that SCD impacts long-term health consequences, self-esteem, and mental health. Hydroxyurea was reported to be the most commonly used treatment. The Financial impact of SCD on patients was reported by 78% HCPs. More HCPs in India consider the cost/benefit ratio to the patient and healthcare system before recommending a treatment. There is a need for greater recognition of the financial burden and impact on overall wellbeing of patients and their families. Surveyed HCPs are optimistic about using novel treatment options but need additional support for educating patients."

    "title": "Recombinase polymerase amplification for single nucleotide polymorphism-specific detection of β<sup>C</sup> variant in sickle cell disease.",
    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) comprises a group of inherited blood disorders caused by point mutations in the β-globin gene. SCD is characterized by at least one β<sup>S</sup> globin allele and a second pathologic globin variant that results in predominant formation of hemoglobin S (HbS). Early diagnosis in low-and middle-income countries is limited by the high cost and complexity of DNA-based tests. Recombinase Polymerase Amplification (RPA) is an isothermal nucleic acid amplification technique that facilitates rapid and low-cost detection of genetic mutations. While RPA primers have been developed to detect wild-type β<sup>A</sup> and β<sup>S</sup> alleles, they can also amplify the β<sup>C</sup> allele, the next most common hemoglobin variant causing SCD which requires distinct clinical management. We developed a novel allele-specific RPA fluorescent assay for selective detection of the β<sup>C</sup> allele using primers incorporating Amplification Refractory Mutation System (ARMS) and Locked Nucleic Acid (LNA) modifications. Twelve forward primers with different modifications were screened to achieve β<sup>C</sup>-specific amplification. The best-performing primer combined a single mismatch near the 3' end with an LNA at the terminal base, enabling specific detection of β<sup>C</sup> with a limit of detection of 100 copies per reaction. Key design insights include avoiding mismatches immediately before the LNA for consistent target amplification and positioning the LNA closer to the 3' end to achieve less sensitive amplification. This study establishes an isothermal assay for SCD diagnosis and offers systemic design strategies for SNP-specific RPA assays. These findings have important implications for expanding affordable, rapid genetic testing for hemoglobinopathies in low-resource settings."

    "abstract": "To correlate retinal imaging findings with systemic disease activity in children with sickle cell disease (SCD). A retrospective consecutive series. Children with SCD aged ≤18 years who had an ophthalmic examination at Boston Children's Hospital between January 1998 and August 2022 were included. Systemic findings included the number of hospitalizations, number of strokes, treatment with hydroxyurea, hemoglobin (Hgb), and fetal Hgb levels, and time-averaged mean velocity (TAMV) in the right middle cerebral artery (RMCA) and left middle cerebral artery (LMCA) on transcranial Doppler (TCD). Total retinal thickness was measured on macular OCT (Spectralis OCT2, Heidelberg Engineering). Vessel density (VD) of the superficial capillary plexus (SCP) and deep capillary plexus (DCP) and superficial foveal avascular zone area were measured on 6 × 6-mm OCT angiography (OCTA) scans. Six hundred six eyes from 303 pediatric SCD patients (53% males) were included. OCT and OCTA images were acquired on 104 (17.2%) and 60 (9.9%) eyes at presentation and on 159 (26.2%) and 100 (16.5%) eyes at the final visit, respectively. When adjusting for race and age, retinal thinning on OCT was associated with a higher frequency of hospitalizations, a higher frequency of strokes, and treatment with hydroxyurea. Retinal thickness in the inferior and temporal macula was positively correlated with TAMV in RMCA and in LMCA. Foveal retinal thickness was positively correlated with Hgb level. Similarly, reduced VD in the SCP and DCP in the inferior temporal macula correlated with a higher number of hospitalizations and strokes. A higher VD of the DCP in the inferior-temporal macula positively correlated with TAMV in RMCA (ρ = 0.328, <i>P</i> = 0.3) and in LMCA (ρ = 0.342, <i>P</i> = 0.029). A higher Hgb level correlated with a higher prevalence (ρ = 0.237, <i>P</i> = 0.037) and severity (ρ = 0.299, <i>P</i> = 0.008) of peripheral retinopathy in HbSC, while it correlated with lower prevalence (ρ = -0.183, <i>P</i> = 0.004) and severity (ρ = -0.185, <i>P</i> = 0.004) of peripheral retinopathy in HbSS genotypes. Visual acuity did not correlate with TCD velocity, Hgb level, or number of hospitalizations in HbSS or HbSC genotypes. OCT and OCTA findings are correlated with the severity of systemic disease in children with SCD. Imaging parameters were better correlated with key outcomes such as stroke and hospitalizations than visual acuity. The results suggest that quantitative measures on retinal imaging could be used as biomarkers to predict systemic disease risk and activity.

    "abstract": "HbD-Punjab is prevalent in the north-western region of India with an estimated frequency of 2% in Punjab. The association of HbD-Punjab with HbS results in moderate-severe symptoms which are similar to the HbSS homozygous phenotype. Simultaneous presence of variant HbD with HbS favors polymerization of HbS molecules which results in serious consequences like sickle vaso-occlusion leading to diminished flow of blood through the capillaries supplying the bones resulting in ischemia, avascular necrosis, infarcts of bone, untimely closure of epiphyseal plates and stunted growth. This study describes a brief incident where a 28-year-old female, who presented with left sided hip pain, diagnosed with left hip femoral head Avascular Necrosis (AVN) (Grade-3). She was diagnosed with sickle cell anemia in a regional hospital at the age of six years and had undergone multiple blood transfusions. She had a history of right total hip replacement, left knee synovectomy and pain in multiple joints, including both the knees, elbows and shoulders. In view of severe anemia, hemoglobin fractionation was done using HPLC method which was suggestive of double heterozygous Hb SD-Punjab, genetic and family studies were recommended and there was no significant family history. This study enlightens the occurrence of adverse consequences in the presence of a double heterozygous Hb variant with one of the variants being Hb S. Laboratory investigations for identification and characterization of such variant hemoglobin is important for preventive and palliative care."

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a complex hemoglobinopathy. Vaso-occlusive episodes are the primary cause of emergency department (ED) utilization among individuals with SCD. Literature lacks a standardized definition for high ED utilization. To explore ED utilization, redefine high ED utilization, and describe factors associated with super-high ED utilization among individuals with SCD. This retrospective cohort study analyzed the North Carolina Hospital Discharge Datasets (2013-2019). Participants were included if they had SCD, defined as at least 3 SCD visits (ED, inpatient, or outpatient surgery) in a rolling 5-year period. All age groups, sexes, and payers, regardless of state of residence, were included. Data were analyzed from July 2023 to August 2024. Variables included sex, race, ethnicity, age, age at death, distance (in miles) to the closest SCD center, number of annual ED visits, and social vulnerability index (SVI). To determine ED utilization categories, first the distribution of people based on the number of annual ED visits was examined, then the categories across years were identified to determine the data-informed cutoff for each category. Univariate analysis determined differences between participants based on the ED utilization category using χ2 tests of independence or analysis of variance, as applicable. Descriptive statistics were conducted to describe characteristics of utilization in the sample and by ED utilization group. A parsimonious multinomial regression was conducted using significant factors from the univariate analysis. The cohort included 9964 unique patients (5364 [53.83%] female; mean [SD] age, 24.49 [17.54] years), including 9355 Black patients (93.89%), with 100 188 total ED visits from 2013 to 2019. ED visits were categorized into 4 levels: low (0-1 visits per year), moderate (2-9 visits per year), high (10-32 visits per year), and super high (≥33 visits per year). A small subset (178 patients [1.79%]) exhibited super-high ED utilization, contributing disproportionately to the total number of ED visits. Older age, younger age for in-facility deaths, and higher SVI were significantly associated with higher ED utilization. Patients with high utilization were more likely to die, die younger (eg, median [IQR] age at death, 33.0 [30.0-44.0] years in the super-high utilization group vs 50 [38.0-61.0] years in the moderate utilization group), use multiple EDs (eg, 93.8% of participants in the super-high utilization group vs 40.08% of participants in the moderate utilization group), and reside in counties more disadvantaged on socioeconomic and transportation characteristics. This cohort study of 7 years of North Carolina Hospital Discharge Data described 4 new categories of ED utilization in SCD. These categories could be used to reframe how high ED use is determined."

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a major global health burden with significant clinical, social, and economic impacts. Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) is an underreported complication of SCD that is, primarily attributed to vaso-occlusive crises and ischemia. This condition adversely affects the quality of life, education, and social integration, particularly among children in resource-limited settings. Understanding the risk factors for SNHL is crucial for prevention, early detection, and timely intervention. This study evaluated the prevalence of SNHL in children with SCD and identified associated risk factors. This prospective comparative study was conducted at a tertiary healthcare facility in Northwest Nigeria. A total of 250 children aged 5-16 years were enrolled, comprising 125 patients with confirmed sickle cell disease (SCD) in a steady state and 125 age- and sex-matched controls with a normal haemoglobin genotype (HbAA). Bilateral SNHL was identified in 25.6% of SCD cases, whereas no SNHL was observed in the control group. The male-to-female ratio among the affected children was 1.2:1. Multivariate logistic regression revealed significant associations between SNHL and elevated white blood cell count (Odds Ratio {OR} 1.035; 95% Confidence Interval {CI} 1.020-1.050), elevated platelet count (OR 1.209; 95% CI 1.070-1.365), poor clinic attendance (OR 28.668; 95% CI 4.879-168.458; <i>P</i>= < 0.001), non-compliance with SCD medications (OR 9.634; 95% CI 1.830-50.718; <i>P</i> = 0.008), and frequent severe sickle cell crises requiring hospitalization (OR 2.106,; 95% CI 0.019-0.598; <i>P</i> = 0.001). This study highlights the high prevalence of SNHL in children with SCD and its association with modifiable risk factors. Routine audiological screening, consistent clinic attendance, medication adherence, and regular monitoring of haematological parameters are essential for early identification and management of SNHL. Targeted interventions can significantly improve the outcomes and reduce the burden of this debilitating complication."

The disease is the leading cause of complications, emphasizing the urgent need for effective preventive strategies and diagnostic protocols. We evaluated the implementation and effectiveness of infection prevention measures and laboratory diagnostic compliance at Nyamagana District Hospital, emphasizing their effects on patient outcomes and survival rates. This retrospective observational study analyzed the medical records of 157 patients with SCD admitted to Nyamagana District Hospital for infection treatment between January 2022 and 2024. The infection profiles, utilization of preventive interventions (recommended drugs, vaccinations, and chemoprophylaxis), and diagnostic laboratory compliance were assessed. Of the 157 participants, 90.4% had at least one infection during their hospital stay, suggesting the vulnerability of this population to infections. Furthermore, malaria emerged as the most prevalent type of infection (40.1%), which is consistent with its endemic status in Tanzania. Other significant infections included unspecified diarrhea (12.5%) and upper respiratory tract infections (10.8%). Despite the high coverage rates of penicillin V prophylaxis (72%) and pneumococcal vaccination (100%), the utilization of malaria chemoprophylaxis and hydroxyurea was low (only 10.8% and 16.6%, respectively). The diagnostic laboratory test compliance, essential for accurate infection management, was moderate at 63.1%, with significant deficiencies in the blood, urine, and stool cultures and antibiotic susceptibility testing. The administration of hydroxyurea significantly reduced malaria prevalence (P=0.005), fewer vaso-occlusive crises (P<0.001), and severe anemia incidence (P=0.034). Thus, enhancing access to preventive measures and improving diagnostic laboratory compliance are crucial steps for reducing infection-related complications among patients with SCD in Nyamagana."

We report the case of a 39-year-old African primigravida at 36 weeks of gestation who presented with a 1-week history of heart failure symptoms. Her antenatal course was largely uneventful apart from severe anemia, for which she was transfused 2 units of whole blood followed by prescription of hematinics. Laboratory investigations revealed hemolytic anemia, a positive sickling test, and confirmatory hemoglobin electrophoresis demonstrating 93% sickle hemoglobin and 4.1% hemoglobin fetal, establishing a new diagnosis of homozygous SCD. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed a severely reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF 26%) and dilated left heart chambers, consistent with a diagnosis of PPCM. She was admitted to the maternity intensive care unit and managed by a multidisciplinary team, with stabilization on supportive therapy. At 38 weeks, she underwent a successful elective cesarean section, followed by an uneventful postpartum recovery. She was discharged 9 days postpartum in a stable condition (New York Heart Association Class II) on guideline-directed medical therapy and enrolled in outpatient follow-up. At 6 months, follow-up echocardiography showed partial recovery of cardiac function with an LVEF of 38%. She continues to be monitored by cardiology and hematology teams. This case highlights the critical importance of considering underlying hemoglobinopathies in pregnant patients presenting with unexplained heart failure, especially in regions where SCD is endemic."

The hallmark of SCD is acute and chronic pain, which leads to increased healthcare utilization. Pain in SCD is treated with full opioid agonists with variable effectiveness. There is growing evidence supporting buprenorphine in adults with SCD for pain. The objective of this study was to describe the health outcomes of buprenorphine use in adults with SCD. This study was a single-center, retrospective cohort study of all individuals with SCD and chronic pain treated with buprenorphine between November 2020 and January 2024. Descriptive statistics and paired t-tests were used to compare health outcomes before and after treatment. Thirteen inductions were completed, six using telemedicine, two with a diagnosis of opioid use disorder, one individual (7.7%) failed induction and did not continue buprenorphine. Median duration of follow-up was 103 days (range 21-1,497 days). Buprenorphine use was associated with lower annualized rates of emergency department visits (7.2 vs 5.9, -1.3, p < .001), hospital admissions (8.5 vs 5.6, -2.9, p < .001), and treatment center visits (3.0 vs 2.2, -0.9, p < .001), and lower rates of home opioid use (189.3 vs 35.6 morphine milligram equivalent, -153.7, p < .001). Buprenorphine induction was successful using telemedicine and for those with opioid use disorder.

    "abstract": "SCD is a family of genetic blood disorders that affects over 20 million people worldwide. SCD complications include pain, anemia, and early death. The hallmark cause of medical visits for people with SCD is pain, initially in the form of acute, severe, vaso-occlusive crises stemming from obstructed blood vessels and a plethora of underlying disordered biological mechanisms. Vaso-occlusive crises are unpredictable and are often associated with acute disability and/or hospitalization. Both vaso-occlusive crises and longer-term, chronic sickle cell pain can contribute to multi-system organ damage and eventually early death. Many of the disordered biological mechanisms of SCD, and how they relate to painful outcomes, are not well understood. Mathematical modeling can be a useful tool to study and analyze such disordered SCD biological phenomena: biodynamics, vaso-occlusion, and responses to SCD drug and gene therapy. In this review, we summarize the variety of mathematical modeling methods used to study SCD and provide specific examples of how mathematical modeling contributes new understandings of SCD."

Social, economic, and political factors in East and Central Africa were described. A total of 37 publications were categorized into four themes: morbidity and mortality of SCA in sub-Saharan Africa; TCD screening for risk of primary stroke in children; treatment of children with SCA in resource-limited settings; and approaches to capacity gaps. SCA represents a public health problem in sub-Saharan Africa. TCD screening with hydroxyurea treatment can improve outcomes and prevent primary stroke. Multiple barriers exist, including limited diagnostic screening, inconsistent availability of and access to hydroxyurea, and knowledge gaps. These barriers are influenced by social, economic and policy factors that can be addressed to build capacity and improve outcomes."

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is one of the most common hereditary diseases in the world. It leads to hemolytic anemia and painful vaso-occlusive crises that can damage target organs at the cardiopulmonary, cerebrovascular, and renal levels. SCD has also significant consequences on reproductive functions and fertility. Moreover, the treatments designed to alleviate and reduce vaso-occlusive crises directly impact male reproductive functions. Nevertheless, literature assessing the impact of SCD and its treatments on male reproductive functions remains limited and lacks robust evidence. A systematic review of the literature following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) recommendation was carried out on the reproductive functions of men with SCD and the reproductive options available to them. Most studies have found that men with SCD frequently exhibit impaired sperm parameters. In addition, hydroxyurea (HU), proposed to relieve and reduce vaso-occlusive crises, is also known to impact male reproductive functions, and the reversibility of these consequences on sperm parameters remains hypothetical. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is currently the only curative treatment. However, conditioning treatments are highly gonadotoxic and can permanently alter spermatogenesis. Young men with SCD should therefore be informed about fertility at an early stage, and fertility preservation should be discussed in pubescent men, especially if treatment with HU or HSCT is to be initiated. In prepubertal boys about to undergo HSCT, immature testicular tissue freezing should be discussed, even though this technique is still experimental."

A structured coaching model was used, involving one-on-one training sessions, competency assessments, and collaboration with the hematology department to facilitate patient cases for practice. Progress was measured using surveys and control charts. Over the 32-month period of this project, the percentage of TCD-competent sonographers increased from 21 to 58%, and reliance on a single expert technologist for TCD exams decreased from 42 to 3%. Additionally, the percentage of SCD patients receiving TCD screening rose from 87 to 91%. The implementation of a coaching model significantly improved the number of trained TCD technologists and enhanced screening rates for SCD patients."

The assessment covered the following areas: patient referral, vaso-occlusive crisis, acute chest syndrome, transfusion therapy, and priapism. The patient referral category included guidelines for admission to intensive care unit and management at specialized reference centers. The vaso-occlusive crisis topic encompassed pain management, hydration, incentive spirometry, and target oxygen saturation levels. For acute chest syndrome, the focus areas included imaging techniques such as lung ultrasound, computed tomography scans, and echocardiography; treatment with systemic corticosteroids; non-invasive ventilation; prophylactic and therapeutic anticoagulation; and procalcitonin and antibiotic therapy. The section on transfusion therapy addressed indications and methods of transfusion, as well as the diagnosis and prediction of delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions. A total of 45 recommendations were proposed, including 14 specific to adults, 13 specific to pediatrics, and 18 applicable to both adults and children, along with three therapeutic algorithms. The Grade of Recommendation Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was adhered to throughout the process. Sixteen recommendations were based on a low level of evidence (GRADE 2+ or 2-), while 26 were based on evidence that could not be classified under the GRADE system and were therefore considered expert opinions. Finally, for three aspects of sickle cell disease management, the experts concluded that no reliable recommendations could be made based on the current state of knowledge. The recommendations and therapeutic algorithms received strong agreement from the experts."

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a chronic genetic disorder that has significant psychosocial consequences for both patients and their families. This study aimed to investigate family functioning and the psychosocial burden experienced by caregivers of children with SCD. This descriptive, cross-sectional study involved 170 caregivers of children with SCD, selected through systematic random sampling. Data were collected using both structured and semi-structured questionnaires. Family functioning was assessed using the Family APGAR (Adaptation, Partnership, Growth, Affectation, Resolve) while the psychosocial burden was evaluated using the Sickle Cell Disease Burden Instrument (SCDBI). Statistical analysis was performed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 24. The mean age of the participants was 34.7 years, and 83% were female. The majority of caregivers reported a high level of family functioning. However, significant psychosocial burden was observed in areas such as finances, disruption of routine family activities, and the caregivers' coping abilities. The impact on family interactions was minimal. Most caregivers in this study demonstrated good family functioning. Although caring for a child with sickle cell disease imposed a significant psychosocial burden, the negative impact on family interactions was minimal."

    "title": "The phenotypes of sickle cell disease: strategies to aid the identification of undiagnosed patients in the Italian landscape.",
    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited autosomal recessive monogenic blood disorder characterized by red blood cell sickling responsible for recurrent vaso-occlusive crises and chronic hemolysis. Clinical manifestations vary and SCD patients experience increased morbidity and mortality. In Italy, SCD patients cluster into two distinct subpopulations: those of sub-Saharan African descent and those of Caucasian descent. Most sub-Saharan African SCD patients are children or young adults and carry the homozygous genotype hemoglobin (Hb) S, or SC, whereas Caucasian SCD patients tend to be older and have predominantly HbS/β-thalassemia. Patients of African descent typically present with acute SCD-related events, including vaso-occlusive crises, acute chest syndrome, anemia, fever, and pneumonia. Caucasian patients, according to the different distribution of SCD genotypes, may exhibit either acute episodes or chronic long-term complications. Regardless of age, genotype, or ethnic background, most SCD patients in Italy are undiagnosed, and pain, fatigue and anemia should be regarded as presenting signs and symptoms of this disease. The tests needed to diagnose SCD are simple, and a complete blood count together with erythrocyte morphology, wherever available, hemolysis markers, should be performed whenever SCD is suspected. If a patient presents with two risk factors -family history, ethnicity, or a significant clinical feature - a first-level screening test (e.g. assessment of Hb fractions with HPLC), where available, should be performed immediately, or a referral should be provided. Here, we present an overview of the clinical features of SCD that may be encountered in real-world clinical practice in Italy from a practical perspective. This narrative review may aid non-specialist physicians in identifying disparate clinical conditions that may be symptoms or signs of SCD."

    "abstract": "In the present review, simple approaches for the screening and characterization of natural compound agents that alter pro-inflammatory gene expression are described, with a particular focus on aged garlic extract (AGE), which has been the subject of several investigations that have supported its potential application as an anti-inflammatory agent. Additionally, evidence regarding the possible effects and mechanisms of action of two major AGE components, S-allyl cysteine (SAC) and S-1-propenyl-l-cysteine (S1PC), is reviewed. The proposed molecular targets of SAC and S1PC are IKKβ kinase, the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1-nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 complex, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ, histone deacetylase and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). Targeting these molecules causes a marked reduction in NF-κB activity accompanied by a notable decrease in the transcription of NF-κB-regulated genes. Another main objective of the present review was to discuss the possibility that AGE and its bioactive components could be employed in the treatment of several human pathologies that are characterized by a hyperinflammatory state resulting from dysregulation of the TLR4 and NF-κB pathways. SAC is of interest in the treatment of lung pathologies, neurological diseases, osteoarthritis, muscular atrophy, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and cancer. Additionally, the anti-oxidative activities of AGE, SAC and S1PC are compatible with their employment in the treatment of diseases characterized by oxidative stress, such as sickle cell disease and β-thalassemia."

Retrospective study in pediatric patients who self-identified as African American with SCD treated at Phoenix Children's between 2014 and 2021. Associations of asthma controller medications with changes in lung symptoms (cough, wheeze, chest pain, shortness of breath with exercise, sleep disturbance), Acute Chest Syndrome (ACS), and percent predicted probabilities (FEV<sub>1</sub>, FVC, FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC, FEF<sub>25%-75%)</sub>) were examined (Fisher exact, Wilcoxon rank sum) in SCD patients overall, and by physician-diagnosed asthma. Of the total 98 SCD patients, 28 (29%) had an asthma diagnosis and 76 (78%) were treatment naïve. During study follow-up, asthma controller medications were used by 57 (58%) patients (35 new prescriptions, 13 continued prescriptions and 9 with prescription escalation), with 41 patients remaining treatment naïve. Medication use vs non-use during follow-up improved cough (33% vs 7%, p = 0.002), chest pain (12% vs 5%, p = 0.03) and shortness of breath with exercise (32% vs 10%, p = 0.01) among all SCD patients. Medications also improved the mean relative percent change FEV<sub>1</sub> (12.3 vs -3.6; p < 0.0001), FVC (10.5 vs -1.3; p < 0.0001), and FEF<sub>25%-75%</sub>, (20.6 vs -8.8; p < 0.0001), overall and in both asthmatics and non-asthmatics. These findings demonstrate improved lung function and respiratory symptoms with asthma controller medications in pediatric patients with SCD, irrespective of an asthma diagnosis, and hold great promise for this undertreated population."

Spirometry is utilized in monitoring lung health. Recently, the American Thoracic Society recommended the use of race-neutral predictive equations. We aimed to evaluate how the use of race-neutral equations may affect spirometry results and interpretation in children with SCD. This retrospective study included children aged 5-21 years with SCD followed at Arkansas Children's Hospital (01/01/2000-06/30/2023) who had completed at least one spirometry. Percent predictive (pp) and z-score values were calculated using race-adjusted and race-neutral predictive equations. Absolute and relative differences were calculated. Percent of subjects with forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV<sub>1</sub>) and forced vital capacity (FVC) with z-score <-1.645 and pp < 80%, and FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC z-score < -1.645 were compared. Severity of impairment based on z-score was compared. One hundred children completed 460 spirometries. Transitioning from race-adjusted to race-neutral equations resulted in [mean (SD)]: a decrease in ppFEV<sub>1</sub> [-9.497% (2.8344)], FEV<sub>1</sub> z-score [-0.723 (0.2286)], ppFVC [-10.08% (3.3440)], FVC z-score [-0.750 (0.2757)], FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC z-score [-0.057 (0.05461)], and an increase in ppFEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC [0.2785 (0.3921)]. Transitioning from race-adjusted to race-neutral equations resulted in an increase of impairment for FVC and FEV<sub>1</sub> and a threefold increase in subjects with abnormal values. Adoption of race-neutral reference equations resulted in a decrease in FEV<sub>1</sub> and FVC values (z-scores and percent predicted) and an increase in severity of impairment."

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a common genetic disorder affecting up to 2.6% of the population in Saudi Arabia. SCD results in severe disability, reduced quality of life, extensive use of medical resources, increased economic burden, and a high likelihood of increased mortality. Red blood cell transfusion remains a cornerstone in the management of SCD complications. This position paper highlights the current state of SCD management within the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Despite the advantages of automated red blood cell exchange (aRBCX) and guideline recommendations, its use remains limited. In practice, aRBCX is used for a variety of indications, including acute management and prophylaxis of stroke, systemic fat embolism, severe forms of acute chest syndrome, preoperative management, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, hepatic crisis, and priapism. However, aRBCX is underutilized in pregnancy. Common gaps identified by the advisory panel include the absence of standardized national guidelines, limited access to aRBCX, issues with vascular access, lack of equipment, and insufficient staff training. Another limitation to the use of aRBCX is the higher blood requirements compared to other blood transfusion modalities. These factors contribute to geographical disparities in the management of SCD and suboptimal patient outcomes. To address these issues, the advisory panel recommended developing and implementing evidence-based national guidelines, expanding access to aRBCX, enhancing health staff education and training, and establishing a robust national SCD registry. By prioritizing these recommendations, we can help streamline SCD care, reduce practice variation, and nationalize sickle cell disease management in Saudi Arabia to improve patient care."

    "abstract": "<b>Background/Objectives</b>: Despite the high incidence of sickle cell anemia in Saudi Arabia, little is known about the sociodemographic characteristics, behavioral risk factors, and concomitant conditions of the condition. We performed this study to measure the prevalence of sickle cell anemia and its associated predictors among Saudi residents. <b>Methods</b>: This cross-sectional study was conducted in 48 primary healthcare centers across Saudi Arabia. A total of 14,239 Saudi residents were included through multi-stage random sampling. Data on sociodemographic variables, behavioral factors, and comorbidities were collected using a validated and reliable questionnaire. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the predictors of sickle cell anemia, with the statistical significance set at a <i>p</i>-value of <0.05. All analyses were carried out using SPSS version 26 for Windows. <b>Results</b>: Overall, the prevalence of sickle cell anemia was found to be 3.2% among Saudi residents. There was a positive association between insurance coverage and sickle cell anemia (AOR: 1.87; 95% CI: 1.52, 2.31). The odds of sickle cell anemia were 1.39 times higher among diabetic than non-diabetic individuals (AOR: 1.39; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.91). There were positive associations between sickle cell anemia and hypertension (AOR: 1.70; 95% CI: 1.23, 2.35), high cholesterol (AOR: 2.38; 95% CI: 1.74, 3.24), and heart disease (AOR: 8.05; 95% CI: 6.05, 10.71). <b>Conclusions</b>: Our findings indicate significant associations between sickle cell anemia and insurance coverage, smoking, obesity, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and heart disease. While the overall prevalence of sickle cell anemia in our study was relatively modest, the Saudi Arabian government should prioritize the objective quantification of the disease burden across the population to effectively mitigate its consequences."

    "abstract": "Variability in blood donors, components, and recipients are known to affect transfusion outcomes, yet the combined effects of these factors remains unclear. The Red Blood Cell - Improving Transfusions for Chronically Transfused Recipients (RBC-IMPACT) study was a multi-center longitudinal study conducted in the United States (US) and Brazil over two years to investigate RBC survival after transfusion (Aim 1) and acute increase in iron post transfusion (Aim 2) (see https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05255445). The US RBC-IMPACT study included patients with thalassemia and sickle cell disease (SCD) and, in Aim 2 only, children with hematology-oncology diseases with a hypoproliferative bone marrow. In Brazil, the study was conducted within an established SCD cohort. Blood samples were collected immediately before and after RBC transfusion to measure hemoglobin (Hb), hemoglobin A (HbA) in SCD, and markers of iron and hemolysis. Samples were collected two hours post transfusion in a subset of participants receiving primarily single unit transfusions for Aim 2. Transfusate samples were collected from transfused units. Single nucleotide polymorphism array typing of donors and recipients to measure genetic variants including those associated with increased in vitro hemolysis of stored RBCs was conducted. Comprehensive information regarding donors, components and some recipient data were linked to key clinical data extracted from recipients' medical records to assess factors associated with RBC transfusion effectiveness. The outcomes for Aim 1 were RBC survival between successive transfusions, calculated as ΔHbA per day for SCD and by ΔHb per day for thalassemia, and Δbilirubin for both patient groups. The primary outcome for Aim 2 was change in serum iron from before to 2 hours after transfusion. This study will be the most detailed and granular evaluation of the predictive variables that may optimize RBC effectiveness and safety in these chronically transfused patient populations."

The data were collected over a period of 9 years, from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2022. We recorded 858 emergency department visits related to sickle cell disease out of a total of 135,000 pediatric emergency department visits, giving a prevalence of 6.4 per 1000 children aged up to 18 years. The median age was 12 years (8-16) years. The average waiting time in the emergency department for children with sickle cell disease was 2 h (±1) in 2014 and 45 min (±15) in 2022. Children with sickle cell anemia were more likely than others to have been seen by a consultant in an emergency department. The most commonly associated pathology was asthma, with a frequency of 17%. The risk factors for hospitalization were an age between 5 and 10 years and a severe form of sickle cell disease. The treatment of pain and fever were often delayed. This leads us to suggest that systematic prior communication between the pediatric hematologist and the emergency physician is crucial. However, there is a need to define best practices for the management of children with sickle cell disease presenting to the emergency department with a fever."

Chronic transfusion therapy has been established for primary and secondary prevention of CVA in SCD, resulting in a notable reduction in CVA incidence. For individuals with SCD presenting with CVA, the impact of acute management on neurological outcomes is not well studied. Herein, we examine the neurological outcomes of 29 children and adults with SCD who received acute red cell exchange (RCE) as primary therapy for neurological events at a single institution. Twelve (41%) individuals had a prior history of CVA, and 12 (41%) were on chronic transfusions. Among 13 adults, 3 (23%) had a history of diabetes and 4 (31%) had a history of hypertension. One adult (7.7%) received thrombolytic therapy; the remainder were ineligible due to age, timing of presentation, intracranial haemorrhage or transient symptoms. Higher post-RCE haematocrit was associated with decreased odds of death or persistent neurological symptoms at hospital discharge (OR 0.69, 95% CI: 0.45-0.94, p = 0.017). Optimal acute management of adults living with SCD presenting with CVA remains an understudied yet important topic.

The aim of this review is to provide an overview and synthesis of available data to improve understanding of the impact sleep disruption and SDB have on neurologic and neurocognitive complications in children with SCD. We conducted a comprehensive literature search across databases including Medline, PubMed, and Cochrane from inception to March 2023. Studies assessing neurologic outcomes (e.g., stroke, silent cerebral infarcts) or cognitive function in children with SCD in relation to SDB were included. A total of 542 studies were screened, with 21 meeting inclusion criteria. SDB was associated with adverse neurologic outcomes, including increased stroke risk, higher transcranial Doppler velocities, and cerebral vasculopathy. Neurocognitive deficits, including reduced IQ, verbal comprehension, and executive function, were linked to nocturnal hypoxemia and fragmented sleep. Treatment interventions such as adenotonsillectomy and positive airway pressure improved sleep quality and mitigated neurocognitive deficits. SDB exacerbates the neurologic burden in children with SCD through pathways involving hypoxia, oxidative stress, and inflammation. Screening and timely intervention for sleep disorders in this population are crucial to improving neurologic and cognitive outcomes."

Using GRACE, we recalibrated a recent health technology assessment in sickle cell disease for 2 gene therapies, lovo-cel and exa-cel. The GRACE framework modified existing CEA by adjusting willingness-to-pay thresholds based on untreated illness severity, incorporating treatment outcome uncertainty, and varying the substitution rates between life expectancy and QoL across health states. Implementing the GRACE framework resulted in a 6% reduction in both direct and societal incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for lovo-cel and exa-cel, demonstrating a decrease from $192 651 and $161 816 to $182 036 and $152 900 per quality-adjusted life year, respectively. Additionally, willingness-to-pay thresholds increased by approximately 50%, reflecting a higher valuation of treatments under GRACE. GRACE-adjusted estimates suggest that lovo-cel and exa-cel are cost-effective from both direct payer and societal perspectives. The GRACE method offers a more comprehensive and precise estimation of societal value, leading to more efficient and equitable resource allocation. This study not only highlights the limitations of traditional CEA in capturing the total societal value of treatments for severe diseases but also provides a roadmap for incorporating GRACE model elements into health technology assessments, thereby facilitating a broader acceptance of innovative therapies that significantly enhance patient QoL."

Data analysis was performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 25. Comparative statistical analyses, binary logistic regression, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve evaluations were performed to determine the predictive value of PNR for risk of SCD complications. Patients with avascular necrosis (AVN) had significantly lower median PNR values compared to those without the condition (151.0 IQR: 311.2 vs. 77.5 IQR: 61.0, p = 0.004). Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified PNR as an independent predictor of AVN (p = 0.034, OR = 1.003, 95% CI: 1.000-1.006), with an ROC-derived optimal cutoff of 96.6 yielding a sensitivity of 69.6% and specificity of 76.5% (AUC = 0.733, p = 0.004). This study reveals that RNR demonstrates reasonable potential as a predictor of AVN in Nigerian SCD patients and could serve as an easily accessible biomarker for SCD risk stratification, particularly in resource-limited settings. Further studies are needed for validation of its clinical utility and possible integration into SCD management protocols."

    "abstract": "The inheritance of the sickle gene (hemoglobin S) and another abnormal hemoglobin gene is described as sickle cell disease, and the homozygous form of the disease is hemoglobin SS. In sickle cell disease, abdominal pain is a common symptom attributed to circulatory stasis and vascular occlusion, along with chest and musculoskeletal pain for which nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are often prescribed. This report presents the case of a 21-year-old man with sequential gastric and ileal perforations related to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug usage. Gastrointestinal perforation should be considered as a differential diagnosis in patients who present with abdominal pain accompanied with symptoms such as peritonitis, shock, or sepsis. Furthermore, perforation may be sequential with perforation of the stomach followed by that of the ileum. The use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in patients with sickle cell disease requires further revaluation."

    "abstract": "We sought to understand barriers to care among adults with sickle cell disease (SCD) within our healthcare system. This qualitative descriptive study was conducted as part of a needs and assets assessment in preparation for the development of an adult sickle cell clinic. We conducted key informant interviews (n = 19) and a focus group (n = 10) with administrators, patients, caregivers and healthcare providers (HCPs). Audio recordings were transcribed verbatim, coded inductively and analysed thematically. Four themes emerged: (1) People with SCD identified structural barriers, such as the lack of individualised care, access barriers to medical, community, adult-specific resources and inadequate transitional care support from paediatric to adult care. (2) HCP-related barriers, which included a lack of understanding and education, communication gaps and access barriers to finding HCPs trained in caring for people with SCD. (3) Discrimination biases by HCPs and outright prejudice towards people with SCD. (4) Financial barriers such as lack of incentives for comprehensive SCD centres and HCPs and funding reimbursement. We found that adult people with SCD had unique challenges. Interestingly, patients had perspectives similar to HCPs, while administrators were more focused on the financial barriers that affect continuity of care. These barriers require a concerted and multidisciplinary effort from patients, caregivers, HCPs, administrators and the community. Patients, caregivers and community members played a crucial role in this study by sharing their lived experiences and perspectives on barriers to care for adults with SCD."

    "abstract": "Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) experience painful vaso-occlusive episodes that increase with age; a subset develops chronic pain (CP). CP is usually managed with acute pain management guidelines despite evidence of ineffectiveness. Buprenorphine (BUP), a partial opioid agonist, is a potent analgesic with less euphoric effect and a respiratory \"ceiling effect.\" BUP therefore provides an alternative \"harm reduction\" approach for CP management in pediatric SCD patients. This single urban center retrospective study assessed the feasibility of inpatient transition to BUP-containing analgesics in adolescents with SCD and CP. Patients aged 12-20 years who transitioned from full opioid agonists (FOA) to BUP between December 2020 and September 2022 were included. Acute care utilization, hospital length of stay, and FOA use in both inpatient and outpatient settings were compared pre- and post-BUP induction for up to a year. Fourteen adolescents with SCD underwent inpatient BUP induction and maintenance therapy. Inpatient transition using a micro-induction approach was feasible and well tolerated in this population. There were low rates of adverse events, such as opioid withdrawal signs. Maintenance on BUP products was sustainable over the 1-year post-induction period. Three patients (21%) discontinued BUP during maintenance therapy. There was a significant reduction (p < 0.05) in acute care utilization, length of stay, and FOA use (both inpatient and outpatient). Inpatient micro-induction to BUP from FOA in adolescent SCD patients with CP is feasible with minimal signs of opioid withdrawal. This study suggests decreased acute care utilization with BUP."

We examined the associations between medical factors (SCD genotype, silent infarct/stroke, etc), socioeconomic factors (insurance type), and neuropsychological outcomes (reading and math achievement, psychological symptoms) in youth with SCD. A chart review was conducted for 108 Black/African American youth with SCD (M<sub>age</sub> = 10.80, SD = 3.53, 54.6% males) referred for neuropsychological evaluation. Patients were administered Wechsler-series tests of intelligence and academic achievement. Psychological symptoms were measured using the caregiver report Child Behavior Checklist. Zero-order correlations, analyses of variance (ANOVAs), and hierarchical linear regression models examined the associations between variables. Youth with less severe SCD genotypes (SC/SBeta+ thalassemia) had more externalizing problems. Youth with Medicaid/no insurance had more internalizing, externalizing, and somatic symptoms. Low full-scale intelligence quotient (FSIQ) strongly predicted poor academic achievement scores above other factors. Results highlight the importance of early neuropsychological/psychosocial screenings in SCD."

    "abstract": "A man in his 60s with dry eye symptoms was noted to have angioid streaks under the peripapillary retina. Congenital dyserythropoietic anaemia was the major health issue throughout his life, requiring venesection for iron overload, but no transfusions for many years. Close inspection of the eyes with optical coherence tomography also detected small subclinical optic disc drusen, which have not been reported in association with congenital dyserythropoietic anaemia. Together, optic disc drusen and angioid streaks represent an ectopic calcification phenotype in the eye and can be seen in the more common inherited condition of pseudoxanthoma elasticum or other inherited haemolytic anaemias such as sickle cell or thalassaemia. These associations highlight the role of pyrophosphate as a physiological inhibitor of calcification, and deficiencies of serum pyrophosphate lead to excessive and ectopic calcification. This raises intriguing hypotheses for the treatment of optic disc drusen, angioid streaks and other conditions of ectopic calcification."

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) with vaso-occlusive pain crisis (VOC) has a major impact on healthcare resource utilisation and poses a significant financial burden for the patients. This study examines the economic implications of managing VOC in individuals with SCD in India, from the perspectives of patients, healthcare system and society. This cross-sectional, observational study included 1000 patients with SCD across 14 centres enrolled from November 2021 to June 2022. Data were collected systematically using a structured electronic case record form. Employing a cost-of-illness approach, the study assessed the economic impact of SCD and VOC management, including assessing patient/caregiver costs, healthcare provider costs and societal burdens extrapolated to the larger SCD population in India. Patients incurred substantial out-of-pocket expenses, with a median (IQR) annual expenditure of INR 22 080/US$267 (IQR: INR 36 990/US$447.7), representing 14.65% (26.53) of their annual household income. Overall, catastrophic healthcare expenditure (CHE) for total annual average SCD care with VOC management was experienced by 624 patients (62.40%). Moreover, 334 patients (33.4%) experienced CHE of >25% of the annual household income. Patients with SCD with VOC had significantly higher median annual healthcare expenditures and used a higher median percentage of their yearly household income on healthcare compared with those without VOC (19.82% vs 6.08%; p<0.001). Cost incurred by healthcare providers for VOC management in different healthcare facilities (outpatient department/emergency department/intensive care unit) was similar across different reimbursed facilities (government tertiary care hospitals, non-governmental organisation-operated healthcare centres and government-subsidised healthcare setups). The estimated societal burden for VOC management in 1 year for 1000 patients visiting different healthcare facilities was around INR 35 119 074 (~US$0.42 million). These findings highlight the considerable economic strain on both patients and healthcare providers in SCD and VOC management, which is similar to the other non-communicable diseases emphasising the urgent need for targeted interventions to improve financial hardships among patients. The study was funded by Novartis Healthcare Private Limited."

Despite the extensive literature on SCD, studies focusing on in-hospital racial inequities remain limited. <b>Methods:</b> We conducted a retrospective analysis using the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) from 2016 to 2020, identifying adult hospitalizations for SCD (HbSS genotype). Hospitalizations were categorized by race-White, African American, Hispanic, and other, and analyzed for demographic variables, admission types, disposition outcomes, and complications. Statistical analyses included chi-square tests and multivariate logistic regression, adjusting for confounders. <b>Results:</b> Of the 1,089,270 identified hospitalizations, 90.31% were African American. African American and Hispanic patients exhibited significantly higher non-elective admissions compared to Whites (77.81%). In-hospital mortality was highest among Hispanics (0.82%). Multivariate regression analysis revealed that African Americans and others had higher odds of prolonged hospital stays (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR): 1.30 and 1.20, respectively). African Americans and Hispanics also had increased risks of in-hospital complications of SCD. <b>Conclusions:</b> This study highlights substantial racial disparities in SCD hospitalizations, with African Americans and Hispanics facing poorer outcomes compared to Whites. Hispanics also demonstrated increased mortality. These findings underscore the need for targeted healthcare interventions to address racial inequities in SCD management and improve outcomes for all affected populations."

    "abstract": "This report details a rare pediatric case of hyperammonemic encephalopathy caused by the oral iron chelating drug deferasirox (DFR) in a septic patient. It is our contention that this study lends support to the existing literature, as it describes the case of a 15-year-old female patient with a history of sickle-cell disease who presented with a fever and vomiting, rapid development of sleepiness, consciousness disturbances, medium mydriasis, neck stiffness, and trismus with seizure. Her Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score was 5. Laboratory tests revealed an increase in creatinine, metabolic acidosis, hyperammonemia, high cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) glutamine levels, alterations in coagulation and in liver function, rising inflammatory markers, cerebral oedema on brain Computerized Tomography (CT) scan, 10^6 copies/ml of Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) in pulmonary swab film array, and elevated DFR blood level. The treatment plan involved the early cessation of DFR, the correction of acidosis, mechanical ventilation, mannitol and bioarginine, vasoactive drug, antibiotics, and supportive care with continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) for hyperammonemia and therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) for a high CSF glutamine level resulting from cytotoxic encephalopathy. The patient successfully overcame the multiorgan failure, with no permanent neurologic complications. It is our opinion that healthcare providers and family caregivers of patients with chronic disease may be particularly attuned to the emergence of any sign or symptom, and thus well positioned to take prompt action to avert life-threatening clinical deterioration due to rising DFR levels. It is recommended that critical care providers commence extracorporeal blood purification therapies (EBPT) at the earliest opportunity, taking care to adapt the technique to the specific needs of the patient and to avoid the potential for fatal neurological complications."

In SCR abnormal sickling of erythrocytes is associated with sight-threatening complications such as neovascularisation, vitreous haemorrhage, maculopathy and retinal detachment. Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) is a novel imaging modality enabling non-invasive assessment of retinal vasculature. This systematic review provides an up-to-date evaluation of the role of OCTA in SCR diagnosis and management. We searched MEDLINE/PubMed, Cumulated Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), SCOPUS and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) electronic databases. The methodological quality of included studies was evaluated according to the STrengthening the Reporting of OBservational studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) recommendations. 31 studies met the inclusion criteria, and 26 suitably complied with the STROBE recommendations. Participant characteristics, including haemoglobin genotype, Goldberg staging, and visual acuity, were reported in twenty-eight (93%), twenty-six (86.6%), and fifteen (50%) studies, respectively. There was no consistent association between OCTA findings and haemoglobin genotype, Goldberg staging or visual acuity. Meta-analysis revealed that foveal avascular zone (FAZ) size and mean vessel density of the superficial and deep capillary plexi were significantly altered in patients with SCR compared to healthy controls. The mean vessel density of the superficial and deep capillary plexus was significantly lower in patients with SCR. OCTA can quantitatively detect retinal vascular remodelling in patients with SCR. Further research should focus on the clinical utility of OCTA for predicting SCR progression and its role in automating SCR staging using machine learning techniques."

    "abstract": "Despite improvements in the diversity of the United States biomedical research workforce, individuals from different racial/ethnic groups remain underrepresented. Even though mentoring is critical for career advancement, underrepresented faculty have limited opportunities. Therefore, we evaluated a multi-pronged mentoring approach for early-stage underrepresented faculty trained in the Programs to Increase Diversity Among Individuals Engaged in Health-Related Research-Functional and Translational Genomics of Blood Disorders. The selection process involved a rigorous review of applications, considering factors such as academic potential, research interests, and commitment to diversity in biomedical research. This year-long training experience includes two Summer Institutes consisting of lectures, grant-writing workshops, and laboratory practicums. In addition, a Mentoring Committee, comprised of research, career development, and peer-mentors, was established. The national Coordination Core collected program evaluations, grants, publications, and academic promotion data. Since 2007, PRIDE-FTG has trained 114 investigators, including 94 Black/African American investigators and 87 assistant professors; 65 mentees (57%) conducted research related to sickle cell disease. The primary outcome metric for PRIDE-FTG is the submission of an extramural National Institutes of Health or equivalent grant within two years of training completion. Seventy percent of 90 mentees achieved this metric and 44.4% was funded as principal investigators. Lastly, 55 mentees were promoted to higher academic ranks, and 90 mentees published 1,465 peer-reviewed manuscripts. Our data demonstrated the long-term impact of PRIDE-FTG training on the career advancement of early-stage underrepresented investigators. The success of this structured, mentored training program instills a sense of optimism about the future of diversity in our nation."

    "abstract": "More individuals with SCD are living beyond initial life expectancy. Despite a growing population of older adults with SCD, little is known about their unique experiences and needs. Understanding the perspectives of older adults with SCD (age ≥ 50 years) could provide insight on the most pressing concerns that healthcare providers should focus on and strategies to promote healthy aging. The purpose of this study was to describe the aging experiences of older adults with SCD. In this qualitative descriptive study, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 19 older adults with SCD who received care at a single comprehensive sickle cell program in the Southeastern United States. Data were analyzed using conventional content analysis. A total of 3 themes were identified. Theme 1 was \"challenges with aging\" with 2 subthemes: (a) internal challenges and (b) external challenges. Theme 2 was \"wisdom gained with age for prevention and management of complications\" with 2 subthemes: (a) lifestyle modifications and preventing complications and (b) managing sickle cell pain. Theme 3 was \"living beyond life expectancy\" with 2 subthemes: (a) differences in expectations for life expectancy and (b) factors contributing to longevity. These perspectives from older adults with SCD provide guidance for healthcare providers on areas that are most important to them as they age. This also provides practical strategies for prevention and self-management of SCD complications that our participants reported contributed to their quality of life and longevity."

    "abstract": "Elevated plasma triacylglycerol (TAG) levels are associated with endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, and increased vascular complications, particularly in populations such as individuals with sickle cell disease (SCD). This study aimed to investigate the effect of a single exercise session on postprandial TAG levels in children with SCD following the consumption of a high-fat meal. The high-fat meal was used to induce a significant postprandial increase in plasma triayglecrol (TAG) levels, aknown risk factor for endothelial dysfunction and vascular implication, particualry in population with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD). Twelve male children with SCD (mean age: 10.5 ± 1.2 years) participated in two 2-day trials, one involving brisk walking (exercise trial) and one with rest (rest trial), in a randomized, counter-balanced design. A mixed high-fat test meal (97 g fat, 124 g carbohydrate, 1,450 kcal) was administered after a 10-h overnight fast, and blood samples were collected at baseline, 60, 120, 240, 300, and 360 min post-meal to measure serum TAG, glucose, insulin, and total cholesterol concentrations. Postprandial TAG levels significantly increased in both trials, but the exercise trial showed a significantly lower TAG response compared to the rest trial (<i>P</i> < 0.05). The area under the curve (AUC) for TAG was greater in the rest trial than in the exercise trial (<i>P</i> < 0.05). Specifically, TAG concentrations were significantly lower in the exercise trial at 120 and 180 min post-meal (<i>P</i> < 0.05), indicating faster clearance of TAG following exercise. Insulin and glucose concentrations also increased post-meal, with significantly lower insulin and glucose AUC values in the exercise trial compared to the rest trial (<i>P</i> < 0.05). No significant differences were observed in total cholesterol between the two trials at 360 min post-meal. These findings suggest that a single bout of exercise prior to a high-fat meal reduces postprandial TAG concentrations in children with SCD, consistent with previous studies in healthy populations. The reduction in postprandial TAG may have implications for improving endothelial function and reducing the risk of cardiovascular and vaso-occlusive events in individuals with SCD. Further studies are needed to explore the long-term effects of regular exercise on lipid metabolism and disease complications in this population."

Physical therapists provide interventions that restore functional capacity and promote independence, but it is unclear if these services are utilized by youth with SCD. This study aimed to describe physical therapy (PT) referral patterns and attendance rates among adolescents and young adults (AYA) with SCD, while also exploring if referral and receipt of outpatient PT were associated with age or HR-QoL. This retrospective chart review assessed youth aged ≥13 years who attended one or more multidisciplinary SCD clinic appointment between Septmenber 2010 and September 2023 where they completed one or more HR-QoL assessments. Demographic, PT referral and attendance, and HR-QoL data were collected from the electronic health record. A total of 150 AYA with SCD met inclusion criteria, and 40% (n = 60) were referred for outpatient PT. Primary reasons for referral included joint pain/issues (50%), deconditioning (20%), and unspecific chronic pain (12%). Of those referred for outpatient PT, 61% (n = 37) completed one or more PT visits. Age did not predict referral (p = 0.12) or attendance (p = 0.81). Having a lower physical functioning HR-QoL score was associated with being referred for PT (p < 0.001) but not with attending PT (p = 0.26). AYAs with SCD are frequently referred to outpatient PT for a range of functional impairments and physical limitations. Findings suggest that AYA with SCD may face significant barriers to attending outpatient PT, and future studies are needed to identify and mitigate these challenges."

Descriptive statistics were calculated and survival analyses performed using Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression. Thirty-four patients with RMC were identified. Median age was 19 years (IQR: 15-28; range: 7-52). Most were male (24/34; 71%), Black (27/32; 84%), had sickle cell trait or disease (30/33; 91%), presented with metastatic disease (27/34; 79%), and were symptomatic at presentation (32/34; 94%). Median overall survival (OS) was 24 months from diagnosis (16 months for children, 28 months for adults, p = 0.6). Receipt of platinum-based chemotherapy (23/34; 68%) was associated with significantly higher OS than other regimens (35 vs. 5 months, p < 0.001). Nephrectomy (24/34; 71%) was associated with significantly improved OS compared with non-operative management (34 vs. 7 months, p = 0.001). Immunotherapy, targeted therapy, or radiation therapy were not associated with significant differences in OS, nor were age, sex, race, sickle cell status, SMARCB1/INI-1, stage, nephrectomy approach, retroperitoneal lymph node dissection, gross residual disease, margins, or tumor size. RMC survival remains poor despite newer therapies. Nephrectomy and platinum-based chemotherapy should be considered in locally advanced and metastatic disease. Coordinated international cooperative group studies are needed to meaningfully improve RMC survival."

    "abstract": "The removal of the toxic oxidized cholesterol, 7-ketocholesterol (7KC), from cells through the administration of therapeutics has the potential to treat atherosclerosis and various other pathologies. While cholesterol is a necessary building block for homeostasis, oxidation of cholesterol can lead to the formation of toxic oxysterols with 7KC being the most prominent. 7KC is primarily formed through the non-enzymatic oxidation of cholesterol and is found in high levels in oxidized LDL (oxLDL) particles, which are highly implicated in heart disease. 7KC is implicated in the pathogenesis of numerous diseases, including multiple sclerosis, hypercholesterolemia, sickle cell anemia, and multiple age-related diseases. Of particular interest is the role of 7KC in the progression of atherosclerosis, with several studies associating elevated 7KC levels with the etiology and severity of the disease and in the underlying transition of macrophages to foam cells. This research aims to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of UDP-003, a novel therapeutic compound, in mitigating the harmful effects of 7KC in mouse and human monocyte and macrophage cell lines. Experimental evidence demonstrates that administration of UDP-003 can reverse the foam cell phenotype, rejuvenating these cells by returning phagocytic function, preventing loss in efferocytosis ability, and decreasing both reactive oxygen species (ROS) and intracellular lipid droplet accumulation. We further demonstrate that UDP-003 drives urinary excretion of 7KC in vivo and has a safety/toxicity profile compatible with initiation of human clinical trials. Our data suggest that the targeted removal of 7KC from foam cells with UDP-003 can potentially prevent and reverse atherosclerotic plaque formation. UDP-003 has the potential to be the first disease-modifying therapeutic approach to treating atherosclerotic disease."

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD), the most common genetic disorder in the United States, disproportionately affects Black individuals. A major aspect of SCD is the experience of vaso-occlusive episodes, a feature often characterized by debilitating pain which may necessitate emergency department (ED) visits. In the ED, adults with SCD often experience discrimination due to intersecting identities of race and disease status. Considerably less is known about experiences of discrimination for youth with SCD. This review aims to: (1) critically examine available research on the experiences of discrimination and stigma among youth with SCD in the United States, (2) describe measures currently used to assess pediatric stigma and/or discrimination, and (3) identify gaps in the literature to guide research. We conducted a scoping review using a modified version of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review (PRISMA) and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Data were searched from database inception to May 2023. Initially, 285 articles were retrieved; after duplicate removal, 214 articles remained. Reports of stigma varied by informant (i.e., caregiver, youth, or providers), method (i.e., qualitative or quantitative), and measure. A better understanding of experiences of stigma and discrimination across development for youth with SCD is needed. Research aimed at reducing stigma and discrimination and its consequences in youth with SCD is warranted to enhance quality of life and improve health outcomes."

It is highly prevalent in Sub-saharan Africa with Nigeria ranking highest for people living with the disease. Blood pressure recording in individuals with SCA has been known to be influenced by certain factors such as age, sex, body mass index and hemoglobin level. The study seeks to examine the relationship of certain pre-selected factors -age, gender, body mass index, disease severity and microalbuminuria/proteinuria on the blood pressure of children with SCA and document the relationship (if any) between above factors and the blood pressure readings of Nigerian children with SCA. A cross-sectional hospital-based study that consecutively recruited 106 children with sickle cell anaemia (HbSS) aged 3-17 years in steady state as well as age and sex-matched controls with HbAA genotype. Sociodemographic, clinical and anthropometric parameters were obtained. Severity of the disease and renal complication were assessed using Adeleke scoring method and microalbuminuria/ proteinuria assay. Subjects in crisis or had crisis in the past 4 weeks or genotype HbSC were excluded. For controls (genotype AA), those on management for congenital heart disease (CHD), hypertension and renal pathology were excluded. Weight and body mass index (BMI) were significantly lower in subjects compared to controls (p = 0.010 & 0.029 respectively). In subjects, the most common clinical attributes at presentation was bone pain (31.1% subjects), previous hospital admission (74.5%) and known steady state PCV (33.9%). Most of the subjects (87.74%) had mild SCA disease severity. Only two subjects (1.8%) had elevated BP while one subject (0.9%) had hypertension.Microalbuminuria (28.2%) and proteinuria (13.2%) were seen in subjects. While one control had elevated BP, none had hypertension. There was an initial positive relationship between increasing age (p= 0.007), low BMI (p= 0.008), presence of microalbuminuria/ proteinuria (Renal injury) p= 0.03 and raised blood pressure,but none of these associations was found to be an independent predictor of hypertension. Elevated diastolic blood pressure and diastolic hypertension in children with SCA were shown to have an initial positive association with increasing age, low BMI and renal injury. These should be guarded against by instituting screening program and measures to stall progression."

    "title": "Impact of Voxelotor on Red Blood Cell Exchange Therapeutic Procedures: Evaluation of Multi-Institutional Procedure Data.",
    "abstract": "Hemoglobin S (HbS) polymerization inhibitor drugs such as voxelotor can result in a split peak in HbS as well as additional peaks with hemoglobin A in quantitative methods of HbS measurement. It is unclear how these results should be used to make transfusion decisions. The goal of this study is to compare RBC exchange (RBCX) replacement volumes calculated with HbS-Vox + HbS versus HbS alone. Patients aged 15-58 years who had variant hemoglobin quantitation performed for clinical care purposes with evidence of voxelotor treatment (split peak in HbS and/or additional peaks with hemoglobin A) were identified by investigator review of variant hemoglobin quantitation test results from the clinical laboratory. The RBCX replacement volume calculated with HbS% total (RBCX volume HbS% total) was compared to the RBCX replacement volume calculated with HbS unmod% (RBCX volume HbS unmod%) in each case. The mean difference between RBCX volume total HbS% and RBCX volume HbS% unmod is 398 mL with 95% CI (198, 598) and RBCX volume total HbS is significantly different from RBCX volume HbS unmod (p value = 0.0006). If the HbS total is not used to calculate RBCX replacement volumes in patients taking voxelotor, there is a significantly lower amount of RBC that would be ordered, which would lead to higher HbS after RBCX. Additional studies regarding the role of transfusion in such patients are necessary."

DN is common among youth with sickle cell disease (SCD), but its implications on absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) and hydroxyurea over time are unclear. Our retrospective review found that all children who were not receiving hydroxyurea had stable ANC through age 9 years, but those with DN had lower mean ANC starting at 6 years of age. Among hydroxyurea users, ANC increased over time, regardless of DN status, suggesting opportunities to optimize hydroxyurea. Future studies of hospitalized and older individuals are needed to further examine DN's impact on people with SCD."

    "abstract": "Significant progress in managing sickle cell disease (SCD) has led to improved mortality and a growing population of people living with SCD. Sexual and reproductive health (SRH) for individuals with SCD is a critical but under-addressed aspect of care. This study characterizes clinicians' current practices in SRH care for adolescents with SCD. In a cross-sectional qualitative study, we recruited clinicians who care for adolescents with SCD from a national professional listserv. Participants completed in-depth semistructured qualitative interviews over video conference from May 2022 to May 2023. The study involved 20 SCD providers (14 female and 6 male). Interviews explored the clinician's role, perceived barriers and facilitators, and recommendations for SRH care for adolescents with SCD. Key concerns identified included managing vaso-occlusive events during menstruation, priapism, and contraceptive choice. Clinicians expressed different readiness for incorporating SRH care in their practice and identified barriers, such as training, time, and subspecialist availability. While all participants acknowledged the priority of SRH care for adolescents with SCD, clearly outlined guidelines are needed to enhance counseling and the provision of SRH care. Clinicians with specific expertise or familiarity with the patient are best suited to providing aspects of SRH care. This study emphasizes clinician interest in comprehensive SRH care for individuals with SCD. Well-defined guidelines are necessary to aid clinicians in addressing the unique SRH needs in SCD. Further study is needed to understand patient attitudes and establish evidence-based guidelines for SRH in SCD."

    "abstract": "While sickle cell disease (SCD) is primarily acknowledged as an erythrocyte disorder, emerging evidence suggests a role for altered neutrophil phenotype and function in SCD pathophysiology and disease severity. Given the conflicting findings in previous studies, we performed a comprehensive exploration of neutrophil characteristics in SCD patients during steady state and vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC), as well as in response to therapeutic interventions. Neutrophil phenotype was assessed by flow cytometry and functional properties were evaluated by measurement of neutrophil adhesion and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. A total of 49 SCD patients (of whom 19 during both steady state and VOC) along with 16 healthy ethnicity-matched and 30 non-matched controls, were included in the study. Differences were observed between neutrophils from patients compared to controls and between control groups. Neutrophil phenotype was more activated in SCD patients compared to non-matched controls. Neutrophil adhesion was increased in steady-state SCD patients compared to both ethnicity-matched and non-matched controls. While neutrophil phenotype in SCD patients differed from non-matched controls, in contrast to earlier studies, the differences in neutrophil phenotype between SCD patients and ethnicity-matched controls were modest. <i>In vitro</i> neutrophil adhesion was higher in SCD patients than in ethnicity-matched and non-matched controls. Potential explanations for the discrepancies between earlier findings and our study are the large variation in neutrophil phenotypes between individuals, methodological variability between studies and differences in the time interval between blood sample collection and the measurements."

    "abstract": "Neonatal red blood cell (RBC) disorders encompass a diverse range of inherited and acquired conditions with significant clinical implications. Due to the unique morphological and biochemical characteristics of neonatal erythrocytes, accurate diagnosis is often challenging but critical for effective management. This review aims to synthesize current knowledge on the diagnosis of neonatal RBC disorders, highlighting the integration of traditional morphological analysis with advanced biochemical and molecular techniques. A comprehensive literature review was conducted to examine diagnostic approaches to neonatal enzymopathies, membrane disorders, and hemoglobinopathies. The roles of peripheral blood smear (PBS) analysis, enzyme activity assays, and genetic testing-including next-generation sequencing (NGS)-were evaluated in the context of current clinical practice. Peripheral blood smear examination remains a foundational tool for identifying characteristic RBC morphologies. Enzymatic deficiencies such as G6PD and pyruvate kinase deficiency, membrane disorders including hereditary spherocytosis and elliptocytosis, and hemoglobinopathies such as thalassemias and sickle cell disease require integrated diagnostic strategies. Advances in molecular diagnostics have enhanced diagnostic precision and expanded the ability to perform early, genotype-driven interventions. A multidisciplinary diagnostic approach that combines morphology, biochemistry, and genetics is essential for the accurate identification and management of neonatal RBC disorders. Bridging traditional microscopy with modern genomic tools offers the potential for earlier diagnosis, personalized treatment, and improved clinical outcomes in neonatal hematology."

    "abstract": "Prevention and management of chronic diseases have been integrated into the primary healthcare system in recent years. However, due to the social, cultural and geographical barriers, patients of one of such chronic illnesses, viz., sickle cell disease (SCD) have poor utilization and access to healthcare services. Hence, this study explored the utilization of outpatient services by SCD patients and associated factors in five SCD-endemic tribal districts of India. This cross-sectional quantitative study was conducted on 263 SCD patients or their caregivers and 263 corresponding controls recruited from 5 SCD endemic districts. Data on utilizing outpatient services and health system-related characteristics were collected using a pretested questionnaire. Multiple logistic regression was conducted to explore the association between utilization of outpatient services and independent variables. About 80% of the patients reported the public healthcare system as a regular source of healthcare. 86% of the patients and 65% of the controls or their families visited primary health centres (PHCs) in the past year. More than two-thirds of the patients (67.7%) and more than half of the controls (50.6%) didn't face any problems accessing PHC services. Patients with 6-10 years of schooling (adjusted odds ratio (AOR)=0.45), annual family income of USD 480 to USD 720 (AOR=0.41) and more than USD 720 (AOR=0.35), >15 kilometres of distance to PHCs (AOR=0.32) are less likely to visit PHCs. The primary healthcare system was a regular source of medical care for the majority of the population, and utilization of outpatient services at PHCs was high in our study. Hence, this study emphasizes strengthening screening and management of SCD right from the primary healthcare level so that the healthcare needs of SCD patients can be met for the continuum of care."

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a significant public health concern in Nigeria. Despite widespread awareness campaigns advocating for premarital phenotype testing, many couples still make marital decisions that increase the risk of having children with SCD. This study aims to explore the factors influencing marital decisions among parents of children with SCD, focusing on the relationship between phenotype awareness and marital choices. This mixed-method study was conducted among 209 parents of children with SCD receiving care at the paediatric haematology clinics of University College Hospital (UCH) and Oni Memorial Children Hospital (OMCH) in Ibadan, Nigeria. Quantitative data were collected through interviewer-administered structured questionnaires. Qualitative data were obtained through key informant interviews with stakeholders, including parents, healthcare providers, and SCD advocates. Qualitative data were thematically analysed and integrated with the quantitative findings. Findings revealed low premarital awareness of sickle cell phenotypes as only 14.5% of couples had mutual knowledge, while 36.7% were completely unaware. Key factors influencing phenotype combinations that carry risk of SCD birth included a willingness to \"take the risk and hope for the best\" (46.7%), limited understanding of the implications of SCD (33.3%), willingness to bear consequences (26.7%) and reliance on faith (20%). Higher educational levels correlated with improved awareness. This study identifies significant gaps in premarital genetic awareness. Key gaps include a lack of knowledge about the implications of phenotype combinations and the tendency to prioritise cultural, emotional and religious factors over genetic risk considerations when making marital decisions. To bridge these gaps, improved public health education, accessible pre-marital genetic counselling and strategic engagement with religious and community leaders are essential to translating awareness into informed action."

Animal studies and limited human data have raised concern that HU exposures in pregnancy may increase the risk of congenital malformations or abnormal fetal growth. Although the quality of evidence is low, it has been recommended that HU is discontinued at least 3 months before conception. We systematically reviewed all published studies up to July 2024 describing pregnancy and neonatal outcomes after HU exposure during pregnancy. A total of 329 articles went through title and abstract screening, which resulted in 54 articles undergoing full-text review, and 15 articles were finally eligible for data extraction. These 15 studies included in the review, published between 1993 and 2023, comprised 7227 pregnancies, with 567 pregnancies (7.8%) exposed to HU. Patient ages ranged from 17 to 45 years. Most patients had SCD (n = 502), followed by chronic myeloid leukemia (n = 26), essential thrombocythemia (n = 24), and chronic myeloid splenomegaly (n = 2). In 13 cases, the underlying disease was not specified. The timing of exposures to HU varied from conception until throughout pregnancy. Neither teratogenic nor hematologic effects on the fetus were observed in these cases. Pregnancy risks associated with HU are lower than anticipated. The use of HU in pregnancy may be justified considering the significant risks associated to untreated conditions, such as SCD."

    "abstract": "Prior analyses have reported on the impact of different donor types and conditioning regimen intensities on outcomes for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) who undergo hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), and demonstrated superior outcomes using an HLA-matched related donor (MRD). However, the impact of conditioning regimen intensity on outcomes remains unclear, with conflicting findings across studies. In addition, the lack of data on comparative outcomes of different approaches to conditioning and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis for allogeneic HCT for SCD remains a gap in the field. We compared outcomes for SCD patients who have received HLA-matched related donor (MRD) HCT for SCD using different HCT regimens. We examined de-identified records of MRD HCT for SCD on patients transplanted between 1991 and 2022 in the United States and submitted to the CIBMTR. We compared the most common transplant regimens in the registry, which included TBI 300/400 cGy + sirolimus + anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG)/alemtuzumab described by Hsieh et al; Busulfan/Fludarabine + CNI/methotrexate (MTX) + ATG/alemtuzumab as described by Krishnamurti et al.; Fludarabine/Melphalan + CNI/MTX + ATG/alemtuzumab as described by King et al.; and Busulfan/Cyclophosphamide (CY) + CNI /MTX/prednisone + ATG/alemtuzumab as described by Walters et al. For pediatric MRD HCT, EFS rates were highest with the Krishnamurti et al. (3-year EFS 94%, 95% CI 88, 100) and lowest with the Hsieh et al. regimen (3-year EFS 57%, 95% CI 25, 100, p<0.001). Rates of chronic GVHD were lowest in the Hsieh et al. cohort (3-year rate 0%) and highest in the King et al. cohort (3-year rate 20.4%, 95% CI 13.2, 28.8, p=0.040). For adult MRD HCT, EFS rates were similar between the Hsieh et al. and Krishnamurti et al. regimens, while cGVHD was significantly lower in the Hsieh et al. cohort. These real-world data have the potential to inform shared decision-making in MRD HCT for SCD. Pediatric patients had the highest EFS rates using myeloablative conditioning regimens, while non-myeloablative conditioning resulted in the lowest EFS rates. Adult patients had similar event-free survival using myeloablative and non-myeloablative conditioning regimens, with less GVHD following non-myeloablative regimens."

    "abstract": "Hematopoietic stem transplantation (HSCT) from matched related donors (MRD) is offered as a curative therapeutic option in children with Sickle cell disease (SCD). We wanted to assess the outcome and long-term complications observed in children undergoing HSCT at a single transplant center in Saudi Arabia. One hundred and twenty-nine children were transplanted for severe Sickle cell disease (SCD) consecutively from 2006 to 2020 at our center. The main transplant indication was cerebral vasculopathy in 57 (43%), followed by the recurrent vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) in 47 (36%). Median age at transplant was 9.1 years (range, 1.5-13.9 years). All patients received myeloablative conditioning with Busulfan, Cyclophosphamide, and Anti T-Lymphocyte Globulin (Grafalon®): BU/CY/ATG in 114 (88.4%), BU/CY in 13 (10%) and other in 2 (2%). Bone marrow was the main stem cell source in 123 (95%). All patients showed granulocyte engraftment. Acute graft-versus-host-disease (aGVHD) and chronic GVHD were observed in 26 (20%) and 12 (9%) patients, respectively. At a median follow-up of 4.36 years (range, 0.13-15.5 years), 10-year overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) of 94% and 91% was observed. The OS and EFS were significantly better in patients receiving BU/CY/ATG when compared to BU/CY (OS: 97.4%±1.5%, vs. 76.2%±12.1 <i>P=0.003</i> and EFS: 94.7%±2.1% vs. 76.2%±12.1%, <i>P=0.019</i>). HSCT for children with sickle cell disease from fully matched siblings offers the best outcome using myeloablative conditioning. However, significant toxicities were observed secondary to myeloablative regimens, in particular long-term complications, which demands exploring the use of less toxic regimens."

The purpose of this descriptive qualitative study was to identify what SDOH were most impactful to health care decision-making during different life stages for individuals with SCD who had experienced a gap in accessing medical care. Results indicated that perceptions of SDOH varied according to childhood, transitional, and adulthood life stages. Impactful SDOH in childhood relate to family support, peer relationships, academic experiences, and positive experiences in the health care system. During the transition life stage, peer support for independence and interactions with the health care system were impactful. Adulthood revealed that employment and experiences in the health care system influenced health care decisions. Health care professionals can use this information by prioritizing assessment related to SDOH relevant to each life stage. Additional research is needed to further explore SDOH by life stage and support intervention development."

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited hemoglobinopathy characterized by sickle-shaped red blood cells (RBCs). Primary cilia are mechanosensory organelles and are projected in the lumen of blood vessels to detect blood flow. We previously reported that interaction between microvasculature endothelial cells and sickled RBCs resulted in altered blood flow that can elevate reactive oxygen species, leading to increased deciliation in SCD patients. However, the impact of deciliation mediated by sickled RBCs in the context of the ciliary protein profiles remains unclear. Here, we investigated cell-cilia stability under different physiological shear-stress magnitudes and examined cilia protein profiles in SCD, utilizing mouse models and human participants. Our results demonstrate that subjecting endothelial cilia to sickled RBCs at 5.0 dyn/cm<sup>2</sup> led to significant deciliation events. The proteomic and bioinformatic analyses showed different ciliary protein profiles, distinct signaling pathways, and unique post-translational modification processes in the SCD mouse model. Consistent with the SCD mouse model results, our translational studies validated the enrichment of specific proteins, including Transferrin Receptor-1 (TfR1), Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate-Dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and ADP Ribosylation Factor Like GTPase-13B (ARL13B) in SCD patients. These findings underscore the clinical relevance of cilia in SCD and suggest that ciliary proteins are potential biomarkers for assessing vascular damage."

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) affects millions of individuals worldwide, and is characterized by both acute, episodic pain and chronic, persistent pain. Despite the significant burden of the disease, clinicians continue to face significant challenges in treating SCD pain due to variability in pain experiences. The objectives of this study were (1) to identify distinct pain subgroups based on demographic and biopsychosocial characteristics and (2) to evaluate the relationship between the subgroups and pain impact - a SCD-disease specific measure of pain interference. To achieve these objectives, we performed a hierarchical cluster analysis on a cross-sectional sample of adults with SCD who are enrolled in the Globin Research Network Data and Discovery (GRNDaD) registry. Five hundred thirty-two participants (61% females and 64% with chronic pain) were included in the analysis. Six distinct subgroups were identified, 3 with chronic pain (Clusters 1-3) and 3 without chronic pain (Clusters 4-6). Despite differences in biological markers of disease severity such as genotype, hemoglobin and fetal hemoglobin percentage, chronic pain subgroups had comparable odds of reporting worse pain impact, suggesting that chronic pain has a disproportionate influence on SCD pain when compared to other factors. Longitudinal studies are needed to further validate these findings and to determine how these pain subgroups may change. Overall, our findings indicate that understanding and preventing chronic pain in SCD must be a top priority to improve the quality of life of those living with SCD."

This study assessed medication utilization trends overall and by patient demographics. This retrospective study examined children aged 1-17 years diagnosed with SCD from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2018, in Optum's de-identified Clinformatics Data Mart database. Changes in medication utilization over time were assessed using Joinpoint regression. Stratified time trends were evaluated by patient age, sex, race/ethnicity, region, and household income level. Over the 8-year study period, a total of 1868 children with SCD were identified. Hydroxyurea prescriptions increased 8.8%, on average, each year of the study period (p < 0.001), indicating rising adherence to recommended disease-modifying strategies. Shifts in opioid prescribing showed increased oxycodone use (6.3% average annual increase, p < 0.001) and decreased acetaminophen-codeine use (24.3% average annual decrease, p < 0.001). Notably, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use increased by 4.0% annually (p = 0.010), reflecting shifts toward alternative pain management strategies. Significant shifts in medication utilization, overall and by patient demographics, were observed since the 2014 NHLBI SCD treatment guidelines were released. Our study findings underscore the dynamic nature of SCD management in children, and highlight the need for continuous evaluation of treatment guideline adherence, as well as treatment effectiveness and safety with the newer SCD medications and treatment guidelines, to optimize clinical outcomes among this vulnerable patient population."

Small noncoding nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) of the <i>Rpl13a</i> locus have been described as regulators of ROS levels. However, whether <i>Rpl13a</i> snoRNAs are present in sickle red blood cells (RBCs) and regulate ROS levels and whether they contribute to SCD pathophysiology remain unknown. To determine whether sickle RBC ROS levels are associated with <i>Rpl13a</i> snoRNA levels and identify the mechanism by which they regulate ROS and snoRNAs' effects on SCD hemodynamics, we used human RBCs, <i>Rpl13a</i> snoRNA knockout sickle mice, K562 <i>U32a</i>, <i>U33</i>, <i>U34</i>, <i>U35a</i>, and the control <i>U25</i> knockout mutants generated by CRISPR-Cas9-targeted genome editing, and genetic targeting with antisense oligonucleotides. Excessive ROS production in sickle RBCs of patients with SCD is associated with high <i>Rpl13a</i> snoRNAs <i>U32a</i>, <i>U33</i>, <i>U34</i>, and <i>U35a</i> levels. <i>U32a</i>, <i>U34</i>, and <i>U35a</i> regulate ROS and hydrogen peroxide levels in sickle erythroid populations by modulating peroxidase activity. This was due to <i>U32a</i>- and <i>U34</i>-guided 2'-O-methylation on <i>Prdx2</i> (peroxiredoxin 2) messenger RNA, a modification conveyed by fibrillarin during erythropoiesis, subsequently reducing Prdx2 expression and activity. The snoRNA <i>U35a</i> impaired Prdx2 expression/activity but independently of <i>Prdx2</i> messenger RNA 2'-O-methylation. Excess sickle RBC ROS increased in turn <i>Rpl13a</i> snoRNAs levels. In vivo targeting combinations of <i>U34</i>+<i>U35a</i> and <i>U32a</i>+<i>U34</i>+<i>U35a</i> in sickle mice with antisense oligonucleotide blunted RBC ROS generation, improved erythropoiesis and anemia, alleviated leukocytosis and endothelial damage, diminished cell adhesion in inflamed vessels and vaso-occlusion, restored blood flow, and reduced animal mortality. <i>Rpl13a</i> snoRNAs <i>U34</i> and <i>U35a</i> specifically increase ROS levels, which, in turn, regulate snoRNA expression, in sickle erythroid cells, modulating Prdx2 expression/activity, subsequently impairing hemodynamics. Targeted U34+<i>U35a</i> with antisense oligonucleotide may represent a novel and safe therapy to ameliorate erythropoiesis and downstream events in SCD."

Resveratrol, a potent natural antioxidant, has demonstrated protective effects in various vascular disorders. To evaluate the therapeutic effects of resveratrol on priapism, oxidative stress markers, and NO-cGMP signaling in the penile tissue of transgenic SCD mice. Male wild-type (C57BL/6) and transgenic SCD mice were treated with resveratrol (100 mg/kg/day, gavage) or vehicle for 2 weeks. Functional studies were conducted on CC strips mounted in organ baths to assess relaxation responses to acetylcholine (ACh), sodium nitroprusside (SNP), and nitrergic stimulation (electrical field stimulation, EFS). The oxidative stress markers (NOX-2, 4-HNE, and 3-NT), cGMP levels, and the mRNA expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) were evaluated. Resveratrol treatment decreased exaggerated ACh-, SNP-, and EFS-induced relaxation responses in SCD mice. It also reduced oxidative stress markers (NOX-2, 4-HNE, and 3-NT) and normalized eNOS and PDE5 mRNA expression in the CC of SCD mice. Additionally, cGMP levels in the CC were significantly increased by resveratrol treatment. These effects were specific to SCD mice and not observed in wild-type mice. In conclusion, resveratrol reduces oxidative stress and restores NO-cGMP signaling in the penile tissue, reducing the exaggerated cavernosal relaxation characteristic of priapism in SCD. These findings highlight resveratrol as a promising therapeutic candidate for managing priapism in patients with SCD."

In our study, we used transcranial ultrasound techniques to measure abnormal blood flow velocities in the internal carotid (ICA) and middle cerebral arteries (MCA) of transgenic sickle cell mice (SS) challenged with hypoxia-reoxygenation. Our study showed that SS mice that underwent hypoxic stress exhibited lower relative mean velocities in the MCA compared to wildtype mice (AA) (0.67 ± 0.18 vs. 0.95 ± 0.15; <i>p</i> < 0.05). Comparison of the Lindegaard ratio between normoxia and hypoxia in SS mice suggested that the MCA underwent vasodilation (0.67 ± 0.18 vs. 0.95 ± 0.15; <i>p</i> <i><</i> 0.05). Bilirubin, a potential biomarker for cerebral vasculopathies in SCD, was higher in SS than AA mice (0.56<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mo> </mo><mo>±</mo><mo> </mo></math>0.28 vs. 0.05<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mo> </mo><mo>±</mo><mo> </mo></math>0.07 mg/dL; <i>p</i> <i><</i> 0.05). Correlation analyses revealed a significant association between bilirubin levels and blood velocities of MCA (r = -0.9377, <i>p</i> = 0.0002) and ICA (r = 0.8203, <i>p</i> = 0.0068), especially in hypoxic conditions of SS mice. We propose that the reactivity of cerebral vessels in SS mice is correlated with the elevated plasma bilirubin level."

    "abstract": "Adult patients with sickle cell anemia (SCA) are at high risk for atrial arrhythmias; however, data on the outcomes of atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation in this population are scarce. Eight consecutive SCA patients undergoing AF ablation in three tertiary ablation centers were retrospectively included (6 males, mean age 46 ± 9 years). Patients exhibited severe left atrial (LA) remodeling (mean indexed LA volume 71 ± 14 mL/m<sup>2</sup>) and six presented with persistent AF. Ablation techniques included radiofrequency (RF, n = 6), cryoballoon (n = 1), and pulsed-field ablation (PFA, n = 1). Three patients received additional LA lesions beyond pulmonary vein isolation. At 12 months, seven patients (88%) were free from any atrial arrhythmia, with 88% off antiarrhythmic therapy, and NYHA class significantly improved from 2.00 ± 0.93 to 1.38 ± 0.52 (p = 0.049). No major complications were reported following RF ablations. The cryoballoon case was complicated by an acute chest syndrome, while moderate hemolysis occurred following PFA, without clinical consequence. AF catheter ablation appears effective in SCA patients. While RF ablation showed a reassuring safety profile, specific risks associated with cryoballoon and PFA warrant further investigation."

    "abstract": "Right ventricle (RV) dysfunction because of pulmonary vasculopathy is the most common cause of death in sickle cell disease (SCD). This study aimed to explore the diagnostic accuracy of blood-speckle tracking and vortex detection in the early detection of pulmonary vasculopathy in patients with SCD. This study was conducted as a cross-sectional study including thirty patients and thirty controls. Patients with SCD were examined using 3D echocardiography to determine the presence of RV dysfunction, as a surrogate of pulmonary vasculopathy: in addition to blood speckle tracking echocardiography to determine the vortex timing in the RV and its presence or absence in the pulmonary artery. Patients' demographic and hematologic data were also retrieved from patients' files. Pulmonary vortex formation was 100% sensitive in the detection of RV dysfunction. LDH (Lactate Dehydrogenase) was the only variable significantly different between cases with pulmonary vortex formation and those without (520 vs. 257, P < 0.001), LDH > 400 was 72% sensitive and 100% specific in the detection of pulmonary vortex formation. Pulmonary vortex formation was a sensitive indicator of RV dysfunction, thus suggesting its accuracy in the early detection of early pulmonary vascular changes in SCD. LDH as a marker of intravascular hemolysis, is a sensitive marker that can be used for risk stratification of SCD patients."

To determine the range of systemic alterations, we assessed the frequency of 12 immune populations and the levels of related cytokines in the peripheral blood of paediatric (n = 13) and adult (n = 12) patients with SCD prescribed hydroxyurea, as compared to paediatric (n = 5) and adult (n = 10) race-matched controls. Transcriptome analysis of the peripheral blood of paediatric SCD patients and controls was also performed. Flow cytometry showed a 3.5-fold increase (p = 0.005) in CD19+ B cells in paediatric SCD and a 52% decrease in central memory B cells (p = 0.002) in adult SCD. Paediatric transcriptomic data revealed significant upregulation of pro-B cell transcripts (27 genes, top 3: E2F2, RAD51, ASPM) and plasma cell transcripts (37 genes, top 3: IGF1, TNFRSF17, DERL3). Cytokine analyses showed significant increases in IL-2 (p = 0.013), IL-4 (p = 0.026), TNFβ (p = 0.039), IL-13 (p = 0.034) and BAFF (p = 0.041) in paediatric SCD, and an increase in CD40L and BAFF in adult SCD. In summary, our data showed alterations in the humoral immophenotype in paediatric SCD, specifically an increase in CD19+ B cells, suggesting there may be significant alterations of homeostasis in the humoral immune system in children with SCD treated with hydroxyurea."

    "abstract": "Structurally novel inhibitors of the lysine methyltransferase G9a have attracted considerable interest as potential drug candidates for cancer and genetic diseases. Here, a detailed account of potency optimization from early leads 8 and 9 to compound 16g is presented. Our search for an alternative scaffold for the 4-oxo-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1H-indole moiety of compounds 8 and 9 via parallel synthesis led to the identification of the 4-pyridin-4-ylamino phenyl substructure in compound 16g. This substructure was found to bind to the enzyme in a horizontally flipped manner compared with compound 8 in X-ray crystallographic analysis. Compound 16g is a highly potent G9a inhibitor (IC<sub>50</sub> = 0.0020 μM) and structurally distinct from other G9a inhibitors reported in the literature. Importantly, compound 16g exhibited dose-dependent induction of γ-globin mRNA in HUDEP-2, leading to elevated γ-globin protein levels and F cell numbers in CD34<sup>+</sup> bone marrow (BM)‒derived hematopoietic cells. Kinetic studies using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis suggested that compound 16g interacts with G9a via a unique binding mode, as indicated by the markedly higher dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) compared to those of compounds 8 and 9. Interestingly, X-ray crystallographic studies revealed that the binding motif of compound 16g was quite different from our previous series, including RK-701, and somewhat resembles that of endogenous substrates. Insights obtained in this lead optimization exercise on the association/dissociation constants as well as the binding motifs are expected to help in designing future G9a inhibitors for the treatment of sickle cell disease."

Algorithms collected from children's hospitals across the country were compared with recommendations made by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute 2014 and the American Society of Hematology 2020 regarding management of VOC/ACS in SCD. Review of 37 VOC and 17 ACS algorithms from 40 children's hospitals showed that most followed national guidelines for diagnostic evaluation of VOC/ACS. Parenteral opioids and NSAIDs were recommended by all VOC algorithms, with variations in dosing and administration. Intranasal fentanyl was recommended by 31 algorithms. Incentive spirometry was included in 16 of 17 ACS algorithms, but only in 11 of 37 VOC algorithms. Antibiotics were recommended by all ACS algorithms, but 4 used regimens were different from national recommendations. Most ACS algorithms had recommendations regarding transfusion, but with considerable variability. Intravenous fluid management strategies were highly variable, and hypotonic fluids were recommended in 6 VOC and 4 ACS algorithms. Overall, internal algorithms for pediatric SCD showed variability compared with each other and with national guidelines, likely due to the lack of robust evidence supporting specific recommendations."

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a chronic blood disorder that disrupts multiple organ systems and can lead to severe morbidity. Persistent and acute symptoms caused by immune system dysregulation in individuals with SCD could contribute to disease either directly or indirectly via dysbiosis of commensal microbes and increased susceptibility to infection. Here, we explored the nasal and oral microbiomes of children with SCD (cwSCD) to uncover potential dysbiotic associations with the blood disorder. Microbiota collected from nasal and oral swabs of 40 cwSCD were compared to eight healthy siblings using shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Commensal taxa were present at similar levels in the nasal and oral microbiome of both groups. However, the nasal microbiomes of cwSCD contained a higher prevalence of Pseudomonadota species, including pathobionts such as <i>Yersinia enterocolitica</i> and <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i>. Furthermore, the oral microbiome of cwSCD displayed lower α-diversity and fewer commensal and pathobiont species compared to the healthy siblings. Thus, subtle but notable shifts seem to exist in the nasal and oral microbiomes of cwSCD, suggesting an interaction between SCD and the microbiome that may influence health outcomes. The oral and nasal cavities are susceptible to environmental exposures including pathogenic microbes. In individuals with systemic disorders, antibiotic exposure, changes to the immune system, or changes to organ function could influence the composition of the microbes at these sites and the overall health of individuals. Children with sickle cell disease (SCD) commonly experience respiratory infections, such as pneumonia or sinusitis, and may have increased susceptibility to infection because of disrupted microbiota at these body sites. We found that children with SCD (cwSCD) had more pathobiont bacteria in the nasal cavity and reduced bacterial diversity in the oral cavity compared to their healthy siblings. Defining when, why, and how these changes occur in cwSCD could help identify specific microbial signatures associated with susceptibility to infection or adverse outcomes, providing insights into personalized treatment strategies and preventive measures."

    "title": "Acceptability of Newborn Screening for Sickle Cell Disease Among Pregnant Women in Bukavu, Democratic Republic of the Congo: Factors Associated With Uptake and Implications for Public Health.",
    "abstract": "<b>Introduction:</b> Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a serious genetic disorder, often diagnosed early, which can lead to significant complications. Although newborn screening (NBS) for SCD is an effective intervention for reducing the impact of SCD in developed countries, it remains poorly accessible in sub-Saharan Africa, where the disease is particularly prevalent. This study assessed the acceptability of NBS and the factors influencing it among pregnant women in Bukavu, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. <b>Methods:</b> A survey of pregnant women in Bukavu was conducted between December 1, 2023, and January 31, 2024. Data were collected using a semi-structured questionnaire covering sociodemographic characteristics, knowledge, and attitudes toward NBS. Multiple logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with NBS acceptability. <b>Results:</b> Out of a total of 350 respondents approached, 300 voluntarily agreed to answer our questionnaire, resulting in a response rate of 85.7%. Among them, the acceptability rate of NBS was 80.0%. Logistic regression analysis indicated that recognizing SCD as a blood disorder was strongly linked to the acceptability of NBS (adjusted OR = 2.6; 95% CI [1.4-4.9], <i>p</i>=0.002). In addition, individuals who were aware that SCD could be diagnosed at any point in life were more inclined to accept NBS (adjusted OR = 2.0; 95% CI [1.1-3.8], <i>p</i>=0.024). There were no significant associations observed with age, marital status, educational level, professional occupation, religion, knowledge of electrophoretic status, and awareness that SCD can be diagnosed in the neonatal period, or awareness that SCD can be diagnosed at any other time in life. <b>Conclusion:</b> This study demonstrates a significant level of acceptability of NBS among pregnant women in Bukavu, which is influenced by their understanding of SCD and knowledge about diagnostic possibilities. Implementing awareness-raising initiatives focused on key topics, such as the benefits of NBS, the implications of early diagnosis, the availability of follow-up care, increasing knowledge about SCD as a blood disorder, and its potential for diagnosis at any stage of life, could further enhance acceptability."

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic blood disorder causing red blood cells to deform into a sickle shape, often leading to misdiagnosis. Early detection is crucial, but traditional screening is slow and labor-intensive. This paper introduces an intelligent microscope system for automated SCD screening, reducing manual intervention. The system uses an interferometric method to capture high-resolution 3D phase images, combined with a deep learning-based UNET model for semantic segmentation of sickle and healthy cells. Various machine-learning models classify RBCs, with the Gradient boosting model achieving 94.9% accuracy. The system is scalable, user-friendly, and well suited for resource-limited settings, offering a faster, more reliable diagnostic tool. This innovation not only improves SCD detection but also sets the stage for AI-driven haematological diagnostics. Future advancements will enhance system robustness and undergo extensive clinical validation."

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a group of recessive diseases caused by the β<sup>S</sup> sickling mutation of <i>HBB</i> in homozygosity or in compound heterozygosity with other pathogenic <i>HBB</i> mutations. Patients with severe SCD typically experience painful vaso-occlusive crises and other pain-related phenomena, including acute chest syndrome, priapism, dactylitis, avascular necrosis, and splenic sequestration and infarction. High variability of pain-related phenomena per SCD genotype indicates genetic disease modifiers (GDMs) as pathology determinants and, thus, as critical to prognosis, treatment choice, and therapy development. Articles likely holding genetic information for SCD pain phenomena were identified in PubMed and SCOPUS for article quality assessment and extraction of corresponding GDMs and observations indicative of development areas in our understanding of SCD GDMs. This process led to the initial selection of 183 articles matching the search terms, which, after two-step selection, resulted in the inclusion of 100 articles for content analysis and of significant findings for GDMs from 37 articles. Published data point to gender effects and to 51 GDM SNVs, deletions, and regions, including globin genes and significant overrepresentation of gene ontology pathways related, e.g., to oxidative stress, hypoxia, and regulation of blood pressure. Analyzed articles further pointed to additional candidate GDMs affecting SCD VOC and pain phenomena and to potential confounding factors for GWAS analyses. We found that despite the critical importance of VOC and pain phenomena for SCD pathology, corresponding clinically relevant genetic insights are held back by a shortage of large-scale, systematic multi-ethnic efforts, as undertaken by the INHERENT Network."

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a monogenic blood disorder characterized by abnormal hemoglobin S production, which polymerizes under hypoxia conditions to produce chronic red blood cell hemolysis, widespread organ damage, and vasculopathy. As a result of vaso-occlusion and ischemia-reperfusion injury, individuals with SCD have recurrent pain episodes, infection, pulmonary disease, and fall victim to early death. Oxidative stress due to chronic hemolysis and the release of hemoglobin and free heme is a key driver of the clinical manifestations of SCD. The net result is the generation of reactive oxygen species that consume nitric oxide and overwhelm the antioxidant system due to a reduction in enzymes such as superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase. The primary mechanism for handling cellular oxidative stress is the activation of antioxidant proteins by the transcription factor NRF2, a promising target for treatment development, given the significant role of oxidative stress in the clinical severity of SCD. In this review, we discuss the role of oxidative stress in health and the clinical complications of SCD, and the potential of NRF2 as a treatment target, offering hope for developing effective therapies for SCD. This task requires our collective dedication and focus."

    "title": "\"It's like going through life at a mediocre level\": a qualitative study of the meaning and impact of fatigue in children and young people with sickle cell disease.",
    "abstract": "Fatigue is increasingly recognised as a prevalent and debilitating symptom for children and young people (CYP) with long-term conditions (LTCs), significantly affecting their family, social and educational participation. In sickle cell disease (SCD), fatigue is the most frequently reported symptom, surpassing pain related to vaso-occlusion. However, understanding of fatigue's nature and impact on CYP with SCD remains limited. This qualitative study explores the meaning and consequences of fatigue for CYP with SCD to inform services, treatments and care. This exploratory research interviewed 12 CYP with SCD aged 12-23 years, five parents and ten healthcare professionals across England. Participants were recruited through convenience sampling from an NHS Trust, SCD-focused charities and social media. Data were generated using audio-recorded online semi-structured or art-elicitation interviews. Interviews were transcribed and analysed using coding, constant comparison and thematic categorisation to identify key themes. Six thematic categories were constructed from the data: (1) constant state of reduced energy, (2) the daily struggle, (3) the invisibility of fatigue, (4) being socially isolated, (5) managing fatigue, and (6) the future while negotiating fatigue. SCD fatigue was seen as a persistent, inescapable daily struggle, with reduced energy for day-to-day activities. This was often unnoticed or misunderstood by others. It hindered YP's daily routines, caused frequent school absences, reduced social participation, and promoted social exclusion. To meet social expectations and avoid stigma, CYP described constantly pushing themselves to conceal their fatigue, exacerbating their difficulties with SCD. Fatigue was invisible in clinical settings, leading to a lack of standardised/formalised support and increasing uncertainties and precarity about the future. CYP and parents employed energy economisation and recharging strategies to cope with and control fatigue. Fatigue dominates CYP's experience of living with SCD, significantly impacting their physical, social and educational functioning and leading to isolation and stigma. Often overlooked in clinical settings, addressing fatigue should be integral to SCD care and research. This includes incorporating fatigue assessments, developing targeted self-management programmes, and furthering research on its management. The findings emphasise recognising fatigue as a primary symptom in CYP with LTCs, given its severe impact on social and educational development and future stability. Not Applicable."

Using murine and humanized SCD models, we found that disrupted chromosomal interactions in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells reduced the expression of anti-ferroptotic genes, including SLC7A11 and hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) biogenesis genes, thereby increasing susceptibility to ferroptosis. Therapeutic restoration of H<sub>2</sub>S concentration in SCD mice rescued SLC7A11 expression, mitigated ferroptosis, and enhanced immune and anti-tumor responses.

As a result, hemoglobin S production occurs leading to clinical symptoms including vaso-occlusive pain, organ damage, and a shortened lifespan. Hydroxyurea is the only FDA-approved fetal hemoglobin (HbF) inducer in the United States that ameliorates the clinical severity of SCD. Due to challenges with hydroxyurea, our study aimed to address the unmet need for the development of non-chemotherapeutic HbF inducers. We investigated the ability of CT-101, a Class 1 histone deacetylase inhibitor, to flip the γ-globin to β-globin switch in a humanized SCD mouse model. Pharmacokinetic parameters were assessed in CD-1 and Townes SCD mice after a single intraperitoneal drug dose. Similar drug uptake and half-life were observed in both animals. Subsequent studies in β-YAC mice expressing human γ-globin and β-globin genes established the optimal dose of CT-101 that induces HbF without peripheral blood toxicity. Subsequent confirmatory studies were conducted in the SCD mouse treated with intraperitoneal CT-101, demonstrating increases in F-cells, HbF, and γ-globin gene mRNA levels. Hydroxyurea combined with CT-101 significantly decreased spleen size and hemorrhagic infarcts and improved splenic extramedullary hematopoiesis. Our novel agent, CT-101, flipped the switch by activating γ-globin gene transcription and HbF protein synthesis in the preclinical SCD mouse model without significant toxicity in the peripheral blood. These findings support the development of an oral CT-101 formulation for clinical testing in SCD."

Multiple mechanisms including anemia, hypercoagulability, secondary moyamoya syndrome, paradoxical embolism, and platelet activation are implicated in the pathogenesis of stroke in SCA. Despite a paucity of literature on the safety or efficacy of antithrombotic therapies, these agents are used in patients with SCA for primary and secondary stroke prevention. This study examined the prevalence of antithrombotic usage in the SCA-Stroke arm of the Patent Foramen Ovale and Stroke (PFAST) study cohort. Approximately 46.5% (72/155) of patients report using antithrombotic medications. The frequency of antithrombotic medications increased with recurrent strokes: 39.6% (42/106) of patients were on antithrombotic medications after a single stroke, while 61.2% (30/49) of patients were on medications after a recurrent stroke. Within this population, 42.6% (66/155) were on antiplatelet medications, and only 4.5% (7/155) were on anticoagulants. Factors significantly associated with increased usage of antithrombotic therapy were the absence acute chest syndrome and higher baseline hemoglobin concentrations. While the majority of patients were taking antithrombotic therapies for secondary stroke prevention, a minority of patients were taking medications for other indications such as headache prophylaxis and prior venous sinus thrombosis. Given these current clinical practice patterns and prevalent use, further research is needed to define the role of antithrombotic agents in pediatric SCA. There appears to be clinical equipoise for the use of these agents in the SCA and pediatric stroke population."

There was excellent agreement between MRI and CT, with an ICC of 0.978 (0.967-0.985 at 95% confidence interval; <i>p</i> < .001). There was also substantial agreement between MRI and CT in the evaluation of sinus calcifications or hyperdense material, with a Cohen kappa value of 0.8 (<i>p</i> < .001).ConclusionBrain MRI is probably sufficient for assessing PNS disease in SCD patients before stem cell transplantation. Given its effectiveness in detecting sinus disease and silent infarcts without the added risks of radiation, MRI is the preferred and most resource-efficient imaging approach."

    "abstract": "Extracellular heme, released during intravascular hemolysis in sickle cell disease (SCD) and hemolytic anemia acts as a pro-inflammatory danger signal, requiring robust defense mechanisms. Previous studies identified GPCR signaling triggered by heme, but the specific receptor remained unknown. Transcriptomic analysis of bulk RNAseq of liver tissues from SCD and hemolytic mice (injection of phenylhydrazine) revealed GPCR signaling as a commonly enriched pathway. Unbiased screening of 241 GPCRs identified Hydroxycarboxylic Acid Receptor 2 (HCAR2/GPR109A), an anti-inflammatory receptor for niacin, as a novel heme sensor. Heme binding to human HCAR2 was validated using a functional reporter cell assay and direct interaction analyses via surface plasmon resonance and absorbance spectroscopy. In vivo, HCAR2 was upregulated in the liver of SCD and hemolytic mice, paralleling the expression of the heme-degrading enzyme heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). HO-1 inhibition or heme injection further increased HCAR2 expression, indicating that heme acts as both a ligand and an inducer of HCAR2. These findings identify HCAR2 as a novel heme receptor and reveal a heme-HCAR2-HO-1 negative feedback loop, involved in tissue protection in hemolytic diseases."

    "abstract": "Hereditary diseases, particularly genetic blood disorders such as Sickle Cell Disease (SCD), Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, and Thalassemia, pose significant public health challenges. Premarital carrier screening (PMCS) is a critical preventive measure, yet its uptake remains low in many regions, including the Ahafo Region of Ghana. This study assessed young adults' knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) regarding PMCS for SCD, G6PD deficency, and Thalassemia and determined factors associated with these KAP outcomes in the Ahafo Region. A cross-sectional study was conducted from January to March 2024, involving 460 young adults aged 18-35 years attending various health facilities in the Ahafo Region. Data were collected using a validated structured questionnaire, translated into the local dialect for clarity. The questionnaire covered socio-demographic information, knowledge of PMCS, attitudes towards PMCS, and PMCS practices. Data were analysed using Stata version 14, with descriptive statistics, Chi-square tests for associations, and logistic regression to identify significant predictors of KAP. The study population was predominantly female (85.7%), with a mean age of 24.7 years. Only 15.4% (n = 71) of respondents demonstrated good knowledge of PMCS. Key factors influencing knowledge included female gender, age 26-35 years, tertiary education, and receiving information from healthcare services. Positive attitudes towards PMCS were observed in 66.7% of respondents, significantly associated with tertiary education, self-employment, unemployment, and cohabiting marital status. However, only 14.1% exhibited positive PMCS practices, with significant predictors being tertiary education and being married. These findings indicate a substantial gap between awareness and actual practice of PMCS. This study underscores the urgent need for targeted educational interventions and policy measures to enhance PMCS uptake among young adults in the Ahafo Region. Improving healthcare communication, integrating PMCS education into tertiary curricula, addressing sociocultural barriers, and enacting supportive policies are essential steps. Engaging various stakeholders, including healthcare providers, educational institutions, community leaders, policymakers, and NGOs, is crucial for effectively translating positive attitudes into proactive practices and reducing the prevalence of genetic blood disorders in the Ahafo Region and Ghana as a whole."

    "abstract": "Erythrocytes, as the predominant cellular components within the bloodstream, are crucial for the maintenance of physiological health. Mitochondria, known as cellular powerhouses and metabolic regulators, play a critical role in the maturation of the erythroid lineage. The absence of mitochondria in red blood cells upon completing their maturation process is a defining characteristic of their development. Dysregulation of mitochondrial metabolism has been associated with the onset and progression of various diseases. Mitochondrial metabolic disorders, along with the involvement of mitochondria in the induction of oxidative stress and the activation of immune responses, significantly contribute to the pathogenesis of diverse hematologic disorders, particularly in sickle cell disease. This review offers a comprehensive overview of the role of mitochondria in disorders related to abnormal erythropoiesis, immune responses, and hemolysis, as well as evaluating potential therapeutic strategies that target mitochondria. Ultimately, we emphasize the necessity for future research to elucidate the involvement of mitochondria in red blood cell disorders, which may inform the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches."

    "abstract": "Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is a genetic hematological disorder characterized by chronic pain, recurrent vaso-occlusive crises featuring extremely painful episodes, and other co-morbidities. Management of pain in SCD relies on persistent and/or high doses of opioids as the mainstay, which is known to be associated with significant risks of side effects, tolerance, opioid-induced hyperalgesia, and/or lower quality of life (QoL). Moreover, many SCD individuals self-manage their pain at home, which further increases the potential risks of abuse and side effects of medications. Preliminary results from our ongoing RCT demonstrate the feasibility and efficacy of self-administered acupressure as a new telehealth approach in SCD for managing pain and co-morbidities ( ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT06511453 ). Twenty-three participants with SCD receiving self-administered acupressure every other day for five weeks plus usual care showed progressive (weekly observation during the treatment period) and sustained (monthly observation up to 6 months following the last treatment) improvements in pain, co-morbidities (e.g., physical dysfunction, fatigue, sleep disturbance, and emotional distress) and QoL as compared to the 14 participants with SCD receiving usual care alone. No significant improvements were observed throughout the observational period in individuals with usual care only. No side effects were reported from the participants receiving self-administered acupressure. These results highlight acupressure's potential as a safe and effective telehealth approach for managing pain in SCD. A larger sample size from continuous enrollment is needed to validate these findings."

There is limited literature on the prevalence rate of psychological symptoms among these children in Uganda. We aimed to assess the health-related psychological distress and associated factors among children with SCD in an urban tertiary health facility in Uganda. A descriptive, cross-sectional study was conducted in Mulago National Referral Hospital (MNRH) Kampala, Uganda, including children with SCD aged 7 to 17 years attending inpatient and outpatient departments of sickle cell unit. Psychological distress was assessed using distress questionnaire 5 (DQ-5). We also used the Child behavioral questionnaire in a Paper based form for data collection. A total of 288 children were included in this study. Their mean age was 12.0±3.6 years. Majority of the children were female (52.4%, n=151), in primary schools (66.3%, n=191) and lived with their mothers only (51.0%, n=147). The prevalence of psychological distress was 34.0% (n=98). Children aged 11 to 17 years were more likely to have psychological distress when compared to those aged 7 to 10 years [Adjusted Odd Ration (aOR): 1.8, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.1 - 3.1, p= 0.029]. Almost every 1 in 3 children with SCD in Uganda has psychological distress. There is a great need for interventions to support the psychological needs of this population of children. Therefore, by fostering understanding and providing appropriate support, it is possible to mitigate the negative psychological impact and promote resilience in these young patients."

    "abstract": "The most prevalent genetic disease in Africa and sub-Saharan Africa is sickle cell disease. Crisis often leads to severe pain in the limbs and chest region accompanied by oxygen deprivation to tissues. In children and adults, acute chest syndrome (ACS) which is a complication of vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC), is a life-threatening condition. A 24-year-old female with known Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) complained of generalized diffuse chest pains and was administered diclofenac at a peripheral hospital. The pains subsided. However, the condition relapsed and at another clinic, she was treated with <i>i.v</i>. paracetamol, morphine, pethidine, and <i>i.v</i>. fluids. Three (3) days had already gone by since the crisis started before a further transfer was made to the Greater Accra Regional Hospital. On arrival, she was diagnosed with chest and leg pains, shortness of breath, and VOC. Chest x-ray demonstrated patchy consolidation, infiltrates bilaterally, with right atrial enlargement. Clexane 80 mg BD, <i>i.v.</i> Omeprazole 40 mg <i>b.d</i>., Azithromycin tablets 500 mg, morphine syrup 10 mg/5 mL, Injection Rocephin 2 g, and infusion paracetamol 1 g were administered, followed by a continuous treatment review plan. Oxygen saturation was however generally constant at 99%. On day five (post admission-D5) the patient was moaning and restless. Her WBC started increasing [5.9-10.1 × 10<sup>3</sup>/μL (D5-D9)], platelets were still low (45 × 10<sup>3</sup>/μL), with Hb showing signs of fluctuations [6.3-9.0 g/dL (D2-D9)]. Blood culture results showed Gram-positive bacillus. Acute phase reactants, CRP (103.65 mg/dL) and ferritin (741.3 μg/L) were very high. RBC exchange transfusion by apheresis commenced at 10 pm (for 3 h). By 6 am the following day, the patient was described as having a calm night. Further drug modifications were made and by day 9 (D9) patient was only on Cap Omeprazole 20 mg once for 5 days, and tab dexamethasone 6 mg daily. The patient was discharged on day 11 post admission. Thus, from the onset of the crisis to the application of apheresis, 8 days had elapsed. However, five (5) hours after the RBC exchange transfusion by apheresis, pains subsided considerably. The key clinical message is that prompt resolution of ACS by therapeutic apheresis application will subsequently reduce the long-term pulmonary complications in SCD patients, hospitalization time, the overall financial burden, anxiety, and discomfort to patient and family."

    "title": "Venous thromboembolism with contraceptive use in females with sickle cell trait.",
    "abstract": "Sickle cell trait is the carrier state for sickle cell disease and occurs in 1 in 13 births in Black and African American families. Individuals with sickle cell trait are permitted to serve in the military. Some research studies have shown that individuals with sickle cell trait may be at increased risk for thromboembolic events. Contraceptive use, specifically combined hormonal contraceptives containing both estrogen and progesterone, has been linked to an increased risk of thromboembolic events. No research has been done to determine if there is an increased risk of venous thromboembolism in a population of females with sickle cell trait who do or do not take combined hormonal contraceptives. To determine if women with sickle cell trait who use combined hormonal contraceptives are at higher risk for venous thromboembolism compared with females with sickle cell trait who do not use combined hormonal contraceptives. Given the increased risk of venous thromboembolism in sickle cell trait individuals in the general population, we hypothesized that females with sickle cell trait exposed to combined hormonal contraceptives would experience higher venous thromboembolism rates than unexposed females with sickle cell trait. Population-based retrospective cohort study of females with sickle cell trait identified from the Military Data Repository to evaluate venous thromboembolism after exposure to combined hormonal contraceptives or without exposure to combined hormonal contraceptives. There were 15,440 unique females aged 18-44 years between 2005 and 2021 who had a diagnosis of sickle cell trait. Approximately 40% of females had an International Classification of Diseases code consistent with a prescription of a combined hormonal contraceptive. Thirty-three (0.2%) of the 15,440 females with sickle cell trait had experienced venous thromboembolism of any type. There was no difference in the prevalence of venous thromboembolism by combined hormonal contraceptive use (yes [0.18%] vs no [0.24%]; <i>P</i>=.454). Being older, married, nonactive-duty military status, smoking, and having a diagnosis of hypertension were associated with a higher prevalence of venous thromboembolism. Although there was a small number of venous thromboembolism events, the findings of this study suggest that the use of combined hormonal contraceptives in females with sickle cell trait is not associated with a detectable signal for increased venous thromboembolism risk as an outcome. Given the potential clinical benefit of combined hormonal contraceptives in pregnancy prevention and menstrual regulation in females, the concerns about combined hormonal contraceptive-associated venous thromboembolism in this population with sickle cell trait seem to be minimal."

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is among the most prevalent genetic disorders worldwide. It is characterized by unpredictable and potentially fatal vaso-occlusive crises, directly linked to the stiffening of red blood cells (RBCs) due to the formation of hemoglobin fibers in their cytoplasm. Here, we propose a new mechanical marker: the proportion of RBCs in a blood sample deformable enough to exhibit a specific tank-treading motion, in shear flow at a given shear rate. This marker is significantly lower in SCD patients than in controls and is sensitive to RBC density and dehydration, two factors that influence hemoglobin polymerization in SCD. The marker was tested in a cohort of 21 SCD patients, with weekly monitoring conducted over a period of 6 months. It correlates with key biological parameters of SCD including fetal hemoglobin levels, reticulocyte count, serum LDH levels, and the use of antihypertensive treatments. The marker significantly decreases before vaso-occlusive crises requiring hospitalization. These findings indicate that this marker may act as a comprehensive indicator of RBC deformability, offering valuable insights for the continuous clinical monitoring of SCD patients. It could play a role in managing or preventing vaso-occlusive crises and holds potential for the development of new diagnostic tests such as point-of-care or companion diagnostic devices for personalized medicine."

However, the specific phytochemicals responsible for the observed therapeutic effects remain unclear. This study aims to characterize the aqueous leaf extract of <i>H. tiliaceus</i> and assess its biological activity against sickle cell disease, including its antisickling, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory effects. Using techniques such as TLC, HPLC-UV/DAD, LC-MS, and NMR, we identified kaempferol 3-<i>O</i>-rutinoside and rutin in the aqueous extract of <i>H. tiliaceus</i> leaves. Rutin exhibited potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities, with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 5 µg/mL and 2.5 µg/mL, respectively. Conversely, kaempferol 3-<i>O</i>-rutinoside demonstrated superior antisickling activity, normalizing sickled red blood cells with an IC<sub>50</sub> < 12.5 µg/mL. Due to the pathophysiology of SCD, which involves the polymerization of red blood cells, which induces oxidative stress and an inflammatory response, this study suggests the importance of <i>H. tiliaceus</i> for the management of SCD. Additionally, the combined effect of molecules in <i>H. tiliaceus</i> will help in normalizing erythrocytes, inhibiting free radicals generated by early hemolysis, thus contributing to inflammatory processes reduction. This finding provides evidence and validates the traditional use of <i>H. tiliaceus</i> aqueous extract for the management of SCD."

    "abstract": "One ongoing debate in orthopaedic surgery concerns using tourniquets in sickle cell trait (SCT) patients. SCT, a heterozygous carrier state of sickle cell disease (SCD), affects an estimated 300 million individuals globally with various genetic ancestries. A retrospective cohort study was conducted on 940 SCT patients and 1263 matched non-SCT controls who underwent limb surgeries using tourniquets between 1978 and 2018. Patient data were gathered from hospital records, blood bank information, and postoperative haemoglobin electrophoresis. Outcomes assessed included the incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE), pulmonary embolism (PE), phlebitis, peripheral nerve impairment, and superficial infection. Covariates included age, sex, ethnicity, and diabetes status. Among SCT patients, 75% were unaware of their carrier status at surgery. VTE incidence was significantly higher in SCT patients (10%) than non-SCT controls (2%), especially after prolonged tourniquet use and in upper limb procedures without anticoagulation. PE occurred in 3% of SCT patients, versus 1% in controls. Diabetes, more prevalent in SCT individuals (9% vs. 6%), further increased the complication risk. Tourniquet inflation time did not differ significantly between groups; however, neurologic complications and phlebitis were more common in SCT patients, particularly those with Mediterranean ancestry. Notably, SCT carriers of African and Mediterranean descent experienced higher complication rates than non-carriers, though complications were not confined to any single ancestry. SCT is associated with an increased risk of thrombotic and neurologic complications during tourniquet, particularly in patients with undiagnosed SCT or diabetes and in procedures with extended ischaemia time. These results confirm the perception of SCT as a benign condition, but call for further clinical guidelines regarding tourniquet use in SCT carriers."

While the pathogenesis of ACS is incompletely understood, endothelial damage and microvascular occlusion are critical components. Our previous studies have implicated small extracellular vesicles in the plasma of subjects with SCD in causing endothelial dysfunction. This suggested that microRNAs within these small EVs might be responsible for endothelial damage. The sequencing of microRNAs in small EVs from the plasma of subjects with SCD revealed that several miRNAs were differentially expressed between subjects with and without ACS history, including let-7c-5p. In a replication cohort, plasma let-7c-5p levels were quantified via RT-qPCR. The baseline plasma let-7c-5p level was twofold higher in patients without previous ACS. Furthermore, we observed a positive correlation between let-7c-5p levels and time to subsequent ACS events. These findings suggest a role for let-7c-5p in endothelial disruption underlying ACS pathogenesis. It may also serve as a novel biomarker for ACS detection and the prediction of disease progression."

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited hemoglobin disorder that is widespread across the globe. It is characterized by a very complex pathogenesis, but at the basis of the disease is the mutation of the HBB gene, which determines the production of a mutated hemoglobin: sickle cell hemoglobin (HbS). The polymerization of HbS, which occurs when the protein is in a deoxygenated state, and the greater fragility of sickle cell red blood cells (sRBCs) determine the release of iron, free heme, and HbS in the blood, favoring oxidative stress and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). These features are common to the features of a new model of cell death known as ferroptosis, which is characterized by the increase of iron and ROS concentrations and by the inhibition of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPx4) and the System Xc<sup>-</sup>. In this context, this review aims to discuss the potential molecular and biochemical pathways of ferroptosis involved in SCD, aiming to highlight possible tags involved in treating the disease and inhibiting ferroptosis."

However, most LSD1 inhibitors (LSD1i) that induce HbF in vivo are covalent and irreversible, which leads to adverse effects. In this study, we utilized structure-aided drug design to develop potent new reversible LSD1i's leading to robust γ-globin expression in vitro. Moreover, in a mouse model of SCD, oral administration of these novel inhibitors lead to significant HbF elevation and alleviation of multiple features of disease pathology that are the usual consequences of SCD. In addition, we discovered that combined treatment of an LSD1i with a BRD4 degrader (BD-9136) represses the induction of RUNX1 and PU.1, thereby rescuing the erythroid to myeloid lineage conversion that accompanies LSD1i in hematopoiesis. The data indicate that this new generation of LSD1i can effectively induce HbF levels, reduce SCD pathologies, and are well-tolerated by oral administration in SCD mice. We anticipate that the combination of these or related binary compounds offer exciting new therapeutic possibilities for treating SCD and TM."

Hydroxyurea (HU) use was highest in Ghana (21%), followed by Nigeria (12%) and Tanzania (6%), with significant variability across facilities. Sex differences in SCD management were observed, with males more likely to receive HU and blood transfusions. At the consortium level, HU initiation correlated with enrolment age rather than age at diagnosis, highlighting the need for earlier intervention.

As the prevalence of SCD in Australia rises due to migration, discussions surrounding treatment and management strategies are becoming more prominent. Australia lacks a dedicated study on the prevalence and economic implications of SCD. In this study, we estimate the economic burden of SCD in Australia from the perspective of the Australian healthcare system. We performed a cost-of-illness study by using a bottom-up approach to estimate resource use per patient from a national registry with unit costs from national sources, and a top-down estimate of the prevalence of SCD in Australia using stratification by ancestry. We estimated the prevalence of SCD in Australia in 2021 to be 8485 patients, the cost per patient per year to be AU$13 975 and the total cost to the Australian healthcare system to be approximately AU$119 million per year. Factors influencing costs were age, interventions and frequency of hospital visits for vaso-occlusive crises. Prevalence had the greatest influence on results in the sensitivity analysis. While the estimated prevalence of SCD in Australia resulted in a relatively small total cost, the per patient annual cost of SCD remains high. This cost of SCD is anticipated to increase alongside migration and improved treatment. There are policies that could enhance patients' quality of life, thereby mitigating both economic and health burdens."

Nearly all families were likely to recommend the SCSC (90.1%). Given the neurocognitive impact and known disparities in educational resources, patients with SCD are at a unique risk for differences in learning. Literacy promotion is imperative to child development and a chronic disease subspecialty clinic offers a unique opportunity to address this domain."

Of 293 enrolled participants, 284 remained active in the study, and 206 (72.5%) completed the 24-week MARS survey. App Interest was positively correlated with app use (p = 0.01) and self-reported days of app use (p = 0.0008). Perceived ease of use trended toward significance with greater app use (p = 0.06). Most individuals (72.0%, 144/200) agreed the app helped them remember to take hydroxyurea, with trends toward higher days of app use (p = 0.07). Those who used the app more agreed they would continue to use it after the study (p = 0.04). Most individuals (54.3%) reported that reminders to take their hydroxyurea were the most important app feature. In this study, positive perceptions toward the application features influenced app use and intention to continue using the application. Determining features that drive application utilization can have a positive impact when an app, such as the InCharge app, is demonstrated to improve adherence with proven therapy."

Current research/treatment strategies have focused on HbSS-SCD, while HbSC patients are deprived of disease-modifying/transformative therapies due to lack of preclinical models. We generated HbSC mice, which resemble human HbSC-SCD: HbSC erythrocytes showed marked xerocytosis. Anemia, hemolysis, inflammation and organ damage were milder than HbSS mice, but hypoxia/reperfusion injury was similar. Retinopathy developed at higher frequency than HbSS mice (66.7% versus 16.7%; p<0.05), like HbSC-SCD patients. While HbSC RBCs sickled at lower pO2 than HbSS RBCs (43mmHg versus 24mmHg; P<0.0001), they did not completely recover deformability after hypoxia-reoxygenation. Using the HbSC mice developed herein, we studied the mechanism by which hydroxyurea causes significant clinical benefit in HbSC-SCD patients, despite minimal/modest increases in fetal-hemoglobin (HbF). We found hydroxyurea had distinct non-HbF and HbF effects. Hydroxyurea did not increase HbF in adult HbSC/HbSS mice, but reduced RBC ROS, Ferryl-hemoglobin, Heinz-body formation, thereby reducing membrane damage; however, RBC hydration was unaffected. When given to unborn pups before they switch off g-globin expression and continued postnatally, we could induce HbF in both HbSC/HbSS mice (higher HbF in HbSS versus HbSC mice). Minimal increases in HbF (~1%) improved HbSC RBC hydration. Peak HbF levels of 7% in HbSC mice abrogated sickling. Overall, this HbSC model will help bridge the knowledge-gap in mechanistic/therapeutic studies in this neglected disease."

    "abstract": "Severe chronic noncommunicable diseases pose a significant health burden and challenges for health systems globally. This study aims to advance our understanding of the current organization of care for these conditions in low and lower-middle-income countries. The study was conducted as part of a baseline assessment of facilities prior to the initiation of the Package of Essential NCD Interventions -Plus (PEN-Plus) strategy, which is designed to enhance outpatient care for conditions including rheumatic and congenital heart disease, sickle cell disease, type 1 diabetes, severe asthma, and advanced chronic kidney disease. We employed a cross-sectional survey methodology to collect baseline data from 16 hospitals in nine LLMICs. The survey assessed the organization of common and severe NCD services, focusing on the availability and management of severe NCDs, organized into domains of integrated services. Data were analyzed using summary statistics and heatmaps to evaluate care patterns. We document gaps in the availability of services for both common and severe NCDs. We find that the majority of NCD care occurs in the general outpatient settings, with a smaller proportion provided in specialized internal medicine wards. Despite some hospitals implementing specialized clinics and teams, limitations in specialist access, variability in service fees, and inconsistent definitions of patient follow-up were prominent issues affecting patient care access and continuity. Despite the spectrum of strategies employed by these hospitals to cater to chronically and severely ill patients, notable gaps in care persist, particularly for diagnostic and treatment options that require specialist training or equipment. The sustainable decentralization of effective care for individuals with severe chronic NCDs will require integrated teams and customized systems to ensure seamless and comprehensive care through the entire care continuum-from screening and diagnosis to care linkage, ongoing management, handling of complications, uninterrupted supply of medicines and commodities and maintaining patient retention."

    "abstract": "Most of the current treatment modalities for sickle hemoglobinopathy are disease-modifying rather than curative. Therefore, there is a need for effective treatment of complications of sickle cell disease (SCD) that impair quality of life. This need drives the evaluation of preclinical therapeutics in search of new treatment modalities. Interventions are likely to progress from research to clinical practice, their potential impact, and future directions in SCD care: HbF inducers, pyruvate kinase activators, anti-selectin P monoclonal antibodies, allosteric Hb modifiers, proactive treatment of cerebral artery conditional blood velocity, multimodal, and gene therapy. Established treatment modalities (e.g with hydroxyurea) are not included because these have advanced well beyond the preclinical stage of therapeutics. Information dated 2025 backward was obtained from Medline, PubMed, and other public sources. Places for the conduct of preclinical studies ought to include areas of high SCD prevalence. Limited resources currently hinder universal accessibility of curative SCD therapies in these places. The recent approval of non-viral gene therapy for SCD and the number of preclinical therapeutics in development bring realistic expectation that curative and disease-modifying interventions, such as multimodal therapy and proactive treatment of cerebral artery conditional blood velocity to prevent stroke, will become standard care."

    "abstract": "Introduction Blood transfusion services (BTS) are an integral part of healthcare. In rural areas, the status of BTS has not been properly studied. We conducted this retrospective study to analyse the donor deferral pattern and understand the reasons for deferral in a newly established blood centre at a rural medical college. Methodology This was a retrospective study, where we analysed blood donor deferral data from January 1, 2024, to December 31, 2024. The donor deferral records of both replacement and voluntary donors, maintained in the blood centre, were analysed. Results A total of 4,716 donors were registered. Of these, 322 were deferred due to various reasons, with 70.8% (n = 228) being temporary deferrals and 29.2% (n = 94) being permanent deferrals. Males accounted for 94% (n = 303) and females for 6% (n = 19) of the deferrals. Low haemoglobin (Hb) was the most common reason for temporary deferrals, while hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and syphilis reactivity were the most common reasons for permanent deferral. Conclusion This retrospective analysis of donor deferral patterns in a rural hospital showed low Hb, alcohol intake, and HBsAg reactivity as some common reasons for deferrals. As the region is endemic for sickle cell disease, we recommend the inclusion of sickle cell testing in donor screening, as well as efforts to improve the overall health of the rural population."

The aim of this article was to desribe a very rare case of plastic bronchitis caused by group C streptococcus (GCS) as a pathogen causing PB. A 5-year-old girl with no known underlying chronic diseases presented in October 2022 with a moderate-grade fever, dyspnea, and a productive cough of 3-months' duration On physical examination, she was slightly tachypneic with an oxygen saturation of 98%, but there were no other significant findings. Initial imaging studies, including a chest X-ray (CXR) and a two-dimensional echocardiogram, were normal. Most cases of PB result from procedures to repair congenital heart diseases, although other etiologies have been identified, including infections, inflammatory processes, and acute chest syndrome of sickle cell disease. The incidence of pulmonary infection associated with PB has increased over the years, primarily due to adenovirus, influenza viruses, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influen zae. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first case report describing group C streptococ cus (GCS) as a pathogen causing PB. To the authors' knowledge, this is the irst case report describing group C streptococcus (GCS) as a pathogen causing PB."

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an autosomal recessive disorder of blood characterized by a mutation in the β chain of hemoglobin (Hb), leading to the production of sickle Hb (HbS). In SCD, under low oxygen conditions, red blood cells (RBCs) containing HbS form a characteristic \"sickle\" shape, resulting in chronic hemolytic anemia and acute vaso-occlusive crises. Current therapies for SCD have limitations in efficacy or availability, highlighting the need for new anti-sickling drugs. To facilitate the discovery of new anti-sickling compounds, we previously developed a high throughput sickling assay, which permits rapid screening of thousands of compounds for the ability to inhibit RBC sickling. In this study, we improved the sickling assay by optimizing the assay condition and expanded our screening efforts by evaluating the Repurposing, Focused Rescue, and Accelerated Medchem (ReFRAME) compound library, which contains approximately 2.5 times more compounds than previously screened. We were able to increase the number of blood samples that were adequate for identifying anti-sickling compounds in the improved sickling assay and identified voxelotor and SNS-314 as compounds that successfully prevented sickling. The improved sickling assay will increase access to valuable blood samples from SCD volunteers, providing more opportunities to develop anti-sickling compounds for treating SCD."

We previously established that miR-29b induces fetal haemoglobin (HbF) in Townes sickle cell anaemia (SCA) mice using a continuous infusion mini-osmotic pump. Herein, we expanded the scope of our work to determine the ability of intermittent subcutaneous cholesterol-conjugated miR-29b (Chol-miR-29b) to induce HbF expression in SCA mice. Blood was collected for automated complete blood counts with differential, reticulocyte count and γ-globin and β<sup>S</sup>-globin mRNA levels quantified by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR; flow cytometry measured the percentage of HbF-positive cells (F-cells). Methylation assays determined 5-methylcytosine levels, and RNA sequencing changes in gene expression for different treatment conditions. SCA mice receiving Chol-miR-29b exhibited normal behaviour and weight gain without peripheral blood count toxicity. The γ-globin mRNA levels significantly increased, and F-cell percentages were enhanced after Chol-miR-29b treatment. Subsequently, spleen tissue confirmed decreased DNMT3A protein and 5-methylcytosine levels in the γ-globin gene promoter. RNA-seq analysis supports oncogene silencing and tumour suppressor gene activation by Chol-miR-29b. These data demonstrate that a daily subcutaneous dose of Chol-miR-29b induces HbF expression, highlighting its potential for clinical development in SCA."

This cohort study was nested within a clinical trial comparing weekly dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine with the standard of care (monthly sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine) among children with SCA. HRQoL was assessed using EQ-5D tools during steady states and sick attacks. Ordinary least squares regression identified factors associated with HRQoL. A total of 633 children with SCA were enrolled (mean age 8.1 years, standard deviation [SD] 3.7). HRQoL was higher during steady states but deteriorated during sick attacks, with the most problems reported in pain and discomfort. Older children (ages 12-16: mean difference [MD] = 0.09, P < .0001) experienced higher HRQoL during steady states but lower HRQoL during sick attacks. Hospitalization negatively affected HRQoL; children hospitalized 1 to 3 times (MD = -0.27, P = .01) or ≥4 times (MD = -0.24, P = .02) had substantially lower HRQoL. There were no HRQoL differences between treatment arms. The HRQoL of children with SCA was relatively high during steady states but declined substantially during sick attacks, especially because of severe pain and discomfort. HRQoL is influenced by a child's age and frequency of hospitalization. Results provide information for calculation of quality-adjusted life years for future economic evaluation."

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most common genetic hematologic disease globally and children with SCD are at increased risk for pneumococcal disease. We utilized data from population-based enhanced surveillance for invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in children <18 years of age in Massachusetts from 2002 to 2020. We calculated incidence rates (IR) among children with SCD using bootstrapping resampling and incidence rate ratios (IRR) for pre- and post-PCV13 periods. Vaccine effectiveness (VE) was calculated as 100*(1-IRR), and PCV13 vaccine failure probability was predicted using a random forest model. Children with SCD had higher IR during both pre-/post-PCV13 periods compared with otherwise healthy children 240.0/100,000 versus 4.6/100,000 in pre-PCV13 period (2002-2009); 172.7/100,000 versus 1.9/100,000 in post-PCV13 period (2011-2020), respectively. After widespread use of PCV7 for a decade, a modest reduction of 28.1 % (95% CI 25.9-37.2%) in the incidence of overall IPD during the post-PCV13 period was observed in children with SCD, whereas a more substantial 59.5% (96% CI 57.8-61.4%) reduction was observed in otherwise healthy children. There was a 60.8% (95% CI 55.2%-NA) reduction in the incidence of VST13 IPD in children with SCD and an 83.0% (95% CI 80.67-85.63%) reduction in children without underlying health condition. Overall, 61.1% of the remaining IPD among children with SCD were due to non-PCV13 serotypes (8, 10A, 15A,15B, 22F, 23B), many of which are included in expanded valency vaccines. Children with SCD continue to have higher rates of IPD compared with otherwise healthy children despite vaccination. Majority of the remaining disease is due to serotypes not included in vaccine formulations that have been used for the last two decades. Our study highlights the potential value of expanded valency vaccines and importance of risk-based vaccination strategies tailored for this vulnerable population."

Few studies, however, report the associations between emergency department (ED) pain scores, number of ED opioid doses, receipt of an opioid prescription, ED visit disposition, or ED return visits. This seven-site retrospective cohort study analyzed 4983 ED visits by children with SCD pain using electronic health record data from the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network Registry. ED pain scores included initial, last, and change in scores (initial minus last), measured on a 0-10 scale. Dispositions of discharge and hospital admission were included. Modified Poisson regression and the Cochran-Armitage test of trend were used for analysis. The median (IQR) initial pain score was 8.0 (6-10); last pain score was 5.0 (2-8); and median decrease was 2.0 (0-5). In multivariable analysis, last pain score was the best predictor of disposition. For the return visit analyses, of the 2377 visits discharged at index ED visit, 29% returned within 14 days. Higher initial and last ED pain scores were associated with increased return visits. Children with no opioid discharge prescription and ≥3 ED opioid doses had a return visit rate of 36% compared to 22% if the child received an opioid prescription and only one ED opioid. Increasing discharge opioid prescriptions and targeting interventions for those who receive multiple ED opioid doses could decrease return visits."

    "abstract": "Despite sickle cell disease (SCD) being a well-recognized and highly prevalent condition identified early through neonatal screening programs, it represents a substantial public health challenge due to high morbidity and premature mortality rates. Hydroxyurea (HU) is the only available disease-modifying therapy for SCD approved in Brazil. Indeed, its underutilization highlights the need for improved therapeutic strategies to enhance adherence and management of SCD. Innovative formulations of HU might favor treatment adherence and precise dosing. Thus, we aimed to describe HU's pharmacological characteristics, clinical efficacy, and tolerability, including dose escalation. Recent interventional and observational studies revealed the efficacy and safety of an innovative formulation: dispersible scored tablets of 100 mg and 1000 mg, allowing easier dose adjustments and, consequently, more precise dosing. The 100 mg tablets scored can be cut into two parts of 50 mg, and the 1000 mg tablets can be cut into four parts of 250 mg. The fractionating dose is possible due to the formulation technology that allows the tablet to be cut with a uniform amount of drug in each part. This new formulation of HU, suitable for children, may influence the prognosis of SDC, regardless of associated symptoms."

    "abstract": "Iron homeostasis imbalance, caused by conditions such as thalassemia, sickle cell anemia, and myocardial infarction, often results in elevated free iron levels, leading to ferroptosis and severe organ damage. While current iron chelators like deferoxamine (DFO) and deferiprone are effective, they are associated with significant side effects, including nephrotoxicity, gastrointestinal bleeding, and liver fibrosis. This creates an urgent need for safer, natural-product-based alternatives for effective iron chelation therapy (ICT). This study investigates caffeic acid (CA)-based complexes with biogenic amines, specifically spermine (CA-Sp) and histidine (CA-His), as potential ICT candidates. Initial <i>in vitro</i> assays on HEK-293 cells under iron dextran (ID)-induced toxicity have demonstrated their protective effects, with CA-Sp exhibiting superior efficacy. The <i>in vivo</i> studies in mice have further validated their potential, showing remarkable iron chelation and toxicity mitigation compared to DFO. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) reveals significant iron excretion in fecal matter in the treatment group along with reductions in serum ferritin levels. The markers of nephrotoxicity (creatinine) and liver function (ALT, AST) have also been shown to be normalized in treated groups, while immunological analyses have revealed restored levels of neutrophils, T cells, and B cells. Additionally, the inflammatory cytokines, TNF-α and IL-6, have exhibited significant reductions, with the CA-based formulations surpassing the effects of DFO. Histological analyses using Prussian blue staining have further confirmed reduced iron deposition in vital organs such as the liver, kidney, and spleen. These findings highlight CA-Sp as a particularly promising candidate for ICT, offering a safer and more effective strategy for managing iron overload and its associated complications."

    "abstract": "Discrepancies in gel card immunohematologic testing can result in false-positive reactions, making detecting antibodies and performing crossmatching difficult. Such unexpected reactivity may result from interactions with test system components, including the column matrix, chemicals, or reagents, rather than true antigen-antibody binding. Accurate identification and resolution of these discrepancies are crucial to prevent delays in transfusion and ensure patient safety. This case involved a 24-year-old patient with sickle cell disease who required a blood transfusion, highlighting the diagnostic challenges posed by variability in gel card platforms. Blood grouping was performed using Tulip gel cards (Tulip Diagnostics, Pvt Ltd). The forward grouping was AB positive, but the reverse grouping showed pan-positive results. Repeat grouping by the gold standard-the conventional tube technique-resolved the discrepancy, and the blood group was identified as AB positive. Antibody screening (ABS) and autoantibody testing using Tulip gel cards showed pan-positive reactions, although the direct antiglobulin test was negative. However, conventional tube techniques for ABS and thermal amplitude tests for autoantibodies were negative. Crossmatching of phenotype-matched packed red blood cell units showed incompatibility on Tulip gel cards but compatibility using the conventional tube technique. The possibility of antibodies against enhancement media, such as low-ionic-strength solution, was ruled out after repeat testing with normal saline and phosphate-buffered saline, which showed negative reactions in different immunohematology tests. Due to suspected interference from the gel card components, crossmatching, ABS, and autoantibody testing were repeated using Bio-Rad gel cards, which showed compatible results. The false-positive reactions were attributed to antibodies against materials in Tulip gel cards, including silica-based microbeads, polyvinyl alcohol, and other stabilizers that are absent in Bio-Rad gel cards. This case underscores the importance of multiplatform validation, reagent standardization, and conventional tube testing in resolving immunohematologic discrepancies and ensuring safe transfusion practices."

    "abstract": "Adenosine signaling is emerging as a key regulator of hematopoietic lineage commitment, influencing both erythropoiesis and myelopoiesis. This review explores the distinct roles of adenosine receptors in balancing these processes, particularly under stress conditions. Since adenosine extracellular levels are increased in multiple hematological disorders, including sickle cell disease, deciphering the mechanisms downstream of adenosine receptor activation is crucial to understand the pathophysiology of these conditions. Extracellular adenosine levels in the bone marrow microenvironment are tightly regulated by CD39/CD73 activity and ENT1 uptake. Recent studies have shown that ENT1-mediated adenosine transport is crucial for adenosine intracellular metabolism and normal erythropoiesis, while increased extracellular adenosine levels impact hematopoietic differentiation through adenosine receptor activation. . High dose of exogenous adenosine inhibits erythroid proliferation by inducing G1 arrest and p53-mediated apoptosis. Furthermore, A 2B and A 3 receptor signaling inhibits erythroid differentiation, while adenosine signaling through A 3 also favors granulopoiesis. Collectively, these findings highlight adenosine signaling as a critical and multifaceted regulator of hematopoietic balance, offering novel insights into its therapeutic potential for managing disorders characterized by ineffective erythropoiesis and aberrant myelopoiesis."

    "abstract": "The spectrum of kidney diseases caused by variation in the apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) gene was identified in 2010 among patients with recent African ancestry. In the United States, inheriting two APOL1 risk variants (high-risk genotypes) markedly increases risk for solidified glomerulosclerosis, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, collapsing glomerulopathy, lupus nephritis, and sickle cell nephropathy. Kidneys from African American deceased donors with APOL1 high-risk genotypes also fail more rapidly after transplant. One risk variant increases nephropathy risk in Africa. This review focuses on novel therapies targeting APOL1 and the changing landscape of APOL1 genotyping in patients at risk for APOL1-mediated kidney disease (AMKD). Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockade and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors slow nephropathy progression but are not curative. Medications directly targeting APOL1 mRNA and blocking APOL1 protein effects are undergoing clinical trials in AMKD, including APOL1 small molecule inhibitors, an APOL1 antisense oligonucleotide, and a Janus kinase (JAK) signaling inhibitor to reduce APOL1 expression. Early results are promising and provide hope for well tolerated and effective therapies. If successful, more patients will need to be considered for APOL1 genotyping, and our approach to diagnosing and treating chronic kidney disease in populations with recent African ancestry will change dramatically. Mechanisms of APOL1 risk variant nephrotoxicity remain unclear; nonetheless, specific therapies for AMKD show great promise and may improve understanding of disease processes. With ongoing clinical trials and the potential for effective AMKD treatments, more widespread APOL1 genotyping will likely be needed."

    "abstract": "In sickle cell disease (SCD), red blood cells (RBC) are poorly deformable, even under normoxia. With deoxygenation, deformability of sickle RBCs is further reduced due to polymerization of hemoglobin S (HbS). Rigid, poorly deformable sickle RBCs block microvasculature, causing ischemia, pain, and organ damage. The Microfluidic Impedance Red Cell Assay (MIRCA) can mechanically measure RBC deformability, providing occlusion index under normoxia (NOI) or hypoxia (HOI) as readouts. We analyzed RBCs from 68 adult and 34 pediatric SCD patients using the MIRCA. Higher HOI and NOI were positively associated with markers of inflammation, hemolysis, RBC density, older age, and severe SCD genotypes (HbSS/ Sβ0). Each 1% higher NOI across individuals was associated with a 6.3% higher incidence of acute complications per year. Individuals with chronic complications in the past year had a 3.1% higher median NOI than those without chronic complications. Individuals on chronic transfusion therapy (CTF) exhibit a subpopulation of poorly deformable RBC that is captured by the MIRCA, but not by a commercially available device that also measures RBC deformability, the LoRRca. In vitro addition of voxelotor or osivelotor to samples from individuals on CTF improved the deformability of these endogenous RBC. Longitudinally collected NOI and HOI values in HbSS individuals were stable, with a median percent point change of 13.3% and 15.7%, respectively. MIRCA can be used in combination with clinical laboratory tests to monitor RBC deformability as a biomarker of clinical status at routine clinic visits and included in clinical trials of disease modifying agents."

Child resiliency was not associated with child (<i>r</i> = -0.21, <i>p</i> = 0.12) or caregiver (<i>r</i> = -0.16, <i>p</i> = 0.26) perceived stress. Caregiver and child resiliencies had a significant positive correlation (<i>r</i> = 0.38, <i>p</i> = 0.0046) but no relationship across dyads with perceived stress scores. Children with one to two hospitalizations within the last year had significantly lower median resiliency scores compared with those who had experienced no hospitalizations (median 65 vs. 76, <i>p</i> = 0.0386), but displayed no relationship with genotype, history of stroke, or stem cell transplant. During the COVID-19 pandemic, both groups rated \"worry about my/my child's sickle cell disease\" as the most frequent psychosocial stressor. <b>Conclusions</b>: In a cross-sectional cohort study that explored the relationship between caregiver resiliency and child resiliency in SCD, we found that caregiver resiliency and child resiliency were strongly correlated, while child resiliency showed no significant association with perceived stress. Higher child resiliency scores were associated with fewer hospitalizations. The results indicate the need for interventions to increase both child and caregiver resiliency in SCD, as it may contribute to health outcomes in SCD. Further research is needed to explore cofounding factors influencing resiliency in children with SCD."

    "title": "Assessing Major Organ Dysfunction in Children With Sickle Cell Disease: Protocol for a Cross-Sectional Study.",
    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most common clinically significant genetic disorder affecting about 300,000 newborns globally each year. In Ghana, a prevalence of 1.8% exists among newborns. With increasing life expectancy, assessment of the effect of progressive organ damage on quality of life becomes essential. Organs involved could be the lungs, heart, brain, kidney, and bones. This study aims to describe major organ dysfunction and its associated factors in children aged 6-16 years with SCD in the Kumasi Centre for Sickle Cell Disease (KC-SCD) patient cohort in Kumasi, Ghana. It will be a cross-sectional study conducted over a 1-year 8-month period at the pediatric sickle cell clinic of the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital (KATH). All patients, except those coming for acute care or emergency visits, will be eligible for enrollment. Data on sociodemographic details, medical history, and previous complications, anthropometry, and pubertal stage will be collected. Full blood count, reticulocyte counts, lactate dehydrogenase counts, lung function tests, electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, mental health status assessment and pubertal staging will be conducted to assess end organ dysfunctions. Data will be entered into a REDCap database, cleaned, and exported to the STATA statistical software for analysis. The prevalence of specific end-organ dysfunction will be determined based on predefined criteria. Subsequently, the relationship between the various end-organ dysfunctions and clinical and laboratory covariates will be determined using inferential analysis. These results will help to know the burden of end organ damage in our pediatric population and subsequently feed into the recommendations and hospital policies for screening for end organ dysfunction."

    "title": "Inflammation and Iron Profile in Children With Sickle Cell Disease in Cameroon: Frequency and Associated Factors, an Analytical Cross-Sectional Study.",
    "abstract": "Sickle Cell Disease is a chronic inflammatory disease that could be aggravated by exposure to variable factors such as infections, hemolysis, oxidative stress and so forth. that could preciptate variable acute or end-organ manifestation. However, the degree of inflammation could vary in individuals. Thus this study evaluates the inflammatory state (hs-CRP, IL6, ferritin) of children living with SCD and the associated factors. We conducted an analytical cross-sectional study for 03 months. The patients included were those from the Central Hospital of Yaounde and the Regional Hospital of Bafoussam in which they are regularly monitored and/or interned in the Hematology department. The exploration of inflammation was made by determining hs-CRP, IL6, and ferritin concentrations. The hematological parameters and iron profile were evaluated using standard methods. Statistical analyses of the data were carried out using the statistical software R version 4.1.1. from which logistic regression analyses according to univariate and multivariate models made it possible to identify factors associated with inflammation in patients. Hundred and forty-nine SCD patients were included in the study. The frequency of inflammation in the population was 42.3%. Hyperferritinemia was significantly greater (<i>p</i> < 0.001) in patients with inflammation compared to the noninflammatory patients (96.8% and 76.7% respectively). Patients with inflammation showed a significant elevation of iron parameters (<i>p</i> < 0.05). In addition, ferritin and IL6 elevation were associated with inflammation during sickle cell disease, respectively (OR = 4.96; 95% CI [1.15-36.42]; <i>p</i> = 0.056) and (OR = 6.23; 95% CI [1.43-45.96]; <i>p</i> = 0.030). The elevated iron in plasma is an effect of inflammation in sickle cell patients. Thus, inflammation constitutes a significant and significant factor in worsening the pathophysiology of sickle cell disease. Hence the need of controlling inflammation and iron in the latter is necessary."

    "abstract": "Hydroxyurea is a safe, effective, and well-tolerated disease-modifying therapy for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD), leading to reduced morbidity, mortality, and an improved quality of life. However, its underutilization, driven by inadequate knowledge and variability in use among SCD care providers, may limit its benefits. This study assessed the knowledge and prescription patterns of hydroxyurea among SCD care providers in Jos, Nigeria. A cross-sectional survey of 132 physicians managing SCD was conducted to collect data on socio-demographics, hydroxyurea knowledge, and prescription patterns using a proforma. Knowledge was assessed using 17 questions (maximum score: 17). Scores above 12 (50th percentile) were classified as \"good,\" while scores of 12 or below were categorized as \"poor.\" Prescription patterns were evaluated against the National Institutes of Health (2014) and British Society for Haematology (2018) guidelines. Data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Sixty-seven (50.8%) of the 132 physicians had inadequate knowledge of hydroxyurea's clinical benefits and safety. Only 35 (26.5%) were aware of available treatment guidelines, and 32 (24.2%) had ever prescribed hydroxyurea. Among prescribers, nine (28.1%) used inappropriate criteria to initiate treatment and six (18.8%) prescribed below recommended doses. The median maximum daily prescribed dose was 750mg, whereas five (15.6%) physicians did not exceed 200mg, irrespective of patient weight. Treatment guidelines were not followed by 25 (78.1%) of prescribers. This study revealed a high prevalence of inadequate knowledge and inconsistent hydroxyurea prescription practices among SCD care providers. Targeted training is essential to enhance hydroxyurea utilization and ensure adherence to standardized treatment guidelines, ultimately improving patient outcomes."

    "abstract": "The proximal humerus is the second-most common anatomic site for osteonecrosis, a condition of disrupted blood supply leading to death of bone tissue, with resultant shoulder pain and dysfunction. Core decompression is a viable joint-preserving surgical intervention that aims to improve local blood supply and restore bone health prior to bony collapse. Humeral head osteonecrosis has numerous underlying causes, most commonly the sequelae of prior trauma, chronic use of systemic corticosteroids, sickle cell disease, and alcohol abuse. Core decompression may be indicated in the early, pre-collapse stages of osteonecrosis, whereas more advanced stages of disease are commonly indicated for joint reconstruction procedures, such as bone grafting or arthroplasty. With the patient in the beach chair position, bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC) is harvested through a percutaneous incision along the anterolateral proximal humerus. While viewing through a standard posterior portal, a transtibial anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) guide is placed through an anterior portal at a site on the humeral head surface, centered at the area of greatest humeral head bone edema as identified on preoperative magnetic resonance imaging. A guide pin is placed through a lateral portal within the ACL guide, to the subchondral bone. A 7.0-mm reamer is applied over the guidewire, followed by administration of demineralized bone matrix soaked in BMAC into the reamed channel within the proximal humerus. In patients with early stages of humeral head osteonecrosis, core decompression confers superior clinical outcomes with reduced rates of subsequent surgical procedures compared with nonoperative treatment. Core decompression has shown to reduce the radiographic progression of osteonecrosis. Further research is necessary to determine the additional clinical benefits of augmentation with orthobiologic agents, such as BMAC. Arthroscopic-assisted core decompression is a valuable, minimally invasive surgical treatment for early-stage proximal humerus osteonecrosis. Adjunctive treatment with BMAC and demineralized bone matrix may enhance clinical outcomes. The author(s) attests that consent has been obtained from any patient(s) appearing in this publication. If the individual may be identifiable, the author(s) has included a statement of release or other written form of approval from the patient(s) with this submission for publication."

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD), a serious, chronic blood disorder is the most common genetic blood disease in the United States affecting 100,000 people and disproportionately affecting the African American population. Pregnancy is particularly risky for people with SCD due to higher risk of developing pregnancy-related complications compared with people without the disease. For African American pregnant women with SCD, the risk of maternal morbidity and mortality is up to 10 times higher. Physiological changes during pregnancy increase the risk of vaso-occlusive episodes (VOEs), acute chest syndrome, venous thromboembolic events, and infections. Dehydration increases risk as it triggers sickling of red blood cells, leading to painful VOEs and further increasing the risk of aforementioned complications. Climate change, observed since the mid-20th century, is evidenced by the increasing trend of global temperature, hurricanes, floods, and heat waves. Climate changes can profoundly impact people with SCD, as elevated temperatures result in increased core body temperatures, blood hyperosmolality, and dehydration. Assisted by a research librarian, a literature search was undertaken of major databases (PubMed, Embase, and Google Scholar), with delimiters of publication between 2019 and 2024 and human subjects, and 477 studies were retrieved. After meticulous screening, 20 relevant articles were analyzed. Evidence linking climate change impact to increased risk for pregnant people with SCD is lacking. Further research is needed to examine the phenomenon and mitigate this unique risk of climate change. SCD clinical guidelines stress the importance of preventing dehydration. Clinicians play a critical role in educating this vulnerable population about risks, including dehydration and exposure to extreme heat."

    "abstract": "This systematic review aims to summarise the clinical outcomes of l-glutamine, crizanlizumab, and voxelotor in the treatment of sickle cell disease (SCD) based on clinical trials and real-world data and to identify any gaps in the observations. The review identified 97 studies reporting data until 31 May 2024. A pivotal phase III study of l-glutamine showed that patients treated with l-glutamine had a 25 % reduction in pain crises and 33 % fewer hospital days compared to placebo. l-glutamine was generally well tolerated with minimal side effects. Real-world studies of l-glutamine emphasize patient adherence and obstacles to medication accessibility and approval as key concerns. In the SUSTAIN study, a 5-mg/kg dose of crizanlizumab reduced the occurrence of vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs) and hospitalizations by 45 % and 41 %, respectively. Real-world studies of crizanlizumab showed a reduction in complicated VOC events. The high discontinuation rate and results of the STAND trial led to a significant decrease in the use of crizanlizumab. The HOPE trial demonstrated a 51 % improvement in hemoglobin response and a reduction in hemolytic markers in patients treated with voxelotor. While some real-world studies have reported a decrease in VOCs and hospitalizations, the results are inconsistent and not conclusive. Further studies are needed to assess the impact of these novel therapies on end-organ-specific complications of SCD."

    "abstract": "A case of a patient in her 30s with sickle cell anaemia who developed multiorgan failure and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome(ARDS) from acute chest syndrome (ACS) despite a simple red blood cell transfusion is presented in this report. She was treated with plasma exchange (PLEX) due to a history of severe delayed haemolytic transfusion reaction and a lack of available compatible units of packed red blood cells. Following one session of PLEX with half plasma/half albumin, she had rapid clinical improvement from mechanical ventilation to room air in 5 days. This finding is consistent with existing case reports of rapid improvement in pain, oxygenation and organ function following PLEX. Proposed mechanisms include the modulation of rheological properties of red blood cells by plasma, as well as the removal of the cytotoxic effects of haptoglobin and haemopexin. This case demonstrates the effectiveness and safety of an alternative upfront approach to managing complications related to ACS in those who are heavily alloimmunised."

Activation of delta globin, the non-alpha globin of HbA2 (α2δ2), could represent a possible approach to improve the clinical severity of these pathologies. Notably, the therapeutic potential of delta globin has been demonstrated in previous studies using a mouse model of beta-thalassemia and sickle cell disease. The present study evaluated <i>delta globin</i> gene activation by small molecules in erythroid cells isolated from transgenic murine foetal liver. A screening of 119 molecules, selected for their potential in drug repurposing, was performed without prior selection based on specific pathways of interest. Three candidates-Nexturastat, Stattic and Palbociclib-were found to have high efficacy on <i>delta globin</i> expression. Palbociclib also proved effective in increasing <i>gamma globin</i> expression. All of these compounds have pharmacokinetic profiles that are beneficial for clinical application, providing potential inducer agents of HbA2 that could have therapeutic effects in the treatment of beta-hemoglobinopathies."

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most common hemoglobinopathy. We aimed to identify the prevalence of hepatobiliary injury and its association with mortality in SCD. Patients with SCD followed at a dedicated clinic at our tertiary center were retrospectively evaluated with descriptive statistics. Correlations between hepatobiliary complications and SCD complications were expressed as ORs. To evaluate mortality predictors, log-rank testing was used for univariate analysis and Cox proportional hazards for multivariable analysis, with time-dependent covariates for biochemistry. Between January 1990 and December 2020, 1009 patients with SCD were identified; 63.2% were HbSS. The median age at first clinic visit was 26.4 years (IQR: 18.9-37.1), 44.3% were male, and 62.6% were ever treated with hydroxyurea. The median follow-up was 4.8 years (IQR: 1.9-8.5); mortality was 8.9%. The most frequent hepatobiliary manifestations were cholelithiasis (n=431 [42.7%]) and iron overload (n=121; 12%). Chronic viral hepatitis was reported in only 18 patients. Twenty-nine patients (2.1%) had peak ALT> 2× upper limit of normal, 15 (2.3%) had peak ALP> 2× upper limit of normal, 97 (10.3%) had peak total bilirubin >103 μmol/L, (6.02 mg/dL), and 184 (18.2%) patients had elevated peak direct bilirubin. Hepatomegaly was reported in 37 patients (3.7%), while 24 patients (2.4%) were clinically cirrhotic. Five patients received a liver transplant.

    "abstract": "Hydroxyurea (HU) is the most widely used therapy for adults and children with sickle cell disease (SCD). It is believed to act largely by inducing the transcription of fetal <i>γ-globin</i> genes to generate fetal hemoglobin (HbF), which inhibits the pathological polymerization of sickle hemoglobin (HbS). The mechanisms by which hydroxyurea elevates HbF are unclear. We explored the hypothesis that hydroxyurea induces HbF expression by inhibiting the expression of 2 <i>γ-globin</i> gene repressors, BCL11A and ZBTB7A (also known as LRF), which normally bind the <i>γ-globin</i> gene promoters to inhibit their expression after birth. We treated immortalized murine erythroleukemia cells and normal human donor CD34<sup>+</sup> hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell-derived erythroblasts with hydroxyurea and measured the effects on globin, BCL11A and ZBTB7A protein and mRNA expression. Treating murine erythroleukemia cells or human CD34<sup>+</sup> hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell-derived erythroblasts with hydroxyurea reduced the protein levels of BCL11A and ZBTB7A compared to the vehicle-treated control. <i>BCL11A</i> mRNA levels were reduced in both cell types upon hydroxyurea treatment. However, <i>ZBTB7A</i> mRNA levels were only reduced in human CD34<sup>+</sup> hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell-derived erythroblasts. Hydroxyurea can act in erythroid cells to reduce the levels and activity of two direct fetal <i>γ-globin</i> transcriptional repressors with accompanying de-repression of the <i>γ-globin</i> genes and induction of HbF, which may explain the mechanism of action leading to amelioration of symptoms in SCD patients treated with this drug."

    "abstract": "Chronic pain in SCD has been defined as pain on most days over 6 months. In the landmark Pain in Sickle Cell Epidemiology Study, 60% of patients submitted <5 of the expected 6 months of pain diaries. Identifying chronic SCD pain using this long daily assessment interval is impractical. We therefore examined whether shorter, less burdensome intervals could accurately identify chronic SCD pain. As the gold-standard sample, we chose the 116 Pain in Sickle Cell Epidemiology Study patients who submitted >5 months of diaries (153) and >49% of diaries during all months from 1 to 4. Using the same dataset, we tested daily diary assessment over shorter intervals: 2 weeks, 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, and 4 months. We defined chronic pain as intensity rated as >0 on >50% of diary days, regardless of interval. We then calculated the sensitivity and specificity of each diary interval. Among the gold-standard sample, 51.3% of patients had diary-defined chronic pain. Collection intervals of 2 months or more yielded similar chronic pain prevalences with identically high sensitivity (98.3%) and specificity (93%). Intervals of 1 month and 2 weeks yielded increasingly lower specificity (80.7%, 73.7%, respectively), but preserved sensitivity (≥96.6%). In the Pain in Sickle Cell Epidemiology Study, intervals of 2 months or more of daily diary collection yielded high sensitivity and specificity, compared to an interval of 5-6 months. One may reasonably diagnose chronic SCD pain using 2 months of daily diaries."

The association between underlying haematological disease, age at splenectomy and post-splenectomy complications was explored among 1348 splenectomized patients, followed with a median follow-up time of 13 years and affected by transfusion-dependent thalassaemia, non-transfusion-dependent thalassaemia (NTDT), sickle cell anaemia (SCA), congenital haemolytic anaemias, autoimmune haematological disorders and trauma. Our main statistical approach was based on interaction analyses within competing-risk survival models. The baseline risk profile differed across diagnostic categories, with SCA being particularly susceptible to infectious complications and NTDT and SCA to vascular events (p < 0.001). The age at splenectomy did not impact on infectious risk but rather older age at splenectomy was associated with increased risk for vascular complications. Furthermore, the risk of developing a post-splenectomy complication was persistent throughout the observation period and not limited to the first 2-3 years after splenectomy. The probability of a post-splenectomy complication was highly dependent on the underlying disease and not on the age at splenectomy, so the indications for splenectomy must be based on careful assessment of pros and cons in the individual disease, with no need to delay surgery after a certain age when clinically indicated."

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD), encompassing genotypes such as HbSS and HbSC, causes chronic haemolysis and microvascular occlusion, leading to organ damage. The retina is particularly vulnerable, often resulting in sickle cell retinopathy (SCR) or sickle cell maculopathy (SCM). The precise underlying mechanisms are unclear, though various factors are suggested to contribute. This study explored the role of whole blood viscosity and red blood cell (RBC) deformability in SCR and SCM. Adult HbSS (n = 34) and HbSC patients (n = 34) were offered an ophthalmic examination to determine SCR stage. A venous ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) sample was collected from each participant. Whole blood viscosity was measured using a Brookfield viscometer and RBC deformability was assessed using the Oxygenscan feature of the Laser Optical Rotational Red Cell Analyser as a function of the (varying) partial oxygen pressure. HbSC patients with proliferative sickle cell retinopathy (PSCR) had a lower delta elongation index (p = 0.012) and point of sickling (p = 0.002) than those without PSCR, suggesting that RBC sickling might not play a central role in the pathogenesis of PSCR in HbSC patients. Despite hyperviscosity being a commonly proposed mechanism, no associations were found between blood viscosity, SCR and SCM. These results point to alternative mechanisms contributing to SCR and SCM, highlighting the complexity and need for further research to fully understand the underlying factors."

The aim of this study is to examine the relationship between self-reported institutional medical mistrust and views on the importance and utility of COVID-19 vaccine research participation among adults living with sickle cell disease (SCD) in the United States. This cross-sectional study is part of a larger longitudinal study aimed at understanding the lived experiences of individuals living with SCD in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data from the first wave of the longitudinal study, collected June- December 2020, were used for the analyses (n = 185). Two single-item variables ascertaining the utility of participation in clinical trial research for COVID-19 vaccines were examined. Institutional medical mistrust was measured utilizing a modified medical mistrust index. Multivariable binary logistic regression models were utilized, adjusting for applicable sociodemographic, behavioral, and clinical variables. A majority of study participants agreed with statements regarding beliefs about the importance of participating in vaccine research (71.4%) and the utility of vaccine research for family and self (60.0%). Findings indicated that having any level of worry of COVID-19 infection was significantly associated with greater agreement with the importance of participating in COVID-19 vaccine research (OR = 3.41, 95% CI 1.346-8.641, p = 0.01) and higher agreement with the utility of vaccine research for themselves and their families (OR = 3.54, 95% CI: 1.332-9.403, p = 0.01), after adjusting for covariates. Agreement with the utility of vaccine research participation was also found to be associated with higher SCD severity (OR = 1.26, 95% CI: 1.043-1.537, p = 0.02). In contrast, higher medical mistrust was inversely associated with agreement of this statement (OR = 0.44, 95% CI: 0.222-0.89, p = 0.02). Our findings reveal that for individuals living with sickle cell disease, the worry of infection and the severity of their individual disease were more important in shaping views towards vaccine research participation than medical mistrust."

    "title": "Hemoglobin S Promotes Glycemic Dysregulation in a Mouse Model of Human Sickle Cell Disease.",
    "abstract": "Hemoglobin S (HbS) presents a challenge to identifying glycemic dysregulation, as changes in red blood cell turnover produce inaccurate hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and incongruencies between HbA1c and other glycemic control measures. Concerningly, the prevalence of diabetes in those with HbS is rising, and studies demonstrate that HbS increases the risk of diabetes-related complications. Though a link between the sickle cell variant and HbA1c is reported, the precise mechanisms by which HbS affects glycemic control are unknown. Here, we utilized the Townes mouse model of sickle cell disease (SCD) to analyze the effect of sickle cell trait (SCT) and SCD on glucose homeostasis. We found that chow-fed SCD mice had greater ad libitum and fasting blood glucose than SCT or littermate controls from 8 to 20 weeks of age, along with declining fasting serum insulin with aging, regardless of sex. This was not a result of overt alterations in peripheral glucose or insulin tolerance, gross morphological changes in pancreatic structure, or deposition of iron in pancreatic islets. Furthermore, compared with age- and sex-matched SCT and littermate control mice, we found decreased pancreatic insulin content in 20-week-old SCD male mice and significantly reduced pancreatic islet area and β cell mass in SCD males and females. These findings suggest that having 2 copies of the HbS gene promotes early hyperglycemia and the development of pancreatic β cell dysfunction, which may enhance the risk for diabetes in this cohort."

    "title": "Retinal Ischemic Perivascular Lesions (RIPLs) as Potential Biomarkers for Systemic Vascular Diseases: A Narrative Review of the Literature.",
    "abstract": "Retinal ischemic perivascular lesions (RIPLs) are characteristic focal thinning of the inner nuclear layer, with an upward expansion of the outer nuclear layer identified by spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), causing a focal irregular appearance of the middle retina. RIPLs result from retinal hypoperfusion in the deep capillary plexus, as a legacy of paracentral acute middle maculopathy, representing permanent anatomical markers of prior ischemic events. Although frequently found incidentally during routine eye examinations, RIPLs may provide insights into subclinical vascular damage that underpins various cardio- and cerebrovascular diseases. The aim of this narrative review is to summarize the relationships of RIPLs with retinal and systemic vascular diseases, including arterial hypertension, coronary artery disease, carotid artery stenosis, atrial fibrillation, stroke, sickle cell disease, and diabetes mellitus. Cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, which are the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide, often remain asymptomatic for years despite early structural changes until severe adverse events occur. Noninvasive retinal biomarkers such as RIPLs, which are readily and noninvasively detected through SD-OCT scans, could help in the early detection and stratification of patients at risk for cardiovascular diseases, facilitate timely medical interventions and lifestyle changes, and ultimately improve disease prevention in a \"personalized medicine\" approach. While further research is needed to establish the prevalence of RIPLs in the general population and their full clinical significance, advances in ophthalmic imaging technologies combined with rapid progress in artificial intelligence applications in medical research could accelerate the development of RIPLs in retinal imaging-based oculomics."

    "title": "Thoracic Segmental Spinal Anesthesia for Laparoscopic Surgeries in Pediatric Patients: A Retrospective Case Series.",
    "abstract": "Thoracic segmental spinal anesthesia (TSSA) is a developing regional anesthesia approach that involves administering local anesthetics into the thoracic spine to produce a targeted nerve block. This segmental block provides stable hemodynamics and early recovery. Lumbar spinal anesthesia is a common practice in children, and TSSA can be a promising technique due to its advantages. Despite the theoretical advantages of TSSA in pediatric patients, there is a paucity of literature describing its clinical use, safety profile, and outcomes in this population. This case series presents our initial clinical experience with TSSA in pediatric patients undergoing various laparoscopic surgical procedures. We aim to highlight the feasibility and safety of TSSA in the pediatric population while contributing to filling the gap in the literature supporting its broader application. Five pediatric patients undergoing various surgeries under TSSA were included in this study conducted between July 2021 and April 2022 at a single center. Demographic, clinical, TSSA technique, intraoperative, and postoperative data were extracted from hospital records. There were three male and two female patients between the ages of 6 and 13 years. One patient had sickle cell anemia, and one was suffering from an upper respiratory tract infection. All cases were conducted successfully under TSSA without significant complications. This study demonstrates that TSSA can be a feasible and safe regional anesthetic technique in pediatric patients undergoing surgeries confined to thoracic and upper abdominal dermatomes. While our findings are encouraging, larger prospective studies are necessary to establish standardized protocols, optimize dosing strategies, and further validate the role of TSSA in pediatric anesthesia practice."

    "abstract": "HbA<sub>1c</sub> testing in African populations may be limited due to high prevalence of hemoglobinopathies, anaemia, malaria and renal impairment. We aimed to assess the performance of glycated albumin (GA) and fructosamine in comparison to HbA<sub>1c</sub> for determining glycaemic control in Africans living with type 2 diabetes. We compared the relationship between fructosamine, GA, and HbA<sub>1c</sub> with mean continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) glucose and assessed the impact of sickle cell trait (SCT), anaemia and renal impairment on the relationship between each measure and CGM glucose. The overall association of HbA<sub>1c</sub>, GA and fructosamine with CGM glucose was similar (r = 0.88 [95%CI: 0.84, 0.91], 0.84 [0.79, 0.88] and 0.84 [0.79, 0.88]), respectively. For detecting those with mean CGM glucose >8 mmol/L HbA<sub>1c</sub> had similar diagnostic accuracy to GA and fructosamine, even in those with conditions reported to affect HbA<sub>1c</sub> performance (n = 63). We found no evidence that SCT (n = 43/192) altered the relationship between HbA<sub>1c</sub>, fructosamine or GA with CGM glucose (p > 0.3 for all). However, individuals with anaemia showed an underestimation of CGM glucose by HbA<sub>1c</sub> and fructosamine compared to those without anaemia (p for interaction <0.005 for both). In contrast, GA with average CGM glucose between those with anaemia and those without were not significantly different. Switching to fructosamine or GA is unlikely to improve the accuracy of laboratory glycaemic monitoring beyond that of HbA<sub>1c</sub> in a population with high prevalence of conditions reported to affect HbA<sub>1c</sub> reliability."

    "abstract": "Ebola virus (EBOV) replication is regulated by the host protein phosphatases, PP1 and PP2A, which dephosphorylate the transcriptional cofactor of EBOV polymerase VP30. The PP1-targeting compound 1E7-03 induces VP30 phosphorylation and inhibits EBOV infection. Here, we investigate the broader role of PP1 in EBOV replication and transcription, including its interaction with nucleoprotein (NP). When EBOV-infected cells were continuously treated with 1E7-03, the NP E619K mutation was found and selected for further analysis. The NP E619K mutation moderately reduced the EBOV minigenome transcription, which was restored by the treatment with 1E7-03. Proteomics, immunoprecipitation, dimerization, split NanoBit, and colocalization analyses indicated that NP interacts with PP1 and that NP E619K mutations enhanced this binding. Treatment with 1E7-03 dissociated PP1-NP complex, but enhanced NP dimerization, which was more pronounced for NP E619K mutant. Mutation and deletion analyses pointed to several potential PP1-binding sites in NP that were located in the moderately disordered NP regions. When NP was co-expressed with VP24 and VP35, formation of EBOV capsids was impaired with NP E619K mutation. Treatment with 1E7-03 restored the capsid formation by the NP E619K mutant but inhibited capsids formed by WT NP. Our findings suggest that PP1 binds to NP and that this binding might regulate NP dimerization and capsid formation. Collectively, our results point to a new role for PP1 in EBOV replication, in which NP binding to PP1 may facilitate viral transcription by delaying capsid formation and EBOV replication."

Bugando Medical Centre, a major healthcare provider, faces undocumented adherence issues among its pediatric SCA patients. This study aims to evaluate the adherence rate to hydroxyurea therapy among caregivers of children with SCA at Bugando Medical Centre and identify factors contributing to non-adherence. This analytical cross-sectional study involved 172 participants. Data were analyzed using Stata version 15 and modified Poisson regression determined the association between exposures and adherence to hydroxyurea treatment. More than half (68.6%) of the children were aged between 1 and 10 years, with a median age of 8 years (IQR: 5-12). Good adherence to hydroxyurea was observed in 23.8% of participants, while 76.2% showed moderate to poor adherence. Children aged 1-10 years were twice as likely to have good adherence compared to those aged 11-17 years (aPR = 2.98, 95% CI = 1.18, 7.47). Children of caregivers with secondary education had a 41% higher chance of good adherence (aPR = 1.41, 95% CI = 1.19, 2.87) compared to those with primary education. Additionally, children of caregivers with college/university education had a 92% higher chance of good adherence (aPR = 1.92, 95% CI = 1.09, 4.63) compared to those with primary education. Participants with good knowledge of hydroxyurea had a 55% higher chance of good adherence (aPR = 1.55, 95% CI = 1.10, 4.78) compared to those with poor knowledge. Factors such as the child's age and caregiver's educational level are associated with good adherence to hydroxyurea treatment. Despite these associations, overall adherence rates are low, highlighting the need for targeted interventions to enhance knowledge and awareness about the importance of adherence to hydroxyurea treatment."

    "abstract": "<i>Background and Objectives</i>: Priapism is a condition characterized by a prolonged erection lasting over four hours, either independent of or following sexual stimulation. The primary treatment goal for ischemic and non-ischemic priapism is timely and appropriate intervention in order to preserve erectile function and penile length. This study aims to evaluate the management of recurrent ischemic priapism in sickle cell disease (SCD) patients in an endemic region and compare it with ischemic priapism of other etiologies. <i>Materials and Methods</i>: Patients admitted to our hospital with a diagnosis of priapism between January 2010 and June 2024 were retrospectively reviewed. The patients were divided into two groups: ischemic priapism due to SCD and ischemic priapism due to other etiologies. Patient characteristics, treatment management, and the need for penile prosthesis (PP) were compared. <i>Results</i>: A total of 40 ischemic priapism patients were included in the study; 20 of them had SCD and the other 20 had priapism cases due to different etiologies. In the SCD priapism group, the rate of comorbidity and previous history of priapism were significantly (<i>p</i> < 0.05) higher than in the other etiologies of priapism group. Similarly, in the SCD priapism group, the hospital admission time and the rate of fibrosis findings in MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) were significantly (<i>p</i> < 0.05) higher than in the other priapism groups. The PP implantation rate in the SCD priapism group was found to be significantly (<i>p</i> < 0.05) higher than in the other priapism group. <i>Conclusions</i>: This study highlights the importance of early intervention and patient awareness in SCD-related ischemic priapism, recommending educational programs to improve symptom recognition and prevent complications."

    "title": "Reproductive Choices in Haemoglobinopathies: The Role of Preimplantation Genetic Testing.",
    "abstract": "Haemoglobinopathies are among the most prevalent genetic disorders globally. In the context of these conditions, preimplantation genetic testing (PGT) plays a pivotal role in preventing genetic diseases in the offspring of carrier parents, reducing the need for pregnancy termination and enabling the selection of compatible sibling donors for potential stem cell transplantation in cases of thalassemia or sickle cell disease. This review explores the evolving role of PGT as a reproductive option for haemoglobinopathy carriers, tracing the development of PGT protocols from patient-specific to comprehensive testing enabled by advanced technologies like next-generation sequencing (NGS). We discuss key technical, biological, and practical limitations of PGT, as well as the ethical considerations specific to haemoglobinopathies, such as the complexity of interpreting genotypes. Emerging technologies, such as whole-genome sequencing, non-invasive PGT, and gene editing, hold significant promise for expanding applications but also raise new challenges that must be addressed. It will be interesting to explore how advancements in technology, along with the changing management of haemoglobinopathies, will impact reproductive choices. It is anticipated that continued research will improve genetic counseling for PGT for haemoglobinopathies, while a careful evaluation of ethical and societal implications is also required. Responsible and equitable implementation of PGT is essential for ensuring that all families at risk can make informed reproductive choices."

Previous studies have associated microRNAs with the regulation of HBG2, prompting this study to investigate specific microRNAs linked to HbF regulation in patients treated with hydroxyurea. 150 patients were recruited in the study. miRNA microarray panel of 754 miRNAs was used, and a further customised microarray card was designed. In silico tools predicted target genes of miRNAs and in vitro transfection functionally validated miRNAs in erythroblast cells from patients and K562 cells. Global microarray revealed 59 differentially expressed miRNAs, with 42 upregulated and 17 downregulated significantly following 3/6 months of hydroxyurea treatment (p < 0.001). Further, the customised miRNA panel of these 59 miRNAs confirmed the results. Among 59 miRNAs, 12 upregulated and 3 downregulated miRNAs correlated with HBG2 expression and HbF levels. In silico predictions and in vitro cells study identified miR-150, miR-155, miR-374, miR-486-3p (BCL11A, MYB); miR-190, miR-26a, miR-30b, miR-362, miR-411 (BCL11A); miR-192, miR-454 (MYB); miR-326 (KLF1); miR-150 (GATA1) and miR-15a, miR-484, miR-105 commonly share BCL11A, MYB, KLF1 and GATA1.

    "abstract": "<b>Background/Objectives</b>: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is increasingly rising due to antimicrobial overuse and misuse. In sickle cell disease (SCD) care, frequent antibiotic use drives the rapid emergence of AMR, threatening treatment options and patient lives. This systematic review synthesizes data on AMR with regard to SCD patients for the first time. <b>Methods</b>: A comprehensive database search for articles published in English was conducted in PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and Web of Science, with no restriction set for the year of publication. The DerSimonian-Laird method was applied to derive the pooled prevalence, while the Mantel-Haenszel method was used to calculate the pooled odds ratio. <b>Results</b>: A total of 18 eligible studies covering 3220 SCD patients published between 1996 and 2024 were included in this review. The common bacterial pathogens reported in the included studies were <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i> (10 studies), <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (10 studies), and <i>Escherichia coli</i> (4 studies). For <i>S. aureus</i>, the pooled resistance was highest for penicillins (ampicillin = 100%; penicillin = 93.64%; and amoxicillin = 77.82%) followed by cefuroxime (51.23%). The pooled prevalence of methicillin-resistant <i>S. aureus</i> (MRSA) was 19.30%. SCD patients had 2.89 and 2.47 times higher odds of being colonized or infected with penicillin-resistant and erythromycin-resistant <i>S. aureus</i> strains, respectively. For <i>S. pneumoniae</i>, resistance prevalence was highest for co-trimoxazole (81.1%), followed by penicillin (47.08%). The pooled prevalence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) <i>S. pneumoniae</i> isolates was 32.12%. The majority of the studies included (<i>n</i> = 14, 77.8%) were of moderate quality according to the modified STROBE checklist. <b>Conclusions</b>: This review reveals a high prevalence of AMR with regard to SCD patients. SCD patients have an increased risk of resistance to penicillin and co-trimoxazole across several bacterial pathogens. The limited geographical distribution of the included studies underscores the urgent need for expanded AMR research on the subject, especially in regions with high SCD burden."

The aim of this study was to evaluate prophylactic transfusion on pregnancy outcomes. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis (PROSPERO-CRD42024510511), using MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane, Web of Science, and Maternity and Infant Care. No date or language restrictions were applied. Inclusion criteria comprised randomised-controlled trials (RCTs) involving SCD pregnancy, comparing maternal and foetal outcomes for prophylactic versus on-demand transfusions. Two independent reviewers performed screening, selection, and data extraction, following PRISMA. Two authors independently assessed certainty and risk-of-bias. Data were pooled using random-effects model. Primary outcomes included mortality, vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC), acute chest syndrome, venous thromboembolism and preterm delivery. The measure of the effect was the unadjusted odds ratio (OR), calculated from numbers of events. Ninety-one studies were identified and two RCTs (106 patients) were included, with uncertain and low risk of bias. Prophylactic transfusions reduced VOC, OR of 0.197 (95% CI 0.08-0.49). However, due to the small number of patients, this meta-analysis was underpowered to evaluate other outcomes. A larger RCT is needed to comprehensively assess the impact of prophylactic transfusion in SCD pregnancy."

The Hb samples were obtained starting from whole blood of healthy individuals and patients, which was processed by classical methods (centrifugation, decanting and freezing-thawing cycles). An Ostwald's viscometer was used to measure (293 K) <i>η<sub>Hb</sub></i> in Hb solutions of different concentrations and in non-diluted Hb samples belonging to healthy individuals.

Using an Accountability for Reasonableness process, we worked with a multidisciplinary committee to develop our program's initial GT allocation framework. This defines the population eligible for GT among patients with SCD and TDT, balancing inclusivity and safety. Among those eligible, prioritization is based on: 1) disease prevalence-based proportionality, 2) those who may not be eligible for GT in the future (\"sickest first\" due to impending organ failure), 3) those without an allogeneic donor, and 4) lottery. Transparent, adaptable frameworks are crucial for just GT allocation. Collaboration across programs is essential for equitable access and mitigating gamesmanship. While this single-center framework cannot address systemic inequities, we hope our transparent process serves as a model for other programs."

The Package of Essential Noncommunicable Disease Interventions - Plus (PEN-Plus) strategy aims to address gaps in access to care for SC-NCDs by integrating and decentralizing care. This study aims to assess baseline readiness of 16 facilities in nine LLMICs to provide care for SC-NCDs as part of a mixed-methods evaluation of PEN-Plus implementation. Cross-sectional surveys were utilized to collect baseline data from 16 facilities initiating new PEN-Plus programs. These surveys assessed the state of facility infrastructure and the availability of equipment and medicines for three priority conditions (type 1 diabetes (T1D), sickle cell disease (SCD), severe cardiac conditions (SCC)). Analysis consisted of descriptive statistics and summary index scores based on availability of key items. Facilities reported a high baseline availability of basic infrastructure. Readiness to provide care for priority SC-NCDs varied. Availability of functional diagnostic and management equipment and supplies for T1D was especially low in many facilities but higher for SCD. Medicine availability was overall highest for T1D (75%) but lower for SCD (39%) and SCC (49%), with significant gaps in essential medicines including hydroxyurea, anticoagulants, and medium- or long-lasting insulins.These findings highlight the need for tailored, context-driven implementation approaches to address gaps in readiness for SC-NCD care in LLMICs. Baseline results will guide ongoing implementation and evaluation of the PEN-Plus clinics."

In this cross-sectional study, 78 eyes of 39 patients with SCA were included in the patient group and 68 eyes of 34 healthy participants were included in the control group. Differences in foveal avascular zone (FAZ), retinal and subfoveal choroidal thickness (SFCT), and choroidal vascularity index (CVI) between the patient group and the control group were evaluated by swept source optical coherence tomography (OCT) and OCT angiography (OCTA) imaging. In addition, systemic and biological parameters were compared in patients with and without SCM. SCM was detected in 16 eyes of 8 patients. Proliferative sickle cell retinopathy (PSCR) was present in 10 patients. In logistic regression analysis, PSCR was found to be a risk factor for the development of SCM (p=0.015, odds ratio: 17.25, 95% confidence interval: 1.73-172.02). The temporal inner retinal layers were significantly thinner in the patient group compared to the control group. The patient group also exhibited significantly greater FAZ enlargement in both the superficial and deep capillary plexus when compared with the control group (p<0.001 for both). CVI was higher in the control group than in the patient group (p<0.001). SFCT was significantly thinner in the patient group (p=0.013). There was no significant difference between patients with and without SCM in terms of FAZ enlargement, CVI values, or systemic and biological factors. In our study, PSCR was found to be a risk factor for the development of SCM. OCT and OCTA provide valuable information about microvascular changes in the retina and choroid in patients with SCM. Structural changes demonstrated by OCTA before the development of SCM are very important for follow-up and treatment in terms of visual prognosis of patients."

    "abstract": "We present a prospective randomized, placebo-controlled trial of intravenous arginine in patients 3-21 years hospitalized with sickle cell disease vaso-occlusive pain episodes (SCD-VOE) at two tertiary-care children's hospitals. Participants were randomized into 1 of 3 arms: Standard-dose (SD; 100 mg/kg/dose) every 8 h, Loading-dose (200 mg/kg followed by SD), or Placebo. The primary outcome was total parenteral opioid use (TPO). Secondary outcomes included time-to-crisis-resolution, pain scores, patient-reported outcomes (PROs), arginine bioavailability, and biomarkers of oxidative stress/mitochondrial function. Of 1548 patients screened, 108 were randomized (36 per study-arm; mean 12.6 ± 3.8 years, 52% female, and 65% hemoglobin-SS). This study did not meet its primary endpoint. TPO, time-to-crisis-resolution, pain scores, and PROs at discharge were similar across arms. Post hoc sensitivity analyses of children 5-16 years old demonstrated nearly double TPO utilization in those receiving placebo versus arginine (n = 87, p = 0.056), achieving significance in patients with plasma arginine < 60 μM. Arginine was low at presentation in 79% of patients (mean 50 ± 28 μM), and increased with arginine therapy (p < 0.001). Arginine bioavailability at VOE presentation inversely correlated with time-to-crisis-resolution (r = -0.39, p = 0.01) after placebo, an association eliminated by arginine supplementation (r = -0.04, p = 0.70). A dose-dependent increase in platelet-mitochondrial activity occurred after arginine versus no change after placebo (p < 0.001); plasma protein-carbonyl levels, a measure of oxidative stress, decreased after arginine therapy (p < 0.001) but increased in the placebo group (p = 0.02). SCD-VOE is associated with an acquired arginine deficiency that correlates with worse clinical outcomes. Arginine improved mitochondrial function and decreased oxidative stress compared to placebo, with clinically relevant opioid-sparing becoming significant in children with the lowest arginine concentration. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02536170) in August 2015."

    "title": "Exploring pharmacogenetic factors influencing hydroxyurea response in tanzanian sickle cell disease patients: a genomic medicine approach.",
    "abstract": "In sub-Saharan Africa, sickle cell disease (SCD) remains a significant public health challenge. Despite the discovery of SCD over a century ago, progress in developing and accessing effective treatments has been limited. Hydroxyurea is the primary drug used for managing SCD and associated with improving clinical outcomes. However, up to 30% of patients do not respond to hydroxyurea, likely due to genetic factors. This study involved 148 individuals with SCD investigated the association of hydroxyurea response with genetic variants across 13 loci associated with HbF synthesis and drug metabolism, focusing on MYB, HBB, HBG1, HBG2, BCL11A, KLF10, HAO2, NOS1, ARG2, SAR1A, CYP2C9, and CYP2E1. Significant associations with hydroxyurea response were identified in CYP2C9, CYP2E1, KLF10, BCL11A, ARG2, HBG1, SAR1A, MYB, and NOS1 loci. Furthermore, pathway enrichment and gene-gene interaction analyses provide deeper insights into the genetic mechanisms underlying hydroxyurea treatment response, highlighting potential avenues for personalized therapy in SCD management."

    "abstract": "Leg ulcer is the most common cutaneous manifestation of sickle cell disease (SCD). Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) inhibits nitric oxide synthase, reducing nitric oxide availability, and causing endothelial dysfunction. This study examined the relationship between arginine/ADMA ratio and leg ulcers in SCD. This was a cross-sectional analytical study of 90 adult subjects including 30 \"HbS only\" with leg ulcer, 30 \"HbS only\" without leg ulcer and 30 HbAA subjects. Plasma arginine and ADMA levels were measured by ELISA method. Median arginine level, ADMA level, and arginine/ADMA ratio were 21.05 µmol/L, 3.0 µmol/L, and 7.41, respectively, for HbS-only with leg ulcer; 25.9 µmol/L, 2.8 µmol/L, and 9.6, respectively, for HbS-only without leg ulcer; and 47.8 µmol/L, 1.0 µmol/L (CI: 1.0-1.2), and 48.5, respectively, for HbAA subjects. Median plasma <sc>l</sc>-arginine level was significantly lower in HbS with leg ulcer compared to HbS without leg ulcer (p < 0.001) and HbAA subjects (p < 0.001). Conversely, median plasma ADMA level was significantly higher in HbS-only with leg ulcer compared to HbS without leg ulcer (p = 0.002), and HbAA subjects (p < 0.001). Median arginine/ADMA ratio was significantly lower in HbS-only patients with leg ulcer. The HbS-only patients with leg ulcers have lower arginine, higher ADMA, and lower arginine/ADMA ratio when compared to those without leg ulcers and HbAA controls. The prospective arginine/ADMA ratio should be studied to screen patients with higher risks of leg ulcers that could be prevented with specifically targeted care."

    "abstract": "Background: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of parenteral epoprostenol in sickle cell adults patients presenting acute cor pulmonale (ACP) complicating severe acute chest syndrome (ACS). Methods: Retrospective single-center analysis of sickle cell patients in ICU with ACP complicating severe ACS receiving epoprostenol, in addition to usual care (prostacyclin group) or usual care alone (control group). Primary outcome: relative change in pulmonary artery systolic pressure over 1 day. Results: 45 patients were included in the study, including 21 who received usual care and 24 who received epoprostenol. There was a significant reduction in pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) during the first 24 h in the prostacyclin group (from 69 [60-77] to 52 [42-61] mmHg, P < 0.001) but not in the control group (from 50 [40-56] to 50 [35-55] mmHg, P = 0.285). The median decrease in PASP was greater in the prostacyclin group than in the control group (-25% [-33;-13] vs. -2% [-8; 0], P < 0.001). Conclusion: Parenteral prostacyclin analog therapy is associated with a significant reduction in PASP in patients with SCD admitted in ICU with ACS-related ACP."

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a rare group of inherited red blood cell disorders that affect hemoglobin, resulting in serious multi-system complications. The limited number of patients available to participate in research studies can inhibit investigating sophisticated relationships. Secondary analysis is a research method that involves using existing data to answer new research questions. Data harmonization enables secondary analysis by combining data across studies, especially helpful for rare disease research where individual studies may be small. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Cure Sickle Cell Initiative (CureSCi) Metadata Catalog is a web-based tool to identify SCD study datasets for conducting data harmonization and secondary analysis. We present a proof-of-concept secondary analysis to explore factors associated with discontinuation of hydroxyurea, a safe and effective first line SCD therapy, to illustrate the utility of the CureSCi Metadata Catalog to expedite and enable more robust SCD research. We performed secondary analysis of SCD studies using a multi-step workflow: develop research questions, identify study datasets, identify variables of interest, harmonize variables, and establish an analysis method. A harmonized dataset consisting of eight predictor variables across five studies was created. Secondary analysis employed a generalized linear model to identify factors that significantly impact hydroxyurea discontinuation. The CureSCi Metadata Catalog provided a platform to efficiently find relevant studies and design a harmonization strategy to prepare data for secondary analysis. Multivariate analysis of the harmonized data identified that patients who were female, had a history of blood transfusion therapy, experiencing pain, and had the SC sickle cell genotype are more likely to stop hydroxyurea treatment. This secondary analysis provides a template for how the CureSCi Metadata Catalog expedites dataset discovery of sickle cell studies for identifying relationships between variables or validating existing findings."

Modified scoring systems have been developed to assess which pediatric patients would benefit from endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) to treat choledocholithiasis. This study aimed to evaluate the ability of the available criteria to determine which pediatric patients with hemolytic diseases are likely to benefit from ERCP. A secondary analysis was performed using the Pediatric ERCP Database Initiative database, which contains prospectively collected data from 1,124 ERCPs at tertiary-care institutions. We compared patients with a hemolytic disease to those without. Data was analyzed by two-tailed Fisher's exact test and paired student <i>t</i>-test. Of the 47 (17.0%) patients who had a hemolytic disease, 34 (72.3%) had one or more common bile duct (CBD) stones at the time of ERCP. Among patients with hemolytic diseases, there were no differences in pre-ERCP imaging or laboratory findings between those with a CBD stone removed at ERCP and those without. Patients with hemolytic diseases did not fit the current choledocholithiasis selection criteria well: 80% in the no-stone at ERCP group met the American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy high-risk criteria, and 90% met the 2016 modified Baylor pediatric criteria. Although not statistically significant, there was an increased number of adverse events in patients with hemolytic diseases. Existing ERCP criteria perform poorly in patients with hemolytic diseases, overestimating their risk of choledocholithiasis. Peri-procedure evaluations such as endoscopic ultrasound, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography, and intraoperative cholangiography appear underutilized and may be essential modalities in this population."

    "abstract": "To evaluate the presence and progression of maculopathy in patients with sickle cell disease using optical coherence tomography and optical coherence tomography-angiography and to identify clinical/laboratory risk factors for progression during follow-up. Complete ophthalmic examination, including fundoscopy and macular spectral-domain-optical coherence tomography/optical coherence tomography angiography scans, was performed in consecutive patients with sickle cell disease (HbSS/HbSβ 0 /HbSβ + /HbSC genotype) during baseline and follow-up visits. Sickle cell retinopathy stage was based on fundoscopy instead of the Goldberg classification, as fluorescein angiography was not routinely used. Medical/ophthalmological history and hematologic characteristics were retrieved from medical records. One hundred and six eyes of 60 patients were analyzed. The median follow-up period was 34.5 months (range 8-70, interquartile range 25-55). Macular thinning was present in 41 eyes (38.7%) at baseline and in 52 eyes (49.1%) at follow-up. Progression of macular thinning was observed in 25.5% (27/106) of the eyes and sickle cell retinopathy progression in 15.1% (16/106) of the eyes. Predictors for the progression of macular thinning were proliferative retinopathy (adjusted odds ratio 3.40, P = 0.024), lower vessel density in the superior capillary plexus of the inferior parafoveal subfield (adjusted odds ratio 0.88, P = 0.003), and higher vessel density in the deep capillary plexus of the inferior parafoveal subfield (adjusted odds ratio 1.17, P = 0.001). No association was found between the progression of macular thinning and the worsening of other organ damage, sickle cell retinopathy progression, ocular complications, or laser treatment. Sickle cell disease-related maculopathy progresses in many patients without impairing visual acuity during short-term follow-up. Progression of maculopathy is correlated with proliferative retinopathy and vessel densities in inferior parafoveal subfields. Further research is needed to elucidate functional consequences of macular changes."

    "abstract": "Hydroxyurea is the primary disease-modifying therapy for sickle cell disease (SCD), yet adherence is low. Our objective was to identify patterns and predictors of hydroxyurea adherence among Medicaid enrollees with SCD. Children and adults with SCD who received Medicaid benefits between 2009 and 2018 in California were included. Monthly hydroxyurea possession ratios were calculated using filled hydroxyurea prescriptions. Group-based trajectory modeling was applied to identify hydroxyurea possession trajectories and multinomial logistic regression modeling to evaluate predictors of hydroxyurea possession group membership: prior acute care visits due to VOCs, prescriber specialty, and participant sex and age. 713 participants (48% in the 0 to 17 age group, 50% male) had 3 distinct hydroxyurea possession groups: persistently high (n=263, 37%), moderate to low (n=253, 35%), and low to no possession (n=197, 28%). The 18 to 24 and 25+ age groups had greater odds of being in the moderate to low (OR: 2.62, 1.70) and low to no (OR: 3.60, 2.45) than the persistently high possession group compared with the 0 to 17 age group when adjusted for prior VOCs. Children had greater odds of being in the persistently high hydroxyurea possession group compared with young adults and adults, suggesting there are protective factors at this age that promotes better hydroxyurea adherence."

    "abstract": "Transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) screening for primary stroke prevention in children with sickle cell anemia (SCA) was established in higher-resource regions, targeting interventions for highest velocity (\"abnormal\"). We sought to identify additional stroke risk factors in Uganda. We conducted a 30-month open-label single-arm Ugandan hydroxyurea trial, dose-escalated to maximum-tolerated dose, aimed to test brain protection for children aged 3-9 years with SCA. Study procedures included history, clinical stroke examination, and prospective TCD and laboratory assessments. Overall, 264 children received study HU, mean age 5.6 ± 1.7, hemoglobin 7.8 ± 1.2 g/dL, fetal hemoglobin (HbF) 11.9% ± 8.1%, enrolment TCD mean TAMV 148.4 ± 29.3 cm/sec; 15 (5.7%) had abnormal TCD. The mean TAMV at trial completion was 131.9 ± SD 25.7 cm/sec. Four participants without abnormal enrolment TCD developed acute stroke within the initial 16 months (incidence 0.62 per 100 person-years): two had enrolment HbF ≤3.1%, two had low oxygen saturation (90%), and one had recurring severe anemia necessitating multiple transfusions. Apparent stroke precipitants were severe malaria, acute chest syndrome, recent pain crisis, or uncertain cause. At trial completion, eight additional participants had a higher risk TCD category than at enrolment. The effectiveness of TCD screening for stroke prevention may vary by region, as no participant with an incident stroke was at the highest risk. Antecedent and/or ongoing SCA-related risks of anemia, low HbF, hypoxemia, infections, and/or disease complications likely contributed to stroke despite trial HU. Results suggest that TCD alone may not fully identify the highest stroke risk in the region, and there is a need for primary stroke prevention from early childhood and continuous hydroxyurea therapy."

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a chronic hematologic disease associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The study aims to investigate the suggested socio-economic and clinical factors and their contribution to the frequency of pain episodes among sickle cell patients in Uganda. We used pre-existing secondary data from sickle cell clinic records at Mulago referral hospital collected in 2019, with a sample of 2532 sickle cell patients. In support of the outcome being count data, the Negative Binomial Regression model was utilized to estimate how the independent factors affected the frequency of pain episodes among the patients. The frequency of pain episodes was different among age groups as age group (16/24) experienced the highest number of pain episodes on average (Incidence Rate Ratio = 1.39; 95% CI = 1.277-1.522; p = 0.000) compared to young children because as individuals age, pain management declines, and repeated episodes can lead to increased sensitivity, making them more prone to pain. While increased temperature (°C) (fever) increased the frequency of pain episodes by 24% (Incidence Rate Ratio = 1.243; 95% CI = 1.147-1.348; p = 0.000), infection by 27% (Incidence Rate Ratio = 1.27; 95% CI = 1.191-1.354; p < 0.000), other chronic diseases by 11% (Incidence Rate Ratio = 1.11; 95% CI = 1.038-1.188; p < 0.002), malaria by 38% (Incidence Rate Ratio = 1.38; 95% CI = 1.036-1.836; p < 0.027). The rate of hydroxyurea usage was very high at 90%. The intake of the drug reduced the frequency of pain episodes by 34% (Incidence Rate Ratio = 0.662; 95% CI = 0.584-0.750; p < 0.000). According to the observations, there is a high chance that hydroxyurea also had a strong protective against malaria in SCD patients. Nevertheless, there was no evidence that being a male or female would influence the frequency of pain episodes among sickle cell patients. These findings are expected to add to the body of knowledge in the health sector, assist in advocacy programs, inform policy, and aid in tailored interventions."

Inconsistent diagnostic methods and country-specific data gaps hinder current prevalence estimates. This systematic review and meta-analysis aim to provide pooled prevalence estimates and examine geographic and temporal trends in SCA. This systematic review and meta-analysis aim to determine the pooled prevalence of SCA across Africa and analyze its geographic and temporal distribution patterns by synthesizing data from existing studies. We will search four major databases: PubMed, Google Scholar, BASE, and Scopus, for studies on SCA prevalence in Africa published between 1994 and 2024. We will use Zotero to remove duplicates and screen titles and abstracts. We will assess the methodological quality with the JBI critical appraisal checklist for studies reporting prevalence data and extract data using a tested MS Excel form from studies with low to moderate bias. We will use random-effects meta-analysis to calculate pooled prevalence estimates and conduct subgroup analyses for heterogeneity. We will evaluate publication bias with funnel plots and Egger's test, using trim-and-fill analysis if asymmetry is detected. The strength of evidence will be assessed using the AMSTAR (A Measurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews). We expect to find significant variations in SCA prevalence across different regions and age groups, reflecting underlying environmental, diagnostic and methodological factors. We aim to identify any shifts in SCA prevalence and distribution patterns, which could inform future public health strategies and interventions. Our analysis will reveal the pooled prevalence of SCA in Africa, influencing diagnostic, environmental, and methodological factors, guiding targeted public health interventions.

This study examines the impact of protein-energy malnutrition (PEM) on clinical outcomes in hospitalized SCD patients. A retrospective cohort study using National Inpatient Sample data (2016-2020) was performed. Adult SCD patients were stratified by PEM status. Primary outcomes included mortality, length of stay, and hospital charges. Multivariate regression analyses were performed in STATA 17. Among 771,175 SCD patients, 25.9% (20,030) had PEM. More PEM patients were female (57.3%), and PEM was more prevalent in males compared to those without (42.7% vs. 34.3%, p < 0.001). Patients with PEM had higher Charlson Comorbidity Index scores (≥ 3: 42.6% vs. 12.8%, p < 0.001). PEM was associated with increased mortality (aOR 2.66, p < 0.001), longer hospital stays (9.56 vs. 4.79 days, p < 0.001), and higher costs ($100,209 vs. $41,412, p < 0.001). PEM also raised the odds of intubation, pressor support, acute kidney injury, sepsis, blood transfusion, pneumonia, and urinary tract infections (all p < 0.001). PEM is associated with worse outcomes in hospitalized SCD patients, leading to higher mortality, extended stays, and increased costs due to intensive interventions.

This study investigated the prevalence of ASM-UTI and compared urine and hematology parameters among SCD patients in Ghana to their healthy counterparts. In this study, 104 SCD participants (cases) and 80 non-SCD (HbAA) controls were recruited. Participants' information was thoroughly documented using a well-structured questionnaire and patient case records. To achieve the study's aims, a mid-stream urine in a cleaned dry aseptic urine capped container and venous blood were collected for laboratory analysis. The prevalence of ASM-UTI among SCD participants and non-SCD (HbAA) individuals were 22 (21.2%) and 18 (22.5%) respectively. Among the 22 (21.2%) SCD individuals with ASM-UTI, 64% were HbSS and 36% were HbSC<i>. S. aureus</i> 15 (8.2%) accounted for the majority of the organisms isolated with the larger proportion 9(60.0%) isolated from the SCD patients. There was a statistical difference between SCD with ASM-UTI, without ASM-UTI, and non-SCD (HbAA) with respect to urine appearance (<i>p</i> = 0.047), proteinuria (<i>p</i> = 0.024), leukocyte (<i>p</i> < 0.0001). Significantly high total WBC (<i>p</i> < 0.0001), low platelets (<i>p</i> < 0.0001), and low hemoglobin (<i>p</i> < 0.0001) in SCD with ASM-UTI compared to non-SCD (HbAA) with ASM-UTI were also observed. Major risk factors associated with ASM-UTI includes a cloudy urine appearance, a positive (+1 and +2) urine leukocytes and positive (+1) urine bilirubin compared to having a clear urine appearance, negative leukocyte, and a negative bilirubin. This study has shown ASM-UTI to be common in adult SCD participants with higher rate in females. It has also showed that ASM-UTI can exist alongside other clinical states such as anemia, microalbuminuria, hematuria and proteinuria which are characteristics of kidney disease which can trigger crises in SCD participants."

The study included patients diagnosed with SCD and excluded those who had undergone surgery, were females in their menstrual cycle, or were non-SCD patients. Data analysis was performed using SPSS 22.0 software. The highest incidence of SCD was observed in males aged 10 years-20 years and females aged 21 years-30 years. In whole study population, the incidence was 25.67%. Significant differences (<i>P</i> < 0.05) were found between male and female patients in red blood cell (RBC) count, hemoglobin (Hb) levels, white blood cell (WBC) count, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), and packed cell volume (PCV). SCD patients showed lower RBC count, Hb concentration, PCV, and RBC indices but higher WBC counts. Significant gender differences were noted in several parameters. Due to limitations in data recording, mortality could not be thoroughly assessed. The study indicates that malnutrition, stemming from poverty, is a concern, and balanced diets are essential for reducing the incidence and morbidity of SCD."

Oxygen gradient ektacytometry was performed to measure RBC deformability in normoxia and hypoxia, as well as the propensity of RBC to sickle. Voxelotor and dalcetrapib reduced the propensity of RBC to sickle under deoxygenation and increased RBC deformability in hypoxia. Dalcetrapib did not affect the affinity of hemoglobin S (HbS) to oxygen. Combining the two molecules caused greater RBC rheological improvement. Our findings suggest that dalcetrapib could block HbS polymerization without affecting HbS oxygen affinity."

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD and β-thalassemia (BT) affects millions of people worldwide. In addition, around 500,000 infants are born with SCD and 60,000 people are diagnosed with BT every year. Mutations in the hemoglobin subunit beta (HBB) gene are responsible for causing both BT and SCD. Indeed, the diversity of potential mutations in the HBB gene elucidates the diversity in clinical severity observed in individuals with BT and related morbidities. On the other hand, SCD takes place because of the alteration in a single amino acid at position 6 in the beta-globin chain, where a base substitution occurs from glutamic acid to valine, which eventually results in abnormal sickle hemoglobin. Conventional therapies for BT and SCD including pharmaceutical drugs and blood transfusion might temporarily improve the clinical severity of these diseases, however these therapies cannot cure the diseases. CRISPR-Cas9 (CC9) is revolutionizing genome engineering, offering promising therapeutic avenues for genetic diseases. Therefore, CC9-mediated gene therapy provides great hope in the treatment of both BT and SCD. CC9-mediated gene therapy has already demonstrated its effectiveness in correcting both SCD and BT-causing mutations. Moreover, CC9-mediated gene editing was found to be effective in reactivating the expression of hemoglobin F (HbF) and regulating LRF and BCL11A. A number of clinical trials with CC9 gene-edited therapies are being carried out to elucidate their potential in treating BT and SCD. Genetics and pathophysiological mechanisms of SCD and BT, the mechanism of CC9-mediated gene editing, and common delivery methods of the CC9 system have been discussed in this review. Moreover, an in-depth discussion on applications and the current status of CC9-mediated gene editing in SCD and BT along with current challenges and future perspectives have been provided."

Following amustaline/glutathione pathogen-reduced (PR) RBC transfusion, small quantities of PR-RBC surface-bound acridine are detectable by flow cytometry. Concurrent biotin labeling was used to validate the acridine marker and track transfused PR-RBCs in SCD. SCD patients (n = 6) on chronic transfusion therapy received three aliquots of different (2 μg/mL, 6 μg/mL, and 18 μg/mL) biotin-dose labeled RBCs during one transfusion episode. Aliquots were from one unit labeled before (Pre-PR) and after PR treatment (PR-RBC) and from a conventional RBC unit. The full RBC units (PR and conventional) were transfused, followed by the labeled aliquots from those units. Serial flow cytometry analyses for acridine- and biotin-labeled RBCs were performed on 10 occasions over 16 weeks. Acridine surface density was quantitated using calibrated beads. Mean acridine surface density was 5062 molecules/PR-RBC at 1-4 h post-transfusion and declined 84.5% within 7 days, remaining detectable (180 molecules/PR-RBC) at 16 weeks. The biotin-labeled PR-RBC aliquots (initial enrichment 0.6%-1.4%) demonstrated near-identical survival kinetics as the entire acridine-labeled PR-RBC units (initial enrichment 7.5%-13.7%). Pre-PR, PR, and Conventional RBCs revealed non-linear RBC survival kinetics, with similar 24-h post-transfusion recoveries (PTR<sub>24</sub>) and half-lives (T<sub>50</sub>), but PR-RBC mean predicted lifespan (mean [SD] 104.4 [4.7] days) was decreased by 9.3% (Pre-PR-RBCs 115.1 [7.2] days, p = 0.006). Survival of amustaline/glutathione PR-RBCs can be tracked in vivo by flow cytometry for RBC surface acridine with similar sensitivity as biotin, without additional processing or radiolabeling."

    "abstract": "Elevated circulating cell-free hemoglobin (Hb) is a pathological driver of endothelial injury and contributes to disease severity and organ dysfunction during several pathologies, including sickle cell disease, pulmonary hypertension, primary graft dysfunction after lung transplantation, and sepsis. However, the signaling mechanisms involved in Hb-mediated pulmonary microvascular endothelial barrier dysfunction are not well understood. One mechanism by which Hb may contribute to microvascular endothelial barrier dysfunction is through its ability to oxidize circulating lipids and lipoproteins, including low-density lipoproteins (LDLs). In this study, we hypothesized that oxidation of LDL (oxLDL) by Hb (Hb-oxLDL) disrupts the pulmonary microvascular endothelial barrier via the scavenger receptor for oxLDL, lectin-like oxidized LDL receptor 1 (LOX-1). We stimulated primary human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells with Hb-oxLDL and found significant disruption to the endothelial barrier. Barrier dysfunction by Hb-oxLDL was partially prevented by haptoglobin or LOX-1 inhibitor. We also found that oxidation of LDL by heme was sufficient to disrupt the endothelial barrier. Together, these data demonstrate that oxidation of LDL by Hb disrupts the pulmonary microvascular endothelial barrier through the LOX-1 receptor, indicating a potential mechanism for Hb-mediated microvascular injury during inflammatory and hemolytic conditions.<b>NEW & NOTEWORTHY</b> This study demonstrates that oxidation of low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) by hemoglobin or heme disrupts the pulmonary microvascular endothelial barrier; the scavenger receptor lectin-like oxidized LDL receptor 1 mediates this response. This study reveals a novel mechanism by which the pulmonary microvascular endothelium could be targeted for therapeutic intervention during hemolytic or inflammatory pathologies."

There is no reported case of association of EJV aneurysm in a patient with sickle cell anemia. Small aneurysm/pseudoaneurysm, if asymptomatic, are managed conservatively. However, if large or thrombosed, surgical excision is the treatment of choice. Their association with sickle cell anemia makes it a challenge not only for the surgeon, but also for the anesthetist, and requires a planned and disciplinary approach."

    "abstract": "Annexin A1 plays an important role in myocardial defense against ischemia-reperfusion injury. We aimed to evaluate the role of annexin A1 as a potential marker of vasculopathy in children and adolescents with sickle cell disease (SCD) and its relation to myocardial iron content (MIC) and vitamin D status. Forty-one patients with SCD were compared with 40 age- and sex-matched healthy controls, and underwent assessment of serum annexin A1, vitamin D, Doppler echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR). Six (14.6%) SCD patients had cardiac disease, five (12.2%) had abnormal MIC (≥1.16) and 10 (24.4%) had pulmonary hypertension risk. Annexin A1 levels were significantly lower among patients with SCD compared with healthy controls (<i>p</i> < 0.001). SCD patients with pulmonary hypertension risk, evidence of diastolic dysfunction, and nephropathy as well as those with serum ferritin ≥ 2500 µg/L and vitamin D deficiency had lower Annexin A1 levels than those without. Serum annexin A1 levels were negatively correlated to urinary albumin creatinine ratio (UACR) and Tei index while positively correlated to vitamin D among SCD patients. Annexin A1 could be a promising marker of vasculopathy and may provide a biochemical explanation for vitamin D deficiency in SCD."

A prospective longitudinal real-world study was performed with adults with SCD with recurrent VOCs in the US and Europe (France, Germany, Italy, and the UK). Evidence of recurrent VOCs was self-reported (≥ 2 VOCs per year in each of the 2 years before enrolment). Study outcomes were reported at baseline, months 3, and 6 and included self-reported demographics, clinical characteristics, patient-reported outcome measures (EQ-5D-5 L VAS, FACT-G, FACIT-F, 11-point numerical rating scale [NRS] of pain, ASCQ-Me, WPAI), and bespoke questions on financial burden, stigma/prejudice, and time burden associated with SCD. Participants (N = 142) reported an annual mean (standard deviation) of 5.9 (4.8) VOCs requiring hospitalization and 7.5 (7.7) VOCs requiring home management in the past 24 months. Participants reported fatigue and HRQoL impairment, demonstrated by significantly lower baseline EQ-5D-5 L utility and VAS, FACT-G, and FACIT-F scores compared to published information about the US general population. Participants also reported increased pain, stiffness, and emotional impacts compared to a reference sample of adults with SCD on the ASCQ-Me, and most (60%) reported moderate to extreme pain/discomfort on the NRS of pain. Out-of-pocket expenses represented a moderate-to-major burden for 61.9% of participants, with employed participants missing a mean of 9.8 h of work in the last 7 days. Participants reported significant impairments to their HRQoL and financial constraints associated with SCD with recurrent VOCs, indicating humanistic and economic burden and unmet needs in this population."

    "abstract": "To report a secondary multiple evanescent white dot syndrome (MEWDS) case with peculiar indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) findings. Report of a patient with sickle cell disease (SCD) and a longstanding macular hole who developed an atypical form of secondary MEWDS. Analysis of multimodal imaging findings was performed. A 33-year-old female with SCD presented with a longstanding full-thickness macular hole in the left eye, but then was lost to follow-up. Upon her return nine months later, fundus examination revealed new, asymptomatic, yellowish lesions at the level of the outer retina or retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). ICGA showed a peculiar hyperfluorescence in mid-to-late phases, while fundus autofluorescence (FAF) highlighted distinct temporal patterns of hyper-autofluorescence. Some of the ICGA hyperfluorescent lesions displayed a central hypofluorescent core. The multimodal imaging findings suggest a distinct disease or a sequential mechanism in MEWDS pathophysiology. The process may begin with an initial photoreceptoritis, marked by primary self-resolving hyper-autofluorescence on FAF, followed by an early RPE dysfunction with choroidal hyperpermeability evidenced by mid-late phase ICGA hyperfluorescence, then more marked RPE dysfunction shown by late-phase ICGA hypofluorescence and FAF hyper-autofluorescence. This case describes an unusual secondary MEWDS presentation with unique imaging findings. The peculiar ICGA behavior and evolving FAF patterns may suggest either a distinct disease or a shift in our understanding of MEWDS involving photoreceptoritis, early RPE dysfunction, followed by more advanced RPE damage. The findings underscore the need for a nuanced approach to interpreting white-dot syndromes."

    "abstract": "Hemolytic anemias involve premature red blood cell (RBC) destruction and present complex phenotypes, including disturbances in iron metabolism, extramedullary erythropoiesis, and systemic organ involvement. To guide the selection of appropriate murine models for studying pathophysiology and pharmacologic treatments of human hemolytic disorders, we systematically characterized three genetic mouse models commonly used to investigate such conditions: sickle cell disease (SCD), β-thalassemia (THAL), and hereditary spherocytosis (SPH). We sought to clarify how these models differ in the severity and nature of hemolysis, the balance between erythropoietic responses and iron regulation, and the long-term patterns of iron distribution. Our findings reveal that SPH mice exhibit severe intravascular hemolysis and suppressed hepcidin levels, leading to unopposed intestinal iron absorption and extensive tissue iron loading, especially in the liver. In contrast, SCD and THAL mice display predominantly extravascular hemolysis, moderate anemia, relatively stable hepcidin levels, and balanced erythropoiesis with partially regulated iron overload. Single-cell ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing of spleens highlighted distinct erythropoietic progenitor distributions, whereas iron-isotope tracing experiments confirmed divergent RBC turnover kinetics and tissue distribution. This study defines distinct disease trajectories for common hemolytic disease models by providing a unique comparative framework. Our work will support more informed model selection and refined experimental design to investigate hemolytic anemia pathobiology and therapeutics."

    "abstract": "Kidney disorders significantly contribute to morbidity and mortality in sickle cell disease (SCD). Acute kidney injury (AKI), a major risk factor for chronic kidney disease (CKD), often arises from intravascular hemolysis, where plasma cell-free heme drives AKI through inflammatory and oxidative stress mechanisms. Hydroxyurea (HU), a well-established SCD-modifying therapy, improves clinical outcomes, but its effects on systemic heme and inflammatory mediators of kidney injury remain underexplored. This study evaluated HU's impact on plasma heme, pro-inflammatory mediators, kidney injury, and renal histopathology in a sickle cell mouse model. Townes humanized sickle cell mice (HbSS) and non-sickle (HbAA) controls were treated with HU or vehicle for two weeks. HU significantly reduced total plasma heme, lactate dehydrogenase, and pro-inflammatory cytokines (CXCL10, VEGF-A, IFN-γ) in HbSS mice. HU reduced renal injury biomarkers (cystatin C, NGAL) and improved renal histopathology, evidenced by reduced vascular congestion, glomerulosclerosis, and tubular damage. Interestingly, HU did not alter the levels of kidney repair biomarkers (clusterin and EGF). These findings suggest that HU mitigates kidney injury by reducing the deleterious effects of circulating heme and inflammation, supporting its potential to slow or prevent progressive kidney injury in SCD."

The ERN-EuroBloodNet's registry provided real-time registration of SARS-CoV- 2 patients with RBCD, promoting timely disease-specific knowledge sharing during the pandemic's early stages. The study evaluated patient distribution, the infection across different RBCDs, and severity risk factors across similar healthcare systems, using data collected from the ERN-EuroBloodNet's REDCap platform. From April 2020 to April 2023, 681 infections were recorded among 663 patients, of which 373 had transfusion-dependent thalassemia or non-transfusion-dependent thalassemia (TDT/NTDT), and 269 had sickle cell disease (SCD). SCD patients had a higher incidence of COVID- 19 than those with TDT/NTDT (10.5 vs. 4.8 COVID/100 patients). Notably, 92% of the cases were mild, with neither age nor the specific RBCD affecting severity. The number of comorbidities, notably obesity and hypertension, that patients had prior to infection was associated with more severe COVID- 19. During the infection, the presence of vaso-occlusive crises, acute chest syndrome, kidney failure, and ground-glass opacities on chest tomography scans were associated with a more severe clinical picture. The vaccination rate (32%) mirrored that of the general population and showed a protective effect against severe COVID- 19. The observed mortality rate was 0.7%, aligning with Europe's general population. SARS-CoV- 2 infection in SCD and TDT/NTDT patients is mild and without higher mortality than the general population. The ERN-Eurobloodnet's registry collaborative structure exemplifies the power of international cooperation in tackling rare diseases, especially during health emergencies."

Choledocholithiasis in children with SCD is usually secondary to cholelithiasis but, less commonly, can be due to primary choledocholithiasis. A known history of cholecystectomy may lead to a delay in diagnosis of biliary tract pathology in sickle cell patients presenting with abdominal pain. Normal conjugated bilirubin levels may further stray healthcare providers away from considering biliary disease in these patients. Here, we report an unusual case of primary choledocholithiasis in a child with SCD after cholecystectomy with normal conjugated bilirubin at the time of presentation."

    "abstract": "Pain is the most common complication of sickle cell disease (SCD). The underlying biology of SCD pain is not well understood, which is a barrier to novel, effective analgesic and preventative therapies. A wide variability in the phenotypic expression of pain exists among individuals with SCD, despite the inheritance of a similar defective hemoglobin gene. This interindividual pain variability further complicates the ability to understand the biology and effectively treat pain. We sought to discover a biological signature comprised of differentially expressed genes unique to SCD that could differentiate between individuals with varied pain frequency. We conducted plasma-induced transcription analysis from 149 individuals with SCD and 60 Black individuals without SCD from multiple sites. We discovered 3028 differentially expressed genes that underwent Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) to distinguish gene modules significantly associated with pain frequency. We identified 524 genes, significantly associated with pain frequency (≥|0.3| and p<0.05), that were further analyzed using The Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) tool to delineate the biological pathways associated with these genes. The highest ranked gene ontology process from DAVID was inflammatory response (p=1.67E-12) and many related pathways were enriched (e.g., response to lipopolysaccharide, chemokine and cytokine signaling). The top 10 hub genes identified within our biologic signature were TNF, CCL2, ITGAM, ITGAX, ICAM1, CCR5, CXCL2, IFNG, CCR1, CXCL3. Future work should focus on further validating this signature and investigating the potential targets uncovered for their mechanistic and potentially therapeutic role in SCD pain."

    "abstract": "Hydroxyurea is the primary disease-modifying medication for sickle cell anemia (SCA), but its long-term effects, particularly how these effects change over time, are not well understood. This study aimed to quantify the effects of hydroxyurea on clinical and laboratory outcomes in children with SCA over a prolonged period of use. We conducted a quasi-experimental study using contemporary difference-in-differences and dynamic event study analyses on a longitudinal cohort of 2,147 children with SCA (HbSS/HbSβ0) from 2010-2021. Primary outcomes included emergency department (ED) visits per year, hospital days per year, and annual average hemoglobin concentration. Hydroxyurea use was associated with fewer ED visits per year (average treatment effect on the treated [ATT] -0.36 visits/year, 95% CI -0.57, -0.16) and fewer hospital days per year (ATT -0.84 days/year, 95% CI -1.51, -0.17), with sustained effects over time. On average, hemoglobin concentration increased with hydroxyurea use (ATT 0.56 g/dL, 95% CI 0.39, 0.73) but the sustained effect was observed only among the subgroup with laboratory markers of good adherence. This study demonstrates that hydroxyurea has sustained clinical benefits in reducing ED visits and hospital days across years of use in children with SCA. These findings provide perspective for clinicians and families regarding the long-term efficacy of hydroxyurea in pediatric SCA management and underscore the importance of ongoing adherence counseling to optimize clinical benefit. Furthermore, this study design provides a methodological framework for rigorously and causally evaluating other SCA-specific treatments, such as stem cell transplant and gene therapy, in real-world settings."

Advances in treatment have somewhat improved the quality of life and longevity. Therefore, people with SCD/T are now living into their reproductive years. However, pregnant individuals with SCD have a maternal mortality risk of up to 26 times higher than the national average. Individuals with sickle cell trait also have an increased risk of untoward maternal health outcomes. We sought to understand reproductive health concerns among women with SCD/T, through data collected from patients, caregivers, advocates, and healthcare professionals using key informant interviews and focus groups (<i>N</i> = 54). Audio recordings were transcribed verbatim, coded inductively, and analyzed thematically. Three major themes emerged: (1) the Dilemma of Love vs. Risk, (2) SCD/T Knowledge, and (3) the Mental and Emotional Toll of SCD/T. Reproductive concerns and experiences among women with SCD/T influence their mental health and social engagement. Programs are urgently needed that address the unique SCD/T reproductive health risks and communication and support needs. These include readily accessible, age-appropriate SCD/T reproductive health information, counseling, and engaging communication tools for women and their potential partners.

Data on clinical and economic outcomes of patients with SCD receiving frequent RBCTs are limited. This longitudinal, retrospective, claims-based analysis used the Merative™ MarketScan<sup>®</sup> Commercial, Medicare, and Multi-State Medicaid databases. Patients with SCD (identified using ICD-9/10 codes) receiving frequent RBCTs (≥6 RBCTs during any 12-month period) between January 1, 2015, and March 1, 2019, were included. The index date was the date of the sixth RBCT. Eligible patients were required to have ≥12 months of continuous enrollment pre- and post-index. Patients were followed from index to end of enrollment, death, or end of the study period (February 29, 2020), whichever came first. Clinical complications, all-cause healthcare resource utilization (HCRU), and healthcare costs were descriptively summarized during follow-up. A total of 919 patients with SCD receiving frequent RBCTs met the eligibility criteria for inclusion. Patients experienced a mean of 4.0 vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs) per patient per year (PPPY) and received a mean of 8.3 RBCTs PPPY during follow-up. The most common clinical complications were iron overload (77%), infections (66%), and cerebrovascular disease (48%). Patients had a mean of 2.3 inpatient admissions, 83.5 outpatient visits, and 37.4 outpatient prescriptions PPPY during follow-up. Mean total annual healthcare costs were $106,123 PPPY, including mean inpatient, outpatient medical, and outpatient pharmacy costs of $48,463, $28,307, and $29,353, respectively. Compared to those with <2 baseline VOCs, patients with ≥2 baseline VOCs had more HCRU and higher annual healthcare costs. Despite utilizing available care with frequent RBCTs, patients with SCD experienced a variety of disease and transfusion-related complications, including frequent VOCs and iron overload, which led to substantial HCRU and costs. These findings highlight the need for novel therapies for this patient group."

    "abstract": "During red blood cell (RBC) transfusion, production of alloantibodies can promote significant hemolytic events. However, most transfusion recipients do not form anti-RBC alloantibodies. Identifying mechanisms that inhibit alloimmunization may lead to prophylactic interventions. One potential regulatory mechanism is activation of the transcription factor, nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2-like 2 (Nrf2), a master regulatory of antioxidant pathways. Pharmacologic Nrf2 activators improve sequelae of sickle cell disease in pre-clinical models. The Nrf2 activator, 1-[2-cyano-3-,12-dioxooleana-1,9(11)-dien-28-oyl]imidazole (CDDO-Im), suppresses production of inflammatory cytokines including type 1 interferons (IFNα/β), which have been implicated in promoting RBC alloimmunization in transfusion models. Thus, we tested the hypothesis that the Nrf2 activator, CDDO-Im, regulates RBC alloimmunization. Here, we report that CDDO-Im induced Nrf2 activated gene expression and suppressed poly(I:C)-induced IFNα/β-stimulated gene (ISG) expression in human macrophages and murine blood leukocytes. In addition, following transfusion of wildtype mice with RBCs expressing the KEL antigen, CDDO-Im treatment inhibited poly(I:C)-induced anti-KEL IgG production and promoted post-transfusion recovery of KEL+ RBCs, but failed to do so in <i>Nrf2</i> <sup>-/-</sup> mice. Results indicate that activation of the Nrf2 antioxidant pathway regulates RBC alloimmunization to the KEL antigen in a pre-clinical model. If findings translate to other models and human studies, Nrf2 activators may represent a potential prophylactic intervention to inhibit alloimmunization. The antioxidant pathway, Nrf2, inhibits anti-RBC alloantibody responses in a pre-clinical transfusion model.Nrf2 activation may represent a prophylactic strategy to inhibit RBC alloimmunization in transfusion recipients."

A race-stratified group of 3742 patients with DM and no known SCD was included as controls. Data analysis was performed using R (R Project 4.2.0). Descriptive statistics summarized demographic data among patients with comorbid SCD or SCT and among controls. Chi-square tests compared clinical outcomes (proliferative diabetic retinopathy [PDR], diabetic macular edema [DME]) and ocular procedure frequency across patients with DM and SCD or SCT and across controls. Multivariate logistic regression models examined the likelihood of clinical outcomes and ocular procedures across patients with and without comorbid SCD or SCT while adjusting for insurance, smoking status, and demographic factors. Frequency of clinical outcomes and ocular procedures. All measured clinical outcomes were more frequently documented among patients with DM and either SCD or SCT as compared with those with DM alone. Of the 7 ocular procedures studied, 5 were more common among the DM with SCT or SCD group as compared with controls (<i>P</i> < 0.001). On regression analysis, DM patients with comorbid SCD or SCT had 7.36 and 4.22 times greater odds of PDR and DME, respectively (confidence interval for PDR: 6.36-8.54, confidence interval for DME: 3.68-4.85). This analysis suggests that DM patients with comorbid SCD or SCT have an increased likelihood of DM-related microvascular pathology and a higher ocular treatment burden.

We interviewed multiple types of key informants, including family members, healthcare providers, and representatives from national SCD organizations and community-based organizations, and state newborn screening programs. We found that notification and counseling related to SCT are often deprioritized and less timely than for SCD. Few systems track follow-up for these infants and ensure that the results reach families as SCT does not require immediate treatment. Parents reported receiving minimal follow-up and health-related information from healthcare providers. Increasing patient-provider communication about SCT and connecting families to services could have a lasting impact on generational health."

Having adequate knowledge translated into practice has a significant effect on the health of individuals through adoption of positive behaviours and influencing better health seeking behaviours. For those already affected by NCDs, it promotes secondary and tertiary prevention by helping them effectively cope with the disease. In this study, we aimed to determine the level and determinants of NCDs knowledge in the community to inform the implementation of WHO PEN- Plus initiatives. This cross-sectional study was conducted from May to June 2023 involving 528 adults aged 25-64 years from two purposely selected districts and 11, 22 and 528 randomly selected wards, villages, and households respectively. Information on socio-economic, demographic, NCDs knowledge were collected from each participant. Chi-square test and Modified Poisson Regression were applied to assess the association and determinants of NCDs knowledge level. The median age of study participants was 40.5 years. Less than half 42.6%(n=225) were aware of the term NCD and less than one third were aware of the NCD conditions such as Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) 15.3%(n=70), Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) 25.2%(n=133), Rheumatic fever 28.6%(n=151) and Heart failure 33.1%(n=175). Good level of awareness was reported on Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) 79.5%(n=364). More than three quarters of the respondents had low knowledge on T1DM (90.3%), SCD (84.1%), Rheumatic fever (81.3%), NCDs (80.5%) and Heart failure (76.1%). Furthermore, more than half (56.4%) of respondents had low knowledge for T2DM. Adjusted analysis indicated that, for all NCDs except SCD, low knowledge was significantly associated with the district of residence (Kondoa). Low knowledge of NCDs, T2DM, and SCD was significantly associated with having no education, or having only primary or secondary education. Individuals from the lowest, second, middle, and fourth socio-economic status families were significantly associated with low knowledge of NCDs, while the lowest and fourth socio-economic status levels were associated with low knowledge of T2DM and SCD. Low knowledge was observed for all NCDs conditions and socio-economic and demographic characteristics were associated with low knowledge. Interventions to increase NCDs knowledge should consider the socio-economic determinants."

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a complex genetic hemoglobinopathy which is associated with a severely shortened lifespan; the median age of death remains in the low 50's. Individuals living with SCD have complex medical, psychological, and social needs. The complexity results in difficulty navigating the healthcare system, and often being unaware of existing resources that may assist with addressing unmet social needs. Navigating fragmented healthcare and other support systems, as well as ensuring access to care, is challenging for persons with complex chronic diseases such as those living with SCD. Most healthcare institutions do not use SCD-specific nurse navigation models. The purpose is to describe an evidence-based SCD practice model for nurse navigation to improve the quality of whole-person healthcare delivery. Care for individuals with SCD. This disease-focused, nurse navigation model was adapted from effective models and theories. The authors identify and describe nurse navigator competencies, including care coordination, patient education and support, communication, and expertise in SCD care delivery. Each of these competencies is operationalized into core and adaptable intervention components in this model to improve the quality of life and longevity of individuals living with SCD. Nurse navigators are required to understand and manage the care of individuals with complex healthcare needs. The authors identified a comprehensive model that clearly delineates the most effective components of nurse navigation for SCD that can be adopted to a variety of healthcare and community settings to achieve the highest likelihood of meeting whole person healthcare delivery needs.

S. pneumoniae carriage accounted for 32 cases (11%), including 21 penicillin nonsusceptible S. pneumoniae strains (66%). The main serotypes were 23A (n = 4), 35B (n = 4), 11A (n = 3) and 15C (n = 3). Overall, 75% of the serotypes were non-13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) serotypes, with 19% and 53% covered by PCV20 and PCV21, respectively. The carriage rates for S. aureus, M. catarrhalis and H. influenzae were 31%, 17% and 11%, respectively. Methicillin resistance was observed in 5% of S. aureus strains. Age ≤5 years was significantly associated with S. pneumoniae, M. catarrhalis , and H. influenzae carriage, while age ≥11 years was associated with S. aureus carriage. Surveillance of nasopharyngeal carriage in children with SCD is warranted to monitor changes in predominant serotypes and resistance patterns."

    "title": "Improving Health Care Transition for Young Patients With Sickle Cell Disease Through Quality Network.",
    "abstract": "Transitioning from pediatric to adult health care is crucial for the continuity of care for young adults with sickle cell disease. Among 5 pediatric hematology practices participating in the Florida Pediatric Hematology Learning and Action Network, 3 practices lacked transition programs before this quality improvement project. To evaluate the implementation of programs to improve care for individuals transitioning from pediatric to adult care for sickle cell disease. This multicenter observational quality improvement study was conducted at 5 pediatric hematology centers in Florida. All patients with sickle cell disease ages 14 to 21 years without neurocognitive impairment who attended 1 of the 5 centers over the project period were included. Data were analyzed from June 2022 to December 2023. The network participated in virtual learning about quality improvement and the Got Transition health care transition framework. Clinics organized transition programs and used the Model for Improvement and plan-do-study-act cycles. Readiness assessments and transition plans were implemented. Data updates were conducted every month. P-charts were created to present aggregate and individual practice improvement. Percentage of patients with sickle cell disease ages 14 to 21 years attending a clinic at each center with a readiness assessment and a transition plan at least once during the previous 12 months as verified by monthly electronic health record (EHR) audits. Among 627 patients who met criteria for transition implementation because of age and diagnosis, 458 patients were assessed (240 male [52.4%] and 218 female [47.6%]). Collective change initiatives included educating the clinical staff about the health care transition framework, establishing processes for identifying eligible patients using the patient roster, and creating reliable processes and procedures to ensure that patients had a readiness assessment and transition plan. Over the 19-month project, monthly EHR reviews of 100% or a sample of 10 random EHRs demonstrated an increase in the aggregate mean percentage of eligible patients with readiness assessment from 68.8% (95% CI, 63.1%-74.5%) to 87.8% (95% CI, 85.6%-89.5%), representing a 27.6% improvement. The aggregate transition plan increased from 58.8% (95% CI, 53.3%-64.2%) to 81.2% (95% CI, 78.9%-83.5%), with sustained metrics for over 12-month-period. These findings suggest that collaboration among centers was associated with successful achievement of goals. Educating and sharing responsibilities among all center clinicians, identifying patients ahead of time through EHR reviews and clinic-staff huddles, and having electronic versions of readiness assessment and dot phrases to document plans were associated with sustained outcomes."

    "abstract": "Leucine-rich alpha-2-glycoprotein 1 (LRG1) is a novel mediator involved in abnormal angiogenesis. We aimed to investigate circulating LRG1 levels and their relationship with proangiogenic mediators in sickle cell disease (SCD). A total of 50 patients with SCD, with 25 in steady-state condition (SCD-SS) and 25 in periods of painful vaso-occlusive crisis (SCD-VOC), and 25 healthy controls were included in the study. Demographical and clinical data were collected from hospital records. Serum LRG1, vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), and hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF1A) levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and C-reactive protein (CRP) was measured by the nephelometric method. Routine biochemical parameters were assessed using an autoanalyzer. Multinomial logistic regression was used to analyze ELISA parameters, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed to determine the optimal cut-off point for HIF1A to predict VOCs in SCD patients. LRG1 and VEGFA levels were significantly higher in SCD patients than controls (p<0.001), with no difference between the SCD-SS and SCD-VOC groups. HIF1A, CRP, and lactate dehydrogenase levels differed significantly across all groups, being highest in the SCD-VOC group (p<0.001). After adjusting for age and sex, LRG1, HIF1A, and VEGFA remained elevated in the SCD groups. HIF1A correlated with CRP (r=0.351, p=0.024), but LRG1 showed no correlation with proangiogenic mediators in the SCD-VOC group. The area under the ROC curve was calculated as 0.694 (95% confidence interval: 0.542-0.845, p=0.021) and the optimal cut-off point was 494.5 pg/mL for HIF1A in predicting vaso-occlusive crises in patients with SCD. Circulating LRG1 levels may reflect neutrophil activation and contribute to the cross-talk between proangiogenic mediators released in SCD."

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) persists as a major global health problem, disproportionately affecting children in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). Accurate and low-cost point-of-care techniques are urgently needed in LMIC to detect carrier or disease forms with haemoglobin S (HbS) and other variants like β-thalassemia. An open-label, international, multicentre study was conducted at clinical sites in Nepal and Canada. Blood samples were collected from healthy volunteers (HbAA) and participants with known haemoglobinopathies (HbA/β-thalassemia, HbAS, HbS/β-thalassemia, HbSS). The performance of six low-cost tests (Conventional sickling test; HbS solubility test; HemoTypeSC; Sickle SCAN; Gazelle Hb variant test; Automated sickling test using automated microscopy and machine learning) was evaluated against HPLC (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05506358). Between September 2022 and March 2023, we enrolled 138 participants (aged 2-74 years; 59% female, 41% male) at clinical sites in Nepal and Canada. Four low-cost tests (HemoTypeSC, Sickle SCAN, Gazelle, and automated sickling), which could identify phenotypes, detected severe SCD (HbSS, HbS/β-thalassemia) accurately (sensitivity >96%; specificity >99%). In contrast, for carrier forms, HemotypeSC and Sickle SCAN only detected HbAS (sensitivity >97%; specificity 100%) and not HbA/β-thalassemia (sensitivity 0%; specificity 100%), while Gazelle detected HbAS (sensitivity 100%, specificity 100%) and HbA/β-thalassemia (sensitivity 91%, specificity 99%), and automated sickling test detected both trait conditions (HbAS and HbA/β-thalassemia; sensitivity 85%, specificity 85%). When HbS co-exists with β-thalassemia, Gazelle and automated sickling test accurately identify severe SCD and carrier forms. However, HemotypeSC and Sickle SCAN miss β-thalassemia trait, and need to be complemented with other low-cost tests.

    "abstract": "Vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) pain episodes often occur with menses and concurrent hormonal contraceptive use may reduce their frequency. This study tested the hypothesis that among women with sickle cell disease (SCD), sex hormones are associated with pain detection thresholds. Women with SCD aged minimum 18 years with regular menses, and without acute illnesses, pregnancy, oophorectomy, or hormonal contraceptive use within three months prior were included. Pain detection thresholds for heat (HPT) and pressure (PPT), and serum estradiol, progesterone and testosterone were measured at follicular and luteal phases. The Adult Sickle Cell Quality-of-Life Measurement Information System assessed quality-of-life and VOC frequency and severity scores. Generalized linear mixed models were performed, including the day of the cycle standardized by cycle length. Among 125 participants, neither the day nor phase of the menstrual cycle was associated with PPT or HPT. In multivariate analyses, worse VOC scores (<i>β</i> = 1.7) and severe genotype (<i>β</i> = -46.0) were associated with higher and lower trapezius PPT, respectively. Older age was associated with lower forearm HPT (<i>β</i> = -0.1). Among leg measurements, ovulatory cycles (<i>β</i> = -1.1) and hydroxyurea use (<i>β</i> = -1.2) were associated with lower HPT, while worse VOC scores (<i>β</i> = 0.1) were associated with higher HPT. Higher estradiol was associated with lower HPT at the leg (<i>β</i> = -0.02), with an interaction with the cycle day (<i>β</i> = 0.001) predicting lower thresholds earlier in the cycle for the same estradiol level. Estradiol is associated with a time-varying, length-dependent small-fiber neuropathy among SCD women; and may be a potential therapeutic target and biomarker for SCD pain."

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a chronic illness accounting for 134,000 hospital admissions annually. Youth with SCD and youth with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) experience health disparities, yet the hospitalization outcomes of these youth have not been assessed. This study aimed to (i) determine the prevalence of ASD and selected neurodevelopmental disabilities (NDD) among hospitalized youth with SCD and (ii) compare hospitalization outcomes in youth with selected NDD and SCD to youth with SCD. ICD-10 diagnosis codes were used to identify admitted youth (2-18 year olds) with SCD, ASD, and selected NDD (i.e., developmental delay) in the Pediatric Health Information System (October 2015 to April 2024). Demographic (age, race) and clinical variables (length of stay, intensive care unit [ICU] admission, 30-day readmissions, hydroxyurea use, genotype) were assessed. Among 16,369 unique inpatients diagnosed with SCD (54.7% hemoglobin SS, median age = 11.9 years, and 86.4% non-Hispanic Black), 2.6% were diagnosed with a selected NDD; 1.7% were diagnosed with ASD. Hydroxyurea use during hospitalization did not differ between groups (3.3% vs. 3.5%; p = 0.19). Individuals with selected NDD had significantly higher annualized rates of hospitalization (0.88 vs. 0.65; p < .0001), ICU admission (0.12 vs. 0.05; p < .0001), and 30-day readmissions (20.2% vs. 17.4%; p = 0.0004) compared to youth without these neurodevelopmental diagnoses. The median length of stay in both groups was 3 days. Youth with selected NDD and SCD are at an increased risk of frequent and complicated hospitalizations. Additional research should investigate how inpatient and outpatient care delivery can be tailored and optimized to reduce the frequency and severity of hospitalizations."

An IRB-approved mixed-method survey of barriers to HSCT in SCD was given to parents, caregivers, and adolescents obtaining care at the Children's of Alabama/University of Alabama at Birmingham Comprehensive Pediatric Sickle Cell Clinic. We performed 103 surveys; 97 surveys (94%) were completed by a parent/guardian/caregiver, and 6 (6%) were completed by the patient. The most common SCD complication reported was three or more yearly pain crises (43%). Most (57%) respondents heard about HSCT from their healthcare provider. The most important concern with HSCT identified by respondents (67%) was the possibility of end-organ damage with the potential to worsen over time. The greatest barrier for respondents (77%) was a 5% chance of death with HSCT. Other barriers identified include the risk of reversible or permanent organ damage (73%), HSCT failure (54%), and infertility (42%). Respondents identified barriers to HSCT; however, they are not insurmountable. Provider education regarding the benefits and potential risks of HSCT with a clear explanation of mitigation strategies can improve acceptance of HSCT among the SCD population."

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited hemolytic-hemoglobinopathy that affects the ability of erythrocytes to deliver oxygen in the body. Hydroxyurea is a pharmacologic agent that has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of SCD crises since 1998. It has also been proposed as a therapy for recurrent ischemic priapism (RIP), recurrent prolonged or unwanted erections in the absence of sexual stimulation, which occurs commonly in SCD. The premise behind hydroxyurea's therapeutic effect is that it improves vascular function and hemoglobin metabolism. Its potential role in RIP is to normalize the nitric oxide (NO) signaling pathway, which is fundamental for the regulatory physiology of the erection response. Hydroxyurea has been investigated in diverse research studies, including a recent clinical trial, showing its potential benefit for treating RIP. In this article, we performed a scoping review of the effectiveness of hydroxyurea for the treatment of SCD-associated RIP."

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and opioids are often used to manage pain in this setting. This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluates the effectiveness of ketorolac, a NSAIDs, in managing acute pain in children in the ED, comparing its efficacy and potential advantages over other pain management options. The search was conducted in PubMed and Web of Science, for English-language articles published from 1991 to February 2023. Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the analgesic effect of ketorolac in commonly painful conditions such as migraine, traumatic and non-traumatic musculoskeletal pain, abdominal pain, and renal colic treated in the ED were included. Pediatric studies were specifically selected. A meta-analysis was subsequently conducted to compare efficacy of ketorolac with other analgesic medications. Eight RCTs have investigated the efficacy of ketorolac for acute pain in children in the ED, reflecting limited pediatric evidence. Ketorolac showed variable effectiveness for conditions such as migraine, musculoskeletal trauma, acute abdominal pain, renal colic, and vaso-occlusive crisis in sickle cell disease. The meta-analysis revealed no significant differences in analgesic performance between ketorolac and other drugs, including opioids and other NSAIDs. The risk of bias across the studies was evaluated. However, the evidence remains insufficient to confidently recommend a specific intervention, highlighting the need for further research to guide clinical decision-making.Conclusion: Despite its limitations, the systematic review highlights that ketorolac seems effective for managing acute pain in pediatric ED patients, but not superior to other analgesic drugs. It emphasizes the necessity for further research to define optimal dosing, administration methods, and its comparative effectiveness with other analgesics across various clinical scenarios."

    "abstract": "Despite proven efficacy, only 70% of eligible individuals in the U.S. are vaccinated against <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i>. This is especially concerning for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD), as they are susceptible to invasive pneumococcal disease owing to functional asplenia. Early and complete vaccination is crucial in preventing pneumococcal sepsis and its complications, including the rare but often fatal fat embolism syndrome. Here, we report a case of an adolescent male with Hemoglobin SC (HbSC) disease who presented to our pediatric emergency department (ED) with abdominal and back pain. Notably he had received all vaccinations according to published guidelines, however had not yet received the expanded pneumococcal vaccine. He was in his usual state of health the previous day. He arrived to the ED mildly febrile, tachypneic, and tachycardic with altered mental status. His condition rapidly deteriorated into acute respiratory failure, coagulopathy, and multiorgan dysfunction syndrome. Unfortunately, he succumbed following multiple cardiac arrests less than 12 hours into his illness course. This case highlights to pediatric and adolescent providers that invasive pneumococcal disease remains a significant risk for vaccinated, adolescent patients, even with mild SCD genotypes. Moreover, it underscores the critical importance of early, complete pneumococcal vaccination in SCD patients. The newer expanded pneumococcal vaccines could enhance protection for this vulnerable population."

A simple depression questionnaire \"Child depression inventory 2\" was proposed and completed by a clinical examination and consultation by a psychologist. Using the known assessment of health inequalities and poverty in health screening centres (EPICES) score, we developed a composite precariousness score that uses five items (each item is scored from 0 to 2). According to the chosen items, precariousness was defined as a score ≥5. <b>Results:</b> The prevalence of depression was 42.5% [95% CI: 31.5-54]. The median age was 15 years [95% CI: 13-17]. The age distribution peaked at 14 years in patients with depression. There were 76% of precarious patients in the depressed group and 18% in the control group (<i>p</i> < 0.0001). In multivariate analysis, genotype SC (OR = 7.66, [1.17; 50.13], <i>p</i>=0.0338) and precariousness (OR = 15.68, [4.73; 51.94], <i>p</i> < 0.0001) were associated with higher rates of depression.

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a prevalent hemoglobinopathy that leads to various complications, including hepatobiliary diseases, which are often underrecognized. Cholelithiasis and choledocholithiasis, resulting from accelerated pigment gallstone formation due to increased hemolysis, are common in SCD patients. This case series aims to raise awareness of the heightened risk of biliary disease in SCD and emphasize the need for early screening and management strategies. We present four cases of adult SCD patients who developed gallstones, each requiring medical intervention for biliary complications. The first case involved a 47-year-old woman with SCD and choledocholithiasis, presenting with right upper quadrant pain and jaundice. She underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) for stone removal. The second case described a 25-year-old woman with a history of SCD, who had hyperbilirubinemia and dilated common hepatic duct. She successfully underwent ERCP and laparoscopic cholecystectomy after cholelithiasis was confirmed. The third case involved a 34-year-old man with acute abdominal pain and right-sided testicular pain, diagnosed with gallstones and early cholecystitis. Despite plans for surgery, he signed out against medical advice. The fourth case was a 28-year-old woman with recurrent acute chest syndrome, who presented with abdominal pain and was found to have multiple gallstones. She underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy, but developed acute chest syndrome postoperatively, requiring exchange transfusion. All patients experienced post-surgical recovery, although one patient had complications related to acute chest syndrome. Hepatobiliary manifestations in SCD include cholelithiasis, choledocholithiasis, and other liver-related issues. The formation of pigmented gallstones is a direct result of chronic hemolysis, where increased bilirubin levels contribute to stone formation. The incidence of cholelithiasis in SCD patients is significant, with factors such as hemoglobin levels and bilirubin elevation increasing the likelihood of gallstone formation. Symptomatic gallstones often present with right upper quadrant pain, which can be exacerbated by vaso-occlusive crises. Early intervention, including elective cholecystectomy, can help prevent complications like choledocholithiasis, biliary colic, and cholecystitis. Despite a lack of formal guidelines for routine cholecystectomy in asymptomatic patients, evidence supports early surgical management to prevent further complications and reduce the need for emergent procedures. This case series highlights the importance of early screening and elective cholecystectomy for SCD patients at risk of biliary disease. Early intervention can prevent acute complications, reduce hospitalizations, and improve the quality of life for patients with SCD. Future research and guidelines should focus on establishing protocols for screening and management of gallstone-related hepatobiliary complications in this population."

This observational study was carried out in 384 cases advised for screening of haemoglobin disorders by HPLC. All the cases were subjected to both HPLC and modified sickle cell paper solubility test simultaneously. The results of both the test were compared accordingly. Further to check the minimum level of HbS that can be identified by paper solubility test, a sample dilution method was used and analyzed. Out of 384 cases, 131 cases were found to have an HbS window in the HPLC report and rest 263 cases were found to have either normal or other haemoglobin variants. The paper solubility test also showed the similar results with 100% of sensitivity and specificity. Further, a > 5% of HbS can be traced and identified by paper solubility test. The paper-based haemoglobin solubility test was seen to be capable of distinguishing sickle cell patients from non sickle cell blood samples with a high degree of accuracy. It is a very rapid test that can be performed by a person with minimal training at community level (field study). The paper based Hb Solubility test is a low cost, easy, rapid, accurate, point of care and reproducible screening test for sickle cell patients."

    "abstract": "Vaso-occlusive pain crisis (VOC) is recognized as a prominent complication of sickle cell disease, accompanied by debilitating pain and serious consequences for patients, making it the primary cause of visits to hospital emergency departments. In the etiology of VOC, the intricate interaction of endothelial cells, hypoxia, inflammation, and the coagulation system is pivotal. Hemoglobin S polymerization under hypoxic conditions leads to the formation of rigid and adhesive red blood cells that interact with vascular endothelial cells and other blood cells, causing occlusion and subsequent inflammation. Hemolysis of red blood cells results in anemia and heightened inflammation, whereas oxidative stress and involvement of the coagulation system further complicate matters. In this review, we strive to examine the pathophysiology of VOC from these mentioned aspects by consolidating findings from various studies, as a comprehensive understanding of the causes of VOC is essential for the development of targeted therapeutic interventions and the prevention and management of pain, ultimately improving the quality of life for patients."

Necrotizing cavitary pneumonia, a rare but severe complication, poses significant diagnostic challenges in patients with SCD. We report a 27-year-old male with SCD and history of pulmonary infarction from pulmonary embolism who presented with bilateral wrist pain, cough, and chest pain and was found to have necrotizing cavitary pneumonia. Initial imaging revealed significant right upper lobe cavitary consolidation. Despite negative sputum cultures, blood cultures identified <i>Staphylococcus epidermidis</i> and <i>Granulicatella</i>, atypical pathogens in pneumonia cases. Pain crisis treatment and treatment with antibiotics for pneumonia displayed significant improvement in symptoms. Our case highlights the necessity of considering unusual pathogens in SCD patients presenting with pneumonia, particularly those with prior pulmonary complications. Infections remain a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in SCD, underscoring the importance of rapid diagnosis and tailored management. Vigilant monitoring of cavitary lesions and prompt recognition of atypical pathogens can mitigate risks of severe pulmonary complications and improve patient outcomes.

    "abstract": "Health literacy (HL) is known to be low among those with sickle cell disease (SCD). Reproductive health knowledge gaps exist among those with SCD, which drove the research team to create an education tool for adolescent males entitled, 'Fertility edUcaTion to Understand ReproductivE health in Sickle cell disease' (FUTURES) in 2023. This study sought to evaluate and revise FUTURES using HL tools and a community-advised review to improve clarity, understandability, actionability, and relatability. Four evaluators conducted a HL assessment of the original and revised FUTURES programs using the Patient Education Assessment Tool for Audio/Visual Materials (PEMAT-AV) and the modified Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Clear Communication Index (CDC-CCI-modified). Paired samples t-tests were used to compare PEMAT-AV and CDC-CCI-modified scores between the original and revised versions of FUTURES. Community advisory board feedback identified opportunities to improve program design. HL assessment revealed high HL demand of the original FUTURES program. The revised program had significantly higher understandability and clarity scores and was re-designed to be more engaging and representative of the intended audience. However, the CDC-CCI-modified score fell below the recommended threshold and actionability remained unchanged. This study outlined an approach that prioritized HL and community voices when revising an education tool, which could be used in future efforts to design accessible and relatable patient education materials for this population and others. More work is needed to evaluate the impact of the HL revision process on patient knowledge and outcomes for this and other at-risk patient populations."

    "title": "Assessment of Inter-Reader Reliability of Fazekas Scoring on Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Brain in Adult Patients with Sickle Cell Disease.",
    "abstract": "<b>Background/Objectives</b>: Cerebral white matter disease is a common finding in patients with sickle cell that has been linked to cognitive impairment. However, there is no standardized approach for quantification of the cerebral disease burden. The Fazekas score is widely used to quantify the burden of white matter disease in chronic small vessel disease. However, its utility in sickle cell disease, specifically the inter-rater variability, has not been established. <b>Methods</b>: A patient cohort was compiled for the purpose of a research ethics board (REB)-approved retrospective study of adult patients with sickle cell disease, each of whom underwent MRI/MRA between the years 2017 and 2019. A total of 90 such patients were captured. All MRI/MRA studies were performed on three Tesla MRIs. Two independent neuroradiologists assessed the axial FLAIR MRI brain sequence (see image 1) for each of the 90 patients, with the sole focus of assigning a Fazekas score (0-3) to each study as a means of quantifying the burden of ischemic white matter lesions. The neuroradiologists were blinded to the scoring assigned by their counterpart and to the clinical information. After the initial assessment was completed, studies with discrepant Fazekas scores were documented and discussed by both readers. A consensus Fazekas score was then assigned to each of these studies. <b>Results</b>: Cohen's weighted kappa was used as a measure of agreement between readers. The expected agreement was 74.65%, with an observed agreement of 94.44% between readers, with a kappa of 0.7808. <b>Conclusions</b>: We conclude on the basis of our study that there is good inter-reader reliability of Fazekas scoring on axial FLAIR MRI brain sequence in patients with sickle cell disease. The Fazekas is a promising measure that could easily be integrated in systematic evaluation of cerebrovascular lesions of adults with sickle cell disease."

    "abstract": "Academic proficiency is crucial for advancing learning goals, school advancement, and future economic security. Children with sickle cell anemia (SCA) in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) may be at risk of disease-associated learning difficulties. Limited data exist on this topic among school-age children in the region. We aimed to assess academic proficiency in a sample of children with SCA in Uganda compared with unaffected controls. This cross-sectional study was conducted in Kampala, Uganda. Participants were school-going children with SCA, aged 6-12 years, attending Mulago Hospital SCA Clinic, and age-matched sibling controls without SCA. Academic proficiency was assessed by the Wide Range Achievement Test, Fourth Edition (WRAT4) using outcome measures of spelling, mathematical computation, word reading, and sentence comprehension by age-normalized z-scores. Among 68 children with SCA and 69 controls tested; the mean age for each group was 9.4±2.0 years; 38 (55.9%) with SCA and 32 (46.4%) controls were male. Mean hemoglobin was 7.9 ± 0.9 g/dL for the SCA group versus 12.8 ± 1.0 g/dL for controls (p < 0.001). Compared with the control sample, children with SCA scored significantly lower in mathematical computation (median [interquartile range]: -0.47 [-1.11 to 0.08] versus -0.02 [-0.46 to 0.61], p = 0.0012). Spelling but not mathematic proficiency decreased with age in the SCA group. No significant differences by group were found in spelling, word reading, or sentence comprehension. School-aged children with SCA are at risk of poor academic proficiency, especially in mathematical computation. Our findings suggest that children with SCA in Uganda need educational evaluation and may benefit from support for learning."

    "title": "The role of nucleation in sickle cell pathophysiology: opportunities for innovative treatments.",
    "abstract": "Sickle cell anemia (SCA) is driven by the polymerization of hemoglobin S (HbS), where the nucleation process plays a central role in initiating sickling episodes. Advances in structural biology and computational modeling have significantly deepened our understanding of this process. High-resolution crystallography has elucidated the structural changes in deoxygenated HbS that promote nucleation, revealing critical interactions between valine-substituted β-globin chains. Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has provided detailed visualizations of early-stage polymerization, capturing the formation of small HbS aggregates, which are essential for understanding the dynamics of nucleation in physiological conditions. Additionally, computational modeling has offered valuable insights into the kinetics of HbS nucleation, enabling the prediction of polymer formation under varying oxygen tensions. Molecular dynamics simulations have been instrumental in identifying key factors that modulate nucleation, such as intracellular HbS concentration, pH, and ionic strength. These simulations also suggest that heterogeneous nucleation, facilitated by cellular surfaces or macromolecules, may accelerate the sickling process, highlighting potential therapeutic targets for disrupting this interaction. Together, these techniques have led to new opportunities for innovative treatments. For instance, voxelotor, a drug developed using structural insights, binds to HbS and prevents its deoxygenation, reducing nucleation rates. Other strategies, such as CRISPRbased gene editing and allosteric modulators, are emerging as potential therapeutic avenues for altering nucleation kinetics, offering hope for more effective treatments to mitigate the clinical severity of SCA."

    "abstract": "Sickle cell anemia (SCA) is a genetic blood disorder characterized by recurrent pain episodes, chronic complications, and significant emotional and physical stress. This review article explores effective strategies for managing both the emotional and physical aspects of stress in SCA patients. A comprehensive literature search was conducted across multiple databases, including PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar, using keywords such as \"sickle cell anemia\", \"stress management\", \"psychological support\", and \"pain management\". Emotional stress in SCA arises from chronic pain, frequent hospitalizations, and disease uncertainty, leading to conditions such as anxiety and depression. Effective management of emotional stress involves a combination of psychological counseling, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), and support groups, which help patients develop coping strategies and address the mental health challenges of living with a chronic illness. This review evaluates various psychological interventions and their impact on patient outcomes, emphasizing the need for integrated mental health support in the management of SCA. Physical stress in SCA is primarily due to acute vaso-occlusive crises and chronic pain, which require effective pain management and preventive measures. The review explores pharmacological treatments, such as opioids and hydroxyurea, as well as nonpharmacological approaches, including physical therapy and lifestyle modifications. Additionally, the article discusses innovative therapies like gene therapy and stem cell transplantation, which hold promise for long-term disease management."

We aimed to assess the relationship between malaria infection and micronutrient biomarker concentrations in pre-school children (PSC), school-age children (SAC) and women of reproductive age (WRA) in Malawi and examine the potential role of malarial immunity on the relationship between malaria and micronutrient biomarkers. Data from the 2015/2016 Malawi micronutrient survey were used. The associations between current or recent malaria infection, detected by rapid diagnostic test and concentration of serum ferritin, soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR), zinc, serum folate, red blood cell folate and vitamin B<sub>12</sub> were estimated using multivariable linear regression. Factors related to malarial immunity including age, altitude and presence of hemoglobinopathies were examined as effect modifiers. Serum ferritin, sTfR and zinc were adjusted for inflammation using the BRINDA method. Malaria infection was associated with 68 % (95 % CI 51, 86), 28 % (18, 40) and 34 % (13, 45) greater inflammation-adjusted ferritin in PSC, SAC and WRA, respectively (<i>P</i> < 0·001 for each). In PSC, the positive association was stronger in younger children, high altitude and children who were not carriers of the sickle cell trait. In PSC and SAC, sTfR was elevated (+ 25 % (16, 29) and + 15 % (9, 22) respectively, <i>P</i> < 0·001). Serum folate and erythrocyte folate were elevated in WRA with malaria (+ 18 % (3, 35) and + 11 % (1, 23), <i>P</i> = 0·01 and <i>P</i> = 0·003 respectively).

    "abstract": "Cognitive impairment is a common and dreaded complication of sickle cell disease (SCD), profoundly affecting patients' quality of life, education, and employment. Despite its significance, there is a striking lack of guidance on optimal screening strategies, with existing tools often skewed by biases related to language proficiency and educational background, leaving many patients undiagnosed and unsupported. The Rowland Universal Dementia Assessment Scale (RUDAS) was specifically designed for cognitive screening in multicultural populations. We hypothesized that in adults with SCD, RUDAS performance is less influenced by educational attainment when compared to the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). We conducted a cross-sectional study of adults with SCD who underwent cognitive screening at the Henri-Mondor Hospital using RUDAS and MoCA. Educational attainment was scored as the years of schooling for the highest completed diploma (HLE). Abnormal RUDAS (<28) and MoCA (<26) scores were found in 55/73 (75.3%) and 52/73 (71.2%). Both scores increased significantly with HLE (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Adding 1 point for those with the HLE < 12 years significantly mitigated the effect of education on RUDAS but only partially for MoCA (<i>p</i> = 0.26 and <i>p</i> = 0.003). In an independent cohort of 252 adults, this adjustment for HLE significantly lessened the effect of education on RUDAS. These results suggest there is an educational bias in neurocognitive screening of adults with SCD. We propose that the RUDAS adjusted for HLE is a promising novel strategy to systematically identify those in need of comprehensive neurocognitive assessment."

    "abstract": "Patients with sickle cell disease were presumed to be at high risk for severe COVID-19 outcomes due to their compromised immunity and chronic comorbidities. This study aimed to evaluate vaccination patterns, healthcare utilization, and clinical outcomes in a cohort of sickle cell disease patients during the COVID-19 pandemic in Rio de Janeiro. A total of 289 over 18-year-old patients from the Epidemiology and Donor Evaluation Study (REDS-III) Brazil sickle cell disease cohort were followed between January 2021 and August 2023. Sociodemographic data, emergency department visits, hospitalizations, mortality rates, and COVID-19 vaccination status were collected. SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction testing for symptomatic or hospitalized patients. Of the participants, 89.2% completed the primary vaccination schedule, 62.2% received the first booster, 30% the second booster, and 4.1% completed all five doses. Emergency visits increased slightly during the pandemic but were primarily due to vaso-occlusive crises. Of the 119 patients tested for SARS-CoV-2, six were positive, presenting mild symptoms with no COVID-19-related deaths. Vaccination rates in the cohort were similar to those in the general population, with Oxford/AstraZeneca and Pfizer being the most used vaccines. The findings suggest that COVID-19 infection was not a significant trigger for vaso-occlusive crises or severe disease outcomes. High vaccination adherence likely played a key role in preventing severe COVID-19, alongside other factors such as social isolation and herd immunity. However, the overlap between symptoms of vaso-occlusive crises and COVID-19 may have caused diagnostic challenges. Importantly, the low morbidity and mortality observed emphasize the protective effect of vaccines, despite the presence of thromboplastic activity and pro-inflammatory states inherent to sickle cell disease. Addressing vaccine hesitancy remains crucial, particularly as booster doses show declining adherence. COVID-19 had a limited clinical impact on this cohort, with no significant role in triggering vaso-occlusive crises or severe outcomes. High vaccination rates and potential environmental or biological factors may have contributed to this protective effect."

    "abstract": "Patients with sickle cell disease hospitalised for acute chest syndrome (ACS) are at high risk of in situ pulmonary microthrombosis. We evaluated whether therapeutic anticoagulation could shorten ACS duration. TASC is a randomized, controlled, double-blind trial conducted in 12 French hospitals (December 2016-April 2021) in adult ACS patients with no initial thrombosis on chest computerised tomography with pulmonary angiogram. We randomised 172 patients (1:1) to receive either prophylactic or therapeutic doses of low-molecular-weight tinzaparin for 7 days. The primary efficacy outcome was time to ACS resolution. The primary safety outcome was major bleeding. Main secondary outcomes included parenteral opioids consumption, transfusion, mortality at hospital discharge, and hospital readmissions at 6 months. The primary efficacy outcome, time to ACS resolution, analysed using a Cox model, was shorter with therapeutic anticoagulation than with prophylactic doses (hazard ratio 0.71; 95% CI: [0.51-0.99]; p=0.044). As a supplemental estimate, the restricted mean time to ACS resolution (over a 15-day horizon or discharge) was shorter with therapeutic doses (4.8±0.4 vs 6.1±0.5 days). The primary safety outcome (major bleeding) did not occur in either group. The cumulative dose of parenteral opioids was lower with therapeutic anticoagulation: (124 [80;272] vs 219 [65;378] mg morphine equivalent, difference: -96, 95%CI: -202 to -46, p=0.02). Other short- and long-term secondary outcomes were similar between groups. In adult patients with ACS, a therapeutic anticoagulation shortened ACS duration and reduced opioids consumption compared with prophylactic doses, without increasing bleeding risk.

Unlike CRISPR-Cas9 systems that induce double-strand breaks, ABEs operate through precise deamination, avoiding chromosomal instability. However, the off-target editing effects of ABEs remain inadequately characterized. In this study, we present a biochemical method Selict-seq, designed to evaluate genome-wide off-target editing by ABEs. Selict-seq specifically captures deoxyinosine-containing single-stranded DNA and precisely identifies deoxyadenosine-to-deoxyinosine (dA-to-dI) mutation sites, elucidating the off-target effects induced by ABEs. Through investigations involving three single-guide RNAs, we identified numerous unexpected off-target edits both within and outside the protospacer regions. Notably, ABE8e(V106W) exhibited distinct off-target characteristics, including high editing rates (>10%) at previously unreported sites (e.g. RNF2 and EMX1) and out-of-protospacer mutations. These findings significantly advance our understanding of the off-target landscape associated with ABEs. In summary, our approach enables an unbiased analysis of the ABE editome and provides a widely applicable tool for specificity evaluation of various emerging genome editing technologies that produce intermediate products as deoxyinosine."

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a hemoglobinopathy that affects over 30 million individuals worldwide. When significant \"sickling\" occurs, blood flow to specific organs can be impaired, resulting in ischemia or infarction. This can be problematic during intracranial surgery, in which low systemic circulatory volume due to significant blood loss can lead to intracranial hypotension. Using a multivariable modeling approach, we gathered a large patient dataset through a nationally representative database to inform future neurosurgical management of patients with concurrent SCD and pituitary adenoma. We queried the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project Nationwide Readmissions Database and implemented discharge weighting to identify a cohort of SCD patients who had undergone surgical resection of pituitary adenoma between 2015 and 2016. Variables investigated included patient age, sex, length of stay, postoperative complications and outcomes, payment methods, and median income, among several others. Retrospective analysis identified 19,612 non-sickle cell patients (NSCP) and 41 SCD patients. Complication profiles for the SCD cohort demonstrated significantly higher rates of postoperative pulmonary embolism (<i>P</i> = 0.042) and pneumonia (<i>P</i> = 0.005) compared to those of the NSCP cohort. In addition, the SCD cohort trended toward higher rates of readmission (15.25% vs. 9.76%) and deep vein thrombosis, although neither achieved statistical significance (<i>P</i> = 0.45 and 0.07, respectively). SCD is a severe disorder that affects many individuals worldwide and represents a significant risk factor for complications and adverse outcomes in pituitary adenoma surgery. Further research is needed to explore SCD as a risk factor in pituitary surgery and the role it may play in perioperative complications."

A descriptive, cross-sectional design was employed. In this study, 298 nurses aged between 21 and 53 years from 10 hospitals in the northern and middle regions of Jordan completed a structured, self-reporting questionnaire. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used for data analysis. Nurses identified 12 perceived barriers to optimal pain management in children with SCD. The top three barriers included workload (mean rating of 7.29/10), absence of psychological support for children (mean rating of 7.13/10), and insufficient time (mean rating of 6.83/10). A lack of knowledge and training about SCD pain was also recognized as a significant barrier. Regarding nurses' perceptions of their understanding of SCD in children, less than half (41%-46%) believed they had adequate knowledge. Only 23% of nurses had received education on pain management, and only 6% had received structured education on caring for patients with SCD. System-related challenges, such as heavy workloads and limited time, were significant obstacles that prevented healthcare providers from prioritizing pain management for children with SCD. To reduce delays in SCD-related pain care and improve health outcomes, nursing policymakers, administrators, and educators must implement multilevel strategies to address the identified barriers to optimize pain management in children with SCD."

While the transfer typically occurs at age 18, some pediatric providers continue care into adulthood. This study evaluates whether remaining in pediatric care versus transferring to adult care affects health outcomes. We hypothesized that those who remain in pediatric care after age 18 would experience fewer acute health-care events and better outcomes than those who transfer to adult care. A retrospective cohort study was conducted at HEMORIO, a blood center in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Health-care utilization (outpatient visits, emergency department visits, hospitalizations), hydroxyurea use, care abandonment, and mortality were compared among young adults with sickle cell disease aged 18-23 under pediatric or adult care. Wilcoxon rank sum tests and Fisher's exact tests were used for statistical analysis. Among 472 eligible patients (50% female, 71% Hb SS or Hb Sβ0 thalassemia), 81 (17%) remained in pediatric care, while 391 (83%) transferred to adult care. After age 18, patients in pediatric care had fewer emergency visits and hospitalizations compared to those in adult care. Transferred patients showed increased emergency visits and hospitalizations relative to their adolescent period, whereas those remaining in pediatric care experienced reduced rates of these events. Transitioning to adult care is associated with increased adverse outcomes despite more frequent ambulatory visits. Enhancing transition programs to improve adult care integration and engagement is essential to address these disparities."

Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) have additional risk factors such as vaso-occlusive crises, chronic hemolysis, and susceptibility to infections, which further complicate diagnosis. We report the case of a 14-year-old male patient with SCD who presented with severe generalized abdominal pain, vomiting, and progressive distension with no fever. Imaging revealed significant colonic dilation and pneumatosis, suggesting pseudo-obstruction or ischemic bowel. Infectious evaluations ultimately identified enteropathogenic Escherichia coli. Despite initial concern for toxic megacolon, a multidisciplinary evaluation by hematology, gastroenterology, infectious disease, and surgery confirmed acute colonic pseudo-obstruction associated with enterocolitis. The patient's condition was managed nonoperatively with nasogastric decompression, intravenous antibiotics, total parenteral nutrition, and prokinetic agents. Serial imaging demonstrated gradual improvement in colonic distension, facilitating a safe return to oral feeding and subsequent discharge. This case underscores the importance of early recognition of enterocolitis-associated colonic pseudo-obstruction in patients with SCD, highlighting the value of comprehensive infection screening and a careful, multidisciplinary management approach to avoid unnecessary surgery and improve outcomes."

    "abstract": "Despite the established efficacy of hydroxyurea (HU) in increasing fetal hemoglobin (Hb F) levels in patients with intermedia beta-thalassemia (β-thal) and sickle cell anemia, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying these effects remain largely elusive. Understanding these mechanisms is paramount for identifying alternative therapeutic approaches to increase Hb F production while minimizing adverse effects. In this study, we employed weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to investigate the molecular underpinnings of γ-globin switching within GSE90878 dataset. Leveraging this information, we aimed to predict the transcriptome network and elucidate the mechanism of action of HU and Metformin (Met) on this network comprehensively. Through bioinformatic analysis, we identified IGF2BP1 and GCNT2 as key regulators of the γ-globin switching mechanism. To experimentally validate these findings, we utilized the K562 cell line as an erythroid model. Cells were treated with HU (50, 100, and 150 µM) and Met (50, 100, and 150 µM) for 24, 48, and 72 h. The expression levels of the GCNT2, γ-globin, IGF2BP1, miR-199a/b-5p, miR-451-5p and miR-144-3p were quantified using real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Our results revealed that treatment with HU (150 µM), Met (100 µM), and combination of HU-Met (150/100 µM) significantly increased IGF2BP1 expression by 6.2, 5.3, and 7.1-fold, respectively, after 24 h treatment. Furthermore, treatment with HU (50 µM), Met (50 µM) and HU/Met (50/50 µM) for 24 h led to a 3.3, 1.2, and 5-fold decrease in GCNT2 gene expression, respectively. Notably, the highest levels of γ-globin expression and Hb F production were observed with HU (100 µM), Met (50 µM), and HU/Met (100/50 µM). This study provides compelling evidence that HU and Met significantly enhance γ-globin expression and Hb F production in the K562 cell line. Our findings suggest that these drugs exert their effects by modulating the expression of IGF2BP1 and GCNT2, thus offering valuable insights into potential therapeutic strategies for disorders characterized by low Hb F levels."

We have identified MLL1 complex as a critical regulator of fetal and embryonic hemoglobin repression. Knockdowns of <i>MEN1</i> and <i>KMT2A,</i> encoding essential components of the complex, caused a significant downregulation of <i>BCL11A</i> expression and a substantial increase in γ- and ε-globin mRNA levels in HUDEP-2 cells. Significant binding of MEN1 and KMT2A were readily detected at the promoter and a critical enhancer of <i>BCL11A</i> in HUDEP-2 cells, suggesting that <i>BCL11A</i> is a direct transcriptional target of MLL1 complex. Consistent with these results, <i>MEN1</i> or <i>KMT2A</i> knockdown in normal human CD34 <sup>+</sup> hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) induced to undergo erythroid differentiation also significantly decreased their <i>BCL11A</i> expression and increased their γ- and ε-globin expression and the production of F cells in the culture. Treatment of these cells with MENIN inhibitors yielded similar results and promoted erythroid differentiation with minimal effects on their growth. These findings underscore a critical role of MLL1 complex in regulating fetal and embryonic hemoglobin expression and suggest that MENIN inhibitors could offer a promising therapeutic approach for sickle cell disease and β-thalassemia."

We present the acquisition and quality of genetic and disease-associated data and present an analytical framework for using this resource. In partnership with a community advisory council, we have co-developed a valuable framework for data use and future research."

    "title": "Low-cost optical sensors in electrified lab-on-a-disc platforms: liquid-phase boundary detection and automated diagnostics.",
    "abstract": "Centrifugal microfluidic platforms are highly regarded for their potential in multiplexing and automation, as well as their wide range of applications, especially in separating blood plasma and manipulating two-phase flows. However, the need to use stroboscopes or high-speed cameras for monitoring these tasks hinders the extensive use of these platforms in research and commercial settings. In this study, we introduce an innovative and cost-effective strategy for using an array of light-dependent resistors (LDRs) as optical sensors in microfluidic devices, particularly centrifugal platforms. While LDRs are attractive for their potential use as photodetectors, their bulky size frequently restricts their ability to provide high-resolution detection in microfluidic systems. Here, we use specific waveguides to direct light beams from narrow apertures onto the surface of LDRs. We integrated these LDRs into electrified Lab-on-a-Disc (eLOD) devices, with wireless connectivity to smartphones and laptops. This enables many applications, such as droplet/particle counting and velocity measurement, concentration analysis, fluidic interface detection in multiphase flows, real-time monitoring of sample volume on centrifugal platforms, and detection of blood plasma separation as an alternative to costly stroboscope devices, microscopes, and high-speed imaging. We used numerical simulations to evaluate various fluids and scenarios, which include rotation speeds of up to 50 rad/s and a range of droplet sizes. For the testbed, we used the developed eLOD device to analyze red blood cell (RBC) deformability and improve the automated detection of sickle cell anemia by monitoring differences in RBC deformability during centrifugation using the sensors' signals. In addition to sickle cell anemia, this device has the potential to facilitate low-cost automated detection of other medical conditions characterized by altered RBC deformability, such as thalassemia, malaria, and diabetes."

    "abstract": "There is a lack of data evaluating the impact of tourniquet versus no tourniquet surgery in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). The records of 233 sickle cell patients who underwent orthopaedic surgery with a tourniquet between 1978 and 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. This study group (233 patients) was compared to a control group of 574 SCD patients followed by the same surgical team in the same hospital undergoing the same procedures in the same period between 1978 and 2018 but without a tourniquet. Outcomes assessed skin complications, thrombophlebitis, bone necrosis, muscle necrosis or abnormal muscle function, peripheral nerve impairment, elevated blood pressure, post-operative sickle cell crises, and blood loss under a tourniquet. The pneumatic tourniquet was primarily applied proximally in both lower and upper limbs. The median tourniquet duration was 65 minutes, with most procedures lasting between 30 and 90 minutes . Postoperative medical complications occurred in both groups, with no significant difference in hospital stay (6.7 vs. 7.1 days). Painful sickling crises affected 86 patients, with a lower prevalence in transfused patients (p = 0.04). Blood loss was significantly lower in the tourniquet group during knee surgeries (438 ml vs. 731 ml, p = 0.031), resulting in fewer transfusions. Skin complications did not affect wound healing. The 90-day incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) was 0.4%, with no significant difference between groups. Muscle biopsies showed no necrosis immediately post-surgery, but some necrosis appeared after 12 weeks in the tourniquet group. New bone osteonecrosis cases and infection rates were similar between groups. this study provides valuable insights into the use of tourniquets in sickle cell disease."

    "abstract": "Sickle cell anemia and beta-thalassemia are the major hemoglobinopathies associated with anemia. Bone marrow transplants or blood transfusion are frequently employed as treatment for these diseases, and erythropoietin analogues are sometimes used to boost erythropoiesis to compensate the destruction of RBCs. RBCs of hemoglobinopathy patients have reduced pyruvate kinase activity and increased oxidative stress, which makes the RBCs prone to destruction and precipitate vaso-occlusive crises and pain. The objective of this study was to evaluate desidustat, a hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) stabilizer in beta thalassemic mice (B6.D2-Hbb<sup>d3th</sup>/BrkJ) model, phenylhydrazine-induced acute hemolysis in C57 mice model, and sodium metabisulfite-induced sickling in sickle cell disease patient's blood. Desidustat treatment increased hemoglobin, RBCs, and hematocrit in both mice models. Desidustat treatment decreased iron overload, splenomegaly, and oxidative stress in phenylhydrazine-induced hemolytic anemia in mice. Desidustat treatment increased pyruvate kinase activity in RBCs of human, mice, and rats in a dose-dependent manner, and reduced sickling in SCD patients' RBCs. These data indicate that desidustat stimulates pyruvate kinase and attenuates oxidative stress in red blood cells, causes erythrocytosis in thalassemic mice, and reduces sickling in sickle cell patient's blood."

    "abstract": "Alopecia areata (AA) is an autoimmune hair loss disorder characterized by sudden hair shedding due to immune dysregulation involving the Janus Kinase - Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (JAK-STAT) pathway. JAK inhibitors (JAKi) have demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials, but data from real-world settings remain scarce. This retrospective, single-centre cohort study evaluated the real-world effectiveness and safety of JAKi (abrocitinib, baricitinib, ritlecitinib, upadacitinib, and tofacitinib) in 72 patients treated between December 2017 and February 2024. Patients had a mean age of 34 years and a mean disease duration of 8 years. At time points 3, 6, 9, 12, and 18 months substantial regrowth was observed in 18 (25%), 28 (38.9%), 25 (34.7%), 22 (30.6%), and 19 (26.4%) patients respectively. Over a median follow-up of 16 months, 61% achieved substantial regrowth at a median time of 7 months. At 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, the cumulative regrowth rates were 11.1%, 40.2%, 55.6%, and 59.7%, respectively. Among non-responders who switched medications, 75% achieved substantial regrowth. Two serious adverse events occurred (sickle cell crisis and renal failure with pre-existing dysfunction). The findings indicate that JAKi are effective and safe for AA treatment in real-world settings. Further prospective studies are necessary to optimize treatment guidelines."

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a monogenic blood disorder characterized by neurodevelopmental delays. Most children with SCD do not receive developmental services due in part to disparities in care access. To inform the design of a developmental intervention for children with SCD, we evaluated factors that influence access to developmental services. Interview data were collected from educational and medical providers (<i>n</i> = 15) and caregivers (<i>n</i> = 15) of children aged 4-6 years with SCD at a single center and the surrounding area. Caregivers completed questionnaires about their child's background/medical history, caregiver depression (PROMIS SF v1.0-8a), and caregiver knowledge of early development (Knowledge of Infant Development Inventory). A convergent design was used to integrate the qualitative and quantitative data. We identified three themes as factors that influence caregivers' access to developmental services: quality of medical and educational experiences, caregiver knowledge and beliefs about SCD and development, and caregiver preferences for developmental services. Most caregivers denied barriers to obtaining developmental services for their child, whereas providers acknowledged numerous barriers for families. Caregivers and providers shared that a positive caregiver-provider relationship facilitates access. Caregivers reported that there was limited attention to SCD within the hospital system and broader society. Caregivers displayed limited knowledge of early development, and providers identified these knowledge gaps as a barrier to utilizing developmental services. Caregivers expressed a strong interest in SCD education and community building. Our mixed method analysis identified barriers and facilitators to developmental services for children with SCD."

    "abstract": "Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a hematologic malignancy with a poor prognosis, often presenting with systemic and extramedullary manifestations. Leukemia cutis (LC), the infiltration of leukemic cells into the skin, is a rare and clinically significant complication of AML. It often signals extramedullary disease involvement, may precede systemic relapse, and is associated with poor survival outcomes. We report the case of a 36-year-old female with AML who developed recurrent, reddish-brown nodular skin lesions on the face, trunk, and extremities, consistent with LC. Despite achieving initial remission with induction and consolidation chemotherapy, she experienced early LC recurrence, pancytopenia, hepatobiliary dysfunction, and infectious complications, underscoring the aggressive nature of her disease progression. Disease progression was confirmed by bone marrow evaluation, which revealed 60% blasts. Despite intensive chemotherapy, antimicrobial prophylaxis, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor support, the patient's condition deteriorated due to refractory disease. This case suggests that LC may serve as a possible early marker of AML relapse, underscoring the importance of timely recognition and intervention. Multidisciplinary management and early diagnostic reassessment are essential to improving outcomes in such patients. Further research is needed to explore novel treatment strategies for AML patients with LC, aiming to enhance survival and disease control."

    "title": "Investigation of Sickle Cell Retinopathy in Pediatric and Adolescent Patients Enrolled in a Large Cohort Study.",
    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease results in vaso-occlusion and hemolysis, leading to ophthalmic and systemic complications. In the eye, these processes initiate retinal ischemia and neovascularization resulting in sickle cell retinopathy (SCR). Hydroxyurea therapy increases fetal hemoglobin (reducing ischemia), and chronic blood transfusions (CTXN) reduce strokes in children with abnormally high intracranial vessel velocities. It is not known if these treatments reduce retinopathy. Our hypothesis is that hydroxyurea and CTXN lower the risk of the development and slow the progression of retinopathy. Using a large longitudinal cohort study, we determined the prevalence of SCR among pediatric and adolescent patients with sickle cell disease and the effects of disease-modifying therapy on reducing the prevalence and severity of sickle cell retinopathy. We included all eye examinations of participants (age 10-18 at time of initial eye exam) at a single site from the Sickle Cell Research and Intervention Program cohort between October 2010 and September 2022. Patients without a dilated eye exam were excluded. At 10 years of age, yearly ophthalmologic assessments began for patients with hemoglobin SC disease and every other year for other sickle cell genotypes. Two ophthalmologists reviewed all 2237 eye examination results. We obtained patient age, sex, sickle genotype, treatment received for sickle cell retinopathy, duration of exposure to sickle cell disease-modifying therapy, and hematologic indices (fetal hemoglobin and hemoglobin concentration) and abstracted data regarding SCR, severity grading, and treatment. We observed that pediatric and adolescent patients with sickle cell disease receiving hydroxyurea therapy were 29% less likely to demonstrate SCR. Of those receiving hydroxyurea, 107 of 351 patients (30%) had SCR as compared with the 118 of 279 patients (42%) not receiving hydroxyurea (P = 0.0028). Patients receiving CTXN were 68% less likely to develop SCR. Of those, 20 of 121 patients (17%) had retinopathy as compared with the 205 of 509 patients (40%) not receiving CTXN (P < 0.001). Our data from one of the largest cohorts of pediatric and adolescent patients with sickle cell disease support widespread use of hydroxyurea, CTXN, or both. We found that these therapies are associated with a smaller number of patients demonstrating SCR.

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a multifactorial disease characterized by a high incidence of morbidity and mortality due to chronic hemolysis, inflammation and oxidative stress. Recent studies have highlighted the crucial role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in regulating key pathophysiological processes in SCD, including high levels of fetal hemoglobin production, and reduction in inflammation and cellular adhesion. This comprehensive review discusses the current understanding of miRNAs in SCD, including their potential as biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Furthermore, despite substantial evidences indicating that malaria exacerbates SCD, the review will explore the complex interplay between miRNAs and SCD, with a focus on the exacerbating effects of malaria on SCD severity. Understanding the complex interplay between miRNAs and SCD may lead to the development of novel therapeutic interventions aimed at ameliorating disease severity and improving patient outcomes. Future prospects, challenges and safety concerns related to miRNA-based therapies, highlighting the need for further research."

    "abstract": "Albuminuria is associated with high-risk apolipoprotein-L1 variants (APOL1 G1/G2) in patients with sickle cell anemia (SCA). However, this gene variant does not account for all chronic kidney disease (CKD) risk. We hypothesized that we could develop a polygenic risk score (PRS) for CKD in SCA, combining APOL1 G1/G2 with other candidate genes that modify SCA severity and further stratify patients into risk categories based on this risk score. Variants in APOL1, HMOX1 (rs743811), BCL11A (rs1424407), and α-thalassemia (α <sup>-3.7</sup>) were identified in children with SCA enrolled in the Sickle Cell Clinical Research and Intervention Program longitudinal cohort (SCCRIP). We individually tested the association of these variants with persistent albuminuria, tested a three-variant PRS (PRS-3) (APOL1, BCL11A (rs1424407), and α<sup>-3.7</sup>), and developed a four-variant PRS (PRS-4) after adding HMOX1 (rs743811) to PRS-3 using the summation of high-risk alleles. An adult SCA cohort from the University of Illinois, Chicago (UIC), was used for validation. Persistent albuminuria was defined as having a urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) ≥ 30 mg/g on at least 2 of 3 consecutive measurements. In both cohorts, APOL1 risk variants increased the risk while α-thalassemia protected against persistent albuminuria. PRS-4 was significantly associated with persistent albuminuria (SCCRIP: p = 0.004; UIC: p = 0.00016). When stratifying patients into three and four risk categories based on the PRS, 58% and 86% of the high-risk (PRS-3) and 54% and 89% of very high-risk (PRS-4) categories developed persistent albuminuria cases in the SCCRIP and UIC cohorts, respectively. A PRS may identify high-risk SCA patients for albuminuria. Applying this PRS to guide the early implementation of disease modifiers and renoprotective therapies may help reduce the burden of SCA-related CKD. Trial Registration: NCT02098863."

    "abstract": "Cases of flea-borne spotted fever (FBSF) have been on a steady increase in the southern United States and produce the highest numbers of reported vector-borne disease cases in Texas. Historically, cases were largely murine typhus caused by Rickettsia typhi and characterized by exposure to rodent fleas. However, more recently, spotted fever rickettsiosis caused by R. felis and characterized by exposure to the cat flea, Ctenocephalides felis, may be the dominant disease. We describe the management of a child with a complex clinical picture, including sickle cell β-thalassemia, bullous pemphigoid, and initially diagnosed with murine typhus infection. We also explain the clinical response to a case cluster of FBSF (R. felis) among a military family residing in on-post housing and the quantitative polymerase chain reaction testing of associated flea samples to confirm the pathogen species. This case cluster highlights some of the important challenges faced in managing the re-emergence of FBSF in the United States including: (1) difficulty diagnosing FBSF, (2) lack of resources to determine the specific pathogen involved, (3) vertical transmission of R. felis in fleas, and (4) the importance of effective coordination between medical providers and public health personnel with pest management professionals to ensure effective control of the fleas. FBSF presents a risk to the health and morale of military personnel stationed in the region and potentially a risk to operational effectiveness."

The lower legs are typically affected, but especially in the presence of acral skin changes, occlusive cutaneous vasculopathies should also be considered. Various stimuli can trigger occlusive cutaneous vasculopathies, including systemic or vascular coagulopathies, emboli, platelet or erythrocyte aggregates, cold-dependent gelling and agglutination of immunoglobulins, or, less commonly, medications."

    "abstract": "Physical activity (PA) is indispensable for overall health. Sub-optimal PA is linked to reduced quality of life (QOL) and premature death. In clinical research and therapeutics development, defining aspects of PA that are meaningful to patients and care providers is essential for designing tailored interventions, identifying individual contextual factors, and enhancing patient satisfaction and engagement in their own well-being. As digital health technologies (DHTs) measuring PA rapidly evolve, there is an opportunity to further define concepts. A systematic review of qualitative studies to identify concepts of PA that are meaningful to patients and care providers was conducted. Conditions covered included Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cancer, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, chronic heart failure, sickle cell disease, osteoarthritis, and sarcopenia. We analyzed studies published in the last 20 years utilizing qualitative or mixed methods techniques to describe aspects of PA that patients want to prevent from worsening or improve. Among the 5228 articles returned, 105 studies were included. Thematic synthesis revealed five meaningful aspects of health (MAH) related to PA: ambulation-dependent activities, balance-dependent activities, activities needing upper limb function, changing body positions, and participating in activities of different intensities. Patients also reported PA as important to QOL and influenced by internal and external facilitators and barriers. This research presents new findings related to PA MAHs across various therapeutic areas, which go beyond walking. The findings provide a foundation for defining concepts of interest, measures, and endpoints, with applications in clinical research and care, including patient-focused development of digitally derived measures."

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a severe genetic disorder causing anemia, pain, and organ damage, affecting millions globally. Voxelotor, approved in the United States in 2019, targeted sickle cell disease pathophysiology. Despite its therapeutic benefits, concerns remain regarding its long-term safety and potential side effects, including headaches and gastrointestinal disturbances. This study used the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) to assess voxelotor's safety, aiming to enhance treatment strategies and clinical decision-making in SCD management. In this study, we utilized the FAERS to extract voxelotor-related adverse event reports from 2019 to 2024. We conducted descriptive and disproportionality analyses using four algorithms: Reporting Odds Ratio (ROR), Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR), Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN), and Multi-item Gamma Poisson Shrinkage (MGPS) to identify significant adverse event signals. The reliability of voxelotor adverse drug reactions (ADRs) was further improved by comparing with hydroxyurea ADRSs. Finally, adverse reactions were divided into acute ADRS, delayed ADRs and efficacy related reports to analyze the adverse event onset time. A total of 16,677,340 case reports were collected in the FAERS database, of which 20,902 reports related to voxelotor were identified. Voxelotor induced adverse events occurred in 27 system organ categories (SOC). Key system organ classes affected were the blood and gastrointestinal systems. Notably, some adverse events, such as priapism and osteonecrosis, were not listed on the drug's label. The median adverse event onset time of acute ADRs, delayed ADRs and efficacy related reports were 1, 189.5 and 271 days, respectively. This study systematically analyzed ADRs of voxelotor, highlighting the need for ongoing monitoring and further research on voxelotor's long-term safety and efficacy in treating sickle cell disease."

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a chronic inflammatory condition characterized by hemoglobin polymerization that precipitates recurrent vaso-occlusion, endothelial dysfunction, and multi-organ damage. Menstruation in persons with SCD presents a unique challenge due to blood loss and its ability to exacerbate SCD pain. This interaction between SCD-related vascular stress and menstruation-induced inflammation amplifies the risk of acute pain episodes during menstruation. In this manuscript, we explore the intersection of SCD and menstruation, emphasizing the role of hormonal therapy in managing menstruation-associated acute SCD pain. Progestin-only therapies, such as depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) and levonorgestrel intrauterine devices (LNG-IUDs), are particularly effective in reducing menstrual blood loss. Data suggests DMPA mitigates acute SCD pain episodes around menstruation with minimal thrombotic risk in persons with SCD. Despite their effectiveness in menstrual regulation, combined hormonal contraceptives (CHCs) pose a significant concern due to their potential to exacerbate the hypercoagulable state in individuals with SCD. We highlight the importance of comprehensive care and collaboration between gynecologists and hematologists to optimize the management of menstruation-associated SCD pain."

Relaxation and/or distraction interventions may reduce stress, pain, and opioid use in outpatients with SCD. There is limited information regarding challenges and strategies for successful recruitment, retention, and data collection for a relaxation and/or distraction study in this population. The authors examined recruitment, retention, and data collection challenges for the participants in a study of an internet-based guided relaxation intervention to devise strategies to address them. Qualitative data from an ongoing 6-month randomized controlled trial of a relaxation intervention was used. Participants (N = 122) had a mean age of 33.4 ± 10.6 years (range = 18-65), were mostly African American (93%) and female (68%), and were enrolled between March 2021 and May 2024 in collaboration with SCD clinics and communities. Participants completed baseline measures and were randomized to control or experimental groups. Research specialists documented all participant-reported challenges. Of 122 participants who completed the study, 65 (53%) reported 126 occurrences of challenges: 15 (12%) reported internet issues, 27 (21%) reported technical difficulties with the web-based program or Galaxy tablet, 4 (3%) reported problems using medication devices, 21 (17%) reported trouble adhering to specific data entry time windows, 39 (31%) had missing data points due to hospitalization, and 20 (16%) reported overwhelming pain at home. Several targeted strategies were used to overcome these challenges. Findings provide insights into the challenges encountered in study recruitment, retention, and data collection when assessing adult outpatients with SCD. Addressing these challenges through targeted strategies, including practical team training, active engagement with participants, and efforts to add recruitment sites, can enhance recruitment, retention, and data collection in this population."

This retrospective observational study evaluated the utility of the ratio of pulse oximetry oxygen saturation (SaO2) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (SaO2/FiO2) in adult patients with ACS and its association with the clinical outcome of intensive care unit (ICU) transfer. Across all ACS hospitalizations at a tertiary medical center from 2017 to 2021, we characterized the SaO2/FiO2 ratio at 3 time points: emergency department (ED) presentation, ACS diagnosis, and antibiotic initiation. Of the 227 hospitalizations identified, 54% were female, the mean age was 29 years, 70% had hemoglobin SS, and 9% had obesity. Although ICU transfer was not strongly associated with the SaO2/FiO2 ratio at ED presentation (area under the curve [AUC], 0.59), it was strongly associated with the ratio at ACS diagnosis (AUC, 0.73) and antibiotic initiation (AUC, 0.74). Given the highest sensitivity at ACS diagnosis, a diagnostic SaO2/FiO2 cutoff of 310 was proposed for triaging likely ICU transfer (sensitivity, 63%; specificity, 82%; adjusted odds ratio, 8.94; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.12-37.6; adjusted hazard ratio, 4.86; 95% CI, 1.91-12.4), with models adjusted for obesity, lung disease, and blood counts. This cutoff corresponds to an SaO2 acquired from pulse oximeter saturation <90% on 2 L/min nasal cannula support. We propose using the SaO2/FiO2 ratio cutoff of 310 prospectively as a simple bedside triage tool for adult patients with sickle cell disease hospitalized with ACS to be transferred to a higher level of care."

    "abstract": "Despite advances in the treatment of sickle cell disease (SCD), an inherited disorder leading to abnormal sickle hemoglobin (HbS) polymerization, patients continue to have a shorter life expectancy comparatively to the general population. Increase in the concentration of oxygenated HbS in red blood cells (RBCs) has been considered as a novel approach to inhibit HbS polymerization and reduce RBC sickling and their complications, raising interest for novel oxygen affinity modulators. This review summarizes the characteristics and primary results obtained with osivelotor, a novel oxygen affinity modulator, for the treatment of SCD. Osivelotor is presented with improved pharmacokinetic properties comparatively to voxelotor. It may enable higher hemoglobin (Hb) occupancy at lower doses potentially leading to significant improvements of clinical outcomes. The first clinical phase 2/3 trial with osivelotor reported increases of Hb levels and RBC counts, and decrease of RBC sickling. The treatment was apparently well tolerated. However, osivelotor shares the same mechanism of action as voxelotor, and therefore similar limitations regarding its efficacy for which the improvement in Hb level appears misleading. Several issues remain to be resolved before considering any drug approval."

Among the drugs used, hydroxyurea (HU) seems to have produced good results according to some studies. This molecule has not yet been evaluated in the DR Congo for this purpose. To evaluate albuminuria and the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) after 9 months of HU treatment in a population of children with incipient sickle cell nephropathy. This was an open clinical trial involving sickle cell syndrome children under 18 years of age followed by incipient sickle cell nephropathy (glomerular hyperfiltration =GHF and/or microalbuminuria). A mean HU dose of 20 mg/kg/d was administered to each child, with quarterly clinical and biological controls. GHF (new Schwartz formula) was defined as a rate > 130 ml/min/1.73 m2 for girls and > 140 ml/min/1.73 m2 for boys; albuminuria was defined as the albuminuria/creatinuria ratio (ACR) in mg/g. The Wilcoxon and McNemar tests were used to compare the results at admission and at the 9th month of treatment. In total, 30 children (mean age 8.9±4.1 years; 40% boys) whose mean fetal hemoglobin (HbF) level increased from 10±7.4 to 18.8±4.9% (p˂0.001), whose mean number of blood transfusions ranged from 7.4±6.7 to 0.1±0.3 bags/month (p˂0.001), and whose number of VOCs ranged from 1.8±1.1 to 0.2±0.4/month (p˂0.03) were included.

This multicentre case-control study recruited 60 SCA participants and 30 controls (HbA), aged 2-34 years, from Tamale Teaching Hospital; Methodist Hospital, Wenchi; and Seventh Day Adventist Hospital, Sunyani, Ghana, between the periods of March to July 2023. About 4 mL of blood was collected for a full blood count using a haematology analyzer and serum ERFE, hepcidin, ferroportin, and ferritin estimation using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Data were analyzed using SPSS Version 26.0. ERFE (<i>p</i> < 0.001), ferroportin (<i>p</i> = 0.016), ferritin (<i>p</i> < 0.001), serum iron (<i>p</i> < 0.001), transferrin (<i>p</i> = 0.001), soluble transferrin receptor (sTFR) (<i>p</i> = 0.019), TWBC (<i>p</i> < 0.001), and platelet (<i>p</i> < 0.001) were significantly higher in SCA participants and hydroxyurea-naïve participants than in the control group and hydroxyurea-treated participants, respectively. Levels of hepcidin (<i>p</i> < 0.001), red blood cell (<i>p</i> < 0.001), haemoglobin (<i>p</i> < 0.001), and haematocrit (<i>p</i> < 0.001) were lower in the SCA and hydroxyurea-naïve groups than in the control and hydroxyurea-treated groups, respectively. An inverse correlation was observed between serum ERFE and hepcidin (<i>r</i> = -0.391, <i>p</i> = 0.002) and hepcidin and ferroportin (<i>r</i> = -0.266, <i>p</i> = 0.040), while ferritin (<i>r</i> = 0.439, <i>p</i> < 0.001) and ferroportin (<i>r</i> = 0.309, <i>p</i> = 0.016) showed a positive correlation with ERFE. No correlation was found between serum hepcidin and ferritin levels (<i>r</i> = 0.025, <i>p</i> = 0.853). Again, participants with regular blood transfusions had significantly higher levels of ERFE (<i>p</i> < 0.001) and ferritin (<i>p</i> = 0.002) than those with rare and no transfusions per year. None of the SCA participants had done iron testing. In conclusion, the negative impact of ERFE on hepcidin levels may exacerbate the risk of iron burden, as evident by elevated iron levels in SCA patients and the need for regular monitoring of the iron status of polytransfused SCA patients."

    "abstract": "We previously showed correction of sickle cell anemia (SCA) in mice utilizing a lentiviral vector (LV) expressing human γ-globin. Herein, we made a G16D mutation in the γ-globin gene to generate the G16D mutation (GbG<sup>M</sup>) LV to increase fetal hemoglobin formation. We also generated an insulated version of this LV, GbG<sup>MI</sup>, inserting a 36-bp insulator from the Foamy virus in the long terminal repeats of the LV. Preclinical batches of GbG<sup>M</sup> and GbG<sup>MI</sup> LV showed both were highly efficacious in correcting SCA in mice, with sustained gene transfer in primary transplanted SCA mice and high hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transduction in colony-forming unit-spleen in secondary transplanted mice. CRISPR-mediated targeting of the proviruses into the LMO2 proto-oncogene showed remarkably reduced LMO2 activation by both insulated and uninsulated LV, compared to the SFFV γ-RV vector targeted to the same locus. We therefore used the GbG<sup>M</sup> LV to perform preclinical human CD34<sup>+</sup> gene transfer. We assessed gene transfer and engraftment of human HSCs in two immunocompromised mouse models: persistent stable GbG<sup>M</sup>-transduced cell engraftment was comparable to that of untransduced cells with no detrimental effects on hematopoiesis up to 20 weeks post transplant. These robust preclinical studies in mouse and human HSCs allowed its translation into a clinical trial."

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a common inherited hemoglobinopathy associated with vaso-occlusive events that can mimic pulmonary embolism (PE), leading to the frequent use of computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA). However, trends in CTPA utilization over time remain unclear. This study aims to evaluate temporal trends and recurrent imaging patterns. A retrospective cohort study was conducted at Salmaniya Medical Complex, Bahrain, including SCD patients who underwent CTPA for suspected PE between April 15, 2013, and April 15, 2024. Descriptive statistics were used to report the frequency of recurrent scans, whereas linear regression analysis was employed to assess trends in CTPA utilization over the study period. The study included 1,084 patients (median age: 35 years, 55.7% male) with SCD who underwent a total of 1,934 CTPA scans. CTPA utilization remained stable from 2014 to 2020, averaging 10.0-13.6 scans per month. However, a significant surge was observed post-2020, coinciding with the COVID-19 pandemic, peaking in 2023, with an average of 31.3 scans per month, indicating a 2.9-fold increase (p = 0.03). During the study period, 415 patients (38.3%) underwent recurrent CTPA scans, with one-third (32.5%, n = 276) of these scans occurring within a 6-month interval. Although the PE positivity rate was lower in recurrent scans than in initial scans, the difference was not statistically significant (8.8% vs. 10.5%; p = 0.22). CTPA utilization among SCD patients remained stable for several years but increased significantly after 2020, coinciding with the COVID-19 pandemic. A substantial proportion of scans were recurrent, with many occurring within a short interval. Moving forward, efforts should focus on mitigating radiation exposure through low-dose protocols and investigating potential factors contributing to the recent increase in scan utilization."

    "abstract": "Thromboinflammation occurs in various diseases, leading to life-threatening microvascular occlusion with resulting end-organ failure<sup>1-4</sup>. Importantly, how microvascular thromboinflammation resolves remains poorly understood due to the small size-scale of microvasculature and the long duration (weeks to months) of this process. Here we introduce a hydrogel-based thromboinflammation-on-a-chip model with long-term culture capabilities to model microvascular thromboinflammation and monitor clot resolution over clinically and physiologically relevant timescales (up to months). Using this system, we mapped out the distinct temporal phases of clot resolution in microvascular thromboinflammation. Using multiplexed RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization in combination with our thromboinflammation-on-a-chip model, we observed that inflammation shifts the endothelium fibrinolytic balance to favour thrombosis and pinpointed neutrophil elastase as a double-edged sword that induces clot resolution but also tissue damage. We then investigated the mechanisms of potential therapeutic agents that either prevent microvascular thrombosis or accelerate clot resolution. Specifically, we observed that, in thromboinflammation, (1) early tissue plasminogen activator administration within 3 h directly improves endothelial barrier function; (2) prophylactic defibrotide and enoxaparin suppress microvascular thromboinflammation through endothelium-mediated mechanisms; and (3) combining enoxaparin with crizanlizumab reduces microvascular occlusion and protects endothelial function in sickle cell disease. These data introduce a paradigm in investigating the underlying mechanisms of thromboinflammatory clot resolution and conducting drug discovery thereof."

The different genotypes were distributed into three groups according to their mean residual HbA levels: <10 % (group 1; n = 22), between 10 and 20 % (group 2; n = 175) and > 20 % (group 3; n = 31). Routine red blood cells and hemoglobin parameters were compared between the three groups. Sixteen different sickle β<sup>+</sup>-thal genotypes were identified but only four of them were associated with a residual HbA level below 10 %. Patients of this group exhibited a more severe anemia (Hb < 10 g/dL; reticulocytes >200 G/L) compared to the two other groups. However, no difference could be observed on those parameters between patients of group 2 and 3, as well as for the main RBC parameters. According to our study, >80 % of the sickle β<sup>+</sup>-thalassemia patients in France have a residual HbA level beyond 10 % and a mild to moderate anemia. Only four β<sup>+</sup>-thal variations (all affecting the splicing process) would lead to a potentially severe SCD syndrome in association with HbS (HbA < 10 %) but this result should be confirmed in a prospective clinical study."

A cross-sectional analysis was conducted using data from the Fundação Oswaldo Cruz's platform, Plataforma de Ciência de Dados Aplicada à Saúde, encompassing hospitalizations related to SCD from January 2008 to December 2022. The International Classification of Diseases codes for SCD were used to retrieve data on incidence, mortality, procedures performed, and healthcare costs. The study included 151,535 hospitalizations for SCD, with 69.92% associated with SCD crises and 22.48% without crises. The mean annual hospitalizations were higher for crises (6,883.06) compared to those without crises (2,221.12). Mortality rates were significantly higher for patients hospitalized with crises compared to those without crises (p < 0.001). The economic impact of SCD was substantial, with annual costs exceeding 413 million USD. This study revealed a significant burden of SCD in Brazil, characterized by high hospitalization rates, particularly among younger patients, and elevated mortality rates associated with crises. Prospective studies and public health interventions are warranted to address SCD and mitigate its impact on public health."

Limited research has investigated the clinical and molecular risk factors for HHS, which could help identify at-risk patients. This study aimed to assess clinical factors associated with HHS and identify genetic variations that increase susceptibility using a candidate-gene approach. Data were obtained from the REDS-III SCD cohort, comprising 2793 patients who underwent whole-genome sequencing as part of the Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) program. Clinical and laboratory data were retrospectively collected. Patients with HHS were compared to matched controls (1:4) based on clinical variables and the frequency of single nucleotide variations (SNVs) associated with HHS, autoimmunity, and red blood cell (RBC) alloimmunization. HHS was identified in 13 patients (prevalence: 1.13%), the majority of whom had the HbSS genotype (69.2%). The most affected age group was 11-20 years (46.2%), and 61.5% of patients had RBC alloantibodies. Pain crisis was the most common indication for transfusion leading to HHS (41.7%). Three significant genetic variants were identified: rs10748663 (C > T) on chromosome 10 (BLNK gene), rs936469 (G > A) on chromosome 11 (PHRF1 gene), and rs6503691 (C > T) on chromosome 17 (STAT5B gene). HHS primarily affects adolescents and young adults with RBC alloantibodies, often following episodic transfusions. Genetic variations in STAT5B and the IRF7-PHRF1 region suggest that the B-cell receptor signaling pathway, which is essential for B-cell differentiation, may play a critical role in HHS pathophysiology."

The endpoints evaluated were feasibility, safety, and benefit (laboratory variables, sickle cell-related events, transfusions). <b>Results:</b> The patients assigned to hydroxyurea treatment had a lower annual rate of crises than the control group (median 2.9 vs. 5.3 crises per year, <i>p</i>=0.001), a lower annual rate of hospitalizations (median 2.2 vs. 4.7, <i>p</i>=0.002), and a lower annual rate of transfusions (median 1.3 vs. 5.1, <i>p</i>=0.001). We observed a significant increase in Hb F from 11.77% to 14.6% (<i>p</i>=0.001) in patients treated with hydroxyurea. We also observed a significant increase in the mean Hb level from 7.3 g/dL to 9.2 g/dL in patients treated with hydroxyurea (<i>p</i>=0.004). Patients treated with hydroxyurea also have a beneficial effect on WBC and platelet levels by reducing leukocytosis and thrombocytosis. The annual number of infectious complications was significantly lower in the group of patients treated with hydroxyurea. <b>Conclusion:</b> Hydroxyurea has an important clinical benefit by reducing the incidence of vaso-occlusive events, infections, and transfusions, which translates into fewer hospitalizations. The main problem is that it is not accessible to most of our patients who live in poor socioeconomic conditions."

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to synthesize evidence on disease-specific outcomes in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) or transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia (TDT) following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (allo-HSCT). A systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted in MEDLINE and Embase to identify publications up to May 2023, including patients with SCD or TDT treated with allo-HSCT. Occurrence of vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs) including acute pain, acute chest syndrome, priapism, and splenic sequestration in SCD, and red blood cell transfusion (RBCT) requirements in TDT were the main outcomes of interest. Transplant-related outcomes such as graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and graft failure/rejection were summarized in the studies that reported main outcomes. Proportion of patients experiencing VOCs or RBCTs, GVHD, and graft failure/rejection after allo-HSCT were aggregated and descriptively reported with range across studies. Thirty-one SCD studies met inclusion criteria. Twenty-nine studies assessed for VOC and pain crisis events after allo-HSCT; 11 studies reported ≥1 VOCs after allo-HSCT in 6.9% of the 2,760 patients. Graft failure was reported in 14.4% (0.9%-18.8%, 14 studies) of patients, graft rejection in 5.5% (1.6%-100.0%, 12 studies) of patients, acute GVHD in 22.4% (1.6%-50.0%, 19 studies) of patients, and chronic GVHD in 20.4% (3.3%-57.1%, 14 studies) of patients. Seventy-eight TDT studies met inclusion criteria. Fifty-six studies reported that 8.8% of the 3,107 patients required RBCTs after allo-HSCT. Graft failure was reported in 5.4% (1.1%-80.0%, 21 studies) of patients, graft rejection in 7.5% (0.5%-42.9%, 50 studies) of patients, acute GVHD in 28.4% (5.2%-100.0%, 57 studies) and chronic GVHD in 15.2% (1.3%-50.0%, 51 studies) of TDT patients. Based on this SLR, after allo-HSCT, a portion of patients with SCD continue to experience VOCs and a portion of patients with TDT continue to require RBCTs, in addition to experiencing GVHD and graft failure or rejection."

The transplantation of autologous, genetically modified hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) is a promising treatment option for patients with SCD. We completed a Phase I/II open-label clinical trial (NCT03964792) for patients with SCD using a lentiviral vector (DREPAGLOBE) expressing a potent anti-sickling β-globin. The primary endpoint was to evaluate the short-term safety and secondary endpoints included the efficacy and the long-term safety. We report on the results after 18 to 36 months of follow-up. No drug-related adverse events or signs of clonal hematopoiesis were observed. Despite similar vector copy numbers in the drug product, gene-marking in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and correction of the clinical phenotype varied from one patient to another. Single-cell transcriptome analyses show that in the patients with poor engraftment, the most immature HSCs display an exacerbated inflammatory signature (via IL-1 or TNF-α and interferon signaling pathways). This signature is accompanied by a lineage bias in the HSCs. Our clinical data indicates that the DREPAGLOBE-based gene therapy (GT) is safe. However, its efficacy is variable and probably depends on the number of infused HSCs and intrinsic, engraftment-impairing inflammatory alterations in HSCs. Trial: NCT03964792."

We evaluated the efficacy and safety of thalidomide plus hydroxyurea (HU) compared with HU alone to determine whether the combination provides a superior clinical benefit and safety profile. This was an open-label quasi-experimental clinical trial (Clinical Trials Registry of India, CTRI Registration Number 2023/04/065682). Patients with SCA aged > 12 years and postmenopausal females aged > 45 years were allocated 1:1 to receive either HU (20 mg/kg/day) and thalidomide (50 mg/day) in Group A or HU (20 mg/kg/day) only in Group B. The frequency of vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs), transfusion requirements, variations in hematological parameters (hemoglobin [Hb], fetal hemoglobin [HbF], and sickle hemoglobin [HbS]), and side effects between the groups were assessed over 12 months. Repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to determine changes across the observation period. The mean age of the 66 patients diagnosed with SCA (homozygous HbS mutation) was 32.9 (standard deviation ± 11.5) years, and 57.6% were males. Over the 12-month observation period, Group A had significantly fewer VOCs (3.48 ± 2.81) and packed red blood cell transfusions (3.61 ± 2.19) than Group B (11.36 ± 4.20 VOCs; 13.27 ± 3.70 transfusions) (p = 0.0001). There was a significant increase in Hb (8.2 ± 1.8 to 11.8 ± 1.2 g/dL), a decrease in HbS% (72.5 ± 5.5 to 64.5 ± 5.4), and a rise in HbF% (18.9 ± 5.1 to 28.4 ± 5.6) (p < 0.0001) in Group A.

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD), an inherited blood disorder caused by a mutation in the β-globin gene, is characterized by sickle erythrocytes that are prone to hemolysis, causing anemia and vaso-occlusion crises. In sickle erythrocytes, hemoglobin aggregation is followed by altered cation permeability and subsequent dehydration. Interventions to restore cation permeability can decrease hemolysis and ameliorate the symptoms associated with SCD. PIEZO1 is a non-selective mechanosensitive cation channel that regulates erythrocyte volume. Gain-of-function (GOF) mutations in PIEZO1 cause hemolytic anemia by increasing cation permeability, leading to erythrocyte dehydration in humans and mice. Although PIEZO1 plays a key role in erythrocyte homeostasis, its role in SCD remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the function of the PIEZO1 channel is upregulated in sickle erythrocytes of humans and mice, and this enhancement can be restored through a dietary intervention. We found that PIEZO1 function in sickle erythrocytes resembles that of the GOF mutation causing hemolytic anemia. A diet enriched in the <i>ω</i> -3 fatty acid eicosapentaenoic (EPA) acid decreases PIEZO1 function in sickle erythrocytes and hemolysis in a mouse model of SCD. Furthermore, EPA decreases hemolysis and reduces inflammatory markers. We propose that PIEZO1 contributes to the increase in nonselective cationic conductance (i.e., Psickle), which leads to dehydration downstream of hemoglobin polymerization. Our results suggest that reducing PIEZO1 function is a promising therapeutic approach to reestablishing normal cation permeability in SCD."

A successful transition is critical for optimal health outcomes. However, health care delivery systems that support the optimal transfer from pediatric to adult care have not kept pace with the growing adult population. Mulago pediatric sickle cell clinic has faced multiple challenges with transition to adult care that are not well documented. The objective of this study was to describe the clinical characteristics of adolescents and adults with sickle cell disease and barriers to adult care at Mulago hospital. This was a mixed methods cross sectional study with both qualitative and quantitative data collection methods conducted among patients attending the pediatric sickle cell clinic at Mulago hospital, their caregivers and health care workers. A registry and medical records review was done to obtain data for the quantitative arm. The qualitative component consisted of 30 in-depth-interviews involving patients and care givers and 10 key informant interviews with healthcare workers. Quantitative data was coded and entered into Epidata version 4.6 and then exported to STATA 14 for analysis. Qualitative data was analyzed using the content thematic approach. The proportion of patients aged 14 years and above still attending the pediatric clinic was 21.6%. Barriers to transition of care as expressed by care givers and patients were limited knowledge on transition, attachment to their pediatric careers and negative experiences in the adult clinics. Health care system barriers included poorly organized adult clinics with few working days compared to the paediatric clinic that operates daily. This was compounded by lack of policies and guidelines on transition, inadequate human resource and limited access to the essential drugs in the adult clinics. There is still a large proportion of adults and young adults (AYAs) still attending the pediatric sickle cell clinic and barriers to transition were not only sociodemographic but also psychosocial and health system related. There is need for better planning and preparation with better patient centered interventions in order to improve transition."

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) includes a range of genotypes that result in a clinical syndrome, where abnormal red blood cell (RBC) physiology leads to widespread complications affecting nearly every organ system. Treatment strategies for SCD can be broadly categorized into disease-modifying therapies and those aimed toward a cure. Although several disease-modifying drugs have been approved, they do not fully address the complexity and severity of SCD. Recent advances in allogeneic transplantation and autologous gene therapy show promising outcomes in terms of efficacy and safety. While these approaches have improved the lives of many patients, achieving a durable and comprehensive cure for all remains challenging. To address this, gene-editing technologies, including zinc-finger nucleases, TALENs, CRISPR-Cas, base editing, and prime editing, have been explored both ex vivo and in vivo for targeted correction of the β-globin gene (HBB) in SCD. However, direct correction of HBB and its translation from the laboratory to the clinic presents ongoing limitations, with challenges involved in achieving robust mutation-correction efficiency, off-target effects, and high costs of therapies. The optimal strategy for curing SCD remains uncertain, but several promising approaches are emerging. This review touches on past, present, and future developments in HBB correction."

Through a unique collaboration between researchers and filmmakers, we conducted an online survey experiment with a nationally representative U.S. quota sample, including an oversample of Black respondents (N = 1637). We found that Black female scientists face challenges in being perceived as warm and competent compared to their peers. Our findings revealed significant intersectional biases: Black female scientists received the lowest ratings in both warmth and competence, with ratings dropping further when introducing a story about a White patient. Black male scientists received consistently high ratings across experimental conditions, particularly showing elevated warmth scores when discussing a Black protagonist with sickle cell anemia. They also maintained high competence ratings whether working with Black or White protagonists. This pattern suggests that while Black scientists generally faced discrimination, Black men's gender afforded them certain privileges that were not extended to Black women in scientific fields. Our findings highlight persistent, intersectional biases and emphasize the need for comprehensive approaches to diversity and inclusion in scientific communication, which includes addressing the prejudices faced by female scientists and scientists of color."

    "abstract": "In diseases from diabetes to malaria, blood dynamics are significantly altered, resulting in poor clinical outcomes. However, the multiscale mechanisms that determine blood flow in the microcirculation in health and disease are undefined, largely owing to the difficulty in directly linking cell properties to whole-blood rheology. Here, we overcome these difficulties by developing a microfluidic platform to measure red blood cell properties and flow dynamics in the same blood samples from donors. We focus on sickle cell disease (SCD), a genetic disorder that causes red blood cells to stiffen in deoxygenated conditions, with disease pathology driven by oxygen-dependent blood rheology. Our linked cell and whole-blood measurements establish that increases in effective resistances in heterogeneous suspensions are driven by increases in the proportion of stiff cells, similar macroscopically to the behavior of rigid-particle suspensions. Furthermore, by combining simulations with spatially resolved measurements of cell dynamics, we show how the spatio-temporal organization of stiff and deformable cells determines blood rheology and drives disease pathophysiology. In the presence of deformable cells, the stiffened cells marginate towards channel walls, increasing effective wall friction. In fully deoxygenated conditions in which all cells are stiffened, significant heterogeneity in cell volume fraction along the direction of flow causes localized jamming, drastically increasing effective viscous flow resistance. Our work defines the relevant suspension physics required to understand pathological blood rheology in SCD and other diseases affecting red blood cell properties. More broadly, we reveal the multiscale processes that determine emergent rheology in heterogeneous particle suspensions."

    "title": "Advancing CRISPR genome editing into gene therapy clinical trials: progress and future prospects.",
    "abstract": "Genome editing has recently evolved from a theoretical concept to a powerful and versatile set of tools. The discovery and implementation of CRISPR-Cas9 technology have propelled the field further into a new era. This RNA-guided system allows for specific modification of target genes, offering high accuracy and efficiency. Encouraging results are being announced in clinical trials employed in conditions like sickle cell disease (SCD) and transfusion-dependent beta-thalassaemia (TDT). The path finally led the way to the recent FDA approval of the first gene therapy drug utilising the CRISPR/Cas9 system to edit autologous CD34+ haematopoietic stem cells in SCD patients (Casgevy). Ongoing research explores the potential of CRISPR technology for cancer therapies, HIV treatment and other complex diseases. Despite its remarkable potential, CRISPR technology faces challenges such as off-target effects, suboptimal delivery systems, long-term safety concerns, scalability, ethical dilemmas and potential repercussions of genetic alterations, particularly in the case of germline editing. Here, we examine the transformative role of CRISPR technologies, including base editing and prime editing approaches, in modifying the genetic and epigenetic codes in the human genome and provide a comprehensive focus, particularly on relevant clinical applications, to unlock the full potential and challenges of gene editing."

    "title": "Hemodynamic profile of cerebral arteries using transcranial Doppler in children with sickle cell disease compared to children without sickle cell disease: Prospective analytical study.",
    "abstract": "Cerebral vasculopathy is a frequent and serious complication of major sickle cell disease syndromes. Transcerebral Doppler (TCD) can detect stenosis of the main arteries at the base of the skull before stroke occurs, and initiate therapy to avoid complications. The objective of the study is to evaluate and compare the hemodynamic profile of the middle cerebral artery using TCD in children with sickle cell disease compared to children without sickle cell disease. Prospective analytical study extended over a 6-month period from July 04, 2023 to December 28, 2023. The study population consisted of subjects followed for homozygous sickle cell disease SS and non-sickle cell subjects received at the above-mentioned centers, of all sexes, aged 2 to 16 years at most. We recruited 182 children (52.2% male and 47.8% female) divided into 70 children with sickle cell disease and 112 children without sickle cell disease. The mean of Maximum systolic velocity (MSV) on the left was 85.0 ± 49.5 cm/s in sickle cell patients and 84.5 ± 17.8 cm/s in non-sickle cell patients. The mean of telediastolic velocity (TDV) was 40.9 ± 31.2 cm/s in sickle cell patients and 44.0 ± 15.8 cm/s in non-sickle cell patients. The mean maximum velocity (MMV) was 53.22 ± 39.0 cm/s in sickle cell patients and 57.5 ± 16.3 cm/s in non-sickle cell patients. The mean velocity of children with sickle cell disease was lower than that of non-sickle cell patients, and the peak systolic velocity of children with sickle cell disease was slightly higher than those of children without sickle cell disease."

    "abstract": "Fibroblast Growth Factor 23 (FGF23) is increased in serum of humanized Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) mice. Since FGF23 is associated with impaired bone formation, we examined the effect of FGF23-neutralizing antibody (FGF23Ab) on bone loss in SCD mice. Healthy control (Ctrl) and SCD 5-months-old female mice were treated with FGF23Ab or isotype-specific IgG for 6 weeks. Significantly reduced hematocrit in SCD mice was increased by FGF23Ab. MicroCT of SCD femurs revealed no significant reduction in metaphyseal bone volume/total volume vs. Ctrl mice. However, histomorphometry of SCD femur revealed significantly reduced mineral apposition rate, bone formation rate, inter-label thickness, and osteoid surface, which were increased by FGF23Ab. Significantly increased osteoclast number/bone perimeter in SCD mice was reduced by FGF23Ab. Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC) cultured in osteogenic media revealed significantly reduced mineralized nodules in SCD-IgG-BMSC that was increased in SCD-FGF23Ab-BMSC. FGF23 and αKlotho protein was significantly increased in SCD-IgG-BMSC and was not reduced by FGF23Ab. However, phosphorylated FGF Receptor-1, the receptor through which FGF23 signals, was significantly reduced by FGF23Ab. The mineralization inhibitor osteopontin was significantly increased in SCD-IgG-BMSC cultures and was reduced by FGF23Ab. We conclude that FGF23Ab may be efficacious in improving some parameters of reduced bone formation in female SCD mice."

    "abstract": "It is unclear if adolescents with sickle cell disease (SCD) are screened for depression, since primary care provider (PCP) visits decline with age and socioeconomic disadvantage may impact receipt of care. This 1-year study identified 97% of adolescents with SCD at Nationwide Children's Hospital (NCH) had a PCP. Among those with an NCH PCP (n = 55), 40% saw their PCP and 33% were screened for depression. Socioeconomic disadvantage was not associated with receipt of depression screening (p = 0.55) or PCP care (p = 0.22). While adolescents with SCD often have PCPs, interventions to increase PCP engagement may improve depression identification in this high-risk population."

Disparities exist in terms of underserved and underrepresented groups, including children, young people and minority ethnic groups. This study sought to listen, hear and understand what is important for children and young people with sickle cell disorder and their families in terms of research involvement and co-produce resource(s) to enable inclusive and equitable research involvement. A sequential qualitative study consisting of three work packages to (i) identify structures and processes, (ii) identify resources and (iii) co-produce an animation to enable equitable and inclusive research involvement for children and young people with sickle cell disorder and their families. Children and young people with sickle cell disorder, their parents and researchers highlighted several important considerations to ensure inclusive and equitable research involvement, including practical elements, the age and stage of development of the child, as well as condition-specific issues such as stigma. The use of a variety of approaches and techniques is vital to support inclusive, equitable and sustained involvement and engagement in research activities. There are many potential barriers that need to be overcome to involve children and young people with sickle cell disorder and their families in research. These include the need for flexible timings of activities, clear expectation setting, consideration of group dynamics and the impact of different ages and stages of development of the children and young people involved, and ensuring appropriate recognition and compensation for their time. Listening, hearing and understanding what is important to children and young people with long-term conditions and using a variety of approaches is vital to support inclusive, equitable and sustained involvement and engagement in research. Patients (children and young people with sickle cell disorder), caregivers and people with lived experience were involved in conducting the study, analysis and interpretation of the data and preparation of the manuscript.

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a prevalent hereditary disorder with significant morbidity, including potential impacts on male fertility. This study aims to evaluate the semen parameters in men with SCD and assess the outcomes of fertility preservation strategies. This retrospective study included 121 men with SCD referred to the fertility Centre at Tenon University Hospital, Paris, between 2012 and 2023. Patients were categorized into three groups based on hydroxyurea (HU) exposure: without HU (WHU), ongoing HU(OHU), and previous HU (PHU). Clinical and semen parameters data were collected and compared with those of 107 healthy sperm donors. Semen parameters were analyzed according to World Health Organization guidelines, and sperm freezing protocols were standardized. Statistical analysis was performed to compare semen parameters between groups. Of the 121 patients, 117 successfully collected semen. All semen parameters, including volume, concentration, total count, motility, vitality, and morphology, were significantly reduced in SCD patients without HU exposure compared to donors. Nine had azoospermia and 45 had oligozoospermia, compared to 11 sperm donors with oligozoospermia (p < 0.05). The impact of HU on semen parameters could not be demonstrated due to the small-sample size. Fertility preservation outcomes showed a mean of 1.96 collections per patient, yielding a mean of 8.7 straws, with a majority requiring in vitro fertilization with intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) for future use. Seven patients used their cryopreserved sperm, resulting in two successful births. This study, the largest of its kind, confirms significant alterations in semen parameters in men with SCD. Due to deleterious effects of treatments on male reproductive functions, fertility preservation remains crucial for these patients. Further research is needed to refine fertility preservation strategies and address the long-term reproductive health of men with SCD."

    "abstract": "In 2019, AABB released the bulletin \"Recommendations on the Use of Group O Red Blood Cells\" in which the recommendations about pediatric and neonatal blood transfusions were limited. Eight U.S. pediatric hospitals sought to determine trends in pediatric group O blood use and clarify which pediatric populations receive group O blood transfusions despite a non-group O blood type. Eight U.S.-based institutions serving a pediatric population provided data from their respective Electronic Health Records. Data submitted included unit blood type, patient blood type, patient age, sex, and discharge diagnosis. If the discharge diagnosis was not available, the admitting diagnosis was substituted. GPT-4 was used to sort diagnoses into categories for analysis. Data were visualized using a series of alluvial plots, spaghetti plots, and tables. Tables were stratified on variables of interest (blood type, age, sex, diagnosis) to explore O blood type distribution among different patient populations. A total of 142,227 discrete transfusion events were identified, of which 52,731 recipients were non-O blood type. Overall, 35,575 transfusion events of O blood went to A, B, or AB blood type recipients (67%). Additionally, 26% of Rh(D) negative transfusion events went to recipients who were Rh(D) positive. Top diagnostic categories for receiving O blood type were cardiovascular disorders (22%) and sickle cell anemia (15%). This study highlights opportunities to address O blood supply challenges by identifying where non-O blood may be utilized safely in the vulnerable pediatric population."

Therefore, early detection is a crucial aspect of managing SCD to mitigate complications and improve health outcomes for SCD children. Neonatal screening is the primary method for identifying newborns with SCD, enabling early diagnosis, family screening, and comprehensive medical care. The protocol presented in this paper describes a study aimed at screening newborns for SCD in high-prevalence SCD states of India to understand the magnitude of the problem and the benefits of early comprehensive care along with the genotypic and phenotypic correlation. <b>Methods:</b> A prospective cohort study will be conducted across seven sites in six states of India (Rajasthan, Odisha, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, and Gujarat), having a high prevalence of SCD. The cord blood or heel prick samples of all the live-born babies delivered within the facilities of selected regions will be collected for screening SCD by HPLC (High-Performance Liquid Chromatography). All the sickle cell homozygous (SS) babies will be confirmed at 6 weeks for Sickle genotype along with cascade screening. Further, SS babies will be followed up from six weeks up to five years of life with initiation of folic acid, antibiotic prophylaxis, and hydroxyurea treatment at appropriate times. <b>Results:</b> The protocol aims to lay the groundwork for the smooth implementation of newborn screening programs and effective follow-up strategies. <b>Conclusions:</b> It will pave the way for developing a strategic framework for implementing newborn screening programs for haemoglobinopathies in India."

The event brought together a diverse group of experts, including international regulatory bodies, regulated industries, healthcare professionals, patients, academic researchers and global health advocates, to discuss the rapid advancements in gene therapy and the pressing need for equitable access in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs), with sickle cell disease (SCD) serving as the model disorder for the discussions. Although there has been significant progress in gene therapy, such as breakthroughs in clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-based technologies and FDA-approved therapies, access to these therapies remain limited in underresourced regions. The workshop addressed critical challenges, including the high cost of therapies, regulatory gaps and barriers and ethical concerns regarding informed consent and public engagement in LMICs. This paper highlights the critical discussion points from the workshop with a focus on exploring strategies for global regulatory convergence, the role of international collaborations and the potential pathways to making gene therapies affordable and accessible to all."

    "abstract": "Globally, sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most common inherited haemoglobinopathy. The highest burden of SCD is encountered in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), most of which lack the resources to contend with the disease. There is a marked divide between care for individuals with SCD in high-income countries (HICs) versus LMICs, whereby the few disease-modifying therapies and curative regimens are only accessible to those in HICs. As such, blood transfusion remains central to the emergent treatment and prevention of complications of SCD. However, there are a myriad of related challenges in LMICs, which have impeded efforts to treat patients with SCD effectively. In addition to blood safety and availability, examples that impact SCD specifically include capabilities to detect and/or manage red blood cell alloimmunization, capacity for automated red cell exchange, limited immunohematology, suboptimal quality oversight with a lack of safeguards to prevent transfusion of incompatible blood and limited or absent post-transfusion surveillance to detect and/or manage transfusion-associated adverse events. Consequently, clinical practices that are otherwise regarded as standard of care in HICs remain the exception in LMICs, highlighting disparities in care. A multifaceted approach that prioritizes transfusion support in LMICs is needed to improve care for patients with SCD."

Eliminating these acute pain events is a key outcome in SCD clinical trials; however, the definition of a vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) or a vaso-occlusive event (VOE) has not been consistently applied, hampering comparisons of treatment efficacy between different therapeutic approaches. We have examined the degree to which differing definitions of vaso-occlusion in clinical trial endpoints impact efficacy outcomes. Descriptions of clinical endpoints related to vaso-occlusion and pain events were reviewed from trials of exagamglogene autotemcel (exa-cel), lovotibeglogene autotemcel (lovo-cel), renizgamglogene autogedtemcel (reni-cel), hydroxyurea, L-glutamine, voxelotor, and crizanlizumab. Patient-level data from the published exa-cel Phase 3 pivotal trial (CLIMB SCD-121; data cut 14 Jun 2023) was used to evaluate efficacy outcomes based on differing endpoint definitions of vaso-occlusion. In the seven clinical trials reviewed, definitions of vaso-occlusion and/or pain events varied by care setting, duration of care, treatments used, and associated complications, with the frequency and duration of medical facility visits for acute pain events being most dissimilar between trials. Definitions of severe VOCs (exa-cel), VOC (voxelotor), and sickle cell-related pain crises (SCPCs; crizanlizumab and L-glutamine) included pain events requiring a medical facility visit of any duration, whereas the definition of painful crises (hydroxyurea) required a medical facility visit of > 4 h and the definition of severe vaso-occlusive events (VOEs; lovo-cel and reni-cel) required a hospital or emergency room (ER) observation unit visit lasting ≥ 24 h or ≥ 2 visits to a day unit or ER over a 72-h period. Based on the definition of severe VOCs, 29/30 patients [96.7%; 95% confidence interval (CI): 82.8, 99.9] in the CLIMB SCD-121 trial were considered free from severe VOCs for ≥ 12 consecutive months, whereas when the severe VOEs definition was applied to the same data, all patients (30/30; 100.0%; 95% CI: 88.4, 100.0) were considered free from severe VOEs for ≥ 12 consecutive months. Differences exist in definitions of vaso-occlusion and pain events used in SCD clinical trials. Severe VOCs (exa-cel), VOC (voxelotor), and SCPCs (crizanlizumab and L-glutamine) were more broadly inclusive than severe VOEs (lovo-cel and reni-cel) or painful crisis (hydroxyurea). Clinically, these differences resulted in differing numbers of patients being considered free from vaso-occlusion pain events, underscoring the challenge in comparing frequencies of pain events across SCD clinical trials."

    "abstract": "Renal hemosiderosis, marked by the buildup of hemosiderin in the renal cortex due to chronic intravascular hemolysis, can lead to acute kidney injury. Iron deposited may exacerbate renal damage through processes like lipid peroxidation and free radical formation, impacting cellular function and precipitating renal disease. Although seen commonly with chronic intravascular hemolysis in the setting of sickle cell anemia, thalassemia, and in the setting of prosthetic cardiac valves. While acute renal failure following prosthetic cardiac valve placement is relatively uncommon, some cases of renal injury in the setting of mechanical hemolysis have been reported, in the postsurgical period, typically within 2 weeks. In this case report, we present a 67-year-old male patient, following mitral valve repair, who developed anemia within 2 weeks of the repair. Evaluation with echocardiography did not initially show findings of worsening mitral regurgitation, however, his anemia and kidney function worsened over the next 6 months. Further evaluation, during that time showed worsening mitral valve regurgitation in repeated echocardiography, with renal hemosiderosis confirmed via kidney biopsy, revealing glomerulosclerosis with hemosiderin deposits. Due to persisting anemia and worsening kidney function, the patient is being planned for a mitral valve replacement. The potential recovery of renal function remains uncertain. Despite the common occurrence of intravascular hemolysis following prosthetic valve placement or valve repair, only a few cases of acute renal failure have been reported. In these cases, severe hemolytic anemia developed shortly after surgery, within 2 weeks, with increased levels of creatinine, even reported as high as 8.2 mg/dL and renal biopsy revealed acute tubular injury and widespread tubular hemosiderosis, resembling the findings in the index case. Diagnosis depends on the evaluation of anemia, showing signs of hemolysis, with echocardiology findings of worsening valvular abnormalities, and kidney biopsy findings showing hemosiderin deposits. Treatment strategies encompass the management of anemia alongside considerations for either mitral valve replacement or repair. This case underscores the importance of considering the possibility of renal hemosiderosis, associated with mitral valve repair. The delay in diagnosis observed in this case is not uncommon, and timely recognition becomes pertinent to prevent irreversible renal injury and improve long-term outcomes."

    "abstract": "Hyperhemolysis syndrome (HS) is a rare but severe transfusion-associated complication seen in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). The management of HS includes avoidance of post-hyperhemolysis red blood cell (RBC) transfusion to avoid reoccurrence of HS (recurrent HS). However, complete avoidance of post-hyperhemolysis RBC transfusion (PHRT) is sometimes not clinically possible, and the standard of care for recurrent HS prophylaxis for patients requiring PHRT has not been established. We present a retrospective case series of four pediatric patients with SCD and a history of HS requiring PHRT, and describe their HS prophylaxis and outcomes. All patients received HS prophylaxis before transfusion, and three patients received an additional prophylactic regimen post-transfusion. Three patients were transfused with extended phenotype-matched RBCs, while one patient received only Rh (D, C/c, E/e) and K antigens matched RBCs. Only one patient did not develop recurrent HS after PHRT. Three patients had documented hemolysis, and two patients met our criteria for recurrent HS, all requiring escalation of care. Even though the patients were treated in the same institution, there was variability in the choice of HS prophylaxis therapy and selection of RBCs, which can be attributed to the lack of guidance on PHRT management. We observed a lack of conclusive evidence in the effectiveness of prophylactic combination immunosuppressive therapy. Our observations suggest caution must be taken when transfusing patients with SCD and a history of HS, as there are no definitive therapies to effectively mitigate the risk of recurrent HS."

Although there is a belief that adverse perinatal outcomes are frequent in pregnant women with SCA, this association has not been clearly established. The aim of this study was to compare the perinatal outcomes of women with homozygous mutated SCA who gave birth with those without the mutation. <b>Methods</b>: The study included 26 SCA patients with homozygous mutation and 108 pregnant women without mutation who gave birth in our center. Demographic and obstetric data, laboratory findings, and fetal findings of both groups were compared. <b>Results:</b> Statistically significant differences were found between the groups in terms of maternal age, body mass index (BMI), gravida, and parity (<i>p</i> ≤ 0.001, <i>p</i> = 0.035, <i>p</i> ≤ 0.001, <i>p</i> ≤ 0.001, respectively). Mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), red blood cell count (RBC), hemoglobin (Hb), and hematocrit (Hct) values were significantly lower in the SCA group. We also observed that more blood transfusions were performed during pregnancy and the postpartum period in the SCA group. Low birth weight, more neonatal intensive care unit admissions, and a higher cesarean section rate were present in the SCA group. During pregnancy, women with SCA were most frequently admitted to the hospital for acute painful crises. Preeclampsia was not more common in the SCA group. <b>Conclusions:</b> SCA carries serious risks for the mother and fetus during pregnancy. Therefore, the relationship between the disease and pregnancy requires more detailed research."

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a severe inherited blood disorder characterized by abnormal hemoglobin (HbS) that leads to varying degrees of severity, including chronic hemolysis, episodic vaso-occlusion, and damage to multiple organs, causing significant morbidity and mortality. While SCD is a monogenic disease, its complications are influenced by polygenic factors. SCD prevalence is notably high in regions including the Middle East, with Saudi Arabia reporting significant cases, particularly in the Eastern Province. Most genetic factors associated with SCD outcomes have been identified in populations predominantly from Africa or of African ancestry. This study aims to identify genetic variants that characterize Saudi SCD patients with the potential to influence disease outcomes in this population. A multicenter case-control genome-wide association study (GWAS) was conducted involving 350 adult Saudi SCD patients and 202 healthy controls. Participants were genotyped using the Affymetrix Axiom array, covering 683,030 markers. Rigorous quality control measures were applied to ensure data integrity. Fisher's exact was used to identify genetic variants with a significant difference in allele frequency (<i>p</i> < 5 × 10<sup>-8</sup>). Functional annotations and regulatory functions of variants were determined using the Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) and RegulomeDB databases. The GWAS identified numerous significant genetic variants characterizing SCD cases in the Saudi population. These variants, distributed across multiple chromosomes, were found in genes with known functional consequences. A substantial proportion of the markers were detected in the olfactory receptor cluster, <i>TRIM</i> family, and <i>HBB</i> locus genes. Many of the identified genes were reported in previous studies showing significant associations with various SCD outcomes, including hemoglobin regulation, inflammation, immune response, and vascular function. The findings highlight the genetic complexity underlying SCD and its clinical manifestations. The identified variants suggest potential molecular biomarkers and therapeutic targets, enhancing our understanding of the molecular basis of SCD in the Saudi population. This is the first genetic analysis characterizing SCD patients compared to healthy individuals, uncovering genetic markers that could serve as diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Given the known molecular mechanisms of the detected genetic loci, these provide a foundation for precision medicine in SCD management, highlighting the need for further studies to validate these results and explore their clinical implications."

    "abstract": "Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) require lifelong adherence to treatment protocols, significantly affecting their care quality. Despite effective disease-modifying drug therapies (DMDTs), adherence remains suboptimal, with 30%-60% of patients being nonadherent. Ensuring medication adherence is crucial to attain the intended outcomes of DMDTs in patients with SCD. This article examines the concept of \"medication adherence\" in adult patients with SCD undergoing DMDTs, offering fresh insights, knowledge, and clarity regarding the concept. Walker and Avant's methods for concept analysis were employed to establish attributes, antecedents, consequences, and empirical referents of adherence in adult patients with SCD on DMDTs. A thorough literature search of PubMed, Cochrane Library, and CINAHL was conducted, encompassing peer-reviewed articles published in English from 2009 to 2023, using keywords and Boolean operators pertinent to adherence and SCD. Following the literature search, 55 articles were identified, with 29 excluded based on title and abstract. The eligibility process narrowed the count to 15 pertinent articles included in this concept analysis. Attributes, antecedents, and consequences were synthesized to formulate a definition well-founded in the literature. Adherence is crucial in health care and offers an opportunity for interventions to improve patient outcomes. Understanding adherence to treatment protocols is vital for health care providers and researchers, and it should be further integrated into research and practice to improve the quality of life for patients with SCD. Integrating SCD medication adherence into nursing education and continuing education has the potential to enhance clinical interventions, improve patient outcomes, and refine nursing practice."

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a group of inherited disorders caused by a mutation in the beta globin gene that leads to sickling of red blood cells and results in anemia and Vaso-occlusive crises (VOC). VOC are described as an acute worsening of symptoms impacting daily life and often requiring treatment to resolve. A majority of SCD interventional trial endpoints consider VOC that require attendance at a health facility and do not account for VOC managed at home. These studies report lower VOC incidence compared to those that consider VOC managed both in the healthcare setting and at home. This presents challenges to the consistent and accurate assessment of treatment effect in reducing overall VOC count. This paper outlines a USA consensus exercise conducted with patients and a scientific expert review committee to develop a patient-centric VOC model that may apply across incidences, individuals, and treatment settings. The model is supported by a monitoring biomarker specification for the objective identification and classification of VOC taking place in the healthcare setting and at home. We additionally propose hardware, software, diaries, and patient-reported outcomes for an initial instrument design to evaluate the potential of the model in a validation study."

While infection with non-typhoidal (NTS) serovars often results in self-limited enterocolitis in high-income settings, in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) where these risk-comorbidities are common, an invasive (iNTS) disease phenotype is seen, associated with up to 20 % case-fatality ratio, and antimicrobial resistance is both significant and growing. The need to evaluate the potential public health value of vaccines against iNTS disease is increasingly being recognized, and several candidate vaccines are in early development. A better understanding of the global burden and epidemiology of iNTS disease, as well as the potential public health and socio-economic benefits that iNTS vaccines may offer is fundamental to support and justify the investments in vaccine development. In addition, the pathways for licensure, policy recommendations and eventual vaccine prioritization and use in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) need to be defined. Here, we report on the proceedings of an expert consultation held on 29 November - 1 December 2021 as part of an overall project to develop a Full Value of Vaccines Assessment (FVVA) for iNTS vaccines and in addition to more recent iNTS vaccine developments. Experts at the consultation reviewed the current evidence on iNTS disease and discussed knowledge gaps to be addressed to accelerate vaccine development, licensure and introduction, as well as LMIC perspectives on potential iNTS vaccine use and demand. The learnings from this consultation are critical inputs to inform remaining work under the iNTS FVVA project."

    "abstract": "To identify factors associated with the occurrence of leg ulcers in people with sickle cell disease. Unpaired case-control study, conducted in 11 specialized services, between August 2019 and April 2020. The convenience sample consisted of 262 people over 18 years of age, diagnosed with sickle cell disease, with 190 controls and 72 cases. To evaluate the possible factors associated with the occurrence of ulcers, both univariate and multivariate binary logistic regression models were used. The factors associated with the occurrence of leg ulcers were previously healed ulcers (odds ratio 48.48), presence of edema in the lower limbs (5.75), use of antibiotics in the last six months (3.08), daily rest (4.59), and use of compression stockings (6.24). Overweight (0.16), physical leisure (0.33), and domestic (0.37) activities were associated with a lower chance of occurrence of ulcers. Identifying the factors that increase the likelihood of leg ulcers occurring in people with sickle cell disease adds to our knowledge of the subject, especially by determining factors that mitigate the occurrence of ulcers and that go beyond clinical variables."

    "abstract": "Vaso-occlusive events (VOEs) are the primary cause of acute pain in individuals with sickle cell disease (SCD), where high-dose opioids are the current standard treatment. Ketamine, a non-opioid analgesic, holds potential for managing acute SCD due to its opioid-sparing properties. This study aimed to explore the barriers and facilitators to an inpatient clinical trial of ketamine infusion for treatment of acute SCD pain. A mixed-methods design integrated quantitative survey data from 70 sickle cell and emergency medicine clinicians with qualitative insights from 10 patient focus group participants. Survey responses (n = 77 total, including seven registered nurses) were analyzed descriptively and via Fisher's exact and Mann-Whitney <i>U</i>-tests, while focus groups were thematically coded using themes from the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research. Clinicians showed varied comfort levels with ketamine, with significant differences between sickle cell and emergency medicine clinicians. Barriers to future trials included the lack of standardized protocols (50.6%) and providers' attitudes regarding ketamine (32.5%). Patients cited trust in providers and potential health benefits as key facilitators but also expressed concerns about safety, confidentiality, and time commitment of trial participation. Successful implementation of inpatient trials of pain interventions, such as ketamine infusions, requires a multidisciplinary approach, transparent communication about risks, strong clinical frameworks, and patient-centered trial designs. While study limitations, such as potential selection bias and low survey response rate, should be considered, these findings provide actionable insights to guide the design of future clinical trials and improve non-opioid pain management for SCD."

    "abstract": "Advances in conditioning regimens have made non-myeloablative allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) a viable curative option for adults with sickle cell disease (SCD). However, prospective studies comparing pre- and post-transplant patient-reported health outcomes are scarce. Therefore, in a prospective, mixed-methods cohort study in adults with SCD undergoing HSCT, we tested the hypothesis that physical, mental, and social health improves after HSCT relative to baseline. We compared 9 Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS®) measures at 6, 12, and 18 months post-transplant to baseline and general population values. Semi-structured interviews were conducted pre- and post-transplant that were thematically analyzed (MAXQDA). Seventeen patients (7 females, 10 males; median age 26 years) underwent matched sibling (9) or haploidentical donor (8) transplantation. Compared to baseline, pain interference (<i>p</i> = 0.008), physical function (<i>p</i> < 0.001), fatigue (<i>p</i> = 0.001), anxiety (<i>p</i> = 0.016), anger (<i>p</i> = 0.037), and the ability to (<i>p</i> < 0.001) and satisfaction with (<i>p</i> < 0.001) social roles and activities improved at 18 months. Compared to reference values, physical function, sleep disturbance, fatigue, anxiety, and the ability to and satisfaction with social roles and activities <i>T</i>-scores were significantly worse at baseline but comparable or better after 18 months. Thematic analysis of the interviews revealed high satisfaction with improved physical and social abilities alongside complex mental health challenges, including processing the psychological aftermath of SCD, dealing with transplant-related toxicity, adjustment challenges, and identity conflicts. In conclusion, while physical, mental, and social health improves after HSCT, the effects on mental health can be complex and warrant psychosocial support early in the process of curative therapies."

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease is a hereditary disorder in which the pathophysiology is driven by the aggregation of a mutant (sickle) hemoglobin (HbS). The self-assembly of deoxygenated sickle hemoglobin molecules into ordered fiber structures has consequences extending to the cellular and rheological levels, stiffening red blood cells and inducing pathological flow behavior. This review explores the current understanding of the molecular processes involved in the polymerization of hemoglobin in sickle cell disease and how the molecular phase transition creates quantifiable changes at the cellular and rheological scale, as well as, identifying knowledge gaps in the field that would improve our understanding of the disease and further improve treatment and management of the disease."

    "abstract": "Readiness for discharge for a SCD vaso-occlusive crisis is dictated by factors far beyond pain control, including physical function/activity. We therefore designed and tested a functional status-based pain assessment questionnaire in SCD patients hospitalized with vaso-occlusive crises. Sickle cell disease patients on a preselected nursing unit rated 10 draft Functional status-Based Pain Assessment items of activities of daily living on a five-point Likert scale (0-5) from \"very easy\" to \"very difficult\" daily on each day of their admission until discharge, at approximately the same time. Concurrently, they reported Numeric Rating Scale (0-10) pain intensity. For validation, we used exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, and item response theory analysis. We analyzed 503 observations from 175 admissions of 88 patients. Half were female, the mean age was 32.1 ± 11.8 years, and the mean length of stay was 7.1 ± 6.9 days. The mean Numeric Rating Scale (6.8 ± 1.9) was inversely correlated with the mean Functional Status-based Pain Assessment (0-50) score (27 ± 8.0, <i>r</i> = -0.4342, <i>P</i> < .0001). Functional Status-based Pain Assessment item means ranged from 2.1 to 3.3. Cronbach's alpha was 0.91. Exploratory factor analysis showed that all Functional Status-based Pain Assessment items loaded on a single factor. Confirmatory factor analysis found adequate convergent and discriminant validity and showed strong fit of the model to the data. Item response theory analysis showed item discrimination ranging from 0.56 to 4.1, while difficulty ranged from -2.8 to 7.5. The Functional Status-based Pain Assessment shows strong correlation with daily Numeric Rating Scale, is multidimensional, and demonstrates strong construct validity. It may improve assessment of SCD vaso-occlusive crisis pain and may enhance vaso-occlusive crisis discharge discussions."

To describe adult and adolescent sickle cell disease (SCD) and outcomes in northern Ghana. This was a retrospective cohort study of SCD patients aged 13 years and above, admitted between January 1, 2021 and December 31, 2022 at the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital. The data was summarized with descriptive statistics and a multivariate logistics regression analysis was fitted to identify factors independently associated with prolonged hospital stay of more than 4 days. Of the 326 admissions, 68.9% regularly attended their sickle cell clinics. Approximately 3% of all admissions into the internal medicine ward were due to SCD. Commonest complications observed were painful vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) (78.1%), infection (51.2%), and hyperhemolysis (24.0%). Presented as adjusted odds ratio (95% CI), the predictors of prolonged hospital stay were: presence of comorbidities, 2.71 [(1.28, 5.97), <i>p</i> = 0.011]; infection, 1.78 [(1.08, 2.94), <i>p</i> = 0.024]; acute chest syndrome, 2.42 [(1.22, 4.970), <i>p</i> = 0.013]; hyperhemolysis, 2.02 [(1.08, 3.80), <i>p</i> = 0.028]; sequestration crisis, 3.80 [(1.50, 11.0), <i>p</i> = 0.008]; and requirement for transfusion, 3.58 [(1.80, 7.36), <i>p</i> < 0.001]. Mortality rate was 2.5%. SCD and its related complications constitute a significant proportion of all admissions into the adult medical ward. Approximately one in every three Ghanaian adult and adolescent SCD patients does not regularly attend the SCD clinic.

    "abstract": "Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is potentially curative for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). Both SCD and HCT cause kidney damage. This study analyzed data from 160 patients who received nonmyelablative HCT for SCD. Renal function was assessed at baseline and annually for 3years. The rate of new-onset eGFR <60 ml/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup> was low (2.8%). Rapid kidney function decline in the first year post-HCT was noted in 7.5% of patients but was not associated with subsequently worse renal function. The eGFR decreased post-HCT (1 year: -7.19 p < 0.0001, 2 year: -11.32 p < 0.0001, 3 year: -12.37 ml/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup> p < 0.0001). Mean eGFR remained within normal limits throughout the follow-up period (1 year:119, 2 year:115, 3 year:113 ml/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup>). Hyperfiltration rates decreased with a corresponding increase in patients with normal eGFR post-HCT. Therefore, the decline in eGFR after HCT may represent preservation of renal function. The prevalence of kidney damage increased transiently but, by 3 years post-HCT, was not significantly changed from baseline. Most cases of kidney damage were due to albuminuria. AKI, noted early post-HCT in 39% of patients, was most commonly stage 1 and was associated with decreased survival (p = 0.03). Larger studies with longer follow-up are required to explore the effects of HCT on renal function in patients with SCD."

With the development of gene editing technology, activating γ-globin for treating β-thalassemia and SCD has been highly successful. However, δ-globin, as another important potential therapeutic target, has few related studies. Gene editing technology introduced cis-acting elements, including NF-Y, KLF1, GATA1, and TAL1, into the regulatory region of <i>HBD</i>, successfully activating the expression of δ-globin. It was confirmed that the activation effect of δ-globin was closely related to the location of the introduced cis-acting elements. In this study, the mutation creates a de novo binding site for KLF1 at -85∼93 bp upstream of the transcription start site of the <i>HBD</i> gene, as well as the site for TAL1 and GATA1 cobinding motifs at -59 to ∼-78 bp, which could effectively activate δ-globin."

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited blood disorder characterized by the production of abnormal hemoglobin S (HbS), leading to the deformation of red blood cells into a sickle shape under low oxygen conditions. These deformed cells impede blood flow, causing vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs), which result in severe pain, multiorgan damage, and increased mortality. Despite advancements in understanding the pathophysiology and management of VOCs, optimal pain management remains a significant challenge. This review aims to evaluate patient-controlled analgesia compared to standard opioid analgesic therapy in pain management among patients with SCD. The relevant studies will be searched using a well-formulated search strategy using databases such as PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science. It will be screened by two reviewers independently (screening phase), and further, the third reviewer may solve if any discrepancies are noted. The primary outcomes will be pain reduction in intensity and frequency of breakthrough pain reported using a standard pain scale. The secondary outcomes will be adverse reactions, mortality rate, length of hospital stay, and 30-day readmission. Then, the eligible studies are assessed for risk for bias and quality by two review members using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for observational studies or Cochrane Risk of Bias assessment tool version 2. Besides, it provides strong evidence in support of patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) as an optimal pain management strategy compared to other pain management strategies. It also explores PCA's safety profiles and common adverse events to provide evidence-based recommendations and establish a standard of care for treating SCD patients. PRISMA format of reporting systematic review and meta-analysis protocols will be followed while presenting the results of this study. The findings potentially influence clinical practice, healthcare policy, and future research thereby guiding the development of evidence-based standards for VOC management in SCD patients.

    "abstract": "Abnormal hemoglobin, or hemoglobinopathy, affects about 7% of the global population. Major hemoglobinopathies like beta-thalassemia and sickle cell disease require regular blood transfusions, leading to chronic iron overload. This review examines the efficacy and safety of deferiprone, an oral iron chelator, in managing iron overload in pediatric patients with transfusion-dependent conditions. Data were sourced from PubMed, Google Scholar, and relevant articles, focusing on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published between 2010 and 2023. The search terms included \"deferiprone,\" \"iron chelation,\" \"transfusion,\" \"iron overload,\" \"hemoglobinopathies,\" and \"thalassemia.\" Three RCTs met the inclusion criteria, involving 521 pediatric patients. The START trial demonstrated that early-start deferiprone significantly reduced iron load compared to placebo, with no severe adverse events. The DEEP-2 study found deferiprone non-inferior to deferasirox in terms of efficacy and safety. Another trial highlighted the benefits of early deferiprone therapy in delaying iron overload symptoms without serious side effects. Common adverse effects included pyrexia, nasopharyngitis, and decreased neutrophil count, but no significant differences in growth parameters, creatinine, or prolactin levels were observed. Deferiprone shows significant promise in managing iron overload in pediatric patients, with comparable effectiveness to existing therapies and a favorable safety profile. Its oral administration is advantageous for young children. However, long-term studies are needed to fully understand its safety and efficacy. Addressing challenges such as patient compliance and adverse effects through education, personalized medicine, and advanced monitoring techniques can further improve treatment outcomes for beta-thalassemia patients."

Recent studies have reported altered brain connectivity in pain processing, highlighting a new avenue for developing sensitive measures of SCD severity. <b><i>Method:</i></b> This cross-sectional study used graph theory concepts to analyze effective connectivity in individuals with SCD and healthy controls during rest and motor imagery tasks. The SCD group was further divided into two subgroups based on pain intensity (less pain or more pain) during the evaluation. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Individuals with SCD and chronic pain exhibited a distinct brain connectivity signature compared to healthy individuals and within pain sublevels. <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> Chronic pain in SCD shows a unique brain connectivity pattern when compared to healthy subjects and across different pain levels. The results support the hypothesis that chronic pain condition is associated with decreased interhub connections and increased intrahub connections for specific brain rhythms. Furthermore, the small-world parameter can distinguish SCD individuals from controls and differentiate pain levels within SCD individuals, offering a promising biomarker for clinical assessment."

    "abstract": "Increasing attention has been paid to investigations on how social determinants of health (SDOH; e.g., income, employment, education, housing, etc.) impact health outcomes. However, these variables are often not collected in routine clinical practice. As a consequence, researchers may attempt to link retrospective medical records to those datasets that can provide additional SDOH information, such as the Area Deprivation Index (ADI). However, time-consuming geographic calculations can deter these analyses. To reduce this burden, the ezADI R package performs batched geocoder mapping on inputted addresses, constructs Federal Information Processing Series (FIPS) codes, and then merges these data with ADI scores. The applicability and feasibility of this ezADI tool was tested on a sample of patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). Individuals with SCD are at risk for developing serious comorbidities; disadvantageous SDOH may increase this risk, in turn leading to higher rates of hospital utilization and longer lengths of stay on admission. In this sample of 1,105 individuals with SCD in Tennessee (53.8% female, 97.5% African American), higher ADI scores (i.e., more neighborhood disadvantage) were significantly associated with increased hospital utilization (rho = 0.093, p = 0.002) and longer lengths of stay (rho = 0.069, p = 0.021). These areas could be targeted with neighborhood-level interventions and other resources to improve SDOH. This study provides proof of concept that the ezADI tool simplifies geocoding calculations to allow researchers to link datasets with the ADI and assess associations between SDOH factors and health outcomes."

However, the phenotypic variability of SCA cannot be explained by genetic factors alone. Hence, the need to determine other correlates of SCA severity such as perceived stress and social support. This was a hospital-based cross-sectional study involving 60 participants aged 8-17 years selected using simple random sampling technique. Standard rating scales (i.e., SCA scoring system, perceived stress scale, and child and adolescent social support scale) were used to assess the severity of SCA, perceived stress and social support, respectively. Foetal haemoglobin (HbF) was estimated using high performance liquid chromatography. The psychosocial predictors of sickle cell severity were analyzed using multivariate linear regression. There was a negative moderate significant correlation between SCA severity and domains of social support: parents' (rho = -0.30, p = 0.03) and classmates' (rho = -0.50, p < 0.001). Of all the variables studied, only classmates' perceived social support emerged as the significant predictor of SCA severity when other confounders such as HbF were controlled for (β = -0.37, t = 2.41, p = 0.02). The findings of this study support the available literature on the mediating effect of social support on SCA severity. These findings buttress the need for clinicians to consider psychosocial methods (e.g., family and classmates' support) in improving disease outcomes."

The measurements were performed using the Topcon Maestro SD-OCT 3D and then mapped onto the 9 quadrants of the macular grid established by the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study. The studied variables were: age, gender, number of annual vaso-occlusive events; prophylactic treatment, visual acuity corrected for distance and near, sickle cell retinopathy; mean macular thickness, mean central (foveolar), and mean temporal inner, nasal inner, superior inner, inferior inner, superior outer, inferior outer, nasal outer, and temporal outer retinal thicknesses. The differences were considered statistically significant for P values < 0.05. Mean macular thickness was 271.3±20.9μm in homozygous SS sickle cell patients versus 272.4±20.9μm in non-sickle cell patients (P=0.891). This decreases with age; for each year, the macula thins by 0.72μm. The central macular thinning rate was 40.26%. There was significant thinning in sickle cell patients in the nasal outer (P=0.05), temporal outer (P=0.002) and inferior inner (P=0.02) quadrants and non-significant thickening in the inferior outer quadrant.

We conducted a systematic search of three databases in April 2024 (PubMed, Scopus, and PsycINFO). The review was registered with Open Science Framework (DOI: 10.17605/OSF.IO/956AV). All titles, abstracts, and full texts for papers that appeared to meet criteria were independently reviewed by two members of the research team. Inclusion criteria were pediatric or young adult age and use of CEnR for a psychological SCD intervention. Data were extracted from articles meeting these criteria. The search yielded 235 original articles, of which eight met the inclusion criteria. These articles showed that the involvement levels of community collaborators (patients, families, and community-based organizations) varied across research phases. Notable gaps in the literature were: (1) few studies reported utilizing CEnR methods, (2) variability in language/terms used to describe CEnR methods, (3) limited demographic data about community collaborators, and (4) a lack of description of CEnR frameworks guiding intervention development and evaluation. This scoping review found few studies describing the use of CEnR methods in a way that would facilitate reproducibility. Recommendations include using MeSH CEnR keywords, identifying CEnR methods and frameworks, and including specific information about community when possible (e.g., demographic information, meeting frequency, etc.)."

    "abstract": "The transcription repressor BCL11A governs the switch from fetal to adult hemoglobin during development. By targeting BCL11A, fetal hemoglobin expression can be de-repressed to substitute for defective adult hemoglobin in inherited diseases including beta-thalassemia and sickle-cell anemia. BCL11A has six CCHH-type zinc fingers, of which domains 4-6 are necessary and sufficient for dsDNA binding. Here, we focus on a putative ZNF at the N-terminus of BCL11A (residues 46-72), Z0, thought to modulate oligomerization of the transcription repressor. Using NMR and CD spectroscopy at low concentrations that favor the monomer, Z0 is shown to be a thermostable CCHC zinc finger with a pM dissociation constant for zinc. The NMR structure of Z0 has a prototypical beta-beta-alpha fold, with a hydrophobic knob comprising about half the structure. The unusual proportion of hydrophobic residues in Z0 led us to investigate if this is a more general feature of zinc fingers that do not bind dsDNA. We used the ZF and WebLogo servers to examine sequences of zinc fingers with demonstrated DNA-binding function, non-DNA-binders, and the CCHC-type family of protein-binders. DNA-binders are distinguished by contiguous stretches of high-scoring zinc fingers. Non-DNA-binders show a depletion of polar residues at the positions expected to contact nucleotides and increased sequence divergence, making these domains more likely to be annotated as atypical, degenerate, or to be missed as zinc fingers. We anticipate these sequence patterns will help distinguish DNA-binders from non-binders, an open problem in the functional understanding of zinc-finger motifs."

    "abstract": "Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease (KFD) is a rare, benign, and self-limiting disorder characterized by necrotizing lymphadenitis, primarily affecting young adults and adolescents. Its etiology and pathogenesis remain unclear and complex. Common presentations include constitutional symptoms such as lymphadenopathy and fever. This study reports the case of a 15-year-old girl who presented with a fever of unknown origin and was found to have lymphadenopathy, which was associated with sickle cell disease (SCD). The diagnosis was confirmed through the pathological features of lymph node biopsy, with the patient successfully treated with steroids and hydroxychloroquine. She remained stable on follow-up, with no recurrence of fever or lymphadenopathy."

    "abstract": "Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) is a routinely performed procedure for symptomatic cholelithiasis, known for its minimal invasiveness and favorable outcomes; however, intraoperative gallbladder perforation and subsequent stone spillage can lead to rare but serious complications such as abscess formation and fistulization. A 38-year-old male patient with a history of sickle cell disease and prior LC presented multiple times with recurrent right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain and sepsis, and over the course of two years, imaging and endoscopic evaluations revealed persistent subhepatic abscesses with a fistulous tract involving the ascending colon. Intraoperative exploration ultimately uncovered a retained gallstone serving as the nidus of this chronic inflammatory process, and a laparoscopic right hemicolectomy with the removal of the stone was performed, leading to the resolution of the patient's symptoms. Although many retained gallstones remain clinically silent, a fraction present late with abscesses or fistulas, complicating diagnosis and increasing morbidity; therefore, comprehensive imaging studies, including CT scans and colonoscopy, are essential for identifying potential complications, and definitive surgical intervention is often required to remove the affected bowel segment and the offending stone. This case underscores the importance of meticulous intraoperative technique and vigilance in patients who develop unexplained or recurrent abdominal sepsis after LC, highlighting that early recognition of this rare complication can guide appropriate management and ultimately reduce the risk of severe morbidity."

    "title": "Comparative analysis of mortality patterns and treatment strategies in thalassaemia and sickle cell disease patients: A 12-year study.",
    "abstract": "This study examined mortality rates among 2475 patients with thalassaemia and sickle cell disease (SCD) per year over 12 years in Greece, recording 335 deaths (27.92/year), with an overall mortality rate of 1.13% per year. The primary aim was to identify causes of death, comorbidities, treatment efficacy and iron overload prevalence. Of the deaths, 239 were attributed to thalassaemia and 96 to SCD. For thalassaemia patients, cardiac failure, hepatocellular carcinoma and sepsis were the leading causes of death, with no neoplasms observed in β+/β+ genotypes. In SCD, sepsis, liver failure and stroke were the predominant causes, with sepsis-related deaths higher in frequently transfused patients. The median age of death was significantly lower in thalassaemia (50 years) compared to SCD (58.49 years, p < 0.001). Differences in comorbidities and treatment effectiveness highlight the need for improved management strategies. Addressing iron overload, optimizing chelation therapy and expanding hydroxyurea use in SCD patients could enhance survival and quality of life. Strengthening treatment protocols and monitoring may reduce mortality, emphasizing the importance of targeted interventions in haemoglobinopathies."

    "abstract": "The Csa blood group antigen was identified more than 50 years ago but its genetic basis has yet to be elucidated. All our recent genomic investigation has failed to resolve the genetic basis of this enigmatic antigen. By investigating the association of the HNA-3a/b polymorphism (rs2288904-G/A) in SLC44A2 with clinical features of Sickle Cell Disease (SCD), we incidentally discovered that rare subjects with the homozygous HNA-3b/b genotype also carry the uncommon Cs(a-) phenotype. We genotyped this SNP in a cohort of 25 Cs(a-) subjects and found that all of them showed a HNA-3b/b genotype. This result suggests that the high-prevalence allele with rs2288904 (HNA-3a; 455G) encoding Arg152 encodes the high-prevalence Csa. Accordingly, anti-Csa does not react with SLC44A2null RBCs, SLC44A2 knockout K562 cells, and K562 cells expressing HNA-3b, confirming that the Csa and Csb antigens are carried on this protein. Furthermore, mass spectrometry analysis of SLC44A2 from neutrophils and RBCs, along with serological investigation, showed that, despite HNA-3a and Csa having the same genetic basis, anti-HNA-3a and anti-Csa recognize different epitopes on the SLC44A2 protein. Overall, our data resolve the genetic bases of the Cs(a-) and Cs(b-) blood phenotypes, with new insights on the anti-HNA-3a specificity."

    "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified numerous genetic variants linked to human diseases, mostly located in non-coding regions of the genome, particularly in putative enhancers. However, functional assessment of the non-coding GWAS variants has progressed at slow pace, since the functions of the vast majority of genomic enhancers have not been defined, impeding interpretation of disease-susceptibility variants. The HBS1L-MYB intergenic region harbors multiple SNPs associated with clinical erythroid parameters, including fetal hemoglobin levels, a feature impacting disease severity of beta-hemoglobinopathies such as sickle cell anemia and beta-thalassemia. HBS1L-MYB variants cluster in the vicinity of several MYB enhancers, altering MYB expression and globin switching. We and others have highlighted the conserved human MYB - 84kb enhancer, known as the - 81kb enhancer in the mouse, as likely candidate linked to these traits. We report here the generation of a Myb - 81kb enhancer knock-out mouse model, and shed light for the first time on its impact on steady state erythropoiesis and in beta-thalassemia in vivo."

A comprehensive search of PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science was conducted, focusing on studies involving pediatric patients. Fifteen studies were included, with 11 assessing the utility and safety of OFA and 4 comparing it to IVFA. These studies covered 581 eyes from 464 patients. The most common dosing protocol for OFA involved 25 mg/kg of 10 % fluorescein dye, with various dilution solutions and fasting requirements enhancing image quality. Adverse effects were minimal, with mild reactions such as itching or nausea observed in 0.019 % of patients. OFA demonstrated good diagnostic value across various pathologies, including retinal vasculopathies, uveitis, disc edema, and Coats disease. OFA is a feasible imaging modality that is a less invasive and better-tolerated alternative to IVFA in the pediatric population, providing high-quality diagnostic images with fewer adverse effects. Our review highlights the need for standardized administration protocols and further research into optimizing dosing and ingestion techniques to enhance image quality and diagnostic utility."

    "abstract": "Crizanlizumab has previously shown efficacy as a potent disease-modifying therapy for alleviating vaso-occlusive crisis in sickle cell disease. The SUSTAIN study showed a reduction of vaso-occlusive crises in patients treated with 5 mg/kg crizanlizumab, compared with placebo. The STAND study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of two doses (5·0 mg/kg and 7·5 mg/kg) of crizanlizumab in sickle cell disease. Herein, we report the primary analysis results of STAND. STAND is a phase 3, multicentre, randomised, double-blind study of patients with sickle cell disease aged 12 years and older done at 65 sites in 21 countries. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive either 5·0 mg/kg of crizanlizumab, 7·5 mg/kg of crizanlizumab, or placebo, in addition to standard of care, for 1 year. The primary endpoint was the annualised rate of vaso-occlusive crises leading to a health-care visit over the first-year post-randomisation. The secondary objectives included assessing crizanlizumab's safety. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03814746) and is ongoing. Between July 26, 2019, and Aug 31, 2022, 252 patients were enrolled and treated. The primary analysis showed an adjusted annualised rate of vaso-occlusive crises of 2·49 (95% CI 1·90-3·26) in the crizanlizumab 5·0 mg/kg group, 2·04 (1·56-2·65) in the 7·5 mg/kg group, and 2·30 (1·75-3·01) in the placebo group. Ratios of adjusted annualised rates of vaso-occlusive crises leading to health-care visits were 1·08 (95% CI 0·76-1·55, p>0·999) for 5·0 mg/kg and 0·89 (0·62-1·27, p>0·999) for 7·5 mg/kg vs placebo. The incidence of adverse events was similar across treatment groups. Grade 3 or higher adverse events were observed less frequently in the placebo and crizanlizumab 7·5 mg/kg groups (27 [32%] of 85 and 32 [39%] of 83, respectively) than in the 5·0 mg/kg group (47 [56%] of 84). Serious adverse events (all grades) were also less frequent in the placebo and crizanlizumab 7·5 mg/kg groups (26 [31%] and 22 [27%], respectively) than in the 5·0 mg/kg group (35 [42%]). The STAND study supports the safety and tolerability of crizanlizumab in the treatment of sickle cell disease. The primary analysis showed no significant difference in efficacy between crizanlizumab and placebo. Factors including the COVID-19 pandemic, global enrolment with varied patterns of health-care use and vaso-occlusive crisis management as well as the commercial availability of crizanlizumab might have influenced these results. The safety profile of crizanlizumab was consistent with that in previous reports, without new safety concerns. Novartis Pharmaceuticals."

    "title": "Balancing benefits and burdens: a systematic review on ethical and social dimensions of gene and cell therapies for hereditary blood diseases.",
    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) and Diamond-Blackfan anemia syndrome (DBAS) are two hereditary blood diseases that present significant challenges to patients, their caregivers, and the healthcare system. Both conditions cause severe health complications and have limited treatment options, leaving many individuals without access to curative therapies like hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Recent advancements in gene and cell therapies offer the potential for a new curative option, marking a pivotal shift in the management of these debilitating diseases. However, the implementation of these therapies necessitates a nuanced understanding of the ethical and social implications. In this mixed methods systematic review, we explore the responsible development and implementation of gene and cell therapies for SCD and DBAS and aim to sketch a path toward ethically and socially sound implementation. Drawing upon principles of Responsible Research & Innovation and the 4A framework of availability, accessibility, acceptability, and affordability, we thematically analyze existing research to illuminate the ethical and social dimensions of these therapies. Following established PRISMA and JBI Manual guidelines, a search across multiple databases yielded 51 peer-reviewed studies with publication dates ranging from 1991 to 2023. Our thematic analysis shows that the theme of acceptability is heavily shaped by interactions between patients, caregivers, healthcare professionals and researchers, influencing treatment decisions and shaping the development of curative gene and cell therapies. Despite the generally positive perspective on these therapies, factors like the limited treatment options, financial constraints, healthcare professional attitudes, and (historical) mistrust can impede stakeholder decision-making. While acceptability focuses on individual decisions, the themes of availability, accessibility, and affordability are interconnected and primarily driven by healthcare systems, where high research and development costs, commercialization and a lack of transparency challenge equitable access to these therapies. This diminishes the acceptability for patients, revealing a complex interdependence of the themes. The findings suggest the need for improved communication strategies in clinical practice to facilitate informed decision-making for patients and caregivers. Policy development should focus on addressing pricing disparities and promoting international collaboration to ensure equitable access to therapies.

The region is significantly affected, with 78.7% of patients with SCD residing in sub-Saharan Africa and over 515 000 newborns diagnosed annually. Historically, African health systems have struggled to provide optimal care for patients with SCD, resulting in high under-5 mortality and severe childhood morbidity. Scientific innovations and stakeholder engagement offer hope for improving SCD outcomes. To explore the role of high-level partnerships and scientific innovation in advancing SCD care and research in Africa, focusing on the contributions and strategic engagements of the SickleInAfrica, as highlighted at the 77th United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) and the US-Africa Leaders' Summit. SickleInAfrica, comprising eight countries, leverages a robust infrastructure for SCD research and care. The consortium has established a comprehensive SCD database and a patient registry in each of the consortium sites that includes demographic details, clinical diagnosis, management details and follow-ups/visits. Currently, over 34 000 patients with SCD are enrolled, making it the largest globally. It has also contextually adapted clinical guidelines for managing SCD for all levels of care. The high-level engagements at the 77th UNGA held in September 2022 in New York and the US-Africa Leaders' Summit held in December 2022 in Washington DC promoted SCD awareness and partnerships. The UNGA session emphasised biomedical science, implementation research and partnerships in therapeutic development, while the US-Africa Leaders' Summit session focused on Global Partnerships for SCD: Advancing Science and Technology for Health in Africa. High-level engagements facilitate cross-border dialogues, underscoring the importance of partnerships from grassroots to global alliances. Key outcomes include increased awareness, policy advocacy and the establishment of SCD Centres of Excellence and genomics capacity-building initiatives. Sustainable efforts require robust partnerships, government involvement, community awareness and equitable access to advanced therapies."

    "abstract": "One of the components of comprehensive care and interventions in managing patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) is red blood cell transfusion. This has helped in reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with SCD. Individuals who undergo multiple red cell transfusions are faced with alloimmunization which makes it difficult to source compatible blood for them. This often leads to haemolytic reactions and sometimes death of the patients. In this study, we determined the prevalence and pattern of alloimmunization in patients with SCD. This was a cross-sectional study of 205 patients with SCD aged 1-45 years, attending the sickle cell clinic at the University of Abuja Teaching Hospital, Gwagwalada, Abuja. Antibody detection and identification were done using the tube technique (Lone Laboratories UK). The data was analyzed and reported in percentages and descriptive statistics. Of the 205 participants, 115 (56.1 %) were males while 90 (43.9 %) were females. 99 (48.8 %) of the patients had been transfused two or more times while 49(23.9 %) were transfused only once. Fifty-seven (27.8 %) participants have never had a transfusion. The following blood group systems were observed in 26 alloimmunized SCD participants; Rh (D/E/e/C/Cw) 46 %, Kell19.2 %, Lewis 11.5 %, MNS 3.8 %, Duffy 23.0 %. All 26 participants have had more than one episode of blood transfusion. The prevalence rate was 17.6 % and Rh alloantibodies were common among patients with SCD who have received multiple transfusions. Proper blood detection and identification of alloantibodies should be promoted before blood transfusion to manage these patients better."

    "abstract": "Sickle cell trait (SCT) is present in participants who possess a single copy of the βS-globin gene mutation. Although most affected individuals are asymptomatic, SCT is a well-established risk factor for venous thrombosis and renal complications, including chronic and end-stage kidney disease. After prolonged hypoxia, SCT red blood cells (RBCs) can undergo sickling, and hypoxia-mediated RBC sickling can be enhanced by cellular dehydration, hyperosmolarity, and/or acidosis. Some or all of these conditions may be encountered in the nidus of venous thrombi and in the medulla of the kidney. We sought to determine whether Townes sickle trait (AS) mice develop kidney dysfunction and manifest enhanced venous thrombosis. We demonstrated that the harsh environment within the inner medulla induces RBC sickling in vitro and in vivo and is associated with kidney-related pathologies, including impaired urinary concentration, albuminuria, and declining renal function, closely mimicking those seen in human SCT. In the inferior vena cava model of venous thrombosis, extreme and prolonged hypoxia in the core of RBC-rich venous thrombi resulted in irreversible RBC sickling and larger clots in Townes AS mice than AA controls (littermates expressing hemoglobin A only). Our results support the use of Townes AS mice in future studies investigating mechanisms of venous thrombosis and chronic kidney disease in SCT."

    "abstract": "Chronic and acute pain are major comorbidities of sickle cell disease (SCD). Both peripheral and central nervous system mechanisms underlie SCD pain. We investigated the potential roles of endogenous fatty acyl derivatives with endocannabinoid-like activity; using targeted lipidomics of fatty acid ethanolamides and monoacylglycerols, we observed significant reduction of spinal palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) in the humanized, transgenic sickle (HbSS)-BERK mouse model of SCD when compared with healthy HbAA control mice. PEA is a paracannabinoid lipid mediator that acts as a putative mast cell stabilizer and has been evaluated clinically for mechanical, cold, and joint pain, which are all features of SCD pain. Increased p38-MAPK activity in the spinal cord and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons, and cutaneous mast cell activation, contribute to chronic hyperalgesia in sickle cell mice. We provide the first evidence that inhibiting endogenous PEA degradation and administration of exogenous PEA, reduces measures of chronic hyperalgesia via inhibition of peripheral and central mechanisms of pain hypersensitivity in sickle cell mice. PEA alleviated spinal inflammation, oxidative stress, and p38-MAPK activity; in the periphery, inhibited p38-MAPK phosphorylation and nuclear translocation in DRG neurons, reduced mast cell extracellular trap formation, and markers of inflammation in HbSS mice. In addition, PEA treatment prevented and ameliorated acute hyperalgesia incited by hypoxia/reoxygenation challenge in sickle cell mice. Pain may persist even after hydroxyurea and curative therapies in SCD. PEA displayed safety in several clinical studies and has the translational potential to treat pain in SCD without the burden of additional medications."

This was followed by Pfizer's abrupt decision in September 2024 to pull voxelotor from global markets owing to higher mortality in those on the drug vs placebo. These drugs highlight the importance and limitations of the FDA's accelerated approval process. In addition, the impact of these events, without transparent messaging, potentially threatened the fragile trust that providers have more recently been able to build with the SCD population regarding the medical system and research. Although there is a need for new therapies in SCD, we must prioritize both safety and efficacy and maintain trust in this population."

    "abstract": "Children with sickle cell anemia (SCA) frequently develop progressive neurocognitive impairment. We aimed to determine effects of hydroxyurea therapy on neurocognitive function in Ugandan children with SCA by comparing levels at enrollment to a planned 18-month interim assessment. Ugandan children (N = 264) aged 3 to 9 years attending SCA clinic were enrolled and treated in a 30-month, single-arm, open-label trial with escalation to maximum tolerated dose. Sibling controls (N = 110) without SCA underwent parallel neurocognitive testing to establish age-normalized z scores for comparison. At enrollment, mean participant age was 5.6 ± 1.2 years, with comparable socioeconomic status and caregiver education vs. controls. Month 18 mean daily hydroxyurea dose was 25.4 mg/kg. We found significantly improved participant z scores vs. baseline in all 3 neurocognitive domains tested: cognition: -0.54 ± 1.10 vs. -0.07 ± 1.16, P < .001; attention: -0.07 ± 1.01 vs. 0.27 ± 0.84, P < .001; and executive function: -0.06 ± 0.62 vs. 0.08 ± 0.72, P = .010. No month-18 measures differed from controls. Participants with SCA and cognitive impairment declined from 8.7% at enrollment to 4.0%, vs. 1.6% of controls; with decreased mean TCD velocity. Improved neurocognitive treatment z-scores were associated with higher baseline scores and socioeconomic status, hydroxyurea-associated lower TCD velocity, and hematological-induced effects, eg higher hemoglobin. Despite improvement, unadjusted neurocognitive scores remained negatively associated with age. Hydroxyurea therapy improved SCA neurocognitive function in sub-Saharan children, potentially aided by practice effects. Early treatment is needed for optimal impact. Our ongoing trial will assess impact from longer-term hydroxyurea therapy. This trial was registered at www.ClinicalTrials.gov as #NCT04750707."

Ischemic priapism is the most common form and is characterized by low arterial blood flow and absent venous outflow. Some potential triggers of ischemic priapism include malignancy, sickle cell disease, illicit drug use, and certain medications. Prazosin, an alpha-1 adrenergic antagonist, is used for the treatment of chronic hypertension, benign prostate hyperplasia, and (post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) related nightmares. The alpha-adrenergic antagonistic effect of prazosin results in decreased venous blood flow, including to the smooth muscle tissue located within the corpus cavernosum. Slowly titrating prazosin allows the body to adapt to the vasodilatory effects of the medication. Without titration, a dysregulation in blood flow to the penile vasculature can result in prolonged erection. We report a case of priapism that resulted due to rapid titration of prazosin."

    "abstract": "Sickle cell anemia (SCA) presents a complex interplay of factors, with the production of high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the chronic inflammatory process leading to chronic oxidative stress. In this context, efficient action of antioxidant systems becomes crucial, with particular emphasis on peroxiredoxins (PRDXs) due to their abundance and vital roles. Our primary objective was to establish associations between gene and protein expression of PRDXs 1, 2, and 6, as well as their reducers TRX1, TRXR1, and SRX1, with the characteristic hyperoxidative status observed in SCA patients. Concomitantly, we assessed the production of other essential antioxidant enzymes (SOD1, CAT, and GPX1) in reticulocytes and erythrocytes and explored mRNA levels of the NRF2/KEAP1/PKCδ complex. Our comprehensive analysis revealed a ∼ 3-fold elevation in ROS levels in erythrocytes of patients compared to healthy individuals. However, the NRF2/KEAP1/PKCδ complex exhibited a significant reduction in gene expression, hinting that another transcription factor may regulate the antioxidant response among SCA patients. In addition, the pattern of increased transcript levels of antioxidants in SCA patients was not associated with their protein levels, indicating a possible degradation by proteasome. The protein content of PRDX2 showed a significant reduction, indicating an increased vulnerability of these cells to oxidative damage. Intriguingly, both PRDXs 1 and 2 exhibited significant increases in the plasma of SCA patients, indicating that, besides their well-known intracellular antioxidant role, these enzymes may also play a vital extracellular role in modulating inflammation in these individuals. Our findings unveil novel insights into the redox metabolism adaption of erythroid cells in response to the presence of HbS in homozygosity, thus, into the complex SCA pathophysiology. Moreover, our study reveals the simultaneous presence of both PRDXs 1 and 2 in the plasma of these patients, thereby offering valuable implications for potential prognostic and therapeutic avenues."

Our randomized controlled trial found significant reductions in pain in youth receiving digital cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) vs education control. However, little is known about factors that moderate the effects of CBT in adolescents with SCD. This secondary data analysis aims to identify adolescent and family characteristics that moderate treatment effects on pain outcomes in 111 adolescents aged 12 to 18 with SCD (M = 14.9, SD = 1.9, girls = 59%) and their caregivers. Adolescents were randomly assigned to digital CBT (N = 57) or education control (N = 54). Digital CBT included separate content for parents/caregivers (ie, a website to learn problem-solving skills and behavioral and communication strategies) and youths (ie, a smartphone app and website to learn pain management skills). Outcomes were assessed at pretreatment, posttreatment (2 months), and follow-up (6 months). Potential moderators included pretreatment variables (ie, adolescent variables: age, executive functioning, anxiety, depression; parent variables: psychological distress, protective behaviors, family functioning). There was a significant overall effect modification on pain intensity outcomes from pretreatment parent psychological distress (P = 0.012), where CBT appeared more effective among those with elevated parental distress. Differential intervention effects were observed across multiple potential moderator groups, though most of these differences did not reach statistical significance. Our study underscores the importance of family factors in understanding the efficacy of digital CBT for adolescent SCD pain, pointing to the need for future research to optimize CBT through targeted family-focused strategies."

    "abstract": "Hemoglobinopathies are the most common inherited disorders in the Mediterranean region, including Iraq, with different frequencies and molecular features. They represent an important health problem in Iraq. Several studies have addressed the prevalence of hemoglobinopathy in Iraq, but no specific research has addressed its prevalence in Zakho city, Kurdistan Region, Iraq. Thus, this study was conducted to address this issue. A prospective cross-sectional study was conducted in a premarital screening center at Zakho Emergency Teaching Hospital, involving 11,910 Kurdish persons attending premarital screening investigations. Blood samples were collected from all participants for complete blood counts and sickling tests. A cut-off value of hemoglobin (Hb) concentrations (<13.0 gm/dl in males, <12.0 gm/dl in females), mean cell volume (MCV) <80 fl and/or mean cell hemoglobin (MCH) <27 pg, and the results of the sickling test were used to categorize the participants into three groups: group I, normal (normal Hb, MCV, and MCH, and negative sickling test); group II, individuals with MCV < 80 fl and/or MCH < 27 pg, with or without anemia, and negative sickling test; group III, sickle positive (individuals with a positive sickling test, with or without anemia, regardless of MCV and/or MCH values). Groups II and III underwent further evaluations by morphology, reticulocyte count, hemoglobin-H preparation, iron studies, and cation exchange high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). β-thalassemia trait was diagnosed by hypochromic microcytic red cell indices and increased hemoglobin A2 (HbA2) (>3.5%). The sickle cell trait was diagnosed by the presence of a band at the S region at HPLC with a positive sickling test. Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) was diagnosed by hypochromic microcytic anemia and reduced transferrin saturation (<15%) and/or ferritin (<15 mg/L). Descriptive statistical analyses were conducted to define significant differences between the study's findings. A total of 963 (8.09%) of the studied participants were in group II. Further investigations on these 963 cases confirmed a diagnosis of IDA in 610 (5.12%). β-thalassemia trait was detected in 308 cases, with an overall prevalence of 2.59%. δβ-thalassemia trait was detected in nine (0.076%) of the studied participants. A professional diagnosis of α-thalassemia was given to 36 (0.30%) of those with hypochromic microcytic red cell indices, normal iron studies, and HPLC results. A positive sickling test was seen in 48 participants and confirmed by HPLC as a sickle cell trait with a prevalence of 0.4%. The consanguinity rate among couples was 28.8%. Neither case of HbC or HbD trait, nor combined hemoglobinopathy, was detected in the current study. Furthermore, no differences were found between the prevalence of both β thalassemia and sickle cell trait with either sex and/or religion, with a p-value of 0.07, 0.07, 0.532, and 0.78, respectively. The prevalence of hemoglobinopathy in Zakho city is lower than in other regions of Iraq but still constitutes a significant burden on health services and financial resources. Careful interpretations of red cell indices, together with intensified premarital screening and counseling programs, coupled with an urgent need to increase awareness about the effects of consanguinity marriages on the prevalence of autosomal recessive disorders, can further reduce the incidence of hemoglobinopathies."

    "abstract": "Microcytosis is commonly encountered in primary care. Among patients with normal iron stores or compatible family history, hemoglobin electrophoresis, traditionally performed with gel electrophoresis and now through combination capillary electrophoresis/high-performance liquid chromatography, can diagnose thalassemic disorders or, rarely, a hemoglobinopathy. We present a case of an incidentally discovered microcytosis in a 34-year-old male patient where the workup led to a diagnosis of Hemoglobin S with Hereditary Persistence of Fetal Hemoglobin (HbS-HPFH syndrome). The diagnosis led providers to re-evaluate the patient's chronic hip pain, upon which the patient was found to have bilateral osteonecrosis of the femurs. Microcytosis is a lab abnormality that is often asymptomatic and, therefore, may be ignored or overlooked. When encountering microcytosis in primary care, it is important to identify the etiology using a brief, targeted approach. This may directly impact management and can prove helpful when considering future complaints of the patient."

    "title": "Selecting patients with sickle cell disease for gene addition or gene editing-based therapeutic approaches: Report on behalf of a joint EHA Specialized Working Group and EBMT Hemoglobinopathies Working Party consensus conference.",
    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) remains associated with reduced life expectancy and poor quality of life despite improvements observed in the last decades mostly related to comprehensive care, use of hydroxycarbamide, screening to identify patients at risk of strokes, and implementation of safe transfusion protocols. The course of the disease is highly variable, making it difficult to predict severity and response to therapy. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation potentially provides a cure with a relatively low rate of complications, but few patients have an HLA-identical sibling. The hopes of patients and healthcare providers have been raised after the initial excellent results of gene therapy studies. However, there is a strong contrast between the high expectations of families and patients and the limited availability of the product, which is technically complex and very expensive. In light of this consideration and of the limited data available on the long-term efficacy and toxicity of different gene therapy approaches, the European Hematology Association Red Cell & Iron Specialized Working Group (EHA SWG) and the hemoglobinopathy working part of the European Blood & Marrow Transplant (EBMT) Group have prioritized the development of recommendations for selection of patients with SCD who are good candidates for gene therapy. The decision-making algorithm was developed by a panel of experts in hemoglobinopathies and/or transplantation chosen by EHA SWG and EBMT, to discuss the selection of SCD patients for gene therapy and draw notes on the related clinical problems."

    "abstract": "Infectious diseases are frequent and sometimes deadly in sickle cell disease (SCD) patients. Some of these infectious diseases could be avoided through immunisation, but an immunisation schedule for children with SCD is not available in Gabon. This study looked into the determinants of immunisation in children with SCD in Libreville. This work was performed in five healthcare facilities in Libreville. A cross-sectional study on knowledge, attitudes, and practices was conducted from February 2019 to September 2019 in Libreville healthcare facilities, targeting children under 18 years with SCD. A total of 172 parents of children with SCD participated. The average age of children was 7.1 ± 4.2 years, with a sex ratio of 1:36. Immunisation status was considered complete for 87.9% (95% CI = 79.8-93.1) according to the Expanded Programme of Immunisation (EPI) schedule. Only 49 (28.5%) parents understood SCD complications, and 39 (22.7%) knew how to prevent them. Immunisation coverage was better for children near public health centres (<i>p</i> = 0.008). For non-EPI vaccines, coverage improved for children of married parents (<i>p</i> = 0.041) and those seen by paediatricians in private facilities (<i>p</i> = 0.046). Multivariate analysis indicated that marital status, a lack of knowledge, facility access, and high vaccine costs predicted immunisation coverage. Immunisation coverage of children with SCD was better than the national immunisation coverage in Gabon. This study unravels the need for Gabon to improve its immunisation programmes in public healthcare facilities."

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a single-gene disorder caused by a point mutation of the β-globin gene, resulting in hemolytic anemia, acute pain, multiorgan damage, and early mortality. Hydroxyurea is a first-line drug therapy that switches sickle-globin to non-pathogenic γ-globin; however, it requires lifelong oral administration. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation allows for a one-time cure for SCD, albeit with histocompatibility limitations. Therefore, autologous HSC gene therapy was developed to cure SCD in a single treatment, without HSC donors. Current HSC gene therapy is based on the ex vivo culture of patients' HSCs with lentiviral gene addition and gene editing, followed by autologous transplantation back to the patient. However, the complexity of the treatment process and high costs hinder the universal application of ex vivo gene therapy. Therefore, the development of in vivo HSC gene therapy, where gene therapy tools are directly administered to patients, is desirable to provide a more accessible, cost-effective solution that can cure SCD worldwide. In this review, we discuss current treatments, including drug therapies, HSC transplantation, and ex vivo gene therapy; the development of gene therapy tools; and progress toward curative in vivo gene therapy in SCD."

This study aims to investigate orofacial radiographic features in patients with SCD and to compare these findings with those in matched healthy controls. A total of 52 patients with SCD were included, along with 52 healthy individuals in an age- and sex-matched control group. The demographic data and medical histories of the participants were recorded. Panoramic, cephalometric, periapical, and bitewing radiographs were obtained by certified dental practitioners. Radiographic features were identified and compared between the study and control groups as well as across SCD subtypes. These features were then correlated with the systemic complications reported by the patients. Data were analyzed using chi-square and Fisher exact tests (P < 0.05). Patients with SCD exhibited generalized osteopenia, enlarged medullary spaces, thinning/scalloping of the inferior border of the mandible, and radiopaque lesions significantly more frequently than did individuals in the control group. No statistically significant differences were found among the SCD subtypes, and there were no significant correlations between radiographic features and disease complications. Identification of these radiographic indicators and greater knowledge of their pathogenesis and association with systemic complications will enhance the role of dentists in the comprehensive medical care of patients with SCD."

In this prospective, open-label, uncontrolled pilot study, ten SCD patients with 17 chronic leg ulcers received PDT and PBM treatments. Ulcer severity, pain levels, and microbiome changes were monitored, and clinical data were analyzed using appropriate statistical methods. Among the treated ulcers, 64.7 % (11 out of 17) showed significant healing, with 9 ulcers achieving complete closure. The average reduction in ulcer size was significant, with a median healing time of 123 days. Pain levels decreased significantly in 82.3 % of treated ulcers (p < 0.001), and a 75.4 % reduction in bacterial load was observed, alongside increased microbiome diversity (p < 0.05). Elevated levels of IL-6 and PSGL-1 were associated with non-healing ulcers, indicating their potential as prognostic biomarkers. The combined PDT and PBM therapy proved to be effective and safe for SCLUs, offering significant improvements in healing and pain reduction. These findings suggest that integrating PDT and PBM into standard care protocols could enhance the management of SCLUs."

All previous trials for priapism prevention have failed to demonstrate clear efficacy. We conducted a randomized, controlled, double-blind phase 2 feasibility trial comparing fixed moderate-dose hydroxyurea plus placebo (usual care arm) versus fixed moderate-dose hydroxyurea plus tadalafil (experimental arm) in 64 men (18- 40 years) with at least three episodes of SCA-related priapism in the past 12 months. Priapism data were obtained via daily text messages to the participants. The trial's primary outcome measures were 100% recruitment, 98.4% retention, and 93.5% adherence rates. Over a median of 10 months (IQR: 3-12), 2.5 and 3.02 priapism events per participant-month were recorded in the usual care and the experimental arms, with an incidence rate ratio of 0.8; 95% CI: 0.3 -1.9; p= 0.654. Serious adverse events (p=0.999) and hospitalizations (p=0.289) were similar in both arms. Sperm concentration, motility, and normal morphology significantly decreased on hydroxyurea therapy but recovered to pre-hydroxyurea levels three months after therapy cessation. Post-hoc, single-arm, pre- and post-analysis comparing the priapism rate in the treatment phase to pre-randomization showed a 58.3% priapism incidence rate reduction in the usual care arm (5.9 to 2.5 events per month; difference 3.4, 95% CI: 1.1 - 5.8; p=0.005]) and 66.3% priapism reduction in the experimental arm (8.9 to 3.02 events per month; difference 5.9; 95% CI: 3.4 - 8.5; p<0.001]).

Patients with both sickle cell disease and ESKD are at a greater risk of adverse events including mortality; while these patients can be managed with hemodialysis (HD), the use of nocturnal HD in sickle cell disease has not been previously described. Here, we report a patient with sickle cell disease and ESKD who transitioned from conventional HD to nocturnal home HD. Following the initiation of extended HD, we observed a significant improvement in her blood pressure (BP) parameters, serum potassium levels, and volume status. We describe the importance of nitric oxide (NO) in maintaining normal endothelial function, and how NO bioavailability is disrupted in both the sickle cell disease and ESKD populations. We speculated that our patient had significant vasoconstriction secondary to NO depletion causing uncontrolled hypertension and intravascular hemolysis (leading to recurrent hyperkalemia), and theorized that extended HD could have enhanced the bioavailability of NO, restoring the vasodilatory capability of her endothelium. Having a dialysis modality that counters the negative pathophysiologic endothelial changes in sickle cell disease and ESKD could result in fewer complications in this vulnerable population."

In France, the referral center for rare gynecological diseases specializes in four major types of conditions, namely, uterovaginal malformations, hereditary hemorrhagic diseases, rare benign breast diseases, and gynecological repercussions of rare chronic diseases. To describe consecutive patients who had a first visit in 2018-2023 at the referral center for rare gynecological diseases at the Necker Pediatric University Hospital in Paris, France, and who were diagnosed with a condition in any of the four categories listed above. For this single-center retrospective observational cohort study, data from the referral-center database were collected and reviewed. These data included year of birth, age at and reason for first gynecology visit, and rare chronic disease and referring rare-disease center for patients seen for gynecological repercussions of rare chronic diseases. The 704 included patients had a median age of 15.2 years (interquartile range 3.8) at the first visit. Among them, 100 (14.2%) had uterovaginal malformations, 32 (4.6%) hereditary hemorrhagic diseases, 17 (2.4%) rare benign breast diseases, and 555 (78.8%) gynecological repercussions of rare chronic diseases. The leading reasons for the visit were dysmenorrhea (15.6%), menorrhagia (15.5%), uterovaginal malformations (15.2%), and irregular periods (14.9%). Repercussions of rare chronic diseases managed at rare-disease referral centers were by far the leading reason for seeking gynecological expertise in rare diseases. In this complex situation, the underlying disease and its treatments interact with the gynecological manifestations and their treatment, requiring close collaboration among all specialists caring for each patient."

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease and β-thalassemia are important health problems in Middle Eastern countries. Transfusion is the cornerstone of the management in these disorders, and red blood cell alloimmunization is among the well-recognized adverse effects associated with it. We reviewed the literature on published studies on alloimmunization prevalence, its associated risk factors, and transfusion policies employed in these countries. Our review included 39 studies on thalassemia (including 9005 patients), and 19 on sickle cell disease (including 3867 patients). The mean alloimmunization prevalence rate in thalassemia was 13.0% (95% CI: 10.0-15.0%), while that in sickle cell disease was 14.0% (95% CI: 10.0 - 19.0%). The distribution of the prevalence rates showed considerable heterogeneity in both diseases. The most frequent alloantibodies detected were anti-K (25.9%), Anti-E (21.8%), and Anti-D (9.2%), with Rhesus and K antibodies comprising 74.2% of all antibodies detected. Some risk factors were significant in several studies, including older age, female sex, older age at first transfusion, number of transfused units, and splenectomy. The prevalence of alloimmunization was significantly higher in retrospective studies compared to cross-sectional ones, in both thalassemia and sickle cell disease (<i>P</i> = 0.04 in each). This review reaffirmed the need to provide ABO+Rhesus + K matched blood to hemoglobinopathy patients in the Middle East, and the need for more research on Rhesus variants in this part of the world."

    "abstract": "Despite favorable hemodynamic and neurohormonal effects, endothelin receptor antagonists have not improved outcomes in patients with heart failure (HF), possibly because they cause fluid retention. In this randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial (SERENADE [Macitentan in Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction and Pulmonary Vascular Disease]), we evaluated the effects of an endothelin receptor antagonist, macitentan, in patients with HF, left ventricular ejection fraction ≥40%, and pulmonary vascular disease. After a 4-week placebo run-in (to ensure clinical stability), followed by a 5-week single-blind macitentan run-in, patients who did not exhibit fluid retention were randomized to macitentan or placebo. The primary end point was change in NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide; baseline to 24 weeks); secondary end points included change in KCCQ (Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire) clinical summary score (baseline to 24 weeks) and time to worsening HF by 52 weeks. Of 230 patients enrolled, 28 were excluded during the placebo run-in, 60 excluded during the macitentan run-in, and 142 were randomized. Macitentan had no effect on change in NT-proBNP (geometric mean ratio [macitentan/placebo], 1.02 [90% CI, 0.88-1.19]; <i>P</i>=0.79) or on secondary end points (placebo-corrected change in KCCQ clinical summary score, -3.5 [90% CI, -8.2 to +1.2]; <i>P</i>=0.22).

However, there is a scarcity of data regarding the prevalence of RBC alloimmunization in such patients in Saudi Arabia. To address this gap, a comprehensive meta-analysis was undertaken to ascertain the rate of RBC alloimmunization in SCD and thalassemia patients who receive regular transfusions in Saudi Arabia. A systematic search and subsequent meta-analysis, following PRISMA guidelines, were carried out. We meticulously combed through six prominent scientific databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, SCOPUS, EMBASE, MEDLINE, and Google Scholar, up to July 20, 2023, to identify pertinent English-language articles. Data were meticulously extracted from the selected studies. The meta-analysis adopted a random-effects model and included subgroup analyses to delineate the RBC alloimmunization rates specifically for SCD and thalassemia patients receiving regular transfusions. Heterogeneity was assessed through Cochran's Q and I2 tests. The study protocol was registered under PROSPERO, with the code CRD42023440761. Our comprehensive search yielded a total of 983 articles, with 12 meeting the criteria for the final analysis, encompassing a total of 1,811 SCD and thalassemia patients. The collective RBC alloimmunization rate across all the eligible articles for patients with SCD and thalassemia who received regular transfusions in Saudi Arabia was determined to be 18.2%. Subgroup analysis, comprising nine articles, indicated that the RBC alloimmunization rate among SCD patients was 18.6%, while analysis of six articles revealed that the rate among thalassemia patients stood at 19.5%. This meta-analysis underscores that the RBC alloimmunization rate in SCD and thalassemia patients who regularly receive transfusions in Saudi Arabia stands at 18.2%. Considering these findings, it is essential to prioritize extended phenotyping prior to transfusion to significantly reduce the risk of RBC alloimmunization."

Pneumococcal immunization associated with antibiotic prophylaxis reduced the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease in these patients. However, the risk remains higher than in the general population. Our main objective was to describe the features of pneumococcal meningitis and estimate the case-fatality rate in children with SCD. The secondary objective was to assess serotype distribution and resistance patterns and the proportion of cases related to vaccine failure. This nationwide multicenter observational study was conducted in France between 2001 and 2021. All cases of pneumococcal meningitis in children with SCD < 18 years old from the French National Registry of Pediatric Pneumococcal Meningitis were included. Of 2145 pneumococcal meningitis, 25 cases (1.2%, 95% CI: 0.8-1.7) occurred in children with SCD [mean age = 4.6 years (±4)], with a high case-fatality rate (28%, n = 7, 95% CI: 10.4-45.6). Nonvaccine serotypes were predominant (n = 15, 65%, 95% CI: 45.8-84.7) over vaccine serotypes (n = 8, 35%, 95% CI: 15.3-54.3). One case of vaccine failure (4%, n = 1/23) and 2 breakthrough cases (n = 2/23, 9%) were observed. Penicillin-non-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae strains were identified in 39% (n = 7). The occurrence of pneumococcal meningitis in children with SCD during the pneumococcal conjugate vaccines era was associated with a high case-fatality rate and a predominance of nonvaccine serotypes. The implementation of new serotype-expanded PCV may have a potentially positive impact on this vulnerable population."

With the opioid epidemic raising concerns about opioid overdose, this study examines in-hospital outcomes among SCD and non-SCD patients hospitalized for opioid overdose. Using the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) from 2016 to 2021, we analyzed 479,175 opioid overdose hospitalizations, including 1,315 (0.3%) with a concomitant diagnosis of SCD. Propensity score matching was used to balance demographics, comorbidities, and hospital characteristics. SCD patients were younger (45.3% aged 30-49 vs. 33.1%, p < 0.001), predominantly of African descent (92.1% vs. 14.1%, p < 0.001), and more often from lower-income households (58.4% vs. 35.2%, p < 0.001).

No significant differences in in-hospital mortality were observed (aOR: 0.89, 95% CI: 0.7-1.1, p = 0.34). These findings emphasize the need for a nuanced approach to managing SCD patients during opioid overdose hospitalizations, focusing on mitigating complications, addressing prolonged hospital stays and higher costs, and reducing healthcare disparities through tailored strategies informed by the unique needs of this population."

Data from 108 children who completed the feasibility trial for managing severe acute malnutrition in older children with SCA in Nigeria were analyzed. Children aged 5-12 years old with severe acute malnutrition (BMI z-score of <-3.0) were randomly allocated to receive either supplemental ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF) alone or RUTF with moderate-dose hydroxyurea (20 mg/kg/day). Caregivers completed the United States Household Food Security Survey Module to measure food security. We focused on the childhood section for its accuracy in assessing food security in older children. Higher scores (0-8) indicate greater food insecurity. We constructed multivariable linear regression models to estimate the association between childhood food insecurity and BMI z-scores at baseline and endpoint. Most participants were food insecure, with 55% (n = 59) and 34% (n = 37) having low and very low food security, respectively. Higher scores on the continuous food security measure, indicating lower food security, were associated with lower BMI z-scores at both study entry (β = -0.05, p = 0.047) and after malnutrition treatment (β = -0.07, p = 0.016). Among severely malnourished children with SCA, lower childhood food security scores are associated with an adverse treatment response, reflected by a lower BMI z-score at the trial's end.

Twenty-eight children between the ages of 6 and 17 years were recruited for the study including children with SCD and age- and sex-matched controls. Posturography measures included Limits of Stability (LOS) and Modified Clinical Test of Sensory Interaction in Balance (mCTSIB) testing and balance was measured using the Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency, 2nd Edition (BOT-2). There were no between-group differences in posturography measures. Children with SCD had significantly poorer BOT-2 balance performance as compared to age- and sex-matched controls (<i>p</i> < 0.001). This sample of children with SCD does not demonstrate impairments in posturography as measured by limits of stability and sensory integration despite having significantly impaired balance compared to peers.

Pain and quality of life (QoL) were assessed through patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). Twenty-three sICPs, including arginase-1, BTLA, CD27, CD28, CD47, CD80, CD96, CD134, CD137, CD152, GITR, HVEM, IDO, LAG-3, MICA, MICB, Nectin-2, PD-1, Siglec-7, Siglec-9, TIM-3, TIMD-4, and VISTA, were significantly elevated in SCD patients compared to HCs. These sICPs correlated with multiple proinflammatory mediators (e.g., IL-18), autoantibodies (e.g., MPO), and immune cell activation markers (e.g., CD38/HLA-DR on CD8 T cells). Notably, CD28, CD152, HVEM, and VISTA were strongly associated with systemic inflammation and immune cell activation, while BTLA, LAG-3, PD-1, and CD80 correlated with pain and anxiety scores and QoL. This study highlights complex interactions between sICPs, immune activation, inflammation, and clinical outcomes in SCD, underscoring their potential as biomarkers or therapeutic targets to alleviate inflammation and improve QoL in this challenging clinical population."

CF is an autosomal recessive multisystemic disease with pathophysiology involving deleterious mutations in the transmembrane regulatory gene that encodes a protein that regulates the activity of chloride and sodium channels in the cell surface epithelium. NS is crucial for early diagnosis and management, which ensures a better quality of life. To report a case of the coexistence of sickle cell anemia (SCA) and CF and perform an integrative literature review. This is an observational study and a review of the literature focusing on two rare genetic pathologies identified simultaneously in NS from the perspective of a clinical case. The authors identified only 5 cases of SCA associated with CF. No clinical trials or review articles were identified considering the rarity of the coexistence of these two pathologies. Herein, the authors reported the case of a girl who after undergoing NS on day 8 of life was diagnosed with SCA with an alteration in the dosage of immunoreactive trypsin. The diagnosis of CF was confirmed by the Coulometry Sweat Test. The rarity of the co-occurrence of these two severe genetic pathologies (CF and SCA) is a challenge for medical science. This study adds to the few case reports present in the literature that highlight the identification of two severe diseases <i>via</i> NS."

    "abstract": "This study aimed to examine the demographic characteristics of informal caregivers of pediatric patients with sickle cell disease. The background characteristics of both caregivers and care recipients were analyzed, and the informal care situation was examined. Additionally, this study aimed to quantify the economic impact of care. This cross-sectional study was conducted in the eastern region of Saudi Arabia, involving a sample of 27 caregivers of pediatric patients diagnosed with sickle cell disease. The survey instruments comprised the iMAT Valuation of Informal Care Questionnaire (IVICQ) to evaluate informal care costs, along with the Katz Index of Independence in activities of daily living (ADL) to assess the functional abilities of the care recipients. Most participants were female caregivers (81.5%) and married (74.1%). The average age of the caregiver members was 38.0 years. Those in need of care, predominantly daughters or sons (85.2%), had a positive health outlook (average score: 6.85) and moderate independence (average ADL score: 4.70). The CarerQol-7D indicated variable perceived quality of life, with fulfillment in caregiving tasks (74.1%) and minimal relationship problems (74.1%). Economically, caregivers invest 245 h per week, which costs SAR 13,805 (3681 USD). The total opportunity cost was SAR 806 (215 USD) per caregiver per week. This study examined caregiver dynamics in pediatric patients with sickle cell disease. Female, predominantly married caregivers, showed a long-term commitment. Despite these challenges, the caregivers demonstrated confidence in the importance of their roles. This study highlights the need for targeted support to improve caregivers' well-being."

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) and transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia (TDT) are inherited blood disorders caused by pathogenic variants of the β-globin gene. Historically, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) from human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched donors has been the only curative option. However, as most patients with SCD or TDT lack HLA-matched donors, autologous or patient-derived HSCT can provide an alternative, transformative option. Gene therapy-based autologous HSCT for the treatment of SCD and TDT entails a complex patient journey and requires the careful implementation of numerous policies and procedures. As gene therapies for these diseases are now commercially available, there is great value in institutions with developed and implemented approaches sharing their best practices. Here, we describe standardized approaches and best practices for the optimized implementation of gene therapies based on our experience in administering this novel class of medicines."

    "title": "A critique review of fetal hemoglobin modulators through targeting epigenetic regulators for the treatment of sickle cell disease.",
    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is one of the most prevalent hereditary blood disorders characterized by aberrant hemoglobin synthesis that causes red blood cells (RBCs) to sickle and result in vaso-occlusion. The complex pathophysiological mechanisms that underlie SCD are explored in this study, including hemoglobin polymerization, the formation of fetal hemoglobin (HbF), and hemoglobin switching regulation. Notably, pharmaceutical approaches like hydroxyurea, l-glutamine, voxelotor, and crizanlizumab, in addition to therapeutic techniques like gene therapies like Casgevy and Lyfgenia, signify noteworthy advancements in the management of issues connected to SCD. Furthermore, the deciphering of the molecular mechanisms that dictate hemoglobin switching has revealed several potentially therapeutic targets, including key transcriptional repressors such as β-cell lymphoma/leukemia 11A (BCL11A), Zinc finger and BTB domain-containing 7A (ZBTB7A), Nuclear Factor IX (NFIX), and Nuclear Factor IA (NFIA), which play crucial roles in γ-globin silencing. Additionally, transcriptional activators such as Nuclear Factor Y (NF-Y), and Hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α) have emerged as promising regulators that can disrupt repression and enhance HbF synthesis. Other epigenetic regulators, such as lysine-specific histone demethylase 1 (LSD1), euchromatic histone methyltransferases 1/2 (EHMT1/2), histone deacetylases (HDACs), DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), and protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs). It has been demonstrated that inhibiting these targets can prevent the silencing of the gene encoding for the formation of γ-chains and, in turn, increase the synthesis of HbF, providing a possible treatment option for SCD symptoms. These approaches could pave the way for innovative, mechanism-driven therapies that address the unmet medical needs of SCD patients."

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a debilitating hereditary medical condition associated with pain, stigma, morbidity, and early death. To reduce the prevalence and improve the quality of life of persons with SCD, improved knowledge, practices and reduced stigma are key for Uganda since improved medical breakthroughs in SCD diagnosis, care, and management are expensive in Uganda. However, there is limited research on knowledge, attitudes, and practice (KAP) towards SCD, therefore this study presents the levels and determinants of SCD KAP in Alebtong district, Lango region in Northern Uganda. Data was obtained from 500 respondents aged 18 years and above in three sub-counties in Alebtong district. Multinomial logistic regression was used to identify key determinants of one's knowledge and attitudes toward SCD. Binary logistic regression model was used to find the key determinants of SCD practices in Alebtong district. More than half of the respondents had good knowledge of SCD (60.8%) and good attitudes (87.0%). However, a very small percentage had ever tested for SCD (4.4%). The highest proportion of the respondents had a fair knowledge of SCD (49.6%) and good attitudes (82%). However, a very small percentage had ever tested for SCD (4.4%). Factors significantly associated with knowledge of SCD were residence, the commonest health information channel, and listening to the radio. Urban residents and those who mostly received their health information from community announcers were less likely to have a fair knowledge of SCD. Still, urban residents, those who mostly received their health information from community announcers, and those who never listened to the radio at all were less likely to have good knowledge of SCD. Respondents who listened to the radio less than once a week and those who never listened to the radio at all were less likely to have good attitudes toward persons with SCD. Respondents who completed primary education were more likely to test for SCD (aOR = 8.2, p = 0.05, 95%CI = 1.01-66.4). Respondents had relatively high levels of good knowledge and attitudes towards SCD, but few had tested for SCD. This was significantly associated with access to information either through school, radio, or health providers. Communities, researchers, healthcare programmers, and policymakers should prioritize health information availability through different media to increase knowledge, attitudes, and practice toward SCD."

ERCs, often aggregate labels encompassing diverse individuals which raises questions about their relevance as confounders. Given SCD's racialization as a \"Black\" disease, understanding ERC utilization is crucial. This study analyzed 1,105 SCD studies published globally. Data were collected on whether ERC adjustment was employed, regional variations in ERC-adjustment rates, labels used for ERCs, rationales provided for ERC matching, and methods used for ERC determination. 28% of the studies utilized ERC adjustment, with significant regional disparities (p < 0.001). Notably, Western studies showed higher rates of ERC adjustment compared to other regions. However, crucial details such as ERC labels and methodology were frequently missing. Commonly used labels included \"African\" or \"Black.\" Only 7% of studies provided explicit rationales for ERC matching, and 70% did not specify the method used for ERC determination. The findings underscore the need to adhere to guidelines on ERC operationalization in biomedicine. The lack of standardized practices raises concerns about potential biases and misinterpretations in research outcomes. Adhering to clear guidelines can mitigate the risk of perpetuating racial stereotypes and inequalities while ensuring research integrity."

    "title": "Newborn Screening for Sickle Cell Disease and Thalassemia.",
    "abstract": "Hemoglobin disorders are a considerable public health issue with more than 500 000 affected infants born annually worldwide. First introduced in the 1970s, newborn screening (NBS) for sickle cell disease (SCD) was included in the Recommended Uniform Screening Panel (RUSP) in 2006, a successful public health promotion and prevention practice that has led to improved childhood survival. Although SCD is the primary target, the screening process also detects many other hemoglobinopathies. NBS programs, administered by individual states, vary in their practices for hemoglobinopathy screening, creating health inequities and compromising public health efforts. There is a lack of uniformity in the choice of primary screening test, reporting, and follow-up of abnormal results, exacerbated by inconsistent access to genetic confirmation. Consequently, newborns diagnosed through protein-based screening alone may have diverse genotypes that alter the clinical expression of hemoglobinopathies. This Special Communication considers how the universal adoption of molecular testing for hemoglobinopathy newborn screening can overcome these current shortcomings. Simultaneously, the considerable challenges of primary screening with molecular methods and how these can be overcome are evaluated. Screening with targeted genetic testing of the hemoglobin genes (HbA1, HBA2, HBB) is especially well suited to hemoglobinopathies because there exists an extensive database of variants for the prediction of pathogenicity, averting the need for secondary or multiple testing. Importantly, it would eliminate the health disparities created by location and health insurance on the access to confirmatory testing and facilitate timely referral for definitive care. Standardization of the screening platform with diagnostic specificity has vast implications for public health surveillance and resource allocation. The adoption of molecular testing requires bringing new technology online, training and changes to workflow, potentially increased cost, and concerns for genetic data protection. Some of these barriers can be overcome using high-throughput methods with the potential to multiplex with other disease conditions that use genetic testing for primary screening through the consolidation of platforms. The time has come for a paradigm shift in newborn screening for hemoglobinopathies through the adoption of universal molecular genetic testing."

    "abstract": "Guidelines recommend that hydroxyurea be offered to children with sickle cell disease (SCD) as early as 9 months of age using shared decision-making. To help clinicians implement shared decision-making with parents, we developed the Hydroxyurea Shared Decision-Making (H-SDM) toolkit. We evaluated its effectiveness on parent decisional uncertainty, perceptions of shared decision-making, hydroxyurea knowledge, and the likelihood of being offered and prescribed hydroxyurea. Sites began in the usual care condition (clinician pocket guide) before crossing over to the H-SDM toolkit condition between 2018 and 2022. Caregivers of children with SCD (birth to 5 years) eligible for hydroxyurea completed assessments at baseline, immediately after discussing hydroxyurea with their clinician, and 3-7 months later. Participants included 176 caregivers (93.2% female, 89% Black); most toolkit participants were enrolled during the pandemic (n = 81). There were no statistically significant differences between conditions on parent decisional uncertainty, perceptions of shared decision-making, or hydroxyurea knowledge (p-values >0.05). However, there was a clinically important difference in certainty, with higher decisional uncertainty in the usual care group. A greater proportion of participants enrolled during usual care were offered (80.7%) and prescribed hydroxyurea (48.2%), compared to 58.7% offered and 39.7% prescribed during the toolkit condition (p-values ≤0.01). Findings suggest the toolkit may help parents feel more confident in deciding about hydroxyurea. Given the significant impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on study implementation, the impact on hydroxyurea uptake requires additional exploration. Ultimately, the H-SDM toolkit may be most beneficial for clinics that do not routinely use a shared decision-making process for those considering hydroxyurea."

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is prevalent in Sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, and parts of India, where it is often complicated by iron deficiency anemia (IDA). Untreated IDA exacerbates SCD symptoms, reducing quality of life (QOL) and increasing morbidity and mortality. Diagnosis typically depends on ferritin levels, which can be unreliable due to inflammation associated with SCD's altered red cell morphology and chronic hemolysis. This systematic review and meta-analysis explores the interplay between IDA and SCD, focusing on diagnostic criteria for effective management. We conducted a thorough search of PubMed and EMBASE, leading to the selection of 14 studies following PRISMA guidelines. The review protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42023462914). Data extraction, quality assessments, and heterogeneity checks were rigorously performed. Out of 3188 articles, 14 studies met the inclusion criteria, covering 763 SCD cases with 118 instances of IDA. The meta-analysis found an IDA prevalence of 6% (95% CI: 1%-20%) among SCD patients, with high heterogeneity (I 2 = 88.8%). Sensitivity analysis adjusted for publication bias indicated an 8% prevalence (95% CI: 4%-19%) with reduced heterogeneity (I 2 = 19.5%). Subgroup analysis revealed a lower prevalence of IDA in pregnant women (0.01%; 95% CI: 0.00%-0.92%) compared to non-pregnant individuals (7%; 95% CI: 2%-22%). The study highlights significant regional variability in IDA prevalence among SCD patients, emphasizing the importance of early diagnosis and targeted management to improve patient outcomes and QOL."

We examined the prevalence of sleep-associated hypoxemia (≥5 minutes at SpO<sub>2</sub> ≤88%) or nocturnal Hb desaturation (NHD) in chronically transfused adults with SCD. Of 41 identified participants, 15 (36.6%) had tested positive for NHD at some point prior to enrollment. The median duration of desaturation (SpO<sub>2</sub> ≤88%) in those that tested positive was 88.3 minutes (IQR 27.9-226.0 minutes). Participants with and without NHD were compared using non-parametric statistical tests. Compared to participants without NHD, those with NHD had higher absolute reticulocyte counts (<i>P</i> = .018) and white blood counts (<i>P</i> = .05) and tended to be older. They had more anemia (<i>P</i> = .11) and higher lactate dehydrogenase levels (<i>P</i> = .072). Older age at initiation of chronic red blood cell transfusions associated the strongest with a longer duration of NHD (ρ = 0.4253, <i>P</i> = .0067), while prior history of cerebrovascular events associated with a shorter duration of NHD (<i>P</i> = .0315). Our results demonstrate that NHD is common in adults being treated with red blood cell exchange for high-risk SCD and associates with laboratory evidence of increased disease activity. Increased awareness of this complication and appropriate screening may provide an additional simple, low-cost, and physiologically relevant treatment intervention, that is oxygen therapy."

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a hereditary blood disorder resulting from the production of distorted hemoglobin molecules that cause red blood cells to adopt a sickle or crescent-like shape. This disease affects millions of people, particularly those of African, Mediterranean, Middle Eastern, or South Asian descent. In recent years, however, advancements in the CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing systems have surged. CRISPR stands for clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats, referring to a specific organization of short, partially repeated DNA sequences in prokaryotic genomes. The CRISPR-Cas9 technique is based on the type II CRISPR system of bacteria and involves the Cas9 nuclease, which is targeted to a particular genome section with the help of single-guide RNA. Initially used for random mutations and small sequence alterations, genome editing methods have advanced to achieve large-scale DNA segment manipulation. The BE and PE-- type CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing variants provide new therapeutic options for genetic disorders, improving patients' prognosis. Curative gene editing using CRISPR-Cas9 technology to correct HBB gene mutations that cause SCD represents a revolutionary therapeutic development. These advances bring new hope to patients with previously untreatable diseases, potentially offering a future where genetic disorders can be addressed at their roots. A major objective of CRISPR technology is to enhance its precision and speed, both critical for effective gene editing. This review focuses on molecular mechanisms of CRISPR-Cas9 technology, CRISPR-- Cas9-based approaches for HBB gene modification, clinical trials, patients with sickle cell disease, and advances in CRISPR technology for sickle cell disease."

    "abstract": "While asthma is a known risk factor for Acute Chest Syndrome (ACS) and may increase overall mortality in SCD patients, this study specifically focuses on the rate of inpatient mortality, hospital stay, and costs in SCD patients who develop ACS. Our study was conducted using a retrospective cohort from the National Inpatient Sample (NIS), spanning 5 years from 2016 to 2020. Patients were carefully divided into two cohorts for comparison: those admitted with ACS and a history of asthma and those with ACS without a history of asthma. The primary endpoint was all-cause inpatient mortality, and we built a robust multivariate regression model adjusting for confounders. We also thoroughly examined secondary endpoints, including a comparison of length of stay (LOS), hospital, transfusion rates, mechanical ventilation (MV) rates, Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy (CRRT), and rates of hemodialysis (HD) for acute kidney injury (AKI). Our analysis of LOS and total cost was conducted using a multivariate linear regression model adjusted for confounders, ensuring the thoroughness and validity of our results. Additionally, genotypes, demographics, and common comorbidities were described. Categorical variables required Chi-square (X2), and continuous variables required a Student t-test for hypothesis testing. A two-tailed P-value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. We utilized the National Inpatient Database (NIS). A total of 26,280 hospitalizations met the inclusion criteria:5,685 had ACS with a history of asthma, and 20,622 without ACS. Patients with ACS and Asthma were younger (mean age, 28 years vs. 32 years; p < 0.001), and females represented a higher proportion (53.03% vs. 47.56%; p = 0.940). Patients admitted with ACS and Asthma did not have higher odds of dying than those admitted with ACS without asthma (p = 0.176). The Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) was the only predictor of mortality. (aOR 1.52; p < 0.001). ACS with Asthma was a predictive factor for LOS (coefficient -0.65; p = 0.009). Conversely, female patients had a higher likelihood of experiencing a more extended hospital stay (coefficient, 0.61; p = 0.001). Additionally, ACS with Asthma significantly affected the total cost (coefficient: -15,201; p < 0.001), resulting in a lower cost than ACS patients without asthma. Finally, patients with ACS with Asthma did not have higher rates of transfusions, MV, CRRT, or HD due to AKI than those without asthma. Asthma did not increase the risk of in-hospital mortality in this large retrospective cohort study of patients admitted for Acute Chest Syndrome (ACS). While patients with ACS and a history of asthma were younger and had a lower total cost of care, their length of stay was shorter, and they did not experience higher rates of transfusion, mechanical ventilation, or acute kidney injury requiring dialysis. The primary predictor of mortality was the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), highlighting the importance of overall comorbidity burden. These findings suggest that although asthma is a known risk factor for ACS, it does not independently worsen patient outcomes or survival, underscoring the need for a broader focus on managing comorbid conditions in these patients."

Ghana, a country with a significant SCD burden, lacks population haplotype frequency data, hindering anthropological, genetic, and clinical understanding and management of the disease. A prospective sample of 191 SCD patients (sickle cell anemia; homozygous HbSS) was recruited at the Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital, Accra. Identification of β<sup>S</sup> gene haplotypes was performed using the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) technique. Hematological tests were performed using routine laboratory procedures. Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA with Dunn post-hoc was used to compare the hematological parameters. Multinomial probability models were used to compare the frequencies of the observed haplotypes with those reported in other African countries. The Atypical haplotype was disproportionately prevalent (58%), followed by the Bantu/CAR (20%) and Benin (10%) haplotypes. Significant differences were observed between the haplotypes in lymphocyte count, platelet count, sodium and potassium levels (<i>P</i> < 0.001). In addition, disease severity varied significantly between haplotypes (<i>P</i> = 0.010), with notable differences between the Atypical and Bantu/CAR haplotypes (<i>P</i><sub>FDR</sub> = 0.020). Multinomial probability testing revealed a substantial deviation from the expected haplotype distribution, highlighting significant differences in haplotype frequencies between Ghana and other African countries. The Wright-Fisher model showed that the variation in Arab-Indian haplotype frequency reached zero by the 100<sup>th</sup> generation. Our findings highlight the need to study haplotype composition in Ghana to identify population-specific risk factors and tailor public health interventions to better manage patient needs."

    "abstract": "Background and objective The presence of Weiss ring is classically used to aid in the diagnosis of posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) but may at times be challenging to visualize under slit-lamp biomicroscopy. The anterior hyaloid separation sign (AHSS) is a previously undescribed sign that is seen among patients with PVD as a \"veil of vitreous\" in the anterior vitreous cavity. AHSS is easier to visualize than Weiss ring and may prove useful in settings where Weiss ring detection is not feasible. Methods This study analyzed the connection between the presence of AHSS among the PVD population. A retrospective chart review of patients with established PVD (n=214) enrolled at Mason Eye Clinic (Columbia, Missouri, United States) between February 1, 2023, and October 1, 2023, was performed. All patients with a confirmed diagnosis of PVD were stratified as exhibiting AHSS or not exhibiting AHSS. Data including patient demographics, lens status, and ocular comorbidities were collected. Results The mean age was 70.3 years, 72% were females, and 93.9% were Caucasians. Ocular comorbidities include epiretinal membrane (17.8%), retinal tear (9.8%), proliferative diabetic retinopathy (5.1%), retinal vein occlusion (4.7%), uveitis (4.7%), rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (4.2%), and sickle cell disease (1%). Around 56.2% of cases were newly diagnosed PVD, while 43.8% were long-standing PVD. Among all PVD cases (n=214), 89.7% (n=192) presented with AHSS, whereas 10.3% (n=22) did not present with AHSS. The chi-squared goodness-of-fit test compared this study's AHSS prevalence in PVD with the general PVD population. Analysis revealed a significant prevalence between the presence and absence of AHSS in PVD patients at 84% (p=0.02). Conclusion The presence of AHSS has a high prevalence among patients with PVD and holds value in aiding the diagnosis and confirmation of PVD."

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease encompasses a variety of inherited red blood cell (RBC) disorders characterized by abnormal thrombosis, microvascular occlusion, end-organ ischemia, and early mortality. Understanding how sickle RBCs drive abnormal blood flow and stress on the endothelial wall is essential to predict and prevent blockages in blood circulation. While there are studies comparing blood flow velocity and pressure via computational fluid dynamics simulations, there are still open questions about how sickle cells interact with plasma in a complex capillary network. In order to quantify the hemodynamic differences between normal and sickle cells, we introduced a sickle cell RBC model to massively parallel fluid-structure interaction software HARVEY. Notably, sickle RBCs exhibit increased margination, aggregation at the inner curvature, slower fluid velocity, higher pressure, and greater wall shear stress at standard hematocrit levels. This computational model facilitates detailed cellular modeling for hemodynamic simulations in complex capillary networks, offering predictive insight into blockage and potential vessel ruptures in patients with sickle cell disease."

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inflammatory pathology. We profiled plasma oxylipins in SCD (n = 45) and control children (n = 24), and evaluated their associations with inflammatory biomarkers, and SCD clinical history. We demonstrated the presence of PGE2, TxB2, RvE2, RvD1, AT-RvD3, and numerous monohydroxy-PUFAs in both SCD and control plasma. Levels of TxB2, RvD1, 12-HETE, 5-HEPE, and 7-HDoHE were significantly increased in SCD. 12-HETE and 5-HEPE correlated positively with IL-6 and IL-1β, respectively, while 15-HETE negatively associated with soluble-ICAM-1. 7-HDoHE levels were significantly lower in children with a history of VOC and ACS compared to those without any clinical complications. Since RvD1 is a pro-resolving mediator, the observed increase in RvD1 in SCD may reflect a host mechanism attempting to mitigate disease-associated chronic inflammation by promoting resolution of inflammation."

Next-generation sequencing genetic testing revealed that the patient also had hereditary pyropoikilocytosis (HPP), a severe form of hereditary elliptocytosis (HE), and was heterozygous for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. Following splenectomy, the frequency of her transfusions slightly decreased.

    "abstract": "Ischemic priapism is a male urologic emergency. Most cases have been linked to genetic conditions such as sickle cell disease and (much more rarely) glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, and the use of certain drugs. Here, we report the case of a 34-year-old male who was a known case of the recurrent ischemic type of priapism, which was relieved by penile aspiration. Genetic investigation revealed that the patient had glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase."

    "title": "Hidden stories of caregivers with children living with sickle cell disease in Uganda: Experiences, coping strategies and outcomes.",
    "abstract": "Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) poses a substantial public health challenge in Uganda, exhibiting distinct regional variations in prevalence. The Uganda Sickle Cell Surveillance Study has estimated an overall SCD prevalence of 13.3%. Notably, this prevalence varies significantly across the country's regions, reaching its highest in the northern region at 22.2% and it's lowest in the central region at 5.3%. This variation reflects the diverse impact of SCD and underscores the need for a comprehensive understanding of its regional implications. SCD places substantial physical, social, and psychological burdens on caregivers, potentially leading to heightened parental stress. However, limited research has focused on the daily challenges and experiences of SCD caregivers, despite evidence showing the detrimental impact on their emotional well-being, personal lives, employability, and socioeconomic status. This study explored the undisclosed struggles of Ugandan caregivers tending to children with SCD, uncovering their coping strategies and subsequent outcomes. In June and July 2023, we conducted in-depth interviews with caregivers at Mulago sickle cell clinic after obtaining their informed consent. An interview guide was used as the primary data collection tool, with interviews lasting 30-45 minutes. Twelve participants were recruited, ensuring comprehensive data collection by following the data saturation principle. We analyzed the collected data using open coding. Three key themes emerged: caregiver experiences, coping strategies, and outcomes. Initially, caregivers grappled with confusion and uncertainty before a formal diagnosis. Financial strain and inadequate support posed persistent challenges, affecting their emotional well-being. Coping strategies varied, encompassing traditional remedies and modern medical treatments for symptom relief. Coping outcomes were complex, reflecting caregivers' resilience alongside substantial emotional distress and sleep disturbances. The substantial financial burden further exacerbated their overall well-being. Elevating awareness and knowledge about sickle cell disease within communities is essential. Such awareness can empower caregivers of children living with sickle cell disease, promoting emotional resilience and mitigating family disruptions."

    "abstract": "A 56-year-old woman with sickle cell anemia (SCA) and metastatic neuroendocrine tumor refractory to somatostatin analog received 4 cycles of peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) with 177Lu-DOTATATE. The treatment schedule was delayed by multiple episodes of hospitalizations related to underlying SCA. PRRT was well-tolerated with stable renal, hematologic, and liver lab parameters. After PRRT, the disease remained stable for up to 13 months, and serum chromogranin levels declined by 45%. PRRT with 177Lu-DOTATATE can be safely administered for metastatic neuroendocrine tumors in patients with SCA with good anti-tumor effect. Disruption to the therapy schedule should be anticipated, given the potential for recurrent hospitalization for illnesses related to the underlying SCA."

    "abstract": "In high-income countries, individuals with sickle cell disease (SCD) almost universally survive into adulthood, but transfer to adult SCD care is fraught. The young adult clinic (YAC) at our sickle cell centre was designed to provide developmentally appropriate, expert SCD care to young adults with SCD aged 18-30 years. In this retrospective cohort study, we measured YAC appointment attendance and scheduling attempts based on patient referral source and demographic characteristics. Between 1 March 2019 and 30 September 2023, 89% (170/192) of referred patients attended a YAC appointment, and 97% (77/79) of patients referred from paediatric SCD care attended a YAC appointment. Most patients attended their first scheduled appointment (61%, 105/170). Among rescheduled patients, the mean number of scheduling attempts before attendance was 2.9 (standard deviation 1.5). During the 55-month study period, this cohort had five deaths (3%) and seven successful haematopoietic stem cell transplants (4%). These results indicate that healthcare systems designed to meet the needs of young adults with SCD enable successful participation in adult SCD care. Resources to build robust adult SCD care systems are desperately needed, alongside research regarding optimal approaches to integrating young people into adult SCD care."

    "abstract": "Chronic illnesses (CIs) are increasingly prevalent among children/young people (CYP) globally. For migrant CYP with CIs, achieving a stable life in a new country can be particularly challenging due to additional barriers such as cultural and language differences, unsafe living conditions, and discrimination. While migration can sometimes improve healthcare access by introducing new models of care and ways of understanding health, these advantages are often outweighed by obstacles that hinder access to essential services. This review aimed to map the global evidence on post-migration experiences and outcomes of CYP with CIs and to identify priorities for research, policy, and practice to improve their care. A scoping review was conducted following JBI guidelines. We searched seven online databases, including MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, Social Science Collection, and Web of Science, up to February 2024. Data were synthesised using a socio-ecological model, and four young migrants living with sickle cell disease in the UK contributed to the review through a Patient and Public Involvement Advisory Group. Of the 58 included papers, most focused on migration to high-income countries, particularly the USA, and used institutional records or case studies. Few studies provided detailed information about migration status or reason for migration, often using proxies like parental country of birth or language spoken. The socio-ecological model revealed disparities in health status, treatment access, and health outcomes for migrant CYP with CIs. Key challenges were language, communication, costs, bureaucracy, family dynamics, coordination issues, resource constraints, and socio-political influences. Significant gaps included a lack of intersectional analyses (e.g. accounting for 'race' and citizenship) and limited qualitative research capturing the lived experiences of migrant CYP with CIs. Migrant CYP with CIs face significant health disparities shaped by individual, social, and systemic factors. Addressing these challenges requires intersectional and qualitative research, alongside collaboration with policymakers, practitioners, and communities, to inform more equitable healthcare policies and practices."

    "abstract": "One of the most common presentations of sickle cell disease (SCD) in the emergency department (ED) is acute severe pain episodes due to a vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC). Management of these episodes is primarily through intravenous pain control, but patients often return to the ED with the same complaint a few days after discharge. While some global studies have explored the risk factors for ED revisits due to VOC, the literature is lacking in the adult population, specifically in Saudi Arabia where SCD prevalence is high. The goal of this study is to measure the incidence of ED 72-hour early revisit (ERV) among SCD patients due to a VOC episode and to identify factors that might be associated with an ERV in this population. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the electronic medical records, retrieving all patients who presented to the ED with a VOC from the period of 2017 to 2022. This study included 120 VOC visits. The percentage of 72-hour ERV to the ED among VOC patients was 39.2%, in which 91.5% received opioids, and 31.9% were admitted during the return visit. Return visitors' median age was 29, most of them were male. There was no statistically significant correlation found between the patients' 72-hour ERV to the ED and their age, gender, comorbidities, history of exchange transfusion, pain score, or dose of opiates received. Of the variables measured at the index visit only the direct bilirubin level, and time to first opioid dose was associated with 72-hour ERV with an OR of 1.08 (95%CI: 1.0 to 1.16, P = 0.022) and 0.99 (95%CI: 0.99 to 0.99, P = 0.012) respectively. We found that 39.2% of VOC episodes discharged from the ED had an ERV. This rate is higher than what is reported internationally. Additionally, the lack of clear predictors for revisits raises doubts regarding the efficacy of the ED ''treat and release'' approach in this population. Not applicable."

Here, we report fourteen candidate loci from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of HbF level in patients with SCD from Cameroon, Tanzania, and the United States of America. We present results of cell-based experiments for FLT1 candidate, demonstrating expression in early haematopoiesis and a possible involvement in hypoxia associated HbF induction. Our study employed genotyping arrays that capture a broad range of African and non-African genetic variation and replicated known loci (BCL11A and HBS1L-MYB). We estimated the heritability of HbF level in SCD at 94%, higher than estimated in unselected Europeans, and suggesting a robust capture of HbF-associated loci by these arrays. Our approach, which involved genotype imputation against six reference haplotype panels and association analysis with each of the panels, proved superior over selecting a best-performing panel, evidenced by a substantial proportion of panel-specific (up to 18%) and a low proportion of shared (28%) imputed variants across the panels."

This study aimed to evaluate the effect of nutritional supplementation in SCD-related complications. A systematic review with searches in PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science was performed. Randomized controlled trials (RCT) assessing diet or supplements as complementary therapy for children and adolescents with SCD were included (PROSPERO:CRD42024532369). The data for outcomes of interest (efficacy, safety) were pooled by means of pairwise and network meta-analyses with ranking (p-score) analysis. The results were presented as odds ratio or mean differences with 95 % confidence intervals (NMAstudio2.0). Twenty RCTs were included (2002-2023) (n = 2058), analyzing 9 dietary supplements on different regimens. All patients were in use of hydroxyurea as active treatment. Supplementation with fatty acids (n = 3 studies) and l-arginine (n = 4) presented higher efficacy and safety, significantly improving pain intensity, vaso-occlusive crises (VOC) and inflammation when compared to usual care/placebo (p < 0.05). Vitamin D3 (n = 6) at different dosages may reduce respiratory complications and length of hospital stay, yet further studies are needed to confirm its significant effects. Evidence is limited and of poor quality regarding the effects of add-on vitamin A (n = 2), magnesium sulfate (n = 2) and zinc (n = 4) for this population. The complementary use of certain supplements (fatty acids, l-arginine, vitamin D3) can enhance the management of VOC and improve patients' physiological functions. These supplements are often affordable and can contribute towards the reduction of opioid use and shorten patients' hospital stays - especially in low/middle-income countries where resources are scarce. Although further studies are needed to refine these findings (e.g., appropriate doses/regimens), practical guidelines and decision-makers may benefit from updated evidence."

    "title": "A differentiated β-globin gene replacement strategy uses heterologous introns to restore physiological expression.",
    "abstract": "β-Hemoglobinopathies are common monogenic disorders. In sickle cell disease (SCD), a single mutation in the β-globin (HBB) gene results in dysfunctional hemoglobin protein, while in β-thalassemia, over 300 mutations distributed across the gene reduce β-globin levels and cause severe anemia. Genetic engineering replacing the whole HBB gene through homology-directed repair (HDR) is an ideal strategy to restore a benign genotype and rescue HBB expression for most genotypes. However, this is technically challenging because (1) the insert must not be homologous to the endogenous gene and (2) synonymous codon-optimized, intron-less sequences may not reconstitute adequate β-globin levels. Here, we developed an HBB gene replacement strategy using CRISPR-Cas9 that successfully addresses these challenges. We determined that a DNA donor containing a diverged HBB coding sequence and heterologous introns to avoid sequence homology provides proper physiological expression. We identified a DNA donor that uses truncated γ-globin introns, results in 34% HDR, and rescues β-globin expression in in vitro models of SCD and β-thalassemia in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Furthermore, while HDR allele frequency dropped in vivo, it was maintained at ∼15%, demonstrating editing of long-term repopulating HSPCs. In summary, our HBB gene replacement strategy offers a differentiated approach by restoring naturally regulated adult hemoglobin expression."

The authors compared patient satisfaction with pain management between those randomized to receive either a patient-specific or weight-based pain protocol in the COMPARE-VOE randomized control trial. Participants with sickle cell disease were pre-enrolled and patient satisfaction with pain management was assessed at the time of discharge from the 6 participating emergency departments. Patients were randomized to receive a patient-specific or weight-based pain protocol. The authors compared continuous variables between the patient-specific and weight-based protocols with the 2-sample t test and categorical variables by the chi-square test. The authors enrolled 104 participants. Compared with satisfaction with pain management on previous ED visits, more participants in the patient-specific protocol group than the weight-based group (57.1% vs 31.8%; P = .02) were satisfied with pain management. Most who were discharged home (91.2%) felt their pain was sufficiently relieved to be discharged home. These findings support evidence-based guidelines to manage vaso-occlusive episodes in emergency departments. Patient-specific protocols can be implemented by partnering with local sickle cell disease providers to make protocols available in the emergency department."

    "abstract": "People with severe sickle cell disease (SCD) are now presented with increasing access to curative-intent therapies including allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) and gene therapy (GT). These high-risk, high-reward therapies offer hope for cure and prevention of further injury due to SCD, but they are toxic therapies that carry risk of additional morbidity and mortality. People with severe SCD suffer due to extreme pain and serious multi-system injury which is compounded by the effects of systemic racism. The increasing availability of these complex, sometimes novel, therapies with curative-intent highlights the role for specialist palliative care (PC) in the care of people with severe SCD. Multidisciplinary PC teams employ a holistic, person-centered approach to alleviating suffering by accompanying patients through high-stakes decision making, coping with life-threatening illness, and symptom management. The role for PC beginning early in HCT has been established, though PC is infrequently integrated in HCT. Little research exists regarding the role for PC in care of people with SCD. We present concepts of PC integration for people with SCD undergoing HCT or GT and advocate for PC integration beginning once patients consider a curative-intent therapy throughout the duration and following completion of treatment. As curative-intent therapies for patients with SCD continue to evolve, there is an opportunity for PC, HCT, and SCD teams to collaborate with patients to develop implementable models for high-quality, multidisciplinary care for people with severe SCD and their families."

    "abstract": "Malaria is a critical global health issue, particularly for children in endemic regions. However, factors associated with recurrent severe malaria in children under 5 years of age in Northern Uganda are poorly understood. This study aimed to identify factors associated with readmission due to severe malaria within six months post-discharge among children in this age group. A cross-sectional study was conducted in Otuke district, encompassing twelve health facilities. A total of 760 caregivers of children admitted with severe malaria were interviewed, and hospital records were reviewed to verify the readmission data. The primary outcome assessed was readmission with severe malaria within six months after initial discharge. Data analysis was performed via Stata version 15.0. The prevalence of readmission with severe malaria among children under 5 years of age was 26.8% (198/739). Factors significantly associated with readmission included having sickle cell anaemia [adjusted prevalence ratio (aPR) 1.72; 95% confidence interval (CI) (1.95-3.14)], living in houses constructed with straw and thatch walls [(aPR 2.10; 95% CI (1.19-3.69)] and seeking care after 12 h when the child has a fever [aPR 2.01; 95% CI (1.23-3.29)]. The findings indicate a high proportion of severe malaria readmissions in children under 5 years of age. Sickle cell anaemia, living in houses built using straw and thatch walls and seeking care after 12 h when a child has fever were the key risk factors for readmission with severe malaria. This study highlights the importance of targeted post-discharge interventions, such as prophylactic anti-malarials in addition to bed nets, to prevent recurrent infections especially among children with sickle cell disease. In addition, improvements in housing quality and timely treatment of children with malaria are essential for reducing the burden of malaria, particularly in endemic regions."

    "abstract": "Fetal hemoglobin (HbF) levels are influenced by various genetic modifiers, which have clinically beneficial effects on both β-thalassemia and sickle cell disease. HbF-associated genetic variants are distributed throughout the genome, and current detection methods are often costly, time-consuming, and require multiple tests. Therefore, developing rapid and economical methods for the simultaneous detection of HbF-associated variants is essential for improving the accurate diagnosis of β-hemoglobinopathies. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) was employed to detect 20 well-documented genetic modifiers in BCL11A, KLF1, HBG2, DNMT1, GATAD2A, and HBS1L-MYB intergenic polymorphism (HMIP). The new assay's accuracy, repeatability, and lowest detection limit were evaluated. It was subsequently applied to 81 samples, and the clinical effects of the modifiers were further verified in a cohort of 560 β-thalassemia patients. The MALDI-TOF MS assays successfully detected all 20 genetic modifiers simultaneously in a single reaction. Genotyping results from 15 repetitions were consistent and accurate, indicating the stability of this assay. The assay's lowest detection limit for DNA was as low as 0.2 ng, sufficient for simultaneous genotyping of all loci. A double-blind evaluation of 81 samples showed 100% concordance with traditional genotyping methods. Significant differences were observed in HbF levels, survival time without transfusion, and clinical classification for the detected genetic modifiers. The MALDI-TOF MS detection assay for HbF-related variants is simple, rapid and high throughput. It enables the detection of 20 genetic modifiers in a single test, supporting accurate large-scale detection and enhancing the precise diagnosis and clinical classification of β-thalassemia."

    "abstract": "Newly produced platelets acquire a low activation state, but whether the megakaryocyte plays a role in this outcome has not been fully uncovered. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were previously shown to promote platelet production and lower platelet activation. We found that healthy megakaryocytes transfer mitochondria to MSCs, which is mediated by connexin 43 (Cx43) gap junctions on MSCs and leads to platelets at a low energetic state with increased LYN activation, characteristic of resting platelets with increased LYN activation, characteristic of resting platelets. On the contrary, MSCs have a limited ability to transfer mitochondria to megakaryocytes. Sickle cell disease (SCD) is characterized by hemolytic anemia and results in heightened platelet activation, contributing to numerous disease complications. Platelets in SCD mice and human samples had a heightened energetic state with increased glycolysis. MSC exposure to heme in SCD led to decreased Cx43 expression and a reduced ability to uptake mitochondria from megakaryocytes. This prevented LYN activation in platelets and contributed to increased platelet activation at steady state. Altogether, our findings demonstrate an effect of hemolysis in the microenvironment leading to increased platelet activation in SCD. These findings have the potential to inspire new therapeutic targets to relieve thrombosis-related complications of SCD and other hemolytic conditions."

This single site retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted in a referral center for rare disease from January to July 2020. Fifty-eight patients with SCD were referred for an ophthalmological examination including automatic perimetry and OCT. The correlation between macular thickness and visual field defect in each Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) quadrants was calculated. Visual acuity was normal in 104 eyes (94.5%). Thirty-three eyes (30.0%) had a defect of visual field in at least one ETDRS quadrant. There was a significant correlation between macular thinning on OCT and decrease of the mean defect in visual field in the temporal quadrant (P < 0.001). When comparing sickle cell genotype groups, macular thickness was significantly reduced in temporal outer quadrants in patients with the SS genotype, and in the inner and outer temporal quadrants in other genotypes. Despite normal visual acuity, macular temporal thinning in patients with SCD is associated with visual field defects in SS genotypes. This points to a primitive vascular dysfunction rather than neurogenic mechanism in occurrence of SCD maculopathy."

Access to transfusions, iron chelation therapies and drugs such as hydroxyurea have improved life expectancy and quality of life. However, these diseases still cause significant disability. The first available curative therapy, bone marrow transplantation, is unfortunately not feasible for all patients. Over the past decade, numerous studies have focused on finding new curative therapies, and many clinical trials have evaluated different gene therapy approaches. The therapeutic targets focus on adding functional copies of the gene encoding β-globin in defective CD34 + cells, mainly using lentiviral vectors directed towards HSCs. More recently, the focus has shifted to inducing fetal hemoglobin production at therapeutic levels or repairing the underlying molecular defect, using novel gene editing techniques involving CRISPR-Cas9, transcription activation-like effector protein nucleases, zinc finger nucleases and base editing. Preclinical and clinical studies now focus on optimizing how gene therapy is performed and delivered to reduce or eliminate myeloablative treatment and its potential adverse events. In this review, we explore the potential to induce fetal hemoglobin production at therapeutic levels or to repair the underlying molecular defect that causes the disease genetically. Here, we review recent gene editing studies that are opening a new era in curative treatment for hemoglobinopathies."

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic chronic disease associated with lifelong complications, but there is limited analysis of the potential impact of religiosity and spirituality on SCD. This study aims to analyze the association between constructs of religiosity and spirituality with health outcomes (disease severity, depression, and pain) in an SCD population (<i>n</i> = 275). Data from the INSIGHTS Study (NCT02156102) were used for this analysis. The relationships between religious/spirituality measures (religious attendance, self-reported spirituality, religious saliency, coping, and support) and SCD outcomes (disease severity, depression, and pain scores) were analyzed through bivariate correlations and multivariable models. Models adjusted for different dimensions of religiosity and spirituality separately (Model 1) and all measures simultaneously (Model 2). In the bivariate analyses, we found a positive association between disease severity and spirituality (<i>P</i> < .05) and an inverse relationship between positive religious coping and depression (<i>P</i> = .01). In Model 1, which adjusted for individual measures separately, there was an association between SCD severity and spirituality (β = 0.07, <i>P</i> < .001) as well as with religious attendance (β = 0.02, <i>P</i> < .01). However, in the models that simultaneously adjusted for all the measures (Model 2), religious attendance was no longer associated with SCD severity (β = 0.006, <i>P</i> > .05), while the association with spirituality remained significant (β = 0.05, <i>P</i> < .05). The observed associations between spirituality and disease severity among patients with SCD suggest that individuals with severe disease may beneficially use spirituality to cope with complications. Future research should rigorously evaluate this hypothesis."

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a monogenic disease with a highly variable phenotype depending on the amount of fetal hemoglobin (HbF), the main modulator. Variation of HbF levels among patients is genetically regulated. HbF determines both the phenotype of the disease and the response to treatment with the main drug used, hydroxyurea. The efforts of the researchers have focused on discovering the genetic factors responsible for HbF variation, mainly describing the haplotypes of the β cluster and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at three different loci: BCL11A, HBS1L-MYB, and the β-globin cluster. This study aimed to determine the possible correlation between the number of SNPs and haplotypes with higher HbF levels in a cohort of patients with SCD. A positive association could explain why certain haplotypes, such as Senegal or Arab-Indian, show higher HbF levels and less severe disease. To test this hypothesis, the characterization of haplotypes was performed using the PCR-RFLP technique and genotyping of three SNPs representative of the three loci with the greatest association with HbF variation: <i>Xmn</i>I (rs7482144), BCL11A (rs4671393), and HBS1L-MYB (rs9376092). We found more SNPs in haplotypes related to higher HbF than those with less HbF, although only the SNP <i>Xmn</i>I (rs7482144) showed a statistically significant association. We found a direct correlation between haplotypes and the number of SNPs. Haplotypes with higher levels of HbF and less severe phenotypes showed a higher number of SNPs. Thus, the Benin and Bantu haplotypes traditionally associated with poor prognosis showed the fewest mutated SNPs."

Together, these stakeholders must define and establish a sustainable framework to support genetic research in Africa, increase the availability of genetic data from African populations, and set-up translational genomics medicine initiatives tailored to the continent's unique healthcare needs. Science advocacy and diplomacy is also needed to establish mechanisms that prevent the hoarding of genetic resources, including genetic data and novel interventions, and guarantee equitable access to the scientific, medical and economic benefits of genomics for all nations.

Advantages include decrease toxicity and applicability in patients otherwise unable to tolerate conditioning regimens due to end-organ damage or age. We aimed to add to published data outcomes of two similar NMA conditioning protocols, termed Protocol 1 (ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT00061568) and Protocol 2 (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT02105766)) in mainly adult patients with SCD to evaluate the safety, toxicity, and success of these regimens in individuals at high-risk for poor transplantation-related outcomes. We also evaluated the tolerability and outcomes of Protocol 2, which included preconditioning immunodepletion, in patients at even higher risk of T cell-mediated rejection or plasma/B cell-mediated anti-donor erythrocyte antibody production-the latter due to ABO incompatibility or recipient RBC alloimmunization to a donor antigen. Finally, we evaluated the incidence and trajectory of mixed donor myeloid chimerism over time following allo-HCT. In this retrospective analysis of the 2 prospective phase 2 NMA transplant protocols, 91 individuals with SCD or transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia underwent MRD allo-HCT at the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; regimens contained alemtuzumab, low-dose radiation, and sirolimus for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis with or without preconditioning immunodepletion with pentostatin and oral cyclophosphamide (Protocol 2). In the total cohort of 91 transplantation recipients, outcomes were favorable with timely neutrophil and platelet engraftment (median, 21 days [range, 7 to 67 days] and 21 days [range, 10 to 112 days], respectively), minimal high-grade acute GVHD and no chronic GVHD, overall survival of 90%, sickle-free survival of 85%, and mixed donor myeloid chimerism in 43% at a median follow up of 7.3 years (range, 0.8 to 20 years). Most patients with mixed myeloid chimerism at 2-years post-HCT remained stable in their values. In analyzing each protocol separately, outcomes were comparable except for higher cytomegalovirus reactivation necessitating treatment in Protocol 2 without an associated increase in graft failure. In the combined cohort, graft failure occurred in 11 patients, and hematologic malignancy or abnormal cytogenetics on bone marrow evaluation developed in 7 patients. In a subanalysis of factors that may implicate transplantation outcomes, the number of RBC units transfused post-HCT was significantly higher in recipients with pre-HCT history of alloimmunization to donor RBC antigens. There was no difference in the number of RBC units transfused, duration of transfusion, or red cell engraftment in those with major ABO incompatibility; preconditioning immunodepletion and pretreatment with rituximab likely were helpful. Both NMA allo-HCT protocols were successful in achieving adequate engraftment and sickle-free survival with minimal toxicity, including in individuals with mixed donor myeloid chimerism. The addition of preconditioning immunodepletion was well-tolerated and reduced the rate of graft failure in high-risk recipients."

    "title": "Bone marrow transplant protects mice from sickle cell-mediated large artery remodeling.",
    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a hereditary blood disorder that causes sickling of red blood cells under deoxygenation, which stiffens and damages the cells. Individuals homozygous for the mutant β-globin S allele (SS) endure complications including progressive arterial damage and heightened risk of stroke. The effectiveness of bone marrow transplantation (BMT), now the only curative treatment for SCD, in halting or reversing SCD-mediated arteriopathy remains unclear. This study used two distinct conditioning regimens, x-ray irradiation and chemotherapy, in a Townes humanized murine model of SCD. Mice homozygous for the SS allele underwent BMT at 2 or 4 months of age, time points that we deemed early or late, respectively. Label-free magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) was performed to longitudinally monitor common carotid artery luminal areas in living mice pre- and repeatedly post-BMT, followed by histological analysis of the arteries at euthanasia. Myeloablative chemotherapy demonstrated higher survivability in SS mice compared with x-ray irradiation. SS mice exhibited arterial outward expansion by 3 months and thinning of the medial layer at 5 months, which are characteristics of a weakened arterial wall. BMT at 2 months effectively halted this expansion, maintaining smaller luminal areas in SS mice. However, BMT at 4 months did not reverse arteriopathy, indicating the importance of early intervention. This work emphasizes how MRA can be used as a noninvasive method for assessing arteriopathy progression and demonstrates that the timing of BMT is crucial in mitigating sickle cell-induced large artery remodeling."

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) in pregnancy constitutes a high-risk pregnancy, associated with increased risk of adverse outcomes. To describe the outcome of pregnancy in SCD women managed at the University College Hospital, Ibadan, Nigeria. A retrospective review of the health records of sixty-three SCD pregnant women managed between January 1, 2016 and December 31, 2020. The information extracted included sociodemographic and obstetric characteristics, clinical presentations, mode of delivery, maternal and fetal outcomes. The data was analyzed using the IBM Statistical SPSS Statistics for Windows, version 23.0. Test of association was done using Chi-square and level of significance was p<0.05. Prevalence of SCD in pregnant women was 0.65%. Mean age was 28.8±4.1years, 63.5% were haemoglobin SS while 36.5% were haemoglobin SC. Most of the women had tertiary education (61.8%) and booked for antenatal care (ANC) (60%). About 72.4% delivered at term while 46.1% had caesarean delivery. Most common complication was anaemia (79.4%) while vaso-occlusive crisis was the most common type of crisis (55.6%). Most of the women (92.5%) had live-birth with 15.2% of neonates requiring Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) admission. Maternal death rate was 6.3%. Good maternal and fetal outcomes occurred in 71.4% and 61.9% of participants respectively. Good maternal outcome was significantly associated with tertiary education(p=0.01). Good fetal outcome was associated with tertiary level of education(p=0.04) and multigravida status(p=0.03). SCD pregnant women have good fetal-maternal outcomes, however not receiving ANC and lower level of education were associated with poor pregnancy outcomes. Health education, access to ANC, prompt diagnosis, treatment of complications and multi-disciplinary team management will improve the pregnancy outcomes."

    "abstract": "Several comorbidities of sickle cell disease (SCD) originate from red blood cell (RBC) instability, chronic inflammation, and oxidative stress. Development of scalable, cost-effective therapeutics suitable for chronic administration to prevent, attenuate, and perhaps reverse the consequences of RBC instability is needed. Curcumin has many of these attributes as a safe compound with antisickling, antiinflammatory, and antioxidant properties, but its translational potential has been constrained due to limited bioavailability from oral administration. The present study demonstrates the rapid and high bioavailability of a novel topical/transdermal (TD) curcumin gel formulation in the plasma and blood cells and its effectiveness in humanized sickle cell mice in: (i) ameliorating features of sickle cell pain hypersensitivity and axonal injury; (ii) reducing multiple manifestations of RBC instability including evidence of decreased hemolysis (reduced lactate dehydrogenase levels), enhanced RBC ATP levels along with decreased oxidative damage; (iii) decreasing multiple proinflammatory cytokines including interleukin-6, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted protein in skin secretome; and (iv) reducing mast cell degranulation and activation. Our data suggest that an easy-to-use novel TD curcumin gel formulation has the potential to ameliorate chronic pain, improve RBC stability, and reduce inflammatory consequences of SCD."

There is minimal information on longitudinal COVID-19 immune profiling in recovered versus naïve and vaccinated versus non-vaccinated healthcare workers (HCWs). <b>Methods:</b> This is a prospective longitudinal observational cohort of pediatric HCWs (pHCWs) conducted during 2020-2022 at an academic center, exploring the impact of COVID-19 vaccination on immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody titers over time and cross-reactivity with other coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, and seasonal coronaviruses (HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43). <b>Results:</b> A total of 642 pHCWs initially enrolled, and 337 participants had repeat IgG titers measured post-vaccine and post-booster. Most participants were female, median age range of 31-40 years. Anti-spike was higher in all vaccinated individuals versus non-vaccinated (<i>p</i> < 0.0001) and naïve versus infected (<i>p</i> < 0.0001). A single dose of vaccine was sufficient to attain maximum titers in recovered participants versus naïve who received both doses of vaccine. Anti-spike titers dropped significantly at 9 months after the primary series, whereas sustained anti-spike titers were observed at 9 months post-booster. <b>Conclusions:</b> All vaccinated pHCWs developed antibodies to spike. COVID-19 infection and/or vaccination yielded antibodies that cross-reacted to SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-OC43. Anti-spike titers were more durable post-booster compared to the primary series. Longitudinal immune profiling of COVID-19 responses provides vital data to shape public health policies, optimize vaccine strategies, and strengthen pandemic preparedness."

    "abstract": "Immune system impairment is frequently reported in patients affected by hemoglobinopathies due to various mechanisms, including iron accumulation, antigenic stimulation due to numerous transfusions, chronic hemolysis, and a general hyperinflammatory state. For these reasons, the antigenic immune response after a vaccine risks being ineffective. We evaluated the anti-spike IgG production after two doses of vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 in patients affected by hemoglobinopathies. All 114 enrolled patients (100%) developed adequate antibody production, with a median value of serum IgG of 2184.4 BAU/mL (IQR 1127.4-3502.9). The amount of antibody was unrelated to any other clinical characteristics evaluated, including transfusion dependence or non-transfusion dependence, age, gender, disease type, ferritin, blood count, spleen status, and therapy with hydroxyurea or iron chelators (in all the cases <i>p</i> > 0.05). Moreover, 47 (41.2%) patients developed breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infection during the first 2 years of follow-up after vaccination, all with a mildly symptomatic course, without requiring hospitalization or experiencing a significative drop in hemoglobin values, allowing for a slight delay in their transfusion regimen. Vaccination against COVID-19 is safe and effective for patients affected by hemoglobinopathies, ensuring adequate protection from severe infection."

    "abstract": "Several etiologic factors for the development of acute leukemias have been suggested; however, none is applicable to all cases. We isolated a certain mycovirus-containing <i>Aspergillus flavus</i> (MCAF) from the home of a patient with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Repeated electron microscopic evaluations proved the existence of mycovirus in this organism. According to chemical analysis, this organism does not produce any aflatoxin, possibly due to its infestation with mycoviruses. We reported that using the ELISA technique, forty pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) uniformly had antibodies to the products of MCAF. In contrast, three separate groups of controls, consisting of normal blood donors, individuals with solid tumors, and patients with sickle cell disease, were negative. In vitro exposure of mononuclear blood cells from patients with ALL, in full remission, to the products of MCAF induced redevelopment of cell surface phenotypes and genetic markers characteristic of ALL. The controls were negative. The incubation of normal and ALL cell lines with the products of MCAF resulted in significant cellular apoptosis, changes in the cell cycle, and the downregulation of transcription factors, including PAX-5 and Ikaros (75 and 55 kDa). Fungi are widespread in nature, and many contain mycoviruses. Normally, an individual inhales 1 to 10 fungal spores per minute, while farmers can inhale up to 75,000 spores per minute. It is known that farmers and foresters, who are more exposed to fungi, have a higher rate of acute leukemia. In contrast, asthmatics, most of whom are allergic to fungal agents, and individuals working in office settings have a lower rate. One of the theories for the development of acute leukemia suggests a genetic predisposition followed by exposure to an infectious agent. With the above findings, we propose that mycovirus-containing <i>Aspergillus flavus</i> may have an etiological role in leukemogenesis in immune-depressed and genetically susceptible individuals."

    "abstract": "Heme oxygenase (HO) metabolizes heme into ferrous iron, carbon monoxide (CO), and biliverdin-IXα (BV), the latter being reduced into bilirubin-IXα (BR) by the biliverdin reductase-A (BVR). Heme oxygenase exists as two isoforms, HO-1, inducible and involved in the cell stress response, and HO-2, constitutive and committed to the physiologic turnover of heme and in the intracellular oxygen sensing. Many studies have identified genetic variants of the <i>HO/BVR</i> system and suggested their connection in free radical-induced diseases. The most common genetic variants include (GT)n dinucleotide length polymorphisms and single nucleotide polymorphisms. Gain-of-function mutations in the <i>HO-1</i> and <i>HO-2</i> genes foster the ventilator response to hypoxia and reduce the risk of coronary heart disease and age-related macular degeneration but increase the risk of neonatal jaundice, sickle cell disease, and Parkinson's disease. Conversely, loss-of-function mutations in the <i>HO-1</i> gene increase the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and some types of cancers. Regarding <i>BVR</i>, the reported loss-of-function mutations increase the risk of green jaundice. Unfortunately, the physiological role of the HO/BVR system does not allow for the hypothesis gene silencing/induction strategies, but knowledge of these mutations can certainly facilitate a medical approach that enables early diagnoses and tailored treatments."

However, graft failure, severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), infections, and mortality remain a concern. We evaluated a novel conditioning regimen followed by related HLA-haploidentical BMT in adults with sickle cell disease. In a phase 2, open-label, single-arm, multicenter study, 54 eligible participants from 19 U.S. centers were enrolled. Of these, 42 (78%) received transplantation with conditioning including antithymocyte globulin, fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, thiotepa, and total body irradiation. GVHD prophylaxis included posttransplant cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil, and sirolimus. The primary outcome was event-free survival at 2 years, while secondary outcomes included overall survival and other transplant-related end points. The median age at enrollment was 22.8 years (range, 15.5 to 43.2), and the median follow-up period was 37.2 months (range, 20.4 to 56.4). The 2-year event-free and overall survival rates were 88.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 73.5 to 94.8%) and 95.0% (95% CI, 81.5 to 98.7%), respectively. Two participants experienced primary and another secondary graft failure. The incidence of grade-3-to-4 acute GVHD at day 100 was 4.8% (95% CI, 0.9 to 14.4%), while the 2-year chronic GVHD rate was 22.4% (95% CI, 10.9 to 36.4%). Two of the four reported deaths were due to early infectious complications. HLA-haploidentical BMT is an accessible and potentially curative therapy for adults with sickle cell disease.

    "abstract": "Splenic dysfunction in children with sickle cell disease (SCD) increases the risk of serious bacterial infections; therefore, families are instructed to seek medical care in the presence of fever. Recurrent hospital admissions of patients with SCD cause financial and resource burdens on caregivers and the health care system, contributing to a lower quality of life in this patient population. Recent studies have documented a reduction of the incidence of bacterial infections among these patients managed on an outpatient basis with no association of increased morbidity and mortality. We decided to establish a partnership between our pediatric hematology/oncology division and pediatric emergency medicine division to initiate an algorithm to identify low-risk patients eligible for outpatient management. We conducted a retrospective review of patients with SCD younger than 18 years of age, followed at the Comprehensive Care Sickle Cell Center at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC), who presented to our Pediatric Emergency Department (ED) with a temperature ≥101°F from July 1, 2018 to June 30, 2020. The mean length of stay and age at admission were nearly equal between pre-implementation and post-implementation of the algorithm. The admission rates from the study for were 55.2% and 43.6% pre-implementation and post-implementation, respectively. Patients revisited the ED within 72 hours in 6.7% of patients in pre-implementation and 5.9% of patients in post-implementation. There were no patient deaths. Our pathway helps standardize the treatment of febrile pediatric patients with SCD. Although the decrease in admissions did not reach statistical significance, the > 10% decrease in admissions was likely meaningful to reduce health care burdens for patients and families."

    "title": "The Direct Medical Costs of Sickle Cell Disease in Saudi Arabia: Insights from a Single Center Study.",
    "abstract": "<b>Background</b>: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder that is common in countries with consanguineous marriages. It leads to various complications, including painful episodes, infections, delayed growth, stroke, and organ damage, which contribute to high healthcare utilization and costs. In Saudi Arabia, the prevalence of SCD is notably high, largely due to the frequency of consanguineous marriages. However, there has not yet been a study estimating the direct medical costs of managing SCD based on real-world data. This study aims to assess these costs in Saudi Arabia. <b>Methods</b>: Data were collected from electronic medical records (EMRs) at a university-affiliated tertiary care center. A micro-costing approach was used to estimate the direct medical costs (e.g., laboratory tests, imaging, emergency department visits, hospitalizations, prescription medications, outpatient visits, etc.) retrospectively over a 12-month follow-up period. The baseline characteristics of the patients were presented using frequencies and percentages. The costs of different healthcare services were analyzed using means and the 95% confidence intervals. A generalized linear model (GLM) with a gamma distribution was utilized to examine the association between the overall costs and patient characteristics (e.g., age, gender, duration of illness, surgeries, blood transfusions, etc.), allowing for the estimation of the adjusted mean costs. <b>Results</b>: A total of 100 patients met the inclusion criteria and were included in the analysis. The mean age of the patients was 10.21 years (±6.87 years); 53% were male, and a substantial majority (96%) had the HbSS genotype. Sixty-one percent of the patients had undergone at least one red blood cell (RBC) exchange transfusion, while 21% had undergone surgical procedures, including tonsillectomy, splenectomy, and cholecystectomy. Additionally, 45% had experienced at least one vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC), and 59% had been hospitalized at least once in the past 12 months. Factors such as the frequency of laboratory tests and imaging studies, the length of hospital stay (LOS), the rate of emergency department (ED) visits, surgical procedures, the number of prescription medications, and the frequency of blood transfusions were all significant predictors of higher direct medical costs (<i>p</i> < 0.05). The estimated mean annual direct medical costs per patient were USD 26,626.45 (95% CI: USD 22,716.89-USD 30,536.00). After adjusting for various factors, including age, gender, duration of illness, frequency of lab and imaging tests, LOS, ED visits, surgical procedures, number of prescription medications, rates of VOCs, and RBC exchange transfusions, the adjusted mean annual direct medical cost per patient was calculated to be USD 14,604.72 (95% CI: USD 10,943.49-USD 19,525.96). <b>Conclusions</b>: The results of this study emphasize the substantial direct medical costs linked to sickle cell disease (SCD), which are greatly affected by the frequency of related complications. These insights should motivate policymakers and healthcare researchers to assess both the national direct and indirect costs associated with SCD, especially given the significant number of SCD patients in Saudi Arabia."

Data were analyzed through a rapid qualitative approach. <b>Results</b>: Fifty-two studies were identified and seventeen articles were included. The nurse's role is key and multidisciplinary, focusing on the child and family (care management and therapeutic education), the team (training, and the promotion of safety and quality of care), and the health system (optimizing access to care and promoting adequate resources for its implementation). Such a role is important for short-term clinical problems and to prevent long-term complications. <b>Conclusions</b>: Nurses play a central role in empowering families and coordinating multidisciplinary care. Greater investment is needed at a clinical level, through a more effective response to the needs of these patients, and in research, through experimental studies and other designs focused on multidisciplinary interventions."

    "abstract": "β-globin gene cluster regulation involves complex mechanisms to ensure proper expression and function in RBCs. During development, switching occurs as γ-globin is replaced by β-globin. Key regulators, like BCL11A and ZBTB7A, repress γ-globin expression to facilitate this transition with other factors, like KLF1, LSD1, and PGC-1α; these regulators ensure an orchestrated transition from γ- to β-globin during development. While these mechanisms have been extensively studied, circRNAs have recently emerged as key contributors to gene regulation, but their role in β-globin gene cluster regulation remains largely unexplored. Although discovered in the 1970s, circRNAs have only recently been recognized for their functional roles, particularly in interactions with RNA-binding proteins. Understanding how circRNAs contribute to switching from γ- to β-globin could lead to new therapeutic strategies for hemoglobinopathies, such as sickle cell disease and β-thalassemia. This review uses the circAtlas 3.0 database to explore circRNA expressions in genes related to switching from γ- to β-globin expression, focusing on blood, bone marrow, liver, and spleen. It emphasizes the exploration of the potential interactions between circRNAs and RNA-binding proteins involved in β-globin gene cluster regulatory mechanisms, further enhancing our understanding of β-globin gene cluster expression."

Oxidized heme derivatives induce platelet activation, aggregation, and degranulation, leading to prothrombotic and inflammatory events. In the present study, we showed that hematin is a more potent agonist of platelet activation than hemin, and using several methods, including the original laser diffraction method, flow cytometry, and confocal microscopy, we demonstrated that hematin at low doses induces platelet activation and aggregation without reducing cell viability and affecting calcium efflux. On the contrary, hematin at high concentrations triggered phosphatidylserine exposure, severe loss of platelet viability, and calcium dysregulation, which was not inhibited by cGMP/PKG and cAMP/PKA pathways. Additionally, we showed that albumin could initiate disaggregation processes in hematin-activated platelets."

This study was conducted from July 2022 to June 2024 at Kalinga Institute of Medical Sciences, Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India, and included 126 children (63 with SCD, 63 with other forms of anemia) aged between six to 18 years. Anthropometric data, clinical history, and laboratory parameters were collected, and pulmonary function tests (PFTs) were performed using spirometry to evaluate forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1). Children with SCD had lower height and weight than those in the control group, with height differences reaching statistical significance. Hemoglobin levels were higher in SCD cases than those in the control group, despite both groups exhibiting anemia. The PFTs revealed lower mean FVC and FEV1 in SCD patients, with a predominant restrictive pattern observed in 40 children with SCD (63.4%) compared to 25 children (39.6%) in controls. Only 17 children with SCD (29.6%) showed normal PFT results. Among risk factors, older age, history of vaso-occlusive crises, acute chest syndrome, and blood transfusions were linked to restrictive abnormalities, though not statistically significant. Children on hydroxyurea showed a trend toward restrictive PFT patterns. The study underscores the high prevalence of restrictive lung function abnormalities in children with SCD, highlighting the importance of regular pulmonary monitoring and early intervention to address pulmonary complications. Further research is warranted to explore the impact of hydroxyurea and the cumulative effect of vaso-occlusive events on lung function in SCD."

    "abstract": "Respiratory infection may account for 30% of acute chest syndrome (ACS) aetiologies. However, antimicrobials are routinely prescribed, and de-escalation and/or discontinuation are challenging. Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction (mPCR) with an enlarged respiratory panel might support antimicrobial stewardship, and procalcitonin (PCT) measurements help reduce duration of antibiotic therapy. We hypothesized that a strategy combining the use of mPCR with repeated PCT measurements would reduce antibiotic exposure during ACS. We conducted a randomised, controlled, parallel group, open-label study in two French hospitals. Consecutive adult patients with ACS were randomly assigned to the conventional or interventional strategy, where antibiotic therapy was targeted on the results of mPCR performed on lower respiratory tract secretions (LRTS) samples, and antibiotic discontinuation based on PCT values and kinetics at Day 1 (D1), D3 and D7. The primary outcome was the number of days of antibiotic exposure at D28 after randomisation. This trial was registered on ClinicalTrial.gov (NCT03919266) and is closed to recruitment. From June 2020 to September 2022, 72 patients were assigned to the interventional (n = 37) or conventional strategy (n = 35). Despite a higher rate of microbiological documentation with the intervention (n = 25; 67.6% versus n = 13; 37.1%; difference, 30.4%; 95% CI 6.7%-51.5%), antibiotic exposure at D28 was similar between the two strategies (6 days [4.0-8.0] versus 6 days [5.0-9.0], respectively; difference, 0.0 day; 95% CI, -2.1 to 2.1).

Our study objective was to evaluate acute care trends before and after PDMP implementation among people with SCD. We carried out a retrospective longitudinal cohort study of 13 698 individuals with confirmed or probable SCD in the Georgia Sickle Cell Data Collection program from 2010 to 2019. Primary outcomes were monthly rates of emergency department (ED) visits per 1000 people with SCD; 3-day ED revisits per 1000 visits; inpatient discharges per 1000 people with SCD; 30-day readmissions per 100 discharges; and patient days hospitalized per 100 discharges. We observed that, at the start of the PDMP mandate, the volume of ED visits was 12.7% lower during the mandatory PDMP period (relative risk, 0.873; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.843-0.904) compared with what pre-PDMP trends would have predicted. The 3-day ED revisits followed a similar pattern. No associations were observed with inpatient hospitalization rate. There was a 0.7% monthly increase in readmissions during the PDMP mandate (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 1.007; 95% CI, 1.002-1.013) compared with 0.1% before the PDMP (IRR, 1.001; 95% CI, 1.000-1.001). The volume of patient days was higher during the PDMP phase-in period but no different during the mandate. ED use by people with SCD decreased after PDMP implementation, and there was an uptick in the monthly rate of increase in 30-day readmissions after the PDMP mandate. Further research into the impact of opioid control policies on people with SCD is warranted."

    "title": "Histomorphology of placentae of women with sickle cell disease during pregnancy - A case control study.",
    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is known to exert multifaceted effects on pregnancy, potentially influencing placental structure and function. Our aim was to utilize stereology as a precise analytical tool to evaluate the histo-morphologic and functional changes in term placentae of women with SCD against those of non-SCD women. A case control study was conducted at the Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital's labour unit and included 38 pregnant women, comprising 19 cases and 19 controls. Placenta samples were paired and matched with gestational age and taken at term (38 weeks + 2 weeks). Tissue sections were prepared, stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and volume densities of syncytial knots, foetal capillaries, syncytial denuded areas, and intervillous spaces estimated by stereological methods. Statistical analysis was performed to compare mean values between the SCD and control groups. Among the study participants with SCD, 13.16% (5) had sickle cell haemoglobin S (HbSS), 34.21% (13) had haemoglobin C (HbSC) and 2.63% (1) had β-thalassemia (HbS). On stereological assessment, there were statistically significant differences in mean volume densities of syncytial knots (p = < 0.0034), foetal capillaries (p = < 0.0001), syncytial denudations (p = < 0.0028), and intervillous space (p = < 0.0113) between term placentae of women with SCD and those without SCD. SCD placentae may result in a substantial increase in syncytial knot formation, possibly because of hypermaturation of the chorionic villi, significant increase in foetal capillaries potentially due to the hypoxic nature of the SCD placentae, syncytial denuded areas as a result of alteration of the placental syncytium and reduced intervillous spaces which may be due to villous congestion. These findings suggest the need for heightened monitoring of placental function and fetal well-being in pregnancies complicated by SCD to reduce adverse perinatal outcomes."

    "abstract": "Adults with sickle cell disease (SCD) are at a higher risk for psychosocial stress; however, there is limited research on how that stress manifests along with the relevant psychosocial experiences in adults with SCD. The purpose of the current integrative review was to synthesize the current research on psychosocial experiences among adults aged 18 to 40 years with SCD. PubMed, CINAHL, and PsycINFO were searched for relevant articles, with 12 articles ultimately included in this study. Across studies, adults with SCD were at a higher risk for psychosocial stress based on objective measurements and qualitative interviews. Findings demonstrate the importance of routinely screening for psychosocial stress using objective measures, and the need to create a psychologically safe environment for people with SCD to express their concerns.

    "abstract": "Individuals living with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) are subject to numerous chronic complications, including disabling chronic pain, often dependent on opioids and with important repercussions on the quality of life. The use of Medicinal Cannabis in this scenario may be a promising strategy for mitigating this impact. This work compiles current knowledge regarding the endocannabinoid system in humans and the role of this system in various organic functions. Articles were retrieved through a comprehensive search of the PubMed NCBI database, covering relevant studies up to 2024. These data bring important speculations on the potential role of the use of medicinal cannabis in modulating SCD chronic complications, and the preliminary results of clinical trials carried out in this condition are discussed. The search for understanding the role of cannabis-derived products in the management of chronic complications of sickle cell disease could add resources to the serious challenge of dealing with the multiple aspects of the disease faced by patients. They range from the management of chronic pain itself to the risks of opioid dependence, in addition to other difficult scenarios, such as leg ulcers and chronic inflammation and its consequences."

    "abstract": "Bone marrow transplant and gene therapy are high-risk, high-reward treatment options that have the potential to cure sickle cell disease (SCD). Making the decision to pursue curative therapies remains challenging for adults living with SCD and little is known about their experience in deciding to cure it. The purpose of this study was to describe the lived experiences of adults living with SCD considering curative treatments. A qualitative descriptive phenomenological study was used for the study. Nine adults with SCD were recruited from a large, urban, academic medical center in the Northeast. Semi-structured interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using Amedeo Giorgi's 5-step data analysis for descriptive phenomenology. Five major themes were derived from the data analysis: (1) the never-ending rollercoaster of uncertainty in SCD; (2) the hospital feeling like a second home; (3) the powerful influence of the provider; (4) changing the trajectory of the past in pursuit of new beginnings; and (5) going the distance to access a cure. The results revealed that the participants' experiences in deciding to pursue curative therapies were multifactorial, they had limited access to educational material, they delayed seeking curative therapies, and they required complex care management to navigate health systems when seeking curative options. Findings underscored the importance of nurses understanding the experience of living with SCD, the patient-provider relationship, and barriers to accessing care. Findings can influence policies on SCD care pre- and post-transplant, and inform nursing practice and nursing education."

    "abstract": "Many adolescent and young adult (AYA) patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) visit the emergency department (ED) for vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) pain management. Clinical guidelines from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) suggest that patients should receive an Emergency Severity Index (ESI) of 2 and analgesics within 60 minutes of registration. Despite guidelines, SCD patients experience treatment delays. Our objectives are to describe a Mid-Atlantic healthcare system's guideline adherence and examine the effect of time to first analgesic administration (TFAA) on ED disposition. A retrospective cross-sectional study of the electronic health record data set of ED SCD patient encounters from July 2016 to June 2017 was conducted. Descriptive statistics were run for patient characteristics. ED encounters that followed NHLBI guidelines were included in the data set. Independent t-tests were conducted to examine TFAA differences among patients admitted and not admitted. Majority of encounters were classified as ESI 3 (75.6%), and the mean TFAA was 108.9 minutes. Of ED encounters, 23.9% followed ESI guidelines, 21.5% followed TFAA guidelines, and 4.1% followed both NHLBI guidelines. There was a nearly significant difference in mean TFAA among patients discharged from the ED and admitted to the hospital, a mean difference of -24.5 minutes (t=-1.925; p=0.056). Despite existing ED guidelines, SCD patients experience delayed and variable care. Our results show faster TFAA could potentially decrease admission rates."

A randomized control trial was conducted [NCT06296654]. A total of 76 patients were recruited by using a cluster sampling technique in the two health centers in Bahrain from February to May 2022 and randomly allocated to the intervention group (<i>n</i> = 38) or control group (<i>n</i> = 38). The intervention group received the empowerment-based intervention implemented through structured small-group discussion sessions, individualized consultations (5A model: assess, advise, agree, assist, and arrange), and follow-up sessions, while the control group received routine health education. The Sickle Cell Self-Efficacy Scale (SCSES) and the Appraisal of the Self-Care Agency Scale-Revised (ASA-R) were measured at baseline and one month after the intervention among two groups of patients. A total of 68 patients completed the study (36 patients in the intervention group and 32 patients in the control group). After the intervention, the score of SCSES in the intervention group was 37.0 (35.0, 39.8) higher than the control group 28.0 (25.2, 32.0) (<i>U</i> = - 6.121, <i>P</i> < 0.001); the score of ASA-R in the intervention group was 61.0 (58.3, 65.0) higher than the control group 49.0 (43.3, 53.0) (<i>U</i> = 0.653, <i>P</i> < 0.001). Adopting the empowerment-based intervention using the 5As model effectively improves self-efficacy and self-care capacity among patients with SCD."

    "abstract": "Genome editing enzymes can introduce targeted changes to the DNA in living cells <sup>1-4</sup> , transforming biological research and enabling the first approved gene editing therapy for sickle cell disease <sup>5</sup> . However, their genome-wide activity can be altered by genetic variation at on- or off-target sites <sup>6-8</sup> , potentially impacting both their precision and therapeutic safety. Due to a lack of scalable methods to measure genome-wide editing activity in cells from large populations and diverse target libraries, the frequency and extent of these variant effects on editing remains unknown. Here, we present the first population-scale study of how genetic variation affects the cellular genome-wide activity of CRISPR-Cas9, enabled by a novel, sensitive, and unbiased cellular assay, GUIDE-seq-2 with improved scalability and accuracy compared to the original broadly adopted method <sup>9</sup> . Analyzing Cas9 genome-wide activity at 1,115 on- and off-target sites across six guide RNAs in cells from 95 individuals spanning four genetically diverse populations, we found that variants frequently overlap off-target sites, with 13% significantly altering Cas9 editing activity by up to 33% indels. To understand common features of high-impact variants, we developed a new massively parallel biochemical assay, CHANGE-seq-R, to measure Cas9 activity across millions of mismatched target sites, and trained a deep neural network model, CHANGE-net, to accurately predict and interpret the effects of single-nucleotide variants on off-targets with up to six mismatches. Taken together, our findings illuminate a path to account for genetic variation when designing genome editing strategies for research and therapeutics."

Using the French national health database, all singleton pregnancy-related hospital discharges from 2013 to 2020 in women aged 15-55 (n = 5 752 080) were selected. Of these, 1022 births were to women with SCD, 308 of whom were on long-term treatment, that is, hydroxyurea (HU) and/or transfusion programme. Pregnancies with SCD were more likely to involve pre-eclampsia (9.6% vs. 1.7%; p < 0.001), pulmonary embolism (0.70% vs. 0.02%; p < 0.001), caesarean sections (52.8% vs. 18.2%; p < 0.001) and postpartum haemorrhage (8.3% vs. 4.1%; p < 0.001) compared to pregnancies without SCD. Preterm birth (<37 weeks) was much more common in women with SCD (28.5% vs. 5.6%). Infants born to women with SCD faced greater adverse neonatal outcomes (22.4% vs. 8.0%; p < 0.001). Although untreated SCD was linked to fewer complications than long-term treated SCD, both conditions presented greater risks compared with pregnancies without SCD. Unexpectedly, babies born to women with SCD had a higher incidence of congenital abnormalities (6.3% vs. 3.4%; p < 0.001), not attributed to HU use. Overall, despite advances in SCD management, pregnancy in SCD remains a high-risk condition, for both mothers and babies."

    "abstract": "This study aims to evaluate the financial implications of implementing various payment models, including outcome-based agreements (OBAs), volume-based rebates, and guaranteed rebates, for the newly approved gene therapies, exagamglogene autotemcel (exa-cel) and lovotibeglogene autotemcel (lovo-cel), in the treatment of sickle-cell disease (SCD) from the perspective of Colorado Medicaid. The analysis specifically examines the cost of standard of care (SoC) for severe SCD, the impact of different eligibility criteria based on vaso-occlusive events (VOEs), and the potential financial impacts associated with rebate structures. Data from the Colorado Department of Health Care Policy & Financing (HCPF) database was used to estimate the annual costs for Medicaid-enrolled patients with severe SCD from 2018 to 2023. Patients were selected based on various eligibility criteria, including the number of VOEs, acute chest syndrome events, and stroke diagnoses. Three-state Markov models (SCD, stable, and dead) were constructed to compare the costs of SoC and gene therapies. The durability of gene therapy effectiveness and the financial impact of OBAs, volume-based rebates, and guaranteed rebates were evaluated over a 6-year contract period, with scenarios reflecting different VOE criteria and treatment durability. The average annual SoC cost for severe SCD patients (N = 138) was US$45,941 (SD US$59,653), with higher costs associated with more frequent VOEs. Gene therapies exa-cel and lovo-cel, with one-off list prices of US$2.2 million and US$3.1 million, respectively, exhibited high upfront costs, resulting in a negative cumulative balance averaging - US$2.11 million for exa-cel and - US$3.00 million for lovo-cel per patient over 6 years compared with SoC. Outcome-based rebates could potentially save Medicaid approximately US$260K (uncertainty interval 88K-772K) per patient on average for exa-cel and US$367K (uncertainty interval 122K-1111K) for lovo-cel after they pay the full up-front cost. Volume-based and guaranteed rebates also offered potential savings but varied in impact based on contract duration and effectiveness of gene therapy. The study highlights critical considerations for Medicaid in negotiating OBAs for SCD gene therapies. Achieving budget neutrality over 6 years is unlikely due to low SoC costs. However, payment models can enhance value-based spending by linking high therapy costs and potential rebates to the health gains these treatments may offer. OBAs offer offsets contingent on therapy effectiveness durability and contract terms (such as length and price), while varying eligibility criteria impact budgets and outcomes. Medicaid real-world data is crucial for navigating complexities in defining eligible populations and structuring OBAs."

    "abstract": "The Portuguese Newborn Screening Program currently includes 28 pathologies: congenital hypothyroidism, cystic fibrosis, 24 inborn errors of metabolism, sickle cell disease and spinal muscular atrophy. This pilot study for sickle cell disease newborn screening, including 188,217 samples, was performed between May 2021 and December 2023, with phase I, including 24,130 newborns, in the Lisbon and Setubal districts and phase II, including 164,087 newborns, in the whole country. DBS samples were analyzed through capillary electrophoresis. In phase I, a high birth incidence of sickle cell disease was found (1:928 NBs), resulting from the identification of 24 HbSS and 2 HbSC patients. This birth incidence decreased but remained significant when the pilot study for sickle cell disease newborn screening was expanded to a national level, with the identification of 67 sickle cell disease patients (59 HbSS and 8 HbSC), revealing a birth incidence of 1:2449 NBs. These data suggest that this condition is becoming increasingly relevant in Portugal, thus reflecting a general European trend, where sickle cell disease is already recognized as a public health problem. Therefore, it highlights the importance of its integration into the Portuguese National Newborn Screening Program panel in January 2024, thus allowing the early identification and clinical follow-up of these patients."

So far, about twelve tumors of RCCU-MP have been reported in the literature. Herein, we extend this observation to a tumor of RCCU-MP in a 39-year-old patient, morphologically similar to renal medullary carcinoma. SMARCB1 expression was absent by immunohistochemistry, but there was no evidence of hemoglobinopathy. The tumor cells were positive for keratin19, PAX8 and PAX2. GATA3, OCT3/4, and ALK were negative. Fluorescence in situ hybridization was conducted to detect the <i>SMARCB1</i> gene locus on chromosome 22 (22q11.23 region). The results showed no evidence of deletion or translocation involving the gene. Perirenal lymph node metastases were detected. The patient did not receive any treatment. Six months after surgery, she developed a local recurrence. In addition to <i>SMARCB1</i> gene deletion or translocation, other factors may be associated with the loss of INI1 (SMARCB1) protein. The presence of perirenal lymph node metastases and recurrence despite nephrectomy is indicative of the poor prognosis of this tumor. Further investigation of the relationship between the loss of SMARCB1 protein and the development of RCCU-MP might improve our understanding of the pathogenesis of this malignant tumor."

    "abstract": "Pyruvate kinase (PK) is a key enzyme involved in the final step of glycolysis, essential to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Relatively decreased red blood cell (RBC) PK activity (reflected by a lower PK/hexokinase [HK] ratio) and PK thermostability (PK activity after exposure to heat) were recently identified as pathophysiological features of sickle cell disease (SCD). In this study, we investigated whether impaired PK function is associated with sickle RBC properties and SCD-related clinical manifestations. This study included 97 non-transfused patients with SCD (88 HbSS, 9 HbS/β0 thalassemia). PK thermostability was correlated with RBC parameters such as reticulocyte count (r = -0.402, p < 0.0001) and hemoglobin F (r = 0.394, p < 0.0001), and indicators of impaired functional properties of sickle RBCs, such as the point of sickling (r = -0.417, p < 0.0001), oxygen affinity (r = 0.408, p < 0.001) and RBC adhesion to laminin (r = -0.322, p = 0.024). Additionally, a low PK/HK ratio correlated with decreased PK thermostability (r = 0.308, p = 0.002), decreased RBC deformability (r = 0.268, p = 0.009), and elevated 2,3-diphosphoglycerate levels (r = -0.244, p = 0.016). Multivariate Poisson regression analysis demonstrated that reduced PK thermostability and PK/HK ratio were associated with a higher incidence of SCD-related clinical complications. For every 10-unit decrease in PK thermostability and 1-unit decrease in PK/HK ratio, the incidence of SCD-related clinical complications increased by 11% (p = 0.012) and 10% (p = 0.019), respectively. Altogether, these findings indicate that impaired PK function is related to compromised sickle RBC properties and SCD-related clinical manifestations. This supports the relevance and underlines the potential of PK activation therapy."

The children underwent tonometry evaluation (aortic systolic BP) and continuous BP and ECG measurements in supine and standing positions, allowing ambulatory BP monitoring and the computation of heart rate variability indices, baroreflex sensitivity (BRS), and orthostatic systolic BP response. Supine and standing BRS correlated significantly with aortic systolic BP (ρ = -0.34, ρ = -0.52, respectively), daytime systolic BP (ρ = -0.33, ρ = -0.54, respectively), low frequencies power in similar body positions (supine: ρ = 0.68, standing: ρ = 0.65), and high frequencies (HF) power (ρ = 0.78, ρ = 0.76, respectively). Orthostatic BP response correlated significantly with standing BRS (ρ = -0.38) and standing HFnu (ρ = -0.46). In multivariate analyses, only supine and standing HF power remained independently associated with the respective BRS, while standing HFnu and standing BRS were independently associated with the orthostatic pressor response. Defective parasympathetic modulation's detrimental effect on baroreflex sensitivity and the orthostatic pressor response in childhood is evident, regardless of the underlying pathology."

Emerging evidence reveals that SCD pathophysiology increases risk of myeloid malignancies and hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) dysfunction, possibly due to pathological stress on bone marrow. To investigate this further, we interrogated mice and individuals with SCD and observed extended cell cycle times, oxidative stress, DNA damage, senescence, and dysregulation of molecular programs associated with these processes in bone marrow hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Human SCD HSPCs displayed poor hematopoietic potential <i>ex vivo</i> . SCD mice displayed a dramatic loss of transplantable bone marrow HSPCs, which was reversed upon treatment of SCD mice with the senolytic agent, ABT-263 (navitoclax). Thus, senolytics restore bone marrow function during SCD in mice and represent a novel strategy to improve bone marrow health in individuals with SCD and improve the safety of potentially curative gene therapies that utilize autologous HSPCs from individuals with SCD."

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a single-gene illness characterized by chronic inflammation, decreased quality of life, and early mortality; however, outcomes are highly variable between individuals, suggesting a substantial role of social and environmental factors in disease outcomes. Data suggest that individuals living with SCD have greater eosinophil counts and activation, and higher prevalence of asthma and wheezing than those without SCD, suggesting a role for eosinophilic inflammation in SCD. In other diseases, eosinophilic inflammation has been linked to social and environmental factors, particularly in minoritized populations. To date, however, few human studies have explored the pathophysiology of social and environmental exposures in SCD. This study tested whether eosinophilic inflammation was related to location-based measures of social disadvantage or public housing in 79 individuals with SCD, without diagnoses of asthma, who were prospectively followed over one year. Home addresses were geocoded and matched to principal-components derived, validated measures of local neighborhood social disadvantage and to locations of public housing facilities. Serum peripheral eosinophils, IL-13 and IL-5 were measured every 8 weeks. In fully-adjusted models, statistically significant, linear relationships were observed between the degree of social disadvantage and level of eosinophilic inflammation; however, the direction of that relationship was opposite for patients who live in public housing and those who do not. For those living in public housing, greater social disadvantage was associated with increased eosinophilic inflammation. For those in private housing, greater social disadvantage was associated with progressively less eosinophilic inflammation. These strong, and somewhat unexpected, relationships demonstrate that subtle differences in social exposures and home environment have differential effects on inflammatory profiles which may have larger implications for disease and health, especially in chronic diseases such as SCD. To understand the mechanisms of these effects may require highly granular studies that catalog the many factors underlying the social environment and inflammation."

Four participants without abnormal enrolment TCD developed acute stroke within the initial 16 months (incidence 0.62 per 100 person years); Two had enrolment HbF ≤3.1%, 2 had low oxygen saturation (90%), 1 had recurring severe anemia necessitating multiple transfusions. Apparent stroke precipitants were severe malaria, acute chest syndrome, recent pain crisis or uncertain cause. At trial completion, 8 additional participants had a higher risk TCD category than at enrolment. Effectiveness of TCD screening for stroke prevention may vary by region, as no participant with incident stroke was at highest risk. Antecedent and/or ongoing SCA-related risks of anemia, low HbF, hypoxemia, infections and/or disease complications likely contributed to stroke despite trial HU. Results suggest that TCD alone may not fully identify highest stroke risk in the region, and need for primary stroke prevention from early and continuous hydroxyurea therapy."

    "abstract": "Plasma free hemoglobin (PFH) is a direct biomarker for hemolysis that has been associated with clinical complications such as pulmonary hypertension and death in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). We sought to characterize the relationship between PFH and more clinically available hemolytic markers including lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), bilirubin, reticulocyte percentage and to derive a composite hemolysis score derived from principal component analysis (PCA) of these biomarkers. In 68 adult patients (median age 31 years old, IQR 25-39) with HbSS or HbSβ<sup>0</sup>-thalassemia enrolled in the IMPROVE II study, median PFH was elevated at 21.9 mg/dL (IQR 9.9-44.9 mg/dL) at steady state. Using Pearson correlation analysis, PFH had a stronger relationship to LDH (R = 0.699), AST (R = 0.587), and total bilirubin (R = 0.475), compared to reticulocyte count (R = 0.316). The hemolysis score was significantly associated with PFH (R = 0.677). When compared with other laboratory measures, PFH correlated with hemoglobin (R= -0.275) and HbS (R = 0.277), but did not correlate with white blood cell count (WBC) or HbF. The hemolysis score was significantly associated with WBC (R = 0.307), hemoglobin (R = -0.393), HbF (R=- 0.424), and HbS (R = 0.423). This study confirms that the conventional hemolytic biomarkers LDH, AST, bilirubin, and reticulocyte percentage correlate with PFH. Additionally, the hemolysis score is a valid tool to measure hemolysis and that it may be a marker of global hemolysis as opposed to PFH, which quantifies intravascular hemolysis. Further studies will be needed to elucidate the role of PFH and intravascular hemolysis in the development of clinical complications of sickle cell disease.

However, these guidelines lacked implementation strategies for incarcerated individuals, a vulnerable group with unique challenges. In 2024, an ASH special panel of SCD and carceral health experts convened to address acute SCD care in custody settings, emphasizing timely access to emergency care, including acute management for acute strokes, pain management, and fever evaluation. The ASH special panel recommended prearranged emergency plans for transfer to specialized facilities, continuity of care with SCD specialists, and adherence to community-level care standards. Limitations included insufficient population data and absent chronic care guidelines. The ASH special panel urged that future ASH guidelines address SCD management tailored to carceral settings to reduce morbidity and ensure equitable care."

    "abstract": "Effective blood transfusion services rely heavily on comprehending the distribution of blood antigens among populations. Saudi Arabia's unique genetic and evolutionary influences require thorough comprehension of these antigen frequencies as they are crucial for patient care. This systematic analysis aimed to explore the frequencies of Rh and Kell blood group antigens across various regions of Saudi Arabia. An exhaustive literature search was conducted using PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library, focusing on studies from 2019 through 2024 that report Rh and Kell blood antigen frequencies within the Saudi population. Analysis of seven selected studies provided data from locales including Samtah, Jazan, Hail, Riyadh, the Eastern region, Taif City, and Najran. The DCcee (R1r) Rh phenotype was the most prevalent throughout these regions. However, the frequencies of individual Rh (D, C, E, c, e) and Kell (K) antigens demonstrated regional variability. Notably, the K antigen was found to be less common in Jazan compared to other regions. The observed variations in antigen frequencies suggest that factors beyond geography may influence the distribution of Rh and Kell blood groups. Comprehending these findings is critical for enhancing blood transfusion services, including refining donor recruitment strategies, managing blood inventory, and developing personalized transfusion protocols. Additionally, understanding similarities and variations is essential for managing pregnancies affected by Rh incompatibility and improving care for patients with conditions like sickle cell disease that require frequent transfusions. Further investigation is needed to explore the underlying causes of regional similarities or variations. Further studies are necessary to investigate the genetic and environmental factors influencing the regional similarity and differences in blood group antigen frequencies. Expanding the scope of data collection throughout Saudi Arabia is also imperative to provide a comprehensive understanding that supports optimal transfusion practices and enhanced healthcare outcomes."

A total of 317 children with a median age of 8 years (Interquartile range: 4-12) were included. Both parents knew their Hb phenotype in 7.3% of cases. Nineteen children had sickle cell disease (6.0%) and about 15.6% of the children had sickle cell trait AS. This study found a high frequency of children with sickle cell disease seen in pediatric clinics. We therefore emphasize the need for continued education to improve knowledge of the hemoglobin phenotype at community level and the importance of premarital screening to reduce this burden in the country."

This retrospective review aimed to describe the clinical outcomes of procedurally managed abortions and early pregnancy losses among individuals with sickle cell disease at a single center. We identified 19 individuals with sickle cell disease who underwent 24 procedures for the management of abortion (n = 18) or pregnancy loss (n = 6) at our center from 2013 to 2022. There were few procedure-related complications. Most of the post-procedural complications were painful crises. Individuals with a high frequency of painful crises before the procedure had a 1.2 higher odds of experiencing post-procedural painful crises (95 % CI: 1.0-1.4). Individuals with higher baseline rates of painful crises were more likely to develop post-procedural pain crises. This study is the first since 1995 to report on abortion and pregnancy loss outcomes in SCD. As threats to accessing reproductive health care continue to grow in the U.S., we must refine practice models to deliver safe care to patients with SCD who seek reproductive health services."

Hence, this study attempted to explore the knowledge and perceptions of the healthcare providers related to Sickle Cell Disease and effectiveness of the interventions. This qualitative study was conducted during evaluation phase of the quasi-experimental study at Chhotaudepur district, Gujarat. It included 26 healthcare providers of four cadres, namely peripheral health workers (PHWs), lab technicians (LTs), pharmacists, and medical officers (MOs) from two intervention Primary Health Centres. Data was collected through in-depth interviews. Most of the respondents were aware of the correct cause, etiology, and symptoms of SCD. They had knowledge of management as well, although it was mainly focused on symptomatic treatment delivered through this intervention study. Respondents shared that the disease can be prevented by mass screening, awareness generation, and counselling. Almost all respondents unanimously believed that this intervention study had positive impacts on community by establishing three tier screening mechanism and strengthening health system capacities. Study findings revealed adequate knowledge and positive attitude among healthcare providers related to SCD. They also perceived positive impacts of the interventions on the community in terms of improved knowledge, and awareness related to SCD diagnosis and treatment. Thus, it underscores the significance of knowledge and positive attitude in the primary healthcare providers to deal with the burden of the disease on the ground level."

The affected populace are disadvantaged due to a lack of accessibility and unavailability of transportation, flawed communication systems, insufficiency of health professionals, and basic health infrastructure. The objective was to set up a yoga-based lifestyle intervention (YBLI) center that is sustainable, accessible, affordable, and acceptable as the part of the Integrated Sickle Cell Anemia Research Program (ISCARP) randomized control trial study. By analyzing previous government screenings, the study identified remote, high-prevalence areas. Based on these criteria, encompassing 58 villages were surveyed in Maharashtra. Bijari village in Nandurbar was chosen for setting up the YBLI center. This center was equipped with basic health facilities and Information and Communication Technology infrastructure, managed in a hybrid model by ISCARP staff and incentive-based government health workers. A Central Control Center was established at SVYASA University in Bangalore to coordinate all the activities. The YBLI center was successfully set up in Bijari village. At the center, around 69 children and adolescents got benefited during Yoga intervention. Only one subject out of 34 in intervention cohort experienced mild crisis. Their basic vitals were recorded regularly. On 11 different occasions, sever crisis of the participants was addressed which reduced morbidity and mortality rate. Furthermore, a social and health profile of these participants was created and updated regularly using sickle cell patient Information Management System, SIMS Portal. Establishment of easily accessible YBLI center for providing primary healthcare, tele consultation with doctors, and maintaining electronic medical record and monitoring and recording vitals in addition to providing adjuvant Yoga therapy. By offering prompt medical help and counseling, the YBLI center reduced the psychological and economic strain of sickle cell disease on the local populace.

    "abstract": "Total hip arthroplasty (THA) is one of the most common orthopaedic procedures performed in the United States, but there are rare complications which can be devastating. Sickle cell disease (SCD) can lead to avascular necrosis of the femoral head, often necessitating THA. This article seeks to better characterize the complication risks in patients undergoing THA with SCD when compared to osteoarthritis (OA) using a large database from the National Inpatient Sample. National Inpatient Sample data from 2006 through the third quarter of 2015 were analyzed using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes. A weighted frequency of 4,350,961 THAs were recorded for OA and 4279 for SCD. These were compared using a Rao-Scott chi-squared test, and the prespecified complications were given sampling weights to approximate national estimates. The following complications were found to occur at a significantly increased frequency in patients with OA with SCD vs OA only: wound infection (0.69% vs 0.36%), dislocation (1.68% vs 0.80%), and urinary complications (3.61% vs 2.35%). SCD, when evaluated independent of avascular necrosis, was reported with higher frequency wound infection (0.86% vs 0.36%), and overall complications (7.25% vs 5.06%). Additionally, multiple comorbidities were significantly more prevalent in the SCD population compared to OA patients. This study illustrates that patients with SCD have increased complication rates when compared to OA patients. This information benefits orthopaedic surgeons in preoperative and postoperative planning and counseling patients for realistic expectations. Furthermore, this study provides data that could benefit decision-making on bundled reimbursement for this specific patient population."

    "title": "Indications for Blood Transfusion and Exchange Transfusion in Sickle Cell Disease: A Single Center Experience.",
    "abstract": "Background Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a prevalent inherited hemoglobinopathy characterized by chronic hemolytic anemia, vaso-occlusive crises (VOC), and multi-organ complications. Blood transfusion plays a critical role in the management of both acute and chronic complications associated with SCD, including stroke, acute chest syndrome (ACS), and splenic sequestration. However, the variability in transfusion practices and associated risks, such as alloimmunization and iron overload, necessitates further investigation into optimizing transfusion strategies in pediatric SCD patients. Objectives This study aimed to identify the most common indications for blood transfusion and exchange transfusion in pediatric patients with SCD at King Salman Armed Forces Hospital (KSAFH) in Tabuk, Saudi Arabia, from June 2020 to June 2024. By analyzing transfusion patterns and their outcomes, we sought to provide insights into improving transfusion management in this population. Methods An observational cross-sectional study was conducted on 99 pediatric SCD patients aged 1 to 14 years who received transfusions at KSAFH. Data were collected retrospectively from electronic medical records, including patient demographics, transfusion indications, hemoglobin levels, and adverse reactions. Descriptive statistical methods were used to assess the prevalence of various transfusion indications, and chi-square and analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests were applied to evaluate associations between clinical variables and transfusion outcomes. Results The study found that 68 patients (68.7%) required multiple transfusions, with exchange transfusions being used in 32 patients (31.3%), primarily for severe complications. ACS was the leading indication for transfusion, occurring in 32 patients (32.3%), followed by hemolytic crisis in 18 patients (18.2%), stroke prevention in 11 patients (11.1%), and splenic sequestration in eight patients (8.1%). Preoperative transfusions were administered to eight patients (8.1%), while seven patients (7.1%) required transfusions for aplastic crisis. More than 75% of ACS cases were managed with simple transfusions, and all showed significant improvement. Hydroxyurea non-compliance was notably high, with 64 patients (64.6%) not adhering to the regimen. Adverse transfusion reactions were rare, occurring in only four patients (4%), with fever being the most common reaction. Conclusions Blood transfusion remains an essential component of managing pediatric SCD, particularly for ACS, stroke prevention, and other severe complications. Simple transfusions were observed to be effective in many ACS cases, suggesting a role for less invasive interventions in specific clinical contexts. However, variability in transfusion practices and the high rate of hydroxyurea non-compliance highlight the need for standardized transfusion guidelines and enhanced patient education."

SCD is highly prevalent in Sub-Saharan Africa, with Nigeria having the largest burden. This qualitative study is aimed at exploring possible psychosocial and academic challenges associated with sickle cell disease among undergraduates in Nigeria. From September 2023 to February 2024, the authors conducted an exploratory descriptive study using in-depth interviews among 22 undergraduate students with SCD at Bowen University, Osun State, Nigeria, employing an in-depth interviewer guide. Ethical approval was obtained from Bowen University Ethical Review Board prior to the conduct of the study. The data was analyzed using inductive thematic analysis. Six (6) distinct themes emerged from the research data and each of the themes was linked to the study objectives. Many of the participants expressed disruption of academic activities by frequent SCD crisis. This negatively affected their academic performance, and sometimes led to feelings of frustration. Furthermore, the recurrent battles with pain due to vascular occlusion took a toll on their emotional and psychological health. They also experienced stigmatization and strained interpersonal relationships which negatively influenced their mental well-being. Conversely, some SCD patients enjoy some social support from colleagues and family members which gives hope and succor to them during difficult times. This study reveals that undergraduates with SCD face various academic and psychosocial challenges that affect their overall performance. The findings underscored the need for increased awareness, support, and understanding to better assist undergraduates with SCD in managing their health and academic responsibilities effectively. Considering the chronic nature of SCD and its myriads of psychosocial and academic challenges, measures should be put in place to mitigate the challenges and enable them to live a fulfilling life."

This article describes the implementation of a THA program at Monkole Hospital in the Democratic Republic of Congo, focusing on the technical challenges and surgical complications. The objective is to share our experience to assist other professionals and organizations in similar settings. Eight THA surgery campaigns were conducted between July 2019 and February 2023. Most patients presented with femoral head necrosis secondary to sickle cell anemia. Demographic and surgical data, technical difficulties, and complications were prospectively collected, and follow-up was conducted by a local orthopedic surgeon. Seventy-three surgeries were performed on 63 patients with a mean age of 34 years and an average follow-up of 24 months. Seventeen intraoperative technical incidents (23.2%) were observed. The postoperative complication rate was 9.5%, and three patients required revision surgery due to complications. The THA program at Monkole Hospital demonstrates that it is feasible to perform complex surgeries in developing countries and that it is a cost-effective procedure that improves patients' quality of life, provided there are adequate hospital infrastructures, team training, availability of implants, and ensured proper care and follow-up. Training local surgeons and investing in resources are key to the sustainability of the program and the improvement of surgical care."

    "abstract": "Asplenia and splenic dysfunction is associated with an increased risk of severe and fatal infections, especially due to encapsulated bacteria including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae serotype b (Hib) and Neisseria meningitidis. People with sickle cell disease (SCD) develop recurrent splenic infarcts rendering them functionally asplenic. Consequently, additional vaccination against these three pathogens is recommended. There is robust evidence of an increased risk for invasive pneumococcal (IPD) and Hib disease, in people with SCD, but for not invasive meningococcal disease (IMD). We conducted a systematic review according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) recommendations. Studies published in any language before June 2024 and including people with SCD of all ages and from all geographical locations were included. Studies were included if they documented bacterial culture and/or PCR in patients with SCD with suspected infection. The primary outcome was to estimate IMD risk in people with SCD. Secondary outcomes included estimating the risk of IMD and Hib disease in people with SCD. We identified 3804 publications and included 86 in the final analyses. Among 74 cohort studies published during 1971-2023, there were three IMD cases among 26,404 persons with SCD compared with 570 IPD and 113 Hib cases. Eight case-control studies published during 1983-2022 reported one IMD case among 932 people with SCD (0.1%) compared to 118 IMD cases among 7143 people without SCD (1.65%). In contrast, there were 126 IPD cases (126/932, 13.5%) in people with SCD compared to 588 (588/7143, 8.2%) in those without SCD. For Hib, the rates were 32/932 (3.4%) and 316/7143 (4.4%), respectively. After including all published studies, we identified five IMD cases in people with SCD across studies published worldwide during 1965-1995 and all five survived their infection. We found no evidence of any increased risk of IMD in people with SCD. This has important implications for policymakers in countries and organisations that currently recommend meningococcal vaccination for people with SCD."

This study characterized barriers and facilitators to care for SCD in the context of the Conceptual Framework of Access to Care Model. This qualitative descriptive study was conducted using semi-structured interviews with 27 patient/caregivers focused on sickle cell anemia (SCA; a subtype of SCD). Data were analyzed using directed content analysis with the model above as the initial coding framework. Themes were identified among healthcare system and patient/community-level factors. Healthcare system facilitators predominated themes, with a focus on the extent to which the healthcare services provided were a good match for the family and available and accommodating to patient and family needs. Additional facilitators at the patient/community level focused on whether patients and families could perceive and seek out, reach and pay for, and engage with healthcare. Barriers reflected the opposite experiences, with negative or challenging healthcare experiences and adverse social determinants of health interfering with access to care. Barriers and facilitators were mapped to the Conceptual Framework of Access to Care Model, with facilitators playing a more substantial role than barriers in access to comprehensive care among children with SCA and their caregivers. A focus on optimizing facilitators at both the healthcare system and patient/family level may have a considerable impact on improving access to and engagement in care."

This study aimed to systematically research the literature to investigate factors associated with ECG abnormalities in SCD patients. Five online databases of PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Embase, and Google Scholar were reviewed using a broad search strategy to identify original studies reporting factors associated with abnormal ECG findings among patients with SCD. Using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software, various effect sizes-odds ratios (ORs), mean differences, and correlation coefficients-were analyzed, pooled with a random effects model, and visualized through forest plots. Data analysis from 23 studies covering 2943 SCD patients revealed increased odds of prolonged QTc interval (2.54, 95% CI = 1.34-4.83), ST segment elevation (9.23, 95% CI = 3.15-27.07), and ST segment depression (3.82, 95% CI = 1.99-7.33) during crises. Patients with moderate SCD severity had higher odds of having any ECG abnormalities compared to those with mild severity (2.80, 95% CI = 1.47-5.33). No significant associations were observed between moderate and mild severity for left ventricular hypertrophy, sinus arrhythmia, and sinus tachycardia, or between male and female for having any ECG abnormalities, left ventricular hypertrophy, and prolonged QTc interval. Additionally, mean hemoglobin level was 0.60 mg/dL lower (95% CI = -0.91 to 0.28) in those with prolonged QTc interval. This study highlights the link between SCD status and severity, and hemoglobin, and ECG abnormalities. It emphasizes the need for cardiac monitoring, caution with QTc-prolonging medications, and routine ECG assessments to prevent cardiovascular complications in these high-risk patients."

    "abstract": "Red cell exchange (RCE) is an important treatment for sickle cell disease (SCD). It is a resource-intensive intervention requiring large volumes of red blood cells (RBC), which are frequently antigen-matched. Efforts to reduce the volume of units transfused, while maintaining treatment efficacy is an important need. This study evaluates the impact of a change to isovolemic hemodilution (IHD)-RCE on RBC utilization in SCD patients at a Canadian center. Adult SCD patients receiving chronic automated RCE at the Ottawa Hospital were approached for study inclusion. To safely attain a meaningful reduction in transfused RBCs, RCE parameters were individualized for each patient. IHD-RCE was performed only if an estimated reduction in RBC volume of at least 200 mL was expected, with hematocrit not allowed to decrease below 20%. Data were compared in the 6-months before and after the protocol change. Twenty-two adult patients met the criteria for inclusion. There was a net reduction of 107 RBC units after the transition from standard RCE to IHD-RCE (1035 vs. 928 units; -10.3%). The mean number of RBC units transfused per patient decreased by 4.8 (47.0 vs. 42.2 units; p = .01). No difference in target post-RCE hemoglobin S levels was observed. In this study IHD-RCE reduced RBC utilization without impacting efficacy or safety, conserving 107 RBC units (an annualized savings of $95,444 CAD). No adverse events due to saline replacement were observed. Increased awareness of the benefits of IHD-RCE through knowledge translation could promote greater uptake."

In the local emergency department, the patient was diagnosed with presumed SCT using the sickle cell solubility test. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) of the abdomen and pelvis obtained 12 hours after symptom onset was read as mild heterogenous enhancement of the spleen but without acute disease. After supportive care, the patient was discharged the next day with recommendations to descend immediately for presumed splenic syndrome. When his symptoms continued for days unabated, the patient presented to his primary care office, and repeat imaging performed 10 days later demonstrated a large splenic infarction. The patient recovered fully with supportive therapy and the diagnosis of SCT was confirmed by hemoglobin electrophoresis."

Self-efficacy is a person's particular set of beliefs in their ability to accomplish daily life activities with symptom management. The aim of the present study was to explore the level of self-efficacy among adolescents with SCD. A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted to assess the self-efficacy of adolescents with sickle cell disease using a purposive sampling of 300 adolescents diagnosed with SCD in a tertiary care center in east-central India. A sickle cell self-efficacy scale was used to collect data between November 2023 and April 2024. Data was analyzed using descriptive statistics and linear regression. The mean age at which adolescents were diagnosed with SCD was 3.31 ± 0.14 years, and 69.7% (209) of adolescents were identified between the ages of one and five years. Additionally, 73% (219) of adolescents had moderate self-efficacy. The current study found that most adolescents had a moderate level of self-efficacy, and regression analysis showed that the strong predictors for higher self-efficacy levels were higher education, economic status, place of residence, and age group. The adolescents had a moderate level of self-efficacy. Future interventions are recommended to help improve self-efficacy in adolescents with SCD."

    "title": "The impact of red cell storage age on transfused patients with sickle cell disease: protocol of a pilot randomized clinical trial to evaluate changes in inflammation and clinical transfusion efficacy.",
    "abstract": "Despite fulfilling all requirements for donor blood units as defined by the FDA, a number of patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) are transfused with red blood cell (RBC) units that are near the end of their storage life, exposing them to the potentially adverse components of the red cell storage lesion. Due to their chronically inflamed state, patients with SCD may be particularly susceptible to these components. We present here a pilot study protocol for testing the impact of fresh vs older red cell units in chronically transfused adults with SCD. This is a randomized, prospective, clinical trial. We aimed to recruit forty chronically transfused adults or adolescents with SCD who receive regular RBC transfusions for their clinical care and randomize these patients to receive either units greater than or equal to 30 days, or units less than or equal to 10 days for 3 consecutive outpatient transfusion events. The primary endpoint is the metabolic differences identified between units transfused that are greater than or equal to 30 days, and those units less than or equal to 10 days. The secondary endpoint evaluates the change in blood monocyte activation at 2 hours after transfusion between the two groups. Lastly, weevaluate unit RBC efficacy via changes in hemoglobin/day, hemoglobin A%/day, hospitalization rate, pain scores, and infections as documented via blood and urine cultures. This study promises to provide evidence as to whether metabolically older red cell units affect the quality and efficacy of chronic transfusion therapy for adults with SCD and has the potential to guide the need for future study on this important clinical issue."

    "title": "Metabolic and Proteomic Divergence is Present in Spleens and Livers from Berkeley Sickle Cell Anemia and β-Thalassemia Mice.",
    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease and β-Thalassemia are two of the most prevalent hemoglobinopathies worldwide. Both occur due to genetic mutations within the HBB gene and are characterized by red blood cell dysfunction, anemia, and end-organ injury. The spleen and liver are the primary organs where erythrophagocytosis, engulfing the red blood cells, occurs in these diseases. Understanding metabolism and protein composition within these tissues can therefore inform the extent of hemolysis and disease progression. We utilized a multiomics approach to highlight metabolomic and proteomic differences in the spleen and liver. The Berkley sickle cell disease (Berk-SS), heterozygous B1/B2 globin gene deletion (Hbb<sup>Th3/+</sup>) a known β-Thalassemia model, and wildtype (WT, C57/Bl6) murine models were evaluated in this report. This analysis showed Berk-SS and Hbb<sup>Th3/+</sup> shared distinct antioxidant and immunosuppressive splenic phenotypes compared to WT mice with divergence in purine metabolism, gluconeogenesis, and glycolysis. In contrast, Berk-SS mice have a distinct liver pro-inflammatory phenotype not shared by Hbb<sup>Th3/+</sup> or WT mice. Together, these data emphasize that metabolic and proteomic reprogramming of the spleen and livers in Berk-SS and Hbb<sup>Th3/+</sup>mice may be relevant to the individual disease processes."

The studies included were identified through a search of databases such as PubMed, Scopus, Science Direct, Web of Science, and Embase, as well as Google Scholar engine, adhering to specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. Heterogeneity among the primary study results was assessed using the I-squared index, while publication bias was evaluated through funnel plots, Egger's test, and trim and fill analysis. All statistical analyses were conducted using R software, version 4.3.0. 79 primary studies were included, comprising 6,256 children (<18 years old) and 6,582 adults (≥18 years old) with SCD from 22 countries. The prevalence of elevated ePASP was found to be 21.8% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 18.46 to 25.07) in children and 30.6% (95% CI: 27.1 to 34.1) in adults. The prevalence of elevated ePASP among studies with severe SCD genotypes including HbSS and HbS/β0 was found to be 19.45% (95% CI: 14.95 to 23.95) in children and 29.55% (95% CI: 24.21 to 34.89) in adults. Furthermore, sex-specific prevalence among SCD patients with elevated ePASP indicated the highest prevalence in male children at 60.35% (95% CI: 54.82 to 65.88) and adult female patients at 54.41% (95% CI: 47.3 to 61.5). A comparative analysis of the mean values of clinical and laboratory results revealed significant differences in several characteristics, including age, oxygen saturation, hemoglobin levels, fetal hemoglobin, white blood cell counts, platelet counts, and reticulocyte counts between patients with elevated ePASP and those without, in both children and adult SCD populations. Our findings regarding clinically stable SCD patients highlight a high prevalence of elevated ePASP."

This includes the evaluation of common intraoperative management issues as well as perioperative concerns related to the disease. This review will also discuss the outpatient care of sickle cell patients concerning disease-modifying agents and chronic pain management. There has been less funding for research on sickle cell disease and a relative deficit in treatment options for patients and their vaso-occlusive crises (VOC). In the chronic pain setting, adjuvants to therapy have been utilized, such as anti-inflammatories, neuropathic agents, and antihistamines; however, the mainstay of therapy for pain crises is the use of opioids. New medications for the treatment of VOCs include crinaluzimab and L-glutamine. In terms of intraoperative management, it is imperative to maintain homeostasis for the patients, and research does not show a benefit in preoperative blood transfusions when not clinically indicated. The sociopolitical context and pathophysiology of sickle cell disease make it a unique disease to manage for the practicing anesthesiologist. Tailoring management via developing a patient-specific approach to maintain homeostasis and minimize the perioperative prevalence of VOCs."

The coexistence of SLE with sickle cell trait (SCT), an inherited hemoglobinopathy prevalent among individuals of African descent, is exceptionally rare and presents significant diagnostic challenges due to overlapping clinical features. <b>Objective:</b> To describe the case of an Afro-Ecuadorian male with SLE and sickle cell trait who developed an uncommon presentation of myopericarditis and pericardial effusion. <b>Case report:</b> A 48-year-old African American male with no prior medical history presented with persistent fever, polyarticular arthralgias, and pleuritic chest pain. Investigations revealed sickle cell trait (SCT) and myopericarditis with pericardial effusion, marking the initial manifestation of SLE. Diagnostic delays occurred due to overlapping symptoms and a family history of sickle cell disease. Laboratory findings showed elevated hemoglobin S (<50%), positive ANA (1:1280, coarse speckled pattern), and anti-Smith/RNP antibodies, meeting EULAR/ACR 2019 criteria for SLE. Cardiac MRI confirmed myopericarditis. Treatment with pulse methylprednisolone, oral prednisone, and mycophenolate mofetil resulted in clinical improvement, with stable disease control on immunomodulatory therapy during follow-up. <b>Conclusions:</b> This case highlights the diagnostic complexity of SLE in patients with SCT, particularly when presenting with myopericarditis as the initial manifestation. It emphasizes the importance of a comprehensive diagnostic approach and timely initiation of immunosuppressive therapy to optimize clinical outcomes.

    "abstract": "<b>Background</b>: Sickle cell disease (SCD) individuals in India are mostly identified when they become symptomatic. To provide a timely diagnosis of SCD to participants, healthcare workers should be competent in using the point-of-care test (POCT). In this study, we aimed to evaluate the competence of healthcare workers to screen infants and adult populations through POCT. <b>Methodology</b>: This study was conducted in pilot mode over 8 months from April to November 2023. A random sampling method was used to select ten auxiliary nursing midwives (ANMs), ten lab technicians (LTs), and five medical officers (MOs). Each selected ANM and LT was supposed to conduct ten tests and MOs to conduct five tests. The POCT used to diagnose sickle cell disease was HemoTypeSC. <b>Results</b>: Among the healthcare workers who participated in the study, 67% belonged to the scheduled tribes. When the ANM and LT competencies were compared for the pre-analytical phase (phase I), ANMs were more competent than the LTs. ANMs were more adept at handling people, whereas the LTs were more competent in conducting the test procedures. When the comparison was made for the analytical phase (phase II), both the ANMs and LTs were found to be equally competent. ANMs followed the standard operating procedure (SOP) more precisely than MOs and LTs. In the post-analytical phase, LTs were found to be more competent than ANMs. The approach used in this study with sub-centers and primary health centers (PHCs) appears to have encouraged the feasibility of the screening program. <b>Conclusions</b>: The results of this study conclude that the healthcare workers in the region are competent to perform the POCT for the diagnosis of sickle cell disease.

    "abstract": "<b>Background/Objective</b>: Cobalamin (B<sub>12</sub>) deficiency is reported in 18% of adults with sickle cell disease (SCD) and only 10% without SCD; limited data are available on children. Diagnosing B<sub>12</sub> deficiency is challenging given the lack of an established gold standard method of assessment and the unique renal features of SCD. B<sub>12</sub> metabolism can be impacted by the clinical use of nitrous oxide gas (N<sub>2</sub>O), which is a standard therapy for SCD pain in some European countries. In response to emerging reports of neurologic sequalae in patients with SCD receiving N<sub>2</sub>O, we evaluated the prevalence of B<sub>12</sub> deficiency in children with SCD pain. <b>Methods:</b> Secondary analysis of prospective blood and urine samples in children aged 3-21 hospitalized with SCD pain. B<sub>12</sub> deficiency was defined as plasma methylmalonic acid (MMA) > 592 nmol/L or urine MMA/creatinine ≥ 2.2 mmol/mol. <b>Results:</b> Ninety-four children (13 ± 4 years, 54% female, 68% hemoglobin-SS, and 72% on hydroxyurea) were assessed. Further, 53% (50/94) had B<sub>12</sub> deficiency diagnosed by either urine, plasma, or both; 27% (25/94) were deficient based on urine; 39% (37/94) were deficient by plasma; and 13% (12/94) were deficient by both plasma and urine. Plasma MMA and urine MMA/creatinine did not correlate with hemoglobin or mean corpuscular volume. <b>Conclusions:</b> B<sub>12</sub> deficiency was common in children with SCD. The absence of a gold standard for diagnosing B<sub>12</sub> deficiency compounded with the reliability issues of testing modalities make it impractical to determine whether this is an over- or under-estimation of the true prevalence. Future studies to better understand the dynamics of B<sub>12</sub> metabolism during acute and steady states in SCD are warranted and could elucidate the influence of acute SCD pain on these biomarkers."

    "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) have similar clinical characteristics in the brain and islet, as well as an increased incidence with ageing and familial susceptibility. Therefore, in recent years there has been a great desire for research that elucidates how anti-diabetic drugs affect AD. This work attempts to first elucidate the possible mechanism of action of DPP-IV inhibitors in the treatment of AD by employing techniques from network pharmacology, molecular docking, molecular dynamic simulation, principal component analysis, and MM/PBSA. A total of 463 targets were identified from the SwissTargetPrediction and 784 targets were identified from the SuperPred databases. 79 common targets were screened using the PPI network. The GO and KEGG analyses indicated that the activity of DPP-IV against AD potentially involves the hsa04080 neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction signalling pathway, which contains 17 proteins, including CHRM2, CHRM3, CHRNB1, CHRNB4, CHRM1, PTGER2, CHRM4, CHRM5, TACR2, HTR2C, TACR1, F2, GABRG2, MC4R, HTR7, CHRNG, and DRD3. Molecular docking demonstrated that sitagliptin had the greatest binding affinity of -10.7 kcal/mol and established hydrogen bonds with the Asp103, Ser107, and Asn404 residues in the active site of the CHRM2 protein. Molecular dynamic simulation, PCA, and MM/PBSA were performed for the complex of sitagliptin with the above-mentioned proteins, which revealed a stable complex throughout the simulation. The work identifies the active component and possible molecular mechanism of sitagliptin in the treatment of AD and provides a theoretical foundation for future fundamental research and practical implementation."

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) remains a significant health concern, particularly in Ghana and Sub-Saharan African countries. School-based ocular screenings provide a unique opportunity for early detection of sickle cell retinopathy (SCR). Students from five major schools in the Kumasi Metropolitan District of Ghana were included. Research assistants educated students on SCD and type 1 diabetes (T1DM) during school-wide assemblies, emphasising destigmatisation and vision health. Students completed questionnaires to self-report SCD or T1DM. Those who self-reported underwent in-depth interviews and dilated fundus exams (DFE). Of 17 987 total student population, 8168 students completed the survey (45.4% response rate) of which 2.4% of students were aware of their SCD status, while most 69.3% were unaware. No students reported having T1DM. 24 students identified as having SCD (14 haemoglobin SS and 10 HbSC) resulting in a prevalence of 0.07% and 0.05% for SS and SC, respectively. Among the SCD cohort, four had Proliferative SCR (PSCR). Of the students with stage 3 PSCR, one was 15 years old with SS genotype and bilateral stage 3 PSCR; another was 18 years old with SC disease, unilateral stage 3 PSCR. Only one SCD patient (SS genotype) had a history of previous DFE. 20.8% of SCD students were aware of SCD ocular complications and 75% felt uncomfortable sharing their SCD status. We conclude (1) an alarmingly low rate of self-reporting SCD (11× and 24× lower than expected for SS and SC-SCD, respectively), (2) low health literacy given 0% of students with SC-SCD had previously undergone a DFE and (3) 17% of students had PSCR and 8% of students had treatment-warranted PSCR (stage 3). These findings highlight the need for universal SCD screening, improved health education on the ocular complications of SCD and routine school-based vision screenings for patients with SCD."

    "abstract": "Pain constitutes a significant comorbidity associated with sickle cell disease (SCD). Analgesics serve as the primary method for pain management; however, the long-term effects of these drugs on the liver of SCD patients remain not completely understood. Using real-time intravital imaging, we analyzed the effect of non-steroidal analgesics (NSA) in the liver of control and SS (SCD) mice. Remarkably, we found completely opposing effects in the liver of control and SS mice post-NSA treatment. Whereas SS mice were able to better tolerate the NSA treatment acutely compared to their littermate controls, in the long term, these mice showed delayed resolution of liver injury and exacerbated fibrosis compared to control mice. Mechanistically, we found that SS mice were protected from cytotoxicity caused by NSA at baseline due to the significant activation of hepatic Kupffer cells, which produced heme-oxygenase 1 (HO-1). HO-1 promoted the activation of the cytoprotective enzyme Cyp3A11, which inhibited hepatic damage caused by NSA. However, in the long term, depletion of hepatic Kupffer cells led to reduced expression of HO-1, which blocked the activation of Cyp3A11, resulting in fibrosis and a delay in the resolution of liver injury and inflammation. These preclinical data provide a strong proof-of-concept for HO-1 as well as Cyp3A11 as cytoprotectors against NSA-induced liver damage in the Townes model of SCD and support further development of these compounds as potential novel therapies for end-organ damage in SCD."

    "abstract": "In the United States, physicians and residents report inadequate training in managing adolescents and young adults (AYAs) during the transition from pediatric to adult care, particularly AYAs with chronic illnesses such as sickle cell disease (SCD). We developed an intervention where medical students serve as similar-aged \"peer\" mentors to offer informational and developmentally appropriate support to AYA patients during the period of transition. Our initial work showed the feasibility and acceptability of this intervention for young adults with SCD. In this report, we evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effects of this non-randomized trial on medical student mentors. Following training, medical student mentors were paired 1:1 with an AYA with SCD who was transitioning from pediatric to adult care. They conducted monthly video calls with mentees to address specific transition and disease self-management topics. Students completed baseline and follow-up surveys regarding knowledge of SCD and empathy. Satisfaction was measured at follow-up via survey and an exit interview. Nine medical students were paired with a total of 24 patients. Student retention was 100%, but only eight completed the follow-up survey. Students reported increased knowledge about managing a chronic illness and transition and improved understanding about the patient's experience navigating the healthcare system. Students expressed high satisfaction. A medical student mentor intervention was feasible and acceptable to medical students and may provide an opportunity for value-added role in medical education. Further research is needed to evaluate the efficacy of this type of intervention on both student and patient outcomes."

Multifocal tuberculosis, more common in immunocompromised patients, is rare in SC sickle cell patients, especially when localized to the sternoclavicular joint. A 44-year-old male sickle cell patient, black African, of Burkina Faso origin, with no other pathological history, presented with chronic inflammatory low back pain associated with right-sided inflammatory gonalgia and hacking cough. This symptomatology had been developing for 7 months in the context of fever and altered general condition. Examination revealed oligoarthritis of the right sternoclavicular joint and the left knee associated with pulmonary condensation syndrome and pleural effusion, a cold abscess in the right sternoclavicular joint, and a purulent fistulized right inguinal adenopathy. Biology revealed a biologic inflammatory syndrome. The GeneXpert test was positive in sputum, with no resistance to rifampin. Intradermal tuberculin test was positive. Chest CT revealed right sternoclavicular osteoarthritis and lumbar CT revealed L3-L4 spondylodiscitis. A standard radiograph of the left knee showed signs of arthritis. The diagnosis was tuberculosis with multifocal bone, pleural, and lymph node involvement. The patient was started on standard analgesics and antituberculosis drugs. The course was favorable. Multifocal tuberculosis may affect SC sickle cell patients and requires vigilance to prevent complications, especially in rare articular localizations such as the sternoclavicular joint."

Improvement in medicine has enhanced children's survival into adulthood; hence the need to transition them into adult care services. Well-transitioned patients manage the condition without undue disruptions in their quality of life. To explore the challenges faced by nurses in transitioning pediatric patients to adult care. The study adopted a phenomenological descriptive qualitative design to describe and interpret the difficulties nurses encounter when providing transition care to adolescent patients. Purposive sampling and convenience sampling methods were used to select 15 professional nurses from the pediatric department. Thematic content analysis was used to analyze the data. The interview transcripts were read to identify emerging themes and sub-themes and exported into Nvivo 12 software. Nurses working at the pediatric department of the regional health facility had no education on how to transition children from pediatric to adult care, leading to poor evidence-based transition care. In addition, there was a lack of transitional care protocol, staff training, care collaboration, transition planning, follow-up initiatives to track and monitor progress, difficulty in tracking the transition process, increased workload, and transition resource constraints. Nurses at the regional health facility have inadequate education on transitional care of adolescent patients, in-service training and workshop on transitional care on the management of patients, and formulating a policy on transitional care to guide nurses at the pediatric unit."

Red blood cell (RBC) variables may be clinically relevant as mechanistic parts or tellers of TDT pathophysiology. This is a cross-sectional study of RBC and plasma physiology in adult patients with TDT vs healthy control. TDT plasma was characterized by increased protein carbonylation, antioxidants, and larger than normal extracellular vesicles. RBCs were osmotically resistant but prone to oxidative hemolysis. They overexposed phosphatidylserine and exhibited pathologically low proteasome proteolytic activity (PPA), which correlated with metabolic markers of the disease. RBC ultrastructure was distorted, with splenectomy-related membrane pits of 300 to 800 nm. Plasma metabolomics revealed differences in heme metabolism, redox potential, short-chain fatty acids, and nitric oxide bioavailability, but also in catecholamine pathways. According to coefficient of variation assessment, hemolysis, iron homeostasis, PPA, and phosphatidylserine exposure were highly variable among patients, as opposed to RBC fragility and plasma antioxidants, amino acids, and catecholamines. Sex-based differences were detected in hemolysis, redox, and energy variables, whereas splenectomy-related differences referred to thrombotic risk, RBC morphology, and plasma metabolites with neuroendocrine activity. Hepcidin varied according to oxidative hemolysis and metabolic markers of bacterial activity. Patients with higher pretransfusion hemoglobin levels (>10 g/dL) presented mildly distorted profiles and lower membrane-associated PPA, whereas classification by severity of mutations revealed different levels of hemostasis, inflammation, plasma epinephrine, hexosamines, and methyltransferase activity markers. The currently reported heterogeneity of cellular and biochemical features probably contributes to the wide phenotypic diversity of TDT at clinical level."

    "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease has been recognized as the main cause of death in adults with sickle cell disease (SCD). Although the exact mechanism linking SCD to cardiomyopathy remains elusive, a possible role of subclinical acute transient myocardial ischemia during acute sickle cell-related vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs) has been suggested. We approached SCD cardiomyopathy by integrated omics using humanized SS mice exposed to hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R; 10 hours hypoxia followed by 3 hours reoxygenation) stress, mimicking acute VOCs. In sickle cell (SS) mice exposed to H/R, a neutrophil-driven cardiac hypertrophic response is initiated by cardiac proinflammatory pathways, intersecting proteins and micro RNA involved in profibrotic signaling. This response may be facilitated by local unresolved inflammation. We then examined the effect of 17(R)-resolvin D1 (17R-RvD1), a member of the specialized proresolving lipid mediator superfamily, administration on H/R-activated profibrotic and proangiogenic pathways. In SS mice, we found that 17R-RvD1 (1) modulates miRNAome; (2) prevents the activation of NF-κB p65; (3) protects against the H/R-induced activation of both platelet derived growth factor receptor and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1/Smad2-3 canonical pathways; (4) reduces the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-dependent proangiogenic signaling; and (5) decreases the H/R-induced proapoptotic cell signature. The protective role of 17R-RvD1 against H/R-induced maladaptive heart remodeling was supported by the reduction of galectin-3, procollagen C-proteinase enhancer-1, and endothelin-1 expression and perivascular fibrosis in SS mice at 3 days after H/R stress compared with vehicle-treated SS animals. Collectively, our data support the novel role of unresolved inflammation in pathologic heart remodeling in SCD mice in response to H/R stress. Our study provides new evidence for protective effects of 17R-RvD1 against SCD-related cardiovascular disease."

Data on demographics and family history were collected and analyzed. The screening revealed 22 cases of SCD (5.8%), 37 cases of thalassemia (9.7%), and 29 cases of G6PD deficiency (7.6%). A significant correlation was found between family history and the prevalence of these disorders. The findings highlight the need for comprehensive neonatal screening programs in tribal populations to enhance early detection and management of genetic disorders."

    "title": "Hyperactive deoxy-PIEZO1 shapes the circulatory life cycle of irreversibly sickled cells.",
    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD), affecting millions worldwide, is caused by the homozygous inheritance of the abnormal hemoglobin HbS. Deoxygenation of HbS in the venous circulation permeabilizes sickle cells to calcium via PIEZO1 channels, triggering a dehydration cascade driven by the outward electrochemical potassium gradient. This mechanism operates with particular intensity in a subpopulation of sickle red blood cells (RBCs), the irreversibly sickled cells (ISCs). The lifespan of ISCs is extremely short, about 4-7 days. Most of this time is spent in a profoundly dehydrated condition, the irreversibly sickled state, eliciting vaso-occlusion, which is considered the root cause of organ failure and pain crisis in SCD. There is a large experimental and clinical database on sickle cells and ISCs, but how ISCs form and evolve in the circulation remains a mystery. The present study is the first attempt to unravel the experimentally inaccessible life cycle of ISCs in vivo by applying a well-accredited model of RBC homeostasis and circulatory dynamics, using a vast array of validated experimental observations to tightly constrain the model parameters. The results showed that abnormally strong deoxy-PIEZO1 responses were needed for calcium to elicit a violent hyperdense collapse in ISC-destined stress reticulocytes within about a day in the circulation. The potassium-depleted ISCs remain in this maximally dehydrated but volume-stable condition, the pathogenic state, sustained by vigorous pump-leak balanced sodium fluxes. Eventually, sodium pump decay initiates rapid terminal rehydration by the unbalanced net gain of NaCl and water. Analysis of the mechanisms behind this three-stage circulatory life cycle of ISCs exposed a complex web of interactions among many components of the homeostatic fabric of RBCs. These findings point to the abnormally intense PIEZO1 response to deoxygenation in ISC-destined stress reticulocytes as a prime cause of ISC formation in vivo, a central target for future research."

    "title": "Association between Loa loa microfilaremia and anatomical hyposplenia in a rural area of the Republic of Congo: a population-based cross-sectional study.",
    "abstract": "Data suggest excess mortality is associated with loiasis, which is endemic to Central Africa, although the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. We hypothesized that there could be an association between Loa loa microfilarial densities (MFD) and lower spleen volume (SV) due to micro-obstruction linked to circulating microfilariae (mf). This could result in functional hyposplenia and a higher burden of infections. Our objective was to investigate the impact of L. loa MFD and malaria on spleen's bi-dimensional dimensions, volume, and parenchymal lesions. We included 981 participants aged 18-88 years in a cross-sectional study conducted in May-June 2022 in the Republic of the Congo. Centralized ultrasonographic examination was performed. The primary outcomes included SV, splenomegaly (cranio-caudal-distance ≥ 13 cm), and anatomical hyposplenia (AH) (SV ≤ 80, ≤ 110 or ≤ 150 cm<sup>3</sup>). Blood samples were analyzed for L. loa MFD, Plasmodium-PCR, Anti-Plasmodium falciparum-IgG, total IgM, sickle-cell disease status, and hematological abnormalities. Linear and logistic regressions were used to assess these associations. Among 981 participants, 139 (14.1%) had splenomegaly, and 26 (2.7%) and 175 (17.8%) had SV ≤ 80 and ≤ 150 cm<sup>3</sup>, respectively. L. loa microfilariae were detected in 353 (35.6%) participants. A gradient effect was observed in each model, with the highest MFD (> 30,000 mf/ml) having the highest adjusted odds ratio of 17.94 (95% CI: 2.91-110.76, P = 0.002), 5.94 (95% CI: 1.40-25.17, P = 0.016), and 5.77 (95% CI: 1.95-17.12, P = 0.002) for SV ≤ 80, 110, and 150 cm<sup>3</sup>, respectively. Anti-P. falciparum-IgG levels were gradually associated with splenomegaly. Fourteen participants met the criterion for hyper-reactive malarial splenomegaly (HMS). Conversely, higher L. loa MFD was correlated with AH, with an attributable fraction of 25%, and the presence of splenic parenchymal lesions. This study provides a detailed description of spleen morphology and the factors influencing its size in a rural central African population. It demonstrates a strong association between L. loa MFD and reduced SV, suggesting that loiasis may lead to AH, and potentially to functional hyposplenia, with consequences such as increased susceptibility to bacterial infections. Malaria was associated with splenomegaly, with a figure of HMS consistent with estimates from other African countries."

    "title": "First report of serological, molecular detection, and characterization of human parvovirus B19 infections among sickle cell anaemia patients in Khartoum State, Sudan.",
    "abstract": "Patients with haematological disorders, such as sickle cell anaemia, are at an elevated risk of transient aplastic crisis due to parvovirus B19 infection. The virus targets specific integration sites in the human genome, disrupting cellular division. However, the molecular mechanisms of infection remain poorly understood. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of human parvovirus B19 among patients with sickle cell anaemia in Khartoum State, Sudan. Ninety patients (aged <5 to >15 years) with sickle cell disease attending Gaafer Ibnouaf Children's Hospital between November 2016 and February 2017 were recruited. Sera and plasma samples were analyzed. IgG and IgM antibodies were measured using ELISA, and viral DNA was detected in plasma using nested-PCR. Phylogenetic analysis of sequenced B19 strains focused on the overlapping region of the minor (VP1) and major (VP2) capsid protein genes. Anti-parvovirus B19 IgG antibodies were detected in 57 of 90 patients (63.3 %), while IgM antibodies were present in 7 (7.8 %). Viral DNA was identified in 23 (25.5 %) patients. Among the 23 DNA-positive patients, 7 (30 %) were seronegative for both IgG and IgM antibodies, highlighting the importance of molecular diagnostics in identifying active infections, especially in early stages. Children under 5 years of age exhibited a higher nucleic acid detection rate compared to older age groups, suggesting the importance of molecular testing in younger patients particularly in the early detection of Parvovirus B19 during the acute phase of infection, before the body has developed detectable antibodies and also in immunocompromised children, who may not mount an antibody response detectable by serological methods. Phylogenetic analysis revealed two distinct Sudanese clusters: one (50 % of sequences) formed a unique clade with low similarity to existing genotypes, while the other (50 %) closely resembled genotype 1 A sequences from Iraq, Iran, and Tanzania. Parvovirus B19 antibodies and DNA were detected at high prevalence among Sudanese children with sickle cell anaemia. Screening for parvovirus B19 is critical for patients requiring blood transfusions, particularly those with haematological disorders. This study provides the first report of parvovirus B19 detection, sequencing, and characterization among Sudanese patients with sickle cell anaemia."

    "title": "Folic acid supplementation in children with sickle cell disease: a randomized double-blind noninferiority cross-over trial.",
    "abstract": "Children with sickle cell disease (SCD) in Canada are routinely supplemented with folic acid to provide sufficient folate for the increased demands of erythropoiesis. However, with the mandatory folic acid fortification of refined grains and pharmacotherapies that extend the lifespan of sickled red blood cells (RBC), this clinical practice is in question. This study aims to determine the efficacy of folic acid supplementation by measuring the effect of 12 ± 1 wk of 1 mg/d folic acid, compared with placebo, on concentrations of RBC folate (primary outcome), serum folate, and 1-carbon-related metabolites, and clinical outcomes in children with SCD. In this double-blind randomized controlled noninferiority cross-over trial, 31 children with SCD, aged 2-19 y, were enrolled and randomly assigned (1:1 with blocks of 4) to 1 mg/d folic acid, the current standard of care, or a placebo for 12 ± 1 wk. After a 12 ± 1 wk washout period, treatments were reversed. The mean [95% confidence interval (CI)] difference in endline RBC folate concentrations across treatments was -179 (-260, -99) nmol/L, with the lower boundary of the CI exceeding noninferiority but the upper boundary not (P = 0.0001; modified intention-to-treat). There was no significant difference in the number of participants who had RBC folate deficiency after each treatment (P = 0.059). No participants presented with serum folate deficiency (<7 nmol/L). There were no significant differences observed in 1-carbon metabolite concentrations (total homocysteine, S-adenosylhomocysteine, S-adenosylmethionine, vitamin B<sub>12</sub>, or methylmalonic acid), hematological measures, nor clinical outcomes (specifically acute pain episodes or megaloblastic changes) when individuals were supplemented with folic acid in comparison with placebo. Despite mandatory food fortification and advances in the medical treatment of SCD, it appears that some children with this condition may still benefit from daily folic acid supplementation. Whether this translates to improved clinical outcomes remains uncertain. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT04011345 (https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04011345)."

    "abstract": "Adenine base editing can convert sickle hemoglobin (HbS, βΕ6V) to G-Makassar hemoglobin (HbG, βE6A), a naturally occurring variant that is clinically asymptomatic. However, the quality and functionality of purified HbG and of mature HbGG and HbGS red blood cells (RBC) has not been assessed. Here, we develop a mouse model to characterize HbG. Purified HbG appears normal and does not polymerize under hypoxia. The topology of the hemoglobin fold with the βΕ6Α mutation is similar to HbA in the oxy and deoxy states. However, RBC containing HbGS are dehydrated, showing altered function and increased sickling under hypoxia. Blood counts and mitochondrial retention measures place HbGS RBCs as intermediate in severity between HbAS and HbSS, while organ function is comparable to HbAS. HbGG resembles HbAA for most metrics. Our results highlight the importance of functionally assessing the mature red cell environment when evaluating novel gene editing strategies for hematologic disorders."

    "abstract": "Premarital screening (PMS) for hemoglobinopathies, particularly thalassemia and sickle cell disease, is a public health campaign designed to reduce the prevalence of these genetic illnesses in kids. The purpose of this study was to assess knowledge and attitudes concerning PMS for hemoglobinopathies, including sickle cell anemia and thalassemia, among health college students at Qassim University. A cross-sectional methodology was employed with a standardized, self-administered questionnaire examining students' awareness and attitudes toward PMS. Participants' knowledge of sickle cell anemia and thalassemia screening was assessed, as well as their views on marrying someone who has the same genetic illness. Chi-square and analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests were used to assess the relationships between demographic characteristics, knowledge, and attitudes. This study examined knowledge and attitudes toward hemoglobinopathies PMS among 300 young adults. Participants demonstrated high knowledge levels (mean score 6.93/8, 86.7%) and positive attitudes (mean score 11.46/14, 81.9%). Knowledge was significantly higher among university-educated participants (p < 0.001). While attitudes were generally positive across demographics, older participants (26-44 years) exhibited significantly more positive attitudes than those aged 18-25 (p = 0.008). There is strong support for PMS (94.7%) and public awareness initiatives (>99%) but less agreement on marrying someone with the same genetic trait (62.5%) and less consensus on the significance of seminars (20.8%). Health college students at Qassim University have a strong understanding of PMS for hemoglobinopathies, with educational level influencing knowledge depth and attitudes. The findings indicate that additional educational programs, notably on the significance of screening in lowering genetic transmission risks, are needed. Raising public awareness through targeted seminars and media initiatives may improve the acceptability and understanding of PMS."

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is prevalent in Saudi Arabia. This study evaluates the long-term survival rates of a cohort of SCD patients. This observational cohort study was conducted at King Saud University Medical City from January 2009 to September 2023. We enrolled 223 SCD patients between 2009 and 2014, collecting comprehensive data at baseline and during follow-up. The primary endpoint was overall survival. The cohort had a median follow-up of 11.5 years, totaling 2,118 patient-years. The recent median age was 28.9 years (12.2-63.8). The survival rates at ages 20, 30, 40, and 50 years were 100%, 98.4%, 95.1%, and 89.0%, respectively, with no mortality observed before the age of 20 years. The incidence of mortality was 0.28 deaths per 100 patient-years. Among the six deaths (2.7%), causes included non-Hodgkin lymphoma, acute chest syndrome, and a sepsis-like condition, with three unknown causes. The median age of death was 36.3 years. The increased use of hydroxyurea, from 47% to 80%, was associated with reduced pain crises and acute chest syndrome, and improved hemoglobin and HbF levels. Of the patients, 43 (19.2%) were lost to follow-up, 16 (7.2%) were referred for stem cell transplant, and 16 (7.2%) were followed at other institutions. This study highlights excellent survival rates for SCD patients in our cohort. Nonetheless, the considerable loss to follow-up highlights the need for strategies to address this issue and larger multicenter studies to confirm our results."

There are currently no consensus diagnostic biomarkers for identifying individuals with SCD at risk of priapism before its occurrence. To systematically review the biochemical, hematological, imaging, genetic, and rheological parameters associated with priapism occurrence among individuals with SCD. A systematic literature search for studies investigating the association of biochemical, hematological, rheological, imaging, rheological, and genetic parameters with the occurrence of priapism in individuals with SCD was performed in the MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane databases, using the following terms: \"priapism,\" \"sickle cell,\" \"biomarker,\" \"marker,\" \"laboratory,\" \"radiographic,\" \"diagnostic,\" and \"predictive.\" A systematic review of the identified studies was conducted to describe the landscape of priapism-related biomarkers in individuals with SCD. A total of 358 studies were identified, of which 14 studies were eventually selected for evidence synthesis. The selected studies were published between 2005 and 2023, with authorship spanning five continents. We identified multiple clinical parameters investigated as potential biomarker candidates for their association with priapism occurrence in patients with SCD. We classified these into biochemical (lactate dehydrogenase, bilirubin, aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, nitric oxide metabolites, interleukin 6), hematological (hemoglobin concentration, mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, reticulocyte count, leukocyte count), genetic (Klotho, TGFBR3, QAP1, ITGAV, LNC02537, NAALADL2), rheological (red blood cell deformability, aggregation index, augmentation index), and imaging parameters. However, the results were often contradictory and do not support the clinical application of any of the investigated parameters. Several clinical and laboratory parameters have been associated with priapism occurrence in SCD; however, contradictory findings across geographical locations paint an unreliable picture of their clinical utility. Additional studies are needed to generate enough level 1 evidence in support of any of the current candidates."

    "abstract": "Allergic reactions to intravenous, alteplase have been reported, usually in doses utilized for thrombolysis. Alteplase is also widely used for clearance of occluded catheter lumens, but allergic reactions have not been reported for this route of administration. A 14-year-old patient with sickle cell disease presented with an occluded apheresis port. During alteplase dwell for port occlusion, he developed an initial reaction concerning for anaphylaxis prior to automated red cell exchange, resulting in hospitalization. Findings included angioedema to the tongue and lip as well as urticaria on his abdomen and over a previous port scar, which became warm and firm. Of note, the patient also has a history of severe atopy, uncontrolled eczema, asthma, allergic rhinitis, and elevated eosinophils. The patient was referred to allergy and a skin test to alteplase was negative. The patient underwent an alteplase challenge through his catheter where he experienced anaphylaxis. Despite appropriate treatment, he again required inpatient admission. Post reaction serum tryptase level was not elevated. A clear temporal relationship to alteplase exposure and subsequent allergic reaction was documented in this case. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of allergic reaction to intraluminal alteplase used for clearance of an occluded apheresis port. The non-elevated tryptase level suggests a non-IgE mediated reaction. Allergic reaction to alteplase dwell for clearance of occluded lumens can occur and is an entity apheresis providers should be aware of. Additionally, traditional skin testing may not be entirely predictive of safety upon rechallenge."

This study characterises the Townes mouse model of sickle cell disease (SCD) and establishes a time window in which the disease is present but does not progress significantly in terms of severity. We examined Townes mice with the HbAA, HbAS, and HbSS genotypes from young (4 weeks) to mature (5 months) stages of life to assess the disease state at different ages and any progression. We conducted blood tests, histological organ damage evaluations, and metabolic assessments to identify a suitable time frame for study based on welfare considerations. Townes HbSS mice displayed key SCD features such as anaemia, haemolysis, thromboinflammation and organ pathology. Notably, these manifestations remained relatively stable over the study period, indicating a stable phase suitable for conducting intervention studies. Mice with HbAS and HbAA genotypes served as comparative controls, showing minimal to no pathology throughout. These findings are valuable for future research on SCD and may ultimately lead to the development of more effective treatments for this debilitating disease."

Remote peer support programs have been shown to effectively improve health outcomes for many chronic conditions. The objective of this study was to examine the feasibility and acceptability of an online peer mentoring program (iPeer2Peer program) for adolescents with SCD. A waitlist pilot randomized controlled trial was conducted. Adolescents randomized to the intervention group were matched with trained peer mentors (19-25 years; successfully managing their SCD), consisting of up to 10 sessions of approximately 30-min video calls over a 15-week period. The control group received standard care. The primary outcomes were rates of accrual, withdrawal, and adherence to iP2P program/protocol, with secondary outcomes identifying topics of mentorship-mentee conversations through qualitative analysis. Twenty-eight participants (14 intervention; 14 control) were randomized to the study (mean age: 14.8 ± 1.7 years; 57% female). Accrual rate was 80% (28/35) and withdrawal rate was 18% (5/28), with 28% (4/14) adhering to the iP2P program; however, 71% (10/14) of adolescents in the intervention completed at least one call. Based on content analysis of 75 mentor-mentee calls, three distinct content categories emerged: impact of SCD, self-management, transitioning to adulthood with SCD, and general topics. The results from this pilot study suggest that the current iteration of the iP2P SCD program lacks feasibility. Future research with the iP2P program can focus improved engagement via personalized mentoring, variable communication avenues, and an emphasis on gender."

Hydroxyurea (HU), a sickle cell disease (SCD) drug approved by FDA, shows protective effect in nephropathy. This study aims to understand whether the application of HU could be effective to treat DKD. The streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice, and high glucose (HG)-treated human renal mesangial cells (HRMCs) were used to investigate the effect of HU on DKD. Serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels reflecting renal function were evaluated. Histology was used to evaluate pathological changes. Indicators of inflammation and apoptosis were detected. Lastly, the mTOR-S6K pathway was explored by detecting the protein expression of S6K and phosphorylated S6K. In STZ-induced diabetic mice, administration of HU (20 mg/kg) in drinking water for 16 weeks resulted in significant reductions in creatinine and urea nitrogen levels, alongside mitigating histopathological damage. Additionally, HU effectively suppressed the inflammatory response and apoptosis within the kidneys. HRMC cells were cultivated in HG conditions, and HU effectively attenuated the HG-induced inflammation and apoptosis. Moreover, HU treatment significantly inhibited the mTOR signaling pathway in both in both <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> experiments. This study unveils a new role of HU in alleviating diabetic kidney disease by modulating inflammation and apoptosis through the mTOR-S6K pathway. However, since HU did not significantly affect blood glucose levels, its therapeutic potential may be best realized when used in combination with standard antidiabetic therapies. Such a combination approach could simultaneously address hyperglycemia and renal dysfunction, offering a more comprehensive management strategy for DKD."

Trabecular bone score (TBS), an indicator of bone quality, is not susceptible to these challenges and may improve fracture risk prediction. A retrospective chart review was conducted in patients with Thal or SCD who had at least one spine BMD scan by DXA in the past 10 years. The most recent scan was reanalyzed for bone quality with abnormal defined as TBS <1.2. Fracture prevalence was determined by patient report with medical record validation. Patients were compared to healthy controls who participated in previous research. Data were abstracted from 126 patients with Thal (31.7 ± 11.9 yrs, 51 % Male), 170 with SCD (24.6 ± 13.5 yrs, 43 % Male), and 64 controls (25.9 ± 8.0 yrs, 17 % Male). Abnormal TBS was more common in Thal (26 %) or SCD (7 %) compared to controls (0 %, p < 0.001). Fracture prevalence was greater in Thal (36 %) compared to SCD (23 %) and controls (16 %, p = 0.005). Fragility fractures were not observed in controls but constituted 21 % of fractures in Thal and 15 % in SCD. After adjusting for age and hypogonadism, low bone mass was associated with an increased fracture prevalence (OR: 1.8, 95 % CI: 1.03, 3.23; p = 0.041), but not with fragility fracture. In contrast, abnormal TBS was strongly associated with fragility fracture after adjustment for age, sex, and BMI (OR: 11.4, 95 % CI: 2.2, 59.1, p = 0.004). Bone quality by TBS may be a valuable tool in predicting the risk of fragility fractures in young adults with hemoglobinopathies and should be considered when making decisions for anti-resorptive therapy in those with low BMD naive to fracture or where disease-specific artifacts complicate accurate spine assessment by BMD alone."

Also 3.7% of individuals had sickle cell disease, 29.8% had sickle cell trait and 0.1% was heterozygous for hemoglobin AC. The diagnostic orientation method used in our study showed a sensitivity of 100%, a specificity of 97.4%, and a negative predictive value of 100%. This method using hemogram data has proved to be valuable in areas with high resource constraints, and could be used in other areas to aid diagnostic orientation.

The incidence of infusion-related reactions, neutrophil and platelet recovery, graft failure, and immune reconstitution were compared. We found that subcutaneous alemtuzumab administration elicited fewer infusion-related reactions than intravenously administered drug (p = 0.038). No significant differences in engraftment rates, graft failure rates, infectious complications, acute GVHD, and immune reconstitution were found between the two groups. Subcutaneous administration of alemtuzumab for children undergoing transplant for sickle cell disease is safe and effective."

    "abstract": "Background Nephrotic syndrome (NS) is a common renal ailment among children, typically manifesting as a relapsing-remitting pattern. Most of the cases are managed on an outpatient basis, but a subset of patients experience complications, e.g., acute kidney injury (AKI). Although historically more prevalent in secondary NS, AKI is now occurring increasingly in children with idiopathic NS. However, the literature on AKI in this population consists of case reports and retrospective studies, particularly from India, so the study was planned to identify various risk factors that precipitate AKI in a child with NS. The secondary objective was to assess the hydration status of children having NS and its association with the development of AKI. Materials and methods This longitudinal study was conducted in the Department of Pediatrics at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Raipur, Chhattisgarh, from October 2021 to April 2023. Children of both genders and age groups between three months and 15 years, satisfying the International Society for Pediatric Neurosurgery 2021 guideline for the diagnosis of NS, were included in the study. Children having chronic kidney disease were excluded. Using the non-probability convenient sampling technique, 57 patients with NS were enrolled in the study. The patients without AKI were evaluated daily for the development of AKI using the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes 2012 guideline until day 14 or discharge and followed up for six months. Records of those children who were admitted with AKI were reviewed for possible risk factors of AKI. Data was analyzed on Epi Info software enUS version 7.3.2 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA). Categorical data were expressed as a percentage and/or 95% confidence interval (CI) of the estimate and compared using Chi-square or Fisher's exact test. A p-value ≤0.05 was considered statistically significant. The odds ratio (OR) for risk factors for AKI was determined using logistic regression. Results The mean age of the study subjects at the onset of the disease was 5.34 ± 3.66 years. The common presentations were edema (94.74%) and oliguria (80.7%). The majority (89.2%) showed a response to steroid therapy. About 56.14% of children developed AKI, and stages 2 and 3 AKI were more common, 37.5% each. About 53.12% and 46.88% of children developed pre-renal AKI and intrinsic AKI, respectively; 45.61% had hypertension at admission, with the majority having stage 1 hypertension (38.46%). Only six (10.5%) children had sickle cell trait, and all developed AKI during follow-up. Forty-two (73.68%) children had nephrotoxic drug exposure, with the most common drug being enalapril, followed by nephrotoxic antibiotics. Out of 10 children with AKI who underwent renal biopsy, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis was the most common entity (60%). The notable parameters that were found to have statistical significance for AKI were low eGFR at admission, hypertension, nephrotoxic drug exposure, inadequate water intake, fractional excretion of sodium (FeNa), and urine potassium index as markers of renal hypoperfusion, infections, steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome, and significant glomerular lesions. Conclusion The present study demonstrates an association between traditional risk factors and the causation of AKI. However, high urine osmolality, raised urine K+ index, and FeNa suggestive of raised aldosterone levels had a significant association with AKI."

    "title": "RNA-Seq and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) in Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs).",
    "abstract": "RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) and analysis methods like gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) stand at the forefront of modern molecular biology, offering unparalleled insights into gene expression dynamics and transcriptomic landscapes. In this chapter, we focus on the application of RNA-Seq technology and the GSEA method. First, we provide a real-world workflow for RNA-Seq to unravel the intricate interplay between host factors and HIV-1 infection within peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). We elucidate the core principles of RNA-Seq and its pivotal role in identifying HIV-1 restriction factors and understanding their regulatory mechanisms in PBMCs. We provide the essential steps of the RNA-Seq workflow tailored to PBMCs, encompassing sample preparation, library construction, sequencing, and advanced bioinformatics. We underscore how RNA-Seq enables precise quantification of gene expression levels, detection of alternative splicing, and exploration of novel transcripts pertinent to HIV-1 restriction. Moreover, we delve into the intricacies of HIV-1 restriction factor discovery using RNA-Seq data, shedding light on the diverse repertoire of PBMC host defense mechanisms. We discuss the challenges of RNA-Seq data analysis, including normalization, differential expression analysis, and the integration of multi-omics datasets, and propose strategies to mitigate these barriers. Next, we provide an overview of GSEA, a powerful computational method that extends beyond traditional differential gene expression analysis. This tool can provide deeper insights into the functional significance of gene expression changes. By leveraging curated gene sets representing biological pathways, molecular functions, or cellular processes, GSEA enables the identification of coordinated changes in gene expression within predefined gene sets. In our example, we applied GSEA in transcriptomic studies, highlighting its ability to uncover subtle yet coordinated changes in gene expression that may not be evident by individual gene analysis. We demonstrate how GSEA enhances our understanding of complex biological phenomena, informs hypothesis generation, and identifies potential therapeutic targets. Overall, RNA-Seq and GSEA are indispensable tools for elucidating the complex interactions in host cells altered by physiologic processes, disease states or infectious agents like HIV-1, thereby advancing our ability to identify potential targets for therapeutic interventions."

    "abstract": "Leveraging the increasing accessibility of smartphones in healthcare settings, we developed a smartphone app aimed at enhancing sickle cell disease (SCD) screening, particularly in resource-limited settings. Our application provides accurate and non-invasive SCD screening with instant results at the point-of-need. The app operates by analyzing patient fingernail images via a smartphone image to gauge anemia severity and by using targeted inquiries to identify SCD-related symptoms. These inputs collectively generate an <b>S</b>CD <b>IM</b>age and <b>P</b>atient profile-based <b>L</b>ikelihood <b>E</b>stimation (SIMPLE) score, which estimates disease probability. The accuracy of the score depends on two inputs: the patient's anemia status and their health survey responses. We tested the app on 485 pediatric patients at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta (CHOA), achieving an overall sensitivity of 74 % and specificity of 76 % in screening for SCD among children aged 6 months to 21 years. Notably, the app demonstrated enhanced performance in the target demographic, with 100 % sensitivity and 75 % specificity for screening SCD in children aged 6 months to 5 years. This cost-effective and scalable app efficiently pinpoints and stratifies individuals, particularly those who missed early screening, for formal screening programs."

    "title": "Risk Factors Associated With Osteonecrosis of the Femoral Head in Patients With Sickle Cell Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.",
    "abstract": "Osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) is a serious complication in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD), secondary to the peculiar pathophysiology of the disease. SCD is characterized by stiff and adhesive RBCs, disturbing blood circulation, and causing ischemia and microvascular damage. Understanding the key risk factors contributing to ONFH in this population is critical for developing targeted interventions to improve outcomes in this population. This study aimed to identify and analyze the key risk factors associated with osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) through a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis. This meta-analysis used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) tool to search and select the most relevant studies from electronic databases, like Web of Science, Google Scholar, PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, and MEDLINE, based on the study focus. The following medical phrases were used in the search: femoral head, aseptic necrosis, osteonecrosis, predictor, risk factor, and sickle cell disease. The study included six studies with a total of 581 participants. Four significant risk factors for ONFH in SCD were identified as follows: genotype (risk ratio: 1.09, 95% CI: 0.94-1.27), elevated hemoglobin levels (mean difference: 0.30, 95% CI: -0.03 to -0.63), hip pain (risk ratio: 1.11, 95% CI: 0.80-1.55), and acute chest pain (mean difference: 1.17, 95% CI: 0.87-1.47). Statistical analysis showed low heterogeneity across studies (I²: 0%, p < 0.05), indicating consistent findings. The ONFH group was more significantly affected by these factors than the comparator group. The meta-analysis revealed an intricate interplay of vascular, hematologic, and systemic factors contributing to ONFH of SCD with the four significant risk factors mainly genotype, elevated hemoglobin levels, hip pain, and acute chest pain. Therefore, it is important to carry out regular check-ups and focus on specific treatments to manage these clearly identified risk factors, which can help slow down the progression of the disease."

We therefore set out to study all three components of this clinical triad simultaneously (SCD, SDB, and hydroxyurea therapy), documenting correlations and suggesting underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. Hydroxyurea therapy was associated with improved SDB and with decreased inflammation, implicating the anti-inflammation effects of hydroxyurea as a plausible mechanism driving these correlations. These results underscore the need for longitudinal studies to elucidate causal relationships."

    "abstract": "The high frequency of genetic diseases compels the development of refined diagnostic and therapeutic systems. CRISPR is a precise genome editing tool that offers detection of genetic mutation with high sensitivity, specificity and flexibility for point-of-care testing in low resource environment. Advancements in CRISPR ushered new hope for the detection of genetic diseases. This review aims to explore the recent advances in CRISPR for the detection and treatment of genetic disorders. It delves into the advances like next-generation CRISPR diagnostics like nano-biosensors, digitalized CRISPR, and omics-integrated CRISPR technologies to enhance the detection limits and to facilitate the \"lab-on-chip\" technologies. Additionally, therapeutic potential of CRISPR technologies is reviewed to evaluate the implementation potential of CRISPR technologies for the treatment of hematological diseases, (sickle cell anemia and β-thalassemia), HIV, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and neurological disorders, etc. Emerging CRISPR therapeutic approaches such as base/epigenetic editing and stem cells for the development of foreseen CRIPSR drugs are explored for the development of point-of-care testing. A combination of predictive models of artificial intelligence and machine learning with growing knowledge of genetic disorders has also been discussed to understand their role in acceleration of genetic detection. Ethical consideration are briefly discussed towards to end of review. This review provides the comprehensive insights into advances in the CRISPR diagnostics/therapeutics which are believed to pave the way for reliable, effective, and low-cost genetic testing."

    "abstract": "Although catheter-related infections are the leading cause of bloodstream infections in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD), data are scarce in adult patients. The objectives of the present study were to describe central-venous-catheter-related bloodstream infections in patients with SCD and identify risk factors. We conducted a retrospective, observational study of adult patients with SCD diagnosed with central-venous-catheter-related bloodstream infections between 2011 and 2023 in two SCD reference centres. Each patient with SCD and a bloodstream infection related to a totally implantable venous access port was matched with two control patients with SCD and an infection-free totally implantable venous access port. Thirty-five (6.6%) of the 534 patients experienced a total of 69 central-venous-catheter-related bloodstream infections. Concomitant vaso-occlusive crises were observed for 81.2% of the infections. The 30-day mortality rate was 2.8%, and the infection recurrence rate was 45.7%. We observed 26 totally implantable venous access port-related bloodstream infections in 19 patients, with an incidence rate of 0.31 per 1000 catheter-days. After adjustment, the frequency of hospital admission for a vaso-occlusive crisis (odds ratio (OR) [95% confidence interval (CI)] = 1.6 [1.2-2.4]) and the presence of a psychiatric comorbidity (19.8 [4.0-148.1]) remained significantly associated with totally implantable venous access port-related bloodstream infections. Suboptimal antibiotic levels were observed in five (39%) of the 13 patients having undergone therapeutic drug monitoring. The treatment failed in four (80%) of the five patients, who presented with glomerular hyperfiltration. A central-venous-catheter-related bloodstream infection is a severe complication in adult patients with SCD and is associated with psychiatric comorbidities and severe SCD."

    "abstract": "Despite the relatively high prevalence of Sickle cell trait (SCT) in Nigeria, there has been little research into the correlates of having children with SCT among Nigerian mothers, particularly in terms of socio-demographic differentials. This study aims to investigate the maternal socio-demographic correlates of having under-five children with SCT in Nigeria. Data from the 2018 Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey (Household Person Recode and Children Recode) were merged. Mothers with at least one under-five child whose genotype was known (n = 7,493) served as the unit of analysis. Three forms of outcome variable were explored. First was the number of children with SCT by each mother. Second, the number of children with SCT was categorized as zero, one, two or more. Lastly, each mother was categorized as either having no child(ren) with SCT or having at least one child with SCT. Subsequently, we assessed multilevel Poisson, ordinal and binary logit models to identify the best fitting model using Akaike and Bayesian Information Criterion. Multilevel binary logistic regression model was identified as best fit used to identify factors associated with having children with SCT. Adjusted Odds Ratio with 95% Confidence Interval (CI) were reported as measures of association. Nearly 62% of the mothers lived in rural areas, 38.2% had no formal education and 37.4% had ever given birth to at least five children. About 26.1% (95% CI = 25.2-26.9) of the mothers had children with SCT. By geographical variation, the Northwest region had the highest proportion of mothers of under-five children with SCT. Results from the multilevel binary logistic regression revealed that women who were traditionalists (AOR = 1.77; 95% CI = 1.04-3.02) were more likely of having children with SCT. Though SCT is a genetic outcome, findings from this study suggest that important socio-demographic factors such as religion, and region of residence are significantly associated with having children with SCT in Nigeria. Sustained efforts on awareness campaigns on SCT are recommended."

    "abstract": "There has been an increasing comprehension and recognition of endocrine dysfunction among both pediatric and adult patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). Thyroid disorders can have significant clinical consequences, including growth retardation and impaired cognitive function. However, there is a disparity in the available data concerning the magnitude and spectrum of thyroid abnormalities in this population. This review aimed to provide a systematic summary and analyses on the status of thyroid function abnormalities in individuals with SCD. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, a comprehensive search was conducted across Medline/PubMed, Google Scholar, World Health Organization Virtual Health Library Regional Portal, and ScienceDirect. Pooled prevalence and standardized mean difference (SMD) estimates with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis Software version 3.3. Nineteen studies met the inclusion criteria and were incorporated into the analyses. Serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels were significantly higher in SCD patients compared to controls (SMD = 1.184; 95% CI, 0.269-2.099; p = 0.011). While non-significant, there was a trend towards lower levels of triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxin (T4), free T3, and free T4 in the SCD group (T3: SMD = -1.746; 95% CI, -3.561-0.070; p = 0.059; T4: SMD = -1.365; 95% CI, -3.030-0.300; p = 0.108; free T3: SMD = -0.384; 95% CI, -1.128-0.356; p = 0.311; free T4: SMD = -1.205; 95% CI, -2.522-0.111; p = 0.073). The pooled prevalence of hypothyroidism and subclinical hypothyroidism among SCD patients was found to be 4.9% and 8.7%, respectively. Individuals with SCD exhibit a tendency towards elevated TSH levels compared to the general population, with a subset potentially developing thyroid abnormalities, particularly subclinical hypothyroidism. Although not highly prevalent in the SCD population, monitoring thyroid function remains essential due to the potential for progression to overt hypothyroidism and its associated adverse health outcomes."

    "abstract": "Beta-haemoglobinopathies are severe genetic anemias caused by mutations that affect adult haemoglobin production. Many therapeutic approaches aim to reactivate the expression of the fetal hemoglobin genes. To this end, the CRISPR/Cas9 system has recently been used to genetically modify patients' hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells ex vivo and reactivate fetal hemoglobin expression in their erythroid progeny. More than 70 patients with severe β-thalassemia and sickle cell disease have been treated with the Casgevy® therapy. Most have achieved a significant improvement of clinical phenotype, with high editing efficiency in hematopoietic cells associated with normal or near normal hemoglobin levels. While the long-term safety and efficacy of this powerful approach still need to be evaluated, new strategies are being developed to further improve therapeutic outcomes, reduce potential genotoxicity and lower the costs of therapy."

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most common monogenic disease in the world and is caused by mutations in the β-globin gene (HBB). Notably, SCD is characterized by extreme clinical heterogeneity. Inter-individual variation in fetal hemoglobin (HbF) levels strongly contributes to this patient-to-patient variability, with high HbF levels associated with decreased morbidity and mortality. Genetic association studies have identified and replicated HbF levels-associated variants at three loci: BCL11A, HBS1L-MYB, and HBB. In SCD patients, genetic variation at these three loci accounts for ~ 50% of HbF heritability. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in non-anemic and SCD patients of multiple ancestries have identified 20 new HbF-associated variants. However, these genetic associations have yet to be replicated in independent SCD cohorts. Here, we validated the association between HbF levels and variants at five of these new loci (ASB3, BACH2, PFAS, ZBTB7A, and KLF1) in up to 3740 SCD patients. By combining CRISPR inhibition and single-cell transcriptomics, we also showed that sequences near non-coding genetic variants at BACH2 (rs4707609) and KLF1 (rs2242514, rs10404876) can control the production of the β-globin genes in erythroid HUDEP-2 cells. Finally, we analyzed whole-exome sequence data from 1354 SCD patients but could not identify rare genetic variants of large effect on HbF levels. Together, our results confirm five new HbF-associated loci that can be functionally studied to develop new strategies to induce HbF expression in SCD patients."

Cross-sectional study. Patients diagnosed with SCD and screened for SCR at an academic eye center between January 2015 and November 2022 were identified using electronic health records. Eyes of unaffected matched patients (i.e., no history of SCD, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or retinal occlusive disorder) served as controls. For each patient, demographic data, sickle cell diagnosis, types and total number of sickle cell crises, SCD medications used, ocular and systemic comorbidities, and history of intraocular treatment were extracted. A previously published DL algorithm was used to calculate retinal microvascular tortuosity using ultrawidefield pseudocolor fundus imaging among patients with SCD vs. controls. Cumulative tortuosity index (CTI). Overall, 64 patients (119 eyes) with SCD and 57 age- and race-matched controls (106 eyes) were included. The majority of the patients with SCD were females (65.6%) and of Black or African descent (78.1%), with an average age of 35.1 ± 20.1 years. The mean number of crises per patient was 3.4 ± 5.2, and the patients took 0.7 ± 0.9 medications. The mean CTI for eyes with SCD was higher than controls (1.06 ± vs. 1.03 ± 0.02, <i>P</i> < 0.001). On subgroup analysis, hemoglobin S, hemoglobin C, and HbS/beta-thalassemia variants had significantly higher CTIs compared with controls (1.07 vs. 1.03, <i>P</i> < 0.001), but not with sickle cell trait variant (1.04 vs. 1.03 control, <i>P</i> = .2). Univariable analysis showed a higher CTI in patients diagnosed with proliferative SCR, most significantly among those with sea-fan neovascularization (1.06 ± 0.02 vs. 1.04 ± 0.01, <i>P</i> < 0.001) and those with >3 sickle cell crises (1.07 ± 0.02 vs. 1.05 ± 0.02, <i>P</i> < 0.001). A DL-based metric of cumulative vascular tortuosity associates with and may be a potential biomarker for SCD and SCR disease severity.

Severe maternal mortality is increased in women with SCD, including morbidity related to the disease and other nondisease-related complications. It also can have devastating complications for fetuses, with increases in premature birth and low birth weight. This study aimed to describe the characteristics of women with SCD in South Carolina, with a specific focus on fetal and maternal outcomes and complications. The secondary aim of this study was to identify the effect of maternal characteristics on birth outcomes, including social determinants of health. A secondary analysis of women from a single institution, the Medical University of South Carolina, which was part of the registry from the multi-institutional Sickle Cell Disease Implementation Consortium, was conducted. Patient demographics, self-reported pregnancy history, hydroxyurea use, and maternal and fetal outcomes were collected from patient-reported survey data. In addition, the number of vaso-occlusive episodes surrounding their pregnancies was collected for analysis. Fifty-nine percent (116/195) of the female participants reported ever being pregnant. Seventy-two percent had live births, 15.8% had miscarriages, 1.8% had stillbirths, and 6.1% had an abortion. The mean age was 22.3 ± 4 years, with no difference in markers of severity between the groups. Most women were HbSS genotype with high rates of pain in the last year. No difference was found in age, education, employment, or income between these groups of women. Women in the nonlive birth cohort had higher body weights (78.7 versus 72.1 kg, <i>P</i> = 0.045). The Distressed Community Index was used as a marker for social determinants of health and was similar between the two groups, with a majority of both cohorts (61.7% and 52%) living in \"at risk\" and \"distressed\" communities. Complications related to SCD were high, including 43% of women experiencing pain during pregnancy, 5.2% developing acute chest syndrome, and 22.4% requiring transfusion. An additional 11% experienced preeclampsia. Unfavorable infant outcomes included 49% of the infants being premature and 40% having babies weighing less than 5.5 lb at birth. High rates of complications to both mother and infant were found in the women with SCD. Although few statistically significant predictors were found, by identifying and addressing specific needs of pregnant women with SCD, we can work toward reducing fetal and maternal mortality in an already vulnerable population."

    "abstract": "Globally, an estimated 300 million individuals have sickle cell trait (SCT), the carrier state for sickle cell disease (SCD). Although SCD is associated with increased morbidity and shortened life span, SCT has a life span comparable with that of the general population. However, \"sickle cell crisis\" has been used as a cause of death for decedents with SCT in reports of exertion-related death in athletes, military personnel, and individuals in police custody. To appraise this practice, the American Society of Hematology convened an expert panel of hematologists and forensic pathologists to conduct a systematic review of the literature relating to the occurrence of sickle cell pain crises and exertion-related mortality in people with SCT. Multiple bibliographic databases were searched with controlled vocabulary and keywords related to \"sickle cell trait,\" \"vaso-occlusive pain,\" and \"death,\" yielding 18 of 1474 citations. Independent pairs of reviewers selected studies and extracted data. We found no studies comparing uncomplicated acute pain crises in individuals with SCT and SCD. Additionally, no study was identified to support the occurrence of acute vaso-occlusive pain crises in individuals with SCT. Furthermore, this systematic review did not identify any evidence to support an association between SCT and sudden unexplained death in the absence of exertion-related rhabdomyolysis. We conclude that there are no data to support the diagnosis of acute vaso-occlusive sickle cell crisis as a cause of death in SCT, nor does the available evidence support the use of SCT as a cause of exertion-related death without rhabdomyolysis."

This study investigates the determinants of microalbuminuria in paediatric SCD patients in South-South Nigeria. This cross-sectional study was conducted over six months at the Rivers State University Teaching Hospital, Nigeria, involving 60 children with [HbSS genotype, SCD] in a steady state. Data collection included demographics, past medical history, clinical measurements, and laboratory assessments of urine and blood samples. 'Steady state' was defined as SCD with a known 'steady state' haemoglobin level and stable clinical state for ≥ 3 months. Microalbuminuria was defined spot urine albumin-creatinine ratio of 30mg/g to <300 mg/g. Of the 60 children recruited, 31 children (51.7%) were males. The mean age was 9.6 ± 4.3 years. The prevalence of microalbuminuria was 16.7% (CI: 8.29 - 28.5%) and associated risk factors were hypertension (p = 0.017), use of Hydroxyurea (p = 0.008), and Ciklavit (p = 0.025), but not NSAIDs (p = 0.046). There was a significant negative correlation (ɼ = -0.28; p = 0.032) between haemoglobin level and microalbuminuria. This study provides insights into the factors associated with microalbuminuria in children with SCD in our setting and highlights the need for early screening for markers of CKD among children with SCD. Further research is needed to ascertain the potential benefits of addressing anaemia and reducing haemolysis in mitigating the occurrence of microalbuminuria among children with SCD."

A major morbidity in sickle cell disease is the development of leg ulcers. This clinical syndrome of SCD leg ulcers (SLU) has continued to be an enigma due to its multifactorial evolution, dearth of promising guidelines on treatment, and generally unsatisfactory response to treatment. Underlying genetic susceptibilities for SLU may impact counselling, prognostication, risk of development, severity as well as response to interventions. Hence the need for this scoping review. This scoping review will collate and assess studies in English on genetic markers of SLU among all SCD age groups, genders, races, and regions. Genetic or molecular markers to be assessed among patients with sickle cell leg ulcers included, genetic markers of Inflammation, vasculopathy, tissue damage, oxidative stress, coagulopathy as well as genetic predispositions that have been studied in relation to SLUs across all countries. This includes most common biomarkers that promote development of SLU, the single nucleotide polymorphic markers (SNPs) that work through the MAPK and SMAD signaling pathway. A PubMed search of all fields for literature published in English using the strategy (sickle cell) AND (leg ulcer), and (sickle cell) AND (leg ulcer genetics) from 1998 to 2023 (last 25 years) will be undertaken.

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a global public health priority due to its high morbidity and mortality. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), effective care for this disease depends on the availability of resources and the level of knowledge of healthcare workers (HCWs). However, in Bukavu, there is limited data available on these two crucial aspects, which are vital for enhancing the care of patients with SCD. This study aims to assess the availability of SCD services and the level of knowledge of HCWs in Bukavu, DRC. A cross-sectional study based on healthcare facilities (HCFs) was carried out between March and May 2024 among 501 nurses and clinicians from 58 HCFs in Bukavu. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire with 13 knowledge questions (score >7 corresponding to good knowledge) and a checklist of available resources. Pearson's χ2 test was used to assess the association between knowledge level and participant characteristics. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to determine the factors influencing knowledge. Of the 501 participants, only 16.4% demonstrated good knowledge of SCD. Physicians were 8.4 times more likely to possess good knowledge compared to nurses (adjusted OR = 8.4; 95% CI: 4.5 - 15.9; p<0.0001). Age, clinical experience, type of HCF, attendance of SCD training, and previous management of SCD patients did not show a significant association with knowledge after adjusting for other variables (p>0.05). Regarding resources, 55.2% of HCFs had a falciform test, but none had advanced technologies such as isoelectrofocusing or high-performance liquid chromatography. This study reveals a general lack of knowledge among HCWs about SCD in Bukavu, as well as limited availability of resources for diagnosis and treatment. It is essential to improve the training of HCWs and to strengthen HCFs in order to optimize the management of SCD patients in Bukavu."

    "title": "Screening for sickle cell disease by point-of-care tests in Italy: pilot study on 1000 at risk children.",
    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a global health problem causing premature deaths and preventable severe chronic complications. A priority goal to improve outcomes both in the short and long term is the screening for early diagnosis and access to specialized care. In Italy, as in other countries, no systematic national screening program is available. A regional pilot project was developed with the aim to screen 1000 children at risk of SCD in Italy. Primary care paediatricians received point-of-care tests (POCTs) to detect abnormal haemoglobin (Hb) to be offered to children regularly followed at their own clinics. Children positive to the POCT were referred to the regional paediatric specialized centre for diagnosis confirmation and follow up. Among 1000 at risk children screened, 85 (8,5%) tested positive for an abnormal Hb. HbS trait was reported in 69 (7%) children, HbC trait in 13 (1,3%) and SCD was diagnosed in 3 (0,3% overall; 0,56% in African background) children. African family background was the most affected by sickle mutations and all children with SCD had African ancestry. Only 56/259 (22%) primary care paediatricians invited but 20/21 (95%) reception centres adhered to the pilot screening project. A screening program for SCD performed by the primary care paediatricians is feasible and relatively easy to organize. SCD affects mainly children with African family background and the scarce adherence of primary care paediatricians, in contrast to the high adhesion of charitable institutions, outlines the need for a mandatory screening for SCD, and improved awareness among health care providers. • Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is a serious global health problem that requires management in specialized centres from the first months of life. • In the absence of neonatal screening for SCD, primary health care settings represent a feasible and costeffective approach for early disease detection. • In Italy, screening for SCD performed by primary care pediatricians detected a hemoglobin variant in 8.5% children, with a disease prevalence of 0.3% in the whole population and 0.56% in children with African family background. • The poor adherence of paediatricians to the voluntary screening for SCD highlights the need for legislative interventions and training activities to ensure early diagnosis and rapid access to care for all children affected by SCD."

    "abstract": "The evolution of genetic exploration tools, from laborious methods like radiationinduced mutations to the transformative CRISPR-Cas9 system, has fundamentally reshaped genetic research and gene editing capabilities. This journey, initiated by foundational techniques such as ZFNs and TALENs and culminating in the groundbreaking work of Doudna and Charpentier in 2012, has ushered in an era of precise DNA alteration and profound insights into gene functions. The CRISPR/Cas9 system uses the Cas9 enzyme and guides RNA (gRNA) to precisely target and cleave DNA, with subsequent repair via error-prone NHEJ or precise HDR, enabling versatile gene editing. Complementary computational tools like E-CRISP and Azimuth 2.0, alongside advanced deep learning models like DeepCRISPR, have significantly contributed to refining CRISPR experiments, optimizing gRNA efficiency, and predicting outcomes with greater precision. In clinical applications, CRISPR-Cas9 shows great promise for treating complex genetic disorders like sickle cell disease and β-thalassemia, but faces challenges such as off-target effects, immune responses to viral vectors, and ethical issues in germline editing. Overcoming these challenges requires meticulous experimentation and robust regulatory frameworks to ensure responsible and beneficial utilization of the CRISPR-Cas9 technology across diverse fields, including cancer treatment, genetic disease therapies, agriculture, and synthetic biology, while continually addressing ethical, safety, and legal considerations for its advancement and widespread adoption."

    "abstract": "Systemic inflammatory diseases (SIDs) have been reported in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD), but clinical data in children are scarce. To identify clinical and laboratory features at diagnosis of SID in children with SCD and to describe their evolution. Data from children with SCD and SIDs were retrospectively collected in a French multicenter study from 1991 to 2018. Information included clinical characteristics, inflammatory markers, autoantibodies patterns, treatments, and complications. Inflammatory marker levels were compared at SID diagnosis and at the last follow-up. Statistical analyses were performed using Cran R software. Among a cohort of 3800 children with SCD, 43 SIDs were identified in 35 study participants: autoimmune liver disease (AILD, n = 13), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD, n = 7), juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA, n = 6), systemic lupus erythematosus (n = 4), autoimmune hemolytic anemia (n = 3), Sjögren syndrome (n = 1), histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (n = 2), vasculitis (n = 2), myasthenia gravis (n = 1), sarcoidosis (n = 1), idiopathic inflammatory granulomatous uveitis (n = 1), mixed connective tissue disease (n = 2). Prevalence of SID was 0.9% in our cohort of children with SCD. The median time between initial symptoms and SID diagnosis was 10 (3-20) months, notably longer in children with JIA, IBD, and Sjögren syndrome. Sixteen patients (46%) exhibited hypergammaglobulinemia (>20 g/L) at diagnosis. No significant differences were observed for other inflammatory parameters. Twenty-one children (60%) received systemic steroids and 13 (37%) biological therapies. Three patients (9%) underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Nine patients (26%) had severe infections; one died. Delayed diagnosis was frequent due to overlapping clinical presentations between SCD and SID. Clinicians must be aware of warning signs associated with elevated inflammatory markers, hypergammaglobulinemia, or specific antibodies. Therapeutic strategies remain challenging."

    "abstract": "Despite progress in healthcare services for individuals living with sickle cell disease (SCD) in Africa, substantial gaps remain in advanced treatments for SCD. To help address this burden, Tanzania has established one of the largest single-centre SCD programmes in the world and developed an advanced therapy programme for SCD focused on patient engagement and advocacy, clinical activities involving exchange blood transfusion (ExBT) and haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), gene therapy (GT) preparedness, and enabling partnerships. This report describes the programme's genesis, structure and progress achieved. Patient engagement camps and patient-focused workshops conducted since early 2021 have involved more than 150 patients, family caregivers and healthcare providers. A patient registry was established by screening 1500 patients eligible for advanced therapies with 157 identified to benefit from advanced treatments for SCD. Out of which 22 patients received ExBT, and human leucocyte antigen typing was conducted on 127 individuals to establish a registry of family members with potential to be HSCT donors. Target product profiles were devised for minimum and optimum criteria of GT products to guide drug discovery and development efforts, and qualitative research was conducted to investigate factors anticipated to influence successful adoption of GTs for SCD in Africa. The programme's multifaceted components have been enabled by institutional networks and collaborations established at national, regional and global levels. The programme presented opportunities to deliver cost-effective advanced treatment and curative options for SCD in Tanzania and lessons learnt may be applicable to inform similar efforts in other African regions where SCD is highly endemic."

    "title": "An efficient heuristic for geometric analysis of cell deformations.",
    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease causes erythrocytes to become sickle-shaped, affecting their movement in the bloodstream and reducing oxygen delivery. It has a high global prevalence and places a significant burden on healthcare systems, especially in resource-limited regions. Automated classification of sickle cells in blood images is crucial, allowing the specialist to reduce the effort required and avoid errors when quantifying the deformed cells and assessing the severity of a crisis. Recent studies have proposed various erythrocyte representation and classification methods (Jennifer et al., 2023 [1]). Since classification depends solely on cell shape, a suitable approach models erythrocytes as closed planar curves in shape space (Epifanio et al., 2020). This approach employs elastic distances between shapes, which are invariant under rotations, translations, scaling, and reparameterizations, ensuring consistent distance measurements regardless of the curves' position, starting point, or traversal speed. While previous methods exploiting shape space distances had achieved high accuracy, we refined the model by considering the geometric characteristics of healthy and sickled erythrocytes. Our method proposes (1) to employ a fixed parameterization based on the major axis of each cell to compute distances and (2) to align each cell with two templates using this parameterization before computing distances. Aligning shapes to templates before distance computation, a concept successfully applied in areas such as molecular dynamics (Richmond et al., 2004 [2]), and using a fixed parameterization, instead of minimizing distances across all possible parameterizations, simplifies calculations. This strategy achieves 96.03% accuracy rate in both supervised classification and unsupervised clustering. Our method ensures efficient erythrocyte classification, maintaining or improving accuracy over shape space models while significantly reducing computational costs."

    "abstract": "Babesiosis in sickle cell disease (SCD) is marked by severe anemia but the underlying red blood cell (RBC) rheologic parameters remain largely undefined. Here, we describe altered RBC deformability from both primary (host RBC sickle hemoglobin mediated) and secondary changes (Babesia parasite infection mediated) to the RBC membrane using wild-type AA, sickle trait AS, and sickle SS RBCs. Our ektacytometry analysis demonstrates that the changes in the host RBC biomechanical properties, before and after Babesia infection, reside on a spectrum of severity, with wild-type infected AA cells, despite showing a significant reduction of deformability under both shear and osmolarity gradients, exhibiting only a mild phenotype, compared with infected AS RBCs that show median changes in deformability and infected SS RBCs that exhibit the most dramatic impact of infection on cellular rheology, including an increase in point of sickling values. Furthermore, using ImageStream cytometric technology to quantify changes in cellular shape and area along with a tunable resistive pulse sensor to measure release of extracellular vesicles from these host RBCs, before and after infection, we offer a potential mechanistic basis for this extreme SS RBC rheologic profile, which include enhanced sickling rates and altered osmotic fragility, loss of RBC surface area, and hypervesiculation in infected SS host RBCs. These results underline the importance of understanding the impact of intraerythrocytic parasitic infections of SCD RBCs, especially on their cellular membranes and studying the mechanisms that lead to hyperhemolysis and extreme anemia in patients with SCD."

This single-center retrospective observational study was conducted on consecutive pregnant women with SCD between January 2018 and December 2020. All the pregnant women with SCD were included in this study. Sickler women carrying sickle cell traits (HbAS, HbAC), multiple pregnancy, or other medical diseases were excluded from the study. We used non-random, convenience sampling and collected their demographic details, medical history, course of SCD before & during pregnancy, maternal/fetal outcome, laboratory parameters, and other information using the questionnaire. Patients were sub-grouped into three according to blood transfusion categories (therapeutic, prophylactic, or not transfused) during the pregnancy. Descriptive data were represented as numbers and mean ± SD values. The medical and obstetrical complications and fetomaternal outcomes among the three groups were analyzed by Chi-square/Fisher's Extract test. The study included 62 patients, 37 were in the therapeutic group, 11 were in the prophylactic group, and 14 were in the non-transfusion group. Hemolytic crises, painful crises, acute chest syndrome, pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH), preeclampsia, preterm births, intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR), and neonatal ICU admission were significantly lower among the prophylactic group (P = 0.000, p = 0.000, p = 0.001, p = 0.002, p = 0.009, p = 0.007, p =0.001 & p= 0.016 respectively) compared with other two groups. Our study demonstrates that prophylactic blood transfusion in SCD positively alters the course of pregnancy by reducing fetomaternal complications."

    "abstract": "Non-myeloablative hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is a curative option for individuals with sickle cell disease (SCD). Our traditional goal with this approach has been to achieve a state of mixed donor/recipient chimerism. Recently, we reported an increased risk of hematologic malignancies (HMs) in adults with SCD following graft failure or mixed chimerism. To evaluate the origin of HMs, we performed chimerism analyses of 5 patients with SCD who developed HMs after non-myeloablative HCT. DNA was extracted from sorted peripheral blood or bone marrow cells representing mature cell lineages or leukemic blasts and subjected to chimerism analysis by PCR amplification of polymorphic short tandem repeats. Unlike mature cell lineages in patients with mixed chimerism, which still showed a donor-derived fraction of cells, leukemic blast cells were found to be 99-100% recipient-derived in all patients. Non-myeloablative conditioning allows for the survival of patients' cells that might harbor pre-leukemic clones that possess the capacity to evolve under genotoxic or environmental stress into malignancies; therefore, we have modified our HCT protocols with the goal of full donor chimerism to mitigate the risk of HM development."

    "abstract": "Sickle cell anemia (SCA) is one of the known hemoglobinopathies that result in red blood cell (RBC) destruction, among other complications. There are factors that make SCA an environment for autoimmune disease (AID). They include chronic inflammation, immune-mediated processes involved in SCA complications, and susceptibility to infections. Furthermore, immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a complex disorder characterized by immune imbalance that results in platelet destruction. We report a case of a 20-year-old patient with SCA presenting with a vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) and unexplained thrombocytopenia. After ruling out secondary causes of the latter condition, the patient was challenged with steroid therapy. Interestingly, he showed a dramatic response in platelet count. This report emphasizes the potential role of SCA in the development of ITP and encourages further studies to explore the underlying immunological mechanisms."

There are few reports of their co-existence in Western literature and a paucity of reports in Sub-Saharan Africa. Their co-existence is associated with diagnostic delay and treatment dilemmas. The aim is to describe the clinical, laboratory, and treatment profile of Nigerian lupus with sickle cell disease. A 7-year retrospective descriptive study of lupus patients with sickle cell disease was performed. Medical records of eligible patients were extracted into a proforma, transferred into SPSS, and analyzed with descriptive statistics. Sociodemographic, clinical, laboratory, and treatment data were presented as frequency and percentages. Twelve SLE-SCD cases (female 11, male 1) were identified. The mean age was 28.5 years and the mean duration of illness prior to diagnosis was 9.5 years. The median follow-up period was 3.1 years and the common presentations were mucocutaneous (66%), renal, (50%) serositis (33%), and neurological (16%) in decreasing order. All had anemia and positive antinuclear antibody, 33% had pancytopenia and 75% had positive anti-dsDNA and anti-Smith. Two are on maintenance hemodialysis, one with interstitial lung disease, and one on long-term anticoagulation due to deep vein thrombosis. Sickle cell disease and SLE should be considered in SCD with atypical clinical and laboratory features. We hope this report will raise diagnostic suspicion and prompt early diagnosis and treatment to prevent multiorgan damage that may ensue from such an association."

Several federal partners collaborated with the Sickle Cell Disease Treatment Demonstration Program (SCDTDP) grantees to develop and test a national Project ECHO telementoring program targeting primary care providers (PCPs). Federal partners developed an extensive recruitment and outreach strategy to engage PCPs in the Sickle Cell Disease Training and Mentoring (STAMP) virtual educational (telementoring) program using a multi-pronged recruitment strategy. The SCDTDP grantees created a tailored curriculum of didactic presentations about the management of SCD, especially for PCPs. STAMP hosted 12 sessions over 6 months. Despite the multi-pronged recruitment strategy and tailored curriculum, there were very few PCPs among the 763 attendees. The majority of attendees were hematologists and other community-based advocates with a vested interest in SCD. Despite a federal partnership, the STAMP outreach strategy was unsuccessful in recruiting PCPs to participate in a virtual telementoring education program designed to increase access to care for adults with SCD. STAMP's attendee participation and the lack of engagement by PCPs were unable to significantly show an increase in interest or willingness by PCPs to learn to co-manage SCD care with specialists."

    "abstract": "Lung tissue from human patients and murine models of sickle cell disease pulmonary hypertension (SCD-PH) show perivascular regions with excessive iron accumulation. The iron accumulation arises from chronic hemolysis and extravasation of hemoglobin (Hb) into the lung adventitial spaces, where it is linked to nitric oxide depletion, oxidative stress, inflammation, and tissue hypoxia, which collectively drive SCD-PH. Here, we tested the hypothesis that intrapulmonary delivery of hemopexin (Hpx) to the deep lung is effective at scavenging heme-iron and attenuating the progression of SCD-PH. Herein, we evaluated in a murine model of hemolysis driven SCD-PH, if intrapulmonary Hpx administration bi-weekly for 10 weeks improves lung iron deposition, exercise tolerance, cardiovascular function, and multi-omic indices associated with SCD-PH. Data shows Hpx delivered with a micro-sprayer deposits Hpx in the alveolar regions. Hpx extravasates into the perivascular compartments but does not diffuse into the circulation. Histological examination shows Hpx therapy decreased lung iron deposition, 4-HNE, and HO-1 expression. This was associated with improved exercise tolerance, cardiopulmonary function, and multi-omic profile of whole lung and RV tissue. Our data provides proof of concept that treating lung heme-iron by direct administration of Hpx to the lung attenuates the progression of PH associated with SCD."

    "abstract": "Anesthesiology, the medical specialty that deals with the management of vital functions in patients undergoing surgery, has played an important role in the successful development of cardiac interventions worldwide. Tracing the historical roots of cardiac anesthesia and critical care from its inception in the late 1950s, a paradigm shift in perioperative care has been driven by a better understanding of the mechanisms of organ dysfunction in stressful conditions and technological advances regarding surgical approach, patient monitoring, and organ protection. Although progress in cardiac anesthesia and critical care lagged a little behind in Caribbean territories, successful achievements have been accomplished over the last forty years. Compared with Western countries, the greater prevalence of obesity, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension as well as specific diseases such as cardiac amyloidosis, sickle cell anemia, rheumatic heart disease, and tropical infections may reduce a patient's physiologic reserve and increase the operative risk among the multi-ethnic population living in the French West Indies and Guiana. So far, cardiac anesthesiologists at the University Hospital of Martinique have demonstrated their abilities in implementing evidence-based clinical care processes and adaptating to efficiently working in a complex environment interacting with multiple partners. Attracting specialized physicians in dedicated cardiac surgical centers and the creation of a regional health network supported by governmental authorities, insurance companies, and charitable organizations are necessary to solve the unmet needs for invasive cardiac treatments in the Caribbean region."

Genetic variations in hemoglobin chains, such as those underlying sickle cell disease and thalassemias, present substantial clinical challenges. Here, we review the progress in research, including the use of allosteric modulators, pharmacological chaperones, and antioxidant treatments, which has begun to improve hemoglobin stability and oxygen affinity. According to UniProt (as of 7 August 2024), 819 variants of the α-hemoglobin subunit and 771 variants of the β-hemoglobin subunit have been documented, with over 116 classified as unstable. These data demonstrate the urgent need to develop variant-specific stabilizing options. Beyond small-molecule drugs/binders, novel protein-based strategies-such as engineered hemoglobin-binding proteins (including falcilysin, llama-derived nanobodies, and α-hemoglobin-stabilizing proteins)-offer promising new options. As our understanding of hemoglobin's structural and functional diversity grows, so does the potential for genotype-driven approaches. Continued research into hemoglobin stabilization and ligand-binding modification may yield more precise, effective treatments and pave the way toward effective strategies for hemoglobinopathies."

SDB has been systematically reviewed; therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis focused on sleep behaviour. <b>Methods:</b> The comprehensive literature search, following PRISMA reporting guidelines, included all languages, conference proceedings and published theses from inception through February 2022. We identified 31 studies, with most of the research being conducted in North America, using polysomnography, actigraphy and questionnaires/diaries in paediatric SCD cohorts. <b>Results:</b> Total sleep time (TST) decreased, while sleep onset latency (SOL) increased with age. TST was higher on self-reported sleep diary measures and lower on polysomnography (PSG) and actigraphy assessments. SOL was lowest during PSG and highest in actigraphy. The discrepancy between sleep measures might be due to the overestimation of sleep behaviour by parents. In six studies, TST and SOL were compared between people living with SCD and healthy controls; in four, TST was longer in those living with SCD while it was shorter in two. Meta-analyses on the effect of TST and SOL were limited due to publication bias, with heterogeneity between the studies, in part related to measurement differences. No significant differences were found. <b>Conclusions:</b> The scarcity of case-control studies and significant heterogeneity in findings likely attributable to variations in sleep assessment methodologies. Gaps in the literature should be addressed."

We aimed to describe sociodemographic data and evaluate the quality of life (QoL) of SCD patients with and without SLUs. We conducted a cross-sectional study including 13 SCD patients with SLUs and 42 without LUs. Clinical data were obtained by reviewing the medical records, and QoL was assessed with the WHOQOL-BREF questionnaire. Our cohort of patients had a mean age of 34.9 years, with 52.8% male, 52.8% identifying as black, and 41.7% identifying as brown. Most had low income, incomplete education, and high unemployment rates. The social habits and relationships of SCD patients showed varying levels of friendship and family closeness, and the majority of SLU+ patients did not practice sports. We failed to find statistical differences in the WHOQOL-BREF domains between SLU+ and SLU- patients. However, higher income and employment status were associated with improved WHOQOL-BREF domain scores in SCD patients, while vaso-occlusive episodes and female gender were linked to lower scores. Our data reinforce the sociodemographic characteristics of SCD. The physical domain was associated with income, occupation, and vaso-occlusion. The psychological domain was associated with income and occupation. The social relationship domain was associated with occupation and female gender. The environmental domain was associated with vaso-occlusion. The WHOQOL-BREF is a reliable tool to measure QoL in SCD."

    "abstract": "Blood donation plays a critical role in healthcare systems by supplying blood and blood products for surgeries, emergency care, and chronic disease management. In Saudi Arabia, the prevalence of genetic disorders, like sickle cell disease and thalassemia, further increase the need for a stable blood supply. However, high rates of donor deferrals remain a significant barrier to maintaining a reliable blood supply. This study aims to analyse the main factors contributing to blood donor deferrals at King Fahad Hospital Al Hofuf between January 2023 and August 2024. By identifying and correlating key deferral reasons with donor demographics, the study seeks to provide actionable insights to reduce deferral rates and enhance donor retention. This retrospective observational study analysed blood donation records of 21,149 donors, including both eligible and deferred individuals. Demographic data (age, gender, nationality) and medical assessments (hemoglobin levels, blood pressure) were collected and analysed to identify deferral trends. Descriptive and inferential statistics were applied to assess the relationships between donor characteristics and deferral reasons, with chi-square tests and logistic regression used to identify predictors of deferral. Data analyses showed that 89.5% of deferred donors were male, with the largest group of deferrals aged 21-30 years. Low hemoglobin was the most common deferral reason, affecting 27.5% of all deferred donors, with female donors disproportionately affected by anemia-related deferrals. Male donors were more frequently deferred for aspirin use (13.2%) and blood pressure issues (15.9%). Seasonal trends showed deferral peaks in January and November, while the highest donation rates were recorded in April and October. Addressing the higher rates of deferral due to low hemoglobin and cardiovascular issues through targeted public health interventions could significantly improve donor retention and ensure a more reliable blood supply. Implementing iron supplementation programs for female donors and cardiovascular health screenings for male donors could reduce deferral rates."

Intermittent capillary perfusion at the FAZ border was also identified using sequential registered OCT-A scans. Perivascular and quadrant-based capillary densities were significantly lower in SCD groups (Kruskal-Wallis tests; P < 0.001) with preferential sites of capillary nonperfusion occurring along periarteriolar aspect of the vascular bed and at the temporal aspect of the fovea. FAZ perimeter and acircularity index were significantly higher in SCD groups (Kruskal-Wallis tests; P ≤ 0.05). However, no significant differences in FAZ area between unaffected control and SCD groups were observed (Kruskal-Wallis test; P = 0.08). The number of capillary segments with intermittent perfusion was higher in the SCD groups. Our findings suggest that the periarteriolar aspect of the vascular bed is the preferential site of retinal capillary occlusion in patients with SCD with more involvement of the temporal aspect of the parafovea."

    "title": "Factors predicting manipulation under anaesthesia after total knee replacement.",
    "abstract": "Manipulation under anesthesia (MUA) is a standard and effective treatment to correct stiffness and improve range of motion (ROM) following total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Delayed MUA has been associated with increased rates of revision surgeries and infections. Early MUA has been shown to double the mean gain in flexion compared to delayed interventions. To identify candidates early and effectively, this study aimed to evaluate various risk factors influencing the likelihood of undergoing MUA after TKA using statistical analysis. Data from 1973 to 2023 were collected from TriNetX, reviewing 245,567 unique patients. Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes identified those who had undergone TKA and MUA. ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes identified preoperative comorbidities and complications. Univariate and multivariate analyses assessed the association between preoperative risk factors and MUA likelihood. Independent sample t-tests, Levene's test, and effect size analyses examined age differences between MUA and non-MUA cohorts. The study included 6,867 patients (2.8%) in the MUA cohort and 238,700 patients (97.2%) in the non-MUA cohort. Among 245,567 TKA patients, 6,867 (2.8%) required MUA. Univariate analysis showed significant associations with age < 65 (OR = 2.49 [CI: 2.37-2.61], p < 0.001), Black race (OR = 2.04 [CI: 1.91-2.18], p < 0.001), SCD (OR = 2.96 [CI: 2.01-4.35], p < 0.001), and cannabis-related disorders (OR = 2.38 [CI: 1.29-4.38], p = 0.004). Multivariate analysis confirmed significant predictors: age < 65 (OR = 2.39 [CI: 2.26-2.53], p < 0.001), Black race (OR = 1.65 [CI: 1.51-1.81], p < 0.001), SCD (OR = 1.51 [CI: 1.00-2.26], p = 0.048), and female sex (OR = 1.13 [CI: 1.07-1.18], p < 0.001). The average age was 61.94 years in the MUA cohort and 67.09 years in the non-MUA cohort, with a significant mean difference of 5.14 years (p < 0.001). Our study demonstrates that younger age, female sex, and Black race are significant predictors of MUA after TKA. Additionally, novel risk factors such as peripheral artery disease (PAD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and sickle cell disease (SCD) were identified, with SCD notably increasing the likelihood of MUA. This study uniquely highlights reduced likelihoods of MUA in PAD and CKD patients, contrasting with prior literature. The significant association of SCD with MUA, alongside these novel findings, emphasizes the value of demographic and comorbidity-specific predictors in refining postoperative risk stratification."

    "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate pain characteristics, opioid misuse prevalence, and the relationship between healthliteracy and pain catastrophising in patients with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD). This was a cross-sectional study. Data were collected from patients with SCD in Oman. Validated tools were used to assess pain (Brief Pain Inventory), healthliteracy (HLS-Q12), opioid misuse (Current Opioid Misuse Measure [COMM]), and pain catastrophising (Pain Catastrophising Scale). The study included 169 patients with SCD, with an average age of 34.4 (SD = 12.9) years, of whom 51.5% werefemale. A total of 79.3% of the participants reported experiencing pain, with an average total pain score of 3.8 (SD = 2.6).Additionally, 74% of the patients were identified as being at risk of opioid misuse. The risk of opioid misuse was positivelyassociated with pain catastrophising (r = 0.302, p < 0.001) and negatively associated with health literacy (r = -0.220, p = 0.005). Pain severity and interference are also linked to the risk of opioid misuse. Sociodemographic factors, such as age, sex, and education, showed no significant association with the risk of opioid misuse. Patients with SCD face high rates of chronic pain and considerable risk of opioid misuse. Psychological factors, particularly pain catastrophising and lower healthliteracy, were strongly associated with misuse risk, while sociodemographic factors had less impact. These findings highlight the need for targeted interventions addressing psychological support and health literacy to reduce opioidmisuse in SCD patients. Healthcare providers should integrate pain management strategies with educational programs to enhancehealth literacy and mitigate the psychological burden of pain."

    "title": "Sickle Cell Anemia and Inflammation: A Review of Stones and Landmarks Paving the Road in the Last 25 Years.",
    "abstract": "A quarter of a century ago, sickle cell disease (SCD) was mainly viewed as a typical genetic disease inherited as a classical Mendelian trait. Therefore, the main focus concerning SCD was on diagnosis, meaning, genotyping, and identification of homozygous and heterozygous individuals carrying the relevant HbS mutant allele. Nowadays, it is well established that sickle cell disease is indeed the result of homozygosis for the HbS variant, although this single feature is not capable of explaining the highly diverse clinical presentation of SCD. In fact, an important feature of SCD is the chronic inflammation that accompanies the sickling of erythrocytes. In this manuscript, we will revisit the early evidence of inflammation in SCD and review what was uncovered during the last 25 years. Here, we describe Sickle cell anemia as a major participant in the history of science. In fact, SCD was the first genetic disease where the causal mutation was identified and is also the first disease for which treatment through genome editing was approved, making this disease a landmark in the road of molecular biology."

This study describes RBC utilization in an SCD cohort at a single Canadian center. All adults with SCD who received care at the Ottawa Hospital between January 2006 and May 2019 were included, and followed until December 2021. Data on hospital encounters and RBC transfusions were obtained from hospital databases. Overall, 273 patients were included (median age: 25 years; 53.8% female; median follow-up: 8.1 years). During the study period, there were 23,127 hospital encounters (median: 45 [interquartile range (IQR) 18, 100] per patient), with 165 patients (60.4% of cohort) receiving 22,538 RBC units. Most RBC units (86.5%) were transfused in the outpatient setting. Although only 2.9% of patients had O-negative blood type, O-negative RBC units accounted for 29.1% of units transfused. One hundred forty-seven patients received 2205 RBC units (9.8% of total) as simple transfusions (median: 5 [IQR 3, 13] per patient), and 88 patients received 20,333 RBC units (90.2% of total) during 2702 red cell exchange (RCE) sessions (median: 14.5 (IQR 1, 47.5) RCE per transfused patient). A median of 7 RBC units (IQR 6, 9) were transfused per RCE session, with a median of 30 days (IQR 28, 40) between sessions. Patients with SCD at our center frequently received O-negative units, and large RBC volumes were used for RCE. These results provide a utilization baseline for future education and quality improvement initiatives to optimize RBC stewardship."

    "abstract": "Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) is an important glycoprotein of the human innate immune system. Furthermore, individuals with sickle cell anemia (SCA) and MBL deficiency seem more susceptible to vaso-occlusive crises, suggesting an MBL role on HbSS red blood cells (RBCs). This study investigated the interaction of MBL with HbA (healthy) and HbSS RBCs using optical tweezers (OT) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). OT was employed to measure the RBC overall elasticity, while AFM was applied to assess the local stiffness and roughness of the cell membrane. Osmotic fragility assays were also performed. Additionally, cationic quantum dots (QDs) were applied to evaluate the membrane charges of HbSS RBCs. Results using QDs indicated that HbSS RBCs have a less negatively charged surface than HbA RBCs, potentially due to a reduced sialic acid content. Osmotic fragility assays showed that MBL enhanced the resistance of RBCs to lysis, while OT and AFM indicated a decrease in their elastic capacity following MBL incubation. Moreover, OT and membrane roughness results suggested a greater interaction of MBL with HbSS RBCs. We believe this study provided insights into the MBL interaction with HbSS RBCs, inciting further investigations to better understand its involvement in SCA pathophysiology in vivo."

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most common genetic disease in the world and a societal challenge. SCD is characterized by multiorgan injury related to intravascular hemolysis. To understand tissue-specific responses to intravascular hemolysis and exposure to heme, we present a transcriptomic atlas of the primary target organs of hemoglobin S (HbSS) vs hemoglobin 1 (HbAA) transgenic SCD mice. We explored the transcriptomes of the liver, kidney, heart, lung, and bone marrow from HbAA and HbSS Townes littermates at resting state and their changes after the injection of heme, assessed by RNA sequencing. Inflammation and myeloid cell signatures were omnipresent in resting HbSS organs, with the liver being the most affected. The injection of heme triggered a robust inflammatory response in HbAA mice. Signatures of exposure to heme in HbAA mice were downstream of toll like receptor 4, sensor of lipopolysaccharides but also of heme, interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-6, and interferon gamma, similarly to HbSS mice at rest. Nevertheless, HbSS mice were strikingly unresponsive to the heme administration, irrespective of the organ. This tolerance was driven by upregulation of the heme-detoxifying enzyme heme oxygenase-1 and was abrogated by its specific inhibition. Therefore, HbSS mice develop robust protective mechanisms, which may explain how they and patients with SCD survive bouts of severe hemolysis."

To evaluate the level of awareness and acceptance of NBS for SCD and the determinant factors influencing caregivers in Gwagwalada Area Council of the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, Nigeria. The study employed a descriptive, quantitative design using questionnaires administered to healthcare workers and caregivers at immunization and antenatal clinics of 10 selected Primary Healthcare Centers (PHC) in Gwagwalada Area Council of the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, Nigeria. A total of 357 participants, comprising 301 caregivers and 56 health care workers responded to the questionnaires. Among the caregivers, 171 (57.2%) were not aware of NBS for SCD. Two hundred and ninety (97%) expressed willingness to participate in the NBS. However, 32 (10.6%) indicated reluctance to accept positive results of SCD. The majority, 175 (59.1%) of the caregivers strongly agreed that NBS for SCD helps in the early detection and management of SCD, while 7 (2.4%) disagreed. Notably 272 (90.4%) of the caregivers had secondary and tertiary education. Among the healthcare workers, 39 (73.6%) were aware of NBS for SCD and 30 (73.2%) have recommended it to caregivers. This study revealed a low level of awareness of NBS for SCD among caregivers. However, there was a high level of acceptance among them. The level of awareness is high among healthcare workers. Education emerged as the major factor determining the knowledge and attitude of caregivers toward NBS for SCD."

    "abstract": "Renal medullary carcinoma (RMC) is a highly aggressive malignancy defined by the loss of the SMARCB1 tumor suppressor. It mainly affects young individuals of African descent with sickle cell trait, and it is resistant to conventional therapies used for other renal cell carcinomas. This study aimed to identify potential biomarkers for early detection and disease monitoring of RMC. Integrated profiling of primary untreated RMC tumor tissues and paired adjacent kidney controls was performed using RNA sequencing and histone chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing. The expression of serum cancer antigen 125 (CA-125), was prospectively evaluated in 47 patients with RMC. Functional studies were conducted in RMC cell lines to assess the effects of SMARCB1 reexpression. MUC16, encoding for CA-125, was identified as one of the top upregulated genes in RMC tissues, with concomitant enrichment of active histone marks H3K4me3 and H3K27ac at its promoter. Elevated serum CA-125 levels were found in 31 of 47 (66%) patients with RMC and correlated significantly with metastatic tumor burden (P = 0.03). Functional studies in RMC cell lines demonstrated that SMARCB1 reexpression significantly reduced MUC16 expression. The correlation between serum CA-125 levels and metastatic burden suggests that CA-125 is a clinically relevant biomarker for RMC. These findings support further exploration of CA-125 for disease monitoring and targeted therapeutics in RMC."

Timely identification of these disorders is critical to reduction in severe clinical manifestations and for identifying disease burden. Present study reports spectrum of hemoglobinopathies among the referred anemia patients to single centre in central India. All individuals referred to the institute from 1st January 2012 to 31st August 2020 for diagnosis were included in the study. Demographic details, clinical and transfusion history were obtained. Hemoglobin electrophoresis or High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (Variant II, Bio-Rad) was performed to identify the type of hemoglobinopathy. Molecular characterization of unknown or rare variants was performed wherever necessary. During the study period 13,587 individuals were screened. Homozygous beta thalassemia was observed in 0.6% of the patients, whereas SCD was observed in 12% of the patients. Seventy-four individuals have either hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin (HPFH) or delta beta thalassemia. More than 50% of SCD patients referred were over the age of 12 years. SCD disease was more common among Pradhan, Gond and Baiga tribes whereas HPFH and delta beta thalassemia was found among Other socially and educationally backward classes. High occurrence of hemoglobinopathies in central India warrants the need of large scale screening in highly prevalent communities for its prevention."

    "abstract": "The heterogeneity in clinical presentations in sickle cell disease (SCD) alters between crisis and steady state phases. Considering the pathophysiology, it is crucial to establish a disease-specific reference interval for hematological and biochemical parameters and identify the sensitive predictive markers for crisis. The case-control study included fifty-four healthy control, forty SCD cases in crisis state, and forty-six steady state cases. Blood samples were evaluated for complete blood count (CBC) and biochemical parameters. Red cell indices were calculated. 2.5th and 97.5th percentile values were delineated in the steady state cases as new reference interval. The new cut-off values were evaluated for sensitivity and specificity. The steady state cases reported a significant decrease in urea, sodium, Hb, Hct, and RBC count compared to the control group, whereas potassium, and red cell indices were higher. Compared to the steady state, the crisis state depicted a significant increase in urea, liver enzymes, leucocytes, inflammatory indices, and all red cell indices, whereas sodium, albumin, iron, Hb, Hct, and LMR were decreased. The revised 95 percentile ranges were sodium-132.35-143.65 mmol/L, potassium-3.75-6.09 mmol/L, albumin-2.9-5.0 g/dL, Hb-7.51-12.17 g/dL, RBC count-2.2-5.49 × 10<sup>6</sup>/µL, and Hct-22.54-36.1%. Red cell indices like Ricerca, Green and King, and Huber-Heklotz could be good screening tools for crisis events with more than 70% sensitivity. Thus, the laboratory must derive a new reference interval and cut-off values at the steady state in the SCD population it is catering samples rather than comparing it with normal healthy individuals.

We analyzed Pandemic Recovery Survey data via multivariable logistic regression to compare blood test delays between individuals with and without medical conditions, while adjusting for sociodemographic factors. We also examined the disease burden using disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and summary exposure values (SEV) rates. Our findings indicate profound disparities, with over 60% of respondents in Egypt, Nigeria, and India reporting they have never undergone blood tests. Individuals with existing medical conditions are significantly more likely to experience delays in blood work. There is a pronounced gap in blood work accessibility, particularly in countries with high disease burdens. Findings suggest an urgent need for interventions to improve routine blood test access for high-risk populations to reduce the underdiagnosis of significant medical conditions. Prioritizing timely and accessible blood testing can serve as a step towards mitigating healthcare disparities."

The objective of the study was to explore perceptions and ethical dilemmas surrounding prenatal screening for sickle cell disease and subsequent termination of pregnancy among pregnant women and key stakeholders from the tribal region of Gujarat. The study employed sequential mixed-methods research, embedding a participatory research approach. Pregnant women and key stakeholders from Jhaghadia, Bharuch District of Gujarat were interviewed. The qualitative data was analyzed using a thematic analytic framework, and the quantitative data was presented with descriptive statistics. Findings revealed key themes such as knowledge about SCD and its management, knowledge about PNS, barriers to PNS, acceptance of PNS and ethical dilemmas related to the termination of pregnancy (TOP). The results show a mixed preference for prenatal screening from both qualitative and quantitative data, primarily due to the complex decision-making process. Couples with SCD reported a high preference for PNS and TOP if the foetus had sickle cell disease whereas couples living with SCD trait were assigned lowest priority and preference to under-go PNS and TOP. Decisions were influenced by limited knowledge, lack of lived experience of SCD, family pressure, cultural and religious beliefs, and social stigma. A comprehensive behaviour change communication strategies that empower couples and key stakeholders through culturally sensitive SCD & PNS literacy, and genetic counselling is essential to promote informed decision-making within the cultural context of tribal communities."

Prospective and observational study of pediatric SCD patients (HbSS genotype) enrolled in a chronic RBCX program at a Portuguese Hospital from October 2022 to August 2024. Blood samples were collected before and after RBCX to assess hematological and inflammatory markers. Data were analyzed using <i>SPSSv25</i> <i><sup>®</sup></i> (Significance level <i>p</i> < 0.05); Informed consents were obtained. Thirty-one children (median age 10 years) were studied: 14 were treatment-naïve, and 17 were previously in a chronic RBCX program. The primary indication for starting the program was cerebrovascular disease prevention (81%). Analysis of 286 RBCXs showed no major adverse events or disease-related hospitalizations. Hemoglobin levels increased by 1.5g/dL post-RBCX; HbS, leukocytes, IL-1, and CRP decreased by 69%, 20%, 21%, and 13%, respectively. Other markers showed no significant changes. IL-1, ferritin, and procalcitonin showed high levels before RBCX; IL-6 showed high levels post-RBCX. Considering only naïve patients, they had higher pre-RBCX IL-1 levels than those with prior RBCX (difference of 22.6 pg/mL); IL-6 increased by 17.3% and IL-1 decreased by 23.9% post-RBCX (p < 0.001). RBCX safely reduces HbS, leukocytes, and IL-1 levels, suggesting a modulatory effect on inflammation in SCD patients. Further research is needed to explore cytokine mechanisms in SCD."

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited hematologic disease caused by sickle hemoglobin as the predominant RBC hemoglobin or by sickle hemoglobin in combination with other abnormal β-hemoglobin variants like HbC, HbD and others. Sickling of erythrocytes under deoxygenated conditions is the basis of inflammatory and thrombotic cascades which result in multiple serious complications, leading to early morbidity and mortality. While HLA-matched allogeneic bone marrow transplantation is potentially curative, it has considerable limitations due to potential severe toxicities. Despite slow progress towards novel therapeutic strategies for SCD and hydroxyurea being the sole medication that is shown to reduce vaso-occlusive events and mortality for almost 20 years, several pharmacological agents targeting different mechanisms have been examined in clinical trials and recently US- US-FDA-approved, including L-glutamine and crizanlizumab. Voxelotor was previously US-FDA-approved but has been voluntarily withdrawn from the market as the overall benefit did not outweigh the risks. Gene therapies based on CRISPR-Cas9 and lentiviral vectors have been very recently approved. However, excessive costs are a barrier to widespread use. Nonetheless, there is still a large area of unmet needs for patients with SCD, and further research towards better care is warranted."

Enhancing PK activity lowers 2,3-diphosphyglycerate (2,3-DPG), increases adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and may prevent red blood cell (RBC) sickling. Townes and Berkeley SCD mouse models are commonly used for the development of novel drugs for SCD, but differ from humans in 2,3-DPG and ATP levels, which could be related to underlying differences in PK properties. This study revealed important distinctions with humans (SCD vs healthy controls), such as similar PK/hexokinase (HK) ratios between sickling and non-sickling mouse models and significantly lower PK thermostability in mice. We additionally investigated the effect of a novel RBC PK activator, compound A, on PK properties and sickling tendency in these mice in order to assess SCD mouse model suitability. Results showed that a single dose of compound A led to an increased affinity of PK for phosphoenolpyruvate, a significant increase in PK/HK ratio and a decrease of 2,3-DPG levels. Together, these results offer detailed characterization in the PK properties of two commonly used SCD mouse models, and provide insight into the mode of action of PK activator therapy in SCD mice models."

The therapeutic delivery of oxygen utilizing artificial oxygen carriers as red blood cell substitutes presents a promising avenue for treating a spectrum of disease models. Apart from that, the recent advancement of artificial oxygen carriers intended to supplant conventional blood transfusions draws significant attention due to the exigencies of warfare and the ongoing challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there is a pressing need to formulate stable, non-toxic, and immunologically inert oxygen carriers. Even though numerous challenges are encountered in the development of artificial oxygen carriers, their applicability extends to various medical treatments, encompassing elective and cardiovascular surgeries, hemorrhagic shock, decompression illness, acute stroke, myocardial infarction, sickle cell crisis, and proficient addressing conditions such as cerebral hypoxia. Therefore, this paper provides an overview of therapeutic oxygen delivery using assorted types of artificial oxygen carriers, including hemoglobin-based, perfluorocarbon-based, stem cell-derived, and oxygen micro/nanobubbles, in the treatment of diverse disease models. Additionally, it discusses the potential side effects and limitations associated with these interventions, while incorporating completed and ongoing research and recent clinical developments. Finally, the prospective solutions and general demands of the perfect artificial oxygen carriers were anticipated to be a reference for subsequent research endeavors."

However, evidence is mainly derived from studies conducted with adult populations with musculoskeletal pain, primarily focused on pharmacological treatments and a few alternative intervention modalities (e.g., acupuncture). We examined the role of pretreatment TE in youth participating in two randomized controlled trials of digital cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for chronic pain-the WebMAP2 Trial of youth with chronic primary pain (n = 273) and the iCC-SCD Trial of youth with sickle cell pain (n = 111). Specifically, we tested: 1) whether controlling for TE enhanced the detection of treatment efficacy, 2) the main effect of TE in predicting pain-related outcomes over time (regardless of treatment assignment), and 3) the effect of TE in moderating treatment efficacy (digital CBT vs education control). Findings indicated that adjusting for pretreatment TE did not enhance the ability to detect treatment efficacy. In the WebMAP2 Trial, higher pretreatment TE were associated with greater reductions in anxiety and lower CBT efficacy (relative to education control) in improving depressive and anxiety symptoms. In the iCC-SCD Trial, higher pretreatment TE were associated with greater improvement in mobility and enhanced CBT efficacy (relative to education control) for improving mobility. Overall, higher pretreatment TE were associated with better functioning over time, though the specific domains of improvement and the moderating effects on treatment efficacy somewhat differed between youth with primary and sickle cell-related chronic pain. PERSPECTIVE: Incorporating TE into clinical assessments and ensuring consistent collection, reporting, and analysis in clinical trials are crucial for identifying potential heterogeneous treatment responses. Standardizing TE measures for youth with chronic pain and considering population characteristics are important for understanding TE's role in treatment responses."

    "abstract": "Gamna-Gandy (GG) bodies are sclerosiderotic nodules composed of iron pigment and calcium, that have been described predominantly in the spleens of patients with sickle cell disease. Their formal depiction in the kidney is mainly limited to case reports and small series. We aimed to investigate the incidence of GG bodies and associated clinicopathologic features in consecutive nephrectomies performed for renal tumors. Slides of consecutive nephrectomies for renal neoplasms at 3 institutions were reviewed by genitourinary pathologists, with detailed clinicopathologic features recorded. The incidence of GG bodies in our nephrectomy cohort was 13% (44/350). The most common tumor exhibiting GG bodies was clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC) (40/44), followed by papillary RCC (2/44), chromophobe RCC (1/44), and epithelioid angiomyolipoma (1/44). Most RCCs were pathologic stage pT3a (46%). GG bodies were intratumoral in 77%, peritumoral in 5%, and both in 18% of patients. They were focal in 43% and multifocal in 57%, with the largest focus ranging from 0.2 to 7 mm (mean 1.7 mm). Background fibrosis and hemosiderin laden macrophages were commonly associated (93% for both). All tumors demonstrated cystic elements. In 2 renal tumor specimens, an extensive fungal workup was performed and was negative; the \"structures\" were not formally recognized as GG bodies in either specimen. GG bodies are not an uncommon finding in renal tumors, particularly in clear cell RCC. Awareness of the morphologic appearance is crucial to avoid mistaking them for fungal structures or other organisms."

    "title": "Innovative Insurance to Improve US Patient Access to Cell and Gene Therapy.",
    "abstract": "Policy Points Cell and gene therapies (CGTs) offer treatment for rare and oftentimes deadly disease, but their prices are high, and payers may seek to limit spending. Total annual costs of covering all existing and expected CGTs for the entire US population 2023-2035 to amount to less than $20 per person and concentrate in commercial and state Medicaid plans. Reinsurance fees add to expected costs. Policies that improve coverage and affordability are needed to assure patient access to CGTs. Cell and gene therapies (CGTs) offer treatment to rare and oftentimes deadly diseases. Because of their high price and uncertain clinical outcomes, US insurers commonly restrain patient access to CGTs, and these barriers may create or perpetuate existing disparities. A reconsideration of existing insurance policies to improve access and reduce disparities is currently underway. One method insurers use to support access and protect them from large, unexpected claims is the purchase of reinsurance. In exchange for an upfront per-member-per-month (PMPM) premium, the reinsurer pays the claim and rebates the insurer at the end of the contract period if there are funds leftover. However, existing reinsurance plans may not cover CGTs or charge exorbitant fees for coverage. We simulate the incremental annual per-person reinsurer costs to cover CGTs existing or expected between 2023 and 2035 for the US population and by payer type based on previously published estimates of expected US spending on CGTs, assumed US population of 330 persons, and current CGT reinsurance fees. We illustrate our methods by estimating the incremental annual per-person costs overall payers and to state Medicaid plans of sickle cell disease-targeted CGTs. We estimate annual incremental spending on CGTs 2023-2035 to amount to $20.4 billion, or $15.69 per person. Total annual estimated spending is expected to concentrate among commercial plans. Sickle cell-targeted CGTs add a maximum of $0.78 PMPM in costs to all payers and will concentrate within state Medicaid programs. Reinsurance fees add to expected costs. Annual per-person costs to provide access to CGTs are expected to concentrate in commercial and state Medicaid plans. Policies that improve CGT coverage and affordability are needed."

    "abstract": "Individuals with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) are a minoritized and marginalized community that have disparate health outcomes as a result of systemic racism and disease-related stigma. The purpose of this study was to determine the psychosocial risk factors for families caring for children with SCD at a pediatric SCD center through use of the Psychosocial Assessment Tool (PAT), a validated caregiver-report screener. The PAT was administered annually during routine clinical visits and scored by the SCD Social Worker to provide tailored resources to families. The PAT stratifies scores into 3 categories of psychosocial concern: Universal, Targeted, Clinical. PATs administered between September 2021-December 2022 were analyzed. Two hundred twenty-five PATs were included for analysis. Most caregivers identified as Black, single Women over 21 years old with a high school degree or more. The average patient age was 8.2 years (0-22 years). Sixty-seven percent of PATs fell into the Universal category. Dyads that scored in the Targeted or Clinical categories were more likely to report financial hardship, caregiver mental health concerns, and family stressors (p < 0.001). Nearly 50% of all families reported some form of financial difficulty, including almost 40% in the Universal category. Universal implementation of a psychosocial risk screener identified financial challenges for many families, as well as caregiver burden and mental health concerns, allowing for timely resource support. However, overall risk for many of these families was categorized as Universal or low risk, indicating that distribution of resources and support cannot be based on PAT category alone."

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a mono-genic disorder causing chronic hemolysis, anemia, and vaso-occlusion, leading to musculoskeletal complications such as osteonecrosis, osteoporosis, and bone fractures affecting 50-70% SCD patients. These complications result from a complex interplay of genetic and physiological factors, including abnormal hemoglobin production, chronic inflammation, and oxidative stress. This review discusses the pathophysiology, pre-clinical symptoms, and clinical manifestations of musculoskeletal complications in SCD, as well as current treatment options, including pharmacological interventions, surgical procedures, and bone marrow transplantation. Early detection of pre-clinical symptoms is crucial to prevent progression. Pharmacological interventions (analgesics, anti-inflammatory agents, bone-modifying agents and hydroxyurea), surgical interventions (core decompression, bone grafting, joint replacement and osteotomy) and supportive measures enhance mobility, strength and well-being. A multidisciplinary approach is essential for optimal care, and early diagnosis and management are crucial to prevent long-term damage and improve outcomes. Future research directions include targeted therapies, biomarker investigation and infrastructure development to improve outcomes for SCD individuals with musculoskeletal complications."

    "abstract": "Red cell exchange is important to treat acutely ill sickle cell patients, but it is time-consuming. An automated red cell exchange technique using cell separators developed by different manufacturers helps in removal of sickled hemoglobin and improving blood viscosity. The use of these cell separators permits automated red cell exchange to be performed safely and smoothly with the isovolemic hemodilution. The retrospective analysis of seven cases for automated red cell exchange was performed in IMS and SUM Hospital from September, 2019 to July 2021. One procedure was performed on COBE Spectra Apheresis System and the rest six using Spectra Optia Apheresis System. These procedures were performed on the patients and the decision to perform these procedures was based on clinical indications for red cell exchange following the ASFA guidelines 2019. After only one procedure, all the patients have their sickle hemoglobin reduced to a safe level. End hematocrit was observed to be 33% in three cases, 31.9% in one case, and 30% in the rest three. A total number of red blood cells (RBCs) transfusion in all the cases were 7, 6, 8, 5, 6, 7, and 7 with an average hematocrit of 55%, 56%, 54%, 56%, 55%, 51.7%, and 52.2%, respectively. All the patients partially phenotypically matched, leukoreduced, gamma-irradiated, fresh packed RBCs were provided. Automated red cell exchange came out to be successful in reducing the symptoms along with the improvement in laboratory parameters.

    "abstract": "Prior studies have evaluated transfusion recipient variables impacting red blood cell (RBC) alloimmunization, but few focused on potentially modifiable blood donor or blood component variables. Data from the Recipient Epidemiology and Donor Evaluation Study (REDS)-III, which links donor, component, and patient data in an integrated database, were accessed. For any given RBC unit with sufficient blood donor and component data, we determined if the transfusion recipient experienced a new RBC alloimmunization event (\"case\") within 16 weeks of the transfusion or not (\"control\"). Recipient diagnoses were included in the case-control matching algorithm. A total of 2676 cases were matched with 10,160 controls. In a multivariate conditional logistic regression analysis, recipients who received an RBC unit from donors with a different ABO group had a higher risk of alloimmunization (OR 1.60, 95% CI: 1.35-1.89, p < .001). Likewise, recipients who received RBCs from older donors had a higher risk of RBC alloimmunization (OR 1.01 per year of age, 95% CI: 1.00-1.01, p < .001). Irradiated RBCs were associated with a decreased risk of RBC alloimmunization in transfusion recipients (OR 0.52, 95% CI: 0.46-0.59, p < .001), though a sub-analysis of RBCs transfused to people with sickle cell disease showed no such association (p = .75). Recipients who received RBCs stored for a longer duration also had a lower risk (OR 0.99 per day of storage, 95% CI: 0.99-0.99, p < .001) of alloimmunization. This case-control study identified donor and component variables associated with recipient RBC alloantibody formation. Future mechanistic studies exploring these associations are warranted."

    "abstract": "Both sickle cell anemia (SCA) and socioeconomic status have been associated with altered brain structure and cognitive disability, yet precise mechanisms underlying these associations are unclear. To determine whether brains of individuals with and without SCA appear older than chronological age and if brain age modeling using brain age gap (BAG) can estimate cognitive outcomes and mediate the association of socioeconomic status and disease with these outcomes. In this cross-sectional study of 230 adults with and without SCA, individuals underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and cognitive assessment. Brain age was estimated using DeepBrainNet, a model trained to estimate chronological age from 14 468 structural MRIs from healthy individuals across the lifespan. BAG was defined as estimated brain age minus chronological age. Linear regression examined clinical factors associated with BAG and the ability of BAG to estimate cognitive performance compared to neuroimaging metrics of brain health and ischemic brain injury, such as normalized whole brain volume, white matter mean diffusivity (MD), and infarct volume. BAG and white matter MD were tested further as mediators of the association of socioeconomic status and SCA with cognitive performance. Data were analyzed from October 15, 2023, to July 1, 2024. SCA disease status and economic deprivation as measured using the area deprivation index (ADI). Executive function, crystallized function, processing speed, and full-scale intelligence quotient (FSIQ) were derived from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Toolbox and Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence, Second Edition. Among 230 included adults, 123 individuals had SCA (median [IQR] age, 26.4 [21.8-34.3] years; 77 female [63%]) and 107 individuals did not (control cohort; median [IQR] age, 30.1 [26.3-34.8] years; 77 female [72%]). Participants with SCA had a larger median (IQR) BAG compared to individuals in the control cohort (14.2 [8.0-19.2] vs 7.3 [3.2-11.1] years; median difference, 6.13 years; 95% CI, 4.29-8.05 years; P < .001). Individuals in the control cohort demonstrated a larger BAG relative to the reference population (mean difference, 7.52 years; 95% CI, 6.32-8.72 years; P < .001). Higher economic deprivation was associated with BAG in the control cohort (β [SE] per 1% ADI increase, 0.079 [0.028]; 95% CI, 0.023 to 0.135; P = .006), while intracranial vasculopathy (β [SE], 6.562 [1.883]; 95% CI, 2.828 to 10.296; P < .001) and hemoglobin S percentage (β [SE] per 1% increase, 0.089 [0.032]; 95% CI, 0.026 to 0.151; P = .006) were associated with BAG in participants with SCA. Across neuroimaging metrics of brain health, BAG demonstrated the largest effect size for cognitive outcomes in the control cohort (eg, executive function: r = -0.430; P = .001), while white matter MD demonstrated the largest effect size for cognitive outcomes (eg, executive function: r = -0.365; P = .001) in the SCA cohort. Across the study population, BAG mediated the association of ADI with cognitive performance (eg, executive function: β [SE] per 1-unit decrease in ADI, -0.031 [0.014]; 95% CI, -0.061 to -0.006), while BAG (eg, FSIQ: β [SE], -3.79 [1.42]; 95% CI, -6.87 to -1.40) and white matter MD (eg, FSIQ: β [SE], -4.55 [1.82]; 95% CI, -8.14 to -0.94) mediated the association of SCA with cognitive performance. Adults with SCA and a healthy control cohort with greater economic deprivation demonstrated older brain age, suggestive of insufficient brain development, premature brain aging, or both. Brain estimates of chronological age may inform mechanisms of the association between chronic disease and socioeconomic status with cognitive outcomes in healthy and SCA populations, yet will require confirmation in larger and longitudinal studies."

SCD is prevalent among tribal communities. The objective of this study was to conduct a screening of the tribal population and report the prevalence of SCD in southern Rajasthan, India. A cross-sectional study was conducted in two blocks of southern Rajasthan to determine the prevalence of Sickle Cell Trait (SCT) and SCD. The study population underwent screening for SCD initially using the solubility test method. Family members of individuals tested positive for the solubility test were also screened. Subsequently, blood samples were collected from individuals who were positive for the solubility test. The confirmation of SCT and SCD was carried out through HPLC. The prevalence of SCT and SCD was 9.87% and 0.32%, respectively. The highest combined prevalence (including SCT and SCD) of 15.52% was observed among the Garasiya tribe, followed by the Bhil tribe with the prevalence of 9.68%. SCD is moderately prevalent, with less than a per cent among the tribal population of Southern Rajasthan. However, the prevalence of SCT is about 10%. The study also highlights the feasibility of implementing a population-based screening program. This program can be readily implemented within tribal habitations as a component of the proposed national SCD program."

    "abstract": "Sickle cell anemia (SCA) is recognized globally, but little is known about affected Hispanic populations. In partnership with the Dominican Republic, a Hispanic Caribbean island with a large SCA population, a transcranial Doppler (TCD) screening program provided hydroxyurea to children with conditional velocities. Building local capacity, 10 Dominican medical graduates were certified in TCD examinations and trained in hydroxyurea management. The Stroke Avoidance for Children in REpública Dominicana (SACRED) trial enrolled 283 children with average age of 8.7 ± 3.4 years and 130 (46%) females. At initial screening, treatment-naïve children with conditional velocities (170-199 cm/s) were younger (6.6 ± 2.7 vs 8.9 ± 3.4 years; P = .0002) and more anemic (hemoglobin, 7.4 ± 0.8 vs 8.0 ± 1.2 g/dL; P = .0046) than children with normal screening velocities (<170 cm/s). Among 57 treatment-naïve children receiving 6 months of fixed-dose hydroxyurea at 20 mg/kg per day, average TCD velocities decreased by 20 cm/s, and 61% became normal. Compared with fixed-dose hydroxyurea, dose escalation to maximum tolerated dose (MTD) led to fewer sickle-related events with incidence rate ratio 0.59, 95% confidence intervals 0.36 to 0.98, P = .0420. At MTD, TCD benefits were sustained over 5 years, with 81% reverting to normal and an average TCD velocity decrease of 27 cm/s. Brain magnetic resonance imaging documented substantial baseline parenchymal disease; during treatment, 10% developed new vasculopathy, plus 1 stroke and 1 death. The SACRED trial documents a high burden of cerebrovascular disease among Hispanic children with SCA and demonstrates the feasibility of partnership to establish TCD screening programs, the utility of hydroxyurea to reduce TCD velocities and reduce stroke risk, and sustained benefits of hydroxyurea dose escalation. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT02769845."

We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study of children (younger than age 18 years) between 2016 and 2021 using 3 ED datasets: the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS; a complex survey of US ED encounters), COMPdata (a dataset of encounters for Illinois), and the Pediatric Health Information Systems (PHIS; an administrative database of US children's hospitals). We categorized principal diagnoses using the DGS and compared their distribution. We included 181 607 978 survey-weighted encounters from NHAMCS, 5 352 016 encounters from COMPdata, and 20 859 019 encounters from PHIS. A higher proportion of encounters in the PHIS sample were admitted or transferred (12.7%) compared with those in the NHAMCS (6.1%) or COMPdata (4.2%) samples. Trauma was the most common major group identified among all datasets (22.0% in NHAMCS, 22.2% in COMPdata, and 17.0% in PHIS). Some conditions, such as sickle cell anemia, diabetes mellitus, appendicitis, seizures, and asthma, presented more frequently among children presenting to the PHIS hospitals. We identified comparable diagnostic distributions across different datasets, with differences that are likely attributable to specific characteristics of the data source.

A retrospective review of patients aged 10-19 presenting to a single quaternary-care academic center from 2016 to 2023 with isolated capitellar and trochlear shear fractures was performed. Demographic data, injury mechanism, fracture classification, and surgical approach were recorded. Outcomes included elbow range of motion at the final follow-up, visual analogue scale pain scores, pediatric Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) scales, radiographic and clinical union, return to sport, and postoperative complications. Eight patients were included, four of whom were treated through a single-incision anterolateral approach. Average age was 13 years. Average time of the final clinical follow-up was 21 months, with a radiographic follow-up of 11 months. Five fractures were classified as Dubberly type 2A, two as type 3A, and one as type 3B. At the final follow-up, average elbow range of motion and visual analogue scale pain scores were 3-137 degrees and 0.28 (range: 0-2), respectively.

Postoperative imaging revealed decreased vascularity, and the patient was treated with RBC exchange. Pathology confirmed thrombotic microangiopathy without acute rejection. The patient's condition improved with supportive care, and he was discharged by postoperative day 10. This case highlights the complexity of managing SCD patients undergoing organ transplantation, with a focus on intraoperative challenges and postoperative care."

    "title": "Genetic Assessment of Living Kidney Transplant Donors: A Survey of Canadian Practices.",
    "abstract": "Kidney failure is a prevalent condition with tendency for familial clustering in up to 27% of the affected individuals. Living kidney donor (LKD) transplantation is the optimal treatment option; however, in Canada, more than 45% of LKDs are biologically related to their recipients which subjects recipients to worse graft survival and donors to higher future risk of kidney failure. Although not fully understood, this observation could be partially explained by genetic predisposition to kidney diseases. Genetic testing of potential LKDs may improve risk assessment and inform the safety of donation. The strategies to evaluate these donors are still evolving. In Canada, little is known about the practice of assessing for genetic conditions among LKDs. The aim was to examine the Canadian practices regarding LKDs genetic assessment. Questionnaires were sent to 23 Canadian adult transplant centers to examine their protocols for LKDs genetic assessment. The questionnaire comprised of 10 sections and 21 questions including case scenarios of different LKD encounters. Major domains of the survey addressed general demographics, information sharing practices, effect of mode of inheritance on candidacy decision, having a policy for LKD genetic evaluation, and case scenarios covering the following conditions: autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), Alport syndrome, Fabry disease, familial focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease (ADTKD), sickle cell, and apolipoprotein L1 mutation (APOL1). The questionnaire was sent to the living-donor assessment committee representative (nephrologist) in adult and pediatric kidney transplant centers across Canada. In total, 16 of 23 Canadian centers responded to the survey. Of the 8 surveyed genetic conditions, ADPKD, Alport syndrome, and aHUS were the most frequently encountered. More centers have specific policies for donor evaluation for ADPKD (25%) and aHUS (21.4%) vs none to very few for other genetic conditions. The most cited guidelines are Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO), Canadian Society of Nephrology/Canadian Society of Transplantation (CSN/CST), and the Canadian Blood Services' Kidney Paired Donation Protocol. Canadian transplant centers follow a case-by-case approach rather than a standard protocol for genetic assessment of LKDs given that current guideline recommendations are based on expert opinion due to a lack of a reliable body of evidence. With the expected rise in utilization of the increasingly available genetic testing, early multidisciplinary assessment including medical geneticists has the potential to improve personalized management. Studies examining long-term donor and graft outcomes are needed to construct the basis for evidence-based recommendations and inform the safety of donations."

    "title": "Impact of Severity of Sickle Cell Anemia on Auditory Discrimination Ability and Speech Perception in Noise.",
    "abstract": "<b>Introduction</b> Sickle cell anemia (SCA) is a genetic disorder with clinical manifestations due to circulatory changes, leading to adverse effects on the auditory system that might impact auditory processing, such as auditory discrimination and speech perception ability. This condition is associated with the severity level of anemia. <b>Objective</b> The purpose of the present study was to investigate the influence of anemia severity on auditory discrimination ability and speech perception in noise among SCA patients with normal hearing sensitivity. <b>Methods</b> A total of 52 normal-hearing adults diagnosed with SCA in the age range of 15 to 40 were grouped into mild, moderate, and severe, based on anemia severity. Auditory discrimination tests for frequency, intensity, and duration were evaluated at 500 and 4,000 Hz along with speech perception in noise (SPIN) at 0 dB SNR using the mlp toolbox in the MATLAB software, version 2014a (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA). The IBM Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 26.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) was used for statistical analysis. <b>Results</b> The results revealed an increase in median and interquartile range among anemia groups with increasing severity. Additionally, the median scores were found to be poorer for the higher frequency in all auditory discrimination tests than for the lower one. A regression in performance with an increase in severity for the SPIN test was observed. <b>Conclusion</b> The severity of anemia plays an important role in functional auditory processing deterioration. Circulatory changes secondary to SCA affected auditory discrimination processing and speech perception in noise. However, all auditory discrimination abilities are not necessarily affected equally."

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) confers neurological risks that contribute to cognitive and academic difficulties. Clinical guidelines state that cognition should be monitored using signaling questions. However, evidence is lacking regarding the extent to which signaling questions accurately identify children with cognitive issues. Caregivers of youth with SCD between ages 7 and 16 years (n = 89) responded to a signaling question about their child's academic performance: \"How would you rate your child's academic performance relative to their peers?\" Response choices included below grade level, on grade level, or above grade level. Youth with SCD completed the Wechsler Intelligence Scale of Intelligence, Fifth Edition to assess cognitive functioning. Most children were described by caregivers as being on grade level (67%), followed by below grade level (21%), and above grade level (11%). Cognitive testing revealed that 36% of participants had a low IQ (≤85; i.e., ≥1 SD below the mean), 60% had an IQ within normal limits (86-114; i.e., <1 SD below or above the mean), and 4% had a high IQ (≥115; i.e., ≥1 SD above the mean). Academic performance grouping was significantly associated with differences across cognitive domains (all p < 0.001). Cognitive functioning varied by academic grouping for younger (ages 7-11; all p ≤ 0.002) but not older children (ages 12-16; all p ≥ 0.05). The signaling question's sensitivity for identifying those with cognitive difficulties was low (42%-54%); specificity, negative predictive value, and positive predictive value estimates were acceptable (87%-93%, 74%-84%, and 53%-79%, respectively). Asking caregivers of children with SCD to report on academic performance is a simple method of monitoring cognition. Children rated as below grade level should be referred for cognitive screening or evaluation. However, this question will likely result in a high rate of false negatives, and additional questions may be necessary to determine when to refer patients without obvious academic concerns."

These inherited genetic diseases are characterized by a global distribution and the need for intensive health care. The aim of this report is to present an update on the composition of a cellular Thal-Biobank, to describe its utilization since 2016, to present data on its application in studies on fetal hemoglobin induction and on gene editing, and to discuss its employment as a \"unique tool\" during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. <b>Methods</b>: The methods were as follows: freezing, cryopreservation, long-term storage, and thawing of erythroid precursor cells from β-thalassemia patients; fetal hemoglobin (HbF) induction; CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing; HPLC analysis of the hemoglobin pattern. <b>Results</b>: The updated version of the Thal-Biobank is a cellular repository constituted of 990 cryovials from 221 β-thalassemia patients; the phenotype (pattern of hemoglobin production) is maintained after long-term storage; fetal hemoglobin induction and CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing can be performed using biobanked cells. In representative experiments using an isoxazole derivative as HbF inducer, the HbF increased from 13.36% to more than 60%. Furthermore, in CRIPR/Cas9 gene editing, de novo production of HbA was obtained (42.7% with respect to the trace amounts found in untreated cells). <b>Conclusions</b>: The implemented Thal-Biobank was developed before the COVID-19 outbreak and should be considered a tool of great interest for researchers working on β-thalassemia, with the aim of developing innovative therapeutic protocols and verifying the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on erythroid precursor cells."

    "abstract": "Acute cardiovascular disorders are incriminated in up to 33% of maternal deaths, and the presence of sickle cell anemia (SCA) aggravates the risk of peripartum complications. Herein, we present a 24-year-old Caribbean woman with known SCA who developed a vaso-occlusive crisis at 36 weeks of gestation that required emergency Cesarean section. In the early postpartum period, she experienced fever with rapid onset of acute respiratory distress in the context of COVID-19 infection that required tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilatory support with broad-spectrum antibiotics and blood exchange transfusion. Shortly thereafter, transthoracic echocardiography documented severe biventricular dysfunction associated with raising levels of cardiac troponin and ECG signs of myocardial ischemia. Medical treatment with incremental dobutamine and noradrenaline infusion failed to improve cardiac output and blood gas exchange. After consultation with the regional cardiac center, a prompt decision was made to provide cardiac and respiratory support via implantation of femoral cannula and initiation of veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO, Cardiohelp<sup>®</sup>). Under stable ECMO, the patient was transferred by helicopter to a specialized cardiac center. There were no signs of ongoing hemolysis, and progressive recovery of the right and left ventricular function facilitated forward blood flow through the aortic valve. Three days after implantation, ECMO was weaned, and the cannula were removed. One day later, the patient's chest X-rays showed partial resolution of lung edema. The patient was successfully extubated, and non-invasive ventilation with pulmonary rehabilitation was initiated to speed up her functional recovery."

    "abstract": "The increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in lower and middle - income countries call for preventive public health interventions. Studies from Africa including those from Ghana, consistently reveal high T2DM-related mortality rates. While previous research in the Ho municipality has primarily examined risk factors, comorbidity, and quality of life of T2DM patients, this study specifically investigated mortality predictors among these patients. The study was retrospective involving medical records of T2DM patients. Data extracted included mortality outcome (dead or alive), sociodemographic characteristics (age, sex, marital status, educational level, occupation and location), family history of diseases (diabetes, cardiovascular disease (CVD), or asthma), lifestyle (smoking and alcohol intake), comorbidities (such as skin infections, sickle cell disease, urinary tract infections, and pneumonia) and complications of diabetes (CVD, nephropathy, neuropathy, foot ulcers, and diabetic ketoacidosis) were analyzed using Stata version 16.0 and Python 3.6.1 programming language. Both descriptive and inferential statistics were done to describe and build predictive models respectively. The performance of machine learning (ML) techniques such as support vector machine (SVM), decision tree, k nearest neighbor (kNN), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and logistic regression were evaluated using the best-fitting predictive model for T2DM mortality. Of the 328 participants, 183 (55.79%) were female, and the percentage of mortality was 11.28%. A 100% mortality was recorded among the T2DM patients with sepsis (p-value = 0.012). T2DM in-patients were 3.83 times as likely to die [AOR = 3.83; 95% CI: (1.53-9.61)] if they had nephropathy compared to T2DM in-patients without nephropathy (p-value = 0.004). The full model which included sociodemographic characteristics, family history, lifestyle variables and complications of T2DM had the best prediction of T2DM mortality outcome (ROC = 72.97%). The accuracy for (test and train datasets) were as follows: (90% and 90%), (100% and 100%), (90% and 90%), (90% and 88%) and (88% and 90%) respectively for the various ML classification techniques: logistic regression, Decision tree classifier, kNN classifier, SVM and XGBoost. This study found that all in-patients with sepsis died. Nephropathy was the identified significant predictor of T2DM mortality. Decision tree classifier provided the best classifying potential."

This study aimed to review the clinical trials conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the CRISPR/Cas9 system in treating thalassemia and sickle cell disease (SCD). We searched relevant literature using \"CRISPR Cas\", \"thalassemia\", \"sickle cell\" and \"clinical trial\" as subject terms in PubMed, Cochrane, Web of Science, and Google Scholar up to December 3rd, 2023. Following the PIO format (Patients, Intervention, Outcome), PRISMA guidelines were followed in the study selection, data extraction, and quality assessment processes. Out of 110 publications, 6 studies met our eligibility criteria with a total of 115 patients involved. CRISPR/Cas9 system was used to disrupt BCL11A gene enhancer in 4 studies and to disrupt γ-globin gene promoters in 2 studies. Patients demonstrated significant activation of fetal hemoglobin, elevated total hemoglobin, transfusion independence in thalassemia, and repression of vaso-occlusive episodes in SCD. Using CRISPR/Cas9 system to directly disrupt genes provides a safe and potential one-time functional cure for thalassemia and SCD, suggesting CRISPR/Cas9 as a potential therapeutic tool for the treatment of inherited hematological disorders."

    "title": "Hematologic Complications of Pregnancy.",
    "abstract": "Hematologic complications are common in pregnancy and can significantly impact both maternal and fetal health. Recognizing and treating these complications can be challenging due to the limited evidence available to guide clinical consultants. Iron deficiency anemia is the most prevalent hematologic issue in pregnancy and often occurs due to increased maternal blood volume and the nutritional demands of the growing fetus. Thrombocytopenia is the second most commonly occurring hematologic issue in pregnancy and can be associated with increased blood loss and complications during childbirth. However, the most common type of thrombocytopenia in pregnancy is gestational thrombocytopenia, which does not typically require clinical management. Thus, it is important to distinguish gestational thrombocytopenia from other etiologies of thrombocytopenia in pregnancy that require immediate treatment, including immune thrombocytopenia, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, preeclampsia, and HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzyme levels, and low platelet levels) syndrome. Other important hematologic conditions in pregnancy include non-inherited anemias, such as autoimmune hemolytic anemia and aplastic anemia, as well as inherited anemias, such as sickle cell disease and thalassemia, which may require specialized management to optimize maternal and fetal outcomes. Additionally, bleeding disorders, such as von Willebrand disease and hemophilia, pose unique challenges in pregnancy, especially around the time of delivery, due to the risk of excessive bleeding. Lastly, thromboembolic disorders, such as venous thromboembolism (VTE), remain the leading cause of mortality in pregnancy in developed countries. Pregnancy-related hormonal changes, venous stasis, and hypercoagulability contribute to an increased thromboembolic risk, further exacerbated by additional risk factors such as obesity or a prior personal or family history of VTE. This review aims to summarize current guidelines and management of the most common hematologic disorders in pregnancy."

    "abstract": "The demand for sensitive, rapid, and affordable diagnostic techniques has surged, particularly following the COVID-19 pandemic, driving the development of CRISPR-based diagnostic tools that utilize Cas effector proteins (such as Cas9, Cas12, and Cas13) as viable alternatives to traditional nucleic acid-based detection methods. These CRISPR systems, often integrated with biosensing and amplification technologies, provide precise, rapid, and portable diagnostics, making on-site testing without the need for extensive infrastructure feasible, especially in underserved or rural areas. In contrast, traditional diagnostic methods, while still essential, are often limited by the need for costly equipment and skilled operators, restricting their accessibility. As a result, developing accessible, user-friendly solutions for at-home, field, and laboratory diagnostics has become a key focus in CRISPR diagnostic innovations. This review examines the current state of CRISPR-based diagnostics and their potential applications across a wide range of diseases, including cancers (e.g., colorectal and breast cancer), genetic disorders (e.g., sickle cell disease), and infectious diseases (e.g., tuberculosis, malaria, Zika virus, and human papillomavirus). Additionally, the integration of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance the accuracy, scalability, and efficiency of CRISPR diagnostics is discussed, alongside the challenges of incorporating CRISPR technologies into point-of-care settings. The review also explores the potential for these cutting-edge tools to revolutionize disease diagnosis and personalized treatment in the future, while identifying the challenges and future directions necessary to address existing gaps in CRISPR-based diagnostic research."

The AccuVein® device, uses near-infrared light technology to visualise veins for easier venepuncture. A randomised, controlled trial of the efficacy of the AccuVeinAV400® device in the replacement of peripheral venous lines during a vaso-occlusive crisis was conducted at two centres in France. Adult patients with sickle cell disease were randomised to the AccuVein® or routine IV cannulation procedures. The primary outcome was the number of cannulation attempts needed for effective replacement of the peripheral IV line. Between April 10th, 2018, and March 22nd, 2022, 127 patients were randomised and 126 were analysed (median age: 27.5 years [interquartile range-IQR: 21.3-33.8]; homozygous genotype: 106 (84.1 %)). Although patients in the AccuVein® group reported lower levels of procedure-related pain, use of the device was not associated with a lower median number of venepuncture attempts (2 [1-3], vs. 2 [1-4] in the routine procedure group: p = 0.49). There were no statistically significant intergroup differences in the time to IV line replacement (9.6 [4.1-20.8] in the AccuVein® group vs. 11.7 [4.2-24.7] minutes in the routine procedure group), changes in patient and nurse anxiety and satisfaction levels, or the complication rate. Use of the AccuVeinAV400® device was not associated with a significant decrease of the number of venepuncture attempts or of the time needed for IV line replacement during the management of vaso-occlusive crises.

RA treatment in these patients is believed to be more challenging due to the fear of increasing the risk of infection and complications of SCD. We are reporting 7 patients with concurrent SCD and RA. The average age at the time of the diagnosis of RA was 33.3±12.6 years (ranging from 16 to 53 years), and most were women (5/7). Most of the patients were positive for rheumatoid factor (6/7) or anticyclic citrullinated peptide (6/7). Four patients were treated with hydroxyurea. The most used antirheumatic drugs were methotrexate (7/7), biologic agents (5/7), and prednisone (4/7). Two patients were in remission, four had low and one had high disease activity. Four patients (4/7) had avascular necrosis, two in the shoulders and two in the hip joints. Four patients had emergency visits or hospitalizations within one year of the diagnosis of RA, but none had blood transfusions, infections, or death. The start of antirheumatic medications was not associated with an increased risk of infection, blood transfusions, emergency visits, or hospitalizations, nor with a worsening of laboratory measures. The findings suggest that the treatment of RA in patients with SCD should follow the same strategy as in patients without SCD. However, treatment should be individualized according to the individual patient's risk of infection and SCD complications."

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited hemoglobinopathy characterized by the production of sickle hemoglobin, leading to red blood cells sickling and hemolysis in hypoxic conditions. The resulting acute and chronic endothelial inflammation leads to chronic organ damage. Respiratory manifestations in SCD usually start from childhood and represent the leading causes of morbidity and mortality. Nevertheless, they are generally poorly addressed or recognized later in life, often contributing to a more severe course and complications. This narrative review aims to outline the significant acute and chronic respiratory manifestations in children with SCD, focusing on prevention and clinical management. Compelling issues that need to be addressed in the future are also discussed. We searched the PubMed database for original papers written in English. Age restrictions were set for children (birth to 18 years). No limitations were set for the date and study country. Early detection and treatment of respiratory manifestations in SCD should be central to follow-up with patients affected by SCD. Nonetheless, studies are lacking, especially in pediatric age, and there is still no consensus on their management. Further research is strongly needed to accomplish universally accepted guidelines to guarantee patients the best care possible."

    "title": "The modern use of hydroxyurea for children with sickle cell anemia.",
    "abstract": "Over the past 40 years, the introduction and refinement of hydroxyurea therapy has led to remarkable progress in the care of individuals with sickle cell anemia (SCA). From initial small proof-of-principle studies to multicenter phase III controlled clinical trials and then numerous open-label studies, the consistent benefits of once-daily oral hydroxyurea have been demonstrated across the lifespan. Elevated fetal hemoglobin (HbF) serves as the most important treatment response, as HbF delays sickle hemoglobin polymerization and reduces erythrocyte sickling. Increased amounts of HbF, especially when distributed across the majority of erythrocytes, improve clinical outcomes by reducing hemolytic anemia and preventing vaso-occlusion, thereby ameliorating both acute and chronic - and overt and covert - complications. Additional benefits of hydroxyurea beyond HbF induction include lower neutrophil and platelet counts, reduced inflammation, and improved rheology. Toxicities of hydroxyurea in SCA are typically mild and predictable; modest cytopenia is expected and actually therapeutic, while occasional gastrointestinal and cutaneous manifestations are well-tolerated. Long-term risks of hydroxyurea for SCA are mainly theoretical but require ongoing surveillance. Accordingly, hydroxyurea should be initiated as part of standard of care, ideally in the first year of life. Proper dosing of hydroxyurea is critical, aiming through stepwise dose escalation to achieve modest but safe myelosuppression, with periodic adjustments for weight gain. Precision dosing using pharmacokinetics may facilitate optimal dosing without frequent dose adjustments. Although transformative and even curative therapies for SCA are emerging, hydroxyurea is the only available and accessible disease-modifying treatment that can address the global burden of disease, especially in low-resource settings within sub-Saharan Africa."

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an autosomal recessive genetic blood disorder. It affects up to 2.6% of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia population. The paediatric haematology/oncology (PHO) team noticed that 75% of paediatric patients were inappropriately referred to the PHO department. Also, 86% of patients were investigated with unnecessary investigations followed by outpatient haematological clinic visits which cause financial burden to the hospital, job load for medical staff and psychological burden for families. We carried out an initial audit of PHO referrals and requested laboratory tests over a 3-month period (October-December 2022). The PHO team developed a Clinical Pathway Guidelines (CPG), algorithm for early SCD detection and consultation form for suspected patients with SCD. Staff education about the new CPG was done. In addition, a dedicated PHO physician was assigned to map all referrals and provide rapid responses or outpatient department appointment dates for daily consultations and referrals. Furthermore, posters illustrating the algorithm for early SCD detection were printed and distributed to various units. The percentage of inappropriately referred patients improved during the three-quarters to reach above the desired target of 10%. This per cent reached 0% by the end of Q3 September 2023, indicating a sustainable improvement. Also, the per cent of unnecessary laboratory tests decreased from 86% before starting the project to 0% by the end of Q3. Finally, the number of wrong outpatient haematology visits decreased from 2 to 4 visits/week to 0 visits. Staff education and adherence to guidelines are major priorities for the implementation of SCD referral guidelines in the paediatric department. This improves the utilisation of hospital resources, decreases the staff workload, hospital costs for unnecessary investigations and enhances the psychological care for families of patients with SCD."

Lung function abnormalities commonly reported among children with SCD living in Africa are restrictive impairments. However, in high-income countries, reports suggest that obstructive lung function impairment is more predominant. The exact process that contributes to lung disease in SCD must be continuously explored and large-scale longitudinal studies employing multiple lung function methods are needed urgently.

Furthermore, we assessed CEC subtypes, including circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs, CD31+/CD45-/CD146+/CD133+) and mature CECs (mCECs, CD31+/CD45-/CD146+/CD133-) with mCECs further subdivided into resting CECs (rCECs, VCAM-1-) and activated CECs (aCECs, VCAM-1+). As compared to healthy controls, total CECs and mCECs were elevated in SCD blood as compared to healthy control blood. Using the same markers along with size-based gating, we also used flow cytometry to enumerate endothelial-derived extracellular vesicles (EEVs) in plasma. We assessed EEV subtypes based on VCAM-1 expression, including activated EEVs (aEEVs, CD31+/CD45-/CD146+/CD133-/VCAM-1+) and resting EEVs (rEEVs, VCAM-1 negative), presumably derived from activated and resting endothelial cells, respectively. aEEVs were elevated in SCD patient plasma as compared to healthy controls. Importantly, in SCD patients, total EEVs and aEEVs were increased during self-reported pain crisis as compared to steady state. Plasma markers of endothelial cell activation including soluble E-selectin, P-selectin, VCAM-1, and ICAM-1 were elevated in SCD plasma. These data highlight strategies to detect SCD-related endothelial cell activation and demonstrate that endothelial cell activation markers may be useful to evaluate curative and non-curative therapies in SCD patients."

    "title": "Metabolic stimulation improves bioenergetics and haematologic indices of circulating erythrocytes from sickle cell mice.",
    "abstract": "Circulating mature red blood cells (RBCs) from patients and mice with sickle cell disease (SCD) abnormally retain mitochondria, a factor shown to contribute to the disease's pathobiology. To further understand the functional implications of RBC mitochondria retention in SCD, we used mitochondria inhibitors and metabolites/substrates from the tricarboxylic acid cycle, oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis pathways (ADP, glutamate, malate, pyruvate, succinate or all metabolites combined) and examined RBC bioenergetics, reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, calcium flux and hydration. In RBCs from sickle mice, mitochondria inhibition reduced ATP levels by 30%-60%, whereas control RBCs were unaffected. Conversely, in vitro treatment with metabolites/substrates known to stimulate mitochondria function increased RBC ATP levels and reduced RBC ROS, and these effects were notably more pronounced in sickle RBCs compared to those in control mice. In sickle RBCs, the increases in ATP and decreases in ROS were associated with greater decreases in RBC baseline calcium concentration and improvements in calcium flux. These changes also led to greater increases in RBC volume and hydration, and greater decreases in mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration in sickle RBCs compared to control RBCs. These results propose a novel model of RBC metabolism in SCD, where retained mitochondria in circulating RBCs are functional and can significantly impact RBC bioenergetics, ATP production and RBC hydration and redox status. These in vitro findings could inform the development of in vivo strategies aimed at increasing RBC ATP, reducing RBC ROS, improving RBC hydration, which could decrease sickling and prove beneficial in SCD. KEY POINTS: Red blood cells (RBCs) from humans and mice with sickle cell disease (SCD) abnormally retain mitochondria. Mitochondria inhibitors lower ATP in circulating RBCs from sickle mice indicating that retained mitochondria contribute to ATP levels in sickle RBC. Metabolic stimulation of mitochondria function improves RBC bioenergetics, redox state and calcium flux, and increases RBC hydration. These data propose a new model of RBC metabolism in SCD, where in addition to glycolysis, retained mitochondria contribute to RBC ATP production. The effects of metabolic stimulation of RBCs resulting in improved RBC bioenergetics and hydration may prove beneficial in SCD."

    "abstract": "Despite the proven efficacy of evidence-based healthcare interventions in reducing adverse outcomes and mortality associated with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD), a vast majority of affected individuals in Africa remain deprived of such care. Hydroxyurea (HU) utilization among SCD patients in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) stands at less than 1%, while in Nigeria, approximately 13% of patients benefit from HU therapy. To enhance HU utilization, targeted implementation strategies addressing provider-level barriers are imperative. Existing evidence underscores the significance of addressing barriers such as inadequate healthcare worker training to improve HU adoption. The ACCELERATE study aims to evaluate the adoption of HU among providers through the Screen, Initiate, and Maintain (SIM) intervention, facilitated by healthcare worker training, clinical reminders, and task-sharing strategies, thereby enhancing patient-level SCD management in Nigeria. This study will implement the SIM intervention, encompassing patient screening, initiation of HU treatment, and maintenance of dosage, which will be implemented via the TAsk-Strengthening Strategy for Hemoglobinopathies (TASSH TCP), derived from our team's TAsk-Strengthening Strategy for Hypertension control (TASSH) trials. Employing a sequential exploratory mixed-methods approach within the Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, and Sustainment (EPIS) framework, this study will assess SIM adoption by providers in Nigeria. The primary outcome is the rate of SIM adoption at clinical sites at 12 months, with secondary outcomes including sustainability/maintenance of SIM intervention and implementation fidelity. This study's findings will offer crucial insights into effective SCD management strategies, leveraging existing SCD clinical networks and resources in Nigeria to enhance HU adoption among providers in a scalable and sustainable manner. Additionally, the study will inform best practices for implementing HU therapy in resource-constrained settings, benefiting healthcare providers, policymakers, and stakeholders invested in improving SCD care delivery.

    "abstract": "Depression commonly arises among adolescents who have experienced long-standing psychosocial difficulties, especially those facing chronic illnesses such as sickle cell anemia (SCA). SCA is a global health concern, and Tanzania is one of the countries with a high incidence, estimated at 8,000-11,000 births per year. This study aims to assess the magnitude and factors associated with depression among adolescents with SCA. A cross-sectional analytical study was conducted on adolescents aged 10-19 years attending sickle cell clinics in referral hospitals in Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania, from October 2023 to March 2024. Socio-demographic and SCA severity data were collected using pre-structured and pre-tested questionnaires. A validated Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) tool was used to screen for depression. Univariate and multivariate regression models were used to determine factors associated with clinical depression. A P value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Among the 326 adolescents enrolled and screened, 49 adolescents (15%) had clinical depression, encompassing those in the moderate, moderately severe, and severe depression categories. Overall 216 (53.7%) adolescents exhibited varying degrees of depression, ranging from mild to severe. Specifically, 167 participants (38.7%) had mild depression, 44 (13.5%) had moderate depression, 4 (1.2%) had moderately severe depression, and 1 (0.3%) had severe depression. Painful episodes within the previous 12 months were significantly associated with clinical depression (aOR = 2.49) (95% CI: 1.17-5.29, p = 0.01). Depression is common among adolescents with SCA in our setting. Painful episodes experienced within the previous 12 months were significantly associated with clinical depression. This study highlights the need to screen adolescents with SCA for depression and integrate mental health services in sickle cell clinics."

The human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) incorporates protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) into its tegument, yet the biological relevance and mechanisms of this incorporation remain unclear. Our study offers the first characterization of the PP1 interactome during HCMV infection and its alterations. Using co-immunoprecipitation, mass spectrometry, and quantitative proteomics, we identified 159 high-confidence interacting proteins (HCIPs) in the PP1 interactome, consisting of 126 human and 33 viral proteins. We observed significant temporal changes in the PP1 interactome following HCMV infection, including the altered interactions of PP1 regulatory subunits. Further analysis highlighted the central roles of these PP1 interacting proteins in intracellular trafficking, with particular emphasis on the trafficking protein particle complex and Rab GTPases, which are crucial for the virus's manipulation of host cellular processes in virion assembly and egress. Additionally, our study on the noncatalytic PP1 inhibitor 1E7-03 revealed a decrease in PP1's interaction with key HCMV proteins, supporting its potential as an antiviral agent. Our findings suggest that PP1 docking motifs are critical in viral-host interactions and offer new insights for antiviral strategies."

    "abstract": "Long-term consumption of erythritol, a widely used sugar substitute, has been associated with increased risks of thrombosis and cardiometabolic diseases. In this study, we investigated the effects and mechanisms of allulose in mitigating these risks compared to erythritol using the clusterProfiler tool in R (version 4.12.6). Since a high-fat diet (HFD) is known to enhance platelet aggregation, we compared the pathways related to these processes between groups of mice treated with allulose and those treated with erythritol. While erythritol exacerbated HFD-induced increased platelet aggregation, allulose treatment significantly reduced it. Further analysis of platelet gene expression in sickle cell disease (SCD) patients to explore the potential of using sugar substitutes revealed that platelet coagulation mechanisms could be exacerbated by HFD. Additionally, the top up- and downregulated pathways in SCD were significantly reduced in the allulose-treated group compared to the erythritol group. Specific mechanisms related to this include the mitochondrial complex I and mitochondrial translational process as potential pathological factors in platelet coagulation related to SCD. Therefore, this study demonstrates that allulose may offer a safer alternative to erythritol in dietary applications, especially in individuals susceptible to thrombotic events, by modulating critical pathways associated with platelet function and mitochondrial activity."

    "abstract": "Hematological emergencies are critical medical conditions that require immediate attention due to their rapid progression and life-threatening nature. As various examples, hypercalcemia, often associated with cancers such as multiple myeloma, can lead to severe neurological and cardiac dysfunction. Hyperleukocytosis, common in acute myeloid leukemias, increases the risk of leukostasis and multiorgan failure. Sickle cell crisis, a common complication in sickle cell disease, results from vaso-occlusion, leading to acute pain and tissue ischemia. Tumor lysis syndrome, reported in cases of rapid destruction of cancer cells, causes electrolyte imbalances and acute kidney injury. Acute transfusion reactions, fundamental in hematological conditions, can range from mild allergic responses to severe hemolysis and shock, requiring prompt management. Disseminated intravascular coagulation, involving excessive coagulation and bleeding, is commonly triggered by hematological malignancies, common in the first phases of acute promyelocytic leukemia. Recently, in the era of bispecific antibodies and chimeric antigen receptor T cells, cytokine release syndrome is a manifestation that must be recognized and promptly treated. Understanding the pathophysiology, recognizing the clinical manifestations, and ensuring adequate diagnostic strategies and management approaches for each condition are central to early intervention in improving patient outcomes and reducing mortality."

Asthma is common in children with sickle cell disease and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. This study aimed to describe the impact of asthma on the occurrence of acute chest syndrome in children with sickle cell disease who were followed up in French Guiana. <b>Methods:</b> We performed a multicenter nested case-control study between January 2012 and December 2022. Our study population consisted of children, aged between 6 months and 18 years, who were diagnosed with sickle cell disease at birth and hospitalized at least once for acute chest syndrome during the study period. <b>Results:</b> A total of 588 children were followed up for sickle cell disease. Of these, 390 had sickle cell disease, 180 had SC, and 18 had Sβ + thalassemia. Of the 390-sickle cell disease, we identified 35 who also had asthma, giving an estimated prevalence of asthma of 8.9% among children with sickle cell disease in French Guiana. Only asthma was significantly associated with acute chest syndrome (<i>p</i> < 0.001). <b>Conclusions:</b> The prevalence of asthma in children with sickle cell disease is underestimated. Asthma is an independent risk factor for acute chest syndrome. Given the seriousness of asthma in children with sickle cell disease, systematic screening for asthma in children with sickle cell disease has been implemented. This screening, which will be evaluated after one year, will help to better characterize asthmatic children with sickle cell disease and improve their care."

Our study aims to assess these children's neurocognitive and developmental profiles and identify related factors. We conducted a descriptive cross-sectional study involving 287 children, aged 0 to 68 months, using the Mullen Scales of Early Learning and the Gensini Gavito Scale. We also screened for maternal depression using the Hopkins Symptoms Checklist-10. More than half of the participants were boys, with an average age of 4 years. Remarkably, 95.8% (score T < x¯ +2 SD) of children scored below average on the Mullen Scales. Significant associations were found between early neurocognitive development and factors like maternal depression, socioeconomic status, maternal education, age of weaning, and responses to the Ten-Questions Questionnaire (<i>p</i> < 0.005). Conclusion, children with sickle cell disease show below-average cognitive development, with maternal depression being a critical factor. Longitudinal studies are vital to understanding the long-term cognitive effects of sickle cell disease, particularly in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where targeted support is urgently needed."

Once on shore, sargassum degradation through anaerobic metabolism elicits the release of many noxious molecules, including hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) and ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>). H<sub>2</sub>S has been long recognized as a malodorous and highly toxic gas, while chronic exposure has not been extensively explored. Our objective was to assess whether pregnant women exposed to sargassum emissions would be more prone to developing hypertensive disorders compared to unexposed women. We conducted a retrospective study including 3020 pregnant women at the Obstetrics Department of the University Hospital of Martinique between 25 January 2016 and 31 July 2020. Exposure was defined as a distance of less than 2 km between the residence/workplace of the women and the sargassum strandings. Multivariate regression retained age, body mass index, sickle cell disease, primipaternity, gestational diabetes and sargassum emissions exposure as independent predictors of hypertensive events in pregnant women. Jointly with previous studies from our group, this study highlights the deleterious effects of sargassum emissions on human health in individuals chronically exposed to low to moderate H<sub>2</sub>S concentrations."

This study compared CMR parameters, quantified by cine SSFP sequences, in 48 adult SCD patients without apparent cardiac involvement (defined by the absence of known risk factors, normal electrocardiogram, and no macroscopic myocardial fibrosis or significant cardiac iron on T2* CMR) to matched cohorts of 96 healthy controls and 96 thalassemia major (TM) patients without cardiac damage. Nine paediatric SCD patients were also analysed and compared to age- and gender-matched groups of nine TM patients and nine healthy subjects. In all groups, studied males displayed higher biventricular volumes and mass indexes than females. Male SCD patients showed significantly higher left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic volume index (EDVI), LV end-systolic volume index (ESVI), LV stroke volume index (SVI), cardiac index, LV and right ventricular (RV) mass index, and atrial areas than healthy subjects. Females with SCD exhibited increased LV EDVI, LV SVI, RV mass index, and left atrial area index compared to healthy controls. SCD and TM patients showed comparable biatrial areas and biventricular volumes and function. When compared to TM, SCD males exhibited a larger mass index, while SCD females showed an increased RV mass index. CMR parameters were similar across all paediatric groups. By establishing the biatrial and biventricular reference ranges through CMR for adult male and female SCD patients, we aimed to prevent possible misdiagnosis of cardiomyopathy in this population by taking into account cardiac adaptation due to anaemia."

    "abstract": "The transsulfuration (TSS) pathway is an alternative source of cysteine for glutathione synthesis. Little of the TSS pathway in antioxidant capacity in sickle cell disease (SCD) is known. Here, we evaluate the effects of TSS pathway activation through cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) to attenuate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and ferroptosis stresses in SCD. A vital contribution of the TSS pathway in sustaining cysteine levels is detected only under hemin exposure or physiological but not supraphysiological cystine supplement. Mechanistic studies show that hemin suppresses CBS expression to inhibit the TSS pathway and de novo cysteine biosynthesis. By contrast, the expression of CBS is inducible by dimethyl fumarate (DMF) through nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) activation and CpG islands DNA hydroxymethylation. DMF induces the expression of L-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase (L2HGDH) to downregulate L-2-hydroxyglutarate (L2HG) and increase global and locus-specific DNA hydroxymethylation levels. This DMF-upregulated DNA hydroxymethylation affects CBS locus chromatin structure modifications and upregulates gene expression. Our results suggest that CBS of the TSS pathway plays an important role in maintaining cysteine levels under restricted cystine availability or excess hemin exposure, and CBS upregulation by DMF increases the cellular glutathione levels to protect against ROS and ferroptosis stress in SCD."

The incidence of B19V primary cases was studied through an interrupted time-series analysis. Genomes of 2023 strains were sequenced in the NS1-VP1u region. Blood viral loads, IgG and IgM levels were analyzed in 158 cases according to clinical manifestations with Kruskal-Wallis test and a machine learning approach based on k-nearest neighbors. During the 2023-2024 B19V outbreak, there was an 8-time increase in the incidence of B19V infections compared with pre-pandemic levels (8.25 (95%CI: 5.79-11.76)). The 2023 strains belonged to genotype 1a and were closely related to pre-2019 strains. Blood viral loads were significantly different between clinical presentations (p<0.0001). Machine learning allowed us to classify 68.8% (95% CI: 60.9-75.9) patients into the correct clinical group. The 2023-24 epidemic is probably due to the reemergence of the pre-2019 strain.

SCR stage was based on fundoscopy instead of the Goldberg classification, since fluorescein angiography was not routinely used. Medical/ophthalmological history and hematologic characteristics were retrieved from medical records. 106 eyes of 60 patients were analyzed. The median follow-up period was 34.5 months (range 8-70, IQR 25-55). Macular thinning was present in 41 eyes (38.7%) at baseline and in 52 eyes (49.1%) at follow-up. Progression of macular thinning was observed in 25.5% (27/106) of the eyes and SCR progression in 15.1% (16/106) of the eyes. Predictors for progression of macular thinning were proliferative retinopathy (adjusted OR (aOR) 3.40, p=0.024), lower vessel density in the superior capillary plexus of the inferior parafoveal subfield (aOR 0.88, p=0.003) and higher vessel density in the deep capillary plexus of the inferior parafoveal subfield (aOR 1.17, p=0.001). No association was found between progression of macular thinning and worsening of other organ damage, SCR progression, ocular complications or laser treatment. SCD-related maculopathy progresses in many patients without impairing visual acuity during short-term follow-up. Progression of maculopathy is correlated with proliferative retinopathy and vessel densities in inferior parafoveal subfields. Further research is needed to elucidate functional consequences of macular changes."

On day one post-operatively, central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) was detected in the operated eye. We hypothesize that the expansion of the gas in the postoperative period combined with the presence of a retinal explant might have caused a moderate elevation of the IOP that caused extensive retinal arteriolar shutdown in the backdrop of SCR. CRAO can be a devastating complication following scleral buckling procedure combined with gas insertion in SCR, caution is required when performing scleral explant combined with expansile gas in a patient with sickle cell vasculopathy."

The transcription factor MYB has been extensively proven to be a master regulator of the γ-globin gene, but its role in the regulation of ζ-globin remains incompletely understood. Here, we report a mechanistic study on the derepression of ζ-globin both <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i>. We show that MYB depletion in mouse models and human hematopoietic stem cells leads to consistent and remarkable reactivation of ζ-globin. Furthermore, multiomics analysis and functional validation of <i>MYB</i>-knockout and wild-type cell lines reveal that ETO2 functions as a novel repressor of ζ-globin through coordination with NuRD nucleosome remodeling and the deacetylation complex to modulate histone deacetylation of ζ-globin. Additionally, we evaluate the clinical significance of these findings by knocking out <i>ETO2</i> in primary CD34 <sup>+</sup> cells from nondeletional hemoglobin H patients, which results in a significant increase in ζ-globin expression. The RNA-seq data reveal that key erythroid genes are more co-regulated by <i>Myb</i> and <i>Eto2</i> than by <i>Myb</i> and <i>Klf1</i>, highlighting a distinctly enhanced erythroid-specific transcriptional impact within the MYB-ETO2 regulatory axis. Compared with <i>ETO2</i> knockout alone, codepletion of <i>ETO2</i> and <i>BCL11A</i> did not significantly activate ζ-globin, suggesting that the MYB-ETO2 pathway primarily silences ζ-globin.

    "title": "Ketorolac vs Morphine for Severe Vaso-Occlusive Crisis in Sickle Cell Disease: An Open-Label Randomized Controlled Trial (KISS Study).",
    "abstract": "To compare the efficacy and safety of intravenous (IV) ketorolac and IV morphine in the management of severe vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) in children with sickle cell disease (SCD). An open-label, randomized controlled trial was conducted from January 2021 to July 2022 wherein children with SCD aged 3 to 15 years, presenting with severe VOC (score > 6 on the Wong-Baker Faces Pain scale) were included. Block randomization with minimization was done and participants received either IV ketorolac (intervention) or IV morphine infusion (standard). The pain score was reassessed three hourly and if the pain score exceeded 6, the drug dose was escalated every 3 hours, upto a maximum of three escalating doses. A pain score of ≤ 6 were regarded as response. The mean (SD) pain scores at admission in the ketorolac and morphine groups were 9.28 (0.89) and 9.12 (1.01), respectively (P = 0.636). At 3, 6, 9, and 12 hours of infusion, the mean pain scores in the ketorolac and morphine groups were 8.04 (1.24) vs 8.28 (1.24), P = 0.313; 7.04 (1.210) vs 7.28 (1.28), P = 0.331; 6.40 (1.26) vs 6.28 (1.17), P = 0.860; and 5.56 (1.00) vs 5.60 (1.04), P = 0.817, respectively. Five and eleven children developed minor side effects in the ketorolac and morphine groups, respectively (P = 0.069). Overall, one child in the ketorolac group and two in the morphine persisted to have severe pain even after 12 hours of therapy (P = 0.55). Intravenous ketorolac may be considered as a good alternative to IV morphine in the management of severe VOC in SCD."

    "title": "Determinants of anemia in school-going adolescents: a case study in Douala, Cameroon.",
    "abstract": "Anemia is a medical condition resulting from a reduction in the number of red blood cells below the reference range. It is a major public health problem, particularly among adolescents, as it can have negative effects on cognitive performance, growth and reproduction. This study aims to assess the determinants of anemia among adolescents in schools in the city of Douala. A cross-sectional study was carried out among 511 adolescents aged 10-15 years, selected by random sampling from four secondary schools in Douala. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire, including anthropometric measurements and hemoglobin tests to assess anemia. Anemia was defined according to specific thresholds (e.g. hemoglobin < 12 g/dL for girls and < 13 g/dL for boys). Severity was classified as mild, moderate and severe. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to identify determinants of anemia, controlling for confounding variables, and associations were established by calculating Odds ratios, Odds ratio adjusts, confidence intervals and P-value. Statistical significance was declared at P < 0.05. The mean age of participants was 11.9 ± 1.30 years, with a slight predominance of girls (50.7%) over boys (49.3%). The prevalence of anemia was 40.3% (95% CI: 35.0-45.6%), including 15.7% mild anemia (95% CI: 12.0-19.4%), 23.9% moderate anemia (95% CI: 19.7-28.1%) and 0.7% severe anemia (95% CI: 0.1-2.7%). Independent determinants of anemia included rural residence [AOR = 8.39 (95% CI: 5.26-13.65); p < 0.001], status of parents divorced [OR = 2.60 (95% CI: 1.57- 4.34); p = 0.0001] or deceased [AOR = 7.73 (95% CI: 1.65- 41.90); p = 0.011], onset of first menstrual period [AOR = 6.59 (95% CI: 2.28-72.19); p = 0.001], the absence of iron supplementation [AOR = 1.68 (95% CI: 1.04-2.74; p = 0.034] and the occurrence of an illness in the previous three months (malaria, sickle cell disease, viral hepatitis, amoebiasis, typhoid fever, etc.) [AOR = 3.24 (95% CI: 1.14-22.37); p = 0.012]. This study highlights a worrying prevalence of anemia among adolescents in Douala, with clearly identified determinants. The results underline the importance of factors such as rural residence, parental status and menarche, which can inform public health policies. It is essential to integrate these elements into targeted intervention programs, particularly in nutrition and iron supplementation, especially in rural areas. Finally, longitudinal studies and intervention-based research are needed to better understand the causal mechanisms of adolescent anemia in this context."

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to describe clinical complications and healthcare resource utilization (HCRU) among patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) with recurrent vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs) and patients with transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia (TDT) in Germany. The Betriebskrankenkasse (BKKs) Database was used to identify patients with SCD or TDT. To be eligible for inclusion, patients with SCD were required to have ≥ 2 VOCs/year in any two consecutive years and ≥ 12 months of available data before and after the index date (second VOC in the second consecutive year). Patients with TDT were required to have ≥ 8 red blood cell transfusions (RBCTs) in any 12-month period and ≥ 12 months of available data after the index date (first RBCT). Clinical and HCRU outcomes were analyzed during follow-up. Overall, 84 patients with SCD with recurrent VOCs and 68 patients with TDT were identified in the BKKs database. Among patients with SCD with recurrent VOCs, the most prevalent complications were retinopathy (45.2%), multisystem organ disease/failure (40.5%), and mental health complications (31.0%); among patients with TDT, they were endocrine (69.1%) and cardiopulmonary (55.9%) complications and malignancies (44.1%). Patients with SCD experienced a mean of 4.0 (standard deviation [SD] 3.9) VOCs and 1.9 (SD 2.5) hospitalizations per patient per year (PPPY) during follow-up. Patients with TDT had a mean (SD) of 16.4 (11.2) RBCTs and 59.4 (40.8) outpatient visits PPPY. Patients with SCD with recurrent VOCs or TDT in Germany experience significant clinical complications and HCRU."

    "title": "Circulating biomarkers associated with pediatric sickle cell disease.",
    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic blood disorder caused by a mutation in the HBB gene, which encodes the beta-globin subunit of hemoglobin. This mutation leads to the production of abnormal hemoglobin S (HbS), causing red blood cells to deform into a sickle shape. These deformed cells can block blood flow, leading to complications like chronic hemolysis, anemia, severe pain episodes, and organ damage. SCD genotypes include HbSS, HbSC (HbC is an abnormal variant of hemoglobin), and HbS/β-thalassemia. Sickle cell trait (SCT), HbAS, represents the carrier state, while other hemoglobin variants include HbCC, HbAC, and the normal HbAA. Over 7.5 million people worldwide live with SCD, with a high mortality rate in sub-Saharan Africa, including Ghana. Despite its prevalence, SCD is underdiagnosed and poorly managed, especially in children. Characterized by intravascular hemolysis, SCD leads to oxidative stress, endothelial activation, and systemic inflammation. Identifying circulating blood biomarkers indicative of organ damage and systemic processes is vital for understanding SCD and improving patient management. However, research on biomarkers in pediatric SCD is limited and few have been identified and validated. This study explores specific circulating biomarkers in pediatric SCD in Ghana (West Africa), hypothesizing that inflammatory and neuronal injury markers in children with SCD could predict disease outcomes. Clinical data were collected from 377 children aged 3-8 years with various Hb genotypes, including SCD and SCT, at Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital in Accra, Ghana (2021-2022). A total of 80 age- and sex-matched subjects were identified. A cross-sectional study utilized a multiplexed immunoassay procedure to evaluate serum biomarkers, including cytokines, chemokines, vascular injury markers, systemic inflammation markers, cell-free heme scavengers, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and angiogenic factors. Elevated levels of BDNF, Ang-2, CXCL10, CCL11, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-10, IL12p40, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, Tie-2, and VEGFA were observed in HbSS subjects, correlating with hemoglobin level, leukocyte, and erythrocyte counts. Heme scavengers like HO-1, hemopexin, and haptoglobin also correlated with these parameters. ROC and AUC analyses demonstrated the potential of these biomarkers in predicting SCD outcomes. These findings suggest that there are significant differences between biomarker expression among the different genotypes examined. We conclude that a predictive algorithm based on these biomarkers could be developed and validated through longitudinal assessment of within-genotype differences and correlation of the data with disease severity or outcomes. With such a tool one can enhance SCD management and improve patient outcomes. This approach may pave the way for personalized interventions and better clinical care for pediatric SCD patients."

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most common hemoglobinopathy in North America. The life expectancy of SCD has extended into adulthood with screenings, preventative care, and hydroxyurea. However, comorbidities arise as adults with SCD age, leading to early mortality. We conducted a retrospective chart review of the Georgia Comprehensive Sickle Cell Center at Grady Health System, analyzing records of deceased SCD patients from 2013 to 2020. Amongst the 72 patients analysed, majority had severe complications from SCD and at least 1 cardiovascular comorbidity. The median age of death was 44 (STD = 15.5) for all genotypes with the median age of death at 39 (STD = 14.26) for SS and Sβ0 genotypes (n = 51). There was no difference in the median age of death for patients who maintained regular clinic visits (a visit in the last 6 months prior to death) compared to those who did not. Despite hydroxyurea's known benefits in reducing SCD morbidity and mortality, less than 50% of patients had a prescription. As new therapies are approved, their impact on SCD-related morbidity and mortality must be evaluated. Improving access to, and education about, disease-modifying therapies like hydroxyurea for both patients and clinicians is essential to improving outcomes."

We present a case of dual fetal and maternal diagnosis by prenatal ES, in a fetus with unexplained anemia and in a pregnant patient with sickle cell disease (SCD) and recurrent unexplained hypoxia. ES identified a novel, likely pathogenic gamma globin variant, HbF Mission Bay HBG2 (c.86T > A, p.Leu29Gln), in both the fetus and mother. Deleterious variants in HBG2 have been associated with cyanosis, hypoxia, methemoglobinemia, and hemolytic anemia that are typically confined to infancy. In the pregnant patient who herself had a separate diagnosis of SCD, the HBG2 variant manifested with hypoxia as an infant herself, recurrent hypoxia in adulthood, and methemoglobinemia during pregnancy due to persistence of HbF. This same variant manifested in the fetus as anemia requiring multiple in utero transfusions as well as neonatal methemoglobinemia after birth."

We used proximity extension assay technology (Olink) to measure 92 plasma proteins involved in inflammation and angiogenesis. Plasma samples were collected from 57 SCD patients (sickle cell anaemia/HbS-β<sup>0</sup> thalassaemia-thalassaemia) in steady-state and 13 healthy ethnicity-matched healthy controls (HCs). From 15 patients, paired samples were collected during both steady-state and vaso-occlusive episodes (VOEs) and from 23 SCD patients longitudinal samples were collected before and after treatment with either voxelotor (n = 10), hydroxyurea (n = 8) or allogeneic haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (n = 5). Fifty plasma proteins were differentially expressed in steady-state SCD patients as compared to HC. These included proteins involved in angiogenesis (i.e. ANGPT1, ANGPT2 and VEGFA), the IL-18 signalling pathway (i.e. IL-6, IL-10, IL-18), T-cell activation (i.e. LAG3, PDCD1) and natural killer (NK)-cell activation (CD244, NCR1, GZMB). While proteins involved in angiogenesis and the IL-18 signalling pathway were further upregulated during VOE, levels of several proteins involved in the IL-18 pathway, T-cell and NK-cell activation and angiogenesis, restored towards levels detected in HCs after curative or disease-modifying treatment. These findings might contribute to a better understanding of SCD pathophysiology and identifying potential new targets for therapeutic interventions."

This study aims to quantify Arabic web educational materials for patients with SCD and provide a descriptive standardized assessment. This retrospective, descriptive study aimed to analyze Arabic websites on SCD through the Discern instrument and JAMA benchmark. We evaluated the quality and reliability of 27 Arabic SCD-related websites. Regarding website content, all 27 (100%) defined sickle cell disease, whereas 25 (96.30%) and 24 (92.59%) illustrated its manifestations and treatments, respectively. However, only 12 (44.44%) discussed the prevention of the disease through premarital genetic screening and counseling. According to the Discern score, 11 (40.74%) websites were of low quality, while 16 (59.26%) were of moderate quality. On the other hand, the JAMA score reveals that only 2 (7.41%) websites were high reliability, while the majority 25 (92.59%) were low reliability. Additionally, analysis revealed a weak positive correlation between the Discern and JAMA scores (correlation coefficient of 0.19). There were no statistically significant differences in the Discern and JAMA scores between websites on the first page of the search results and those on other pages (<i>p</i> = 0.941 and 0.359, respectively). Empowering patients with comprehensive knowledge about various disease aspects is a pivotal component in the effective management of SCD and, consequently, improving its outcomes. Regrettably, there is a notable scarcity of credible and high-quality written web-based health resources available in Arabic despite significant advancements in other clinical aspects of SCD. Augmenting the existing online resources in Arabic patients' native language could yield substantial enhancements in patient care across various dimensions."

    "abstract": "Tanzania is the fifth country with the highest sickle cell disease (SCD) prevalence globally. Although hydroxyurea (HU) is available, only 25% of persons with SCD are reported to use it in Tanzania. Perceived disease threat is associated with medication usage in patients with chronic diseases. We assessed the factors associated with caregivers' perceived threat of SCD complications and its relationship with HU use among children with SCD in Dar-es-Salaam. We conducted a cross-sectional hospital-based study from May to August 2023. We enrolled 374 caregivers of health-insured children with SCD from 4 public SCD clinics. We adapted the modified original and revised Champion's Health Belief Model Scales to derive perceived threat scores. We used Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests to compare the outcomes across sociodemographic characteristics and regression analysis for factors associated with perceived SCD threat. The median score (InterQuartile Range) for perceived threat of SCD complications was 559 (175, 598). Sixty-one percent of caregivers had a high SCD perceived threat. The caregivers of under-five children had 141 lower median SCD threat scores than those of children aged 13-17 years, <i>p-</i>value < 0.001. Participants from Regional Referral Hospitals (RRH) had lower median threat scores compared to participants attending Muhimbili National Hospital (MNH), 177 for Amana RRH, 325 Temeke RRH, 585 MNH Mloganzila, and 557 MNH Upanga, <i>p</i>-value <0.001. Children of caregivers with high perceived SCD threat were 3.4 times more likely to use HU compared to those with low SCD threat perception (Incidence Rate Ratio 3.4, 95% CI: 2.7-4.5). The perceived threat of SCD predicts the likelihood of SCD patients using HU in Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania. We recommend health education to caregivers aiming to improve their SCD threat perception and thus improve the use of HU among children with SCD in similar settings."

The endocannabinoid system (ECS) could be a candidate for modulating SCA complications, such as priapism, as it has demonstrated an essential role in hematopoiesis, platelet aggregation, and immune responses. We evaluated the association of ECS-related single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) (FAAH rs324420, MAGL rs604300, CNR1 rs7766029, and CNR2 rs35761398) with priapism in a Brazilian SCA cohort. The study involved 138 SCA patients (n = 80 with priapism and n = 58 without priapism). SCA was detected with HPLC, and the Hb SS genotype was confirmed with PCR-RE. Alpha thalassemia mutations were detected with Multiplex-PCR, and SNP genotyping was performed using TaqMan genotyping assays. We observed a lower frequency of -α<sup>3.7kb</sup>-thalassemia mutation in patients with priapism than in patients without this complication (p < 0.001), and in adjusted multivariate analyses TT-CC genotype of CNR2 rs35761398 was associated with a lower chance of developing priapism (OR = 0.386 [0.175-0.854], p = 0.019) and a lower risk of it over time (HR = 0.634 [0.402-0.987], p = 0.049). The SCA ischemic priapism is related to unbalanced vasodilation/vasoconstriction pathways, such as decreased RhoA/Rho-kinase (ROCK) signaling. Since activating the type 2 cannabinoid receptor (CB2) decreases RhoA activation, we suggest a novel approach to SCA priapism involving CB2."

Missed appointments place a significant burden on the healthcare system, resulting in prolonged waiting times and underutilized clinical resources that impact the quality of care provided. Individuals with sickle cell disease commonly require multiple appointments to address the myriads of comorbidities associated with their disease. Nevertheless, the sickle cell ophthalmology clinic experienced an alarmingly high no-show rate of 49% from June to September of 2021 despite offering same-day appointments with the hematology clinic. To address this issue, we conducted a study in which we compared the baseline no-show rate with the rate after relocating both clinics to the same floor, aiming to overcome patient-related barriers. Following 3.5 months of the clinics sharing the same floor, the no-show rate decreased to 39%, reflecting a 10% improvement from the baseline rate. In summary, co-locating two related clinics can alleviate patient burdens, foster communication between multidisciplinary specialties, and contribute to an overall improvement in the quality of care and treatment provided."

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) and β-thalassemia patients with elevated gamma globin (HBG1/G2) levels exhibit mild or no symptoms. To recapitulate this natural phenomenon, the most coveted gene therapy approach is to edit the regulatory sequences of HBG1/G2 to reactivate them. By editing more than one regulatory sequence in the HBG promoter, the production of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) can be significantly increased. However, achieving this goal requires precise nucleotide conversions in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) at therapeutic efficiency, which remains a challenge. We employed Cas9 RNP-ssODN-mediated homology-directed repair (HDR) gene editing to mimic two naturally occurring HBG promoter point mutations; -175T > C, associated with high HbF levels, and -158 C > T, a common polymorphism in the Indian population that induces HbF under erythropoietic stress, in HSPCs. Asymmetric, nontarget ssODN induced high rates of complete HDR conversions, with at least 15% of HSPCs exhibiting both the -175T > C and -158 C > T mutations. Optimized conditions and treatment with the small molecule AZD-7648 increased this rate, with up to 57% of long-term engrafting human HSPCs in NBSGW mice containing at least one beneficial mutation. Functionally, in vivo erythroblasts exhibited high levels of HbF, which was sufficient to reverse the cellular phenotype of β-thalassemia. Further support through bone marrow MSC co-culture boosted complete HDR conversion rates to exceed 80%, with minimal InDels, improved cell viability, and induced fetal hemoglobin levels similar to those of Cas9 RNP-mediated indels at BCL11A enhancer and HBG promoter. Cas9 RNP-ssODN-based nucleotide conversion at the HBG promoter offers a promising gene therapy approach to ameliorate the phenotypes of β-thalassemia and SCD. The developed approach can simplify and broaden applications that require the cointroduction of multiple nucleotide modifications in HSPCs."

Unlike other carrier states, SCT is highly prevalent and is found in nearly 3 million Americans, which results in important reproductive implications. Currently, all NBS programs in the US are responsible for their own policies regarding SCT notification, and little is known about how SCT notification practices are performed and how these practices vary across NBS programs. We surveyed NBS programs personnel in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the US' territories of Puerto Rico and Guam (<i>n</i> = 53) using an electronic survey. There was a 100% response rate. All NBS programs (100%) provide notification of SCT status to either a pediatrician or parent: 49% notify the pediatrician only, 45% notify both the pediatrician and parent, and 6% notify the parent only. A total of 98% of NBS programs retain electronic records of SCT status, but only 38% can be directly accessed by pediatricians/primary care doctors. No state operates a publicly available database that allows individuals to access their own records. Only one state provides renotification at reproductive age. In conclusion, there is wide variability in NBS practices for SCT notification. This study demonstrates a need for national guidelines to standardize SCT notification across the US to ensure effective notification and counseling for SCT."

Cross sectional study. In our study, 184 patients (98% African American, mean age 36.5 ± 11.6 years, 63% female) completed the Self-Reported Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs (S-LANNS) and the Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory (NPSI) and provided blood samples for genotyping of the rs4680 SNP. We conducted a cross-sectional association study using a likelihood ratio test that compared a model with and without genotype as a predictor. We also used linear regression model to determine whether the Met allele was associated with pain in an additive model. 50% of the study participants had a Val/Val genotype, 41% had a Val/Met, and 9% had a MET/MET. Between the three rs4680 genotypes, the differences in the mean S-LANNS or NPSI scores were not statistically significant. The Met allele was also not significantly associated with neuropathic pain (S-LANNS p = .23; NPSI p = .73) in an additive SNP model. Further studies with larger samples are needed to determine if the Met/Met genotype predisposes patients with SCD to neuropathic pain and if other polymorphisms in the COMT gene play a role in this process."

This review elucidates the comprehensive applications of NSG in pediatric care, emphasizing its role in early diagnosis and management of pathologies affecting the pediatric head-such as scalp lesions, misshapen calvarium, ventricular distortions, and cerebrovascular abnormalities, and its specific role in conditions like hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE) across different neonatal gestational ages. We explore its diagnostic advantage in critical care settings, particularly for infants with stroke risk in sickle cell disease, ECMO-related complications, screening for therapeutic hypothermia, and routine neonatal intensive care unit monitoring. This review discusses the recommendations based on the timing of brain injury (preterm and term) and describes technical considerations that enhance diagnostic accuracy. Ultimately, this article advocates for its incorporation into routine neonatal screening to improve neurodevelopmental outcomes, underscoring its importance in clinical decision-making and long-term management of pediatric brain disorders."

    "abstract": "Despite extensive research on the impact of stigma on the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of people with sickle cell disease, gaps remain in understanding the mechanisms through which this association occurs. We investigated how stigma impacts HRQoL among people with sickle cell disease (SCD) through distress and the moderating role of social support in this association. Utilizing a cross-sectional design, we sampled 165 people with SCD in Nigeria, who completed relevant measures. Results showed that distress mediated the stigma-HRQoL link, and social support moderated this mediation. Intervention may do well to incorporate psychological therapies and strengthen social support networks to improve the HRQoL of people living with sickle cell disease."

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most common inherited blood disorder worldwide, impacting millions and imposing severe healthcare challenges, particularly in resource-limited regions. Current treatments have variable efficacy and require lifelong adherence. Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation can be curative but comes with significant side effects and limited donor availability limits its widespread applicability. Gene therapy, by addressing the root genetic causes, offers a revolutionary alternative. This article discusses the molecular mechanisms of SCD and β-thalassemia and highlights advancements in gene therapy, such as gene addition via lentiviral vectors and gene editing with CRISPR/Cas9 technology. Clinical trials have brought about significant progress but challenges remain, including leukemogenesis, delivery efficiency and cost. Future efforts must focus on enhancing efficiency, reducing costs, developing nongenotoxic conditioning regimens and methods for in vivo application."

    "title": "Evolving Landscape of Sickle Cell Anemia Management in Africa: A Critical Review.",
    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a prevalent inherited blood disorder, particularly affecting populations in Africa. This review examined the disease's burden, its diverse clinical presentations, and the challenges associated with its management in African settings. Africa bears a significant burden of SCD, with prevalence varying across countries and age groups. Newborn screening programs have highlighted the high prevalence of SCD at birth, emphasizing the need for early diagnosis and intervention. The clinical manifestations of SCD in Africa are multifaceted, encompassing acute complications like vaso-occlusive crises, acute chest syndrome, and stroke, as well as chronic complications such as organ damage and leg ulcers. Biological factors, including fetal hemoglobin levels, and demographic factors, like age and sex, influence disease severity and outcomes. The management of SCD in Africa faces numerous challenges. Limited access to resources, including diagnostic tools, medications, and trained healthcare professionals, hinders optimal care. The high cost of advanced therapies further restricts patient access. Cultural stigma and a lack of awareness create additional barriers to effective management. To address these challenges, early diagnosis through newborn screening programs and point-of-care testing is crucial. Comprehensive care models, including hydroxyurea therapy, pain management, and patient education, are essential for improving outcomes. Collaboration with international networks and leveraging local resources can enhance the sustainability of SCD programs. In conclusion, SCD significantly impacts African populations. Overcoming the challenges associated with its management requires addressing resource limitations, affordability issues, and cultural barriers. Early diagnosis, comprehensive care models, and ongoing research focused on affordability and accessibility are crucial for improving the lives of individuals living with SCD in Africa."

    "title": "Newborn Screening for Six Primary Conditions in a Clinical Setting in Morocco.",
    "abstract": "Newborn screening (NBS) represents an important public health measure for the early detection of specified disorders; such screening can prevent disability and death, not only from metabolic disorders but also from endocrine, hematologic, immune, and cardiac disorders. Screening for critical congenital conditions affecting newborns' health is a great challenge, especially in developing countries such as Morocco, where NBS program infrastructure is lacking. In addition, the consanguinity rate is high in Morocco. This study aimed to demonstrate the feasibility of integrating NBS into a diagnostic laboratory for routine analysis. Six primary severe conditions were included: congenital hypothyroidism (CH), cystic fibrosis (CF), phenylketonuria (PKU), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PD), congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), and hemoglobinopathies. A retrospective investigation was carried out to examine the outcomes of NBS in Casablanca, Morocco. A total of 5511 newborn blood samples were collected via heel-prick sampling and tested for the above disorders. Most of the samples were collected within the third and sixth days of birth. The dried blood spots were analyzed via a quantitative immunofluorescence technique and isoelectric focusing. A total of 72 newborns had one of the six pathological conditions. The most prevalent disorders were hemoglobinopathies, which were identified in 47 newborns (0.9%), with 29 having HbC carrier status (0.5%), 15 having Hb S carrier status (0.3%), and 3 having an Hb Bart's carrier profile (0.05%). This was followed by G6PD deficiency, which was found to affect 16 newborns (0.32% of cases). CF was found in one case (0.02%), whereas five newborns (0.09%) tested positive for CAH. Additionally, two newborns (0.04%) tested positive for CH, and one newborn tested positive for PKU (0.02%). Our findings underscore the importance and success of NBS programs in preventing morbidity and mortality and improving the quality of life of affected neonates. The significant gap in data and research on these disorders within the Moroccan population highlights the urgent need to integrate NBS into routine practice in diagnostic laboratories across Morocco. This integration is crucial for enhancing the health and well-being of Moroccan newborns."

    "abstract": "In France, sickle cell disease newborn screening (SCD NBS) has been targeted to at-risk regions since 1984, but generalization to the whole population will be implemented from November 2024. Although tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) is already used for the NBS of several inherited metabolic diseases, its application for SCD NBS has not been widely adopted worldwide. The aim of this study was to evaluate a dedicated MS/MS kit (Targeted MS/MS Hemo, ZenTech, LaCAR Company, Liege, Belgium) for SCD NBS and to compare the results obtained with those from an NBS reference center using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF) and cation-exchange high-performance liquid chromatography (CE-HPLC, Variant NBS, Biorad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA, USA) as confirmatory method. The MS/MS Hemo kit was used according to the manufacturer's instructions and performed on a Waters Xevo TQ-D (Waters Corporation, USA). The software provided by the manufacturer was used for the calculation and analysis of peptide signal ratios. Among the 1333 samples, the results of 1324 samples were consistent with the HPLC and/or MALDI-TOF results (1263 FA, 50 FAS, 7 FAC, 1 FAO-Arab, and 3 FS). All the discordant results (one FAS on MS/MS vs. FA in CE-HPLC, one FA on MS/MS vs. FAS in CE-HPLC, seven FS on MS/MS vs. FAS in CE-HPLC) were corrected after modifying the peptide signal ratios thresholds, allowing the MS/MS Hemo kit to achieve near-100% sensitivity and specificity for SCD NBS. In conclusion, the MS/MS Hemo kit appears to be an effective method for SCD NBS, particularly for laboratories already equipped with MS/MS technology. However, these results should be confirmed in a larger cohort including a greater number of positive samples for SCD."

    "abstract": "Parental strategies for home management of pain crisis in children with sickle cell anemia are not well studied. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs) are thought of as the mainstay of home and in-patient pain management for pediatric patients with sickle cell disease. Parents and providers often fear the use of opioids due to the risk of addiction. Medical marijuana is a potential adjunct therapy, but parental concerns regarding its use are not known. We aimed to assess parental strategies for home pain control, as well as attitudes toward the use of medical marijuana in children with sickle cell disease. Although medical marijuana may be a safer alternative to opioids, parents had similar concerns regarding marijuana. There were significant concerns regarding the societal implications of marijuana use. Further study of the utility of marijuana is warranted, but clinicians must look beyond the medical and consider the social consequences that may impact treatment acceptability."

    "title": "A Retrospective Analysis of Demographics, Clinical Features, and Treatment Patterns in Sickle Cell Disease Patients at a Tertiary Healthcare Centre of North East India.",
    "abstract": "Background Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a hereditary disorder marked by abnormal hemoglobin (HbS), leading to chronic hemolytic anemia, vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs), and multi-organ complications. In India, the prevalence of SCD is highest among tribal populations in states like Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha, and Assam, with the disease burden exacerbated by limited healthcare access, especially in rural regions. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the demographic profile, clinical features, and treatment patterns of SCD patients at a tertiary healthcare center in Upper Assam, where the prevalence of SCD is high among the tea tribe communities. Methods This retrospective observational study included 250 patients diagnosed with various SCD subtypes who presented with SCD-related complications at Assam Medical College and Hospital between January 2020 and December 2023. Data were obtained from medical records in the departments of medicine and pediatrics, covering demographic variables (age, gender, ethnicity), clinical characteristics (complications, hemoglobin levels, genotype, history of hospitalizations), and treatment details (frequency and type of blood transfusions, use of hydroxyurea and chelating agents). Descriptive statistics summarized demographic and clinical features, while chi-square tests and t-tests were used for bivariate analysis. Logistic regression identified factors associated with high transfusion requirements. Results The study population had a mean age of 17.2 years, with 54.4% male predominance. Most patients (87%) had sickle cell anemia (HbSS), while the remainder had other genotypes including HbSA, HbSE, and sickle cell thalassemia. The most common presenting symptoms were fever (61.2%) and bone/joint pain (48.4%), indicative of VOCs and frequent infections. Pallor (30%) and abdominal pain (25.6%) were also prominent. Half of the patients (125) received hydroxyurea, though its uptake was limited by availability and cost. A high transfusion burden was noted, with 72.4% of patients requiring between five to 12 transfusions annually. However, only 22.4% received chelation therapy to manage iron overload, reflecting the cost constraints in accessing these agents. Laboratory findings indicated a mean hemoglobin level of 7.19 g/dL and elevated serum ferritin levels due to repeated transfusions. The frequency of blood transfusions was higher compared to Western studies, emphasizing the need for more accessible disease-modifying therapies in resource-limited settings. Conclusions The findings of this study illustrate the significant clinical and transfusion burden experienced by SCD patients in Upper Assam. This population relies heavily on blood transfusions due to limited access to hydroxyurea and other advanced therapies. The study underscores a critical need for improved access to hydroxyurea, expanded availability of chelation therapy, and greater healthcare support for managing SCD-related complications in resource-limited settings. As India's National Sickle Cell Anemia Elimination Mission is implemented, regional studies such as this are essential for tailoring public health interventions to meet the specific needs of high-prevalence areas, especially among underserved tribal communities."

Mycoplasma pneumoniae has been increasingly recognized as a potential trigger, particularly in pediatric cases. This case report presents two atypical cases of M. pneumoniae-associated GBS in children in the pediatric intensive care unit setting. The first case involves a 10-year-old boy with pharyngeal-cervical-brachial variant of GBS, presented with descending paralysis and required prolonged mechanical ventilation and tracheostomy. The second case presents a two-year-old boy with ascending GBS complicated by underlying sickle cell anemia. Both cases illustrate that pediatric GBS requires prompt diagnosis and aggressive treatment. In these instances, GBS was linked to M. pneumoniae."

    "abstract": "In many sub-Saharan African countries, it is recommended that children with sickle cell anaemia receive malaria chemoprevention with monthly sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine or daily proguanil as the standard of care. However, the efficacy of these interventions is compromised by high-grade antifolate resistance of Plasmodium falciparum and poor adherence. We aimed to compare the efficacy of weekly dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine and monthly sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine for the prevention of clinical malaria in children with sickle cell anaemia in areas with high-grade sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance of P falciparum in Uganda and Malawi. We did an individually randomised, parallel group, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial at two hospitals in Uganda and two hospitals in Malawi. Children (aged 6 months to 15 years) with sickle cell anaemia with a bodyweight of at least 5kg were randomly assigned (1:1) by computer-generated block randomisation, stratified by site and weight category, to receive either weekly dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (approximately 2·5 mg per kg bodyweight dihydroartemisinin and 20 mg per kg bodyweight per day piperaquine) or monthly sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (approximately 25 mg per kg bodyweight sulfadoxine and 1·25 mg per kg bodyweight). Placebos matching the alternative treatment were used in each treatment group to maintain masking of the different dosing schedules from the participants and caregivers, study staff, investigators, and data analysts. All children younger than 5 years received penicillin twice daily as standard of care. The primary endpoint was the incidence of clinical malaria, defined as a history of fever in the preceding 48 h or documented axillary temperature of 37·5°C or higher plus the detection of P falciparum parasites on microscopy (any parasite density). Secondary efficacy outcomes were any malaria parasitaemia (on either microscopy or malaria rapid diagnostic test), all-cause unscheduled clinic visits, all-cause and malaria-specific hospitalisation, sickle cell anaemia-related events (including vaso-occlusive crises, acute chest syndrome, stroke), need for blood transfusion, and death. All primary and secondary outcomes were assessed in the modified intention-to-treat population, which included all participants who were randomly assigned for whom endpoint data were available. Safety was assessed in in all children who received at least one dose of the study drug. Complete case analysis was conducted using negative-binomial regression. This study was registered with Clinicaltrials.gov, NCT04844099. Between April 17, 2021, and May 30, 2022, 725 participants were randomly assigned; of whom 724 were included in the primary analysis (367 participants in the dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine group and 357 participants in the sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine group). The median follow-up time was 14·7 months (IQR 11·2-18·2). The incidence of clinical malaria was 8·8 cases per 100 person-years in the dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine group and 43.7 events per 100 person-years in the sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine group (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 0·20 [95% CI 0·14-0·30], p<0·0001). The incidence of hospitalisation with any malaria was lower in the dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine group than the sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine group (10·4 vs 37·0 events per 100 person-years; IRR 0·29 [0·20-0·42], p<0·0001) and the number of blood transfusions was also lower in the dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine group than the sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine group (52·1 vs 72·5 events per 100 person-years; IRR 0·70 [0·54-0·90], p=0·006). The incidence of all-cause unscheduled clinic visits and all-cause hospitalisations were similar between the two groups, however, participants in the dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine group had more clinic visits unrelated to malaria (IRR 1·12 [1·00-1·24], p=0·042) and more hospitalisations with lower respiratory tract events (16·5 vs 8·5 events per 100 person-years; IRR 1·99 [1·25-3·16], p=0·0036) than participants in the sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine group. The number of serious adverse events in the dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine group was similar to that in the sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine group (vaso-occlusive crisis [154 of 367 participants dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine group vs 132 of 357 participants in the sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine group] and suspected sepsis [115 participants vs 92 participants]), with the exception of acute chest syndrome or pneumonia (51 participants vs 32 participants). The number of deaths were similar between groups (six [2%] of 367 participants in the dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine group and eight (2%) of 357 participants in the sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine group). Malaria chemoprophylaxis with weekly dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine in children with sickle cell anaemia is safe and considerably more efficacious than monthly sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine. However, monthly sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine was associated with fewer episodes of non-malaria-related illnesses, especially in children 5 years or older not receiving penicillin prophylaxis, which might reflect its antimicrobial effects. In areas with high P falciparum antifolate resistance, dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine should be considered as an alternative to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine for malaria chemoprevention in children younger than 5 years with sickle cell anaemia receiving penicillin-V prophylaxis. However, there is need for further studies in children older than 5 years. Research Council of Norway and UK Medical Research Council.

Hydroxyurea, a commonly used disease-modifying therapy, may reduce SCVI resulting in potential impact on reducing stroke and cognitive dysfunction. We aim to test the impact of daily hydroxyurea therapy on these outcomes in Ugandan children with SCA. We hypothesized that hydroxyurea therapy over 36 months will prevent, stabilize or improve these complications of SCA. The BRAIN SAFE II study is an open label, single arm trial of daily hydroxyurea in 270 children with SCA (HbSS) in Uganda, ages 3-9 years. Following baseline assessments, participants began hydroxyurea therapy and are followed according to local guidelines. Standard hydroxyurea dose is escalated to maximum tolerated dose (MTD). SCVI is assessed by cerebral arterial velocity using Doppler ultrasound, with cognitive function determined by formal neurocognitive testing (primary outcomes). Structural SCVI is assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and angiography (MRA) in a sub-sample of 90 participants ages >5 years. At trial midpoint (18 months) and completion (36 months), outcomes of age-specific assessments will be compared to baseline, as well as biomarkers of anemia, inflammation and malnutrition (secondary outcomes) to determine their relationships to primary outcomes. This trial will examine the impact of hydroxyurea on preventing or ameliorating SCA SCVI in children, assessed by reducing incident stroke, stroke risk and neurocognitive dysfunction. Trial results will provide critical insight into the role of hydroxyurea therapy on critical manifestations of SCVI in children with SCA. https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04750707 (registered 11 February 2021).

    "abstract": "Small molecules and antibodies have dominated the pharmaceutical landscape for decades. However, limitations associated with therapeutic targets deemed \"undruggable\" and progress in biology and chemistry have led to the blossoming of drug modalities and therapeutic approaches. In 2023, a high number of 9 oligonucleotide and peptide products were approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), accounting for 16% of all drugs approved. Additionally, for the first time, a clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-Cas9 gene therapy product was approved for the treatment of sickle cell disease. New drug modalities possess a wide range of physicochemical properties and structures, which complicates their analytical characterization. Impurities are formed at each step of the oligonucleotide and peptide solid phase synthesis and during shelf life. Longer chain lengths lead to a higher number of closely related impurities that become increasingly more difficult to separate from the full-length product. Chemical modifications such as phosphorothioates (PS) result in the presence of diastereomers, which often require orthogonal methods for their profiling and strategies to prevent their interference with the separation of achiral impurities. In-vitro produced mRNA and plasmid DNA also present a variety of quality attributes that need to be determined, such as the polyA tail length or capping efficiency. Analytical challenges arise from the variety of drug modality physiochemical properties and attributes, fast turnaround times, and heightened level of characterization needed to enable data-driven decisions early in the drug development process. This perspective provides the author's views on the lessons learned and strategies employed in recent years."

Disease self-management skills have been recognized as important mediators of poor health outcomes, but transition-related skills such as scheduling appointments and understanding the shift in health care responsibilities remain under taught in the healthcare system. The purpose of this quality improvement (QI) study was to (1) understand the areas of disease self-management that AYA patients felt underprepared for, and (2) design and evaluate an educational program addressing the top unmet skills. The Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) model was implemented in a tertiary outpatient clinic between September 2020 and July 2021. Patients were surveyed during regular clinic visits to identify their priorities on disease self-management skills. Based on the results, a virtual workshop was created and administered three separate times. Feedback was collected using an electronic survey. 'Navigating the adult health care system' was the top self-management skill that AYA patients (n = 39) identified needing more support with. The majority of participants (79%, n = 14) reported that the virtual workshop was excellent, with 'appointment management' being the most useful topic discussed. Participants also reported feeling more confident (71%) and aware (86%) of how to navigate adult care. This QI study showed that delivering a virtual workshop on transition skills was well received by AYA participants with SCD. The PDSA framework was useful for identifying specific knowledge gaps in transition aged AYA to help improve patient education in a well-established transition program."

Effective transition preparation is crucial to address these issues. We established a multidisciplinary transition clinic at our urban SCD center in the fall of 2021. At each visit patients were introduced to the transition process and met with a pediatric and adult SCD provider. We reviewed charts of patients attending the clinic from September 2021 to May 2023. Data were collected on the number of visits in the transition and adult SCD clinics. Clinic notes were reviewed, identifying the main topics of discussion, and examining patient attitudes and feelings towards transition. Twenty-two patients aged 20-27 years with 35 total visits were included in the analysis. Eighteen (82%) patients had at least 1 visit to transition clinic. Out of 10 scheduled patients, 8 attended their first adult care visit within 2.4 months of their last transition visit. Medical topics brought up by patients included difficulty remembering to take hydroxyurea, questions about reproductive and menstrual health, and support pursing higher education with a chronic disease. Patients expressed a variety of feelings about transition from \"no concerns\" to \"nervousness\" and questioning \"what to expect\". Concerns were alleviated by learning about the process. One patient reported feeling \"much better\" after being introduced to the adult provider. We demonstrated that a collaborative transition clinic prepares young adults with SCD for transition to adult care. Meeting with their adult SCD provider prior to transfer helped alleviate patients' concerns. Future work will involve tracking patients as they integrate into adult clinic."

Emerging adults with SCD also have the highest rates of hospitalizations, emergency room visits, and hospital readmissions compared to other age groups. Community health worker (CHW) programs have been developed to address outcomes such as patient activation which includes an individual's knowledge, skill, and confidence for managing one's health and healthcare, quality of life, and healthcare utilization for patients with chronic illnesses. However, few programs specifically target transition-age patients with SCD. The aims of this study were to (1) create and adapt the existing Penn Center for Community Health Workers IMPaCT model trainings and materials to specifically support CHWs working with transition-age patients with SCD and (2) evaluate the feasibility of this adapted model to improve job readiness of the CHWs and perceived value of the CHWs by patients with SCD. A multidisciplinary workgroup defined specific goal-setting categories and developed a targeted CHW training curriculum. Additionally, the workgroup wrote a job manual including step-by-step guidelines with example talking points and defined an ongoing supervision of CHWs. Measures of implementation and impact on CHW job readiness included CHW training completion, job retention, knowledge evaluation, and patient reported CHW engagement. 15 individuals completed CHW training with an average employment length of 1 year and 4 months. 7 (47%) CHWs had research experience, 8 (53%) had clinical experience, and 11 (73%) reported SCD experience. On post-training knowledge evaluations, CHWs successfully identified key aspects of SCD, role scope, and research ethics. Patients frequently reported that they reached their goals while working with trained CHWs. This CHW training program provides a novel adaptation to the evidence-based IMPaCT CHW model to support the needs of youth with SCD during the vulnerable time of transition from pediatric-focused to adulthood-focused healthcare."

The Integrate, Design, Assess, Share (IDEAS) framework, emphasizing user insights, iterative design, rigorous assessment, and knowledge sharing, guided the development process. The design team consisted of researchers, psychologists, physicians, social workers, AYA with SCD, and parents of AYA with SCD (n = 16) across three states. Qualitative focus groups and interviews were conducted and analyzed using thematic analysis across the integrate and design phases. Point of use feedback from AYA with SCD was used to assess feasibility and acceptability. The development process was centered around tenants of the Social-ecological Model of Adolescent and Young Adult Readiness to Transition. Development integrated multidisciplinary perspectives, fostering a person-centered approach. The iterative design process involved collaboration with a digital health firm, Agency39A. Health equity and implementation considerations were addressed at individual, community, and healthcare system levels. Themes that emerged from focus groups with AYA, clinicians, and researchers in the integrate and design phases of development included recommendations for content and user experience features. iManage SCD emerges as a comprehensive, user-friendly mobile health application, incorporating theoretical principles and direct user input.

Although they prevent disease pathophysiology of HbS polymerization and red blood cell (RBC) sickling by increasing hemoglobin oxygen affinity, higher oxygen affinity can also cause transient tissue hypoxia with compensatory increases in erythropoiesis and subsequent increases in RBC turnover. CD-1 mice treated with an HbS modulator for 2 weeks developed higher RBC mass, increased erythropoiesis, and, by 1 month, deposition of intracellular pigments in renal tubular and parietal epithelium. In addition, in mice treated for 26 weeks, pigment was observed in MCs, which was accompanied by glomerular cell aggregates (MC hypercellularity) and tubulo-interstitial inflammation. The pigment was confirmed by Perl's iron staining and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to be iron-containing proteins. Glomerular cell aggregates were confirmed to be MCs by TEM, and Ki-67 immunolabeling suggested that MC hypercellularity was due to proliferation. Collectively, these findings, along with iron-containing proteins in livers and spleens, suggested that iron overload secondary to increased RBC turnover led to increased renal iron reabsorption. While both MC hypercellularity and tubulo-interstitial inflammation were thought to be responses to long-term accumulation of iron, the former was considered a homeostatic response to eliminate iron, and maintain glomerular structure and function, while the latter was more consistent with an iron-catalyzed oxidative stress response. To our knowledge, this is the first report of MC hypercellularity in a preclinical toxicity study."

    "abstract": "A few shave identified systemic and hematologic risk factors for Proliferative Sickle Cell Retinopathy (PSR) development. The relevance of healthcare utilization as a risk factor for PSR has not been defined. This study evaluates patterns of healthcare utilization among patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) and retinopathy. A retrospective study of adults with SCD, using EMR, was conducted from January 2017 to December 2019, seen at the Montefiore Medical Center eye clinic. Four hundred twelve patients with SCD were included in this analysis (65.8% HbSS (SS)) and 34.2% HbSC (SC). HBSS patients had higher utilization of hematology outpatient visits and inpatient admissions than HBSC. For individuals with either HBSC or HBSS disease, higher outpatient healthcare utilization was associated with higher number of inpatient admissions. The prevalence of retinopathy was 24% and 55% in SS and SC patients respectively, with PSR in 60% SS and 87.6% SC of these patients. Patients with HBSC with higher outpatient visits and inpatient admissions experienced significantly lower PSR rates. In contrast, for patients with HBSS, higher outpatient visits were significantly associated with higher PSR prevalence. Healthcare utilization patterns in individuals with HBSS and HBSC varied according to their prevalence of PSR. These differences may be useful in stratifying patients' risk for retinopathy development and in deciding follow-up eye examination frequency."

    "abstract": "Children with sickle cell disease (SCD) have increased stroke risk, identifiable by elevated velocities on transcranial Doppler (TCD). This review assessed the impact of TCD screening on stroke, mortality, quality of life and morbidity in children with SCD. A systematic search of MEDLINE, PubMed, Cochrane libraries, and trial registries was conducted from inception to 28th February 2023. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomised studies (NRS) were included. A meta-analysis and narrative synthesis were performed. Nine studies were included in the review. In one RCT, initiating chronic blood transfusion in children with abnormal TCD velocities reduced stroke risk by 92 %, while no deaths were reported. Pooled results from three NRS indicated TCD screening leads to four fewer strokes per 1000 patients annually. No studies analysing morbidity nor quality of life were identified. TCD screening may decrease the risk of stroke in patients with SCD."

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease is one of the most common autosomal recessive genetic disorders with 23% and over 70% of men with this condition, experiencing episodes of ischaemic priapism and stuttering priapism, respectively, with potentially severe consequences. The effective prevention of sickle cell disease induced ischaemic priapism and stuttering priapism requires a multidisciplinary and multimodal approach. A search of the English literature was performed utilising Pubmed® and Google Scholar to identify publications on contemporary and novel treatment options, with their associated treatment outcomes if available, that are utilised to prevent stuttering priapism episodes and hence a fulminant ischaemic priapism. This narrative review focuses on three main aspects which include firstly, patient education and lifestyle modifications. Secondly, strategies aimed at preventing stuttering priapism episodes with traditional treatments such as alpha-adrenergic agonists and hormone manipulation strategies among others. Finally, we review treatments utilised to treat the underlying sickle cell disease with contemporary options such as hydroxyurea to more novel therapies such as crizanlizumab and voxelotor. The role of potentially curative techniques such as gene therapy and stem cell transplantation are also reviewed and summarised."

Drawing on African epistemologies such as ubuntu and ujamaa and on our collective experiences in genomics and big data research for sickle cell disease, hearing impairment, and fragile X syndrome and the project Public Understanding of Big Data in Genomics Medicine in Africa, we envision a transformative shift in health research data governance in Africa that could help create a sense of shared responsibility between all stakeholders in genomics and data-driven health research in Africa. This shift includes proposing a social contract for genomics and data science in health research that is grounded in African communitarianism such as solidarity, shared decision-making, and reciprocity. We make several recommendations for a social contract for genomics and data science in health, including the coproduction of genomics knowledge with study communities, power sharing between stakeholders, public education on the ethical and social implications of genetics and data science, benefit sharing, giving voice to data subjects through dynamic consent, and democratizing data access to allow wide access by all research stakeholders. Achieving this would require adopting participatory approaches to genomics and data governance."

    "abstract": "In children and adults with sickle-cell disease (SCD), acute ischemic stroke (AIS) associated with a vaso-occlusive crisis is a leading cause of physical and cognitive disability and death. However, neurological guidelines for acute management of AIS fail to directly address this issue. We here report a case of a man with severe cerebrovascular complications and illustrate the current evidence on the management of SCD-related AIS. A 46-year-old man suffering from SCD and poorly controlled diabetes was admitted to the emergency room complaining of the onset, more than 10 h before, of headache, paresthesia, and right hemianopia. The brain Angio-CT study revealed bilateral occlusion of the internal carotids and the posterior cerebral arteries, with remarkable compensatory hypertrophy of other vessels. The laboratory exams confirmed severe anemia with high hemoglobin-S levels (50%) and severe dehydration. IV hydration was prompted, along with erythrocyte apheresis and antiplatelet therapy. The patient successfully underwent these treatments, and the neurological deficits significantly improved. Nonetheless, due to the time window, he could not be treated with intravenous thrombolysis (IVT). AIS is a time-sensitive condition. In SCD, vaso-occlusive phenomena are the leading cause of AIS, but \"classical\" vascular risk factors can also play a role. Since current guidelines on the acute management of SCD complications are mainly focused on the hematological- rather than neurological- aspects, it is not clear whether these patients should undergo IVT before or after fluid resuscitation and erythrocyte apheresis. Furthermore, the principles of secondary prophylaxis are still controversial and require further investigation."

    "abstract": "Hip deformity is frequent after childhood osteonecrosis in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). When they are adults, they present a challenge as candidates for total hip arthroplasty (THA) because of abnormal bone development, their relative youth, and also because of their disease. Performing subtrochanteric osteotomy associated with THA is technically challenging, and healing of osteotomies has never been reported in this population with frequent osteonecrotic bone, whether using cemented or uncemented arthroplasties. We retrospectively analyzed 59 cemented THA with femoral corrective osteotomies (subtrochanteric shortening and transverse derotational osteotomy) performed on hip deformities between 1984 and 2018 in 59 sickle cell adult patients. The patient's age at the onset of osteonecrosis was an average of 8.4 years (6 to 10 years), and at the time of the THA was 28.6 years (19 to 41 years). All the patients had a minimum followup period of six years. Endocrinopathy was frequently associated to SCD Data and consequences were evaluated on bone union. The mechanical variables, such as the length of the resected femur, limb lengthening, the location of the osteotomy site, the size of the stem bridging the osteotomy, and any complications, were also analyzed. The average length of the resected femoral segment was 38.4 mm. The length of the femoral stem (bridging the osteotomy) was average 13 cm. The mean osteotomy union time was 10.6 months. Twenty-four osteotomies healed in six months, six in nine months, and 29 in twelve months, while five required bone grafts at nine months. The union time of the osteotomy was average 10.6 months. Complications included four cases of transient nerve palsy, and five intraoperative femur perforations. No statistically significant relationship was found between osteotomy union time and mechanical variables. The severity of endocrinopathy associated with sickle cell disease prolonged the healing time. In three cases, cement leakage into the osteotomy gap occurred without resulting in non-healing. Cemented THA, combined with a subtrochanteric femoral shortening with transverse derotational osteotomy, has a long union time but is effective for adult hip deformities of patients with sickle cell patients."

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a hemoglobinopathy resulting in hemoglobin-S production, hemolytic anemia, and elevated stroke risk. Treatments include oral hydroxyurea, blood transfusions, and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Our objective was to evaluate the neurologic relevance of these therapies by characterizing how treatment-induced changes in hemoglobin (Hb) affect brain health biomarkers. In this interventional study, adults with and without SCD underwent a 3T-MRI at Vanderbilt University Medical Center at 2 time points before and after clinically indicated transfusion or HSCT or at 2 time points without the introduction of a new Hb-altering therapy (adult controls and patients with SCD on hydroxyurea). Cerebral blood flow (CBF; mL/100 g/min) and cerebral venous blood relaxation rate (s<sup>-1</sup>; a marker of Hb and blood oxygen content) responses were assessed to understand how these markers of brain health vary with Hb modulation. CBF was assessed with arterial spin labeling MRI, and blood relaxation rate was assessed using T<sub>2</sub> relaxation under spin tagging MRI. Measures were pairwise compared within each cohort using a 2-tailed Wilcoxon signed-rank test, and regression was applied to evaluate the parameter and Hb change relationships. The significance criterion was 2-sided <i>p</i> < 0.05. Adults with (n = 43; age 28.7 ± 7.7 years; 42% male) and without (n = 13; age 33.5 ± 12.2 years; 46% male) SCD were evaluated. In adults receiving hydroxyurea (n = 10), neither Hb, CBF, nor venous relaxation rate changed between time 1 (Hb = 8.6 ± 1.2 g/dL) and time 2 (Hb = 9.0 ± 1.8 g/dL) (all <i>p</i> > 0.05). In transfusion patients (n = 19), Hb increased from 8.2 ± 1.4 g/dL to 9.3 ± 1.3 g/dL before vs after transfusion (<i>p</i> < 0.001), paralleling a CBF decrease of 14.2 mL/100 g/min (<i>p</i> < 0.001) toward control levels. The venous relaxation rate did not change after transfusion (<i>p</i> = 0.71). In HSCT patients (n = 14), Hb increased from 8.9 ± 1.9 g/dL to 12.9 ± 2.7 g/dL (<i>p</i> < 0.001) before vs after transplant, paralleling CBF decreases from 68.16 ± 20.24 to 47.43 ± 12.59 mL/100 g/min (<i>p</i> < 0.001) and increase in venous relaxation rate (<i>p</i> = 0.004). Across the Hb spectrum, a CBF decrease of 5.02 mL/100 g/min per g/dL increase in Hb was observed. Findings demonstrate improvement in cerebral hemodynamics after transfusion and transplant therapies compared with hydroxyurea therapy; quantitative relationships should provide a framework for using these measures as trial end points to assess how new SCD therapies affect brain health."

    "abstract": "Sickle cell retinopathy (SCR) is a complication of sickle cell disease (SCD) and can drastically impair visual acuity. Screening for SCR is, therefore, recommended, but evidence for optimal screening frequency on an individual level is lacking. This scoping review mapped the current evidence on risk factors for SCR and sickle cell maculopathy (SCM). A literature search (in Medline [Ovid]), Embase [Ovid]), and Scopus) resulted in 67 included articles which covered demographic risk factors, genetic risk factors, systemic therapy, correlations with other forms of SCD-related organ damage, and hematologic risk factors. SCR risk factors include older age, male sex, HbSC genotype, hemolysis, and HbF% <15% (in HbSS) and increased blood viscosity (in HbSC). For SCM, risk factors are older age, HbSS genotype, and higher degree of hemolysis. The pathophysiology of SCR and SCM appears multifactorial, but distinct patterns emerge suggesting that vaso-occlusion and hemolysis cause SCM and NPSCR in HbSS, while hyperviscosity in HbSC leads to peripheral retinopathy. We recommend yearly screening for high-risk patients (older HbSC males) and triennial screening for low-risk patients (young females HbSS with HbF>15%) to ensure comprehensive yet proportionate ophthalmic care. However, future studies are needed on the role of interventions for SCR and the long-term consequences of SCM in order to evaluate and define appropriate screening schedules."

    "title": "A Cross-Sectional Study on the Quality of Life of Adults With Sickle Cell Disease Followed-Up in Outpatient Clinics: A Single-Center Experience.",
    "abstract": "Background Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic blood disorder characterized by abnormal hemoglobin S, leading to red blood cell deformities, chronic hemolysis, and frequent vaso-occlusive crises (VOC). While advancements in medical care have improved survival rates, adults with SCD continue to face substantial challenges in their quality of life (QoL) due to chronic pain, recurrent VOCs, and various complications. This study aimed to evaluate the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in adult patients aged 14 years and above with SCD and identify key factors influencing patient outcomes using the Adult Sickle Cell Quality of Life Measurement Information System (ASCQ-Me). Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted at the Prince Sultan Oncology Center, King Salman Northwest Armed Forces Hospital, Tabuk, Saudi Arabia, between December 2019 and May 2020. The study population comprised adult SCD patients attending outpatient clinics. The QoL was assessed using the ASCQ-Me Short Form, which evaluates five domains: emotional impact, social functioning, pain impact, sleep impact, and stiffness impact. Additionally, a nine-item SCD Medical History Checklist was used to evaluate complications and treatments. Data were collected through structured one-on-one interviews. Scores were transformed into T-scores (mean = 50, standard deviation (SD) = ±10) based on standardized guidelines. Inferential analysis was conducted to compare QoL domains between groups stratified by VOC frequency and severity using the Mann-Whitney U test, with a significance threshold of p ≤ 0.05. Results A total of 53 adult SCD patients were surveyed, with the majority aged 25-34 years (50%). Gender distribution was nearly equal, with 50.9% male participants. The prevalence of complications was notable, with 31% reporting chronic pain, 26% reporting gallstones, and 9% reporting avascular necrosis. Laboratory findings revealed a mean hemoglobin level of 8.63 g/dL (SD: 1.59) and an average fetal hemoglobin (HbF) level of 10.59% (SD: 5.64). The frequency of VOCs varied, with 30% of patients reporting no VOC in the past year, while 57% experienced two to three VOCs. Patients with higher VOC frequency (≥4 per year) reported significantly lower scores across all QoL domains except stiffness (p < 0.05). Higher VOC severity was associated with poorer sleep quality and social functioning (p < 0.05). Pain severity was also a critical determinant, with more than 55% of patients rating their last pain episode as severe or extreme. Conclusion The study highlights the significant burden of pain and VOCs on the quality of life in adult SCD patients. Frequent VOCs and chronic complications such as avascular necrosis and gallstones were major contributors to reduced HRQoL. Findings emphasize the need for comprehensive, multidisciplinary care approaches targeting pain management, psychological support, and functional independence. The ASCQ-Me tool proved valuable for identifying specific domains of impairment and guiding patient-centered interventions. Future research should focus on longitudinal studies to explore the efficacy of tailored interventions and address the ongoing challenges faced by this vulnerable population."

    "abstract": "Over the past years, many significant advances have been made in the field of gene therapy and shown promising results in clinical trials conducted. Gene therapy aims at modifying or replacing a defective, inefficient, or nonfunctional gene with a healthy, functional gene by administration of genome material into the cell to cure genetic diseases. Various methods have been devised to do this by using several viral and non-viral vectors which are either administered by in vivo or ex vivo technique. Viral vectors are best suitable for this therapy due to their potential to invade cells and deliver their genetic material whereas non-viral vectors are less efficient than viral vectors but possess some advantages such as less immunogenic response and large gene carrying capacity. Recent advances in biotechnology such as CRISPR-Cas9 mediated genome engineering and Cancer treatment with Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy are addressed in this review. This review article also delves into some recent research studies, gene therapy trials, and its applications, laying out future hopes for gene therapy in the treatment of various diseases namely haemophilia, Muscular dystrophy, SCID, Sickle cell disease, Familial Hypercholesterolemia, Cystic Fibrosis.

    "abstract": "Individuals with sickle cell disease (SCD) have a unique type of dyslipidemia characterized by low total cholesterol (TC), low low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c), and normal triglycerides (TG). This lipid state is theorized to be cardioprotective against atherosclerosis. In SCD, hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) offers a potentially curative therapy. Long-term survivors of HCT for hematologic malignancies are at increased risk for dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis long-term. The effects of HCT on SCD dyslipidemia are unknown. This retrospective cohort study characterizes lipid profiles at baseline and after nonmyeloablative allogeneic HCT for SCD. We analyzed data from 116 patients after nonmyeloablative HLA-matched sibling or haploidentical HCT for SCD at the NIH from 2009 to 2021. TC, HDL-c, LDL-c, and TG were collected pre-HCT, 1-year post-HCT, and annually thereafter. Data were analyzed using linear generalized estimating equation regression modeling. Successful HCT was associated with a rise in TC, LDL-c, and HDL-c and a decline in TG post-HCT. After HCT, previously low lipid levels increased to the normal range. These changes occurred within the first year of HCT and were maintained thereafter. In patients with graft failure, TC and LDL-c levels remain unchanged from their pre-HCT baseline. Sirolimus use for graft versus host disease prophylaxis was associated with higher TG levels. These findings suggest that SCD dyslipidemia resolves with reversal of the SCD phenotype. The normalization of lipid parameters suggests SCD patients are not at increased risk for atherosclerosis after successful HCT compared to their peers; further studies with longer follow-up are required."

    "abstract": "<i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i> is a leading cause of pneumonia, meningitis, and invasive pneumococcal disease among adults in the United States, with higher rates of disease occurring among individuals with chronic medical and immunocompromising conditions. Pregnant individuals, especially those with comorbid conditions, are also at increased risk of infection due to <i>S. pneumoniae</i> due to physiological and immunologic changes in pregnancy. Vaccination against pneumococcus is recommended for adults living with HIV aged 19 to 49, congenital or acquired immunodeficiency, asplenia, chronic renal failure, sickle cell disease, alcohol abuse, cerebrospinal fluid leaks, congestive heart failure and cardiomyopathies, chronic lung disease, chronic liver disease, and diabetes mellitus. During pregnancy, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends vaccination against <i>S. pneumoniae</i> for individuals meeting the criteria for immunization outside of pregnancy. Pneumococcal vaccine uptake has been low. There are no data available for vaccine uptake in pregnancy, but we suspect it is lower than nonpregnant populations. Low uptake of immunization rates in pregnancy is likely multifactorial and includes general vaccine hesitancy among pregnant individuals, cost, access to care, and supply shortages. While data in support of pneumococcal vaccines during pregnancy are limited, sufficient evidence exists to support the safety and efficacy of vaccination in the antepartum period. Pregnancy provides an opportunity to continuously engage individuals in care, allowing obstetricians and gynecologists to establish rapport, work to reduce vaccine hesitancy, and to provide pneumococcal immunization to those who are eligible. Medical indications for pneumococcal vaccination will increasingly apply to pregnant persons as the population acquires comorbidities and there is a need for improved education among obstetricians on the topic of antenatal pneumococcal vaccination. KEY POINTS: · Pregnant persons are at risk of S. pneumoniae.. · Adult pneumococcal vaccine uptake has been low.. · Obstetricians and gynecologists can benefit from education on pneumococcal vaccines.. · Encourage pneumococcal vaccines for eligible pregnant people.."

NHLBI expert consensus recommends a CXR in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) who have fever and respiratory symptoms. Past work has shown that physicians fail to recognize ACS in children with SCD who present with fever, leading to varied CXR obtainment criteria. To determine the prevalence of ACS in patients with SCD presenting to our ED with fever with or without respiratory symptoms. A retrospective analysis of ED visits by patients with SCD (ages 0 to 20 years) who presented with fever (>/= 38.5<sup>o</sup> C) within the past 24 h between January 2019 to December 2022 was done. The presence or absence of NHLBI-defined respiratory symptoms and CXR results were extracted. The prevalence of ACS, demonstrated on CXR, for febrile children with and without respiratory symptoms was estimated. There were 137 children (288 unique ED visits) with fever. We found 0 % of visits with fever and no respiratory symptoms had ACS whereas 22.6 % with at least 1 respiratory symptom (p < 0.001). Our findings provide strong evidence that a CXR is not necessary in a child with SCD presenting to the ED with fever and no NHLBI-defined respiratory symptoms.

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a monogenic disease, resulting from a single-point mutation, that presents a complex pathophysiology and high clinical heterogeneity. Inflammation stands as a prominent characteristic of SCD. Over the past few decades, the role of different cells and molecules in the regulation of the inflammatory process has been elucidated. In conjunction with the polymerization of hemoglobin S (HbS), intravascular hemolysis, which releases free heme, HbS, and hemoglobin-related damage-associated molecular patterns, initiates multiple inflammatory pathways that are not yet fully comprehended. These complex phenomena lead to a vicious cycle that perpetuates vaso-occlusion, hemolysis, and inflammation. To date, few inflammatory biomarkers can predict disease complications; conversely, there is a plethora of therapies that reduce inflammation in SCD, although clinical outcomes vary widely. Importantly, whether the clinical heterogeneity and complications are related to the degree of inflammation is not known. This review aims to further our understanding of the roles of main immune cells, and other inflammatory factors, as potential prognostic biomarkers for predicting clinical outcomes or identifying novel treatments for SCD."

Key predictors of poor HRQoL among SCA children included frequent pain episodes (>3 episodes in the past 12 months; odds ratio [OR] = 1.9, <i>p</i> = 0.028), late diagnosis of SCA (OR = 1.8, <i>p</i> = 0.012), and clinical stroke (OR = 69.3, <i>p</i> = 0.037). This study demonstrates that SCA significantly reduces HRQoL in all domains. Early diagnosis, effective pain management, and prevention of complications like stroke are critical to improving outcomes. Tailored interventions are needed to mitigate the physical and psychosocial burdens of SCA among children in The Gambia."

    "title": "Nationwide survey on awareness of consanguinity and genetic diseases in Saudi Arabia: challenges and potential solutions to reduce the national healthcare burden.",
    "abstract": "Consanguineous marriage is a major contributing factor for many genetic diseases and a burden to the healthcare system and national economy due to costly long-term care. Earlier studies highlighted the significantly limited awareness of the higher prevalence of genetic disease due to consanguinity even among the educated Arabs. In Saudi Arabia, more than 50% of marriages are between first cousins. This national study aims to gauge the level of the public awareness regarding the consanguinity and its impact on prevalence of genetic diseases across the Saudi Arabia. A cross-sectional bilingual online survey was conducted across Saudi Arabia, distributed through a variety of social media platforms for all residents. Pooled summary data was used from the participants. Majority of the 9191 participants are < 30 years of age (72.85%), single (61.35%), women (74.12%) and college educated (77.16%). Consanguineous marriages are common in the extended family of 61.24% of participants. Though majority of them (85.45%) recognise the higher genetic disease risk associated with consanguinity, low awareness among men was observed (76.61 vs 88.53%). Sickle cell anaemia and thalassemia were not considered as genetic diseases by 60.68% of males and 48.39% of females, though they are the most common genetic diseases in Saudi Arabia. More women are aware of the carrier screening tests than men (42.62 vs 34.56%). Only 6.87% know the rationale behind the national mandatory premarital screening tests and the diseases screened. Although almost all (99.18%) are active users of the social media, 47.77% of men and 57.17% of women use them to search for health-related information. The present study, one of the largest national surveys in highly consanguineous society, highlights that even the young and college-educated participants have low awareness of the genetic disease burden, which is strikingly high in all corners of the country. Social media platforms can be used by genetic professionals and national organizations to disseminate the reliable educational material to the public to reduce the national healthcare and economic burden in the future."

    "title": "Hydroxyurea blunts mitochondrial energy metabolism and osteoblast and osteoclast differentiation exacerbating trabecular bone loss in sickle cell mice.",
    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a severe hematological disorder characterized by erythrocyte sickling that causes significant morbidity and mortality. Skeletal complications of SCD include a high incidence of bone loss, especially in vertebrae, leading to fragility fractures that contribute to disease burden. Whether hydroxyurea (HU), a front-line therapy for SCD ameliorates bone disease has not been established. To investigate HU action on SCD-related vertebral defects, we used HU-treated \"Townes\" mice, an SCD animal model and performed high-resolution micro-computed tomography (µCT) imaging to resolve bone volume and micro-architectural structure of cortical and trabecular bone, the two major compartments contributing to bone mass and strength. Our data revealed that cortical bone was significantly diminished in the vertebrae of skeletally mature (representing adults) and immature (representing children) SCD mice, while only mature mice lost trabecular bone mass. Administration of HU ameliorated cortical bone loss in mature SCD mice, but paradoxically promoted trabecular bone decline in both groups. We further investigated the mechanisms of HU action in wild-type C57BL6/J mice. HU caused dose-dependent trabecular bone loss due to diminished osteoclast and osteoblast function, indicative of a low bone turnover state. Mechanistic investigations in vitro revealed that HU impeded osteoblast-progenitor proliferation and early differentiation, and diminished osteoclastogenic cytokine production, blunting osteoclast formation as well as the activity of mature osteoclasts. HU further, suppressed mitochondrial, but not glycolytic energy metabolism in both differentiating osteoblasts and differentiated osteoclasts. Collectively, these findings reveal that despite ameliorating cortical bone loss, HU inhibits trabecular bone formation and resorption, by suppressing mitochondrial energy metabolism and blunting the differentiation and/or activity of osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Together HU drives a low bone turnover state culminating in trabecular bone loss. Further investigation into HU's impact on bone in SCD patients is warranted for understanding and managing skeletal complications in this population."

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic condition affecting approximately 5 % of the global population, with significant prevalence in sub-Saharan Africa and an estimated 89,079 cases in the United States. Osteonecrosis, particularly of the femoral head (ONFH), is a common orthopaedic complication in SCD, often requiring total hip arthroplasty (THA) when conservative treatments fail. While THA can improve pain and function, it carries significant perioperative risks, with complication rates in patients with SCD as high as 67 %. This study aims to compare postoperative outcomes, medical costs, and the impact of different THA implant designs in patients with SCD versus a matched non-SCD cohort. The study utilized the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) database. Postoperative outcomes in patients with and without SCD undergoing total hip arthroplasty between the fourth quarter of 2015 and 2020 were analyzed using propensity score matching and multivariable logistic regression modeling. Additionally, a subgroup analysis examined outcomes based on the use of cemented versus non-cemented implants. The study analyzed 2,830,040 hip arthroplasty patients, including 2535 with sickle cell disease (SCD), and after propensity score matching, found that patients with SCD had significantly higher rates of postoperative complications such as periprosthetic fractures, dislocations, infections, and acute kidney injury. Multivariate analysis confirmed SCD as an independent risk factor for these complications, along with increased hospital stays and higher charges. Additionally, patients with SCD receiving cemented implants experienced worse outcomes, including higher risks of periprosthetic fractures and infections, compared to those with non-cemented implants. This study found that patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) undergoing total hip arthroplasty had significantly higher complication rates, increased healthcare costs, and longer hospital stays, with cemented implants posing greater risks compared to press-fit implants."

Anaphylactic transfusion reactions are rarer, and seen in 1 per 10.000 transfusions, and are mostly related to platelet transfusions. Here, we describe a rare cause of a transfusion reaction. A 19-year-old man underwent an allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation for sickle cell disease and developed an anaphylactic shock following a platelet transfusion, after excluding all common causes. The patient reported a shrimp allergy, and one of the blood/platelet donors had consumed shrimp the day before donation. Elevated levels of specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) directed against shrimp and tropomyosin allergens were found in the patient. Subsequent transfusions were performed with apheresis platelets from selected donors who were instructed to avoid shrimp consumption, and these transfusions were uneventfully. When a severe transfusion reaction occurs in a patient with a known food allergy, an IgE-mediated (food-related) transfusion reaction should be considered after excluding other causes."

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is characterized by acute episodes called vaso-occlusive crises (VOC). VOC is marked by severe pain due to blocked blood vessels by sickled cells. Ketamine has been reported to be effective and safe in managing VOC in SCD patients. This review aims to determine ketamine's safety and efficacy through analysis of clinical trials and observational studies. Adhering to PRISMA guidelines, this systematic review and meta-analysis systematically searched seven databases on May 20, 2024 for randomized control trials (RCT), cohorts, and case-control studies. Five studies with 689 participants met the inclusion criteria. A meta-analysis of two studies (518 observations) for the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) pain score showed no significant difference, with a standardized mean difference (MD) of 0.23 (95% CI: -0.13 to 0.59, <i>p</i> = 0.21, <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0%). For morphine milligram equivalent (MME), a meta-analysis of two studies (344 observations) resulted in an MD of -0.03 (95% CI: -0.09 to 0.04, <i>p</i> = 0.45, <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 97%). However, the side effects analysis from four studies (608 observations) showed a significantly higher relative risk (RR) of 5.74 (95% CI: 2.80-11.79, <i>p</i> < 0.0001, <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0%) for mild side effects, including nausea, vomiting, and dizziness. Ketamine qualitative synthesis shows potential for improving pain management in SCD patients during VOC, but without statistically significant differences in pain reduction. It is associated with increased mild side effects, though no severe adverse events were reported. Further research is needed to increase the sample size and power of the analysis to clarify optimal dosing and administration protocols for ketamine in this context."

We used the ID-Pain (ID-P) questionnaire and a bedside clinical sensory testing (CST) as screening tools for NP and performed sensory nerve conduction study (SNCS) for all the participants. The impact of pain was assessed using Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) questionnaires and Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) SCD module. The mean age was 12.4 years. The ID-P questionnaire revealed that 20.5% of patients likely had NP, while 10 (34%) of the participants had abnormal CST, and only two patients (4.5%) had abnormal SNCS. On the PROMIS pain scores, the mean pain intensity score was 7.9 ± 2.0. Pain interference was the most affected domain in both patients and parent proxy reports (mean ± SD T-score 63.4 ± 6.6 and 65.2 ± 6.6, respectively) which was worse than other domains including pain quality-sensory and affective, and pain behavior (median T-scores of 47.8, 63.0, and 56.2, respectively). The mean global health-related quality of life (HRQoL) score of the children was 50.3 ± 12.1 indicating poor quality of life. We report the utility of simple tools like ID-P questionnaire and CST for screening of NP in young individuals with SCD."

    "abstract": "This retrospective study aimed to investigate the impact of the emergence of new variants and the epidemiological scenario on hospitalization rates of unvaccinated children (0-12 years) in Brazil. The study included 1614 children admitted to a hospital between March 2020 and December 2022 but 101 (6.3%) of them testing positive for COVID-19 via RT-PCR. The frequency of COVID-19 cases increased from 7.5% in 2020 to 9.3% in 2022 with the emergence of the Omicron variant. Children over 5 years old with comorbidities accounted for most cases (69% [70/101]). Sickle cell anemia was the most frequent comorbidity (20%), and influenza-like illness (36% [36/101]) and decompensation of underlying disease (33% [33/101]) were the main reasons for hospitalization. Coinfection was detected in 11% of cases, with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) being the most common viral pathogen (71%). Hospital readmission occurred in 26% of cases, with a higher frequency in children over 5 years old. The death rate was 1.9%, with comorbidities such as cystic fibrosis and congenital heart disease as risk factors. These findings emphasize the need to prioritize vaccination with monovalent Omicron XBB for high-risk groups, including children over 5 years old with comorbidities, to mitigate the impact of new variants and reduce severe disease outcomes."

However, impacts of SCD on HRQoL and the unmet needs of SCD treatment/management are under-researched. This study characterized the impact of SCD on HRQoL and identified the unmet needs of individuals with SCD. Adults with SCD (aged ≥ 18 years) and caregivers of adolescents (aged 12‒17) with SCD in the United States (US) and United Kingdom (UK) participated in one-on-one virtual semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions (hereafter referred to as 'interviews'). Interviews were transcribed and thematically analyzed. Nineteen individuals participated in the study (across five interviews and three focus group discussions), including 18 adults with SCD (United States, n = 11; United Kingdom, n = 7) and one caregiver of an adolescent with SCD (United States). Most participants were female (n = 15). Participants reported negative impacts of SCD on their HRQoL, including the burden of structuring their lives around SCD, due to unpredictable symptoms. They reported negative impacts to psychological health (e.g., depression/low mood and anxiety) and physical health (e.g., chronic pain and fatigue) that affected their social and family life, work, and education, leading to feelings of isolation. Participants expressed concerns about the future, feelings of resentment, and the need for high resilience when facing the barriers/impacts associated with SCD. Many participants reported negative interactions with healthcare professionals, leading to trauma, anxiety, and routine care avoidance. Most participants reported perceived prejudice during routine SCD treatment/management, including being treated as drug-seekers. Individuals with SCD experience negative HRQoL impacts, including impacts to daily activities, social and family life, work and education, psychological health, and prejudice/stigma. Our findings highlight significant unmet needs of individuals living with SCD, including alternative treatment options to reduce vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) frequency and treat fatigue."

We aimed to understand how frequent and intense treatment reactions, conceptualized as unwanted symptoms, were in three clinical trials of digital Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) for adolescents with: (1) chronic primary pain, (2) sickle cell disease, and (3) chronic pancreatitis. We also aimed to understand any differences by demographic and clinical variables. Analyses were conducted with 246 youths (12-18 years old) experiencing chronic pain and one of their caregivers. 66% of the total sample was female. The number, intensity, and type of treatment reactions experienced were assessed post treatment. T-tests and Chi-squared tests were conducted to explore whether certain treatment reactions were more frequent as a function of baseline or clinical characteristics. 9% of participants experienced some negative treatment reaction. The average intensity of those events was very low on a 0-3 scale (M = 0.1, SD = 0.4). There were no differences in the prevalence or intensity as a function of participant's sex, age, race, or baseline pain intensity. However, baseline anxiety [t = -2.4 (244); p < .05] and baseline pain interference [t = -2.2 (223); p < .05] were significantly higher in those who experienced negative treatment reactions. A small number of participants reported experiencing negative treatment reactions, with a low intensity level. Those experiencing negative treatment reactions showed higher baseline anxiety and pain interference. Future research may build from our example to standardize collection of harms data in trials of psychological interventions."

    "abstract": "Recently, cytosine base editors (CBEs) have emerged as a promising therapeutic tool for specific editing of single nucleotide variants and disrupting specific genes associated with disease. Despite this promise, the currently available CBEs have the significant liabilities of off-target and bystander editing activities, partly due to the mechanism by which they are delivered, causing limitations in their potential applications. In this study, we engineered optimized, soluble and stable Cas-embedded CBEs (CE_CBEs) that integrate several recent advances, which were efficiently formulated for direct delivery into cells as ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes. Our resulting CE_CBE RNP complexes efficiently target cytosines in TC dinucleotides with minimal off-target or bystander mutations. Delivery of additional uracil glycosylase inhibitor protein in trans further increased C-to-T editing efficiency and target purity in a dose-dependent manner, minimizing indel formation. A single electroporation was sufficient to effectively edit the therapeutically relevant locus BCL11A for sickle cell disease in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells in a dose-dependent manner without cellular toxicity. Significantly, these CE_CBE RNPs permitted highly efficient editing and engraftment of transplanted cells in mice. Thus, our designed CBE proteins provide promising reagents for RNP-based editing at disease-related sites."

Further, to see the correlation between copper and zinc levels with fetal hemoglobin level in sickle cell anemia (SCA) subjects in both stable state and during the crisis. Copper and zinc levels in serum of 100 SCA and 100 healthy subjects were measured using commercially available kits. The copper-to-zinc ratio was then obtained by dividing the copper and zinc levels. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used to determine the fetal hemoglobin level of every participant. The data were compared between SCA subjects in a stable state, crisis state, and control subjects using the Student's <i>t</i>-test, and the variables were linked with disease severity levels using the Pearson's correlation coefficient. The levels of copper and the ratio of copper-to-zinc were notably elevated in SCA patients compared to controls, whereas zinc levels were lower in the SCA patients. Zinc level was associated negatively (<i>r</i> = -0.350; <i>p</i> < 0.001), while the ratio of copper to zinc was associated positively (<i>r</i> = 0.246; <i>p</i> = 0.014) with objective disease severity scores. Copper levels were elevated, while zinc levels were reduced in sickle cell anemia patients, and the ratio of copper-zinc in these patients may predict the severity of the disease."

Dual targeting of the BCL11A +58 and +55 enhancers with 3xNLS-SpCas9 and two single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) resulted in superior HbF induction, including in sickle cell disease (SCD) patient xenografts, attributable to simultaneous disruption of core half E-box/GATA motifs at both enhancers. Unintended on-target outcomes of double-strand break (DSB) repair in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), such as long deletions and centromere-distal chromosome fragment loss, are a byproduct of cellular proliferation stimulated by ex vivo culture.

To examine patterns in how patients completed the BPI-SF and determine whether incorrectly completing the BPI-SF was related to cognitive functioning or education. A secondary analysis was completed using data from a study examining brain aging and cognitive impairment in SCD. T-tests were performed to examine whether neurocognitive function (immediate and delayed memory, visuospatial skills, attention, and language), word reading, and years of education differed based on correct BPI-SF completion. The sample (n = 71) was 43.7% male, 98.6% African American or mixed race. Of that, 53.5% had sickle cell anemia, and the mean years of education was 13.6. Overall, 21.1% of participants (n = 15) incorrectly completed the BPI-SF pain severity items, and 57.7% completed the body map item incorrectly. Those who completed the severity items incorrectly had statistically significant differences in education. Group differences in neurocognitive function were no longer significant after familywise error rates were controlled for. Literacy was not associated with error rates. Education level may influence patients' ability to correctly complete the BPI-SF. Findings suggest that careful consideration is warranted for use of the BPI in patients with SCD.

We performed a retrospective observational study on 124 patients with SSc-PH in which LV longitudinal strain was collected over a 16-segment model. We applied K-means clustering to LV longitudinal strain at each segment using the Calinski-Harabasz index. Our primary outcome was time to all-cause mortality. Patients with SSc-PH were divided into two clusters (Cluster 1: N = 59; Cluster 2: N = 65). The most pronounced differences in longitudinal strain between each cluster were observed at the basal and mid segments, particularly at the interventricular septum. In comparison to Cluster 1, Cluster 2 was characterized by both regional and global reductions in LV and right ventricular (RV) free wall longitudinal strain, greater PH severity, and greater functional limitation by New York Heart Association with a hazard ratio of 2.06 (95 % CI: 1.21, 3.50) for all-cause mortality. Using K-means clustering of regional patterns of LV longitudinal strain, we identified a distinct phenotype of patients at increased risk for mortality.

This document outlines the production of certified reference materials (CRMs) for HbA<sub>2</sub> and the development of a reference measurement procedure using isotope dilution mass spectrometry. Similarly, standardizing HbF is essential for supporting diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, particularly in managing sickle cell disease. HbF levels can predict disease outcomes and guide treatment plans. Significant challenges remain in achieving consistent measurement across laboratories, and the process for standardization for this minor hemoglobin has just begun.

Geographically, the United States and China lead in the number of CRISPR clinical trials, followed by the European Union. However, Africa, Asia, and South America have very few trials. Among disease classes, cancer is the most prevalent focus with 39 studies, followed by monogenetic blood diseases, like Thalassemia and sickle cell anaemia. The biological agent CTX001 and Cyclophosphamide each feature in 11 studies. The peak year for clinical trials was 2018, marked by a significant increase with 16 studies conducted. Despite conducting a comprehensive search, the majority of trials were concentrated in the United States and China. Additionally, potential oversights due to vague titles, English-only studies, and indexing issues may have occurred. Nonetheless, by incorporating data from seven distinct databases, this review significantly contributes to understanding CRISPR's utilization in therapeutic clinical trials, paving the way for future research directions. The review underscores the burgeoning interest in CRISPR-based interventions. Current trials barely tap CRISPR's potential for treating genetic diseases."

    "title": "Relationships Between Markers of Iron Status and Hematological Parameters in Patients With Sickle Cell Disease.",
    "abstract": "Based on the relationship between the intracellular concentration of sickle hemoglobin S (HbS) and the delay that occurs prior to the onset of sickling following deoxygenation, targeting the intracellular HbS concentration is a recognized therapeutic approach for sickle cell disease (SCD). We and others have shown that restricting iron by dietary or pharmacologic means improves hematologic parameters, inflammation, and organ damage in mouse models of SCD. Clinical evidence corroborating these findings is confined to case reports and small case series studies, none of which account for treatment or <i>α</i>-thalassemia. We hypothesize that increased transferrin saturation is associated with increased mean cellular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) which in turn is associated with decreased red cell counts and worsening anemia. To investigate this hypothesis, we examined the relationships between transferrin saturation and MCHC with each of the parameters that define MCHC in sickle patients (HbSS without <i>α</i>-thalassemia) and healthy volunteers (HVs). Results indicate that transferrin saturation and MCHC are positively correlated with each other in sickle patients and HV. In patients with SCD, MCHC and transferrin saturation are negatively correlated with RBC count and are not correlated with hemoglobin, whereas each is positively associated with HV. Transferrin saturation and MCHC are each positively correlated with the hemolysis marker, lactate dehydrogenase. These observations support a model where increased transferrin saturation contributes to higher intracellular HbS concentrations with subsequent increases in sickling and hemolysis in sickle patients, suggesting that pharmacologic approaches to decrease serum iron may provide a therapeutic approach for patients with SCD. <b>Trial Registration:</b> This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers: NCT00011648, NCT00081523, and NCT04817670."

    "abstract": "Hospitalized patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) may use opioid medications for both acute and chronic pain management. Use of these medications may unintentionally generate diagnostic codes for opioid misuse including \"opioid use,\" \"opioid abuse,\" and \"opioid dependence,\" which connote a behavioral problem or addiction. In this study, we sought to compare diagnostic codes for opioid misuse amongst hospitalized patients with and without SCD. We performed a cross-sectional study of hospitalized non-obstetric, non-surgical, and non-elective patients with SCD using the National Inpatient Sample published by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Hospital Cost Utilization Project during years 2016-2019. We used descriptive statistics to characterize patient demographics and opioid misuse diagnostic codes. We used Chi Square testing to compare rates of diagnostic codes for opioid misuse between patients with and without SCD. There were 165 ± 3 hospitalizations for SCD per 100,000 US population. Patients with SCD had higher rates of opioid misuse diagnostic codes for \"opioid use\" (0.3% vs 0.1%, <i>p</i> < 0.001) and \"opioid dependence\" (4.5% vs 1.6%, <i>p</i> < 0.001), but a lower rate for \"opioid abuse\" (0.2% vs 0.3%, <i>p</i> < 0.001). We found that diagnostic codes for opioid misuse are higher in those with SCD than without SCD, even at young ages, which impart substantial bias toward these patients."

    "abstract": "The spleen is prone to both physical damage and functional impairment, which can be difficult to detect before catastrophic complications occur. Currently available tests of splenic function are laborious, user-dependent and unreliable, so there is an unmet need for a reliable test offered routinely in diagnostic laboratories. In this study, we have assessed a simple flow cytometry-based method measuring high mannose glycans (HMGs) on erythrocytes, which has previously been proposed as a potential test of splenic function. We developed the test as a diagnostic assay using blood from a range of control and potentially hyposplenic samples, including people with sickle cell disease. HMG expression correlated well with manual pit counting, an established method for assessing splenic function (r = 0.6). A threshold of >36% difference compared to the mean of control samples was used to define hyposplenism. At this threshold, the test is 93% sensitive and 100% specific for detecting splenic dysfunction. The test was highly reproducible and stable in blood samples of up to 4 days old. This test is non-invasive with quantitative data output and requires significantly less operator time than other available techniques, making it a robust new clinical assay for determining splenic function."

    "title": "The role of miR-129-5p in regulating γ-globin expression and erythropoiesis in β-thalassemia.",
    "abstract": "The regulation of γ-globin expression is crucial due to its beneficial effects on diseases like β-thalassemia and sickle cell disease. B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 11A (BCL11A) is a significant suppressor of γ-globin, and microRNAs (miRNAs) targeting BCL11A have been shown to alleviate this suppression. In our previous high-throughput sequencing, we identified an 11.32-fold increase in miR-129-5p expression in β-thalassemia patients. However, the regulatory mechanisms of miR-129-5p in the context of erythroid differentiation remain to be elucidated. Our study aimed to elucidate the role of miR-129-5p in γ-globin regulation and erythropoiesis. We measured miR-129-5p levels in peripheral blood from β-thalassemia major and intermedia patients. Fluorescence in situ hybridization, dual-luciferase reporter assays, miRNA pull down assays and western blot analyses were conducted to examine the effects of miR-129-5p on γ-globin expression and BCL11A repression. Cell proliferation, apoptosis, and erythroid differentiation were assessed using cell counting kit-8, Wright-Giemsa, and benzidine staining, and flow cytometry assays. The expression levels of miR-129-5p were significantly elevated in β-thalassemia patients and positively correlated with γ-globin synthesis while negatively correlating with liver damage. miR-129- 5p enhanced γ-globin gene expression in K562 and HUDEP-2 cells by effectively repressing BCL11A. Overexpression of miR-129-5p inhibited cell proliferation, induced cell cycle arrest at the G1/G0 phase, promoted apoptosis and stimulated erythroid differentiation and maturation. Conversely, inhibition of miR-129-5p produced opposite cellular effects. miR-129-5p acts as a positive regulator of erythroid differentiation and γ-globin synthesis. It offers a promising miRNA target for activating the γ-globin gene and reducing ineffective erythropoiesis in β-thalassemia patients."

    "abstract": "The pathophysiology of sickle cell disease (SCD) is characterized by hemolytic anemia and vaso-occlusion, although its impact on the adaptive immune responses remains incompletely understood. To comprehensibly profile the humoral immune responses, we immunized SCD mice with T-cell-independent (TI) and T-cell-dependent (TD) antigens (Ags). Our study showed that SCD mice have significantly enhanced type 2 TI (TI-2) immune responses in a manner dependent on the level of type I interferons (IFN-I), while maintaining similar or decreased TD immune responses depending on the route of Ag administration. Consistent with the enhanced TI-2 immune responses in SCD mice, the frequencies of B-1b cells (B-1 cells in humans), a major cell type responding to TI-2 Ags, were significantly increased in both the peritoneal cavity and spleens of SCD mice and in the blood of patients with SCD. In support of expanded B-1 cells, elevated levels of anti-red blood cell (anti-RBC) autoantibodies were detected in both SCD mice and patients. Both the levels of TI-2 immune responses and anti-RBC autoantibodies were significantly reduced after IFN-I receptor (IFNAR) antibody blockades and in IFNAR1-deficient SCD mice. Moreover, the alterations of B-1 cell subsets were reversed in IFNAR1-deficient SCD mice, uncovering a critical role for IFN-I in the enhanced TI-2 immune responses and the increased production of anti-RBC autoantibodies by modulating the innate B-1 cell subsets in SCD. Overall, our study provides experimental evidence that the modulation of B-1 cells and IFN-I can regulate TI immune responses and the levels of anti-RBC autoantibodies in SCD."

    "abstract": "Administration of pneumococcal vaccines and oral penicillin prophylaxis has been recommended for children with sickle cell disease (SCD) to reduce the risk of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD). Characterizing changes in IPD cases among children with SCD after 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) introduction could help inform the need for additional prevention measures. Using data from Active Bacterial Core surveillance, we characterized IPD cases among Black or African American (Black) children aged less than 18 years with SCD, non-SCD IPD risk factors, and no IPD risk factors across three time periods (pre-PCV13 [2005-2009], early-PCV13 [2010-2014], and late-PCV13 [2015-2019]), and assessed proportion of IPD cases caused by serotypes in new pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV15, PCV20) recommended after 2019. We analyzed IPD incidence among children with and without SCD. From 2005 to 2019, 1725 IPD cases were reported among Black children (6.9% with SCD). IPD incidence among children with SCD declined by 50% between pre-PCV13 and late-PCV13 periods (from 332 to 167 per 100,000), although IPD incidence among children with SCD was 42 times that of children without SCD in late-PCV13 period. During late-PCV13 period, greater than 95% of IPD cases among children with SCD were non-PCV13 serotypes; PCV15/non-PCV13 and PCV20/non-PCV15 serotypes caused 19% and 22% of cases, respectively. Increase in penicillin-nonsusceptible IPD cases was not observed. Despite reductions in IPD incidence after PCV13 introduction, children with SCD are at increased risk of IPD compared to children without SCD. Use of higher valency PCVs may help reduce remaining IPD burden."

    "abstract": "Social determinants of health (SDoH) are socioeconomic factors that influence health and well-being, though when unmet can greatly contribute to health disparities. Individuals with sickle cell disease (SCD) are at increased risk of mortality, disability, and healthcare utilization. However, there are limited data linking specific social needs with disease outcomes in this population. Therefore, we sought to identify the unmet needs in one institution and their association with healthcare utilization. Children with SCD and their guardians answered demographic and SDoH questionnaires during routine Sickle Cell Clinic appointments. We defined an unmet social need as any positive answer to the SDoH questionnaire. Disease outcome variables were electronic health record (EHR)-documented emergency department (ED) visits, hospitalizations, clinic appointment attendance, and guardian-reported acute SCD events in the previous year. A total of 114 parent-guardian dyads participated, with 103 having complete data to analyze. In all, 52% of subjects reported at least one unmet social need with food insecurity (36%), trouble paying utility bills (28%), and unemployment (16%) being the most prevalent. Subjects with at least one unmet need had two times the rate of ED visits and/or hospitalizations and were 1.15 times more likely to have an SCD event in the past year. However, only the association with ED visits was statistically significant (p = 0.03). Over half of subjects reported at least one unmet need; the most common being reliable access to food, which has the potential to impact health outcomes of sickle cell patients. Furthermore, unmet social needs are linked to healthcare utilization and SCD-related complications, supporting routine screening for SDoH in this population."

    "abstract": "Despite the fact that perceptions of racialized discrimination, health-related stigma, and pain-related injustice have been associated with worse patient functioning, little is known about their unique relationships in Black youth living with sickle cell disease (SCD). In this study, we (1) examined the prevalence of perceptions of racialized discrimination, perceptions of health-related stigma, and pain-related injustice appraisals and (2) investigated how the aforementioned variables were uniquely related to functioning (i.e., functional disability, depressive, and anxiety symptoms) in Black youth living with SCD. The study sample included 30 non-Hispanic Black or African American youth living with SCD (17 male, 13 female youths). The average age of the sample was approximately 11.3 years (SD = 2.73). Zero-order correlations and hierarchical regressions were used to examine and compare the multivariate relationships between perceived racialized discrimination, perceived health-related stigma, and perceived pain-related injustice and outcome variables (functional disability, anxiety symptoms, and depressive symptoms). For functional disability, perceived racialized discrimination and perceived pain-related injustice were significant predictors in the final model (F(3,26) = 11.00, p < .01). For depressive symptoms, health-related stigma trended toward significance (p = .09) as a predictor in the final model (F(2,26) = 6.69, p < .01). For anxiety symptoms, perceived pain-related injustice was the only significant predictor in the final model (F(3,26) = 10.25, p < .001). Results suggest that the youth living with SCD experience and perceive racialized discrimination, health-related stigma, and injustice surrounding their pain experience and these factors are associated with worse outcomes."

    "title": "The Prevalence of Sickle Cell Disease in Colorado and Methodologies of the Colorado Sickle Cell Data Collection Program: Public Health Surveillance Study.",
    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic blood disorder that affects approximately 100,000 individuals in the United States, with the highest prevalence among Black or African American populations. While advances in care have improved survival, comprehensive state-level data on the prevalence of SCD remain limited, which hampers efforts to optimize health care services. To address this gap, the Colorado Sickle Cell Data Collection (CO-SCDC) program was established in 2021 as part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's initiative to enhance surveillance and public health efforts for SCD. The objectives of this study were to describe the establishment of the CO-SCDC program and to provide updated estimates of the prevalence and birth prevalence of SCD in Colorado, including geographic dispersion. Additional objectives include evaluating the accuracy of case identification methods and leveraging surveillance activities to inform public health initiatives. Data were collected from Health Data Compass (a multi-institutional data warehouse) containing electronic health records from the University of Colorado Health and Children's Hospital Colorado for the years 2012-2020. Colorado newborn screening program data were included for confirmed SCD diagnoses from 2001 to 2020. Records were linked using the Colorado University Record Linkage tool and deidentified for analysis. Case definitions, adapted from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Registry and Surveillance System for Hemoglobinopathies project, classified cases as possible, probable, or definite SCD. Clinical validation by hematologists was performed to ensure accuracy, and prevalence rates were calculated using 2020 US Census population estimates. In 2019, 435 individuals were identified as living with SCD in Colorado, an increase of 16%-40% over previous estimates, with the majority (n=349, 80.2%) identifying as Black or African American. The median age of individuals was 19 years. The prevalence of SCD was highest in urban counties, with concentrations in Arapahoe, Denver, and El Paso counties. Birth prevalence of SCD increased from 11.9 per 100,000 live births between 2010 and 2014 to 20.1 per 100,000 live births between 2015 and 2019 with 58.5% (n=38) of cases being hemoglobin (Hb) SS or HbSβ0 thalassemia subtypes. The study highlighted a 67% (n=26) increase in SCD births over the decade, correlating with the growth of the Black or African American population in the state. The CO-SCDC program successfully established the capacity to perform SCD surveillance and, in doing so, identified baseline prevalence estimates for SCD in Colorado. The findings highlight geographic dispersion across Colorado counties, highlighting the need for equitable access to specialty care, particularly for rural populations. The combination of automated data linkage and clinical validation improved case identification accuracy. Future efforts will expand surveillance to include claims data to better capture health care use and address potential underreporting. These results will guide public health interventions aimed at improving care for individuals with SCD in Colorado."

Patients were identified from the Danish National Patient Registry covering all Danish hospitals and the National Reference Laboratory for RBC disorders during 1980-2016. Patients were matched by sex, age, and region of origin with up to 50 general population comparators. Gallstone events were identified using hospital-registered diagnoses and surgery codes. Our study included 9354 congenital RBC disorder patients, grouped according to type of congenital RBC disorder, and 416 994 general population comparators. The cumulative 10-year incidence of gallstone disease was 4.2% in patients with congenital RBC disorders and 1.7% among comparators.

This study aims to compare HbA1c levels in transfusion-dependent thalassemia (TDT) patients and healthy individuals. Materials and methods This is a cross-sectional comparative study. This study comprises two population groups. The first group includes 35 TDT patients and the second group consists of 35 non-thalassemic individuals who were matched for age (±1 year), gender, and BMI (±1 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). The patients were selected from the pediatric outpatient department (OPD), thalassemia ward in the pediatric department, and medicine OPD. Written informed consent/assent was obtained from the participants. A 3 ml fasting venous blood sample for fasting blood sugar (FBS), HbA1c, and complete blood count (CBC) values was obtained in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) vials on the scheduled blood transfusion day (pretransfusion samples). Samples were then sent to an in-house accredited lab for testing and analysis. HbA1c was performed using the high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) technique. Data was compared using a t-test. Qualitative parameters were compared between groups by X<sup>2</sup> square analyses. A multivariate linear regression model was used to explore the independent contribution of an individual predictor to HbA1c variability. Results In the study, 85.7% of patients with TDT had HbA1c levels in the diabetic range (>6.4%). In comparison, none of the control group patients had HbA1c values in the diabetic range. The mean HbA1c level was 6.94% in TDT cases and 5.3% in the control group, which was statistically significant (p < 0.001). Elevated FBS levels in the prediabetic range (>100 mg/dl, <126mg/dl) were observed in 25.7% TDT cases. All 35 controls had normal FBS levels (<100 mg/dl). No significant difference was found in FBS levels between cases (92.97 (±9.141) mg/dL) and controls (89.20 (±7.584) mg/dL) (p = 0.065). However moderately positive correlation exists between FBS and HbA1C (r =.470, p = 0.004) and between age and HbA1C (r = 0.335, p = 0.049). Conclusions The use of HbA1c as a screening tool for diabetes mellitus (DM) or assessment of glycemic control is inappropriate in TDT patients. The levels could be falsely elevated, as we found out in our study. In conditions where there is a mismatch between HbA1c and FBS levels, as seen in TDT patients, plasma glucose criteria should be used to diagnose diabetes. It is advised to use alternative indices such as fructosamine levels, glycated albumin, and continuous glucose monitoring."

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) disrupts oxygen transport due to the abnormal shape and rigidity of red blood cells, leading to hemolysis. Hemolysis, a major co-morbidity in SCD, is indicated by elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Arginine depletion, which is essential for nitric oxide (NO) synthesis, contributes to various complications in SCD. L-arginine supplementation may increase NO levels and reduce oxidative stress. Research on its benefits in SCD, which is prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa, is limited. This study evaluates the effect of arginine supplementation on LDH levels in patients with steady state SCD. In a retrospective study, we evaluated the effect of arginine supplementation on LDH levels in a cohort of 31 patients. We divided the study into three phases: pre-HU treatment, HU treatment, and combined HU and arginine supplementation. The cohort had a median age of 12 years, ranging from 2 to 43 years. Throughout all three phases of the study, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels were consistently above the established normal ranges, with elevations of 216.7%, 220.3% and 176.6% above the normative values for baseline, Phase 1 (HU) and Phase 2 (HU + Arg), respectively. Specifically, LDH levels were 649.7 ± 364.2 U/L in Baseline Phase, 661.6 ± 367 U/L in Phase 1, and 529.9 ± 346.3 U/L in Phase 2. When comparing these discrete study intervals, it is noteworthy that LDH levels were significantly lower in Phase 2 compared to the previous phases (<i>p</i> = 0.002). Preliminary findings revealed a significant lower LDH levels among sickle cell patients receiving combined arginine supplementation and hydroxyurea (HU). Although these findings are promising, their credibility and applicability require further and more extensive research."

By including outpatient visits alongside inpatient and emergency department (ED) visits, the study offers a comprehensive view of postpartum health care needs among women with SMM. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> This retrospective cohort study used data from Optum's de-identified Clinformatics® Data Mart Database from 2008 to 2019. The primary outcomes were early and late postpartum inpatient readmissions, early and late ED visits, and outpatient care within 42 days after delivery. Multilevel logistic regression models were used to estimate the association between SMM subtypes and postpartum readmission, ED, and outpatient care. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Except for hemorrhage, most SMM subtypes increased the postpartum odds of health care utilization. Women with other medical SMM (e.g., puerperal cerebrovascular disorders or sickle cell disease with crisis) had 2.9 times the odds (odds ratio [OR]: 2.87, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.30-6.34) of experiencing early readmissions compared with those without other medical SMM. Women with sepsis had 4.5-fold elevated odds (OR: 4.53, 95% CI: 2.48-8.28) of late readmission, a 1.9-fold increased odds (OR: 1.85, 95% CI: 1.12-3.04) of early ED visits, and over a 2-fold increased odds (OR: 2.27, 95% CI: 1.67-3.08) of postpartum outpatient visits compared with those without sepsis. <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> This study reveals that certain SMM subtypes significantly increase postpartum health care utilization, emphasizing the need for further research and interventions to improve outcomes for affected women."

Prospective Identification of Variables as Outcomes for Treatment (PIVOT) was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, non-inferiority phase 2 trial in which we assigned children and adults with HbSC in Ghana to 12 months of hydroxyurea or placebo. The primary end point was hematologic dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), including cytopenias or elevated hemoglobin levels during 12 months of blinded treatment. Clinical end points included vaso-occlusive pain events, acute chest syndrome, hospitalizations, transfusions, and malaria. Quality-of-life measures, organ function assessments, and rheological measurements were also collected. Of the 243 enrolled patients (118 female), 212 eligible participants initiated blinded treatment at 20.0±5.0 mg/kg/day. DLTs occurred in more participants on hydroxyurea (33%) than the placebo (11%), with a difference of 22 percentage points (95% confidence interval [CI],11 to 34 percentage points), which exceeded the predefined 15 percentage point noninferiority margin. Elevated levels of hemoglobin occurred in 12 participants on hydroxyurea and 10 on the placebo. Hydroxyurea treatment was associated with 57.0 versus 149.6 vaso-occlusive pain events per 100 person-years (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 0.38; 95% CI, 0.28 to 0.52), and 12.9 versus 30.6 hospitalizations per 100 person-years (IRR 0.42; 95% CI, 0.22 to 0.81). A composite of acute sickle-related events occurred in 37 participants on hydroxyurea versus 69 participants on placebo (IRR 0.39; (95% CI, 0.26 to 0.59), a difference observed in both children and adults. The PIVOT trial did not meet its primary end point. Hydroxyurea at 20 mg/kg in patients with HbSC was associated with more hematologic DLTs than placebo, but most were mild and transient. Hydroxyurea was associated with less vaso-occlusive pain and fewer sickle-related events in both children and adults; a new trial will need to be done to establish the efficacy of this approach.

    "title": "Safety and efficacy of mitapivat in sickle cell disease (RISE UP): results from the phase 2 portion of a global, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial.",
    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease, a debilitating, inherited haemolytic anaemia with premature morbidity and mortality, affects millions globally. Mitapivat, a first-in-class, oral, allosteric activator of pyruvate kinase, improves red blood cell survival by increasing ATP and diminishes sickling by decreasing 2,3-diphosphoglycerate. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of mitapivat in patients with sickle cell disease. We report results from the phase 2, 12-week, double-blind period of RISE UP, a global, phase 2/3, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial. The phase 2 part of the study was conducted at 32 clinical study sites across 13 countries. Patients aged 16 years or older with a confirmed diagnosis of sickle cell disease (any genotype), baseline haemoglobin of 5·5-10·5 g/dL (inclusive), and two to ten sickle cell pain crises within 12 months before providing informed consent, were randomly assigned 1:1:1 to receive oral mitapivat 50 mg, 100 mg, or placebo twice daily, in this portion of the study which is now complete. Randomisation was performed using a permuted-block method and concealed with an interactive response system; patients, investigators, and individuals assessing outcomes were masked to treatment assignment. Primary efficacy and safety endpoints were haemoglobin response (≥1·0 g/dL increase from baseline in average haemoglobin concentration from week 10 through week 12), and type, severity, and relationship to study drug of adverse and serious adverse events. Efficacy and safety endpoints were evaluated in the full analysis set (all randomly assigned patients) and safety analysis set (all patients who received at least one dose of study drug), respectively. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov as part of an ongoing phase 2/3 study (NCT05031780). Between Jan 19, 2022, and April 25, 2023, 79 patients were randomly assigned (51 [65%] female, 28 [35%] male; 46 [58%] Black or African American, 26 [33%] White, five [6%] multiracial, two [3%] Asian); 26 received mitapivat 50 mg, 26 received mitapivat 100 mg, and 27 received placebo, twice daily. Both treatment groups showed a statistically significant haemoglobin response rate versus placebo (12 [46%] of 26 patients in the mitapivat 50 mg group and 13 [50%] of 26 patients in the mitapivat 100 mg group, versus one [4%] of 27 patients in the placebo group; two-sided p=0·0003 and p=0·0001, respectively). Mitapivat was generally well tolerated. Serious adverse events were reported in two (8%) of 26 patients in the mitapivat 50 mg group, four (15%) of 26 patients in the mitapivat 100 mg group, and three (11%) of 27 patients in the placebo group; grade 3 or worse adverse events occurred in three (12%), five (19%), and two (7%) patients, respectively. No serious or grade 3 or worse adverse events were considered treatment related and there were no treatment-related deaths. The most common grade 3 or worse adverse events were infections and infestations, and included one patient in the placebo group with an infected skin ulcer, one patient in the mitapivat 50 mg group with meningitis and one with pelvic inflammatory disease, and one patient each with malaria, pneumonia, and tonsillitis in the mitapivat 100 mg group. Mitapivat, through its dual effect of increasing ATP and decreasing 2,3-diphosphoglycerate, could provide clinical benefit to patients with sickle cell disease. These results support continued evaluation of mitapivat in the phase 3 portion of the study. Agios Pharmaceuticals."

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a significant public health concern in sub-Saharan Africa, where it is the most prevalent genetic disorder, presenting numerous health care and sociocultural challenges. A case study of a young girl from Ghana's Ashanti region illustrates the stigma surrounding SCD, driven by traditional beliefs and misconceptions that perceive SCD as a spiritual affliction. This stigma results in social ostracism and discrimination, impacting affected individuals and their families. Despite the severe and unpredictable pain associated with SCD, effective management is often hampered by limited health care resources and infrastructure. In Ghana and other African countries, inadequate pain relief and a lack of specialized care worsen the suffering of people with SCD. Health care providers' responses vary from empathy to dismissal, reflecting broader systemic issues in care delivery. Stigma has extensive effects, including social exclusion, psychological distress, and educational setbacks. The case study underscores the vital role of community education and support networks, such as those provided by the Sickle Cell Foundation of Ghana and Sickle Cell Association of Ghana, in reducing humiliation and enhancing the lives of those affected by SCD. Addressing the complex challenges of SCD in Africa requires comprehensive strategies. Improving the health care infrastructure, promoting community education, and establishing robust support systems are crucial to alleviating the burden of SCD, with the involvement of both government and nongovernmental organizations. These measures help create a more inclusive and understanding environment for individuals living with this chronic condition, enhancing their quality of life and overall well-being."

The thrombogenicity of combined hormonal contraceptives (CHCs) is due at least in part to multiple changes in clotting factors and the vasculature and is dependent on both estrogen dose and type of progestin. Transdermal patch and vaginal ring users have similar or higher VTE risk as combined oral contraceptive users. Progestin-only agents have varying VTE risk. While depot medroxyprogesterone acetate appears to increase VTE risk, the levonorgestrel-based intrauterine system and low-dose progestin-only pills have no additional VTE risk. There are less data for the subdermal progestin-only implant. This article reviews contraceptive-related VTE risk by agent and by clinical scenario, including in patients with inherited thrombophilia, systemic lupus erythematosus with or without antiphospholipid antibodies or antiphospholipid syndrome, and sickle cell disease.

The proposal also discusses the role of personalized medicine and technological advances, highlighting the need for a shared medical record; the balance between rare center expertise and widespread dissemination of knowledge; and the challenges in high- and low-income countries. It emphasizes the need to move toward personalized medicine, given the significant interindividual variability in both follow-up and treatment, and the introduction of more appropriate biomarkers and predictive algorithms to aid decision-making. The proposal includes real-world examples of successful adaptation in clinical care models. It concludes with a summary of the importance and benefits of evolving clinical care models and a future outlook on the evolution of clinical care in response to demographic changes.

However, barriers to high-quality EOL care remain, including (1) disease-related barriers (prior opioid exposure, risk of vaso-occlusive crises, chronic conditions with conflicting needs, and limitations of receiving disease-directed therapy on hospice); (2) communication-related barriers (challenges of identifying and responding to religious and spiritual concerns, limited health literacy, and previous health care system experience); (3) systemic issues (social determinants of health, structural racism, and mistrust of the medical system). However, palliative care and interdisciplinary collaboration can overcome many of these barriers. In addition, we can improve EOL care by accounting for opioid exposures, multimodal symptom management, and exploring (1) who people want involved in decision-making, (2) the role of religion and spirituality in decision-making, and (3) previous experiences with EOL. Systemic barriers can be addressed through the social determinants of health screening, minimizing financial burdens of care, and building longitudinal relationships with people with SCD. This requires the continued education of SCD providers about primary palliative care and palliative care providers about SCD. With such strategies, high-quality EOL care is possible for this vulnerable population."

    "abstract": "Hydroxyurea has historically been the sole disease-modifying medication (DMM) for sickle cell disease (SCD). However, 3 newer DMMs, L-glutamine, voxelotor, and crizanlizumab, were approved for children and adolescents with SCD since 2017. Despite their emergence, treatment barriers, including access, affordability, and nonadherence, limit the optimization of DMMs in the clinical setting. Furthermore, there is limited work outlining real-world use and safety of the newer DMMs, and no published guidelines advise how best to select between DMMs or to use multiple in combination. Meanwhile, each DMM is associated with unique characteristics, such as tolerability, cost, and route of administration, which must be considered when weighing these options with patients and families. This article discusses DMMs for SCD and offers practical guidance on using the available DMMs in real-world settings based on published peer-reviewed studies and considering patient preferences. The recent withdrawal of one of these DMMs (voxelotor) from the market highlights the need for additional DMMs and evidence-based practices for adding DMMs and when to progress towards curative therapies."

Historically, opioids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been the cornerstone of treatment for acute SCD pain. However, given the evolving understanding of the complexity of pain pathways in SCD and the desire to avoid NSAID and opioid-induced side effects, a multimodal approach is needed to effectively treat acute SCD pain. In this article we review recent research supporting the utilization of nonopioid pharmacologic interventions and nonpharmacologic interventions while also describing the research questions that remain surrounding their use and efficacy and effectiveness in the management of acute SCD pain. Furthermore, we review care delivery processes shown to improve acute SCD pain outcomes and highlight areas where more work is needed. Through this comprehensive approach, alternative mechanistic pathways may be addressed, leading to improved SCD pain outcomes."

The Arab Indian HbS haplotype in India is characterized by a relatively high percentage of fetal Hb, with widely varying frequencies of α-thalassemia. Hence, sickle cell disease (SCD) in India was perceived to be mild. Advances in the past decade in screening and SCD management have revealed that the severity of SCD in India is comparable to many other parts of the world. Clinical features in India include vaso-occlusive crisis, acute chest syndrome, avascular necrosis, renal involvement, stroke, etc, at a relatively young age. Once a fatal disease of childhood, the majority of patients born with SCD are expected to survive into adulthood, largely because of improvements in comprehensive care programs including newborn screening, penicillin prophylaxis, transcranial Doppler, and hydroxyurea therapy. Several centers are performing hematopoietic stem cell transplants successfully for SCD. To address the urgent need to control and manage SCD in India's population, the Government of India launched the National Sickle Cell Anaemia Elimination Mission, with significant funding for large-scale measures to screen, treat, counsel, educate, and develop technologies and novel therapies and gene therapies."

    "abstract": "The mortality burden of sickle cell anemia (SCA) is centered in sub-Saharan Africa. In addition to a lack of systematic programs for early diagnosis, access to disease-modifying treatments is limited to only a few urban centers. Providing a safe and adequate blood supply is a major challenge, heightening mortality from SCA-associated complications that require urgent blood transfusion and making the delivery of regular transfusion therapy for stroke prevention nonfeasible. Hydroxyurea therapy with proven clinical benefits for pain episodes, acute chest syndrome, malaria, transfusions, hospitalizations, and stroke prevention is the most feasible treatment for SCA in Africa. Access barriers to hydroxyurea treatment include poor availability, unaffordable costs, health professionals' reluctance to prescribe, a lack of national guidelines, and exaggerated fears about drug toxicities. Strategies for the local manufacture of hydroxyurea combined with the systematic education and training of health professionals using guidelines supported by the World Health Organization can help surmount the access barriers. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation as a curative therapy is available in only 7 countries in Africa. The few patients who have suitable sibling donors and can afford a transplant must usually travel out of the country for treatment, returning to their home countries where expertise and resources for posttransplant follow-up are lacking. The recently developed ex-vivo gene therapies are heavily dependent on technical infrastructure to deliver, a daunting challenge for Africa. Future in-vivo gene therapies that bypass myeloablation and ex-vivo processing would be more suitable. However, enthusiasm for pursuing these gene therapies should not overlook strategies to make hydroxyurea universally accessible in Africa."

To address variations in fetal hemoglobin (HbF) response, we investigated editing both +58 and +55 enhancers. Rhesus macaques transplanted with edited hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) following busulfan conditioning exhibited durable, high-level (∼90%) editing frequencies post transplantation with sustained HbF reactivation over 4 years, without hematological perturbations. HbF levels were further boosted by stress erythropoiesis or hydroxyurea. Bone marrow analysis revealed that gene edits were predominantly programmed deletions, programmed inversions, and short indels, each disrupting the enhancer core TGN<sub>7-9</sub>WGATAR half E-box/GATA binding motifs. Nonprogrammed long deletions were disfavored in engrafting cells. CD45 antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) conditioning achieved comparable engraftment and HbF reactivation, whereas lentiviral vector tracking showed polyclonal reconstitution with dynamics similar to animals conditioned with total body irradiation (TBI) or busulfan. Joining CD45-ADC conditioning with combined enhancer editing presents an effective strategy for β-hemoglobinopathies, enabling durable HbF reactivation without chemotherapy."

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic condition characterized by an abundance of sickle hemoglobin in red blood cells. SCD patients are more prone to intracranial aneurysms (ICA) compared to the general population, with distinctive features such as multiple intracranial aneurysms: 66% of SCD patients with ICAs have multiples ICAs, compared to 20% in nonsickle patients. The exact mechanism behind these associations is not fully understood, but there is a hypothesized link between hypoxic conditions in blood vessels and impaired synthesis of extracellular matrix, which may weaken the vessel walls, favoring aneurysm formation and rupture. SCD patients experience reduced oxygen levels in their blood, potentially exacerbating hypoxia in intracranial aneurysms, and potentially creating a feedback loop that could contribute to aneurysm development and early onset in these patients. In this work, we performed a series of computational studies (Fluent) using idealized geometries to investigate the key differences in the oxygen transport and blood flow dynamics inside an aneurysm formation for sickle and nonsickle cases. We found that using sickle cell disease parameters resulted in a 14% to 68% reduction in blood flow and a 37% to 70% reduction in oxygen availability within the aneurysm, depending on the vessel curvature and the aneurysm throat diameter, due to factors including oxygen-dependent viscosity and alteration in the oxygen transport. The results indicate that depending on geometry and flow characteristics, some degree of hypoxia maybe present in aneurysm bulb and would be more severe in sickle-cell disease patients. This study hopes to bring into attention the potential presence of hypoxic environment in the aneurysm bulb."

    "abstract": "Severe malaria is associated with impaired nitric oxide (NO) synthase (NOS)-dependent vasodilation, and reversal of this deficit improves survival in murine models. Malaria might have selected for genetic polymorphisms that increase endothelial NO signaling and now contribute to heterogeneity in vascular function among humans. One protein potentially selected for is alpha globin, which, in mouse models, interacts with endothelial NOS (eNOS) to negatively regulate NO signaling. We sought to evaluate the impact of alpha globin gene deletions on NO signaling and unexpectedly found human arteries use not only alpha but also beta globin to regulate eNOS. The eNOS-hemoglobin complex was characterized by multiphoton imaging, gene expression analysis, and coimmunoprecipitation studies of human resistance arteries. Novel contacts between eNOS and hemoglobin were mapped using molecular modeling and simulation. Pharmacological or genetic disruption of the eNOS-hemoglobin complex was evaluated using pressure myography. The association between alpha globin gene deletion and blood pressure was assessed in a population study. Alpha and beta globin transcripts were detected in the endothelial layer of the artery wall. Imaging colocalized alpha and beta globin proteins with eNOS at myoendothelial junctions. Immunoprecipitation demonstrated that alpha globin and beta globin form a complex with eNOS and cytochrome b5 reductase. Modeling predicted negatively charged glutamic acids at positions 6 and 7 of beta globin to interact with positively charged arginines at positions 97 and 98 of eNOS. Arteries from donors with a glutamic acid-to-valine substitution at beta globin position 6 (sickle trait) exhibited increased NOS-dependent vasodilation. Alpha globin gene deletions were associated with decreased arterial alpha globin expression, increased NOS-dependent vasodilation, and lower blood pressure. Mimetic peptides that targeted the interactions between hemoglobin and eNOS recapitulated the effects of these genetic variants on human arterial vasoreactivity. Alpha and beta globin subunits of hemoglobin interact with eNOS to restrict NO signaling in human resistance arteries. Malaria-protective genetic variants that alter the expression of alpha globin or the structure of beta globin are associated with increased NOS-dependent vasodilation. Targeting the hemoglobin-eNOS interface could potentially improve NO signaling in diseases of endothelial dysfunction such as severe malaria or chronic cardiovascular conditions."

    "abstract": "Ineffective erythropoiesis (IE) is defined as the abnormal differentiation and excessive destruction of erythroblasts i n the bone marrow, accompanied by an expanded progenitor compartment and relative reduction in the production of reticulocytes. It is a defining feature of many types of anemia, including β-thalassemia. GATA1 is an essential transcription factor for erythroid differentiation, known to be implicated in hematological conditions presenting with IE, including β-thalassemia and congenital dyserythropoietic anemia. However, little is known about the role of GATA1 in the erythropoietic defects recently described in sickle cell anemia (SCA). In the present study, we performed a detailed characterization of the role of GATA1 and ineffective erythropoiesis in SCA using both in vitro and in vivo assay systems. We demonstrate a significant decrease in GATA1 protein levels during SCA erythropoiesis and a concomitant increase in oxidative stress. Furthermore, we found that an increase in the activity of the inflammatory caspase, caspase 1, was driving the decrease in GATA1 levels during SCA erythropoiesis and that, upon inhibition of caspase 1 activity, SCA erythropoiesis was rescued and GATA1 levels partially restored. Our study further elucidates the defect in erythropoiesis in SCA, and may therefore help in the development of novel approaches to normalize the bone marrow niche prior to stem cell transplantation, or facilitate the production of healthy stem cells for gene therapy."

Traditional treatments have focused on symptom management, but recent advancements in drug delivery systems offer promising pathways for targeted therapies. This abstract explores novel approaches to combat SCA through innovative drug delivery systems, gene therapy, and new pharmaceutical interventions. One novel pathway for targeting SCA involves utilizing advanced drug delivery systems to enhance the effectiveness of therapeutic agents. Nanotechnology-based delivery systems, such as nanoparticles and liposomes, offer precise drug targeting, controlled release, and improved bioavailability. These systems can encapsulate anti-sickling agents, like hydroxyurea, and enable their specific delivery to affected cells, reducing side effects and enhancing therapeutic outcomes. Additionally, therapy has become a ground-breaking method of treating SCA. CRISPR/Cas9 technology presents a groundbreaking opportunity to correct the genetic mutation responsible for sickle hemoglobin production. By precisely editing the HBB gene, which encodes the abnormal hemoglobin, researchers aim to restore normal hemoglobin expression, potentially offering a curative treatment for SCA. Furthermore, recent advancements in drug development have led to the discovery of promising candidates targeting specific pathways involved in SCA pathophysiology. Experimental drugs, such as voxelotor and crizanlizumab focus on modifying hemoglobin properties or inhibiting cell adhesion, respectively, thereby preventing sickle cell-related complications and reducing vaso-occlusive crisis frequency."

SS mice exposed to RSD without treatment had worse performance on cognitive tests compared to SS mice exposed to RSD with treatment or to AA controls, irrespective of their RSD or treatment disposition. Additionally, compared to SS mice exposed to RSD with treatment, SS mice exposed to RSD without treatment had significantly more cellular evidence of neuroinflammation coupled with a significant shift in the differentiation of neural progenitor cells towards astrogliogenesis. Additionally, brain tissue from SS mice exposed to RSD was significantly enriched for genes associated with blood-brain barrier dysfunction, neuron excitotoxicity, inflammation, and significant dysregulation in sphingolipids important to neuronal cell processes. We demonstrate in this study that social stress induces cognitive deficit in SS mice, concurrently with neuroinflammation and lipid dysregulation."

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder with the underlying pathology, resulting in sickling of the red blood cells in deoxygenated conditions. Osteonecrosis is a common orthopaedic manifestation of sickle cell disease, and total joint arthroplasty is the preferred option in managing patients with advanced disease. This article describes bilateral total hip arthroplasty and right total knee arthroplasty (TKA) in a 41-year-old woman, a known haemoglobin SS (HBSS) patient who presented to the outpatient clinic of National Orthopaedic Hospital, Igbobi, Lagos, with recurrent bilateral hip and right knee pain of 10-year duration, with associated stiffness, valgus deformity in the knee and severe limitation of function. She had sequential bilateral total hip replacement and right TKA. She had significant improvement in function in the follow-up period. The effectiveness of total hip and knee arthroplasties in HBSS patients with osteonecrosis is well demonstrated in this article."

    "abstract": "With the improvement in survival and the reduction in morbidity related to sickle cell disease (SCD), aspects related to reproductive health are emerging as a priority in the care of affected people. We conducted a systematic review looking for evidence describing the functional ovarian reserve levels in women with sickle cell disease. To locate studies, a search was performed in electronic databases, in addition to preprint servers and reference lists of selected publications. Two independent reviewers searched, and the risk of bias in the selected studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. 1,086 records were initially retrieved, and one article was identified after consulting the reference lists of the screened articles, only four articles met the eligibility criteria. The quality of evidence was rated very low due to the design of the studies; however, the risk of bias was considered low. These are recent studies published between 2015 and 2021, whose main methodology was a cross-sectional or case-control study. All studies reported lower anti-mullerian hormone levels in women with sickle cell disease. Although lower, anti-mullerian hormone levels were within the normal range in young women with sickle cell disease only with supportive care, in those who used hydroxyurea, a decrease in ovarian reserve was observed. support insufficient evidence support a causal relationship between sickle cell disease and reduced ovarian reserve. From anti-mullerian hormone values a trend towards lower levels in women with sickle cell disease compared to healthy women, as reported in the four studies evaluated. Studies that analyze the ovarian reserve based on imaging and biochemical parameters are an important future focus."

    "abstract": "Silent cerebral infarcts (SCIs) are present in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) and thalassemia, but the pathophysiology of SCIs is not fully understood. Previous studies mainly focused on cerebral hemodynamics and oxygen metabolism in patients with severe SCD (HbSS/HbSβ°) but not in milder forms of SCD (HbSC/HbSβ<sup>+</sup>) and thalassemia despite the high prevalence of SCIs in these patients. In this work, we studied the cerebral hemodynamics and oxygen metabolism, and SCI lesion load in 75 severe and 26 mild adult SCD patients, 18 thalassemia patients (as anemic comparison group), and 30 healthy controls before and after a vasodilatory challenge with acetazolamide. Cerebral blood flow was significantly higher in patients with severe SCD and thalassemia compared to patients with mild SCD and controls (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Conversely, oxygen extraction fraction and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO<sub>2</sub>) were significantly lower in patients with severe SCD and thalassemia compared to other groups (<i>p</i> < 0.01). In contrast, no difference in SCI volumes was found between mild and severe SCD and thalassemia patients. After acetazolamide administration, oxygen delivery increased less in severe SCD and thalassemia patients compared to other groups (<i>p</i> < 0.01) and CMRO<sub>2</sub> decreased only in severe SCD patients (<i>p</i> < 0.01). Given the reduced CMRO<sub>2</sub> values in severe SCD and thalassemia patients, we conclude that reduced cerebral oxygen consumption in these patient groups is mostly related to anemia. Our data suggest that the pathophysiology of SCIs in patients with milder forms of SCD might be more related to prior episodes of anemia or other sickle cell-related factors."

    "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> Hydroxyurea (HU) is a disease-modifying therapy with significant clinical and laboratory efficacy among individuals living with sickle cell anaemia (SCA). This is evident through increased fetal haemoglobin, higher packed cell volume, improved red cell hydration, reduced leukocytes, and platelet function. The effect on the coagulation pathway and pathophysiologic mechanism remains unclear, especially in children living with SCA. This study evaluated the coagulation profile using D-dimer and thrombin antithrombin complex (TAT) in children with SCA. <b>Methods:</b> The cross-sectional study was conducted over three months at LUTH among 80 children living with SCA in steady state aged 2-18 years (40 HU exposed and 40 HU naïve, respectively). Blood samples were assayed for D-dimer, TAT, and complete blood count. Descriptive analysis such as mean and standard deviation for normally distributed variables or median and interquartile range for skewed data were used to summarize continuous variables, while proportion or percentages for categorical variables. Univariate analysis and bivariate analysis were done and statistical significance was set at <i>p</i> < 0.05. <b>Results:</b> The mean age (±SD) of study participants in both groups was 11.35 (±4.6 years). D-dimer levels (23.27 ng/mL) and TAT (29.79 pg/mL) were significantly lower among HU exposed compared to HU naïve children (62.73 ng/mL and 109.34 pg/mL, respectively) <i>p</i> < 0.001. There was a negative correlation between D-dimer and TAT with the duration of HU use (<i>r</i> = -0.499, <i>p</i>=0.001, and <i>r</i> = -0.401, <i>p</i>=0.010), respectively. There was a positive correlation between D-dimer and TAT with total WBC (<i>r</i> = 0.368, <i>p</i>=0.019, and <i>r</i> = 0.385, <i>p</i>=0.014, respectively) among the HU naïve participants and a negative correlation between D-dimer and TAT with haemoglobin level (<i>r</i> = -0.303, <i>p</i>=0.047, and <i>r</i> = -0.311, <i>p</i>=0.041, respectively) among HU exposed children. <b>Conclusion:</b> HU modulates the D-dimer and TAT levels of children living with SCA toward the normal reference range, thus reducing the risk of hypercoagulability and associated sequelae. Therefore, continuous advocacy for HU use should entail close monitoring of adverse effects."

    "abstract": "Homozygous inheritance of the R<sup>N</sup> haplotype, characterized by the absence of the high frequency antigen Sec, as well as partial C and e antigens, is rare and is associated with potential for alloimmunization. Anti-Sec has been reported to be associated with a risk of delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction and hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDFN). We report the case of a 36-year-old pregnant woman with known sickle cell trait (SCT) and homozygous for the R<sup>N</sup> haplotype with anti-Sec, anti-c, and anti-e. Morphological ultrasound identified dextro-transposition of the great arteries in the fetus. Neonatal cardiac surgery was planned with cardiopulmonary bypass support. Due to the rarity of this genotype, there were no compatible donors in our registry. For this reason, in addition to two previously glycerolized maternal donations, the mother donated three units during pregnancy and one unit postpartum. This case highlights the many complexities for the blood supplier pertaining to organizing blood donations during pregnancy, the risk of leukoreduction failure and jellification during the deglycerolization process of units from donors with rare blood carrying the SCT, as well as planning the rare-blood inventory and managing expiry dates to provide transfusion support during delivery, neonatal surgery, and the postoperative period. This case also exemplifies the importance of a strong partnership between blood suppliers and medical teams."

Prophylactic antigen matching is commonly used to prevent alloimmunization, but the evidence supporting this common practice is very limited.

A thorough history taking and comprehensive assessment, along with an open-minded approach can enhance clinical decision-making processes when caring for patients presenting with shoulder pain. A 35-year-old male presented to the ED with left shoulder pain. He was given a low priority score as he did not report any significant previous history or trauma, appeared well, and reported a low pain score at the time of presentation. The open-minded approach by the Advanced Nurse Practitioner led to an appropriate diagnosis, pain management, care, and follow up for the patient. This case underscored the critical importance of 'probe and probe again' until a clear rationale emerged for the aetiology of the shoulder pain experienced by a young and healthy patient."

    "abstract": "<b>Introduction:</b> Sickle cell emergencies are the most common cause of hospitalization for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). Hospital readmissions represent a considerable financial burden for healthcare systems and increase patient morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence and predictive factors of sickle cell emergencies readmission. <b>Materials and Methods:</b> We conducted a prospective, cross-sectional, descriptive, and analytical study over a 4-month period, including all adult patients admitted for an emergency related to SCD: vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC), acute chest syndrome (ACS), severe anemia, infections, priapism, and stroke. Readmission was considered when the patient returned to the emergency within a period of <30 days, either due to recurrence, persistence of the same complication, or the occurrence of another acute complication related to SCD. <b>Results:</b> We recorded 151 sickle cell emergencies for 112 patients, representing 0.33 emergencies/month/patient. Fifty-eight cases of readmission were recorded, resulting in a readmission rate of 38.41%. Among these patients, 53 (91.37%) had two admissions, and 5 (8.62%) had three admissions. The median age of the patients was 28.41 years (16-70 years), and the sex ratio was 0.57. The SS sickle cell phenotype was predominant in 97 patients (86.61%). The reasons for readmission were VOC (82.75%), ACS (13.72%), and severe anemia (3.44%). The main factors that predicted readmission were the existence of professional activity, a low fetal hemoglobin (HbF) level, the existence of neutrophilia, lymphocytosis, and/or thrombocytosis (<i>p</i> values of 0.0084, 0.043, and 0.020 respectively). <b>Conclusion:</b> The 30-day readmission rate after a sickle cell emergency is high in our study. The main factors that predicted readmission were the existence of professional activity, a relatively low level of fetal Hb, the existence of neutrophilia, lymphocytosis, and/or thrombocytosis."

This review aimed to elucidate various attributes and related concepts of HRQOL in children and adolescents with SCD using Rodgers' et al. (2018) concept analysis framework. A systematic search was performed to identify studies reporting the attributes, antecedents, consequences, surrogate terms, and related concepts of HRQOL in children and adolescents with SCD. The review included 75 articles, including 70 quantitative, two mixed-methods, and three qualitative studies. These were categorized into attributes, antecedents, consequences, surrogate terms, related concepts, and an exemplar of HRQOL in children and adolescents with SCD. The review identified nine important attributes. It includes multidimensional and dynamic concepts, acknowledging the illness, maintaining emotional balance and self-control, coping with the disease, pain management, stigma and discrimination, treatment burden, palliative care and personal resilience. The antecedents were knowledge and attitude toward the disease, self-efficacy, social support, spirituality and spiritual well-being, disease severity, access to healthcare, environmental factors, and financial considerations. The consequences were independence in personal life, improved physical health outcomes, psychological well-being, family and caregiver well-being, improved family, social and peer relationships and social interactions, improved school performance, and improved overall HRQOL and long-term outcomes. This analysis provides an overview of HRQOL concepts related to children and adolescents with SCD, guiding further research into nursing care and clinical practice."

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited hemolytic disorder accompanied by chronic pain and recurrent acute painful episodes known as vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs). Increased Glx (glutamate+glutamine) and lowered GABA concentration have been reported in the insula of patients with fibromyalgia, a nociplastic chronic pain condition, and may affect the pathophysiology of pain-related syndromes.Therefore, proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<sup>1</sup>H-MRS) was conducted to measure levels of Glx and other brain metabolites using a single voxel (size: 2×3×3 cm<sup>3</sup>) in the right posterior insula cortex (PIC) in 17 individuals with SCD and 17 ethnicity-, age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HCs). The frequency of VOCs in the preceding 12 months was recorded. The concentration of Glx (p=0.019) and the ratio of Glx to tCr (total creatine, p=0.035) in the PIC were significantly higher in patients with SCD as compared to matched HCs (n=17). Secondary analyses with the unpaired full sample of 24 SCD also showed a significantly higher level of Glx/tCr than HCs (n=19), with a positive correlation between the level of Glx/tCr and the number of VOCs (p=0.034, r=0.476), as well as a negative correlation between Glx and sensory sensitivity assessed by tonic pressure pain in gastrocnemius area of the non-dominant leg (p=0.040, r=-0.462). The unpaired full sample additionally revealed a significant difference in sensory sensitivity (p=0.050). Altered metabolites such as GABA and myo-inositol were also observed between SCD and HCs. These results suggest that elevated excitatory neurotransmission in the insula might contribute to nociplastic pain in SCD. PERSPECTIVE: Our work highlighted the innovative finding of elevated levels of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate with glutamine in patients with SCD compared to healthy controls. The positive relationship between Glx/tCr and the frequency of VOCs suggests that an excitatory brain neurotransmitter imbalance may be involved in VOCs."

    "abstract": "Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) experience pain in their daily lives. Both the acute and chronic pain phenotypes of this disease exhibit high variability, making pain management a challenge. The underlying reasons for the phenotypic variability are poorly understood. Given the importance of serotonergic neurotransmission in pain signaling, we aimed to explore the role of variants in the 5-HT1A receptor gene (HTR1A) on pain variability in SCD. Four variants (rs6449693, rs878567, rs6294, and rs10042486) in HTR1A were genotyped in a cohort of 131 African Americans with SCD. Acute and chronic pain were measured by the acute care utilization and the McGill Pain Questionnaire, respectively. Association analyses were performed for three genetic models (additive, dominant, and recessive). Three variants (rs6449693, rs6294, and rs10042486) in HTR1A showed significant association with crisis pain in both the additive and dominant models. Although the G allele of rs6449693 and the C allele of rs10042486 associated with lower acute crisis pain, the T allele of rs6294 associated with increased acute crisis pain. Sex-stratified analyses revealed that the associations of these three variants with acute pain were significant only in men, but not in women. Furthermore, the A allele rs878567 that did not reach statistical significance in the overall cohort showed a significant association with lower crisis pain in men. To our knowledge, as the first study to explore the role of HTR1A variants in sickle cell pain, we identified that four variants across the gene are associated with acute crisis pain in SCD in a sex-stratified manner."

When detecting homozygous SCD, the pooled sensitivity and specificity of the included LFIAs and micro-engineered electrophoresis POCTs was 92 % or higher in all individual meta-analyses. Sensitivities and specificities were also nearly 100 % when detecting haemoglobin SC disease for these POCTs. POCTs could be used to accurately diagnose SCD."

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is one of the most common genetic diseases in the world, annually affecting approximately 310 000 births and causing >100 000 deaths. Vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) is the most frequent complication of SCD, leading to bone pain, thoracic pain (acute chest syndrome) and/or abdominal spasms. It is the main cause of mortality in patients with SCD, reducing life expectancy. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) is a safe and well-established method of increasing tissue oxygen delivery immediately by up to 10-fold to 20-fold. In the context of VOC, HBOT has the potential to limit sickling. A previous pilot study of nine patients showed the safety and potential benefits of HBOT on VOC-induced pain. Our study aimed to assess the clinical safety and effectiveness of HBOT for treating VOC, its biological mechanisms of actions and its cost-effectiveness. This is a multicentric, triple-blinded, randomised controlled trial. Patients aged 8 years or above with a diagnosed major form of SCD, presenting at one of the participating centres' emergency departments (EDs) with a VOC requiring level 3 analgesia (according to WHO definition), will be eligible. Exclusion criteria are pregnancy, mechanical ventilation, previous history of stroke or prior transcranial Doppler ultrasound anomaly, contraindication to HBOT and the need for above 2 L/min of oxygen. All patients will receive the usual care for VOCs, including hydration, analgesics, normobaric oxygen therapy and when medically indicated, antibiotic therapy and/or transfusions. Within 24 hours of their arrival in the ED (or longer in specific cases), and after obtaining informed consent, patients will be randomised into the HBOT intervention group (2.0 atmosphere absolute (ATA), 90 min, FIO<sub>2</sub>=1) or the sham group (1.3 ATA, 90 min, FIO<sub>2</sub>=0.21). After their first HBOT session, patients will return to their acute-care ward. Patients in both arms will undergo a second and third session within 24-36 hours of the first, unless their Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)-pain is ≤2 without use of level 3 analgesics. The difference in the pain-VAS before and after HBOT and other outcomes will be compared between the intervention and sham groups. Our composite primary outcome will be (1) the change in global VAS-pain 6 hours after initiation of HBOT; (2) the number of patients with a VAS-pain score >4 and/or a morphine dosage >1 mg/hour intravenous after the HBOT/sham session. Other outcomes to be reported are morphine usage, length of stay, biological parameters, satisfaction, complications and cost. Ethical approval CER Geneva 2019-01707 (last submission V.5.1, 06.15.2023). The results of the studies will be disseminated by several media, including publications in peer-reviewed international medical journals, and presentations at national and/or international conferences.

    "abstract": "Moyamoya syndrome (MMS) is a subset of moyamoya disease (MMD) with a systemic comorbidity. Due to the lack of direct comparisons between various MMS subgroups and their MMD counterparts, we aimed to analyze differences in stroke-related outcomes between MMS subgroups and patients with MMD through propensity score matching (PSM). We analyzed the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) from 2011 to 2020 for patients with MMD and common MMS-related comorbidities: Down syndrome (DS), sickle-cell disease (SCD), and type 1 neurofibromatosis (NF1). PSM was performed to match patients of each MMS subgroup to patients with MMD only, controlling for stroke risk factors. Rates of ischemic strokes, hemorrhagic strokes, and transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) were evaluated after matching. A total of 10,652 patients with a moyamoya diagnosis were identified: 7971 with MMD only, 2202 with MMS-SCD, 162 with MMS-NF1, and 317 with MMS-DS. PSM for MMD only and MMS-SCD resulted in 630 matched pairs. After matching, univariate analysis showed that patients with MMS-SCD had significantly lower rates of ischemic strokes (8.9% vs. 17.9%; P = 0.001), hemorrhagic strokes (5.1% vs. 8.1%; P = 0.031), and TIAs (2.2% vs. 4.6%; P = 0.020) than did patients with MMD only. For the MMS-DS subgroup, 92 matched pairs showed significantly lower rates of TIAs than did patients with MMD only (0% vs. 6.5%; P = 0.013). Comparing 54 matched pairs of patients with MMD only and patients with MMS-NF1 showed no significant differences in stroke-related outcomes. Patients with MMS-SCD had significantly lower rates of acute ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, and TIA compared with patients with MMD only. Future research should consider the source of these differences in improving stroke prevention in patients with MMD."

Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) can improve health-related quality of life (HRQOL) but may be physically and emotionally challenging. Thus, the aim of this study was to understand the experience of HCT from the perspective of youth and young adults (YYAs) post-HCT for SCD and their parents. YYAs were recruited from an urban hospital. Sociodemographic and HCT-specific information was analyzed for all enrolled. YYAs and/or their primary caregivers during HCT, participated in semi-structured interviews (e.g., pre-HCT knowledge, challenges, advice for families/health care providers). Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using content analysis. There were 19 YYAs enrolled (63.2% male; 68.4% Black or African American; 47.4% Hispanic or Latino; M days post-HCT = 1946.53 ± 1329.13; M age at HCT = 10.95 ± 6.10 years old; M current age 15.74 ± 5.78 years old). Interviews were done with six YYAs alone, five YYA-caregiver dyads, and eight caregivers alone. The caregivers were all mothers. Participants reported underestimating the emotional impact HCT would have on themselves and their family members. They experienced challenges related to isolation, academics, finances, and post-HCT medical needs. In contrast, they felt well prepared for physiological aspects of HCT. They sought HCT to improve YYAs' HRQOL and encouraged others to consider it, but to be cognizant of the potential psychosocial impact. This study highlights the importance of preparing families for the psychosocial effects of HCT. Incorporating psychosocial assessment, education, and intervention throughout HCT has the potential to promote HRQOL for YYAs and their families."

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most common inherited blood disease. Disease-modifying therapy and supportive care have improved the survival of children with SCD in the United States and Europe. Yet, adults with SCD continue to have high risks of morbidity and early death. Recently, 2 US Food and Drug Administration-approved genetic therapies offer the potential for a short-term decrease in acute vaso-occlusive pain events if not cure. Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) is also curative but, until recently, was constrained by limited donor availability and the risks of graft-versus-host disease, graft rejection, and death. Importantly, recent advances have attenuated these barriers. Here, we discuss the current state of therapies with curative intent for SCD. Both genetic therapy and allo-HCT offer the potential for cure for most with SCD. However, the cost (∼5 times higher), the current need for myeloablation, and associated late-health effects may make genetic therapies less favorable choices than allo-HCT."

    "abstract": "Genetic newborn screening (NBS) has already entered the phase of common practice in many countries. In Germany, spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) and sickle cell disease (SCD) are currently a mandatory part of NBS. Here, we describe the experience of six years of genetic NBS including the prevalence of those three diseases in Germany. Samples and nucleic acids were extracted from dried blood spot cards, commonly used for NBS. A qPCR assay was used to detect disease-causing variants for SMA and SCD, and the detection of T-cell receptor excision circles (TRECs) was performed for SCID screening. The results of the NBS of over 1 million newborns for SMA, approximately 770,000 for SCID and over 410,000 for SCD are discussed in detail. In these newborns, we have identified 121 cases of SMA, 15 cases of SCID and syndrome-based immunodeficiencies and 77 cases of SCD or β-thalassemia. The flexibility of multiplex qPCR is assessed as an effective tool for incorporating different molecular genetic markers for screening. The processing of dried blood spot (DBS) filter cards for molecular genetic assays and the assays are described in detail; turn-around times and cost estimations are included to give an insight into the processes and discuss further options for optimization. The identified cases are in the range expected for the total number of screened newborns, but present a more exact view on the actual prevalences for Germany."

    "abstract": "In recent studies, it has been shown that fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) may reveal intracellular structural details in unstained cytological preparations that are not revealed by standard staining procedures. The aim of our investigation was to examine whether FLIM images could reveal areas suggestive of polymerization in red blood cells (RBCs) of sickle cell disease (SCD) patients. We examined label-free blood films using auto-fluorescence FLIM images of 45 SCD patients and compared the results with those of 27 control persons without hematological disease. All control RBCs revealed homogeneous cytoplasm without any foci. Rounded non-sickled RBCs in SCD showed between zero and three small intensively fluorescent dots with higher lifetime values. In sickled RBCs, we found additionally larger irregularly shaped intensively fluorescent areas with increased FLIM values. These areas were interpreted as equivalent to polymerized hemoglobin. The rounded, non-sickled RBCs of SCD patients with homogeneous cytoplasm were not different from those of the erythrocytes of control patients in light microscopy. Yet, variables from the local binary pattern-transformed matrix of the FLIM values per pixel showed significant differences between non-sickled RBCs and those of control cells. In a linear discriminant analysis, using local binary pattern-transformed texture features (mean and entropy) of the erythrocyte cytoplasm of normal appearing cells, the final model could distinguish between SCD patients and control persons with an accuracy of 84.7% of the patients. When the classification was based on the examination of a single rounded erythrocyte, an accuracy of 68.5% was achieved. Employing the Linear Discriminant Analysis classifier method for machine learning, the accuracy was 68.1%. We believe that our study shows that FLIM is able to disclose the topography of the intracellular polymerization process of hemoglobin in sickle cell disease and that the images are compatible with the theory of the two-step nucleation. Furthermore, we think that the presented technique may be an interesting tool for the investigation of therapeutic inhibition of polymerization."

    "title": "Genetic Modifiers of Hemoglobin Expression from a Clinical Perspective in Hemoglobinopathy Patients with Beta Thalassemia and Sickle Cell Disease.",
    "abstract": "Hemoglobinopathies, namely β-thalassemia and sickle cell disease (SCD), are hereditary diseases, characterized by molecular genetic aberrations in the beta chains of hemoglobin. These defects affect the normal production of hemoglobin with severe anemia due to less or no amount of beta globins in patients with β-thalassemia (quantitative disorder), while SCD is a serious disease in which a mutated form of hemoglobin distorts the red blood cells into a crescent shape at low oxygen levels (qualitative disorder). Despite the revolutionary progress in recent years with the approval of gene therapy and gene editing for specific patients, there is an unmet need for highlighting the mechanisms influencing hemoglobin production and for the development of novel drugs and targeted therapies. The identification of the transcription factors and other genetic modifiers of hemoglobin expression is of utmost importance for discovering novel therapeutic approaches for patients with hemoglobinopathies. The aim of this review is to describe these complex molecular mechanisms and pathways affecting hemoglobin expression and to highlight the relevant investigational approaches or pharmaceutical interventions focusing on restoring the hemoglobin normal function by linking the molecular background of the disease with the clinical perspective. All the associated drugs increasing the hemoglobin expression in patients with hemoglobinopathies, along with gene therapy and gene editing, are also discussed."

    "title": "Sympathetic hypoactivity leads to hypocontractility of the corpus cavernosum in sickle cell mice: a mechanism contributing to priapism.",
    "abstract": "Priapism, a prevalent complication in sickle cell disease (SCD) patients, manifests as prolonged and painful erections unrelated to sexual arousal. The detailed mechanisms contributing to this condition, especially regarding sympathetic function in the corpus cavernosum that maintains penile flaccidity, remain to be elucidated. In this study, it was hypothesized that the pathways of the sympathetic nervous system would be down-regulated, thereby contributing to the development of ischemic priapism in sickle cell disease. This study aimed to investigate the contractions induced by stimulation of sympathetic terminals and the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase in the corpora cavernosa of Berkeley SCD mice. C57BL/6 mice (wild-type, WT) and Berkeley SCD mice were used. A total of 22 mice were used in this study, with 11 allocated to the WT group and 11 to the SCD group. Mice corpus cavernosum was dissected free and mounted in 7-mL organ baths containing Krebs solution. Noradrenergic contractions were obtained using electrical-field stimulation (4-32 Hz) in corpus cavernosum strips from WT and SCD mice. Measurements of tyrosine hydroxylase phosphorylated at Ser-31 and total tyrosine hydroxylase protein expressions in cavernosal tissues were also measured by western blot. The neurogenic contractions were significantly lower (P < 0.05) in the SCD group compared to WT group at all tested frequencies. The protein expression of both total tyrosine hydroxylase and tyrosine hydroxylase phosphorylated at Ser-31 was significantly decreased by approximately 46.28% (P = 0.01) and 55.32% (P = 0.03) in cavernosal tissues from the SCD group compared to the control group, respectively. In conclusion, sympathetic hypoactivity characterized by the downregulation of tyrosine hydroxylase contributes to the hypocontractility of the corpus cavernosum in Berkeley SCD mice. This suggests an impairment in the mechanism responsible for maintaining penile flaccidity, potentially predisposing to erections without sexual stimulation, similar to those observed in ischemic priapism. Pharmacological treatments aiming to restore sympathetic tone in the penis might hold promise for addressing ischemic priapism in SCD."

    "abstract": "Dexamethasone is a steroid used in the treatment of hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19. However, the effect of dexamethasone in patients with SCD remains unclear given that steroids may precipitate vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) in patients with SCD. We performed a retrospective analysis of patients with SCD who were hospitalized at Johns Hopkins Health System between June 1, 2020 and June 26, 2022. We reviewed individual charts to assess severity of illness and eligibility for dexamethasone treatment. The exposure of interest was treatment with dexamethasone. Outcomes of interest included incident VTE, length of hospital stay, ICU admission, follow up-VOC and mortality. We identified 30 patients with SCD and COVID-19 who were eligible for dexamethasone treatment, 13 of whom received dexamethasone. Dexamethasone was associated with an increased risk of incident VTE (risk difference = 36%; 95% CI 8%, 66%) after adjustment for high-risk genotypes, >3 hospitalizations, and receipt of anticoagulation. There was an increase in the risk difference of ICU admission and an increased length of stay in crude and adjusted analyses however these associations were not statistically significant. We analyzed outcomes among patients with SCD who were hospitalized for COVID-19 and eligible for dexamethasone. Our study suggests that in this population, treatment with dexamethasone increases the risk of incident VTE. There was a suggestion of an increased risk of ICU admission as well as increased length of hospitalization; larger studies are needed to confirm these findings."

    "abstract": "This study aimed to review the current knowledge on priapism in the paediatric and adolescent population through a review of the current literature. Priapism is defined as a prolonged and persistent penile erection lasting over 4 h, unassociated with a sexual stimulus or persisting after ejaculation and orgasm. It has an incidence of 0.3-1.5 per 100,000 per annum in males of all ages, and comprises 3 main types: ischaemic, non-ischaemic and stuttering. The most common cause of priapism in children is sickle cell disease, and these individuals usually have the ischaemic type of priapism, which is a true urological emergency. We discuss in this article the management pathways for children and young adults, with the main emphasis being on accurate diagnosis and emergent management. Erectile dysfunction is the main consequence of delayed management."

    "abstract": "This study investigated the prevalence of sickle cell disease, β-thalassemia, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and hepatitis C virus (HCV) and their demographic associations in Riyadh, KSA. A retrospective cross-sectional design was used for this study. National data were obtained from The Healthy Marriage Program for the Riyadh region. Variables involved in the data collection tool were demographic data, lab results for hematology and serology tests and diagnosis, and the status of the certificate. A single sample K-S test was used to determine the normality of the data. We used the multiple logistic regression model. The odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) were reported for both bivariate and multivariable analyses. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The study screened a total of 916,295 participants, comprising 452,474 in 2021 and 463,821 in 2022. The sex distribution was 51.7% male and 48.3% female, with a mean age (± standard deviation) of 43 (±11.8) in 2021 and 41 (±11.9) in 2022. Among the participants, there were 196 sickle cell disease (SCD) cases and 4610 carriers. Additionally, 1069 participants tested positive for infectious diseases. Sex was a notable factor in SCD, HIV, HBV, and HCV cases. Our findings highlight the importance of ongoing surveillance and intervention efforts through programs such as premarital screening and genetic counseling programs. These initiatives are crucial for identifying at-risk individuals and reducing the burden of genetic disorders and infectious diseases with targeted public health strategies. Future research should focus on longitudinal studies to monitor trends and assess the long-term impact of preventive measures on disease prevalence and distribution in the region."

    "title": "Screening for pulmonary hypertension in pregnant women with sickle cell disease in sub-Saharan Africa.",
    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) has evolved from a condition predominantly fatal in childhood to a chronic illness impacting many adults, including women of reproductive age. For females with SCD, pregnancy represents one of the greatest health threats, exacerbating existing health challenges and introducing new risks. Despite advancements in healthcare, routine screening for existing complications like pulmonary hypertension (PH) remains inconsistent, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where the prevalence of SCD is highest. This study aimed to assess the feasibility of screening for PH in pregnant women with SCD in LMICs, with the goal of enhancing maternal health outcomes in this vulnerable population. A prospective multi-center feasibility study was conducted from September 2022 to February 2023 at teaching hospitals in Ghana and Nigeria. The study included pregnant women with SCD between 28 and 34 weeks of gestation. Screening for PH utilized a tricuspid regurgitation velocity (TRV) criterion (>2.5 m/s), with adherence to American Society of Echocardiography guidelines. Statistical analysis included descriptive statistics and proportions. Among 3091 pregnant women attending antenatal care, 88 had SCD (2.8%), and 55 were eligible for the study. We recruited 44 participants (mean age 28.9 years, SD 4.8), with 48% (21/44) SS genotype and 52% (23/44) SC genotype. Most participants (95.3%) had normal TRV (<2.5 m/s), with only one showing elevated TRV, successfully referred. Protocol adherence was 100%. Antenatal outcomes showed 95% echo uptake and 95.7% retention to term whilst postnatal echo follow-up was 43.5%. Notably, 27.1% (10/37) of deliveries required neonatal intensive care unit admission, and 18.2% were preterm. The sole participant with PH required intensive care unit care and experienced a preterm delivery with neonatal death on day 5. Screening and referral for PH in pregnant women with SCD in LMICs are feasible but face challenges in early diagnosis, healthcare personnel availability, and postnatal follow-up. Strategic planning is crucial to address these challenges and improve outcomes in this high-risk population."

    "title": "Sonographic Assessment of Splenic Manifestations in Sickle Cell Disease Patients and Its Relation to Hematological Parameters: A Cross-Sectional Study in Basra, Iraq.",
    "abstract": "Background Hemoglobinopathies, such as sickle cell disease (SCD), are inherited disorders of hemoglobin (Hb) synthesis. SCD presents with complex clinical manifestations, including anemia, painful episodes, and organ damage due to recurrent vaso-occlusion. The spleen is one of the first organs affected in SCD patients, with hyposplenism typically occurring by age five. However, older patients may show variations in splenic size, which can complicate the diagnosis. Objective This study aimed to investigate the radiological manifestations of the spleen in patients with SCD using sonographic assessment and the relationship between these manifestations and the patient's clinical and laboratory findings. Methodology This descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out at the Basra Hematology Center, which is the largest center for hematological diseases in the southern part of Iraq. It was carried out over a three-month period from May 22 to August 22, 2024. A total of 81 patients aged 15 and above, diagnosed with SCD, and attending the outpatient clinic at Basra Hematology Center in Basra city were included. Participants were identified through medical records and referrals from private outpatient clinics. Inclusion criteria ensured participants had a confirmed SCD diagnosis and met the age requirements. Exclusion criteria eliminated individuals with sickle cell trait, other hemolytic anemias, leukemia, relevant co-morbidities, or those who declined participation. After obtaining informed consent, each patient was interviewed by the research team, their blood was taken for lab tests, and then an ultrasound scan of their spleen was performed. Results Regarding the demographic characteristics of patients, age showed a statistically significant difference across the groups (p=0.017), indicating that marked splenomegaly is associated with younger individuals (mean age of 19.50 ± 4.95 years) compared to autosplenectomy, which is linked to older patients (mean age of 35.42 ± 11.84 years). Regarding radiological findings, splenic size was categorized into normal size, splenomegaly, small spleen, and autosplenectomy. Increased echogenicity is more frequently seen in the small spleen group (87.5%, p<0.001). Focal lesions, such as infarctions, were relatively uncommon and did not show significant variation across the groups. However, the presence of Gamna-Gandy bodies (GGB) was reported in a few patients and did not vary significantly among spleen status groups. The laboratory data showed notable significant differences in several key blood parameters. Hb levels were significantly lower in patients with marked splenomegaly (6.65 ± 0.21 g/dl) compared to other groups (p=0.01). White blood cell count (WBC) and platelet count (PLT) were significantly higher in the autosplenectomy group (WBC 12.29 ± 5.67 x 10³/μL; PLT 426.16 ± 222.85 x 10³/μL), both with p-values <0.001. Conclusion This study examined splenic changes in SCD patients, finding that autosplenectomy is more common in older patients, while splenomegaly is prevalent in younger ones. Increased splenic echogenicity indicated fibrosis, and patients with splenomegaly showed lower hemoglobin levels. Autosplenectomy was associated with higher WBC and PLT levels. Although elevated HbF and certain genetic factors seemed protective against splenic atrophy, these findings were not statistically significant, warranting further research."

    "title": "Vitamin D Deficiency and Avascular Necrosis in Patients With Sickle Cell Disease: A Retrospective Cohort Study.",
    "abstract": "Introduction Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited hemoglobinopathy with complex multi-systemic involvement. Avascular necrosis (AVN) is a devastating complication among patients with SCD. Vitamin D deficiency (VDD) is a common finding in SCD patients. However, there is a paucity of research that evaluates the potential role of VDD as a risk factor for AVN in patients with SCD. This study aimed to assess the association between VDD and AVN and determine the patterns of presentation, risk factors, diagnosis, and treatment of AVN in patients with SCD. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study of consecutive SCD patients diagnosed with VDD from January 2020 to December 2022 at Prince Sultan Medical Military City (PSMMC), Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Inclusion criteria: (1) adults and children with confirmed SCD and (2) tested for VDD. We excluded patients who underwent bone marrow transplants. The associations were assessed using the chi-square test. Logistic regression was performed to control for confounding. Results The study included 711 eligible patients; 271 (38%) were children. VDD affected 301/711 (42.3%). VDD was noticed in 32.2% and 48.1% of children and adults, respectively. AVN was diagnosed in 127/711 (17.9%) patients. The mean age at AVN diagnosis was 30.9 ± 11 years. The most common presentation of AVN was chronic joint pain (> 95%). The most frequently affected joint was the hip (86%). The majority of patients (76.4%) were late in stage at diagnosis of AVN (III/IV). Patients with a history of VDD were significantly associated with a higher risk of AVN (p < 0.001). Using multivariate logistic regression, SCD patients with VDD have 9.79 times the odds of AVN compared with SCD patients without VDD (OR 9.79; 95% CI: 5.25 - 18.26). Other statistically significant risk factors for AVN included frequent vaso-occlusive crises, older age, history of acute chest syndrome, and high body mass index. Conclusion AVN is a significant cause of morbidity in our SCD cohort. Most of the patients had advanced AVN disease. VDD is an independent risk factor for the occurrence of AVN. Well-designed randomized trials are required to determine the effect of vitamin D supplementation in reducing AVN in patients with SCD."

    "title": "Potential therapeutic uses of L-citrulline beyond genetic urea cycle disorders.",
    "abstract": "L-citrulline (referred to hereafter as citrulline), a non-essential amino acid and an intermediate in the urea cycle, is widely recognized for its role in managing genetic urea cycle disorders (UCDs). Recent studies, however, suggest that citrulline's therapeutic potential extends beyond UCDs, particularly in conditions associated with nitric oxide (NO) deficiency, endothelial dysfunction, and oxidative stress. This review explores citrulline's emerging applications in sickle cell disease (SCD), post-operative pulmonary hypertension (PH), hepatic veno-occlusive disease (HVOD), and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), as well as its speculative use in asthma and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In SCD, citrulline may restore NO bioavailability, potentially reducing the incidence and severity of vaso-occlusive crises and preventing complications like pulmonary hypertension. In the context of post-operative PH, citrulline's capacity to enhance NO production can improve pulmonary vascular resistance, decrease right ventricular strain, and reduce the need for mechanical ventilation. Citrulline's protective effects on endothelial function and its ability to mitigate oxidative stress offer promising adjunctive therapy for HVOD, particularly in patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation. In BPD, citrulline could promote alveolar development, reduce inflammation, and improve long-term respiratory outcomes. Despite these promising findings, further research is necessary to determine optimal dosing strategies and to evaluate long-term efficacy and safety. The potential role of citrulline in modulating NO production in conditions like asthma and ARDS also warrants further investigation. This review underscores the versatile therapeutic potential of citrulline and highlights the need for continued research into its applications across various conditions associated with NO deficiency and endothelial dysfunction."

    "abstract": "Chronic red blood cell (RBC) transfusion is an established therapy to prevent stroke in patients with sickle cell anemia (SCA). It is unclear if adding daily hydroxyurea treatment to chronic transfusion is beneficial. We conducted a phase 2 clinical trial (NCT03644953) investigating the addition of dose-escalated hydroxyurea to chronic transfusion for patients with SCA receiving simple chronic transfusion for stroke prevention. Simple chronic transfusion therapy was administered as per the same protocol before and after hydroxyurea treatment in which the volume transfused was dependent on the pretransfusion hemoglobin (Hb). A total of 14 participants enrolled with nine completing one year of combination hydroxyurea and transfusion (HAT) therapy after reaching hydroxyurea target dose. No participant who discontinued the study prematurely had a serious adverse event attributed to HAT. Among the nine participants who completed the study, eight participants achieved a reduction in RBC transfusion volume with a median reduction of -19.4 mL/kg/year (interquartile range -31.8, -2.8 mL/kg/year), p = .02, when comparing pre- and post-HAT time periods. With the addition of hydroxyurea participants had a significant increase in pretransfusion Hb S% but this was balanced by an increased Hb F% and decreased lactate dehydrogenase. One participant developed a pretransfusion Hb >11 g/dL and Hb S > 45% that required holding hydroxyurea and changing to partial manual exchange transfusions. No patient had evidence of cerebrovascular disease progression. Hydroxyurea added to chronic transfusion therapy for patients with SCA is feasible and decreases RBC transfusion volume requirements."

The patient was a 34-year-old man known case of sickle cell trait, presented with abdominal pain, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, constipation, and weight loss of 5 kg during three weeks. The vital signs were within normal ranges. His physical examination revealed abdominal tenderness on the right lower quadrant. Abdominal CT scan showed severe abdominopelvic ascites with ileocecal mass and nodular thickening of the parietal peritoneum. The patient underwent a cecum mass with peritoneal mass resection and appendectomy. In histopathology, Burkitt's lymphoma with peritoneal, omentum, and appendix involvement was diagnosed. For further evaluation, the patient underwent a bone marrow trephine biopsy that was involved. Finally, the patient was diagnosed with Burkitt's lymphoma with multi-organ involvement. Patients with sporadic BL often present with advanced-stage disease due to the short doubling time of the tumor. In histopathology, the lymph node architecture effaces completely with starry sky appearance. The GI wall thickening and lumen Stenosis are common in cases with gastrointestinal Lymphoma.

    "abstract": "Chest pain is a common symptom in pediatric emergency department. The causes are mostly benign without any sign on chest x-ray (CXR). However, CXR is one of the most ordered tests in this situation. Our main objective was to assess the current management of CXR by physicians in this context, according to the algorithm proposed by the French Society of Pediatrics (FSP). We conducted a retrospective study in two French pediatric emergency departments. We reviewed the medical records of children who presented with chest pain between 2018, July 1rst to 2021, July 31th. We collected data from history and clinical examination. The prescription of CXR and its interpretation were collected. Overall, 599 children were enrolled. The algorithm was followed in 57,1 % of cases, and 8,2 % of abnormal CXR were noted. On univariate analysis, medical history with a significant OR greater than 2 included cardiological history (as defined by FSP), neoplasia, pneumonia and sickle cell disease. Right lateralized pain, pain that worsens with respiration, fever and cough were also symptoms significantly associated with an abnormal CXR result. On physical finding, tachycardia, tachypnea, abnormal cardiac and pulmonary clinical examination (as defined by the FSP) were significantly associated with pathological CXR. However, the multivariate logistic regression model could not be carried out due to too many significant variables in univariate analysis, and too few number of abnormal CXR reported. CXR remains the cornerstone of chest pain management in pediatric emergencies, even though the rate of abnormal CXR appears low. The appropriateness of CXR prescribing can be improved by guidelines focusing on the clinical etiologies of chest pain visible on CXR. A similar prospective study may identify risk factors for pathological CXR and clarify the decision tree for the indication of CXR in chest pain."

    "abstract": "Anaemia is common in mothers and infants in the first year postpartum, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. We evaluated whether treating anaemia in the second trimester of pregnancy with a single dose of intravenous iron, ferric carboxymaltose, compared with standard-of-care oral iron could alleviate anaemia in postpartum women and their infants. REVAMP (ACTRN12618001268235), an open-label, individually randomised, controlled trial done across nine urban and five rural health centres in Malawi, recruited women if they were in the second trimester of singleton pregnancy, had a capillary haemoglobin concentration of less than 10·0 g/dL, and had a negative malaria rapid diagnostic test. Once enrolled, women were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive intravenous ferric carboxymaltose (20 mg/kg up to 1000 mg) or standard of care (60 mg oral elemental iron twice daily for 90 days); all women received preventive malaria treatment. The primary endpoint of REVAMP was anaemia prevalence at 36 weeks of gestation, with follow-up of mothers and infants until 1 month postpartum. In REVAMP-EXTENDED, women from REVAMP who gave consent, and their infants, were followed up at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months postpartum, and venous blood was collected for haemoglobin, ferritin, and C-reactive protein measurement. Maternal postpartum outcomes comprised prevalence of anaemia (venous haemoglobin concentration <11 g/dL up to and including delivery and <12·0 g/dL postpartum) and haemoglobin concentration, as well as iron status (iron deficiency, defined as serum ferritin <15 μg/L, or <30 μg/L if C-reactive protein >5 mg/L, and iron deficiency anaemia [both iron deficiency and anaemia]). Infant outcomes comprised cord ferritin concentration, and haemoglobin and ferritin concentrations at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months of age. Between Nov 12, 2018, and March 2, 2021, 862 women were randomly assigned in REVAMP, of whom 793 (393 in the ferric carboxymaltose group [376 liveborn infants] and 400 [379 liveborn infants] in the standard-of-care group) provided consent for REVAMP-EXTENDED. At 12 months postpartum, ferritin concentrations were higher (geometric mean ratio 1·47 [95% CI 1·29-1·66], p<0·0001), and prevalence of iron deficiency was lower (prevalence ratio 0·65 [0·48-0·88], p=0·0050), in mothers receiving ferric carboxymaltose than in those receiving standard of care. Anaemia was less common in women who received ferric carboxymaltose than in those who received standard of care at 1 month (prevalence ratio 0·84 [95% CI 0·71-0·98], p=0·027), 3 months (0·75 [0·62-0·91], p=0·0029), and 6 months (0·78 [0·63-0·96], p=0·018) postpartum but not thereafter. There was no evidence of a difference between groups regarding cord ferritin, infant ferritin, or infant haemoglobin concentrations at any timepoint. Benefits on postpartum anaemia were restricted to mothers with baseline iron deficiency. Ferric carboxymaltose treatment in the second trimester protected women from postpartum anaemia and iron deficiency but did not affect infant haematological or iron status.

We established a Quality Improvement (QI) Collaborative that aimed to improve the quality of care for all young adults with SCD by establishing a standardised SCD transition process. This study evaluates the implementation of the Six Core Elements (6CE) of Health Care Transition, which was a fundamental component of the cluster-randomised Sickle Cell Trevor Thompson Transition Project (ST3P-UP) study. A central QI team trained 14 ST3P-UP study sites on QI methodologies, 6CE and Got Transition's process measurement tool (PMT). Site-level QI teams included a transition coordinator, clinic physicians/staff, patients/parents with SCD and community representatives. Sites completed the PMT every 6 months for 54 months and monthly audits of 10 randomly-selected charts to verify readiness/self-care assessments and emergency care plans. Of a possible 100, the aggregate mean (±SD) PMT score for paediatric clinics was 23.9 (±13.8) at baseline, 95.9 (±6.0) at 24 months and 98.9 (±2.1) at 54 months. The aggregate mean PMT score for adult clinics was 15.0 (±13.5) at baseline, 88.4 (±11.8) at 24 months and 95.8 (±6.8) at 54 months. The overall QI Collaborative PMT score improved by 402%. At baseline, readiness/self-care assessments were current for 38% of paediatric and 20% of adult patients; emergency care plans were current for 20% of paediatric and 3% of adult patients. Paediatric clinics had one median readiness assessment shift (76%) and four median emergency care plan shifts (65%, 77%, 79%, 84%). Adult clinics experienced three median self-care assessment shifts (58%, 63%, 70%) and two median emergency care plan shifts (57%, 70%). The ST3P-UP QI Collaborative successfully embedded the 6CE of Health Care Transition into routine care and increased administration of assessments and emergency care plans for transition-aged patients with SCD."

Infection accounts for a significant amount of the morbidity and mortality, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, but is relatively poorly studied and characterized. Patients with SCD have significant immunodeficiency and are more likely to suffer severe and life-threatening complications of infection, and additionally infections can trigger complications of SCD itself. Those with more severe forms of SCD have functional asplenia from a very early age, which accounts for much of the morbidity in young children, particularly invasive infections from encapsulated bacteria including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Salmonella typhi and meningococcal disease. Additionally, there are other defects in immune function in SCD, associated with anemia, tissue infarction and impaired adaptive immunity. Complications of infections in SCD include acute chest syndrome, acute painful episodes, osteomyelitis, meningitis, urinary tract infections, overwhelming sepsis and death. Viral infections cause significant morbidity, particularly severe anemia associated with parvovirus, and to a lesser extent other infections such as influenza and coronavirus disease 2019. The relationship between malaria and SCD is complicated and discussed in this review. Unlike many of the genetic risk factors for poor outcomes in SCD, it is theoretically possible to modify the risks associated with infections with established public health measures. These include the provision of vaccination, prophylactic antibiotics and access to clean water and mosquito avoidance, although current financial restraints and political priorities have made this difficult."

    "abstract": "Continuous vaso-occlusive and inflammatory processes cause extensive end-organ damage in adults with sickle cell disease (SCD), and there is little evidence that long-term hydroxyurea therapy prevents this. In initial trials, P-selectin blockade with crizanlizumab reduced SCD vaso-occlusive crisis frequency, and interleukin (IL)-1β inhibition in SCD patients, using canakinumab, lowered inflammatory markers. We used murine SCD models to examine the effects of acute and chronic blockade of P-selectin and of IL-1β on vaso-occlusive events, their inflammatory profile and organ health. Both approaches improved impaired cutaneous microvascular perfusion in SCD mice by reducing TNF-α-induced vaso-occlusion. Acute P-selectin blockade markedly reduced TNF-α-induced neutrophil-platelet aggregate formation in SCD mice, and decreased leukocyte- rolling movements in the microvasculature, while acute IL-1β inhibition attenuated microvascular leukocyte adhesion. Six weeks of IL-1β-blocking immunotherapy improved the inflammatory profile of SCD mice, considerably reduced hepatic fibrosis and provided some relief from lung injury. In contrast, although P-selectin blockade reduced glomerular congestion, no significant benefit to overall organ pathology was observed. Unexpectedly, while combining the two immunotherapies reduced microvascular occlusion, their prolonged use caused acute liver injury. Notably, inhibition of IL-1β, but not of P-selectin, remarkably decreased hemosiderosis, in association with reduced tissue macrophage infiltration and the correction of biomarkers of dysregulated iron turnover. Our findings suggest that the attenuation of inflammation, as well as of vaso- occlusive processes, may be crucial for mitigating organ damage in SCD. Future trials should explore the ability of cytokine blockade to prevent multi-organ damage in patients with SCD, beyond evaluating vaso-occlusive crisis frequency."

It presents as regenerative anemia and recurrent vaso-occlusive episodes, which can impact all organs. Acute and chronic complications increase morbidity and mortality, significantly reducing life expectancy compared to the general population. Optimal and multidisciplinary management of acute events is essential to improve patients' quality of life and overall prognosis. Vaso-occlusive crises and acute chest syndrome are the two most frequent acute complications. Their treatment, described here, is threefold: analgesia, treatment of causative factors and prevention of further complications."

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease is a genetic disease with multisystem involvement. More than 300,000 children are born with sickle cell disease globally, with the majority of cases being in Sub-Saharan Africa. In Uganda, about 20,000 children are born with sickle cell disease annually, with more than three-quarters dying before the age of 5 years. Those who live beyond 5 years tend to have poor health-related quality of life, numerous complications, and recurrent hospitalizations. In developing countries, most symptomatic patients are diagnosed early in childhood. Few of those not screened in childhood tend to present in adulthood with variable symptoms. This case reports a 22-year-old African male patient of Toro tribe who presented with paroxysms of multiple joint pain associated with generalized body malaise for about 6 months. He presented as a referral from a lower facility with an unestablished cause of symptoms. Physical examination revealed conjunctival pallor, icterus, and tenderness of joints. Cell counts showed anemia and hemoglobin electrophoresis revealed 87% of sickled hemoglobin. This case report pinpoints the importance of considering the diagnosis of sickle cell disease even in adults presenting with symptoms of sickle cell disease. It also adds to the relevance of screening at all age groups, especially in high-endemic regions such as Africa and Asia."

We tested (1) if these comorbidities are associated with attention/executive functioning, processing speed and instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs), which describe complex skills that support independence, and (2) if cognitive symptoms mediate the relationship between comorbidities and IADLs. Participants (n = 2417) completed patient-reported outcome measures through the Sickle Cell Disease Implementation Consortium. Mean age of participants was 28 years and HbSS/Sβ<sup>0</sup> genotypes were prevalent (73%). Comorbidities of depression, pain frequency and disrupted sleep were associated with processing speed and attention/executive functioning (all p < 0.01) when controlling for stroke and demographics. IADLs were associated with depression, pain, sleep, attention/executive functioning, income (<$25 000) (all p < 0.001) and genotype (p = 0.0025) after controlling for covariates. The indirect effects of attention/executive functioning and processing speed were both significant (p < 0.001) in mediation models that examined pathways between comorbidities and IADLs. Attention/executive functioning accounted for 17.5% of the relationship between depression and IADLs and sleep and IADLs. Processing speed explained 10% of the relationship between sleep and IADLs and 8% of the relationship between depression and IADLs. Managing comorbidities should be prioritized to mitigate cognitive symptoms and improve complex daily living skills."

Despite normal oxygen delivery (OD), cerebral vascular reserve (CVR), and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO<sub>2</sub>) are diminished in SCD, possibly causing the formation of SCIs. Voxelotor inhibits polymerization by increasing the hemoglobin oxygen binding, ameliorating hemolytic anemia. Furthermore, anemia is related to cardiac complications. Our aims were to assess the effect of voxelotor on markers of cerebral perfusion, cerebral oxygen metabolism, and markers of cardiac stress in SCD patients. Cerebral hemodynamics and oxygen metabolism were measured with MRI before and after 3 months of voxelotor treatment (1500 mg/day) in 18 adults with SCD (HbSS/HbSβ<sup>0</sup>-thalassemia). Hemoglobin levels significantly increased (p = .001) and markers of hemolysis decreased (p < .05). OD increased from 6.5 (IQR, 6.0-7.1) mL O<sub>2</sub>/100 g/min to 8.1 (IQR, 7.2-8.7) mL O<sub>2</sub>/100 g/min (p = .001). CBF and CVR did not change.

N-terminal pro-B type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels decreased (p = .048) and maximum tricuspid regurgitation flow velocity (TRV<sub>max</sub>) normalized in all but one patient with increased TRV<sub>max</sub>. Voxelotor treatment in patients with severe SCD did not decrease CBF despite increased Hb levels. Cerebral oxygen metabolism slightly decreased, despite raised OD, most likely due to drug-induced increase in oxygen binding. Nonetheless, voxelotor improved clinically validated markers of cardiac stress."

In this report, the authors describe a case of progressive spinal AVN treated with radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and kyphoplasty for the patient's persistent lower back pain. A 38-year-old male with long-standing spinal AVN due to SCD had been managed conservatively with hydroxyurea and oral opioid analgesics for several years until breakthrough episodes of low-back pain began to occur with an inability to perform activities of daily life. The patient's condition progressed to involve multiple vertebral bodies, leading to a refractory response. Bipedicular RFA directed at L3 and L4 with kyphoplasty was proposed as a novel, minimally invasive approach. The patient was found to have lasting postoperative relief. Patients with pain attributed to a sickle cell crisis can benefit from RFA and kyphoplasty to potentially eliminate or minimize symptoms from spinal AVN due to chronic SCD not responding to conservative management. https://thejns.org/doi/10.3171/CASE24343."

    "abstract": "Hydroxycarbamide (HC) is the most widely used therapeutic for individuals with sickle cell disease (SCD, including sickle cell anemia and other forms of the disease). HC's clinical benefits are primarily associated with its ability to induce foetal haemoglobin (HbF); this limited view of HC's therapeutic potential may lead to its discontinuation when a modest amount of HbF is induced. A better understanding of the HbF-independent effects of HC on genes and pathways relevant to SCD pathophysiology is therefore needed. In this study, we performed bulk RNA-Seq on whole blood samples collected from a cohort of 25 paediatric patients with SCD to identify genes and pathways that are affected by treatment with HC. At the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of HC, patients showed altered expression levels of several genes and biological pathways. Pathways related to haeme metabolism, interferon-alpha response, and interferon-gamma response were significantly downregulated at HC MTD relative to the matched pre-HC samples. Pathways linked with IL2-STAT5 signalling and TNFα signalling via NF-Kβ were observed to be up-regulated at HC MTD. These results illustrate the range of effects exerted by HC during therapy for SCD and pave the way for an improved understanding of the HbF induction-independent benefits of HC."

    "abstract": "Although sickle cell disease (SCD)-related childhood mortality in the United States significantly improved in the 1990s, unclear is the trend in SCD-related mortality more recently given the continued disparities faced by this minoritized population. In this analysis, we aimed to (1) compare the overall and age-specific mortality rates from 1999 to 2009 vs 2010 to 2020 with a particular focus on the age of transition and (2) determine the most common causes of death for the US SCD population for 2010 to 2020. We analyzed publicly available data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention WONDER database, a compilation of national-level mortality statistics from 1979 to 2020 derived from death certificates compiled by the National Center for Health Statistics. We searched by all individuals of all ethnicities, sexes, and ages using the underlying cause of death. The crude mortality rate for individuals with SCD for 2010 to 2020 was 1.6 per 1 000 000 individuals, which was significantly lower than the period 1999 to 2009 (crude rate 1.7 per 1 000 000, P < .0001). In addition, the mean age at mortality of those with SCD was older in 2010 to 2020 (43 years) versus 1999 to 2009 (39 years). However, there remains a significant increase in mortality rate in the 20 to 24 year age group versus 15 to 19 years (1.7 per 1 000 000 versus 0.7 per 1 000 000, P < .0001), corresponding with the age of transition from pediatric to adult centers. In addition, 39% of underlying causes of death were not caused by SCD, but rather primarily chronic conditions, including cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, malignancy, and renal disease. The study has several limitations mostly because of the imperfections of administrative data sources, including inaccuracies in diagnoses codes, risking over or undercounting. Although the US SCD-related mortality rate continues to decrease, the age of transition to adult care is a particularly vulnerable time in the lives of this marginalized group. Innovative and expanded approaches to care are greatly needed."

    "abstract": "β-thalassemia and sickle cell disease are among the most prevalent genetic blood disorders globally. These conditions arise from mutations in the β-globin gene, leading to defective hemoglobin production and resulting in anemia. Current treatments include γ-globin inducers (eg, Hydroxyurea), blood transfusions, iron chelation therapy, and bone marrow transplantation. Recently approved disease-modifying agents and promising gene therapies offer hope, yet their broad application is constrained by scalability challenges. Traditionally, research and development for β-globinopathies have focused on γ-globin induction. However, the ε-globin variant, which is active during early embryonic development and subsequently silenced prenatally, was once considered noninducible by postnatal pharmacological means. Recent studies indicate that, akin to γ-globin, enhancing ε-globin expression could compensate for impaired β-globin synthesis, potentially ameliorating the clinical manifestations of β-globinopathies. This review critically examines the viability of ε-globin induction as a therapeutic strategy for β-thalassemia and sickle cell diseases. It also delves into the burgeoning research on the mechanisms governing ε-globin silencing and its pharmacological reactivation. We conclude with a discussion of prospective research directions and drug development initiatives aimed at exploiting ε-globin's therapeutic promise."

The aim of this study is to investigate the prevalence and predictors of sickle cell nephropathy (SCN) in the Saudi population. A retrospective study was conducted from April to October 2023, and included 343 adult patients with SCD who were recruited from the hereditary blood diseases center (HBDC), Al-Ahsa, Saudi Arabia. Spot protein-to-creatinine ratio was measured and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was estimated from serum creatinine using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation. As per KIDGO guidelines, CKD was diagnosed in 93 (27.1%) patients. Based on the CKD-EPI equation, 2% of patients had low GFR (eGFR < 60mL/min), 28.3% had high GFR (eGFR > 140 mL/min), and 69.7% had normal GFR. Among SCD patients, proteinuria was observed in 26.5% of the patients. SCD patients with CKD were significantly older than non-CKD patients (p < 0.001) and had higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) and hypertension (HTN) (p = 0.045 and 0.001 respectively). The multivariate analysis showed that age (P = 0.001; OR 1.035; 95% CI 1.014-1.056) and low hemoglobin level (p = 0.034; OR -0.851; 95% CI 0.721-0.980) were independent risk factors for the development of SCN. Nephropathy is a common complication among patients with SCD as early as the third decade of life, although they remain asymptomatic. Advances in age and low hemoglobin levels are the main predictors of nephropathy. In addition, SCD patients with coexistent comorbidities, particularly DM and HTN, were at increased risk of developing kidney disease."

Vascular shunting was assessed in each patient using a previously published ordinal venous hyperintensity score (VHS) of 0, 1, or 2 on cerebral blood flow-weighted MRI. Participants with VHS of 2, indicative of the most rapid arteriovenous transit, had significantly reduced blood oxygen content (CaO2; 10.90 ± 1.69 mL O2/100 mL blood), oxygen extraction fraction (OEF; 33.52% ± 5.54%), and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen consumption (CMRO2; 2.91 ± 0.69 mL O2/100 g tissue per minute) compared with their counterparts with VHS = 0 (CaO2 = 12.42 ± 1.58 mL O2/100 mL blood; OEF = 39.03% ± 3.80%; CMRO2 = 3.77 ± 0.84 mL O2/100 g tissue per minute) or VHS = 1 (CaO2 = 11.86 ± 1.73 mL O2/100 mL blood; OEF = 36.37% ± 5.11%; CMRO2 = 3.59 ± 0.78 mL O2/100 g tissue per minute). Both pediatric and adult patients with SCD presenting with greater imaging evidence of vascular shunting had mildly reduced OEF and CMRO2. These findings highlight that imaging markers of vascular shunting are associated with significant, albeit mild, evidence of reduced OEF and CMRO2 in patients with SCD."

In atherosclerotic carotid disease, previous studies demonstrated elevated oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) as a predictor of ipsilateral stroke. In a SCD cohort, we examined hemispheric hemodynamic and oxygen metabolic dysfunction as tissue-based biomarkers of cerebral ischemic risk in patients with LVV. Children and adults with SCD were recruited from a SCD clinic associated with a tertiary medical center and underwent prospective brain MRI and MR angiography. LVV was defined as ≥75% stenosis in a major anterior circulation artery, excluding occlusion or previous revascularization surgery. Baseline characteristics, cerebral blood flow (CBF), normalized OEF (nOEF), infarct volume, white matter microstructure, and brain volume were compared in hemispheres with vs without LVV. In a cross-sectional analysis, mixed-effects linear multivariable models examined the effect of LVV on: (1) CBF and nOEF, as tissue markers of hemodynamic and oxygen metabolic stress, respectively, and (2) endpoints of cerebral ischemic injury including infarct volume, white matter microstructure, and brain volume. Of 155 patients (22 [12-31] years, 57% female), 33 (21%) had ≥25% stenosis, 22 (14%) had ≥50% stenosis, 14 (9%) had 75%-99% stenosis, and 5 (3%) had 100% occlusion. After excluding hemispheres with previous revascularization surgery, LVV was present in 16 hemispheres from 11 patients. Hemispheres with (N = 16) vs without (N = 283) LVV had lower CBF (25.2 vs 32.1 mL/100 g/min, <i>p</i> = 0.01) and higher nOEF (0.99 vs 0.95, <i>p</i> = 0.02). On multivariable analysis, CBF was nonsignificantly lower (β = -0.16, <i>p</i> = 0.07) while nOEF remained higher in hemispheres with LVV (β = 0.04, <i>p</i> = 0.03). Moreover, LVV was associated with greater hemispheric infarct volume, microstructural disruption, and atrophy. Beyond greater infarct burden, LVV was associated with hemispheric atrophy and white matter microstructural injury. As an indicator of active hypoxia, elevated nOEF likely represents a compensatory response to flow-limiting stenosis in hemispheres with LVV. The study is limited by a small number of patients with severe stenosis. Future studies are needed to evaluate the potential of tissue-based CBF and nOEF in assessing stroke risk and guide timely treatment of vasculopathy in SCD."

Cellular senescence, measured by expression of p16<sup>INK4a</sup> in peripheral T-lymphocytes, is recognized as one of the underlying contributors to organismal aging. To examine if cellular senescence is increased in SCD patients, we cross-sectionally measured and compared expression of p16 mRNA in peripheral blood T lymphocytes in 18 adolescents and young adults with SCD to 27 similarly aged individuals without SCD. Expression of p16 was dramatically higher in individuals with SCD vs. without SCD (10.1 vs. 8.7 log<sub>2</sub> p16 units, respectively, <i>p</i> < 0.001) - a gap of 43 years in biological age - consistent with accelerated aging in the SCD population. Race was not associated with the increased p16 expression in the SCD group. These initial results suggest that individuals with SCD have a significantly higher cellular senescence burden which may contribute to premature aging, physiological decline, and excess morbidities. Additional longitudinal assessment and consideration for trials of senolytic therapies among individuals living with SCD and high p16 expression are warranted to improve their health span."

    "abstract": "Invasive non-typhoidal <i>Salmonella</i> (iNTS) disease continues to be a major public health problem, especially in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), where incidence rates are 227 cases [range 152-341] per 100,000 populations. Populations at risk of iNTS include adults with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, malnourished children, and those with recent malaria or sickle-cell anaemia (SCA). In Kenya, iNTS disease is particularly a major challenge in poor informal settlements, with infants and young children less than 5 years of age being the most affected. Our study aimed to investigate the association between sickle cell disease, malaria, and HIV in multi-drug-resistant invasive non-typhoidal <i>Salmonella</i> from outpatient and hospitalised children ≤16 years in informal settlements in Nairobi County, Kenya. This study recruited 16,679 children aged ≤16 years who presented with salmonellosis symptoms for a period of 6 years (2013-2018). The patients were age-matched with controls (asymptomatic individuals). The study was conducted at 3 outpatient sites and 1 inpatient site; the outpatient sites were all located within the Mukuru informal settlement. The inpatient site was Mbagathi district hospital, which serves patients residing in Kibera informal settlement. Blood and stool samples from children with fever ≥38°C and/or diarrhea and stool samples alone from controls were collected for processing for the presence of iNTS using basic microbiology procedures including culture, serology, and Kirby Bauer disc diffusion for sensitivity testing. Dry blood spots were also taken and processed for sickle cell protein markers using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). HIV and malaria tests were also conducted using rapid tests, respectively. From the total of 22,246 blood and stool samples tested, 741 (3.3%) tested positive for <i>Salmonella</i> species. A total of 338 (45.6%) iNTS were isolated across all 4 sites; these consisted of 158 (21.3%) <i>Salmonella</i> Enteritidis and 180 (24.3%) <i>Salmonella</i> Typhimurium. The most common resistance phenotype was against ampicillin, chloramphenicol, and sulfamethoxazole trimethoprim. A total of 118 (34.9%) isolates were multidrug-resistant (MDR). Out of 2,684 dry blood samples subjected to HPLC for investigation of sickle cell disease traits, 1820 (67.8%) had normal haemoglobin (Hb AA/Hb AF); 162/2684 (6%) tested positive for sickle cell traits (Hb AS/Hb AFS). Some patients positive for iNTS were also found to have other co-morbidities; 4 (0.1%) tested positive for sickle cell disease (Hb FS), malaria, and HIV 8 (2.4%) and 5 (1.5%), respectively. The high prevalence of MDR iNTS isolates and emerging resistance to third-generation cephalosporins is of great concern, as they are the recommended drugs for the management of iNTS in our settings. Sickle cell disease, malaria, and HIV were all not major factors associated with iNTS disease among children in Mukuru and Kibera informal settlements."

    "abstract": "The translational gap from the discovery of evidence-based solutions to their implementation in healthcare delivery organizations derives from an incorrect assumption that the need for change among executive, administrative, or clinical personnel is the same as the demand for change. For sickle cell disease (SCD), implementation of evidence-based guidelines is often delayed or obstructed due to lack of demand. This challenge allows for the persistence of resource limitations and care delivery models that do not meet the community's unique needs. Agile Storytelling is a process built on the scientific foundations of behavioral economics, complexity science, and network science to create local demand for the implementation of evidence-based solutions. Agile Storytelling includes a design phase and a testing phase. The design phase converts the evidence-based solution into a minimally viable story of a hero, a villain, struggle, drama, and a resolution. The testing phase evaluates the effectiveness of the story via a series of storytelling sprints in the target local healthcare delivery organization. The efficacy of Agile Storytelling was tested in an iterative <i>n</i>-of-1 case study design. Agile Storytelling was used in a large, urban, healthcare system within the United States to facilitate implementation of national SCD best-practice guidelines. After repeated failures attempting to use national and local data regarding the high societal need to hire a SCD-specific social worker, an Agile change conductor using Agile Storytelling was able to create demand for the new position within a week. This decision has ultimately improved patient outcomes and led to the adoption of a specialized collaborative care team for SCD within the health network. Agile Storytelling can lead to structured, effective, and informed storytelling to create local demand within healthcare delivery organizations."

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) patients encounter various complications, such as acute splenic sequestration crisis and hypersplenism that may require splenectomy. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to clarify differences between total splenectomy (TS) or partial splenectomy (PS) in terms of hematological and postoperative outcomes. We identified studies involving SCD patients who underwent PS or TS, whether open or laparoscopic, and whose hematological and operative outcomes were evaluated, through searching PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Embase and Cochrane databases from inception until June 2024. hemoglobin concentration and reticulocytes %. operative blood transfusion need, length of hospital stay (LoS), postoperative infections, overwhelming postsplenectomy sepsis (OPSS), acute chest syndrome (ACS), thromboembolic events and mortality. Eighteen studies were included; 17 cohort and one case series. Seven studies collected data from the same SICHA institutions, so a total of 756 SCD patients is included. According to the most recent study, no significant changes in hemoglobin (preoperative 10.5 ± 0.3 vs 9.6 ± 0.4 one year postoperative in 24 PS cases, and 9.7 ± 0.1 vs 9.7 ± 0.2 in 73 TS cases), however, both TS and PS significantly decreased reticulocyte by 2 % (0.8-3.2 %). Proportional analysis of short-term infection revealed a lower incidence in TS 2.71 % vs 8.64 % in PS, and similarly for ACS, it is 6.97 % in TS vs 14.90 % in PS. This first systematic review and meta-analysis shows that TS and PS have no or minimal effect on hemoglobin but a strong lowering effect on reticulocyte %. Proportional analysis reveals lower short-term infections and ACS following TS than PS. However, further clinical trials are necessary to draw definite conclusions and improve surgical decision making. Systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies. II."

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a prevalent, life-threatening condition with few treatment options, attributed to a heritable mutation in β-hemoglobin. Therapeutic induction of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) with small molecules has been pursued as a treatment to ameliorate many disease complications but with limited success. Herein, we report the discovery of <b>10</b>, a novel, potent, and selective molecular glue degrader of the transcription factor WIZ that robustly induces HbF expression as a potential treatment for SCD. <b>10</b> was optimized from a phenotypic screening hit utilizing insights from X-ray crystallography and computational modeling to improve potency, selectivity and <i>in vivo</i> exposure. In an hNBSGW mouse xenograft model, <b>10</b> demonstrated robust WIZ degradation and HbF induction. These results highlight the potential of WIZ degraders as a promising therapy for sickle cell disease."

    "abstract": "Gene therapies delivered through a single administration have revolutionized treatment possibilities for many patients living with serious or fatal conditions such as spinal muscular atrophy, hemophilia and sickle cell disease. However, shadowing the excitement about the transformational potential of many gene therapies has been widespread concern about the combination of uncertainty in the durability of their benefits over the long term and the short-term financial shock of high prices. As the healthcare payment ecosystem prepares for the growing number of gene therapies entering the market, three key interconnected challenges must be addressed: determining a fair price, managing clinical uncertainty and managing short-term budget impacts. This paper identifies specific policy reforms and market-based tools to help the US health system address these challenges to achieve more equitable and affordable access for patients to the growing number of gene therapies expected to be approved in the coming years."

However, it is not yet studied for non-firearm arrest-related death (NF-ARD). With extensive multi-pronged searches, a large database (n = 1389) of NF-ARDs was established. For the years 2006-2021 (inclusive) there were 50 NF-ARDs of Black persons in which postmortem evidence of SCT was found. A control cohort consisted of 414 NF-ARDs of Black persons with no reported SCT. The mean age for SCT cases was 33.1 ± 10.4 years versus 37.0 ± 10.4 years for the control group (p = 0.01). The body-mass index for SCT cases was 28.3 ± 6.6 kg/m<sup>2</sup> versus 30.7 ± 7.6 kg/m<sup>2</sup> for the control group (p = 0.03). The prevalence of cardiomegaly was 21% for SCT cases versus 39% in the control cohort (p = 0.008). The postmortem prevalence of SCT in NF-ARDs of Black persons (n = 50, 10.7%) was higher than the prevalence of SCT in the US Black population, which is 7.1% (p = 0.003). In this study of NF-ARDs in Black persons, the prevalence of SCT and the differences between the SCT cases and the control cohort suggest that exertional collapse associated with sickle cell trait may be a contributory factor in NF-ARDs."

This study aimed to systematically assess the prevalence of anemia among Sudanese children. We conducted a comprehensive literature search in August 2021 and updated it in December 2022 to identify studies on anemia among Sudanese children. We searched databases including PubMed, Scopus, Science Direct, and Google Scholar. Studies eligible for inclusion in this systematic review and meta-analysis (SRMA) reported data to calculate anemia prevalence in children using WHO criteria. We performed meta-analysis using R software with metaprop and metafor packages. Using a random effects model, we estimated the pooled prevalence of anemia among 8006 Sudanese children to be 53.5% (95% CI, 36.6-70.4%). Subgroup analysis revealed that 62.7% of the children had unclassified anemia, 39.1% had iron deficiency anemia, and 8.7% had sickle cell anemia. Over a 21-year period, childhood anemia in Sudan showed an increasing trend, rising from 40.7% (1999-2009) to 55.1% (2010-2015) and 58.1% (2016-2020). The findings indicate a significantly higher prevalence of anemia among Sudanese children compared to many other countries, highlighting the need for proactive measures to prevent and control anemia in this population."

Hydroxyurea presented toxic effects on meristematic <i>Allium cepa</i> cells, causing chromosomal abnormalities and reduction of mitotic index, killed HCT-116 colorectal carcinoma cells and induced DNA injuries upon mice cells (hepatocytes, bone marrow leukocytes and PBMC). Simultaneously, hydroxyurea decreased levels of CAT and GSH activities and expand lipid peroxidation. All these biochemical and physiological changes were ameliorated when associated with ascorbic acid, indicating it restored antioxidant enzymes, decreased MDA levels, removed peroxides and, consequently, presented cytoprotection against HU-provoked cellular damage in normal cells.

This study aimed to determine the clinical utility of caregiver signaling questions for detecting significant neurocognitive impairment (defined as >1.5 standard deviation [SD] below the normative mean on ≥2 measures) and domain-specific impairment (defined as >1.5 SD below the normative mean) in children and adolescents with SCD. A total of 421 caregivers of children with SCD aged 8 to 17 years (62% hemoglobin SS (HbSS) or hemoglobin S-beta zero (HbSβ0) thalassemia) were asked 7 signaling questions. Children completed performance-based neurocognitive and academic measures. Children who were reported to have repeated a grade, did not obtain primarily A/B grades in school, had a history of learning difficulties, or whose caregiver reported concern for their learning were more likely to have significant neurocognitive impairment and obtained lower scores across all measures (all q < 0.05). History of learning difficulties emerged as the most sensitive and specific signaling question for detecting significant neurocognitive impairment (sensitivity, 0.64; specificity, 0.77) and domain-specific impairment (sensitivity range, 0.56-0.77; specificity range, 0.63-0.72). Cumulative caregiver report improved prediction of neurocognitive impairment beyond demographic/clinical factors alone. Although performance-based screening for all patients with SCD is the most effective means to identify those with neurocognitive or academic impairment, use of caregiver signaling questions represents a brief and low-cost method to improve the detection of patients with SCD in need of support."

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) complications, such as sickle cell nephropathy (SCN), may begin in childhood and progress insidiously to chronic kidney disease in adulthood. In Saudi Arabia (SA), there is a lack of studies evaluating kidney function in children with SCD. This study aims to assess microalbuminuria (MA) as an early marker of renal dysfunction in SCD children living in the Eastern region of SA, to potentially institute appropriate early treatment. A prospective cross-sectional study was conducted on 114 Saudi children with SCD under the age of 14 years who attended the pediatric hematology clinic for routine follow-up. Demographic and clinical information were collected from the patients and their parents, who provided informed consent. Morning urine samples were collected and tested for the presence of MA using the urinary albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR). Blood samples were also collected for basic laboratory investigations. The prevalence of MA and its correlation with various clinical and laboratory data were analyzed. Additionally, a comparison of clinical characteristics and MA was conducted between children originating from the Southwestern (SW) and Eastern regions of the country, all of whom lived in the Eastern Province. A total of 114 children with SCD were included in the study. The mean age was 8.8 ± 3.2 years, with a male-to-female ratio of 1.3:1. Based on their region of origin, they were divided into two groups: Eastern (n = 26/114) and SW (n = 88/114). MA was detected in 28 patients (24.6%), with no significant difference in prevalence between the two groups. There was no significant statistical difference in clinical and laboratory data between the groups, except for hemoglobin F (HBF) levels and the use of hydroxyurea (HU). HBF levels were significantly higher in children from the Eastern region, while more SW patients used HU. No correlation was found between MA and any of the studied variables. MA is common in children with SCD in the Eastern region of SA, with no difference in its prevalence between children of the two different ancestries carrying the Arab-Indian (AI) and African haplotypes. It is not associated with any of the studied clinical variables in this report. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings."

All the participants underwent ultrasound and color Doppler examination, and the pulsatility index and resistive index values of the main renal artery, segmental artery, and interlobar artery in both kidneys were recorded and compared. The Doppler measurements of the main renal artery, segmental artery, and interlobar artery were compared between the control and sickle cell disease groups. It was found that both pulsatility index and resistive index were significantly higher in the sickle cell disease group, as compared to the control group, for the main renal artery, segmental artery, and interlobar artery (<i>p</i> <0.0001, <i>p</i> <0.0001, and <i>p</i> <0.0001, respectively).

In patients with sickle cell disease, the diagnosis is even more difficult due to the occurrence of Vaso occlusive crisis which being the most common acute clinical manifestation of sickle cell disease in bone may mimic osteomyelitis. No single clinical presentation, laboratory result, or imaging finding can definitively distinguish these diagnoses. A 15-year-old female presented to the outpatient department with mild pain and swelling in both forearms persisting for the past 3 months. Radiographs revealed predominantly diaphyseal expansile osteolytic lesions in the bilateral distal third radius with periosteal reaction along with a small radiolucent area in the right distal radius. She was subsequently admitted for further assessment. On the 3rd day of admission, pus pointing was noted on the volar aspect of the right forearm while the left side only had bony swelling. Surgical intervention (debridement with saucerization) was performed on both sides. Pus culture (collected intraoperatively) showed Serratia marcescens as the causative organism. Culture-sensitive antibiotics were administered intravenously for 3 weeks followed by oral antibiotics for 3 weeks. At 1-year follow-up near complete resolution of bony lesions with full range of motion in both upper limbs was noted. Subacute osteomyelitis may present with just bony swelling without significant pain or fever and can present a diagnostic dilemma, a high index of suspicion is important to rule out other conditions and diagnose osteomyelitis in such cases. Unusual organisms like Serratia can cause osteomyelitis in immunodeficient patients like those with sickle cell disease. Appropriate management in the form of thorough surgical debridement, saucerization, and appropriate antibiotics can lead to complete resolution of the infection with good clinical results."

We present an updated systematic literature review to inform evidence-based guidelines on RBC matching. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) tool was used to develop recommendations. Six new observational studies (4 prospective, 2 retrospective) were identified. The six studies reported on 583 patients in total, including cross-over designs, with sample sizes from 10 to 343. Studies were heterogeneous, utilising varying degrees of RBC matching and different definitions for 'extended' matching. All reported on alloimmunisation. One study reported on molecular matching. The reported prevalence of alloimmunisation using limited matching was 0%-50% and with extended matching was 0%-24%. Eighty-two patients were alloimmunised before study entry. The risk of bias across studies was moderate to critical. The guideline panel recommends that ABO, RhDCcEe, and K-compatible RBCs are selected for individuals with SCD and thalassaemia, even in the absence of alloantibodies, and that RBCs which are antigen-negative to already existing clinically significant antibodies are chosen. There is a need for comparative research to define the benefit, impact, cost-effectiveness, and feasibility of extended RBC matching strategies to prevent alloimmunisation."

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease is ameliorated and perhaps can be 'cured' if enough fetal hemoglobin is present in most erythrocytes. Hydroxyurea, which increases fetal hemoglobin levels, is widely available and effective, especially in children. Nevertheless, only cell-based gene therapy can achieve a 'curative' fetal hemoglobin threshold. We cover the path to modulating fetal hemoglobin gene expression and the use of CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing as a viable clinical modality for treating severe sickle cell disease relying on references obtained from PubMed. Mobilized autologous hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells are engineered with vectors that derepress genes that regulate fetal hemoglobin gene expression. Following myeloablative conditioning, gene-edited cells are reinfused, engrafted, and make large amounts of fetal hemoglobin. Within months, fetal hemoglobin forms more than 40% of the total hemoglobin and hemoglobin levels normalize; symptoms of sickle cell disease disappear. Optimistically, these patients are 'cured,' but long term follow-up is needed. Although approved by regulatory agencies and highly efficacious, because of its technical imperatives and cost, this first gene editing therapeutic will be unavailable to most people with severe sickle cell disease. It is highly likely that improved methods of genomic editing will simplify gene therapy, reduce its costs, and lead to its wider applicability."

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is characterized by chronic hemolytic anemia and intermittent vasoocclusive crises. To date, 4 disease-modifying drugs have been approved for the treatment of SCD: hydroxyurea (an S-phase inhibitor), L-glutamine (an amino acid), crizanlizumab (a P-selectin inhibitor), and voxelotor (a hemoglobin S polymerization inhibitor). Preclinical studies suggested that voxelotor effectively treats SCD and sickle cell anemia (SCA). In a phase III trial, voxelotor-treated patients showed significantly elevated hemoglobin levels (>1 g/dL from baseline) compared to placebo-treated patients. The group that received voxelotor also showed a greater decrease in hemolytic markers but a comparable incidence of side effects. Six ongoing clinical trials also sought to ascertain the effectiveness and safety of high-dose voxelotor when administered to children younger than 12 years. Studies assessing their long-term efficacy and safety are needed to fully understand the role of voxelotor in treating SCD/SCA. In this review, we discuss the mechanisms, trials to date, and future treatment directions of voxelotor."

However, little is known about how parents negotiate the financial challenges facing parents of a child with sickle cell disease. This study explores the financial difficulties of parents and children living with sickle cell disease. The study adopted a qualitative approach. Twenty-seven parents were purposively selected from a sickle cell clinic in Accra, Ghana. Data collection was through an in-depth, face-to-face interview, using an interview guide based on the research objectives, and analyzed using thematic analysis. The findings showed that parents faced multiple financial difficulties (both direct and indirect) as they met the direct cost of medications, routine laboratory investigations, and hospital admissions. The National Health Insurance scheme does not wholly cover these costs. Families also describe more indirect costs, such as those associated with maintaining their child's well-being alongside those connected to their caring responsibilities, including the impact of giving up work and reducing working hours. Findings highlight the most pressing challenge, including the lack of access to financial support and a more general lack of understanding of the difficulties they faced on the part of policymakers. Supporting sickle cell parents' financial needs would improve their emotional and social well-being, enabling them to be more effective family carers."

    "abstract": "This study aims to understand the role of alternative pricing and financing mechanisms on the budget impact for payers and the risks and returns of manufacturers for gene therapies. This article uses fundamental economic principles to interpret the implications of alternative pricing mechanisms in terms of the share of value appropriated by the manufacturer and how alternative financing mechanisms alter it. It demonstrates these concepts by studying the financial impacts for a payer and the manufacturer across alternative pricing and financing mechanisms that could be used by the US Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to pay for gene therapy for sickle cell disease. Unlike value-based and manufacturer-set monopoly prices, an effective monopoly price can be derived to guarantee monopoly profits for manufacturers during their exclusivity period, thereby providing a high appropriation share and substantially lowering price and budget impact for a payer. For sickle cell disease gene therapy, the 10-year budget impact for the US Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services would range from US dollar $8.6 billion to $12.8 billion under a value-based price, to $10.2 billion to $15.2 billion under a monopoly price, but reduce to $7.7 billion under an effective monopoly price. The latter price would still fetch over 50% of the total surplus to the manufacturer while mitigating their risk of sales volume. Significant budget impacts for funding gene therapy are not mitigated across alternative financing mechanisms at any given price. The price determines most of the budget impact. The option of a patent buyout may help negotiate down prices to effective monopoly prices."

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) carries a significant risk for poor vascular health and vascular dysfunction. High levels of vascular reactive oxygen species (ROS) as well as elevated plasma endothelin-1 (ET-1), a potent vasoconstrictor with actions via the ETA receptor, are both common phenotypes in SCD. Alpha-1 adrenergic receptor activation is a major mediator of stress-induced vasoconstriction. However, the mechanism of the SCD enhanced vasoconstrictive response is unknown. We hypothesized that SCD induces enhanced alpha-1 adrenergic mediated vasoconstriction through the ET-1/ETA receptor pathway in arterial tissues. Utilizing humanized SCD (HbSS) and genetic control (HbAA) mice, alpha-1a, but not alpha-1b or alpha-1d, receptor expression was significantly greater in aortic tissue from HbSS mice compared to HbAA mice. Significantly enhanced vasoconstriction in aortic and carotid arterial segments were observed from HbSS mice compared with HbAA mice. Treatment with ambrisentan, a selective ETA receptor antagonist, and a ROS scavenger normalized the aortic vasoconstrictive response in HbSS mice. In a randomized translational study, patients with SCD were treated with placebo or ambrisentan for 3 months, with the treatment group showing an increase in the percent brachial arterial diameter. Taken together, these data suggest that the ETA receptor pathway interaction with the adrenergic receptor pathway contributes to enhanced aortic vasoconstriction in SCD. Findings indicate the potential of ETA antagonism as a therapeutic avenue for improving vascular health in SCD."

Given the association of experiences of racism and discrimination with health outcomes, this study also explored how such experiences for patients with SCD impact their interactions with clinicians and health-care systems. This mixed methods study recruited patients (aged ≥18 years) in a sickle cell treatment program; all self-identified as Black or African American. Key informant interviews evaluated a chronic pain program curriculum and rated the curriculum sessions' importance for SCD pain management. A survey containing six validated instruments then measured experiences of pain and discrimination, level of emotional expressivity, and trust in physicians and health insurers. Of the 19 adult patients approached, 12 (63%) completed the interview and survey. Interview data analysis resulted in five themes comprising pain, treatment, mental/emotional, health-care clinicians, and differences in SCD versus other chronic conditions. Each curriculum session was rated as \"very important\" or \"important\" by participants. Most described at least one experience of racism or discrimination in the medical setting and identified clinicians' lack of knowledge as a barrier to appropriate SCD care. Participants identified the importance of non-pharmacological treatments for SCD pain and appropriately managing pain caused by comorbid chronic conditions. Conversely, survey responses reported moderate levels of pain, infrequent discriminatory experiences in the medical setting, and moderate trust in medical professionals, whereas most reported experiences of discrimination in general settings. Many participants reported they either accepted it or did nothing in response to discriminatory experiences. Study findings emphasize the need to address experiences of racism and stigma in addition to experiences of emotional and physical pain among patients with SCD in the context of pain management. Findings from this study will inform the development of a SCD pain group curriculum for adult patients."

    "abstract": "Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) remains the sole well-established curative option for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). Nonmyeloablative conditioning has been used to improve outcomes and reduce toxicities in adult SCD patients. However, recipient-donor ABO incompatibility and alloimmunization may be significant impediments to successful outcomes of HSCT in SCD patients owing to risks of hemolysis, delayed engraftment, poor graft function, and graft failure (GF). Here we report our experience with allogeneic HCT for SCD and the effects of RBC group mismatch and alloimmunization on the outcome of transplant recipients. We conducted a retrospective analysis of all SCD patients age >14 years who underwent HCT between January 2015 and February 2022 at our center. All patients received i.v. alemtuzumab (1 mg/kg divided over 5 days on days -7 to -3) and 300 cGy total body irradiation on day -2 or -1 for conditioning. Pretransplantation preparation consisted of hydroxyurea at the maximum tolerated dose for 2 to 3 months and 1 session of exchange transfusion. Peripherally mobilized CD34 stem cells targeting 10 × 10<sup>6</sup> /kg of recipient weight were used. For graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis, sirolimus was started on day -1 and continued for 1 year with tapering if lymphoid chimerism was >50%. For patients with major ABO incompatibility, we administered 2 doses of rituximab (375 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) and 3 sessions of plasmapheresis before starting the conditioning regimen, targeting an isohemagglutinin titer <1/32. The primary objective was to determine the impact of RBC group mismatch and alloimmunization on the outcomes of the HCT recipients. The secondary objective was to assess the impact of GF on overall survival (OS). Logistic regression was done to evaluate predictors for GF. The Kaplan-Meier method was used for survival analysis. A total of 194 patients were included, with a median age of 26 years. Their median baseline hemoglobin and hemoglobin S values were 93 g/L and 71.3%, respectively. Indications for HCT included recurrent vaso-occlusive crisis in 52.5% of the patients, central nervous system events in 19.6%, and acute chest syndrome in 17%. After a median follow-up of 28.8 months (range, 5 to 83 months), 16 patients (8%) experienced GF (3 with primary GF and 13 with secondary GF). On univariate analysis, ABO minor incompatibility and RBC alloantibodies against donor non-ABO antigens were predictive of GF. On multivariate analysis, RBC alloantibodies against donor non-ABO antigens (odds ratio, 8.29; 95% confidence interval, 2.01 to 34.05; P = .0033) was the sole factor predictive of GF. None of the 16 patients with major ABO incompatibility developed GF. The 2-year OS for all patients was 95%. The 2-year OS was 98% in patients without GF, compared to 74% in patients with GF (P < .0001). In our SCD patients who underwent HSCT, the presence of RBC alloantibodies against donor non-ABO antigens was an independent risk factor for GF. Patients with GF had inferior survival, and strategies for decreasing the risk of GF are needed."

    "title": "Functional Foods in Preventing Human Blood Platelet Hyperactivity-Mediated Diseases-An Updated Review.",
    "abstract": "Backgrounds/Objectives: Abnormal platelet functions are associated with human morbidity and mortality. Platelets have emerged as critical regulators of numerous physiological and pathological processes beyond their established roles in hemostasis and thrombosis. Maintaining physiological platelet function is essential to hemostasis and preventing platelet-associated diseases such as cardiovascular disease, cancer metastasis, immune disorders, hypertension, diabetes, sickle cell disease, inflammatory bowel disease, sepsis, rheumatoid arthritis, myeloproliferative disease, and Alzheimer's disease. Platelets become hyperactive in obesity, diabetes, a sedentary lifestyle, hypertension, pollution, and smokers. Platelets, upon activation, can trawl leukocytes and progenitor cells to the vascular sites. Platelets release various proinflammatory, anti-inflammatory, and angiogenic factors and shed microparticles in the circulation, thus promoting pathological reactions. These platelet-released factors also maintain sustained activation, further impacting these disease processes. Although the mechanisms are unknown, multiple stimuli induce platelet hyperreactivity but involve the early pathways of platelet activation. The exact mechanisms of how hyperactive platelets contribute to these diseases are still unclear, and antiplatelet strategies are inevitable for preventing these diseases. Reducing platelet function during the early stages could significantly impact these diseases. However, while this is potentially a worthwhile intervention, using antiplatelet drugs to limit platelet function in apparently healthy individuals without cardiovascular disease is not recommended due to the increased risk of internal bleeding, resistance, and other side effects. The challenge for therapeutic intervention in these diseases is identifying factors that preferentially block specific targets involved in platelets' complex contribution to these diseases while leaving their hemostatic function at least partially intact. Since antiplatelet drugs such as aspirin are not recommended as primary preventives, it is essential to use alternative safe platelet inhibitors without side effects. A systematic search of the PUBMED database from 2000 to 2023 was conducted using the selected keywords: \"functional foods\", \"polyphenols\", \"fatty acids\", \"herbs\", fruits and vegetables\", \"cardioprotective agents\", \"plant\", \"platelet aggregation\", \"platelet activation\", \"clinical and non-clinical trial\", \"randomized\", and \"controlled\". Potent natural antiplatelet factors have been described, including omega-3 fatty acids, polyphenols, and other phytochemicals. Antiplatelet bioactive compounds in food that can prevent platelet hyperactivity and thus may prevent several platelet-mediated diseases, including cardiovascular disease. This narrative review describes the work during 2000-2023 in developing functional foods from natural sources with antiplatelet effects."

    "title": "Whole Blood Transcriptome Analysis in Congenital Anemia Patients.",
    "abstract": "Congenital anemias include a broad range of disorders marked by inherent abnormalities in red blood cells. These abnormalities include enzymatic, membrane, and congenital defects in erythropoiesis, as well as hemoglobinopathies such as sickle cell disease and thalassemia. These conditions range in presentation from asymptomatic cases to those requiring frequent blood transfusions, exhibiting phenotypic heterogeneity and different degrees of severity. Despite understanding their different etiologies, all of them have a common pathophysiological origin with congenital defects of erythropoiesis. We can find different types, from congenital sideroblastic anemia (CSA), which is a bone marrow failure anemia, to hemoglobinopathies as sickle cell disease and thalassemia, with a higher prevalence and clinical impact. Recent efforts have focused on understanding erythropoiesis dysfunction in these anemias but, so far, deep gene sequencing analysis comparing all of them has not been performed. Our study used Quant 3' mRNA-Sequencing to compare transcriptomic profiles of four sickle cell disease patients, ten thalassemia patients, and one rare case of SLC25A38 CSA. Our results showed clear differentiated gene map expressions in all of them with respect to healthy controls. Our study reveals that genes related to metabolic processes, membrane genes, and erythropoiesis are upregulated with respect to healthy controls in all pathologies studied except in the SLC25A38 CSA patient, who shows a unique gene expression pattern compared to the rest of the congenital anemias studied. Our analysis is the first that compares gene expression patterns across different congenital anemias to provide a broad spectrum of genes that could have clinical relevance in these pathologies."

    "title": "Genetic Polymorphisms Associated with Fetal Hemoglobin (HbF) Levels and F-Cell Numbers: A Systematic Review of Genome-Wide Association Studies.",
    "abstract": "Elevated fetal hemoglobin (HbF), which is partly controlled by genetic modifiers, ameliorates disease severity in β hemoglobinopathies. Understanding the genetic basis of this trait holds great promise for personalized therapeutic approaches. PubMed, MedRxiv, and the GWAS Catalog were searched up to May 2024 to identify eligible GWAS studies following PRISMA guidelines. Four independent reviewers screened, extracted, and synthesized data using narrative and descriptive methods. Study quality was assessed using a modified version of the Q-Genie tool. Pathway enrichment analysis was conducted on gene lists derived from the selected GWAS studies. Out of 113 initially screened studies, 62 underwent full-text review, and 16 met the inclusion criteria for quality assessment and data synthesis. A total of 939 significant SNP-trait associations (<i>p</i>-value < 1 × 10<sup>-5</sup>) were identified, mapping to 133 genes (23 with overlapping variant positions) and 103 intergenic sequences. Most SNP-trait associations converged around <i>BCL11A</i> (chr.2), <i>HBS1L-MYB</i>, (chr.6), olfactory receptor and beta globin (<i>HBB</i>) gene clusters (chr.11), with less frequent loci including <i>FHIT</i> (chr.3), <i>ALDH8A1</i>, <i>BACH2</i>, <i>RPS6KA2</i>, <i>SGK1</i> (chr.6), <i>JAZF1</i> (chr.7), <i>MMP26</i> (chr.11), <i>COCH</i> (chr.14), <i>ABCC1</i> (chr.16), <i>CTC1</i>, <i>PFAS</i> (chr.17), <i>GCDH</i>, <i>KLF1</i>, <i>NFIX</i>, and <i>ZBTB7A</i> (chr.19). Pathway analysis highlighted Gene Ontology (GO) terms and pathways related to olfaction, hemoglobin and haptoglobin binding, and oxygen carrier activity. This systematic review confirms established genetic modifiers of HbF level, while highlighting less frequently associated loci as promising areas for further research. Expanding research across ethnic populations is essential for advancing personalized therapies and enhancing outcomes for individuals with sickle cell disease or β-thalassemia."

    "title": "The Current Role of Hydroxyurea in the Treatment of Sickle Cell Anemia.",
    "abstract": "Despite advancements in treatment of sickle cell disease (SCD), hydroxyurea, a ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor, remains the cornerstone of therapy. While its primary effect is the elevation of fetal hemoglobin (HbF), hydroxyurea's mechanisms of action are multifaceted. Hydroxyurea (HU) reduces leukocyte and platelet counts, decreases the expression of endothelial adhesion molecules CD36 and CD49d, and increases nitric oxide and cyclic nucleotide levels, which may facilitate vascular dilation and further HbF induction. Numerous studies have demonstrated that hydroxyurea therapy reduces the frequency of painful episodes, acute chest syndrome, and the need for erythrocyte transfusions and hospitalizations. Long-term use of hydroxyurea leads to reduced morbidity and mortality. Hydroxyurea should be initiated in children from 9 months of age, including asymptomatic individuals, and is recommended for adults experiencing pain crises that significantly interfere with daily activities or quality of life, as well as those with severe or recurrent vaso-occlusive crises, ACS, or severe symptomatic anemia. Hydroxyurea is not recommended during pregnancy or lactation due to potential teratogenic effects and transfer into breast milk. However, its use may be considered in high-risk patients, particularly during the second and third trimesters. Concerns about secondary tumor development have not been substantiated in long-term follow-up studies. Alternative therapies, including L-glutamine, crizanlizumab, and voxelotor, are not presently approved or available for clinical use in Europe."

    "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> Sickle cell anemia (SCD) is a relatively uncommon health condition in many countries, but it is prevalent in Saudi Arabia mainly due to the high incidence of consanguineous marriages. Regrettably, there are elevated rates of vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs) and blood transfusions, leading to poor quality of life and significant financial strain. <b>Objective(s):</b> This study aimed to assess the frequency of blood transfusions, out-of-pocket expenditures (OOPEs), and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in SCD patients. <b>Methods:</b> This was a questionnaire-based cross-sectional study that involved SCD patients at a university-affiliated tertiary care center in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The patients' medical and sociodemographic characteristics were obtained from the electronic medical records. Data on HRQoL and OOPEs were collected through a questionnaire-based interview. To present the baseline characteristics, descriptive statistics such as mean, standard deviation, frequency, and percentage were used. In addition, various statistical tests, including the Chi-Square test, Student <i>t</i>-test, one-way ANOVA, and multiple linear regression, were performed. <b>Results:</b> One hundred and eighteen patients consented to participate and were included in the analysis. Almost 53% of the patients were females. The mean age of the sample was 31 years, while the age-adjusted quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) was 24.33 years (<i>p</i>-value < 0.0001). Most patients (83.05%) reside in Riyadh with a monthly family income of less than USD 2666.67 (75.42%). Monthly OOPEs were, on average, USD 650.69 ± 1853.96, and one-third of the adult patients reported income loss due to illness, further exacerbating their financial strain. High frequency of blood transfusion (β = -0.0564, <i>p</i>-value = 0.0066) and higher number of comorbidities (β = -0.10367, <i>p</i>-value = 0.0244) were negatively associated with the HRQoL among adult patients. On the other hand, adult patients with higher levels of education had better HRQoL (β = 0.05378, <i>p</i>-value = 0.0377). <b>Conclusions:</b> The findings of this study highlight the negative impact of SCD on patients' HRQoL and financial well-being. This underscores the urgent need for comprehensive systemic approaches to address the challenges posed by SCD in Saudi Arabia."

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a prevalent inherited blood disorder. Globally, approximately 515 000 babies are born with SCD annually, with 75% of these births occurring in Africa. Integrating newborn screening (NBS) for SCD into primary healthcare structures, such as immunisation programmes, holds significant promise, with dried blood spots (DBS)-point-of-care technologies (POCT) like HaemoTypeSC offering cost-effective screening solutions. However, scaling up DBS-POCT for NBS of SCD in Africa remains challenging. This study aims to explore individual, organisational and external factors that may influence the reliability, feasibility, acceptability, adoption and sustainability of using DBS-POCT with HaemoTypeSC for NBS of SCD at primary healthcare centres in African countries. This qualitative study will be conducted in seven African countries that are part of the SickleInAfrica consortium sites. The study design is informed by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) and the Implementation Outcome Model. Participants will be mothers whose babies have been diagnosed with SCD, healthcare professionals and policy-makers. In-depth interviews and focus group discussions will be used for data collection. Data analysis will be through thematic analysis. Research ethics approvals have been obtained from the seven countries. Written informed consent will be obtained from all participants. The study results will be disseminated in peer-reviewed scientific journals, scientific conferences, reports to national ministries of public health and webinars."

    "abstract": "This study examined the role of central sensitization in the experience of pain among adolescents and young adults with the most severe genotypes of sickle cell disease (SCD). We hypothesized that adolescents and young adults with chronic SCD pain would demonstrate a higher perceptual response to repeated stimulation of identical intensity (i.e., temporal summation of pain, TSP) compared to counterparts with infrequent pain. We also examined psychological risk factors that can impact pain sensitivity. Patients ages 12-21 years, diagnosed with SCD type Hb SS or Hb S Beta0Thalasemia, who reported infrequent pain (≤2 pain days/month; n = 25) or met AAPT criteria for chronic SCD pain (n = 25) were enrolled. Patients were age- and sex-matched, with similar proportions receiving chronic blood transfusion and hydroxyurea. Patients completed static quantitative sensory testing (QST) and dynamic TSP testing to assess pain sensitivity. Patients and a caregiver completed demographic and psychological measures (depression, anxiety, pain interference, pain catastrophizing). Simple slope analysis revealed differentially elevated heat TSP among adolescents and young adults with chronic SCD pain (b = 3.14, p = .002) but not those with infrequent pain (b = 0.45, p = .61). Faster habituation was further observed for those with chronic compared to infrequent pain. Adolescents and young adults with chronic pain reported more frequent depression, anxiety, and pain interference symptoms; however, psychological symptoms and pain catastrophizing were not associated with QST or TSP (ps >.17). Current results demonstrate that a well-established, prognostic, QST risk marker (i.e., TSP) may distinguish chronic from infrequent pain subgroups of adolescents and young adults with SCD."

    "title": "Determination of the Level of von Willebrand Factor, ADAMTS13, and Ratio of ADAMTS13:von Willebrand Factor in Sickle Cell Disease Patients.",
    "abstract": "Sickle cell anemia (SCA) is a hypercoagulable state characterized by a significant alteration in hemostatic parameters which may predispose an increased risk of vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC). Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most common genetic disorder in sub-Saharan Africa. Nigeria bears a high disease burden with an estimated prevalence of 1%-3% of its population being affected by the disease. The study seeks to determine the role of von Willebrand factor (VWF), ADAMTS13, and the ratio of ADAMTS13:VWF antigen in the pathogenesis of VOC. The objective of this study is to evaluate the level of VWF, ADAMTS13, and their ratio in SCD subjects in Calabar and to determine their role in the pathogenesis of VOC. This is a comparative study carried out at the University of Calabar Teaching Hospital (UCTH), Calabar. Sixty SCA patients were evaluated in VOC and steady states as well as five parented healthy controls. VWF: Ag and ADAMTS13:Ag were evaluated using Assaypro enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits with Lot nos. 01751728 and 04222167R, respectively. Data were analyzed by IBM SPSS Chicago software version 21. The study was approved by the UCTH Institution Ethical Review Board. The mean ages of the SCA subjects and controls were 23.5 ± 7.2 years and 26.5 ± 5.6 years, respectively (P = 0.706). There were 23 (38.3%) males in the SCA group and 21 (42.0%) females in the controls. There was no significant difference in their sex distribution (P = 0.063). The mean (standard deviation [SD]) of VWF in VOC, steady state, and controls were 2.52 ± 0.34, 1.34 ± 0.23, and 1.41 ± 0.23 IU/mL, respectively. The differences in mean were significantly higher in VOC state (P = 0.003). The mean ± SD of ADAMTS13 in VOC, steady state, and controls were 0.61 ± 0.10, 0.44 ± 0.06, and 0.62 ± 0.10 μg/L, respectively. ADAMTS13 levels did not differ significantly across the groups (P = 0.270). Similarly, there was no significant difference between ADAMTS13:VWF ratios across the groups (P = 0.318). VWF level is elevated in VOC state and thus may be implicated in the pathogenesis of VOC. ADAMTS13 and the ratio of ADAMTS13:VWF are not significantly affected in VOC."
