    "title": "Silent but significant: Functional elucidation of a synonymous ATP7B mutation in Wilson's disease pedigrees.",
    "abstract": "Wilson's disease (hepatolenticular degeneration) is a common hereditary neurological disorder. Early diagnosis, particularly the widespread implementation of genetic testing and timely intervention, is crucial for improving the prognosis of this disease. However, limited data exist on genotype-phenotype correlations, thereby impeding accurate early clinical diagnosis. Whole-exome sequencing was performed on the proband and family members to detect genetic variants associated with the clinical phenotype. Bioinformatics tools (HSF, SpliceAI and ESEfinder 3.0) were used to predict the impact of mutations on the splicing function of precursor mRNA. The <i>in vitro</i> minigene experiment was conducted to verify the impact of the mutation on the splicing function of the precursor mRNA. Whole-exome sequencing of the proband identified a synonymous variant c.2145C>T (p. Tyr715=) and a pathogenic frameshift mutation c.2304dupC (p. Met769Hisfs*26) in the <i>ATP7B</i> gene, both associated with the clinical phenotype. The frameshift mutation c.2304dupC (p. Met769His fs*26) on the other allele was a known pathogenic variant causing protein truncation. Bioinformatics tools (HSF, SpliceAI, and ESEfinder 3.0) predicted that the c.2145C>T mutation might disrupt nearby splicing sites. <i>In vitro</i> minigene assays confirmed aberrant precursor mRNA splicing caused by <i>ATP7B</i> c.2145C>T (p. Tyr715=) synonymous mutation, resulting in reduced abundance of normal transcripts. The compound heterozygous variants (c.2145C>T and c.2304dupC) in ATP7B likely synergistically contribute to the proband's abnormal clinical phenotype, aligning with the recessive inheritance pattern of Wilson's disease."

    "title": "Mechanistic insights into the therapeutic effects on liver fibrosis in Wilson's disease: a transcriptomic and network pharmacology-based approach.",
    "abstract": "The mechanism of the Bushen Huoxue Huazhuo Formula (BSHXHZF) in treating Wilson's disease (WD) liver fibrosis was investigated in this study using transcriptomics, network pharmacology, and molecular docking approaches. Differentially expressed long non-coding RNAs (DELncRNAs) and messenger RNAs in the liver tissues of different groups were identified using high-throughput chip sequencing. Furthermore, the target genes of DELncRNAs were identified, followed by GO functional enrichment and KEGG pathway analyses. DELncRNAs were validated using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Active compounds of BSHXHZF and their associated pathways relevant to liver fibrosis treatment in WD, with initial validation via molecular docking. Transcriptomic analysis identified 63 DELncRNAs by comparing the control with the model and treatment groups. Key DELncRNAs included NONMMUT060008.2, NONMMUT096375.1, and ENSMUST00000153523. Target genes such as <i>Pik3cd, Pld1, Oprd1, Ppp2r2b</i>, and <i>Cers5</i> were implicated in sphingolipid signaling, metabolism, and AMPK pathways. The \"BSHXHZF-Component-Target\" network highlighted active ingredients, including tanshinone IIA, quercetin, and luteolin, which play key roles in treating liver fibrosis. Main signaling pathways included IL-17, HIF-1, prolactin, and NF-ÎºB. The therapeutic effects of BSHXHZF in liver fibrosis associated with WD are likely linked to its modulation of sphingolipid and IL-17 signaling pathways."

    "title": "Lipoprotein X - Pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management.",
    "abstract": "Lipoprotein X (LpX) was first discovered in the 1960s in patients with severe cholestatic diseases as an abnormal lipoprotein that is distinct from other lipoproteins because it is not produced through regulated pathways, contains albumin as the primary protein, and is rich in free cholesterol (FC) and phospholipids. Over the next few decades, its biochemical properties and composition were characterized. Elevated blood levels of LpX are now also known to occur in various other conditions, such as lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) deficiency, graft versus host disease, and after lipid infusions for nutritional support. LpX cannot be measured by conventional testing with a standard lipid panel. The cholesterol content of LpX is included in total cholesterol (TC) and misreported as elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) - this is due to similar densities of LpX and LDL on ultracentrifugation. Typically, the elevations are severe in magnitude, to the extent that the standard lipid panel can look similar to a patient with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. When LpX is clinically suspected, laboratory testing with measurements of apolipoprotein B, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, lipoprotein gel electrophoresis, or measurement of FC is required to distinguish elevated levels of LpX from other forms of hypercholesterolemia, such as familial hypercholesterolemia. Being an uncommon disorder with an estimated prevalence of 0.02% to 0.09%, if LpX is not considered in the differential diagnosis, the presence of falsely reported levels of elevated LDL-C and low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) may mimic an atherogenic phenotype, leading to treatment with lipid-lowering therapy (LLT). Rather than atherosclerosis, patients with increased blood LpX levels are at risk of other complications, including hyperviscosity syndrome and xanthomatosis. The usual lipid-lowering drugs do not effectively lower elevated LpX levels; thus, treatment is primarily directed at the underlying disease, with plasma exchange being reserved for hyperviscosity syndrome. This review discusses the biology, pathogenesis, clinical features, diagnosis, and management of elevated LpX levels."

    "title": "Treatment adherence patterns for patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease: Patient and provider perspectives.",
    "abstract": "Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is a leading cause of mortality, affecting more than 500 million individuals globally. National guidelines recommend lipid-lowering therapies (LLTs) as first line agents for both primary and secondary prevention of ASCVD. However, under-prescribing of pharmacologic LLTs and sub-optimal medication adherence remain common problems. This mixed-methods study aimed to identify patient and prescriber factors influencing adherence to LLTs. Patients with an ASCVD diagnosis and treatment plan that included LLT were sampled from a large community health system serving seven states. A stratified random sample of 2500 patients was surveyed by mail, capturing barriers and facilitators to medication adherence using an adapted version of the Adherence Starts with Knowledge-12 (ASK-12) scale, achieving a 16.2 % response rate (406 patients). Twenty-three semi-structured interviews were conducted with a sample of patient survey respondents to further explore drivers of non-adherence. Eligible prescribers with experience treating patients with ASCVD were surveyed by email, resulting in a 3.3 % response rate (122 respondents). Survey data were analyzed descriptively and using regression models; interview data were analyzed thematically. While cohort patients were identified as having an ASCVD diagnosis and taking a LLT from their medical chart, only 16.8 % of respondents reported having an ASCVD diagnosis and 84.2 % reported taking LLTs. Patients taking medication reported a higher average number of health condition diagnoses compared to those not taking a medication (2.63 and 1.50, respectively). Of those taking medication, 55.7 % were identified as adherent. Non-adherent patients were more likely to report poor healthcare experiences and social determinants of health needs. Multivariable regression analysis revealed that patients were more likely to be adherent when they felt their healthcare provider always spent enough time with them and treated them with respect. Interview findings further emphasized the importance of healthcare experiences, convenience, and belief the treatment works as important factors to adherence. In contrast, prescribers perceived higher non-adherence rates, citing forgetfulness and medication inconvenience as the main barriers. However, only 10.0 % of responding prescribers reported using a tool to assess patients' medication adherence and only 42.6 % reported asking patients about changes to their medication regimens. A substantial proportion of patients reported adherence to their medications, with adherence being associated with positive healthcare experiences, self-reported health conditions, perceived effectiveness of the medication, and social determinants of health needs. Prescribers perceived relatively low adherence among their patients, however only a small percent reported using tools to assess medication adherence. Comprehensive assessment tools and open communication could optimize patient care and enhance medication adherence and treatment outcomes."

    "abstract": "Knowledge of the factors structuring populations of pathogenic fungi is fundamental to disease management efforts and basic biology. However, this crucial information is missing for many important pathogens, including broad host range and drought-associated pathogens from the globally distributed <i>Macrophomina</i> genus. The objectives of this work were to evaluate the evidence for host specialization, geographic adaptation, and recombination using a global survey of <i>Macrophomina</i> isolates from diverse geographic, temporal, and host sources. We obtained high-quality short-read sequence data for 463 <i>Macrophomina</i> spp. isolates, representing four putative species, collected from 91 host plant species and soil in 23 countries. Analysis of bi-allelic, single nucleotide polymorphismsrevealed high diversity, admixture, and equal mating type ratios suggesting on-going recombination. Although most tested isolates asymptomatically colonized strawberry, only strawberry-derived isolates caused disease on this host. These isolates were all in a single lineage, suggesting the ability to cause disease on strawberry is not widespread among <i>M. phaseolina</i>. Significant associations were also found between isolation from soybean plants and specific population clusters, suggesting that specialization for virulence or reproduction has also occurred for soybean. Geography Ã isolate genotype associations were weak, suggesting <i>Macrophomina</i> spp. were frequently trafficked between regions. Reference free whole genome comparisons support current boundaries among four <i>Macrophomina</i> species, and new molecular markers were designed to specifically identify each species. Contrary to expectations, <i>M. phaseolina</i> should be considered a single species with both specialist and generalist populations in which meiosis can maintain genetic diversity."

    "title": "Characterizing Long COVID Symptoms During Early Childhood.",
    "abstract": "Recent studies have identified characteristic symptom patterns of long COVID (LC) in adults and children older than 5 years. However, LC remains poorly characterized in early childhood. This knowledge gap limits efforts to identify, care for, and prevent LC in this vulnerable population. To identify symptoms that had the greatest difference in frequency comparing children with a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection to those without, to identify differences in the types of symptoms by age group (infants/toddlers [0-2 years] vs preschool-aged children [3-5 years]), and to derive an index that can be used in research studies to identify young children with LC. This was a multisite longitudinal cohort study with enrollment from over 30 US health care and community settings, including infants, toddlers, and preschool-aged children with and without SARS-CoV-2 infection history. Study data were analyzed from May to December 2024. SARS-CoV-2 infection. LC and 41 symptoms among infants/toddlers and 75 symptoms among preschool-aged children. The study included 472 infants/toddlers (mean [SD] age, 12 [9] months; 278 infected with SARS-CoV-2; 194 uninfected; 234 male [50%]; 73 Black or African American [16%]; 198 Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish [43%]; 242 White [52%]) and 539 preschool-aged children (mean [SD] age, 48 [10] months; 399 infected with SARS-CoV-2; 140 uninfected; 277 female [51%]; 70 Black or African American [13%]; 210 Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish [39%]; 287 White [54%]). The median (IQR) time between first infections and completion of symptom surveys was 318 (198-494) days for infants/toddlers and 520 (330-844) days for preschool-aged children. A research index was derived for each age group based on symptoms most associated with infection history. The index is calculated by summing scores assigned to each prolonged symptom that was present, where higher scores indicate greater magnitude of association with history of SARS-CoV-2 infection: poor appetite (5 points), trouble sleeping (3.5 points), wet cough (3.5 points), dry cough (3 points), and stuffy nose (0.5 points) for infants/toddlers, and daytime tiredness/sleepiness/low energy (6.5 points) and dry cough (3 points) for preschool-aged children. Among infants/toddlers with infection, 40 of 278 (14%) were classified as having probable LC by having an index of at least 4 points. Among preschool-aged children, 61 of 399 (15%) were classified as having probable LC by having an index of at least 3 points. Participants with higher indices often had poorer overall health, lower quality of life, and perceived delays in developmental milestones. This cohort study identified symptom patterns and derived research indices that were distinct between the 2 age groups and differed from those previously identified in older ages, demonstrating the need to characterize LC separately across age ranges."

    "abstract": "Psoriasis is a chronic immune-mediated skin disease with known physical and mental health comorbidities, such as cardiovascular disease, depression, and anxiety. Psoriasis also has a significant impact on quality of life and sleep due to factors like itch and pain. This study aims to assess the relationship between sleep quality, mental health, and psoriasis, and specifically investigate the impact of poor sleep quality on mental health outcomes within participants with psoriasis. In this cross-sectional study, we enrolled 556 participants into two cohorts: 487 participants were enrolled into the psoriasis cohort, and 69 were enrolled into the healthy control cohort. The demographics, disease severity, family history, sleep quality (PROMIS 8a, PROMIS 8b, and Insomnia Severity Index), and mental health (Patient Health Questionnaire-8 and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7) of participants were assessed. Descriptive analysis and logistic regression models were employed to examine sleep and mental health, adjusting for potential confounders like demographics and comorbidities. A comparison of patients with psoriasis and healthy controls revealed worsened sleep and mental health outcomes in patients with psoriasis. Among participants with psoriasis, greater sleep impairment (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) 8a), sleep disturbance (PROMIS 8b), and insomnia were significantly associated with anxiety (ORa 1.22; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.16, 1.30; ORa 1.26; 95% CI 1.16, 1.80; ORa 5.13; 95% CI 2.91, 9.33; respectively) and depression (ORa 1.42; 95% CI 1.32, 1.56; ORa 1.16; 95% CI 1.08, 1.26; ORa 7.04; 95% CI 4.01, 12.77; respectively). These findings underscore the importance of recognizing how psoriasis can impact mental health and sleep. Building a collaborative relationship between patients with psoriasis and their providers is essential to improve overall sleep and life quality."

    "abstract": "Expanded carrier screening (ECS) enables proactive identification of at-risk couples (ARCs) and individuals, facilitating informed reproductive decision-making through genetic counseling. This study evaluates the clinical utility of ECS among the population in Anhui Province, China, where its implementation remains understudied. Retrospectively analysis of genetic testing results assessed the carrier frequencies for targeted diseases, identified prevalent pathogenic genes and variants, and ARCs detection rate alongside associated reproductive choices and pregnancy outcomes. In this single-center retrospective study (June 2020-October 2023), 2,530 reproductive-aged individuals (486 couples; 1,558 individuals) underwent next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based ECS using a customized panel targeting 152 recessive monogenic disorders. Carrier rates, pathogenic variants, ARC detection, and subsequent reproductive outcomes were analyzed. Overall, 38.50% (974/2,530) of participants carried â¥ 1 pathogenic/likely pathogenic (P/LP) variant. The most prevalent autosomal recessive (AR) disorders included DFNB4 (3.08%), DFNB1A (2.81%), Wilson disease (2.57%), Krabbe disease (2.37%), and phenylketonuria (2.13%). Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD, 0.28%) was the most common X-linked (XL) disorder. Twenty ARCs (4.12%, 20/486) were identified, including sixteen pregnant couples. Among these, 56.25% (9/16) opted for invasive prenatal diagnosis, confirming eight unaffected fetuses with healthy live births and one twin pregnancy requiring selective termination of an affected fetus. Five pregnant ARCs declined prenatal diagnosis, four of whom delivered healthy infants, while one pregnancy was terminated due to structural anomalies. Of three non-pregnant ARCs, two pursued preimplantation genetic testing for monogenic disorders (PGT-M), resulting in one healthy birth. Our study demonstrated that the ECS for reproductive-age individuals can identify couples and individuals at risk of conceiving a child with a recessive genetic disorder and support reproductive choices through the provision of genetic counseling to reduce the likelihood of offspring with congenital anomalies."

    "abstract": "Spinal cord (SC) atrophy correlates with and predicts the underlying progressive biology in active and non-active multiple sclerosis (MS), thereby providing a biomarker for clinical trials and patient management. Initiation of disease-modifying therapy (DMT) may be followed by early pronounced central nervous system (CNS) volume loss due to resolution of inflammation (pseudoatrophy) and confounding the interpretation of atrophy. High-dose glucocorticoids (HDGs) reduce inflammation and might therefore modify pseudoatrophy. One hundred twenty-three newly diagnosed and DMT-naÃ¯ve MS participants (relapsing-remitting, 70% female participants, median age = 36 years, Expanded Disability Status Scale [EDSS] 2.0) were followed for up to 3 years. Forty-two participants received HDG before baseline magnetic resonance imaging (MRI; DMT-HDG; median = 52 days, interquartile range [IQR] = 37-71), whereas 60 did not (DMT/no-HDG). Twenty-one participants remained untreated (no-DMT), and 102 started DMT after baseline MRI. SC total cervical cord cross-sectional area (TCA), gray matter area (GMA), and white matter area (WMA) and regional brain volumes were analyzed using mixed effects models. The DMT-HDG, DMT/no-HDG, and no-DMT groups had similar demographic, clinical, and radiological features. Pronounced SC pseudoatrophy was observed based on more year 1 versus year 2 volume loss for DMT/no-HDG (-2.06% vs. 0.83%; P = 0.02) but not DMT-HDG (-0.51% vs. 0.66%; P = 0.8) and more year 1 volume loss for DMT/no-HDG compared to DMT-HDG (-2.06% vs. 0.51%; P = 0.02). HDG preceding baseline MRI suppresses CNS white matter (WM) pseudoatrophy after DMT initiation, most conspicuously for the SC. Suppression of pseudoatrophy with HDG may improve the fidelity of clinical trials and enhance the feasibility for short-term trials with SC and brain MRI outcomes in active MS by pretreatment with HDG.

After reviewing current knowledge and practices, we have formulated the recommendation that NASPGHAN committees should develop clinical guidelines that identify specific and relevant health assessment measures with strong validity evidence, including patient-reported outcome measures. Guidelines should also outline clinical pathways, incorporating clinical decision support algorithms to provide feedback to users, and order sets to ensure the right guidance is provided for the right patient at the right time. Patient populations should be defined by using standard code sets. Committees should identify disease-specific health assessment measures with strong validity of evidence and identify areas where measures are still needed.

    "abstract": "Individuals with Wilson's disease (WD) exhibit liver fibrosis, a basic pathological change that was recently demonstrated to be dynamic and reversible. The gut microbiota markedly influences the occurrence of WD. Gandouling (GDL), a standardized Chinese herbal formula, has demonstrated an anti-fibrotic effect against WD-associated liver fibrosis. We sought to determine whether GDL may prevent liver fibrosis in toxic milk (TX) mice by assessing its ability to regulate gut microbiota, metabolites, and barrier function. TX male mice aged 6 months were analysed. GDL was administered at varying doses over a 6-week period. The biochemical indexes related to liver function, fibrosis, and inflammation were determined using commercial assay kits. Histological analyses and immunohistochemistry staining, were performed to evaluate the histopathological changes and collagen deposition in mouse liver tissues. Additionally, to detect alterations in the intestinal bacterial composition and metabolites, faecal samples were examined using non-targeted metabolomics and 16S rRNA sequencing. The administration of GDL demonstrated anti-fibrotic effects on the liver, decreased serum inflammatory markers, ameliorated liver histopathology, and restored ileal permeability in the model group, as compared to the control group. Furthermore, a medium dosage of GDL treatment significantly rebalance microbiota composition and function and modulated lipid and lipid-like molecule levels. Modulating intestinal homeostasis is a promising approach for treating liver fibrosis in patients with WD. Therefore, GDL may serve as a useful agent for treating WD-associated liver fibrosis."

The CD131 receptor is indispensable for signalling by the Î² common (Î²c) family of cytokines encompassing granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, interleukin (IL)-5 and IL-3, which instigate both type-2 and non-type-2 inflammatory responses. This study aims to determine whether antagonising CD131 signalling can prevent pulmonary inflammation, alveolar cell death and emphysema development. We performed in-house and <i>in silico</i> transcriptomic analysis to investigate the gene expression of CD131 (<i>CSF2RB</i>) and pathway enrichment for Î²c cytokine signalling in blood, sputum and lung biopsies of COPD patients. To model emphysema, transgenic mice expressing human CD131 were exposed to elastase or cigarette smoke (CS) and a fully human monoclonal antibody (CSL311) was employed to inhibit CD131 signalling. CD131 gene expression was significantly increased in COPD, along with an enrichment of gene set for Î²c cytokine signalling. In transgenic mice subjected to emphysema models, CD131 antagonism effectively prevented lung injury, alveolar cell death and emphysema development. Mechanistically, RNA sequencing identified pathway enrichment for myeloid cell activation, type-2 immune response and macrophage alternative activation in elastase-induced emphysematous mice, mirroring human COPD. Blocking CD131 signalling almost completely reversed the global gene expression alterations associated with emphysema development. CD131 signalling orchestrates pulmonary inflammation in COPD, resulting in immunopathology that underpins emphysema and lung function decline. Antagonising CD131 therefore represents a unique strategy to simultaneously target multiple pathogenic myeloid cell populations."

Given the different pathophysiology of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), an inflammatory polyarthritis, this cross-sectional study assessed CAP's psychometric properties and its association with pain in RA. Adults with RA were recruited from Nottinghamshire, London, and Cardiff. Participants completed CAP and reported pain using a numerical rating scale. A subgroup underwent additional assessments, including quantitative sensory testing (QST; Pressure Pain detection Threshold, Temporal Summation, Conditioned Pain Modulation), Disease Activity Score-28, C-reactive protein, questionnaires addressing pain and related characteristics, and Central Sensitization Inventory short form (CSI-9). Cronbach alpha, confirmatory factor (CFA), and Rasch measurement theory assessed CAP's reliability and validity. Multivariable linear regression modelled contributions to pain by inflammation indices and CAP or CSI-9. The 380 participants (73% female, median 63 years) reported average pain over the past 4 weeks of 6/10 and a CAP score of 9/16. Central aspects of pain demonstrated acceptable reliability (ICC<sub>(2,1)</sub> = 0.71), CFA fit (comparative fit index = 0.99, Tucker-Lewis index = 0.99, root mean square error of approximation = 0.034, standardized root mean residuals = 0.03), and internal consistency (Î± = 0.82). Central aspects of pain was significantly associated with pain (0.50 â¤ Î² â¤ 0.57) but not QST. Central aspects of pain explained 33% of pain variance, rising to 42% with inflammation, age, sex, and body mass index.

Current studies evaluating disparities among patients with shoulder instability are limited to the adult population or surgical patients. To evaluate how educational, health/environmental, and social/economic disparities influence the timing of shoulder instability treatment and shoulder instability severity among adolescents. Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. A retrospective review of patients aged 10 to 19 years diagnosed with shoulder instability from January 2022 to April 2024 at a single institution was conducted. The Child Opportunity Index (COI) was used to evaluate inequalities in educational, health/environmental, and social/economic opportunities. Disease severity was determined using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), including glenoid bone loss, Hill-Sachs interval size, distance to dislocation, and presence of an off-track lesion. Continuous variables were analyzed with the Mann-Whitney <i>U</i> test or the Spearman correlation coefficient, while categorical variables were analyzed using the chi-square test. Significance was set at <i>P</i> < .05. There were 181 patients who met the inclusion criteria. Patients with a lower overall COI had a longer time from injury to initial presentation (<i>r</i> = -0.15; <i>P</i> = .048), injury to orthopaedic evaluation (<i>r</i> = -0.17; <i>P</i> = .027), and injury to MRI (<i>r</i> = -0.16; <i>P</i> = .033) but not from injury to surgery.

    "abstract": "This study aims to understand healthcare providers' (HCPs) decision to adopt double combination therapy with ERA + PDE5i for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), and to explore whether a single tablet combination therapy (STCT) might increase adoption practices. 195 US HCPs completed a survey evaluating their PAH treatment preferences. HCPs' willingness to use double combination ERA + PDE5i was assessed using a discrete choice experiment (DCE). The sample predominantly included physicians (73.3%) from centers of excellence (63.1%), with a mean of 117.4 PAH patients treated in the past year. Key factors influencing ERA + PDE5i adoption in the DCE were the patient's current treatment (17.9), PAH etiology (16.2), existing comorbidities (14.1), and history of side effects (12.7), with higher scores indicating stronger preference. HCPs were more likely to select ERA + PDE5i for patients currently on PDE5i monotherapy, with idiopathic PAH, and without comorbidities or a history of side effects. Regarding STCT, most HCPs reported that it would allow them to initiate ERA + PDE5i sooner (76.4%) and improve patient compliance (82.6%). However, concerns regarding cost/insurance issues (63.6%) and a history of side effects (50.8%) were identified as limitations to adopting STCT. Patients' current therapy, the cause of PAH, comorbidities, and side effects are key factors influencing whether US providers are willing to treat them with ERA + PDE5i. Providers perceive that STCT may help HCPs initiate ERA + PDE5i sooner, improve compliance, and simplify initiation of upfront double therapy and delivery of triple therapy. Addressing cost and insurance barriers will be critical to realizing these potential benefits."

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative changes are key manifestations of Wilson disease (WD), causing neurological symptoms including parkinsonism, tremors, and dystonia. However, the neuroimaging correlates of specific neurological manifestations (especially dystonia) in WD remain poorly characterized. 37 WD patients and 37 healthy controls (HC) were recruited. All subjects underwent structural magnetic resonance scanning, muscle biomechanical measurements, and the Unified Wilson Disease Rating Scale for Neurology (UWDRS-N) assessment. Neurodegenerative changes, identified as gray matter volume (GV) changes, were analyzed via voxel-based morphometry (VBM) in WD compared to HC. Clinical symptoms were linked to GV changes in WD patients' brains. Compared with HC, WD patients had GV loss in the bilateral caudate nucleus, putamen, cerebellum (Crus1), left amygdala, right posterior insular lobe, and right parahippocampal gyrus and increased GV in the bilateral anterior insular lobes. In cortical areas, UWDRS-N significantly negatively correlated with GV in the bilateral posterior insula lobes, part of temporal lobe, optic cortex, frontal lobe, and cingulate cortex, while positively correlated with that in bilateral anterior insular lobes and putamen. Moreover, the GV from the left parahippocampal gyrus, bilateral hippocampus, and bilateral caudate nucleus showed a strong positive correlation with the <i>F</i> value of the right gastrocnemius medial head. In WD patients with neurological symptoms, obvious abnormal GV values in the cortico-striatal-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) circuit were noted. These GV changes were linked to UWDRS-N and correlated with muscle tension. The study mapped UWDRS-N and muscle biomechanics in GV-impaired areas, suggesting altered GV (especially in basal ganglia) as a key imaging sign of WD severity. This indicates that the CSTC circuit could act as a biomarker for WD neurological symptoms and affect WD dystonia mechanisms. Additionally, it shows that muscle-related biological parameters can assess WD dystonia severity and neurological damage. clinicaltrials.gov, identifier NCT05305872."

    "title": "Assessment of Prognostic Factors of Acute Hepatitis Among Pediatric Patients: A Cross-Sectional Study.",
    "abstract": "Early identification of acute hepatitis etiology and specific management is crucial for reducing morbidity and mortality. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the prognostic factors of acute hepatitis in children. This cross-sectional study was conducted on children with diagnosis of acute hepatitis According to the criteria of ESPHAGAN, admitted to the Children's Hospital from March 2018 to March 2023. Data were analyzed using SPSS statistical software. A total of 164 patients with acute hepatitis were included, comprising 78 patients with acute liver failure and 86 patients without acute liver failure. Viral infections were identified as the most common etiology of acute hepatitis and were significantly more prevalent in patients without acute liver failure. Wilson's disease was significantly more prevalent in patients with acute liver failure. All patients with viral etiology recovered. Among the 24 patients with Wilson's disease, 14 (58.3%) underwent transplantation, 4 (16.6%) were deceased, and 6 (25%) survived without transplantation. Patients with other etiologies did not experience any mortality, with only 13.8% undergoing transplantation due to autoimmune causes. Low albumin (< 2.5), prolonged PT (> 22), elevated INR (> 3), encephalopathy, low phosphorus (< 3), and a duration of more than 7 days between symptom onset and hospitalization significantly increased the risk of mortality or need for transplantation in patients with acute liver disease. Albumin levels, PT, INR, encephalopathy, phosphorus levels, and the duration between symptom onset and hospitalization are significant prognostic factors for acute hepatitis in pediatric patients."

    "abstract": "Serum lipid levels, which are influenced by both genetic and environmental factors, are key determinants of cardiometabolic health and are influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Improving our understanding of their underlying biological mechanisms can have important public health and therapeutic implications. Although psychosocial factors, including depression, anxiety, and perceived social support, are associated with serum lipid levels, it is unknown if they modify the effect of genetic loci that influence lipids. We conducted a genome-wide gene-by-psychosocial factor interaction (GÃPsy) study in up to 133,157 individuals to evaluate if GÃPsy influences serum lipid levels. We conducted a two-stage meta-analysis of GÃPsy using both a one-degree of freedom (1df) interaction test and a joint 2df test of the main and interaction effects. In Stage 1, we performed GÃPsy analyses on up to 77,413 individuals and promising associations (P < 10<sup>-5</sup>) were evaluated in up to 55,744 independent samples in Stage 2. Significant findings (P < 5 Ã 10<sup>-8</sup>) were identified based on meta-analyses of the two stages. There were 10,230 variants from 120 loci significantly associated with serum lipids. We identified novel associations for variants in four loci using the 1df test of interaction, and five additional loci using the 2df joint test that were independent of known lipid loci. Of these 9 loci, 7 could not have been detected without modeling the interaction as there was no evidence of association in a standard GWAS model. The genetic diversity of included samples was key in identifying these novel loci: four of the lead variants displayed very low frequency in European ancestry populations. Functional annotation highlighted promising loci for further experimental follow-up, particularly rs73597733 (MACROD2), rs59808825 (GRAMD1B), and rs11702544 (RRP1B). Notably, one of the genes in identified loci (RRP1B) was found to be a target of the approved drug Atenolol suggesting potential for drug repurposing. Overall, our findings suggest that taking interaction between genetic variants and psychosocial factors into account and including genetically diverse populations can lead to novel discoveries for serum lipids."

    "title": "Neutropenia Associated With B Cell-Depleting Therapies in Multiple Sclerosis and Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder.",
    "abstract": "Neutropenia is described as a rare adverse event associated with B cell-depleting therapy (BCDT) use in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD). However, little is known about longitudinal clinical outcomes. We estimated the real-world incidence of neutropenia among patients with neuroinflammatory disease treated with BCDT and characterized the clinical course. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using electronic medical records to estimate the incidence rate of neutropenia in adults with MS/NMOSD from a neuroimmunology clinic in California between January 6, 2006, and November 2, 2015, treated with ocrelizumab, rituximab, ofatumumab, ublituximab, or inebilizumab. Each clinical course (recurrence, time to recovery of absolute neutrophil count [ANC], postneutropenia treatment) of neutropenia was then presented in a case series. In this cohort of 1,825 patients (6,009 person-years on BCDT), the largest cohort addressing this question to date, 37 developed neutropenia. The estimated incidence rate of neutropenia was 0.62 (95% CI 0.45-0.85) per 100 person-years. The median time from last infusion of current BCDT was 4 months (interquartile range [IQR] 1-6). The median nadir ANC was 390 (IQR 40-960); the nadir ANC was 0 for 6 patients (16%). All patients ultimately recovered to normal counts, except 2 patients developing fluctuating ANCs for months. Among the 32 patients not receiving filgrastim, the median time to ANC recovery was 11 days (95% CI 7-26). Course severity was asymptomatic/mild in 32% (n = 12) while 54% (n = 20) required hospitalization. A confirmed simultaneous infection or infectious prodrome occurred in 23 (62%). After recovery, 30 patients (81%) continued BCDT and 2 (7%) changed within BCDT class. Neutropenia recurred in 13 patients (35%), including 3 who discontinued BCDT after initial neutropenia. The estimated incidence rate of recurrent neutropenia was 0.22 (95% CI 0.13-0.39) per 100 person-years. The mean (SD) time to recurrence from initial neutropenia was 251 (SD: 355) days. This study is comprehensive and reflects a large cohort, examining incidence rates of neutropenia with BCDT in MS and NMOSD. Overall, neutropenia was still rare, occurring at a rate of 0.66 per 100 person-years, and infections were associated triggers in some patients. Yet, of relevance to clinicians, neutropenia was not benign: half required hospitalization and 35% experienced recurrence, which is higher than what was reported in clinical trials."

    "title": "Biomarker Discovery in Wilson's Disease-A Path Toward Improved Diagnosis and Management: A Comprehensive Review.",
    "abstract": "Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by defective copper metabolism, which leads to hepatic and neurological damage. The clinical presentation of WD varies significantly, often resulting in delayed diagnosis and an increased risk of irreversible complications. Current diagnostic tools, including biochemical assays, imaging techniques, and genetic testing, lack sufficient specificity and sensitivity, highlighting the need for novel biomarkers for early diagnosis and treatment monitoring. This review explores emerging biomarkers for both hepatic and neurological manifestations of WD, including blood-based molecular markers such as cytokines, proteases, oxidative stress indicators, inflammasomes, and gut microbiota signatures. Recent studies have identified neurofilament light chain (NfL), pentraxin 3 (PTX3), caspase-3/XIAP, and NLRP3 inflammasome activation as promising indicators of neurological impairment. Additionally, markers like soluble CD163 (sCD163) and apoptosis antigen 1 (APO-1) show potential for assessing hepatic dysfunction. Metabolomic and proteomic analyses further suggest distinct molecular profiles associated with different WD subtypes, while microRNA-based biomarkers offer novel insights into disease progression. Identifying and validating these biomarkers could enhance early diagnosis, predict neurological deterioration, and optimize treatment strategies, ultimately improving patient outcomes. Further research is needed to integrate these biomarkers into clinical practice and establish standardized protocols for their use in WD management."

    "abstract": "Acute severe colitis (ASC) is a relatively frequent manifestation in children with ulcerative colitis and one of the few emergencies in paediatric gastroenterology. A standardized proactive approach based on tight monitoring and timely medical and surgical interventions may improve patients' outcomes. We aimed to update the previous ASC guidelines using detailed recommendations and practice points, based on a systematic review of the literature and consensus of experts. These guidelines update is a joint effort of the European Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition and the European Crohn's and Colitis Organization. A systematic search was performed in Pubmed Ovid Medline, Embase and Cochrane databases using 13 predefined PICO (patient, intervention, comparison, outcomes) based questions and 30 non-PICO based questions. Grading methodology was based on the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine-Levels of evidence. The questions were addressed by working subgroups following an iterative consensus voting process, including three online voting meetings and one face-to-face meeting. A total of 36 recommendations and 72 practice points were endorsed with a consensus rate of at least 88% for all statements, regarding initial evaluation, monitoring, medical and surgical treatment of ASC in children. Several topics have been revised since the previous 2018 guidelines and differ from corresponding published adult guidelines. These guidelines present a comprehensive overview of the management of ASC in children, offering practical recommendations and practice points aiming to standardize clinical and surgical treatment and improve outcomes of this severe scenario."

    "abstract": "To explore the role of shared decision-making (SDM) in the implementation of evidence-based practice in women with chronic hypertension planning birth and investigate the barriers and the facilitators in the provision of antenatal care. A multimethod multisite approach was used including case-note review (n=55) and structured observations (n=18) to assess the provision of third trimester antenatal care. The barriers and facilitators to implementation were identified from semistructured qualitative interviews with healthcare professionals (n=13) and pregnant women (n=14) using inductive thematic analysis. The findings were integrated and evaluated using the 'Three Talk Model of Shared Decision-making'. Pregnant women with chronic hypertension, some with superimposed pre-eclampsia and their principal carers at three National Health Service hospital trusts. Healthcare professionals delivering care to pregnant women with high blood pressure were aligned with most communication practices (set out in the Calgary-Cambridge communication guide). Pregnant women with hypertension who described being engaged in shared decisions about birth developed a trusting relationship with their maternity team. Despite frequent caesarean section birth (52%) and early term birth (median gestation at delivery 38 weeks (IQR1 37 weeks, IQR3 39 weeks) identified by case-note review; integrated data (observations, case-note review and qualitative interviews) found pregnant women with high blood pressure were not regularly provided with personalised information based on what they would find helpful, encouraged to share their own thoughts or offered choice in relation to timing or mode of birth. Uncertainty regarding the evidence around optimal timing of birth was the main barrier identified by professionals. Facilitators included training for professionals in SDM, midwife-led antenatal classes for high-risk women and multiprofessional clinics. Strategies to promote more widespread adoption of SDM are likely to improve the experiences of women with high blood pressure making decisions about childbirth."

    "abstract": "It is unclear whether routine testing of women for group B streptococcus (GBS) colonisation either in late pregnancy or during labour reduces early-onset neonatal sepsis, compared with a risk factor-based strategy. Cluster randomised trial. 320 000 women from up to 80 hospital maternity units. Sites will be randomised 1:1 to a routine testing strategy or the risk factor-based strategy, using a web-based minimisation algorithm. A second-level randomisation allocates routine testing sites to either antenatal enriched culture medium testing or intrapartum rapid testing. Intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis will be offered if a test is positive for GBS, or if a maternal risk factor for early-onset GBS infection in her baby is identified before or during labour. Economic and acceptability evaluations will be embedded within the trial design. The primary outcome is all-cause early (<7 days of birth) neonatal sepsis, defined as either a positive blood/cerebrospinal fluid culture, early neonatal death from infection or a negative/unknown culture status with â¥3 agreed clinical signs or symptoms, who receive intravenous antibiotics â¥5 days. All women giving birth â¥24 weeks' gestation, regardless of mode of birth, and all her babies will be included in the dataset. Cost-effectiveness will be expressed in terms of incremental cost per case of early neonatal sepsis avoided and incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year associated with each strategy. The trial received a favourable opinion from Derby Research Ethics Committee on 16 September 2019 (19/EM/0253). The allocated testing strategy will be adopted as standard clinical practice by the site. Women in the routine testing sites will give verbal consent for the test. The trial will use routinely collected data retrieved from National Health Service databases, supplemented with limited participant-level collection of process outcomes.

Biopsies were embedded in glycol methyl acrylate (GMA) resin and examined by immunohistochemistry and staining for enumeration of CD3 + , CD4 + , CD8 + , CD20 + , CD68 + , EG2 + , and NE+ inflammatory cells, as well as endothelial cells (EN4) and smooth muscle actin (SMA). Mucus cells were stained by periodic acid-schiff (PAS), and toluidine blue to visualize the reticular basement membrane (RBM). The numbers of macrophages and eosinophils were higher, and vascularity increased in the submucosa in COPD patients compared with healthy controls. In healthy smokers there were lower numbers of lymphocytes (CD3 +, CD4 +, CD8 +, CD20+) than never smokers. However, COPD patients with GOLD I/II had higher numbers of eosinophils and larger smooth muscle area compared with GOLD III/IV. COPD exacerbations the last year, blood eosinophils, and use of inhaled corticosteroids did not affect levels of inflammation or remodeling. Smoking alters inflammation in healthy controls, while specific patterns of macrophages, eosinophils, and vascularity distinguish COPD from non-COPD in bronchial biopsies."

    "abstract": "This systematic review investigates the correlation between selenium status and thyroid conditions, specifically focusing on autoimmune thyroid diseases (AITD) including Hashimoto's Thyroiditis (HT) and Graves' Disease (GD). After a meticulous analysis of 14 research studies, we explored the impact of selenium levels and supplementation on several thyroid-specific parameters and overall disease progression. Several studies indicated a notable inverse correlation between selenium deficiency and the prevalence and severity of AITD. In particular, HT patients showed consistent improvement with selenium supplementation, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic agent. However, the effect of selenium on GD was not as clear, with some studies indicating no significant correlation. These inconsistent effects demonstrate how nuanced AITD treatment must be. It also shows that selenium plays a varied role in thyroid health. The findings in this review serve as an example of how micronutrient intake is important in thyroid disease management. The nuances of these treatments support a need for more patient-centered and individualized treatment plans, which may be further helped by detailed research into proper dosing and administration strategies. Specific patient populations may benefit from selenium supplementation, though the variability in outcomes points to a need for vigilance in the clinical setting. Importantly, the ability to personalize supplementation depends on establishing a reliable method for detecting selenium deficiency or status. Future clinical guidelines should emphasize the necessity of a solid diagnostic framework that allows for precise monitoring, ensuring that selenium supplementation is appropriately justified and tailored to individual patient needs."

To describe advanced therapy prescribing trends and colectomy rates for patients with UC in Lothian, UK between January 1st, 2004 and December 31st, 2023. We obtained incidence and prevalence data from the Lothian IBD Registry, a rigorously validated population cohort. We report advanced therapy prescribing and colectomy data as raw numbers and annual incidence rates. We used piecewise linear regression analyses to identify temporal trends in prescription and colectomy rates. The prevalence of UC increased from 216 to 441 per 100,000 population in the 20 years from 2004, culminating in a total of 4115 patients with UC in 2023. We identified 720 patients who had received an advanced therapy. Prescribing of first-line advanced therapy increased from 0 in 2004 to 115 in 2023, equating to 0.00 and 2.82 per 100 patients with UC. We identified 563 patients of the prevalent UC population who had colectomy, of whom 68% were performed as emergencies. Absolute colectomy numbers decreased from 42 in 2004 to 7 in 2023, equating to 2.48 and 0.22 per 100 patients with UC. A join point in 2013 was found for both increased advanced therapy prescribing and decreased colectomy rates. The incidence of colectomy in the UC population has decreased over time while the use of advanced therapies has greatly increased."

This study aimed to compare the total levels of essential trace elements (Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Cu, Zn, Se, and Mo) in plasma and urine samples of WD-treated patients (cases) and healthy controls, and to conduct Cu speciation in plasma samples. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) was used for total element concentration, while high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled to ICP-MS (HPLC-ICP-MS) was used to determine the following Cu species: Cu-ceruloplasmin (Cu-Cp), Cu-human serum albumin (Cu-HSA), and Cu-low molecular mass (Cu-LMM). In plasma, cases had significantly lower levels of Cu, but higher levels of Zn and Se than controls. In urine, cases had significantly higher levels of Cu and Zn, while the levels of Se, Co, and Mo were significantly lower than in controls. Therapy with ZnSO<sub>4</sub> led to higher plasma Zn and Se levels, and higher urine Zn levels, while chelating agent therapy increased urine Cu levels. Among the three Cu species in both cases and controls, the proportion of Cu-Cp was the most dominant, followed by Cu-HSA and Cu-LMM. Long-term drug therapy led to a decline or loss of Cu-HSA and Cu-LMM fractions, offering opportunities for potential plasma biomarkers of WD. Overall, this study provides new insight into the levels of essential trace elements in the plasma and urine of WD-treated cases, the impact of drug therapy on the alteration of specific trace elements and three major species of Cu, potential new biomarkers, and the implications for careful monitoring of drug therapy in WD patients."

This study aimed to analyze the neurological outcomes of patients with neuroWD who underwent liver transplantation (LT) as a rescue therapy for neurological deterioration (Brain group), and to compare them with those who underwent LT for end-stage liver disease (ESLD) (Liver group). A systematic PubMed search identified studies on neuroWD and LT published from January 1973 to January 2024. A total of 368 patients with neuroWD were identified, including 89 and 279 in the Brain and Liver groups, respectively. Post-LT survival rates were similar between groups (82 % vs. 86.6 %). Sepsis was the primary cause of death in both groups (68.7 % in the Brain group vs. 57.1 % in the Liver group). Among survivors beyond 1 year, 86.3 % in the Brain group and 79.7 % in the Liver group showed improvement or complete recovery from neuroWD. De novo post-LT neurological complications and calcineurin inhibitors-induced neurotoxicity were reported exclusively in the Liver group (p < 0.05). LT is a viable option for neuroWD unresponsive to medical therapy. Delayed introduction or early minimization of calcineurin inhibitors is recommended for ESLD patients to reduce neurotoxicity. Further studies are needed to confirm these observations, as there are currently no evidence-based medicine criteria or standardized inclusion scales for LT in cases of neuro-WD."

Circulation of these viruses is associated with spillover infections in multiple species of mammals, including a large, unprecedented outbreak in American dairy cattle. Before widespread on-farm testing, there was an unmet need for genomic surveillance. Infected cattle can shed high amounts of HPAI H5N1 viruses in milk, allowing detection in pasteurized retail dairy samples. Over a 2-month sampling period in one Midwestern city, we obtained dairy products processed in 20 different states. Here we demonstrate that a tiled-amplicon sequencing approach produced over 90% genome coverage at greater than 20x depth from 5 of 13 viral RNA positive samples, with higher viral copies corresponding to better sequencing success. The sequences clustered phylogenetically within the rest of the cattle outbreak sequences reported.

During learning, neural selectivity in place- and, to a lesser extent, face-selective regions was greater for subsequently remembered than forgotten events; positively scaled with variability in dorsal attention network activity, within and across individuals; and negatively related to AD pathology, evidenced by elevated plasma phosphorylated Tau<sub>181</sub> (pTau<sub>181</sub>). Path analysis revealed that neural selectivity mediated the effects of age, attention, and pTau<sub>181</sub> on memory. These data reveal multiple pathways that contribute to memory differences among older adults-AD-independent reductions in top-down attention and AD-related pathology alter the precision of cortical representations of events during experience, with consequences for remembering."

To assess the cost effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination programs, where eligibility is defined by combinations of age and chronic medical conditions, including a strategy similar to current Canadian recommendations. Static, individual-based, probabilistic cost-utility model economic evaluation parameterized with recent data describing COVID-19 epidemiology, vaccine characteristics, and costs. The analysis used a 15-month time horizon from July 2024 to September 2025 and a modeled cohort of 1 million people with characteristics based on the Canadian population, stratified by age group and presence or absence of at least 1 chronic medical condition. Annual or biannual COVID-19 vaccination strategies offered to different age and medical risk groups, with annual vaccination occurring in October and November in the primary analysis. Medically attended SARS-CoV-2 infections treated in outpatient and inpatient settings, including post-COVID condition cases and deaths. Costs in 2023 Canadian dollars, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), discounted at 1.5% for the health system and societal perspectives. Among 1 million simulated individuals, annual vaccination for adults aged 65 years and older consistently emerged as a cost-effective intervention, with ICERs less than CAD $50 000 per QALY compared with no vaccination for a range of model assumptions. Adding a second dose for adults aged 65 years and older or expanding programs to include vaccination for younger age groups, including those at higher risk of COVID-19 due to chronic medical conditions, generally resulted in ICERs greater than $50 000 per QALY. Shifting timing of vaccination programs to better align with periods of high COVID-19 case occurrence resulted in biannual vaccination for those aged 65 years and older being cost effective. In this economic evaluation of COVID-19 vaccination strategies, programs were observed to be cost effective when focused on groups at higher risk of disease. Optimal timing of programs improved the cost effectiveness of vaccination strategies. As COVID-19 transitioned to an endemic disease with high levels of population immunity, many jurisdictions revisited COVID-19 vaccination recommendations; these results identified COVID-19 vaccination programs that may provide good value for money."

Here, we further investigate the protective properties of WMP in a mouse model of colitis. An in vitro digested WMP (IVD-WMP) reduced permeability of intestinal epithelial Caco-2 and HT-29-MTX cell monolayers to FITC dextran. In vivo, WMP orally administered to mice as a pretreatment before induction of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis. Though statistically significant decreases in disease scores were not reported, we observed an antiinflammatory and antioxidative stress profile in the colon. Additionally, 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) microbiome analysis revealed differences in bacterial abundance associated with WMP pretreatment, including a decrease in Allobaculum species associated with inflammatory bowel disease. In a DSS-colitis recovery model, WMP promoted recovery as evidenced by improved weight gain, reduced stool scores, reduced IL-1Î² levels, and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity in colonic tissue. This work demonstrates the health benefits associated with the consumption of the white button mushroom, including support of intestinal barrier integrity combined with antioxidant and antiinflammatory activity."

The model combines brain T1WI MRI radiomics with clinical features and employs SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to interpret the contributions of the features. Automated segmentation techniques were used to delineate regions of interest (ROI) in routine brain T1WI MRI scans from 107 WD cases. Radiomics features were extracted and screened using LASSO regression. Six ML models were trained to develop a predictive model for symptom deterioration during short-term anti-copper therapy. The SHAP method was applied to identify and explain the importance of the features in the ML models. Significant correlations were observed between UWDRS-N scores, Course of disease, age, and radiomics features of the brainstem, caudate, and corpus callosum (p < 0.05). The ML models incorporated 18 radiomics and 9 clinical features. Six ML models were used in the training and test set, the best performing model was XGBoost, with AUC values of 0.96 and 0.94, respectively. SHAP analysis revealed that the five most important features were the UWDRS-N score, age, right putamen GrayLevelNonUniformityNormalized, right caudate ZoneEntropy, and central corpus callosum SmallDependenceEmphasis. The SHAP force plot illustrated how the XGBoost model predicted neurological symptom deterioration at the patient level. An explainable XGBoost model was successfully developed using brain T1WI MRI radiomics and clinical features. This model identifies WD patients at risk of neurological symptom deterioration during anti-copper therapy and provides insight into the contributions of individual features."

    "title": "Pitfalls in the Diagnosis of Wilson Disease.",
    "abstract": "Wilson disease (WD), an uncommon autosomal recessive (AR) hereditary disorder characterized by abnormal accumulation of copper primarily in the liver and secondarily in other organs like the brain, is caused by a deficiency in the ATP7B transporter gene. The key to successful therapy is early diagnosis. Mutant genes need to be inherited from both parents for phenotypic expression. The ATP7B gene located on chromosome 13q14.3 comprises 20 introns and 21 exons, encodes a protein of 165 amino acids, and this helps in incorporation of copper into ceruloplasmin, the copper binding protein. So far, more than 800 mutations have been reported, of which 380 have confirmed involvement in the pathogenesis of WD. The most common mutations are H1069Q and R778L in European and Asian populations respectively. Approximately 90%-98% of WD subjects are heterozygous, showing different mutations in each of the alleles encoding the ATP7B. Conversely, the phenotype and the penetrance of WD can be extremely variable. Even patients carrying two disease-causing mutations do not necessarily have a demonstrable alteration of copper metabolism. Considering the possibility of late-onset disease, asymptomatic cases, and phenotypic variability, it is crucial to evaluate previous and future generations of the index case. WD ranges from being asymptomatic in some patients to result in acute liver failure and/or a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders among others. Although WD may be present at any age, is more common between the ages of 5 and 35 years. However, it should be investigated in patients with liver failure of unknown cause and those with liver disease associated with neuropsychiatric symptomatology. Diagnosis requires a combination of clinical signs and symptoms, as well as relevant diagnostic tests such as measurement of serum ceruloplasmin, urinary excretion of copper, liver biopsy or genetic testing. Treatment is lifelong and includes chelating agents (penicillamine and trientine) and inhibitors of copper absorption (zinc salts). Liver transplant is an option for patients with end-stage liver disease. The key to successful therapy is early diagnosis."

    "title": "Discriminating Disease Flare From Infection in Febrile Patients With Systemic Lupus Erythematosus in a Safety-Net Hospital System: A Multicenter Study.",
    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to assess clinical laboratory parameters that distinguish between disease flare and infection in febrile patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) at safety-net hospitals in Los Angeles. We reviewed electronic medical records of patients admitted from August 1, 2016, through July 31, 2019, categorizing them as disease flare, bacterial infection (culture positive), culture-negative infection, and both flare and infection. Laboratory parameters collected within 48 hours of admission (complete blood cell count with differential, liver function panel, erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR], C-reactive protein [CRP], C3, C4, lactate, procalcitonin, and ferritin) were analyzed. Several laboratory parameters significantly distinguished febrile patients with disease flare from those with infection. An optimized multivariable logistic regression model revealed that an elevated ESR:CRP ratio (>1.17), low white blood cell (WBC) count (<6.25 Ã 10<sup>9</sup>/L), low absolute neutrophil count (<5.55 Ã 10<sup>9</sup>/L), and low CRP (<113 mg/L), C3 (<44.5 mg/dL), and C4 (<13.5 mg/dL) levels helped discriminate disease flare from culture-positive infection. These laboratory parameters yielded areas under the receiving operating characteristic curve of 0.87 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.76-0.97) for flare versus culture-positive infection and 0.94 (95% CI 0.88-1.00) for flare versus culture-negative infection. These optimized models, using multiple laboratory parameters, significantly outperformed the ESR:CRP ratio alone (P < 0.02) in discriminating flare from infection. The ESR:CRP ratio plus C3 and C4 levels, WBC count, neutrophil count, and monocyte count discriminate flare from either culture-positive or culture-negative infection in febrile patients with SLE. Our findings warrant prospective validation."

    "abstract": "The relationship between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease and neurodegenerative effects is not fully understood. This study investigates neurodegeneration patterns across CSF Alzheimer's disease biomarker groups, the association of brain volumes with CSF amyloid and tau status and sex differences in these relationships in a clinical neurology sample. MRI and CSF Alzheimer's disease biomarkers data were analysed in 306 patients of the Mass General Brigham healthcare system aged 50+ (mean age = 68.4 Â± 8.8 years; 43.1% female), who had lumbar punctures within 1 year of clinical MRI scans. We first analysed neurodegeneration patterns across four biomarker groups: 60 controls (A-T-&CU; amyloid negative, tau negative, cognitively unimpaired), 25 A+T- (amyloid positive, tau negative), 121 A+T+ (amyloid positive, tau positive) and 100 other dementia (A-T-&CI; amyloid negative, tau negative, cognitively impaired). Second, we examined volumetric associations with amyloid (amyloid positive, tau negative versus control) and tau in the presence of amyloid (amyloid positive, tau positive versus amyloid positive, tau negative) across 52 brain areas. Third, we examined sex differences in these relationships. Finally, we validated core analyses across three independent datasets-NACC (National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center), ADNI (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative) and EPAD (European Prevention of Alzheimer's Dementia)-totalling 3137 participants, and performed meta-analyses to obtain more robust estimates. We observed distinct neurodegeneration patterns across biomarker groups, with disrupted connectivity (brain volume covariance networks) in amyloid positive and other dementia groups, while amyloid and tau negative, cognitively unimpaired controls exhibited the most connected network. Amyloid was associated with subcortical, cerebellar and brainstem atrophy, with consistent association observations in the thalamus and amygdala across all four datasets. Tau in the presence of amyloid demonstrated general brain shrinkage through enlargement of extracerebral CSF, alongside unexpected ventricle shrinkages. Sex-based analyses revealed that A+T+ (amyloid positive, tau positive) had lower sex differences in connectivity patterns compared with other groups. Sex differences were also noted in amyloid-related ventricular volume changes. This study reveals how amyloid and tau affect brain connectivity and volume across sex and CSF biomarker groups, emphasizing global brain changes and sex differences. By leveraging automated pipelines and advanced MRI and biomarker analyses, we extracted meaningful and replicable findings from heterogeneous clinical samples from real-world data. The meta-analyses across four datasets enhance the generalizability of our results."

    "abstract": "Aortic valve stenosis (AS) is the most common valvular disease, with a growing impact in the aging population. AS can culminate in heart failure if left untreated. Early treatment with minimally-invasive transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is being evaluated in clinical trials. We addressed an unmet clinical need for early detection, referral to echocardiography for AS evaluation, and possible treatments (e.g., lifestyle changes, drugs, or TAVR). As aortic valve calcification (AVC) is typically present in AS, we created a method to detect AVC in low-cost/no-cost non-contrast CT calcium score (CTCS) screening exam images. We developed a multi-task deep network to identify a cylindrical aortic valve region of interest (ROI) and applied Agatston criteria within the ROI to obtain calcifications. Predicted ROIs had good agreement with cardiologists' labels and sometimes were better. Predicted Agatston scores agreed with cardiologists (r=1.00, paired t-test p=0.573, t=0.57). On a retrospective screening cohort of 2000+ patients, we found that 20.6% of men and 22.2% of women had some degree of AVC. According to guidelines, 3.53% and 9.04%, respectively, would have severe AS. These promising results indicate that further evaluation of this approach is warranted, with the potential for significant public health impact."

    "abstract": "Autocidal mosquito control approaches are based on rearing mosquitoes in consistent and stable laboratory conditions; however, when adult mosquitoes are released in field settings, they have to rapidly respond to changes in temperature and thermal stress. To examine the effect of thermal stress on mosquitoes, <i>Aedes aegypti</i> and <i>Aedes albopictus</i> larvae were reared at either 22Â°C (R22) or 28Â°C (R28) and emerged adults were subsequently exposed to temperatures of 22 (E22), 28 (E28), 32 (E32), or 38Â°C (E38). After the mosquitoes were subjected to these altered temperature profiles, we examined for effects on adult survivorship, respiration rates, and heat shock protein (HSP) expression. Reduced adult survivorship was observed when the rearing temperature was different than the adult exposure temperature. Respiration rates as a measure of thermal stress varied with rearing conditions and exposure temperatures, with notable declines observed as exposure temperatures increased. HSP gene expression was generally upregulated in response to thermal stress, with specific patterns differing by species and rearing conditions. Wing length measurements revealed no significant developmental differences across rearing temperatures, except for <i>Ae. aegypti</i> females. These findings highlight the impact of temperature on mosquito physiology and the potential impacts of rearing and environmental temperatures on the effectiveness of autocidal approaches for mosquito and disease control."

    "abstract": "Maternal obesity during pregnancy significantly increases the offspring's risk of later-life cardiovascular disease. This study investigated cardiometabolic perturbations by utilizing a mouse model of maternal high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity that recapitulates metabolic abnormalities observed in humans. We report that offspring of HFD-fed mothers (Off-HFD) exhibit a progression of obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and metabolic inflexibility when compared with offspring of regular diet-fed mothers (Off-RD). Deeper investigation of cardiac function further identified significant functional, metabolic, and immune perturbations in adult offspring of mothers on HFD. Specifically, Off-HFD mice presented progressing cardiac hypertrophy with reduced ejection fraction, increased accumulation of fibrotic tissue, mitochondrial dysfunction, and altered immune complexity including increases in cardiac resident and infiltrated macrophages, and decreases in CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell subpopulations. While these alterations may not be immediately catastrophic, they likely predispose the offspring to heightened sensitivity to nutritional, psychological, or environmental stressors. Analysis of DNA methylation in the hearts of newly-weaned offspring from RD and HFD mothers revealed numerous differentially methylated CpGs and regions within genes associated with cardiac development, hypertrophy, mitochondrial function, and immune response. Thus, our study shows epigenetic remodeling early in development, which is likely responsible for the cardiovascular dysregulation observed in adult life. These findings uncover potential windows of opportunity for preventive therapy and early therapeutic interventions."

    "abstract": "An estimated 1 in 500 people live with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), a disease for which genetic diagnosis can identify family members at risk, and increasingly guide therapy. Mutations in the myosin binding protein C3 (<i>MYBPC3</i>) gene account for a significant proportion of HCM cases. However, many of these variants are classified as variants of uncertain significance (VUS), complicating clinical decision-making. Scalable methods for variant interpretation in disease-specific cell types are crucial for understanding variant impact and uncovering disease mechanisms. We developed a scaled multidimensional mapping strategy to evaluate the functional impact of variants across a critical domain of MYBPC3. We incorporate saturation base editing at the native <i>MYBPC3</i> locus, a long-read RNA sequencing-enabled assay of variant splice effects, and measurements of HCM-relevant phenotypes, including MYBPC3 abundance, hypertrophic signaling, and ubiquitin-proteasome function in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs). Our multidimensional mapping strategy enabled high-resolution functional analysis of <i>MYBPC3</i> variants in iPSC-CMs. Targeted transient base editing generated a comprehensive variant library at the native locus, capturing diverse variant effects on cellular HCM-relevant phenotypes. Our massively parallel splicing assay identified novel splice-disrupting variants. Integration of functional assays revealed that decreased MYBPC3 abundance is a key driver of HCM-related phenotypes. In parallel, downregulation of protein degradation was observed as a compensatory response to MYBPC3 loss of function, and novel disease mechanisms were identified for missense variants near a critical binding domain, underscoring their contribution to pathogenesis. Bayesian estimates of variant effects enable the reclassification of clinical variants. This work provides a platform for extending genome engineering in iPSCs to multiplexed assays of variant effects across diverse disease-relevant cellular phenotypes, enhancing the understanding of variant pathogenicity and uncovering novel biological mechanisms that could inform therapeutic strategies."

    "abstract": "Chronic low back pain, frequently associated with intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration, is highly prevalent in individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD), and the pain intensity is highly correlated with the degree of cognitive impairment. While the incidences of both afflictions increase dramatically in the elderly population, it is unknown whether AD exacerbates the health of the IVD. Utilizing one-year-old male and female 5xFAD mice that constitutively express human APP and PSEN1 transgenes with five AD-linked mutations, we measured the lumbar IVD's extracellular matrix composition, the three-dimensional structure, histopathological degeneration, and mechanical behavior. The collagen, glycosaminoglycans, and advanced glycation end-products content of the IVD were not appreciably different between the 5xFAD animals and their wild-type littermates. Likewise, the 5xFAD IVDs were not histopathologically degenerated. However, the IVD volume, measured by contrast-enhanced microCT, was larger in the 5xFAD animals. Furthermore, dynamic microcompression revealed that 5xFAD IVDs exhibited higher loss tangent, indicating altered tissue damping and fluid-flow dynamics within the disc. These results suggest that although the IVDs of mice with AD are not more degenerated, they may be more susceptible to damage accumulation due to the elevated absorption of energy. Elderly individuals with AD may thus be more prone to IVD injuries that lead to eventual degeneration and spinal pain. Future work will focus on defining the molecular mechanisms and the consequences of these mechanical and structural changes in the IVD and their consequences to low back pain in individuals with AD."

We therefore investigated the effects of ATP7B (ATPase copper-transporting beta) deficiency and/or a high-fat diet (HFD) on the development of steatohepatitis in mouse models and examined the relationship of hepatic steatosis with cardiometabolic factors in WD patients. A retrospective analysis of data was conducted on adults with WD. Atp7b gene knockout (KO) was achieved by CRISPR/Cas9 technology, followed by a comprehensive phenotypic analysis. An HFD was administered to induce steatohepatitis, allowing for analysis of lipid metabolism and hepatic injuries in KO mice subjected to overnutrition. Of 61 WD patients, 11.5% had evidence of hepatic steatosis, significantly linked to cardiometabolic factors. Although ATP7B KO mice under normal diets exhibited significant copper metabolism disorders without overt hepatic or neurologic injury, steatohepatitis was successfully induced in both wild-type and KO mice after 24 weeks of an HFD. Compared with a normal diet, an HFD resulted in markedly decreased hepatic copper levels with obvious liver injury in KO mice. Moreover, HFD-fed KO mice exhibited significantly higher severity of hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis than wild-type control mice. Results suggest that hepatic steatosis in WD relates more to acquired metabolic dysfunction than excess copper accumulation, underscoring the influence of nutritional excess on WD phenotypes."

    "abstract": "Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive breast cancer subtype that disproportionately impacts Black women and has limited effective therapeutic options. Consequently, there is an urgent need to develop novel approaches for the treatment of TNBC. Previously, we identified monopolar spindle kinase I (Mps1 or TTK), which is upregulated in TNBC patients after radiotherapy, as a potential therapeutic target. We found that TTK inhibition sensitizes human TNBC to radiotherapy (RT) both in vitro and in vivo; however, these studies were performed in immunodeficient models. Here, we extended those studies into syngeneic murine models of TNBC using two TTK inhibitors: empesertib and the novel TTK inhibitor CFI-402257 (also known as luvixasertib) that was recently granted FDA fast track approval in breast cancer. These studies demonstrate that TTK inhibition radiosensitizes syngeneic murine models of TNBC and increases the production of micronuclei and aneuploidy. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that TTK inhibition and RT alter the tumor immune microenvironment of TNBC by modifying the production of antitumoral type I interferon (T1IFN). In vivo, TTK inhibition sensitizes syngeneic models of TNBC to RT. Furthermore, combining TTK inhibition and RT also potentiates T1IFN signaling, suggesting that combination treatment may induce antitumoral immunity in immunocompetent models. Taken together, these studies demonstrate that TTK inhibition enhances radiosensitivity and TTK inhibition with RT modulates the immune landscape of TNBC. Collectively, this combination may represent a novel therapeutic strategy to improve outcomes for patients with TNBC by both direct tumor cytotoxicity and by promoting an immune-responsive environment."

    "abstract": "While it can be rewarding to provide care for a person with serious illness, care partners are often unprepared to manage and cope with the physical and emotional stresses that arise with disease progression and bereavement. We aimed to evaluate membership enrollment, engagement, and experiences within a web-based peer support network for active and bereaved care partners of people with serious illness. We conducted a formative evaluation of the ConnectShareCare peer-to-peer web-based support network, which targeted care partners of people with serious illness residing in the northeastern United States. Recruitment methods included marketing postcards, flyers, listserv messages, and referrals from community stakeholders, peers, and clinicians. Enrollment occurred through a self-guided, web-based process. Study participants included members enrolled in ConnectShareCare between April 2021 and June 2023. We used the network's analytics dashboard (eg, registration, usage, and notification logs) to evaluate membership enrollment and engagement in discussions. We used surveys of a subset of members to assess experiences, including satisfaction, ability to find meaning by supporting others, and value and opportunities for improvement. Over 2 years, the network enrolled 250 members, with an average of 9 new members per month. Among 193 members providing information, most (58%, n=112) identified as active care partners, 17% (n=33) identified as bereaved care partners, and 27% (n=52) chose not to specify their role. Two-thirds of the 250 members did not post, 20% (n=50) posted 1-10 times, 6% (n=14) posted 11-25 times, 6% (n=15) posted 26-100 times, and 3% (n=7) posted more than 100 times. On average, 19 members posted per month resulting in 166 member posts per month. Moderators (1 community manager, 2 volunteer mentors, and 2 project team members) supported members with an average of 111 posts/month. In total, 187 discussion topics were created, including 42% (n=78) started by members and 58% (n=109) started by moderators. Seventy-eight discussion topics had 10 or more posts associated with them. The most frequent discussion topics focused on \"check-ins\" and \"sources of joy and hope.\" Among 18 care partner members who completed a research survey, 69% (11/16) reported connecting with at least 1 person and 62% (10/16) reported that ConnectShareCare helped them find meaning and purpose by supporting others. Most reported satisfaction with support (12/16, 75%) and information (14/16, 88%) through the network. Although most noted that ConnectShareCare was easy to use (10/17, 59%), respondents were less likely to easily find the information they were seeking (6/16, 38%). Survey respondents found value in peer connection and support and identified opportunities to improve navigation of resources and engagement of members. Care partners of people with serious illness can use a web-based peer support network to find meaningful and useful support and information. Additional work is needed to identify the impact of the network on distress, social connectivity, and support programming."

    "abstract": "Intercellular interactions among cardiac cell populations are essential for cardiac morphogenesis, yet the molecular mechanisms orchestrating these events remain incompletely understood. Dachsous1 (Dchs1), an atypical cadherin linked to mitral valve prolapse, is a core planar cell polarity protein whose function in the developing heart has not been fully elucidated. To address this, we generated a Dchs1-HA knock-in mouse model to define its spatial, temporal, and cellular expression patterns. Using immunohistochemistry, western blotting, and single-cell transcriptomics across developmental stages, we demonstrate that cardiac Dchs1 expression is restricted to non-cardiomyocyte lineages. DCHS1 displays dynamic subcellular localization and tissue organization depending on the developmental timepoint, with staining being found in epicardial and endocardial surfaces at earlier embryonic stages and in the compact myocardium in later fetal and neonatal stages. During fetal and neonatal stages, DCHS1-positive non-myocyte, non-endothelial cells form polarized extensions that bridge endothelial and non-myocyte, non-endothelial cells, suggesting direct heterotypic and homotypic interactions. Western blotting revealed evidence of DCHS1 proteolytic cleavage, with intracellular C-terminal fragments. RNA co-expression with its binding partner FAT4 supports a conserved, non-myocyte-specific DCHS1-FAT4 signaling axis. These findings identify DCHS1 as a potential molecular tether that is utilized in intercellular communications during cardiac development, with implications for congenital and acquired heart disease."

    "abstract": "Dystonin (DST) encodes three major isoforms, DST-a, DST-b, and DST-e. Biallelic pathogenic variants in DST have previously been associated with two allelic monogenic disorders: Hereditary Sensory and Autonomic Neuropathy type VI (caused by a loss of DST-a) and Epidermolysis bullosa simplex 3 (caused by a loss of DST-e). We investigated patients diagnosed with congenital myopathy using exome or genome sequencing. In 19 affected individuals from 14 unrelated families, we identified nine different variants in biallelic state located in exons 40-41, specific to DST-b. Affected individuals presented with severe neonatal myopathy characterized by arthrogryposis, hypotonia, and dilated cardiomyopathy. Postnatal CPAP ventilation was required in nine patients, and seven died within the first three years of life. Survivors showed an improvement of symptoms, with the oldest three patients, now over 25 years old, exhibiting normal cognition and being ambulatory. RNA analyses demonstrated that transcripts encoding DST-b are predominantly expressed in skeletal muscle, heart tissue, and cultured fibroblasts, but not in brain matching the phenotypic spectrum. Patient-derived fibroblasts exhibited reduced DST mRNA expression. Proteomic analysis confirmed a reduction of DST protein levels due to an absence of the DST-b isoform. Muscle biopsies from four patients aged 1 month to 3 years revealed mild, non-specific myopathic changes. Ultrastructural analysis in three individuals showed mild and focal myofibrillar disruption and non-specific undulating nuclear membranes, with these changes observed in two cases each. Additionally, we identified two homozygous variants affecting both DST-a and DST-b isoforms in four patients from two unrelated families; all presented with severe arthrogryposis and died intrauterine or shortly after birth. Genotype-Phenotype correlation in these patients and previously published cases with respective variants resulted in the definition of a DST-associated lethal congenital contracture syndrome. Our findings demonstrate that biallelic variants exclusively affecting DST-b cause an autosomal recessive congenital myopathy. Variants that also impact DST-a besides DST-b result in a more severe, lethal congenital contracture syndrome. The location of the variant within DST allows for phenotype prediction. We propose redefining DST as a disease-associated gene linked to four distinct allelic disease phenotypes."

This cross-sectional pilot study included 47 young adults between the ages of 18-28 and their informants (e.g., parents, partners, siblings). Participants were followed by pediatric rehabilitation clinics for acquired brain injury (ABI = 16), neuromuscular disorders (NMD = 22), or spina bifida (SB = 9). Informants completed the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Functions - Adult Version, from which we reported the General Executive Composite. To assess medical self-management, young adult participants completed the Transition Readiness Assessment Questionnaire (TRAQ). Using generalized linear regression with the TRAQ as the dependent measure, better informant-rated executive functioning skills were associated with more favorable ratings of healthcare self-management with a large effect size (Î² = -0.62, p < .001). With a small effect size, there was also a main effect of participant race and ethnicity (Î² = 0.27, p = .049). Marginalized identities, specifically identification as of Indigenous and Black races, were associated with poorer ratings of healthcare self-management skills. Lower executive functioning skills and some marginalized identities are linked to poorer healthcare self-management in this sample of TAA with pediatric-onset disabilities. These findings highlight the value of neuropsychologists in identifying cognitive challenges and implementing targeted interventions in the context of social determinants of health."

Clinical data from 20 patients with claustrum sign were collected. The clinical characteristics, neuroimaging evolution, and outcomes were analyzed. This cohort included 14 males and 6 females and the median age of onset was 6 years old. Diagnoses included febrile infection-related epilepsy syndrome (FIRES) in 12 cases (60%), antibody-negative autoimmune encephalitis (AbNAE) in 4 (20%), myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated disease (MOGAD) in 3 (15%), and Wilson's disease (WD) in 1 (5%). Predominant neurological symptoms included seizures (85%) and impaired consciousness (70%). The claustrum sign was observed on days 1-25 (median: day 11.5) after the onset of neurologic symptoms. It presented on the first MRI between days 1 and 14 (median: day 5.5) in 8 cases (40%), while it was absent on the first MRI (days 1-7, median: day 3) in the remaining 12 cases (60%) and appeared on the repeated MRIs (days 6-25, median: day 15). On the follow-up MRIs in 19 cases, the claustrum sign resolved on days 16-132 (median: day 53) in 17 patients, except one with AbNAE and one with WD. The patients with FIRES had the worst prognosis, all developed chronic epilepsy, 75% showed poor memory and calculation, and the median Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category (PCPC) score was 3. In contrast, patients with AbNAE and MOGAD had favorable outcomes with a median PCPC score of 1, respectively. The claustrum sign may represent a transient neuroinflammatory lesion and serve as an imaging marker of neuroinflammation. Lesions in the claustrum can lead to dysfunction of its connected regions, which could be one of the potential mechanisms underlying the high incidence of seizures and the impaired consciousness in children with this imaging feature. Long-term outcomes are closely related to the primary disease."

The average serum ceruloplasmin and urinary copper levels improved in most patients, with values of 15.6 mg/dL and 32.3 Âµg per 24 h, respectively. For pediatric patients with Wilson's disease, the survival rates at 6 months, 1 year, and 3 years were 97.0%, 96%, and 94.5%, and in adult patients achieved survival rates of 100%, 100%, and 75% at 6 months, 1 year, and 3 years, respectively. LT is considered as a principal therapeutic option with good long-term results in Wilson patients, even in those presenting with hepatic failure. Neurologic manifestations have been improved post-LT; however, de novo neuropsychiatric symptoms begin in some cases after successful liver transplantation."

    "title": "Navigating Endoscopic Surveillance and Management of Barrett's Esophagus in Elderly Patients: Balancing the Risks and Benefits.",
    "abstract": "This review examines the current evidence and practical considerations for endoscopic surveillance of Barrett's esophagus (BE) in elderly patients, focusing on balancing the potential benefits and risks associated with endoscopic surveillance and eradication therapies in this population. Elderly patients with BE have a higher baseline prevalence of dysplasia and esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). Additionally, the risk of progression from BE to EAC increases with advancing age, making surveillance particularly relevant in this population. However, recent studies suggest the benefits of surveillance decline with increasing age, greater comorbidities, and reduced life expectancy. Despite increasing awareness that ongoing surveillance endoscopy may be of minimal benefit for certain patient groups, there remains a paucity of data to guide decisions regarding discontinuation of surveillance. The management of BE in elderly patients requires a careful balance between the potential benefits of endoscopic surveillance and eradication therapies and the risks and costs associated with repeated invasive procedures. Decisions to continue endoscopic surveillance in this population should be individualized, taking into account life-expectancy and comorbidities rather than focusing solely on chronological age."

    "abstract": "Evidence on degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) has frequently focussed on surgical management, overlooking the role of non-surgical clinicians. Their contributions in the patient journey remain largely underexplored in the literature. What is the role of non-surgical clinicians in the assessment and management of people with DCM? This narrative review synthesizes knowledge from a comprehensive MEDLINE search and the collective expertise of the RECODE-DCM Peri-Operative Rehabilitation Incubator, an expert working group hosted by Myelopathy.org. Key domains of non-surgical clinician involvement include: 1) early recognition and referral, 2) patient education, 3) pain management, 4) preoperative management, and 5) postoperative rehabilitation. Timely DCM diagnosis depends on first-contact clinicians recognizing hallmark symptoms. In the absence of standardized screening criteria, tools like the modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association score can support early identification. Non-surgical clinicians educate patients with mild or non-myelopathic spinal cord compression to recognize signs of DCM progression, ensuring timely surgical consultation. These clinicians also play a multidisciplinary role in the biopsychosocial management of pain, incorporating pharmacological and non-pharmacological strategies to address nociceptive and neuropathic pain. While predictors of postoperative outcomes, such as disease severity, gait dysfunction and smoking, are known, evidence on preoperative optimization and prehabilitation remains limited. Emerging research highlights the benefits of early postoperative rehabilitation, including cervical range of motion and stabilization exercises, in improving 12-month postoperative outcomes. Non-surgical clinicians play an integral role in DCM management across the care continuum. A multidisciplinary, patient-centred approach is essential. Postoperative rehabilitation holds promise, but prospective trials are necessary to establish standardization and optimal strategies for clinical delivery."

    "abstract": "Rare diseases have become a global public health challenge due to their low prevalence, difficult diagnosis, and limited treatment options. Intractable diseases are more common but often involve complex mechanisms, treatment with limited efficacy, and high medical costs, placing a heavy burden on patients and healthcare systems. In recent years, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has demonstrated unique advantages in the treatment of intractable and rare diseases and has gradually become an important complementary treatment. The current work is a systematic review of the progress of clinical and experimental research on TCM in typical rare diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, aplastic anemia (AA), and Wilson's disease (WD). It focuses on the multi-target therapeutic mechanisms of key Chinese herbal compound formulas, including immune regulation, antioxidative stress, and neuroprotection. The core TCM theories of \"syndrome differentiation\", \"different treatments for the same disease\" and the \"same treatment for different diseases\" are also discussed in the context of personalized medicine. In recent years, China has continuously promoted the development of TCM through a series of national plans and supportive policies, such as the 14th Five-Year Plan for TCM development, funding for key special projects, expedited approval pathways, and expanded coverage by medical insurance. These efforts have provided strong support for the clinical translation of TCM and technological innovation in the field of intractable and rare diseases. Notwithstanding the encouraging advances, the field of Chinese medicine continues to grapple with numerous challenges. In the future, the enhancement of mechanistic studies and quality multicenter clinical trials needs to be promoted while further enhancing policy support and international collaboration to substantiate the scientific basis and clinical value of TCM in the prevention and treatment of intractable and rare diseases."

    "abstract": "Type 1 diabetes is a chronic autoimmune disease that often presents with diabetic ketoacidosis at diagnosis. Since detection of type 1 diabetes risk is possible using genetic risk scores and autoantibody assays, prevention of diabetic ketoacidosis or delayed onset of type 1 diabetes may be possible and may improve outcomes. Several pilot screening programmes for type 1 diabetes risk have emerged worldwide but outcomes measured in these screening programmes are heterogeneous, making it difficult to compare and synthesise findings across studies. To improve the standardisation of outcome reporting and measurement, we aim to develop a patient-oriented core outcome set for studies of type 1 diabetes risk screening. This five-step protocol was developed in alignment with the COS-STAndardised Protocol Statement and the Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials framework. The five steps will include: (1a) conducting a rapid literature review, (1b) gathering input on candidate outcomes from members of the public, (2) combining literature and public input to prepare a preliminary list of outcomes, (3) conducting Delphi surveys with a range of stakeholders to begin to establish consensus on outcomes, (4) holding a final consensus meeting to establish consensus on outcomes and (5) establishing the outcome measurement instruments for the core outcome set. Ethics approval has been provided by The Hospital for Sick Children Research Ethics Board. The core outcome set will be distributed to researchers and clinicians involved in diabetes screening and clinical care, patient and family networks, research funders, journal editors, public health experts, and policymakers. Disseminated materials will be tailored to the various end users in the form of publication through academic journals, policy briefs, conferences, educational webinars, websites and social media."

    "abstract": "Circulatory deficits are common and pathophysiologically relevant in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Perturbed red blood cell (RBC) homeostasis and diminished nitric oxide (NO) availability contribute to endothelial dysfunction, a hallmark of cardiometabolic disorders; however, underlying pathophysiological mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we investigated RBC signaling pathways in a murine model of metabolic disease, focused on NO. T2DM-RBCs had elevated levels of cytosolic NO, intracellular calcium ions (Ca<sup>2+</sup>), and reactive oxygen species. Acute stimulation with exogenous insulin had no effect on NO content. Whereas insulin exposure caused Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry into healthy RBCs, T2DM-RBCs were insensitive. Using RBCs isolated from human blood, we confirmed that insulin had no effect on RBC-NO, despite prompting Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake. Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake with insulin exposure was sensitive to inhibition of mechanosensitive ion channels, as well as Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelation. Furthermore, co-incubation of RBCs with the piezo-type mechanosensitive ion channel component 1 (Piezo1) channel agonist Yoda1 and insulin did not produce compounded Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake, raising the possibility of crosstalk between insulin and Piezo1. The hyperinsulinemia associated with T2DM may exacerbate normal Piezo1-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake into RBCs, contributing to RBC dysfunction and circulatory complications in T2DM. The significance of RBC signaling in the pathophysiology of cardiometabolic disorders is still emerging. Individuals carrying mutations in the PIEZO1 gene exhibit hematological aberrations and hereditary anemia, supporting the importance of Piezo1 in RBC homeostasis. Furthermore, a shift in RBC-NO metabolism favoring nitrosative stress may contribute to circulatory complications observed in metabolic diseases such as T2DM. Collectively, the emerging relevance of RBC signaling pathways may provide novel avenues for targeted drug development."

    "abstract": "Monitoring Wilson disease (WD) is challenging due to its variable presentation and the absence of reliable biomarkers. This study aims to assess the predictive value of liver enzymes, particularly transaminases, on long-term outcomes in patients with hepatic WD using data from the Spanish Wilson Registry. We analysed data from 162 WD patients with hepatic involvement and over one year of follow-up. Patients were classified as mild (no cirrhosis) or severe (with cirrhosis) at diagnosis. An \"unstable pattern of transaminases\" was defined as recurrent AST or ALT elevations. Unfavourable outcomes included new cirrhosis, elastography progression > 2 Kpa, liver transplant, or liver-related deaths. Logistic regression models were used to evaluate the impact of various factors on disease outcome. Of 162 patients, 81.5% had mild disease at diagnosis. Most received chelators as first-line therapy, achieving an 81.4% one-year biochemical response. After a median follow-up of 17 years, 59% exhibited an unstable transaminase pattern, and 29% had an unfavourable outcome. Key factors associated with poor outcome included older age at diagnosis (OR = 1.03), lack of early biochemical response (OR = 0.19), advanced disease markers (platelet count, albumin), and an unstable transaminase pattern (OR = 2.92). Transaminase levels did not predict outcomes based on initial disease severity. Even patients with mild disease at diagnosis and persistently normal transaminases could experience progression over time, underscoring the need for more thorough follow-up evaluations. While transaminases are valuable for monitoring WD, they should be used alongside other biomarkers to better predict disease progression."

We assessed the effect of orforglipron in participants with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and/or overweight or obesity on blood pressure, lipid, and inflammatory biomarkers associated with risk for major adverse cardiovascular events. Using data from participants with available samples from Phase 2 trials of orforglipron in participants with T2D (N = 361) or with overweight or obesity without diabetes mellitus (N = 234), we performed an exploratory analysis of changes in CV risk markers. For the T2D study, participants mean age 59 years, 40% were assigned female at birth with a mean HbA<sub>1c</sub> of 8.1% and mean BMI of 35.3 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; they received once daily orforglipron doses (3, 12, 24, 36, or 45 mg) or once weekly subcutaneous dulaglutide 1.5 mg, or placebo.

Significant placebo-adjusted decreases from baseline in blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, ApoB, ApoC3, and hsCRP were observed following orforglipron treatment in participants with T2D and/or overweight or obesity. In both studies, improvements in blood pressure, lipid parameters, and most of the evaluated biomarkers were of similar magnitude after treatment with 12 mg orforglipron as with 24, 36, and 45 mg.

Comprehensive genomic profiling was initiated to aid in diagnosis, prognostication, treatment, and detection of germline disease predisposition in this patient cohort. Enhanced exome sequencing of disease and comparator tissue was coupled with RNA sequencing of the disease-involved specimen to assess for single nucleotide variation, insertion/deletions, copy number alteration, structural variation, fusions, and methylation profiling-based tumor classification scores. Among 317 patients who consented to the protocol, 39 (12%) had infantile cancers diagnosed at â¤1 year of age. Germline genetic alteration was frequent with 11 of 39 patients (28%) harboring a pathogenic change. Clinically relevant findings affecting diagnosis, prognosis, therapy, or surveillance were identified in 37 of 39 (95%) patients. Our data support that a pediatric cohort gains significant benefit from a comprehensive profiling approach, with a high yield of clinically significant findings. Nearly half of the infants in this cancer cohort harbored tumors potentially susceptible to therapeutic targets on the basis of genomic profile, and among these, another half sought benefit from therapeutic implementation."

    "abstract": "Copper, an indispensable trace element in living organisms, plays a pivotal role in human physiological processes. Wilson's disease (WD), an inherited disorder of copper metabolism, is caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene. This genetic malfunction disrupts the dynamics of copper transport and metabolism, thereby impairing ceruloplasmin synthesis and copper excretion. The resultant accumulation of copper in various tissues and organs precipitates a cascade of cellular demise and functional impairment. Notably, cuproptosis, a recently discovered copperâdependent regulated cell death mechanism, distinctly deviates from conventional cell death paradigms. This novel mode of cell death involves the interaction of copper with lipoacylated proteins within the tricarboxylic acid cycle, leading to proteinotoxic stress and culminating in cell death. In the realm of pathophysiology, cuproptosis has emerged as a pivotal player in a spectrum of diseases, with WD standing as a paradigm closely intertwined with the dysregulation of copper metabolism. This study aimed to encapsulate the pivotal molecular underpinnings of cuproptosis and delve into its crucial involvement in the etiopathogenesis of WD. By elucidating these mechanisms, the present analysis contributes significantly to the nuanced understanding of the pathological underpinnings of WD, thereby providing fresh insights and evidence that may direct innovative therapeutic strategies for this condition."

This retrospective cohort study examined trends in survival, stage distribution, and treatment utilization for breast cancer in Brazil, an upper middle-income country. Patients newly diagnosed with invasive breast cancer between 2000 and 2019 were identified from SÃ£o Paulo's Oncocenter Foundation registry. Data on demographics, diagnosis stage, diagnosis-to-treatment intervals, and treatments received were analyzed in 5-year blocks. Median overall survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Actual treatment utilization was compared to model-based estimates of optimal utilization derived from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network Guidelines' Enhanced and Maximal Resource Modules. We included 125,005 patients, with a median age at diagnosis of 55 years (interquartile range 46-75); 99.4% (n = 124,218) were female. The proportion with early disease remained stable over time (61.7% in 2000-2004, 62.4% 2015-2019). Median overall survival increased from 10.7 years (2000-2004) to 11.7 years (2010-2014); median survival for 2015-2019 was not reached. Median overall survival was 20.8, 15.1, 6.8, and 2.0 years for stages I-IV, respectively. Median diagnosis-to-treatment interval more than doubled over time. From 2000 to 2004 to 2015-2019, chemotherapy use decreased from 71.5% to 68.9%; radiotherapy use decreased from 64.0% to 56.5%, and surgery utilization decreased from 80.3% to 74.8%; endocrine therapy use varied between 54% and 62%. Gaps between observed and model-based estimates of treatment utilization were seen across all stages. Overall survival in patients with breast cancer in SÃ£o Paulo has improved over time.

Recently, large datasets that include genetic data and OSA status became available, providing an opportunity to utilise PGS approaches to study the genetic relationship between OSA and other phenotypes, while differentiating OSA-specific from obesity-specific genetic factors. Using race/ethnic diverse samples from over 1.2 million individuals from the Million Veteran Program, FinnGen, TOPMed, All of Us (AoU), Geisinger's MyCode, MGB Biobank, and the Human Phenotype Project, we developed and assessed PGSs for OSA, both without (BMIunadjOSA-PGS) and with adjustment for the genetic contributions of BMI (BMIadjOSA-PGS). Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for OSA per 1 standard deviation of the PGSs ranged from 1.38 to 2.75. The associations of BMIadjOSA- and BMIunadjOSA-PGSs with CVD outcomes in AoU shared both common and distinct patterns. Only BMIunadjOSA-PGS was associated with type 2 diabetes, heart failure, and coronary artery disease, while both BMIadjOSA- and BMIunadjOSA-PGSs were associated with hypertension and stroke. Sex stratified analyses revealed that BMIadjOSA-PGS association with hypertension was driven by females (OR = 1.1, p-value = 0.002, OR = 1.01 p-value = 0.2 in males). OSA PGSs were also associated with body fat measures with some sex-specific associations. Distinct components of OSA genetic risk are related and independent of obesity. Sex-specific associations with body fat distribution measures may explain differing OSA risks and associations with cardiometabolic morbidities between sexes. R01AG080598."

To investigate the epidemiology of iciHHV-6 in the UK, almost 32,000 individuals were screened from two volunteer research studies: the family-based Generation Scotland: Scottish Family Health Study (GS:SFHS) and the Breakthrough Generations Study (BGS). iciHHV-6 prevalence in GS:SFHS was, to our knowledge, higher than that in other large studies at 2.74% (647/23,637), with an iciHHV-6B prevalence of 2.55%. Scottish participants were more likely to be iciHHV-6B-positive than English (<i>P</i> < 0.001), and the BGS results suggested a north-south gradient of iciHHV-6B prevalence in mainland Britain. Disease association analysis confirmed the previously reported association with angina, with an odds ratio of 1.91 (95% confidence interval, 1.29, 2.82) following adjustment for known risk factors, providing compelling evidence that iciHHV-6 contributes to the risk of a common symptom. <i>De novo</i> integrations were not detected within GS:SFHS pedigrees; rather, our findings indicated that three viral lineages accounted for over 95% of iciHHV-6A-positive samples, and six viral lineages accounted for 90% of iciHHV-6B-positive samples in GS:SFHS. This study demonstrates that iciHHV-6 is common in the UK, shows significant regional heterogeneity in prevalence, is not entirely harmless, and is largely derived from a relatively small number of ancestral viral lineages.IMPORTANCEHuman herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) has the unusual ability to integrate into the host chromosome telomeres. Most of the world's population is infected by HHV-6 in early childhood, but around 1% inherit the virus as a chromosomally integrated viral genome-referred to as inherited chromosomally integrated HHV-6 (iciHHV-6). Little is known about the consequences of iciHHV-6, which has the potential to cause disease through various mechanisms. Here, we have used large cohorts to study iciHHV-6 prevalence, lineages, and phenotypic associations. We replicate a previously reported association between iciHHV-6 and angina, suggesting that iciHHV-6 is not entirely benign. We show significant variation in iciHHV-6 prevalence within the UK with almost 3% of Scottish people carrying iciHHV-6. In the first detailed analysis of viral lineages at the population level, we show that 90% of iciHHV-6 is explained by nine ancestral viral lineages. These results have important implications for future disease association analyses."

    "abstract": "The selection of the optimal treatment strategy remains one of the most challenging decisions in the management of coronary artery disease (CAD). Surgical and percutaneous coronary revascularisation are two widely used treatments for managing CAD and can result in improved outcomes compared with medications alone. Current practice guidelines recommend revascularisation for multivessel CAD for most patients. However, there remains uncertainty about whether revascularisation or medical therapy is optimal for managing multivessel disease for many patients, especially, in the elderly and those living with multimorbidity. Also, there is limited understanding of patient preferences towards candidate treatment options for multivessel disease. This study aims to quantify and characterise heterogeneity in patient preferences towards treatment options for multivessel CAD. We have designed and will administer a discrete choice experiment to elicit and quantify preferences of people with multivessel CAD towards revascularisation and optimal medical therapy for managing multivessel CAD. Multinomial logit mixed effects and hierarchical Bayes models will be used to model the association between the participants' choices and the attributes and their different levels. The relative importance of the attributes will be assessed using the size of coefficients and marginal rate of substitution (MRS), a measure of the willingness to accept a trade-off among different options. Heterogeneity in patient preferences will be evaluated using latent class analysis. Ethical approval for this study was granted by the University of Calgary Conjoint Health Research Ethics Board. Findings from this study will inform the development of clinical decision support tool that integrates patient preferences with clinical risk information to support patient-care provider discussion about optimal treatment for multivessel CAD management."

The Leading and Managing for Results in Pandemics (LMRP) program was developed to strengthen the capacity of public health leaders responding to COVID-19. To assess the influence of the program on applying leadership and management practices and on pandemic readiness, a mixed methods outcome harvesting evaluation approach was adapted. Quantitative programmatic data and supplemental qualitative program participant interview data were analyzed to inform draft outcomes. Program participants validated outcomes, which were then updated, triangulated, and used to inform recommendations. The results illustrated increases in applying leadership and management practices, and improvements in team dynamics and morale. Themes from the qualitative interviews included strengthened teamwork, leadership skills, and ability to manage disease outbreaks and future pandemics. The validated outcomes described improvements in leadership and management skills, pandemic readiness, and interpersonal skills following LMRP participation. The evaluation found evidence that LMRP program participants gained knowledge, skills, and tools, which they applied to perform more effectively as a team and to lead preparation for and management of public health emergencies and disease outbreaks. The program brought about positive changes in the systems and processes through which participants approach their work and apply the leading and managing practices to collaboratively work towards a common goal.

Patients often experience delays in diagnosis, lack of adequate information, and limited support for disease management. Social media has emerged as a valuable tool to address these gaps by facilitating information exchange, peer support, and community building. However, its role in myositis care is not yet well understood. This study aims to explore how myositis patients use social media, focusing on shared content, perceived benefits and challenges, and the overall impact on disease management and emotional well-being. A mixed-methods approach was applied, including semi-structured interviews with 11 patients and a netnographic analysis of social media group dedicated to myositis care. Data were analyzed using Kuckartz's structured qualitative content analysis, with coding performed inductively, to identify key themes. Four key themes emerged: (I) Social media as a global platform for sharing experiential knowledge, particularly on symptom management, medication side effects, and coping strategies. (II) Peer support fostering a sense of belonging, emotional exchange, and mutual encouragement through structured discussions and community-driven moderation. (III) Perceived benefits, such as real-time access to patient-driven insights, shared decision-making support, and enhanced communication with healthcare providers. (IV) Perceived drawbacks, including misinformation, privacy concerns, and the absence of professional medical input. Participants emphasized the need for expert involvement to improve content reliability, while also valuing the autonomy and emotional support within these communities. Social media platforms, particularly closed groups, provide a complementary avenue to traditional care by offering support and knowledge exchange. To maximize their potential, privacy concerns and the integration of professional guidance must be addressed."

    "title": "Safety, Tolerability, and Immunogenicity of mRNA-1345 in Adults at Increased Risk for RSV Disease Aged 18 to 59 Years.",
    "abstract": "Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a significant health risk for adults aged 18-59 years with chronic medical conditions. This ongoing, randomized, double-blind Phase 3 trial evaluates safety and immunogenicity of the RSV vaccine, mRNA-1345, in adults aged 18-59 years at increased risk for RSV-associated lower respiratory tract disease (LRTD). Participants received a single 50-Âµg (licensed dose) or 30-Âµg dose. Co-primary immunogenicity objectives were to demonstrate noninferiority of Day 29 RSV-A and RSV-B neutralizing antibody (nAb) geometric mean titers (GMTs) for the 50-Î¼g dose compared to those observed in adults aged â¥60 years from the Phase 3 pivotal efficacy trial. The other primary objective was to evaluate safety and tolerability. 999 participants received mRNA-1345 (50-Âµg, n=502; 30-Âµg, n=497). Most solicited adverse reactions (ARs) were mild to moderate with a median duration of 2 days. Injection-site pain, fatigue, headache, and myalgia were the most common ARs. Day 29 nAb GMTs in the 50-Âµg group met noninferiority criteria: RSV-A GMT ratio (GMR) was 1.2 (95% CI: 1.1-1.3); RSV-B GMR was 1.1 (95% CI: 1.0-1.2). Noninferiority was also demonstrated for seroresponse rate differences: RSV-A at 11.8% (95% CI: 7.8-15.5); RSV-B at 10.8% (95% CI: 5.9-15.6). Immune responses were consistent across subgroups and remained above baseline through Day 181. In adults aged 18-59 years at increased risk for RSV-LRTD, a 50-Âµg dose of mRNA-1345 was well-tolerated and elicited RSV-A and RSV-B nAb responses noninferior to those observed in older adults in the pivotal study, supporting inference of efficacy in this population.

    "abstract": "Some patients who test trace-positive on Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra (\"Ultra\"), a highly sensitive molecular diagnostic platform, may not have tuberculosis (TB) disease. A better understanding of the prevalence of TB disease, associated clinical characteristics, and utility of additional diagnostic tests among people with trace sputum (PWTS) could aid clinical decision-making. We enrolled adults and adolescents with trace-positive sputum on initial TB diagnostic evaluation in Uganda and South Africa. Participants were extensively evaluated at enrollment; those with uncertain TB status were followed off treatment, with interval reevaluations by TB clinicians, for up to three months. We assessed TB prevalence and associated patient characteristics and diagnostic results. Among 311 PWTS, TB was identified by sputum culture at enrollment in 20% of participants (61/311, 95% CI 15-24%). Within three months, 48% (145/301, 95% CI 43-54%) had been judged by clinicians to warrant TB treatment, and among those followed until microbiologic outcomes, 30% (68/227, 95% CI 24-36%) had positive culture and 41% (99/240, 95% CI 35-47%) had positive culture or Ultra. Having TB symptoms, advanced HIV, and no recent TB history were associated with microbiologically-confirmed TB disease, as were an abnormal chest x-ray (in those without recent TB) or elevated CRP. Roughly half of PWTS were started on TB therapy. Given the low observed mortality rate, some low-risk people with negative results on widely available diagnostic tests could safely defer treatment. Multimodal testing, repeated evaluations, and longer follow-up duration are needed to fully assess the TB burden in PWTS."

    "title": "High-Sensitivity Top-Down Proteomics Reveals Enhanced Maturation of Micropatterned Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Cardiomyocytes.",
    "abstract": "Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) are increasingly used for disease modeling, drug discovery, and precision medicine, yet their utility is often limited by their immature phenotype. One promising maturation strategy involves using micropatterned substrates that mimic native cardiomyocytes' organizational growth and stiffness. However, the molecular maturity of this model has not yet been assessed, and there is currently no method to extract proteins from micropatterned hiPSC-CMs for top-down proteomic analysis. Herein, we present a high-sensitivity, surfactant-free protein extraction protocol for the top-down proteomic analysis of hiPSC-CMs. Through this method, we assessed the maturation of micropatterned hiPSC-CMs compared to traditional unstructured monoculture and co-culture monolayers at the proteoform level. We found that micropatterned hiPSC-CMs display molecular signatures of cardiomyocyte maturations including increased expression of ventricular myosin light chain isoforms, reduced expression of the fetal troponin T isoform, and decreased phosphorylation of alpha-tropomyosin. This surfactant-free, high-sensitivity approach enables robust top-down proteomics from limited, heterogeneous cell populations, and identifies the micropattern hiPSC-CM as a more adult-like CM model, broadening the utility of structured culture systems for cardiac disease modeling and translational research."

    "abstract": "Amyloid burden impacts cognitive decline in the pre-dementia stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but there remains significant variability in cognitive trajectories that may be explainable by markers of synaptic function and neurodegeneration. Leveraging longitudinal data from two harmonized, at-risk but predominantly unimpaired cohorts, we examined how several proteins measured from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) differ by amyloid status, cognitive status, and impact cognitive decline measured using a Preclinical Alzheimer's Cognitive Composite. Four hundred and thirty-four individuals provided CSF biomarkers of amyloid-beta42 (ab42), phosphorylated tau (181), from which we identified AÎ² + individuals using a cutoff based on a p-tau181/AÎ²42 ratio. Other markers of neurodegeneration (N) included neurofilament light, neurogranin, SNAP-25, and NPTX2. Most biomarkers of N were higher in the AÎ² + group and lower in cognitively unimpaired individuals, though NPTX2 exhibited the opposite pattern. Even in the face of AÎ²+, NPTX2 was higher in individuals who showed slower rates of cognitive decline, suggesting NPTX2 may be associated with cognitive resilience. Moreover, a SNAP-25/NPTX2 ratio of synaptic dysfunction explained more variance in cognitive decline than other biomarkers alone. This work provides support for potentially useful biomarkers of synaptic function implicated in the clinical syndrome of AD, aiding in future diagnosis and staging efforts."

    "abstract": "Compliance is the most challenging aspect of long-term therapy in Wilson's disease (WD). Evidence is presented that butyrylcholinesterase (CHE) can be used as a sensitive biomarker to detect compliance problems in long-term treated WD-patients. For the present retrospective, monocentric study demographical and treatment related data of 108 WD-patients (who had been treated at the Clinic of Neurology of the university hospital in DÃ¼sseldorf (Germany) between 2/2005 and 1/2021) were extracted from the charts. These patients underwent 2003 therapy control visits. The present study focuses on the analysis of three parameters of copper metabolism (serum levels of ceruloplasmin (CER-S), copper (CU-S) and the 24 h-urinary copper excretion (24 h-UCU)) and the serum levels of CHE (CHE-S). A patient was classified to be non-compliant when in his charts at least 8 24 h-UCU-values were found, and all his 24 h-UCU-values were larger than 60 Î¼g/d (N-COM8-group). A patient was classified to be compliant when at least one of at least 8 24 h-UCU-values was lower than or equal to 60 Î¼g/d (COM8-group). CHE-S was significantly (<i>p</i> < 0.05) different between thus defined compliant or non-compliant patients. Neither CU-S nor CER-S nor calculated free (non-ceruloplasmin-bound) serum copper levels (NCC-S) were significantly different between the NCOM8- and COM8-group. Analysis of the area under the curve and sensitivity and specificity by means of ROC-curves underlined the sensitivity of CHE-S in contrast to the insensitivity of CU-S and CER-S to detect patients who had been classified as compliant/non-compliant on the basis of their 24 h-UCU-values. When compliance of WD-patients is classified on the basis of their 24 h-urinary copper excretion CHE-S is more sensitive to detect problems of non-compliance than serum levels of copper, of non-ceruloplasmin bound free copper or ceruloplasmin. Therefore, CHE-S may be used as an easy to determine further biomarker for compliance assessment in long-term treatment of WD in addition to 24 h-UCU."

    "title": "Using vascular biomarkers to assess heart failure event risk in hospitalized patients with and without AKI.",
    "abstract": "Patients with AKI experience higher rates of heart failure (HF). This study seeks to identify criteria to assess the risk of heart failure post-hospitalization, with a special focus on AKI patients. We hypothesized that the combined use of 9 vascular biomarkers would predict future heart failure events after AKI. Using a study of 1497 hospitalized patients with and without AKI, we found that these 9 vascular biomarkers successfully stratified patients into different risk groups for HF, and were able to improve prediction of HF when added to routine clinical variables. Using the ASSESS-AKI cohort, we performed an unsupervised spectral cluster analysis with 9 plasma biomarkers measured at 3 months post-hospitalization [Angiopoietin (angpt)-1, angpt-2, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A, VEGF-C, VEGF-d, VEGF receptor 1 (R1), solubleTie-2 (sTie-2), placental growth factor (PlGF), and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF)] in 1,497 patients, half of whom had AKI. We used a Cox regression analysis to evaluate the associations between the clusters and HF. Models were adjusted for demographics, cardiovascular disease risk factors, medications, ICU status, lung disease, sepsis, clinical center, and 3-month post-discharge serum creatinine and proteinuria. We calculated change in the area under the curve (AUC) for the prediction of HF or death at 3 years by adding the biomarkers to a clinical model selected by a penalized regression with LASSO. We also calculated a net reclassification index for the addition of the biomarkers to the clinical model. Three biomarker-derived clusters were identified: Cluster 1 [n = 302, Vascular Injury (Injury) Phenotype] had higher levels of injury markers, whereas Cluster 2 [n = 728, Vascular Repair (Repair) Phenotype] had higher levels of repair markers. Cluster 3 (n = 467) had lower levels of all markers (Dormant Phenotype). Across the entire cohort, those with the Injury Phenotype had twofold higher risk of a HF event compared to the Repair Phenotype [aHR 2.24 (95% CI: 1.57-3.19)] and noted in both participants with AKI [aHR 2.12 (95% CI: 1.35-3.34)] and without AKI [aHR 2.94 (95%CI: 1.57-5.50)]. The Dormant Phenotype was associated with higher risk of HF events only in participants without AKI. The AUC for the prediction of HF event or death at 3 years by the biomarkers was 0.76 (95% CI: 0.73-0.80), 0.77 (95% CI: 0.73-0.80) for the clinical model, and 0.80 (95% CI: 0.77-0.83) for the combined model. The addition of the biomarkers significantly improved reclassification of HF event or death. Vascular biomarkers can be used to derive phenotypes capable of stratifying future risk of HF events in recently hospitalized patients with or without AKI."

Systematic review and meta-analysis for diagnostic accuracy. First-trimester ultrasound detects 93.3% (95% confidence interval 90.4% to 95.7%) of a pre-selected group of eight major anomalies with specificity of 99.99% (95% confidence interval 99.98% to 99.99%) and positive predictive value of 96.5% (95% confidence interval 93.3 to 98.8, 416,877 fetuses, 40 studies). For major cardiac anomalies, the respective data are 55.8% (95% confidence interval 45.9% to 65.5%), 99.98% (95% confidence interval 99.97% to 99.99%) and 94.85% (95% confidence interval 91.63% to 97.32%, 306,872 fetuses, 45 studies). Of NHS trusts surveyed, 77% currently perform first-trimester anatomy assessment, with evidence of inequity of care; earlier screening resulted in more diagnoses before 16 weeks' gestation. A consensus procedure (<i>n</i> = 172) developed an anatomical protocol and minimum targets for diagnosis. Parental survey (<i>n</i> = 1374) indicated that over 90% would opt for such screening. Modelling of singleton pregnancies undergoing earlier anomaly screening using two-dimensional ultrasound was associated with increased mean healthcare costs per woman (Â£11, 95% confidence interval Â£1 to Â£29) and maternal quality-adjusted life-years (0.002065, 95% confidence interval 0.000565 to 0.00358), an incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year of Â£5270, with likelihood of being cost-effective at Â£20,000 per quality-adjusted life-year of over 95%. Additional modelling predicted reductions in infant healthcare costs and quality-adjusted life-years. Decision uncertainty was low. Value-of-information analysis of cost-effectiveness results showed no groups of parameters for which further research to reduce uncertainty would likely prove cost-effective. Study heterogeneity; the lack of a universal reference standard; simplifying assumptions relating to economic model structure; and estimation of some parameters are documented and justified. The rarity of the conditions made estimation of longer-term maternal and infant costs and quality-adjusted life-years challenging, resulting in likely under-estimation of healthcare costs. With standardisation and training, first-trimester ultrasound screening for fetal anomalies is clinically effective with over 90% detection for eight major conditions and low false-positive rates. Decision uncertainty around implementation is low and a prospective study would not be an efficient investment. Adding first-trimester anomaly screening to the current screening likely represents a cost-effective use of resources and is acceptable to parents. Focus on developing an implementation framework to modify the current United Kingdom Fetal Anomaly Screening Programme. This study is registered as PROSPERO CRD42018111781 and CRD42018112434.

    "abstract": "Interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features (IPAF) describes patients with interstitial lung disease (ILD) and autoimmune features without meeting criteria for a specific rheumatic disease. No longitudinal data exist on post-transplant outcomes in IPAF patients. We compared baseline demographics, pre-transplant characteristics, and post-transplant outcomes between IPAF and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) patients undergoing double lung transplantation. We retrospectively analyzed lung transplant recipients with ILD in British Columbia between Jan 1, 2014, and Apr 30, 2024. Diagnoses of IPAF and IPF were made by multidisciplinary review. Continuous variables were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test, categorical variables with Fisher's Exact test, and survival using Kaplan-Meier analysis. We identified 20 IPAF and 64 IPF patients. IPAF patients were more likely female (50% vs 17%, p = 0.006), on pre-transplant immunosuppression (60% vs 6.3%, p < 0.001), and were less likely to receive antifibrotics (20% vs 64%, p < 0.001). No difference was seen in 1-year or cumulative survival, though survival curves diverged over time favouring IPAF. Post-transplant lung function, acute rejection, infection-related hospitalization, malignancy, and chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) were similar, with non-usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) IPAF exhibiting a survival advantage over IPF (100% vs 66%, p = 0.044). Explant pathology revealed more UIP patterns in IPF, while IPAF showed nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) or unclassifiable patterns. Post-transplant survival, lung function, and complication rates were comparable between IPAF and IPF patients at one year and the last follow-up. This is the first study to report both short- and long-term lung transplant outcomes in IPAF patients."

    "abstract": "Liver transplant is indicated in patients with Wilson's disease for acute hepatic failure, advanced cirrhosis, and disease refractory to chelation therapy. This study aims to systematically review data about overall morbidity, hepatic, neuropsychiatric, and survival outcomes following liver transplantation for Wilson disease. MEDLINE, Embase, and Central were searched from inception until July 2023. Peer-reviewed articles and published abstracts evaluating patients diagnosed with Wilson's disease and undergoing any type of liver transplant as a result of the disease were eligible for inclusion. A restricted maximum likelihood random effects model was used to generate the pooled proportion of each outcome. The risk of bias for each included observational study was assessed using the Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies tool. A total of 39 studies met all inclusion criteria. All studies were observational. Specific indications for liver transplant were most commonly acute liver failure (36.73%), chronic liver failure (45.02%), and acute-on-chronic liver failure (8.35%). The pooled proportions of mortality at 30 days, 1, and 5 years were 0.10 (95% CI 0.08, 0.13; I<sup>2</sup> = 16%), 0.11 (95% CI 0.09, 0.14; I<sup>2</sup> = 37%), and 0.15 (95% CI 0.11, 0.20; I<sup>2</sup> = 81%), respectively. The postoperative complication with the greatest prevalence was biopsy-proven acute rejection with a pooled proportion of 0.20 (95% CI 0.12, 0.31; I<sup>2</sup> = 84%). The mean MINORS score for risk of bias for all studies was 8.19. Overall, reporting quality and consistency of outcomes included in the studies was poor as assessed using the MINORS score. Pooled proportions for 30-day, 1- and 5-year mortality are similar, suggesting most postoperative deaths are acute in nature. Future research should incorporate objective measures and the reporting of standardized parameters to allow more robust comparisons between studies."

Whether lipidomic changes are part of the BM TME alterations associated with this disease progression remains poorly understood. To investigate and compare the levels of individual lipid species across different lipid classes in the BM-TME, specifically BM plasma, of MGUS and MM patients. A mass spectrometry-based targeted lipidomics approach was employed to quantify individual lipid species from various lipid classes in BM plasma samples obtained from 22 MGUS and 24 MM patients. Significant differences in lipid species were observed between the BM-TME of MGUS and MM patients. MM patients exhibited elevated levels of triacylglycerol (TAG) species containing long-chain fatty acids (FAs) with higher degrees of unsaturation. In contrast, MGUS patients had higher levels of TAG species with shorter-chain FAs and lower unsaturation. Additionally, MM patients with a higher percentage of clonal plasma cells and increased proliferation rates displayed lipid profiles more closely resembling MM-associated signatures than MGUS. The differential abundance of individual lipid species within the BM-TME highlights metabolic changes associated with the progression from MGUS to MM. These findings provide valuable insights into the lipidomic underpinnings of MM pathogenesis, offering a foundation for future research into metabolic biomarkers and therapeutic targets."

    "abstract": "Black men in the US are 1.8 and 2.2 times more likely to develop and die from prostate cancer (PCa) than non-Hispanic White men, respectively, and have the highest incidence globally. Furthermore, Black men undergoing androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for PCa face a higher risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) compared to men of other racial groups. Therefore, we have designed a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to investigate the impact of exercise on CVD risk factors among Black man undergoing ADT. The POWER trial is a dual-arm RCT designed to examine the effects of a 16-week, culturally tailored, remotely supervised cardiovascular and strength exercise program on Black men with PCa receiving ADT. Sixty-two patients will be randomized in a 1:1 allocation to either the exercise intervention or a waitlist control group. The patient population includes adult males who self-identify as Black, receiving ADT for at least four months prospectively at the time of recruitment. The primary outcome is the CVD risk assessed using the Framingham Risk Score. The secondary and exploratory outcomes include physical fitness and function, patient-reported outcomes, and clinical events at a one-year follow-up. The POWER Trial evaluates a culturally tailored exercise program for Black men with PCa undergoing ADT, focusing on improving cardiovascular health. The findings of the study are expected to inform a larger phase clinical trial to examine long-term CVD-related clinical outcomes. Ultimately, our findings and subsequent trials would narrow the gap in health disparities among the communities of Black men with PCa. NCT05327465."

The Mini-COMET clinical trial, a phase 2, open-label, ascending-dose, 3-cohort study, has a 25-week primary analysis period (PAP) and an extension treatment period (ETP). In the PAP, cohorts 1 (n=6) and 2 (n=5) received avalglucosidase alfa 20 or 40 mg/kg every other week (qow), respectively. Cohort 3 received avalglucosidase alfa 40 mg/kg qow (n=5) or alglucosidase alfa (pre-study [>6 months] stable dose: 20 mg/kg qow to 40 mg/kg weekly; n=6). All children completed the PAP and entered the ETP. Children receiving avalglucosidase alfa in the PAP continued the same dose in the ETP. Those receiving alglucosidase alfa in the PAP received avalglucosidase alfa 40 mg/kg qow in the ETP. At baseline, children were 1-12 years old. Interim data (â¥97 weeks) are presented from all 22 children, 20 receiving avalglucosidase alfa 40 mg/kg qow and 2 receiving 20 mg/kg qow in the ETP. Among the 6 who received 20 mg/kg qow avalglucosidase alfa in PAP (cohort 1), 4 had their dose increase to 40 mg/kg qow because of further clinical decline in the ETP. No child died or discontinued at data cut-off. PAP and ETP safety profiles were similar; no treatment-related serious or severe treatment-emergent adverse events occurred. Avalglucosidase alfa was well-tolerated, with no increased safety risk or immunogenicity concerns post-treatment switch. Echocardiography revealed persistent left-ventricular mass Z-score normalization. Compared with baseline, biomarkers of Pompe disease burden decreased, and motor function improved or stabilized. Results support the positive clinical impact of long-term avalglucosidase alfa in children with IOPD."

    "abstract": "The <i>KRAS (Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog)</i> gene is recognized as the most frequently mutated oncogene in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The most prevalent mutation within this gene is G12C, formally known as <i>KRAS G12C</i>, which leads to the substitution of glycine with cysteine at position 12 of the KRAS protein. Recent advancements in research have developed effective therapies designed to inhibit activated KRAS signaling. As a result, the first two accelerated FDA-approved KRAS inhibitors, sotorasib, and adagrasib have been successfully introduced to the market for locally advanced or metastatic <i>KRAS G12C</i> mutated NSCLC who progressed after prior therapy. A second generation of KRAS inhibitors is currently being tested in clinical trials, and in combination with immunotherapy and chemotherapy. Future research is crucial to determine the optimal timing for treatment with KRAS G12C inhibitors. Additional studies are needed to identify biomarkers that predict which patients will benefit most. This review discusses and analyzes both completed and ongoing clinical trials of first and second-generation KRAS inhibitors. It also addresses mechanisms of resistance to KRAS inhibition, potential therapeutic strategies to overcome this resistance, biomarkers, side effects, and its role in central nervous system metastatic disease."

The highest recessive disorders rate among pregnant women was found for the G6PD gene mutation (G6PD deficiency) at a rate of about 1 in 20 individuals, followed by the HBA1 and HBA2 gene mutations (Alpha Thalassemia) at a rate of about 1 in 25. Other common recessive carrier genes included SRD5A2 (5-alpha reductase deficiency) at a rate of about 1 in 27, HBB (Beta Thalassemia) at a rate of about 1 in 28, ATP7B (Wilson's disease) at a rate of about 1 in 40, PAH (Phenylketonuria) at a rate of about 1 in 40, and SLC25A13 (Citrin deficiency) at a rate of about 1 in 45. The prevalence of recessive carriers among Vietnamese pregnant women is high, and at least 1 in 5 pregnant women carries one recessive gene. It is essential to encourage Vietnamese pregnant women to conduct recessive carrier screening tests to reduce mortality rates among children and to implement effective pregnancy planning and childbirth."

    "title": "Immune responses and recovery from spotty liver disease in layer birds.",
    "abstract": "Spotty Liver Disease (SLD), caused by Campylobacter hepaticus, greatly impacts the health and egg production of affected layer hens and is a disease of concern in the poultry industry. This study aimed to enhance the understanding of the immune response in chickens to C. hepaticus infection and their ability to resist reinfections. One hundred- and twenty-layer chickens were allocated to 10 groups and challenged, from one to three times, with C. hepaticus HV10<sup>T</sup>, with six weeks between each challenge. Blood and cloacal swabs were collected every three weeks to assess antibody responses and Campylobacter presence. Upon necropsy, bile, spleen, jejunum, and blood samples were collected for C. hepaticus detection and host gene expression analysis using qPCR and RNA sequencing. We found that most birds challenged with C. hepaticus for the second or third time did not develop liver lesions even with the presence of C. hepaticus in their bile, suggesting that birds were resistant to disease development following repeated exposure. Anti-C. hepaticus antibodies increased significantly six weeks after a single challenge but reduced from nine weeks. Quantitative PCR demonstrated that C. hepaticus could be recovered from the bile six weeks after a single challenge and increased significantly after a secondary challenge. RNA-seq and qPCR data demonstrate an elevation in pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin 6 (IL-6) and interleukin 1Ã (IL-1Ã), after a secondary challenge and down-regulation during a third challenge. Expression of many genes encoding barrier-supporting proteins genes were differentially expressed, with increased expression following a third challenge compared to expression after a single challenge. Comparison of gene expression in tissues of triple to a single challenged birds demonstrated that many genes involved in cytokine activity and the JAK-STAT cascade were down-regulated whereas other immune system pathways were up-regulated. Altogether, the results indicate that over time, immune memory, enhanced barrier function, and a balanced immune response developed, resulting in reduced impact of infection on the birds. These findings show that the impact of C. hepaticus infection can be ameliorated by immune responses and hence indicate that vaccines that induce appropriate protective immune responses should provide an effective tool to reduce SLD in poultry."

    "abstract": "Zasocitinib (TAK-279) is an investigational, oral, highly selective, and potent allosteric TYK2 inhibitor. This study assessed the TYK2 inhibitory selectivity and potency of zasocitinib versus those of licensed TYK2 and Jak inhibitors. Binding affinities were determined using homogenous time-resolved fluorescence. In vitro concentration-percentage inhibition curves for IL-23-phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription (pSTAT)3, type I IFN-pSTAT3, IL-12-pSTAT4, IL-2-pSTAT5, and thrombopoietin-pSTAT3 pathways were established using human whole-blood assays. Relationships between concentration and percentage inhibition were determined to estimate half-maximal inhibitory concentration. Times above half-maximal inhibitory concentration and percentage daily inhibition were modeled from simulated clinical concentrations. Zasocitinib bound the TYK2 Janus homology 2 domain with an inhibitory constant of 0.0087 nM, demonstrating more than 1 millionfold selectivity over Jak1. Zasocitinib potently inhibited TYK2 signaling, with half-maximal inhibitory concentrations of 48.2 nM (95% confidence interval = 36.8-63.1 nM), 21.6 nM (95% confidence interval = 17.3-26.9 nM), and 57.0 nM (95% confidence interval = 44.2-73.4 nM) for IL-23-pSTAT3, type I IFN-pSTAT3, and IL-12-pSTAT4 pathways, respectively; zasocitinib showed no inhibition of Jak1/2/3. Simulated clinical concentrations of 30 mg zasocitinib once daily exceeded the TYK2 half-maximal inhibitory concentration for 24 hours, maintaining >90% daily inhibition, with no Jak1/2/3 inhibition. The distinct potent and selective inhibition profile of zasocitinib defines it as a next-generation TYK2 inhibitor."

    "abstract": "Hepatolenticular Degeneration (HLD) is a rare condition caused by a genetic copper metabolism disorder and a basal ganglia-dominated degenerative brain disease. Its characteristic clinical features include progressive extrapyramidal symptoms, psychiatric manifestations, cirrhosis, renal impairment, and the Kayser-Fleischer ring. Furthermore, its key diagnostic bases include the ceruloplasmin level, copper oxidase activity, trace copper in the human body, brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), and genetic testing. Here, we present an HLD case with atypical clinical manifestations. A 43-year-old male HLD patient presented to our hospital with normal copper oxidase activity and serum copper levels, as well as results of ceruloplasmin testing, slit-lamp examination, and histopathological examination of the liver, which showed no typical manifestations. On the other hand, the genetic testing results showed new mutation sites. To improve our clinical understanding of HLD and reduce the probability of misdiagnosis and missed diagnosis, we discussed and clarified the clinical manifestations, pathogenesis, and diagnosis and treatment of the disease, all based on existing literature."

    "abstract": "The purpose of this specialty-specific clinical practice guideline is to identify quality improvement opportunities and provide clinicians with trustworthy, evidence-based recommendations for the surgical management of chronic rhinosinusitis in adults. The target audience includes otolaryngologist-head and neck surgeons who manage adults with chronic rhinosinusitis, including candidacy and performance of endoscopic sinus surgery. This executive summary describes the guideline developed using the 55-page protocol published as the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation's Clinical Practice Guideline Development Manual (3rd edition), which summarizes the methodology for assessments of current data, topic prioritization, development of key action statements (KASs), application of value judgments, and related procedures. The guideline group represented otolaryngologists, rhinologists, advanced practice nursing and physician assistants, and consumers who represented participating national professional organizations. The Guideline Development Group made strong recommendations for the following KASs: Before considering surgery, the surgeon should verify an existing diagnosis of chronic rhinosinusitis to ensure established diagnostic criteria (signs and symptoms) from clinical practice guidelines are met, and the surgeon should assess candidacy for sinus surgery based on symptoms, disease characteristics, quality of life, and prior medical or surgical therapy (KASs 1A and 1B). The surgeon or their designee should not prescribe antibacterial therapy to an adult with chronic rhinosinusitis if significant or persistent purulent nasal discharge (anterior, posterior, or both) is absent on examination (KAS 3). The Guideline Development Group made recommendations for the following KASs: The surgeon should not endorse or require a predefined, one-size-fits-all regimen or duration of medical therapy (eg, antibiotics, steroids, antihistamines) as a prerequisite to sinus surgery for an adult with chronic rhinosinusitis (KAS 2). The surgeon should identify patients with chronic rhinosinusitis that would benefit most from surgery and are least likely to benefit from continued medical therapy alone, such as those with chronic rhinosinusitis subtypes that include, but are not limited to, chronic rhinosinusitis with polyps, polyps with bony erosion, eosinophilic mucin, or fungal balls (KAS 4). The surgeon or their designee should counsel patients before sinus surgery to establish realistic expectations, including the potential for chronicity or relapse, and the likelihood of long-term medical management, taking into account their chronic rhinosinusitis subtype (KAS 5). The surgeon should offer sinus surgery to an adult with chronic rhinosinusitis when the anticipated benefits exceed that of nonsurgical management alone, there is clarity regarding the anticipated outcomes, and the patient understands the expectation for long-term disease management following surgery (KAS 6). For an adult who is a candidate for sinus surgery, the surgeon or their designee should obtain a computed tomography (CT) scan with a fine-cut protocol, if not already available, to examine the paranasal sinuses for surgical planning (KAS 7). The surgeon should not plan the extent of sinus surgery (eg, which specific sinuses to operate on) solely based on arbitrary criteria regarding a minimal level of mucosal thickening, sinus opacification, or outflow obstruction on a CT scan (KAS 8). The surgeon or their designee should educate an adult with chronic rhinosinusitis who is scheduled for sinus surgery regarding anticipated postoperative care, specifically pain control, debridement, medical management, activity restrictions, return to work, duration and frequency of follow-up visits, and the potential for recurrent disease or revision surgery (KAS 9). When the sinus involves polyps, osteitis, bony erosion, or fungal disease in an adult with chronic rhinosinusitis who is scheduled for sinus surgery, the surgeon should perform sinus surgery that includes full exposure of the sinus cavity (lumen) and removal of diseased tissue, not just balloon or manual ostial dilation, or refer the patient to a surgeon who can perform this extent of surgery (KAS 10). The surgeon or their designee should routinely follow up to assess and document outcomes of sinus surgery for chronic rhinosinusitis, between 3 and 12 months after the procedure, through history (symptom relief, quality of life, complications, adherence to therapy, need for rescue medications, and ongoing care) and nasal endoscopy (KAS 11). There were no recommendations that were considered options from the Guideline Development Group."

    "title": "High-Fidelity CRISPR-Cas12a-Based APOL1 Genotyping.",
    "abstract": "Approximately 13% of African Americans have a combination of risk variants of the APOL1 gene, often termed the APOL1 \"high-risk genotype\", which predisposes individuals to serious kidney diseases such as focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. Despite the potential severity of APOL1-linked kidney disease, genetic testing for APOL1 variants is uncommonly performed. Point-of-care testing has the potential to be transformative in patient care to immediately identify risk status, particularly for the evaluation of deceased donor organs in the setting of transplantation, but no assays are available to date. To begin to address this unmet need, we developed a CRISPR-Cas12a-mediated genotyping assay for the detection of pathological APOL1 variants from patient samples for potential use in a point-of-care setting. For each variant, crRNA guides were identified that could readily discriminate between either the 'wild-type' or variant sequence in a Cas12a- trans -cleavage assay using both fluorescence- and lateral flow-based detection methods. Interestingly, no protospacer-adjacent-motif (PAM) sequence was required for the CRISPR-Cas12a-based detection of any of the variants. CRISPR-Cas12a fluorescence-based genotyping assays performed on patient samples achieved 100% sensitivity and specificity compared to genotypes obtained using a clinically-validated TaqMan assay. Similar results were also obtained in lateral flow assay format with a FAM- and biotin-labeled reporter. The successful deployment in this study of Cas12a-based assays to generate APOL1 genotypes for individuals with high fidelity provides promise for a genotyping method potentially amenable to point-of-care use."

    "abstract": "The test-negative design (TND) has been widely used to assess postmarketing COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness but requires further evaluation for this application. To determine whether the TND reliably evaluates vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic COVID-19 using placebo-controlled vaccine efficacy randomized clinical trials (RCTs). This secondary cross-protocol analysis constructed TND study datasets from study sites in 16 countries across 5 continents using the blinded phase cohorts of 5 harmonized phase 3 COVID-19 Prevention Network RCTs: COVE (Coronavirus Vaccine Efficacy and Safety), AZD1222, ENSEMBLE, PREVENT-19 (Prefusion Protein Subunit Vaccine Efficacy Novavax Trial COVID-19), and VAT00008. Participants included adults who received the intended number of doses, experienced COVID-19-like symptoms, and obtained SARS-CoV-2 testing. Start dates ranged from July 27, 2020, to October 19, 2021; data cutoff dates ranged from March 26, 2021, to March 15, 2022. Statistical analysis was performed from May 11, 2023, to February 25, 2025. Participants received vaccines consisting of messenger RNA-1273 (COVE; 2 doses 28 days apart), ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222; 2 doses 28 days apart), Ad26.COV2.S (ENSEMBLE; 1 dose), NVX-CoV2373 (PREVENT-19; 2 doses 21 days apart), CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (VAT00008; D614) (2 doses 21 days apart), or CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (D614 plus B.1.351) (VAT00008; 2 doses 21 days apart) or placebo. Main outcomes were symptomatic COVID-19 according to each trial's primary efficacy definition and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention definition. Vaccine effectiveness was estimated using targeted maximum likelihood estimation under a semiparametric logistic regression model and ordinary logistic regression. Noncase exchangeability, a core TND assumption for unbiased estimation, was also assessed by estimating vaccine efficacy against non-COVID-19 illness. Among the 12 157 participants included in the analysis, mean (SD) age was 45 (15) years, 6414 were female (53%), 5858 were vaccinated (48%), 2835 experienced primary COVID-19 (23%), and 2992 experienced Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-defined COVID-19 (25%). TND vaccine effectiveness estimates were concordant with RCT vaccine efficacy estimates (concordance correlation coefficient, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.58-0.96] for both outcomes). The semiparametric method had 48% smaller variance estimates than ordinary logistic regression. Noncase exchangeability was generally supported with a median vaccine efficacy against non-COVID-19 illness of 7.7% (IQR, 2.7%-16.8%) across trial cohorts and most 95% CIs including 0. In this cross-protocol analysis, the TND provided reliable inferences on COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness in health care-seeking populations for multiple vaccines and symptom definitions when confounding and selection bias were absent. A machine-learning approach for robust confounding control in postmarketing TND studies was also introduced."

    "abstract": "Despite growing clinical use of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS), inconsistency remains in the modality's role in clinical pathways for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) diagnosis and management. This AJR Expert Panel Narrative Review provides practical insights on the use of CEUS for the diagnosis of HCC across populations, including individuals at high risk for HCC, individuals with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, and remaining individuals not at high risk for HCC. Considerations addressed with respect to high-risk patients include CEUS diagnostic criteria for HCC, use of CEUS for differentiating HCC from non-HCC malignancy, use of CEUS for small (â¤2 cm) lesions, use of CEUS for characterizing occult lesions on B-mode ultrasound, and use of CEUS for indeterminate lesions on CT or MRI. Representative literature addressing the use of CEUS for HCC diagnosis as well as gaps in knowledge requiring further investigation are highlighted. Throughout these discussions, the article distinguishes two broad types of ultrasound contrast agents used for liver imaging: pure blood-pool agents and a combined blood-pool and Kupffer-cell agent. Additional topics include the use of CEUS for treatment response assessment after nonradiation therapies and implications of artificial intelligence technologies. The article concludes with a series of consensus statements from the author panel."

The Alberta Provincial Project for Outcomes Assessment (APPROACH) developed an ePROM clinical report that includes 4 validated PROM instruments (Seattle Angina Questionnaire, 7-item version [SAQ-7], Patient Health Questionnaire, 2-item and 9-item [PHQ-2 & PHQ-9], Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Survey [MOS SSS], EuroQol Group 5-level assessment [EQ-5D-5L] and the Self-Care of Coronary Heart Disease Inventory). The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of the APPROACH ePROM clinician report as an adjunct to the care of patients with established coronary artery disease. Utilizing a pre-post interventional study design, we evaluate the APPROACH ePROM tool in 4 outpatient cardiology practices in Alberta over 8 months. A total of 80 patients in the preintervention period and 120 patients in the intervention period will be recruited to participate, and each patient will contribute a single visit. Study outcomes will be evaluated using ePROM usage metrics, and a post-visit survey for both physicians and patients, a single exit interview for physicians, and focus groups for patients. Outcomes will be the feasibility and acceptability of the ePROMs report, as well as its efficacy, based on comparison of measures of physician-patient communication between groups. The pilot will allow us to better understand the possible limitations and facilitators of the study, to guide their further evaluation (full-scale trial) and dissemination.

The protein with a molecular weight of approximately 85 kDa reacted with antibodies against human and mouse, but not rat, ceruloplasmin and exhibited oxidase activity. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that the F21D5.3 protein possesses four copper-binding sites, similar to those in other multicopper oxidases (MCOs), and plastocyanin-like domains characteristic of MCOs. However, neither an iron-binding domain nor ferroxidase activity, typical features of MCOs, were detected through in silico analysis and or in-gel assays. Despite the absence of ferroxidase activity, these findings suggest that the protein may be the product of the <i>F21D5.3</i> gene, an ortholog of MCOs in <i>C. elegans</i>. Heat map analysis indicated <i>F21D5.3</i> expression in the entero-rectal valve cells and both the anterior and posterior intestines.

IBM etiology has been elusive, due to both degenerative and autoimmune disease features found on muscle biopsy, and significant disease heterogeneity. Investigating the role of antibodies in the muscle of IBM patients may improve our understanding of disease pathogenesis. We used an IBM xenograft mouse model in which muscle biopsy tissue from IBM patients (n = 98) and controls (n = 131; including 54 from other types of myopathy) were implanted into immunodeficient mice (NOD-Rag1<sup>null</sup>-IL2rÎ³<sup>null</sup>). We quantified the amount of human IgG, IgA, and IgM in xenografted mouse sera using MesoScale Diagnostics (MSD) assay. We detected donor-derived antibody reactivities targeting autoantigens and infectious agents using Phage ImmunoPrecipitation Sequencing (PhIP-Seq). Finally, we used FR3 AmplifiKation Sequencing (FR3AK-Seq) to sequence the antibody mRNAs from a separate cohort of 146 patient biopsies (14 IBM, 22 healthy controls, 110 other myositis subtypes). With the MSD assay we found human IgG, IgA, and IgM in a larger percentage of IBM xenografted mice versus controls. Using PhIP-Seq, we found anti-microbial reactivities secreted from IBM muscle are prevalent amongst a healthy control population but autoantigen reactivities in IBM are more unique at the peptide and protein level. Additionally, NT5C1A (IgG/IgA and IgM) and TIF1Î³ (IgG/A) autoantibodies are secreted from muscle tissues of 4/18 and 10/18 IBM xenograft donors, respectively. Our characterization of antibody responses within the muscle of IBM patients reveals that muscle-infiltrating B cells produce both disease-associated autoantibodies and a broad spectrum of antibodies targeting non-self antigens."

    "abstract": "During infection, foreign DNA is sensed by cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) leading to the production of cGAMP, STING-dependent type I interferon and proinflammatory cytokine expression, and autophagy. To prevent a response to self-DNA, cGAS activity is tightly regulated. Dysregulation of cGAS underpins interferonopathies, such as Aicardi-GoutiÃ¨res syndrome, as well as Lupus and neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's disease. Thus, cGAS and its product cGAMP are therapeutic targets. However, if cGAS functions independently of cGAMP signaling is undefined. Here, we identified an alternative signaling pathway that cGAS engages independent of cGAMP synthesis. We demonstrate that alternative cGAS signaling promotes hyperexpression of CXCL1 and enhanced neutrophil recruitment that facilitates viral dissemination during herpes simplex encephalitis. Our study reports of an alternative cGAS response independent of cGAMP, highlighting a previously uncharacterized scaffold function for cGAS."

The surgeon or their designee should routinely follow up to assess and document outcomes of sinus surgery for chronic rhinosinusitis, between 3 and 12 months after the procedure, through history (symptom relief, quality of life, complications, adherence to therapy, need for rescue medications, and ongoing care) and nasal endoscopy (KAS 11). There were no recommendations that were considered options from the Guideline Development Group."

    "abstract": "Sensorineural hearing loss has a high disease burden and requires close follow-up to manage long-term sequelae of the disease. This study aims to identify patient- and appointment-related factors including demographic data and medical comorbities associated with sensorineural hearing loss follow-up appointment attendance in adults to better understand barriers to care. Retrospective chart review. Tertiary-care, safety-net hospital. Adult patients seen in an otolaryngology clinic for sensorineural hearing loss between May 1, 2015, and December 31, 2021. Analysis of patient demographic, medical comorbidity, and appointment factors. Follow-up appointment attendance rates for otolaryngology and audiology appointments. Of 5,632 patients, 54.9% attended, 28.7% canceled, and 16.3% were no-show at follow-up appointments. On univariate analysis, factors associated with appointment cancellation and no-show included sex, race, language, education, employment status, insurance, country of birth, housing insecurity, hypertension, smoking status, timing of appointments before or after the beginning of COVID-19, and having a physician within hospital network. In multivariate analysis, factors significantly associated with appointment nonattendance included age greater than 60 years old, higher education levels, unemployment, housing insecurity, having a primary care physician outside the hospital network, and residing outside a 5-mile radius of the hospital. Patient and appointment characteristics such as age, education level, employment status, housing insecurity, and distance to appointment had an independent association with higher rates of missed follow-up appointments in sensorineural hearing loss. Accessibility of appointments and interventions such as telehealth and reminder systems may be key to ensuring equitable care."

    "abstract": "To improve understanding of indications and outcomes for cardiac surgery for rheumatic aortic valvular disease in the young. Single institution retrospective cohort aged < 18 years with rheumatic heart disease who underwent surgery for isolated rheumatic aortic valve disease between 2000 and 2019. Baseline, intermediate follow-up, and late follow-up data were collected. Left ventricular (LV) dysfunction defined as LV ejection fraction < 55% or LV shortening fraction < 27%. Thirty-nine patients who were 8 to 18 years of age were included (median age 14 years), weighing 27 to 157 kg (median 78 kg) with follow up of 2 to 15 years (median 7 years). Index operations were valve repair 6 of 39 (15%), valve replacement 33 of 39 (84%) with homograft (n = 20), and mechanical valve (13). The 30-day mortality was zero. Overall mortality was 8 of 39 (20%); 17 of 39 (43%) underwent reoperation. At intermediate and late follow up, 27% (7/26) and 53% (18/34) had persistent dysfunction, respectively. Baseline LV dysfunction increased the risk of death (hazard ratio 13.3 [1.52-115.5], <i>P</i> = .003), which increased adjusting for higher body surface area (BSA). All those with baseline weight > 105 kg either died or had LV dysfunction at late follow up (<i>P</i> = .001). Freedom from late valve-related complications at 5, 10, and 15 years was 72%, 31%, and 23%, respectively. Preoperative LV dysfunction is associated with an increased risk of death for pediatric patients undergoing isolated rheumatic aortic valve surgery. This risk increases further, adjusting for BSA. There was a high rate of reoperations and late complications."

    "abstract": "Wilson disease (WD) is a rare, autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism. Although hepatic and neuropsychiatric manifestations are common, thrombotic events such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) are exceedingly rare, particularly in pediatric patients. We present the case of an 11-year-old girl diagnosed with WD who developed an acute left upper limb DVT shortly two months after diagnosis. Laboratory and imaging findings confirmed hepatic involvement and coagulopathy. Genetic testing revealed a heterozygous Factor V Leiden mutation and MTHFR heterozygosity; both may have contributed to the thrombotic episode. Careful monitoring of WD was prioritized, and appropriate treatment plans were established during diagnosis to achieve satisfactory outcomes and prevent future thrombotic sequences. This case emphasizes the importance of early recognition of thrombotic complications and coagulopathy management in pediatric WD."

    "abstract": "Lack of employment is associated with a poorer prognosis when compared to employment in the general population. Whether this association is present in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and similarly extends to adverse cardiovascular outcomes in those with CAD remains unknown. Herein, we analyzed the association of employment status and adverse outcomes in patients with CAD. Non-retired participants enrolled in the Emory Cardiovascular Biobank during the years 2003-2023 were divided into employed and non-employed cohorts and analyzed for the primary composite outcome of cardiovascular death or non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) by competing-risk regression, while accounting for non-cardiovascular death. The secondary outcome of all-cause death was assessed by Cox regression. Sensitivity analyses were performed to explore for heterogeneity of effect. The study sample consisted of 2809 participants with a mean age of 57 years, 35 % women, and 27 % Black. During a median follow-up of 5.1 years, 406 (14 %) cardiovascular death or non-fatal MI events and 537 (19 %) all-cause death events occurred. After adjustment for demographics, educational attainment level (EAL), and traditional cardiovascular risk factors, non-employment was found to be a significant predictor of cardiovascular death or non-fatal MI (sHR 1.78, 95 % CI 1.41-2.19, <i>P</i> < 0.001) and all-cause death (HR 2.46, 95 % CI 2.02-2.99, <i>P</i> < 0.001), when compared to employed participants. Non-employment is associated with adverse outcomes in non-retired individuals with CAD, independent of demographics, EAL, and traditional cardiovascular risk factors. Non-employment due to disability was associated with the highest risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes, highlighting a particularly vulnerable subgroup."

Immediate transfer to a dedicated intensive care unit (ICU) and evaluation for high-urgency liver transplantation (HU-LTx) is recommended to maximize chances of survival. Data on ALF epidemiology are limited, particularly for Central Europe. This retrospective single-center study included all ALF patients admitted to the ICU of the Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology at the Vienna General Hospital between 2012 and 2024. Overall, 31 patients (median age of 44 [interquartile range, IQR 32-56] years, 20 [65%] female) were included. The primary causes of ALF were viral infections (n = 8; 26%), autoimmune hepatitis (n = 5; 16%), drug-induced liver injury (DILI; n = 3; 10%), and Wilson's disease (n = 4; 13%), while in 8 patients (26%) no cause was identified. Median length of ICU stay was 12 (IQR 4-21) days, with mean sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) and simplified acute physiology score II (SAPS II) scores of 10.55 Â± 4.56 and 40.97 Â± 14.84. Overall ICU survival was 61% (n = 19). Non-HU-LTx patients (n = 18) had an ICU survival of 44%. HU-LTx was performed in 13 patients (42%), with 12 patients (92%) surviving 28 days. The 6âmonth overall survival of HU-LTx patients was 85%. The diverse causes of ALF in Central Europe include most commonly viral infections, autoimmune hepatitis, and DILI. HU-LTx was required and performed in almost half of patients and was associated with favorable survival rates, underscoring the importance of ICU management and early transfer to liver transplantation centers in the management of ALF."

    "abstract": "Mowat-Wilson syndrome (MOWS) is a congenital disease characterized by intellectual disability, delayed motor development, characteristic facial features, epilepsy, and a wide spectrum of neurocristopathies. MOWS is caused by de novo heterozygous loss-of-function mutations or deletions in the zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox2 (ZEB2) gene, which is a multifunctional regulator of neuronal development and cancer progression/metastasis through epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. We recognized that patients with MOWS have brown to red hair. In the present study, we report that hair from patients with MOWS has reduced eumelanin and elevated pheomelanin contents, resulting in an increased pheomelanin-to-eumelanin ratio. Furthermore, ZEB2-mutated human epidermal melanocytes show a predominance of pheomelanin biosynthesis over eumelanin and decreased expression of SLC45A2, the gene responsible for oculocutaneous albinism 4. Our results suggest that ZEB2 plays a role in mixed melanogenesis by regulating the melanosomal ion transporter gene, SLC45A2."

Chronic transfusion therapy has been established for primary and secondary prevention of CVA in SCD, resulting in a notable reduction in CVA incidence. For individuals with SCD presenting with CVA, the impact of acute management on neurological outcomes is not well studied. Herein, we examine the neurological outcomes of 29 children and adults with SCD who received acute red cell exchange (RCE) as primary therapy for neurological events at a single institution. Twelve (41%) individuals had a prior history of CVA, and 12 (41%) were on chronic transfusions. Among 13 adults, 3 (23%) had a history of diabetes and 4 (31%) had a history of hypertension. One adult (7.7%) received thrombolytic therapy; the remainder were ineligible due to age, timing of presentation, intracranial haemorrhage or transient symptoms. Higher post-RCE haematocrit was associated with decreased odds of death or persistent neurological symptoms at hospital discharge (OR 0.69, 95% CI: 0.45-0.94, p = 0.017). Optimal acute management of adults living with SCD presenting with CVA remains an understudied yet important topic. Future prospective studies may determine how best to tailor acute management to improve neurological outcomes."

    "abstract": "Accurately determining the sample size (\"N\") of a dataset is a key consideration for experimental design. Misidentification of sample size can lead to pseudoreplication, a process of artificially inflating the number of experimental replicates which systematically underestimates variability, overestimates effect sizes and invalidates statistical tests performed on the data. While many journals have adopted stringent requirements with regard to statistical reporting over the last decade, it remains unknown whether such efforts have had a meaningful impact on statistical rigour. Here, we evaluated the prevalence of this type of statistical error among neuroscience studies involving animal models of Fragile-X Syndrome (FXS) and those using animal models of neurological disorders at large published between 2001 and 2024. We found that pseudoreplication was present in the majority of publication, increasing over time despite marked improvements in statistical reporting over the last decade. This trend generalised beyond the FXS literature to rodent studies of neurological disorders at large between 2012 and 2024, suggesting that pseudoreplication remains a widespread issue in the literature. The scope of this study was limited to rodent-model studies of neurological disorders which had the potential for being pseudoreplicated, by allowing repeat observations from individual animals. We did not consider reviews or articles whose experimental design could not allow for pseudoreplication, for example studies which reported only behavioural results, or studies which did not use inferential statistics. These observations identify an urgent need for better standards in experimental design and increased vigilance for this type of error during peer review. While reporting standards have significantly improved over the past two decades, this alone has not been enough to curb the prevalence of pseudoreplication. We offer suggestions for how this can be remedied as well as quantifying the severity of this particular type of statistical error. Although the examined literature concerns a specific neuroscience-related area of research, the implications of pseudoreplication apply to all fields of empirical research."

    "abstract": "The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) acts as a critical signaling hub that connects immune cells, food and environmental cues, and microbiota to regulate intestinal homeostasis. In the current study, the role of AhR in the regulation of an antimicrobial peptide, Î²-defensin1 (BD-1) is investigated to control colitis. Human patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), and mice with three different models of colitis, express a significant decrease in the expression of BD-1 in colonic epithelial cells (CECs). Dietary and environmental AhR ligands induce the expression of BD-1 in CECs through the activation of two dioxin-responsive elements (DREs) expressed on its promoter. AhR ligands attenuate colitis in wild-type (WT) mice while inducing BD-1. However, AhR ligands fail to induce BD-1 and protect mice from colitis when there is an intestinal epithelial cell (IEC)-specific deletion of AhR. Blocking BD1 in vivo using antibodies prevents the ability of AhR ligands to ameliorate colitis, restore dysbiosis, and attenuate colonic inflammation. The current study identifies a novel pathway involving dietary, environmental, and endogenous AhR ligands to induce the antimicrobial peptide BD-1 in IECs, which in turn, plays a critical role in the regulation of intestinal homeostasis."

    "abstract": "We previously demonstrated that single-domain amnestic mild cognitive impairment (SDAm-MCI) detected through longitudinal neuropsychological testing in our research cohort is less severe than in clinically incident symptomatic individuals. This study aims to replicate and expand this work using a National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center dataset. Participants were classified into two groups: those enrolled with normal cognition (Normal Enrollees) and those enrolled with SDAm-MCI (Amnestic Enrollees). Groups were compared at the time of diagnosis and on rates of cognitive decline post-diagnosis. At SDAm-MCI diagnosis, Normal Enrollees were 17% to 39% less impaired on memory tasks, after which the slope of change over time steepened compared to their pre-symptomatic change and was steeper than in Amnestic Enrollees. Incident MCI detected through longitudinal neuropsychological testing is initially milder but may progress more steeply than in clinically established MCI. Sensitive assessment of cognitive decline is essential for capturing early changes that are more likely to be amenable to therapeutic treatment. Longitudinal cognitive evaluation detects symptomatic Alzheimer's disease earlier than mental status exams. At the time of diagnosis, converters were less impaired compared to initially symptomatic patients. Converters' cognition declined more steeply than initially symptomatic patients. Sensitive cognitive tests are essential to capture early changes, given new disease-modifying therapies."

Subsamples had creatinine (n = 137) and positron emission tomography (PET; amyloid-PET = 65 [amyloid-PET-positive = 16/65]; tau-PET = 70). We tested whether p-tau217 (ALZPath, Inc.) varied by medical condition and amyloid- and tau-PET-positivity status and assessed the diagnostic accuracy of p-tau217. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <60 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and amyloid- and tau-PET-positive status demonstrated higher p-tau217. Effect sizes (r<sub>pb</sub>): eGFR <60 group = 0.48, CVD = 0.25, amyloid-PET-positive status = 0.54; tau-PET-positive status = 0.56. Lower eGFR was related to higher p-tau217 when adjusting for amyloid-PET. For abnormal amyloid-PET and tau-PET, p-tau217 exhibited areas under the curve of 0.90 and 0.89, respectively. Plasma p-tau217 showed promise as an Alzheimer's biomarker in Black adults; however, kidney function and CVD should be considered when interpreting levels. Plasma tau phosphorylated at threonine 217 (p-tau217) was tested in a sample of Black middle-aged and older adults. Level of p-tau217 was higher in impaired kidney function and cardiovascular disease. Obesity and diabetes were not related to p-tau217.

Greater progress was observed where there was political will and the production of diagnostics coincided with industrial policy goals, also in areas where changing the legal and health policy frameworks was involved. Progress was slower on recommendations with substantial resource implications (eg, labour force, affordability, and diagnostics for conflict situations). It is expected that the Global Diagnostics Coalition will consolidate and accelerate progress."

A new approach is needed for characterising TBI more accurately. In 2022, the US National Institutes of Health-National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke launched an international initiative to address this need, with a focus on the acute phase of injury. Six working groups of TBI experts, implementation scientists, people with lived experience, and federal partners were established, involving 94 participants from 14 countries. The proposed new framework for the characterisation of acute TBI incorporates four pillars: a clinical pillar (full GCS and pupillary reactivity); a biomarker pillar (blood-based measures); an imaging pillar (pathoanatomical measures); and a modifier pillar (features influencing clinical presentation and outcome; CBI-M). The CBI-M framework provides a multidimensional characterisation of TBI to inform individualised clinical management and to improve scientific rigor. Research priorities include validation of the CBI-M framework, evaluation of its applicability beyond the acute phase of TBI, and strategies for clinical implementation."

    "abstract": "Wilson disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder that results in excessive hepatic copper, causing hepatic steatosis, inflammation, fibrosis, cirrhosis, and liver failure. Previous studies have revealed dysregulation of many farnesoid X receptor (FXR) metabolic target genes in WD, including the bile salt exporter pump, the major determinant of bile flow. We tested the hypothesis that the FXR-cistrome is decreased in Atp7b-/- mice in accord with dysregulated bile acid homeostasis. FXR binding within Atp7b-/- mouse livers displayed surprising complexity: FXR binding was increased in distal intergenic regions but decreased in promoter regions in Atp7b-/- versus wild-type mice. Decreased FXR occupancy in Atp7b-/- versus wild-type mice was observed in hepatocyte metabolic and bile acid homeostasis pathways, while enrichment of FXR binding was observed in pathways associated with cellular damage outside of hepatocytes. Indeed, disparate FXR occupancy was identified in parenchymal and non-parenchymal marker genes in a manner that suggests decreased FXR activity in parenchymal cells, as expected, and increased FXR activity in non-parenchymal cells. Consistent with altered FXR function, serum and liver bile acid concentrations were higher in Atp7b-/- mice than in wild-type mice. Comparison of bile acid profiles in the serum of WD patients with \"liver,\" \"neurological,\" or \"mixed\" disease versus healthy controls also revealed increases in specific bile acids in WD-liver versus healthy controls. We identified novel FXR-occupancy across the genome that varied in parenchymal and non-parenchymal cells, demonstrating complex FXR regulation of metabolic and hepatocellular stress pathways in Atp7b-/- mice. Dynamic changes in FXR activity support our novel finding of altered bile acid metabolism in Atp7b-/- mice and WD patients."

These antibodies are known to be an important xenotransplantation barrier, but the full implications of these antibodies to health and disease remain incompletely understood. By contrast, IgE to alpha-gal is uncommon in the population but has been associated with tick bites and causally linked with mammalian meat allergy, often now known as alpha-gal syndrome (AGS). To date, there have been few population-based studies that have investigated alpha-gal IgG levels in relation to demographic factors, diet, tick bites, and mammalian meat allergy. <b>Methods:</b> Adults, predominantly healthcare workers, were recruited for a COVID-19 vaccine study. At least one serum sample was collected, and subjects completed questionnaires to provide demographic, diet, and tick exposure data. Alpha-gal IgG, IgE, and total IgG were measured using the ImmunoCAP platform, and blood group was assessed via reverse typing using stored serum. We also assessed alpha-gal IgG levels among subjects with AGS, recruited from an allergy clinic. <b>Results:</b> The median age of the 267 subjects in the vaccine cohort was 42 years, and median alpha-gal IgG levels were 3.0 Î¼g/mL. Alpha-gal IgG levels were higher among the 43 (16.1%) subjects who had alpha-gal IgE sensitization (â¥0.1 IU/mL) and among subjects lacking the B blood group antigen (blood groups A and O). Alpha-gal IgG levels did not differ between the subjects who had asymptomatic alpha-gal IgE sensitization and those who had meat allergy. However, both groups had higher alpha-gal IgG levels than subjects who lacked alpha-gal IgE sensitization. Subjects who reported prior tick or chigger bites had higher alpha-gal IgG levels than those without a bite history, regardless of alpha-gal IgE sensitization status. <b>Conclusions:</b> In a population-based cohort, alpha-gal IgG antibodies were found to be prevalent, and levels were increased in subjects with blood groups A and O, subjects who were alpha-gal IgE sensitized, and those who reported a history of tick bites."

The 12-Item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) has shown the best fit in both a one-factor structure and a multidimensional structure for the screening of common mental disorders and psychiatric well-being. The aim was to test for reliability and validity and ascertain the factor structure of the GHQ-12 in a South African HCW population. Data were collected from 832 public hospital and clinic staff during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in Gauteng, South Africa. The factor structure of the GHQ-12 in this professional population was examined by exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to identify factors, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) for construct validity and structural equation modelling (SEM) to establish model fit. The GHQ-12 median score was higher (<i>n</i> = 25) in women than in men (<i>n</i> = 24), <i>p</i> = 0.044. The assumptions for inferential statistics were tested: the determinant for the correlation matrix was 0.034, Bartlett's test of sphericity was <i>p</i> < 0.001, Chi-square 2262.171 and the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) of sampling adequacy was 0.877.

Few studies have comprehensively and longitudinally assessed health outcomes for people with long COVID following mild/moderate infection. We applied the Wilson-Cleary model of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) to describe the impact of long COVID on multiple health dimensions up to 24 months following mild/moderate COVID-19. Participants within the ADAPT post-COVID study (N = 172, 86% mild/moderate infection) completed structured patient-reported outcome measures at 4, 8, 12, 18, and 24 months postinfection. Following the Wilson-Cleary model, questionnaires assessed symptoms (anxiety/depression, chronic fatigue, breathlessness), return to pre-COVID-19 functioning, perceived health status (EuroQol Visual Analogue Scale), and wellbeing (EuroQol EQ-5D-5L, Personal Wellbeing Index). Temporal trends were assessed using general estimating equations and ordinal logistic regression, including time Ã long COVID interactions. Thirty-seven percent of participants were diagnosed with long COVID (â¥1 new/persisting symptoms of chest pain, breathlessness, or fatigue/malaise at least 12 weeks after infection). Long COVID was associated with poorer health outcomes across all domains at first assessment. Over 2 years, participants with long COVID reported improvement in return to pre-COVID-19 work and Somatic and Psychological Health Report chronic fatigue but sustained impairment was observed in all other health domains, compared to participants recovered from COVID-19. Substantial long-term impairment in various health domains were observed for individuals with long COVID following mild/moderate initial infection, with little improvement over time in most. Multimodal interventions must address impairment in multiple domains of HRQOL in individuals with long COVID."

(2024) found that CWD detection dogs trained on fecal matter can differentiate between CWD-positive and CWD-negative training aids, including cotton aids, which are inexpensive and simple to use. However, as most dogs in an applied setting would instead be trained on aids and tasked with finding actual fecal matter in the field, this study examined 1) the extent to which dogs initially trained on CWD-incubated cotton can discriminate between fecal samples from CWD-positive and CWD-negative deer; and 2) the impact of substrate form (cotton ball or cotton roll) on the dogs' detection accuracy. Results show that dogs (n = 5) maintained an accuracy of >80% during training while discriminating between cotton ball training aids that had been incubated (noncontact) with deer fecal samples confirmed as either CWD-positive or CWD-negative. When tested with cotton ball training aids incubated with novel samples, dogs (n = 4) showed 73% sensitivity and 77% specificity. When presented with deer fecal samples, dogs showed a sensitivity of 50% and a specificity of 90%. The type of cotton (ball or roll) did not significantly influence performance. In sum, cotton aids can be used to train dogs to detect the CWD odor profile effectively. However, an initial reduction in sensitivity suggests that integrating exposure to target fecal matter may enhance detection performance."

    "abstract": "To compare the postoperative pulmonary complications (PPC) after minimally invasive or open transthoracic esophagectomy for esophageal cancer in an international, multicenter cohort. Ongoing debate exists around the optimal surgical approach for esophageal cancer, with limited data assessing the external validity of randomised trials on outcomes of MIE METHODS: Patients undergoing open (OE, n = 744), hybrid (HE, n = 500), and totally minimally invasive esophagectomy (TMIE, n = 540) for esophageal cancer were identified from the international, prospective Oesophagogastric Anastomosis Audit (OGAA). Multivariable models were used to investigate PPC (primary outcome) as well as overall complications, major complications, anastomotic leak and 90-day mortality (secondary outcomes). PPC rates were lower after TMIE compared to OE and HE (28% vs 37% vs 39%, p = 0.002), even on adjusted analyses compared to OE (odds ratio (OR): 0.60, CI<sub>95%</sub>: 0.45-0.78). TMIE was also associated with significantly lower overall complications (OR: 0.68, CI<sub>95%</sub>: 0.52-0.88) compared to OE, but not for major complications (OR: 0.90, CI<sub>95%</sub>: 0.67-1.21), anastomotic leak (OR: 1.39, CI<sub>95%</sub>: 0.96-2.01) and 90-day mortality (OR: 0.49, CI<sub>95%</sub>: 0.22-1.04). Sensitivity analyses by underlying respiratory disease, neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy or high-volume centers confirmed above findings. This study provides real-world data that TMIE was associated with lower 90-day PPC than OE and HE approaches, especially in patients with underlying respiratory disease or receiving neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. These warrant a further review into causes and mechanisms in selected patients, and that quality assurance in delivery of TMIE is probably of major importance. The ideal surgical approach remains unclear, and ongoing trials will provide more evidence within a few years that may clarify the optimum approach to locally advanced esophageal cancers."

    "title": "Imagine your immune system is a sports team: Language expectancies in the use of physician analogies and jargon.",
    "abstract": "The study examined how physicians' use of analogies, literal language, or medical jargon influences patient attitudes towards health recommendations and perceptions of physician trustworthiness by considering language's alignment or deviation from patient expectations and subsequent evaluations. A 3 (physician language: analogies, jargon, literal language) x 2 (health topic: coronary artery disease, influenza vaccine) experiment tested the role of communication unexpectedness and evaluations on patient attitudes and physician trustworthiness. Participants (N = 545) recruited online were instructed to imagine themselves as patients interacting with the physician in a randomly assigned video, in which the physician explained medical information and provided a health recommendation. Participants then reported their attitudes toward the recommended behavior and their perceptions of the physician's trustworthiness. The physician's use of analogies or jargon was more unexpected than literal language. Jargon was evaluated more negatively, but analogies were evaluated similarly to literal language. Language type had significant indirect effects on attitudes and perception of physician through unexpectedness, moderated by patient evaluation of communication. When participants evaluated physicians' communication positively, literal language led to the best outcomes, while jargon led to the worst outcomes through higher unexpectedness. When participants evaluated the style neutrally, jargon resulted in the best outcomes through higher unexpectedness, while literal language led to the worst outcomes. This study highlights the crucial and contingent role of patient expectations and evaluations in shaping the outcomes of physician language strategies. Our findings underscore the complexity of language choice, demonstrating that unexpected communication, even when evaluated positively, may reduce its intended persuasive effect. Healthcare professionals should assess patient preferences when making their language choice. Interventions that train physicians to recognize and respond to patient expectations should ensure more tailored and effective communication approaches, ultimately enhancing patient trust, comprehension, and adherence to medical recommendations."

    "abstract": "Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at increased risk of ischemic stroke (IS) and intracerebral hemorrhage, so the safety and efficacy of early direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) initiation in those with CKD are of interest. OPTIMAS was a multicenter, randomized, parallel-group, open-label trial with blinded outcome assessment, recruiting patients with IS and atrial fibrillation from 100 UK hospitals between 2019 and 2024. Participants were randomized 1:1, stratified by stroke severity, to early (within 4 days of onset) or delayed (at days 7-14) DOAC initiation. CKD was defined as a past medical history of known CKD, collected according to trial protocol as part of the case report form. For this prespecified subgroup analysis, the trial cohorts were classified according to the presence or absence of CKD. Whether CKD modified the treatment effect of early DOAC initiation was determined by fitting mixed effects logistic regression models with interaction terms between CKD and treatment group. The primary outcome was a composite outcome of recurrent IS, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, and systemic arterial embolism. Key secondary outcomes included the individual components of the primary outcome and all-cause mortality. We included 3601 patients (mean age, 78Â±10 years; 45% female), 543 with CKD. There were 116 primary outcome events: 97 (3.2%) in the normal kidney function group and 19 (3.5%) in the CKD group. There was no difference between early and delayed DOAC initiation for the primary outcome in either the normal kidney function group (odds ratio, 1.01 [95% CI, 0.67-1.51]) or the CKD group (odds ratio, 0.90 [95% CI, 0.36-2.25]; <i>P</i><sub>interaction</sub>=0.822). Similarly, for the secondary outcomes, we detected no modification of the treatment effect according to CKD (<i>P</i><sub>interaction</sub> values of 0.637, 0.386, and 0.107 for IS, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, and all-cause mortality, respectively). Our findings suggest that CKD does not modify the effects of early versus delayed DOAC initiation after acute IS. Based on these results, early DOAC initiation should not be withheld in patients with CKD. URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; Unique identifier: NCT03759938."

    "abstract": "Intergenerational trauma has profound impacts on the health of American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) populations, contributing to high rates of chronic disease and reduced life expectancy. Despite growing scientific recognition of these effects, medical education often fails to address the unique health challenges and sociopolitical issues faced by Tribal Nations. This gap in curricula leaves providers with limited understanding of AI/AN health disparities, perpetuating inequities in care. We developed a workshop on intergenerational trauma in AI/AN populations, featuring a case-based learning module, original videos, and interactive reflection exercises to enhance knowledge in a supportive environment. The workshop includes an introduction to AI/AN history, the transmission of intergenerational trauma, the Missing and Murdered Indigenous People (MMIP) crisis, and available resources. The workshop was successfully delivered to 46 participants. Comparison of pre- and postworkshop survey responses using paired-samples <i>t</i> test and chi-square test for independence revealed a significantly increased percentage of correct answer selection in response to two of four prompts (<i>p</i> < .01) and a significant improvement in familiarity with Indigenous resources (<i>p</i> < .01). Participants commented that the skill-focused teaching and resources provided were helpful. This workshop addressed a gap in medical education curricula while providing critical context on the health impacts of intergenerational trauma on the AI/AN community, including an analysis of medicolegal barriers in addressing the MMIP crisis. We bring visibility to events that impact health outcomes of the AI/AN community while equipping providers with Indigenous resources to incorporate into their care of AI/AN patients."

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) and traumatic brain injury (TBI) are currently untreatable neurodegenerative disorders afflicting millions of people worldwide. These conditions are pathologically related, and TBI is one of the greatest risk factors for AD. Although blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption drives progression of both AD and TBI, strategies to preserve BBB integrity have been hindered by lack of actionable targets. Here, we identify 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH), an enzyme that catabolizes eicosanoids and other anti-inflammatory mediators, as a therapeutic candidate that protects the BBB. We demonstrate that 15-PGDH is enriched in BBB-associated myeloid cells and becomes markedly elevated in human and mouse models of AD and TBI, as well as aging, another major risk factor for AD. Pathological increase in 15-PGDH correlates with pronounced oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration, alongside profound BBB structural degeneration characterized by astrocytic endfeet swelling and functional impairment. Pharmacologic inhibition or genetic reduction of 15-PGDH in AD and TBI models strikingly mitigates oxidative damage, suppresses neuroinflammation, and restores BBB integrity. Most notably, inhibiting 15-PGDH not only halts neurodegeneration but also preserves cognitive function at levels indistinguishable from healthy controls. Remarkably, these neuroprotective effects in AD are achieved without affecting amyloid pathology, underscoring a noncanonical mechanism for treating AD. In a murine microglia cell line exposed to amyloid beta oligomer, major protection was demonstrated by multiple anti-inflammatory substrates that 15-PGDH degrades. Thus, our findings position 15-PGDH inhibition as a broad-spectrum strategy to protect the BBB and thereby preserve brain health and cognition in AD and TBI."

    "abstract": "Previous publications have reported that increased absolute monocyte counts are associated with treatment non-response in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This study investigated whether full blood count (FBC) components from routine clinical testing before treatment with a biological disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (bDMARD) were associated with treatment non-response after 6 months of treatment. From a UK-based prospective multicentre study of patients with RA starting a bDMARD, data from 246 patients attending five of the participating centres were retrieved. FBC components were analysed for their association with European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology non-response after 6 months of treatment using backward stepwise logistic regression, adjusting for potential confounders. Final models underwent resampling with 200 repeats of out-of-bag bootstrapping to assess model performance using area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUROC) curves. Model fit was compared using the Akaike information criterion (AIC). After 6 months of treatment, the only FBC component predictive of non-response was pretreatment absolute monocyte count [adjusted odds ratio (OR<sub>adj</sub>) 9.56, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 1.61-59.86, p = 0.01, AUROC = 60.42%). The model including monocytes as a predictor demonstrated superior performance to the covariates-only model (AIC 184.36 vs 188.51, respectively). In the largest study to date, increasing absolute monocyte counts were associated with bDMARD non-response after 6 months of treatment, replicating previous reports. Validation and mechanistic studies are required to inform future treatment selection."

    "abstract": "Use a new patient registry to characterize and predict progression of lower-extremity chronic wounds to amputation and/or death, while considering infection history. Chronic wounds are a common health issue causing amputation and death. The Regenstrief Chronic Wound Registry, created from one of the U.S.'s largest health information exchanges, can give insights into their epidemiology. This retrospective cohort study analyzed 52,916 patients first diagnosed with lower-extremity chronic wounds during 2011-2021, sourced from the registry of 152,237 chronic wound patients. Disease progression was modeled using a multistate model, tracking transitions from initial diagnosis to minor amputation, major amputation, and/or death. Cox proportional-hazards models assessed associations between time-dependent covariates, including infection history and wound type, and each state transition. Three-year pooled mortality rates after wound diagnosis, minor amputation, and major amputation were 10.71%, 13.38%, and 19.47%, respectively. The multistate model showed these associations: diabetic foot ulcer and increased minor amputation; venous ulcer and decreased amputation or death; pressure ulcer, decreased minor amputation, and increased death; osteomyelitis, increased amputation, and decreased death before major amputation; sepsis and increased death before major amputation. Simulated patients' individualized risks were estimated-e.g., probabilities of major amputation for diabetic White patients within three years after minor amputation, with and without prior osteomyelitis diagnosis, were 3.7% and 14.9% respectively. A multistate model, applied to a state-wide chronic wound patient registry, reveals insights into chronic wound disease progression, enables personalized prognoses for patients with chronic wounds, and has the potential to improve clinical decision-making."

    "abstract": "Renal medullary carcinoma (RMC) is an aggressive tumor associated with sickle cell trait. Despite treatment advances for other rare renal tumors, RMC survival remains poor. We aimed to describe the contemporary management and survival of children and adults with RMC. In this multicenter retrospective cohort study, Pediatric Surgical Oncology Research Collaborative sites searched their databases for patients diagnosed with RMC (2000-2022). Descriptive statistics were calculated and survival analyses performed using Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression. Thirty-four patients with RMC were identified. Median age was 19 years (IQR: 15-28; range: 7-52). Most were male (24/34; 71%), Black (27/32; 84%), had sickle cell trait or disease (30/33; 91%), presented with metastatic disease (27/34; 79%), and were symptomatic at presentation (32/34; 94%). Median overall survival (OS) was 24 months from diagnosis (16 months for children, 28 months for adults, p = 0.6). Receipt of platinum-based chemotherapy (23/34; 68%) was associated with significantly higher OS than other regimens (35 vs. 5 months, p < 0.001). Nephrectomy (24/34; 71%) was associated with significantly improved OS compared with non-operative management (34 vs. 7 months, p = 0.001). Immunotherapy, targeted therapy, or radiation therapy were not associated with significant differences in OS, nor were age, sex, race, sickle cell status, SMARCB1/INI-1, stage, nephrectomy approach, retroperitoneal lymph node dissection, gross residual disease, margins, or tumor size. RMC survival remains poor despite newer therapies. Nephrectomy and platinum-based chemotherapy should be considered in locally advanced and metastatic disease. Coordinated international cooperative group studies are needed to meaningfully improve RMC survival."

    "abstract": "Tooth decay is a leading cause of total disease burden among Australian children. In 2019, the state government of New South Wales, Australia implemented the Primary School Mobile Dental Program (PSMDP) across five local health districts. Understanding stakeholder satisfaction of the PSMDP is an important measure of quality, to determine appropriateness as relevant to the needs of populations. The aim of the study was to explore parent/caregiver and provider attitudes, experiences, and perceptions of the PSMDP. This study reports on the qualitative component of a mixed methods study examining parent/caregiver and provider (oral health staff) experiences of the program. Two of the five local health districts were selected for study sampling. Parents/caregivers were recruited using flyers administered via schools and oral health teams. Interviews were conducted between 2022 and 2023. The interviews lasted 20-60 min, were recorded, and transcribed verbatim. A critical realist lens was applied, and thematic analysis was conducted. Data saturation was achieved, and bias was reduced through member checking, researcher reflexivity, and team triangulation of the data. In total, 79 individuals (58 parents/caregivers and 21 providers) were interviewed. Analysis revealed six key themes: (1) oral healthcare access, (2) informed consent, (3) parental attendance, (4) rewarding experiences, (5) operational barriers, and (6) communication clarity. The PSMDP promoted oral healthcare access while some parents/caregivers reported informed consent challenges. Providers cited rewarding experiences but face operational barriers including time constraints. Stakeholders diverged on parental attendance at school dental appointments, and most importantly, parents/caregivers requested follow-up communication clarity and coordination, particularly in feedback letters. Qualitative findings identified generally positive attitudes and experiences with the PSMDP, and implications have been identified that would support the scale-up and sustainability of the PSMDP across the state. Study insights could be useful for similar programs, such as extending the attendance time per child, giving greater consideration to parental involvement, and improving communication and follow-up coordination."

    "abstract": "Stereotactic arrhythmia radiotherapy (STAR) has emerged as a potential therapy for treatment-refractory ventricular tachycardia (VT). However, the mechanisms underlying STAR efficacy, such as scar or other electromechanical changes, are still unclear. The goal of this study was to develop a translational porcine model of ischemic monomorphic VT treated with STAR to examine the physiological changes after a typical clinical STAR treatment. We treated a previously validated porcine model of monomorphic VT after myocardial infarction with a clinically derived STAR protocol. A dose of 25 Gy was prescribed to the planning target volume and 35 Gy to the clinical target volume (regions of scar), while controls underwent a sham STAR treatment. All investigators in the study were blinded except the treating investigator. The primary study outcome was VT inducibility at 6 weeks post-STAR. Animals underwent pre- and post-STAR cardiac magnetic resonance imaging to quantify myocardial scar and function, as well as body surface mapping. Six weeks post-STAR, animals underwent a VT induction study, and tissue was harvested for optical mapping and histological analysis. Six animals completed the study, which ended before finishing enrollment because all animals had inducible VT. We found a significantly longer local effective refractory period in the left ventricular apex and longer VT cycle lengths in STAR-treated animals compared with controls (<i>P</i><0.05). We found no difference in myocardial scar burden, mechanical function, or body surface recordings when comparing pre- and post-STAR. Our data suggest a novel therapeutic mechanism of STAR driven by increasing the effective refractory period in locally treated areas, corresponding to increased tissue wavelength. Our results corroborate clinical case reports and anecdotal evidence that STAR increases VT cycle length. Importantly, these effects were not mediated by an increase in myocardial scar burden. However, our studies do not examine the long-term effects of STAR."

    "abstract": "Current surveillance of diarrhoeal disease is hindered by limitations of traditional diagnostic approaches, which often fail to identify the causative organism, particularly for novel or hard-to-culture bacterial pathogens. Sequencing nucleic acids directly from stool can overcome such constraints, but such approaches need to reliably detect pathogens identifiable by conventional methods. As part of the INTEGRATE study, we analysed stool microbiomes from 1067 patients with gastroenteritis symptoms using direct sequencing, and compared findings with standard diagnostic techniques (culture, immunoassay, microscopy, and single-target PCR) and molecular assays (Luminex xTAG GPP) for detection of bacterial and viral pathogens in the UK. We found strong positive correlations between metatranscriptomic reads and traditional diagnostics for six out of 15 pathogens. The metatranscriptomic data were highly correlated with the Luminex assay for eight out of 14 pathogens. In contrast, metagenomic sequencing only showed a strong positive correlation with traditional diagnostics for three of 15 pathogens, and with Luminex for four of 14 pathogens. Compared with metagenomics, metatranscriptomics had increased sensitivity of detection for four pathogens, while metagenomics was more effective for detecting five pathogens. Metatranscriptomics gave near-complete transcriptome coverage for Human mastadenovirus F and detected Cryptosporidium via identification of Cryptosporidium parvum virus (CSpV1). A comprehensive transcriptomic profile of Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis was recovered from the stool of a patient with a laboratory-confirmed Salmonella infection. Furthermore, comparison of RNA/DNA ratios between pathogen-positive and pathogen-negative samples demonstrated that metatranscriptomics can distinguish pathogen-positive/negative samples and provide insights into pathogen biology. Higher RNA/DNA ratios were observed in samples that tested positive via gold-standard diagnostics. This study highlights the power of directly sequencing nucleic acids from human samples to augment gastrointestinal pathogen surveillance and clinical diagnostics. Metatranscriptomics was most effective for identifying a wide range of pathogens and showed superior sensitivity. We propose that metatranscriptomics should be considered for future diagnosis and surveillance of gastrointestinal pathogens. We assembled a rich data resource of paired metagenomic and metatranscriptomic datasets, direct from patient stool samples, and have made these data publicly available to enhance the understanding of pathogens associated with infectious intestinal diseases."

    "abstract": "An unmet clinical need requires the discovery of new treatments for men facing advanced prostate cancer. Aberrant glycosylation is a universal feature of cancer cells and plays a key role in tumour growth, immune evasion and metastasis. Alterations in tumour glycosylation are closely associated with prostate cancer progression, making glycans promising therapeutic targets. Fucosyltransferase 8 (FUT8) drives core fucosylation by adding Î±1,6-fucose to the innermost GlcNAc residue on N-glycans. While FUT8 is recognised as a crucial factor in cancer progression, its role in prostate cancer remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate using multiple independent clinical cohorts that FUT8 is upregulated in high grade and metastatic prostate tumours, and in the blood of prostate cancer patients with aggressive disease. Using novel tools, including PhosL lectin immunofluorescence and N-glycan MALDI mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI), we find FUT8 underpins the biosynthesis of malignant core fucosylated N-glycans in prostate cancer cells and using both in vitro and in vivo models, we find FUT8 promotes prostate tumour growth, cell motility and invasion. Mechanistically we show FUT8 regulates the expression of genes and signalling pathways linked to prostate cancer progression. Furthermore, we find that fucosylation inhibitors can inhibit the activity of FUT8 in prostate cancer to suppress the growth of prostate tumours. Our study cements FUT8-mediated core fucosylation as an important driver of prostate cancer progression and suggests targeting FUT8 activity for prostate cancer therapy as an exciting area to explore."

This document reviews updated evidence on interstitial lung abnormalities (ILA), provides suggestions for screening, evaluation, and management, proposes criteria for distinguishing ILA from ILD, and identifies research priorities. A committee of clinical and methodology experts met by video conference to define ILA and ILD by consensus and voted on eleven pre-specified questions after reviewing synthesized evidence from a systematic literature search. Agreement of 70% or more was required to approve each suggestion. ILA is defined as non-dependent bilateral parenchymal CT abnormalities, including ground-glass or reticulations, lung distortion, traction bronchiectasis, and/or honeycombing involving at least 5% of a lung zone. The updated definition removes prior exclusion of high-risk populations. ILD is distinguished from ILA by symptoms (dyspnea/cough) attributable to an interstitial process, abnormal or declining lung function, fibrotic (honeycombing and/or reticulation with traction bronchiectasis involving at least 5% of total lung volume) or progressive imaging abnormalities, and/or specific fibrotic ILD patterns on imaging or pathology. Suggestions include ILA/ILD assessment on imaging acquired for lung cancer screening, screening adults with connective tissue disease and first-degree relatives of patients with familial pulmonary fibrosis, assessing baseline symptoms and pulmonary function among those with ILA, and monitoring ILA with chest CT every 2-3 years. This document presents a comprehensive literature review of ILA with updates to the Fleischner Society ILA definition, establishes a working ILD definition, and provides evidence-based suggestions for ILA evaluation and management."

    "abstract": "The relationship between Parkinson's Disease (PD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is attracting increasing research interest. Epidemiological data shows a remarkable association between these two age-related diseases. Evidence is emerging to suggest a common pathological pathway linking PD and T2DM, involving factors such as altered insulin signalling, insulin resistance, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and misfolded protein accumulation. The precise mechanisms underlying this interplay, however, remain less clear, and are likely to be bidirectional. The aim of this review was to examine the epidemiological association between PD and T2DM, summarise potential common mechanisms, and evaluate the role of antidiabetic medications in the treatment and prevention of PD progression. A deeper understanding of the shared pathophysiological pathways between PD and T2DM may pave the way for novel therapeutic approaches for patients with both diseases. Research into antidiabetic drugs, particularly GLP-1 receptor agonists, shows promise in potentially modifying the progression of PD. Investigation of the common pathophysiological mechanisms of PD and T2DM may lead to new treatment strategies for both diseases. Ongoing studies of the efficacy and safety of antidiabetic drugs in PD, particularly in larger populations, are essential to validate their long-term benefits and therapeutic potential."

However, at the time this study was initiated, there had been no randomised controlled trials confirming or refuting this. To determine the clinical and cost-effectiveness of adding bisoprolol (maximal dose 5 mg once daily) to usual chronic obstructive pulmonary disease therapies in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease at high risk of exacerbation. A multicentre, pragmatic, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Seventy-six United Kingdom primary and secondary care sites. People aged â¥ 40 years with a diagnosis of at least moderately severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with a history of at least two exacerbations in the previous year. Participants were randomised (1 : 1) to receive either bisoprolol or placebo for 1 year. During a 4- to 7-week titration period, the maximum tolerated dose was established (1.25 mg, 2.5 mg, 3.75 mg, 5 mg once daily). A number of participant-reported exacerbations during the 1-year treatment period. In total, 519 participants were recruited and randomised. Four post-randomisation exclusions left 259 in the bisoprolol group and 256 in the placebo group. Treatment groups were balanced at baseline: mean (standard deviation) age 68 (7.9) years; 53% men; mean (standard deviation) pack year smoking history 45 (25.2); mean (standard deviation) 3.5 (1.9) exacerbations in previous year. Primary outcome data were available for 99.8% of participants (bisoprolol 259, placebo 255). The mean (standard deviation) number of exacerbations was 2.03 (1.91) in the bisoprolol group and 2.01 (1.75) in the placebo group (adjusted incidence rate ratio 0.97, 95% confidence interval 0.84 to 1.13), <i>p</i> = 0.72. The number of participants with serious adverse events was similar between the two groups (bisoprolol 37, placebo 36). The total number of adverse reactions was also similar between the two groups. As expected, bisoprolol was associated with a higher proportion of vascular adverse reactions (e.g. hypotension, cold peripheries) than placebo, but was not associated with an excess of other adverse reactions, including those classified as respiratory. Adding bisoprolol resulted in a statistically insignificant trend towards higher costs (Â£636, 95% confidence interval Â£118 to Â£1391) and fewer quality-adjusted life-years (0.035, 95% confidence interval 0.059 to 0.010) compared to placebo. The study findings should be interpreted with caution as the target sample size of 1574 was not achieved because the funder considered the study to be unviable in the COVID-19 pandemic clinical research environment. Although 28% of participants did not initiate bisoprolol/placebo (1.6%) or ceased during the treatment period (26.2%), this is consistent with similar trials in the United Kingdom. In this underpowered study, the addition of bisoprolol to usual chronic obstructive pulmonary disease treatment did not reduce the likelihood of exacerbations, and bisoprolol cannot be recommended as a treatment for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

With the advancements in diagnostic and treatment technologies, an increasing number of children with inherited metabolic diseases are surviving into adolescence and adulthood. These advancements have improved our understanding of the IMLD disease spectrum and clinical outcomes. This study aimed to analyze changes in the disease spectrum and epidemiological characteristics of inherited metabolic liver diseases (IMLD) over the past 20 years in two specialized liver disease hospitals in northern China. A retrospective analysis was conducted on IMLD cases diagnosed between January 1, 2002, and December 31, 2023, at two liver disease specialty hospitals in Beijing. Data were obtained from inpatient and outpatient hospital information systems, with diagnoses based on national and international IMLD diagnosis and treatment guidelines. A total of 2,103 IMLD patients were analyzed, including 1,213 adults and 890 children. IMLD accounted for 4.58â° of hospitalized liver disease patients during this period. The most common IMLD was Wilson's disease, comprising 68% of all IMLD cases. The number of diagnosed IMLD types increased from 15 to 32 across two 11-year periods (2002-2012 and 2013-2023). Among pediatric patients, glycogen storage disease and Alagille syndrome were more prevalent in those under one year of age, while Wilson's disease was prevalent across all age groups. In adult IMLD patients, Wilson's disease, polycystic liver disease, and hereditary hyperbilirubinemia were more frequently observed. Over the past 20 years, both the number of diagnosed IMLD cases and disease diversity have significantly increased, with Wilson's disease remaining the most prevalent IMLD. These findings provide valuable insights for the long-term management of IMLD patients and the allocation of healthcare resources."

    "title": "A single-cell transcriptomic atlas of immune cells in Wilson disease identifies copper-specific immune regulation.",
    "abstract": "Wilson disease (WD) is caused by mutations of the copper-transporting gene, <i>ATP7B</i>, leading to abnormal copper metabolism. A better characterization of WD is essential in understanding the effects of excess copper and how it disrupts immune regulation and hematopoietic development. Furthermore, the exploration of the relationship between copper-mediated proliferation or cuproptosis and immune regulation is critical for developing new immune therapies. Therefore, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to develop an atlas of the immune landscape. Cells were clustered into several immune subsets, and cuproptosis-associated genes were assessed. Differential expression analysis was performed to identify WD-specific signatures by comparing transcriptome profiles of patients with WD with HDs. Excess copper impaired immune homeostasis and hematopoietic development. Then, we developed a map of the immune landscape of patients with WD. Excess copper is involved in the metabolic reprogramming of immune cells, such as glycolysis in CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes. We found that the antigen processing-related pathway is dysregulated in immune cells of patients with WD. Our study revealed that abnormal copper concentration influences the expression of HLA-I and HLA-II molecules. It is noteworthy that a high concentration of intracellular copper differs significantly from the high concentration of extracellular copper. We have also identified a gene set of neurologic abnormalities, which were dysregulated in PBMCs of patients with WD. We also observed abnormal expression of cuproptosis-associated genes in proliferating or malignant cells, providing new insights into the application of cuproptosis in cancer treatment."

    "title": "Molnupiravir or nirmatrelvir-ritonavir plus usual care versus usual care alone in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 (RECOVERY): a randomised, controlled, open-label, platform trial.",
    "abstract": "Molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir-ritonavir are oral antivirals that have shown efficacy in preventing disease progression in outpatients with COVID-19. We aimed to evaluate these treatments for patients hospitalised with COVID-19 pneumonia, for whom data on these antivirals are scarce. The RECOVERY trial is a randomised, controlled, open-label, adaptive platform trial testing treatments for COVID-19. In this study we report the molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir-ritonavir comparisons from the RECOVERY trial. In each comparison, participants aged 18 years and older were randomly allocated (1:1) to the relevant antiviral (5 days of molnupiravir 800 mg twice daily or 300 mg nirmatrelvir and 100 mg ritonavir twice daily) in addition to usual care, or to usual care alone. The molnupiravir comparison was conducted at 75 hospitals in the UK, two in Nepal, and two in Indonesia; the nirmatrelvir-ritonavir comparison was conducted at 32 hospitals in the UK. Participants could take part in both comparisons. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, and secondary outcomes were time to discharge alive from hospital and progression to invasive ventilation or death. Analysis was by intention to treat. Both comparisons were stopped because of low recruitment. This study is registered with ISRCTN, 50189673, and ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04381936. From Jan 24, 2022, to May 24, 2023, 923 participants were recruited to the molnupiravir comparison (445 allocated to molnupiravir and 478 to usual care), and from March 31, 2022, to May 24, 2023, 137 participants were recruited to the nirmatrelvir-ritonavir comparison (68 allocated to nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and 69 to usual care). More than three-quarters of participants were vaccinated and had antispike antibodies at randomisation, and more than two-thirds were receiving other SARS-CoV-2 antivirals. In the molnupiravir comparison, 74 (17%) participants allocated to molnupiravir and 79 (17%) allocated to usual care died within 28 days (hazard ratio [HR] 0Â·93 [95% CI 0Â·68-1Â·28], p=0Â·66). In the nirmatrelvir-ritonavir comparison, 13 (19%) participants allocated to nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and 13 (19%) allocated to usual care died within 28 days (HR 1Â·02 [0Â·47-2Â·23], p=0Â·96). In neither comparison was there evidence of any difference in the duration of hospitalisation or the proportion of participants progressing to invasive ventilation or death. Adding molnupiravir or nirmatrelvir-ritonavir to usual care was not associated with improvements in clinical outcomes. However, low recruitment meant a clinically meaningful benefit of treatment could not be ruled out, particularly for nirmatrelvir-ritonavir.

    "abstract": "Individuals at risk for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) but without spirometric airflow obstruction can have respiratory symptoms and structural lung disease on chest computed tomography. Current guidelines recommend COPD diagnostic schemas that do not incorporate imaging abnormalities. To determine whether a multidimensional COPD diagnostic schema that includes respiratory symptoms and computed tomographic imaging abnormalities identifies additional individuals with disease. This cohort study included 2 longitudinal cohorts: the Genetic Epidemiology of COPD (COPDGene), which enrolled 10 305 participants between November 9, 2007, and April 15, 2011, with longitudinal follow-up through August 31, 2022; and the Canadian Cohort Obstructive Lung Disease (CanCOLD), which enrolled 1561 participants between November 26, 2009, and July 15, 2015, with follow-up through December 31, 2023. Exposure included the new multidimensional COPD diagnostic schema, defined by (1) major diagnostic category: presence of the major criterion (airflow obstruction based on postbronchodilator forced expiratory volume in the first second of expiration [FEV1]/forced vital capacity ratio <0.70) and at least 1 of 5 minor criteria (emphysema or bronchial wall thickening on computed tomography, dyspnea, poor respiratory quality of life, and chronic bronchitis); or (2) minor diagnostic category: presence of least 3 of 5 minor criteria (which must include emphysema and bronchial wall thickening for individuals with respiratory symptoms potentially due to other causes). All-cause mortality, respiratory cause-specific mortality, exacerbations, and annualized change in FEV1. Among 9416 adults in COPDGene (mean [SD] age at enrollment, 59.6 [9.0] years; 5035 [53.5%] were men; 3071 [32.6%] were Black; 6345 (67.4%) were White; 4943 [52.5%] currently smoked), 811 of 5250 individuals (15.4%) without airflow obstruction were newly classified as having COPD by minor diagnostic category, and 282 of 4166 individuals (6.8%) with airflow obstruction were classified as not having COPD. Reclassified individuals with a new COPD diagnosis had greater all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.98; 95% CI, 1.67-2.35; P < .001) and respiratory-specific mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 3.58; 95% CI, 1.56-8.20; P = .003), more exacerbations (adjusted incidence rate ratio, 2.09; 95% CI, 1.79-2.44; P < .001), and more rapid FEV1 decline (adjusted Î² = -7.7 mL/y; 95% CI, -13.2 to -2.3; P = .006) compared with individuals classified as not having COPD. Among individuals with airflow obstruction on spirometry, those no longer classified as having COPD based on this new diagnostic schema had outcomes similar to those without airflow obstruction. Among 1341 adults in CanCOLD, individuals newly classified as having COPD experienced more exacerbations (adjusted incidence rate ratio, 2.09; 95% CI, 1.25-3.51; P < .001). A new COPD diagnostic schema integrating respiratory symptoms, respiratory quality of life, spirometry, and structural lung abnormalities on computed tomographic imaging newly classified some individuals as having COPD. These individuals had an increased risk of all-cause and respiratory-related death, frequent exacerbations, and rapid lung function decline compared with individuals classified as not having COPD. Some individuals with airflow obstruction without respiratory symptoms or evidence of structural lung disease were no longer classified as having COPD."

    "abstract": "Helicobacter pylori is a pathogen of the human stomach that infects half of the world's population. The chronicity of the infection is a major risk factor for the development of gastric cancer. Multiple parameters, including the heterogenicity of the virulence factors, the environmental parameters, or the intensity of the host responses, regulate the evolution of the disease. Thus, we have reported that the dysregulation of the polyamine pathway in the infected gastric mucosa represents a major component of the inflammation and the risk for neoplastic transformation. Using different animal models and gastric organoids, we recently highlighted the critical role of spermine oxidase-derived acrolein in the pathogenesis of H. pylori infection and the progression to carcinoma. Herein, we describe the experimental procedures that have been used, from the culture of the bacteria to the various models of infection in vivo and in vitro, and the assessment of acrolein generation."

    "abstract": "Social prescribing links people to activities and services typically provided by local voluntary and community sectors to address social determinants of health and wellbeing. People living with long-term health conditions are a target population. This relatively new approach is rapidly expanding, and there is varied evidence regarding how social prescribing is being delivered for people living with long-term conditions. This scoping review aims to report on what is known about the approach for these patient populations. Electronic databases MEDLINE, CINAHL, Scopus, Web of Science, and PsycINFO were searched in December 2023, and relevant sources of gray literature in January 2024, with both updated in February 2025. Studies eligible for inclusion included adults (18 +) with long-term conditions engaging with social prescribing in health and community contexts. Studies published in English in any year were included. A data charting template captured key characteristics including reasons for referral, referral pathways, activities and services being utilized, and outcome measures. A descriptive narrative synthesis was conducted, guided by the review questions to explore the current evidence. Thirty-seven sources of evidence were included. Diabetes was the most common of 65 conditions identified (n = 23). The presence of a long-term condition was the most frequent reason for referral (n = 30), followed by mental health concerns (n = 15), and social isolation or loneliness (n = 11). Most referrals were made within primary care (n = 33), to a link worker or social prescriber (n = 29), who supported participants to access activities and services including exercise (n = 22), information, support, and advice (n = 19), mental health support (n = 15), social and leisure activities (n = 15) and condition-specific support (n = 14). Wellbeing was the most commonly identified measured outcome (n = 23), with studies utilizing the Warwick Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scales (n = 7) and Wellbeing Star (n = 7) most frequently. While common factors were identified, there is considerable variation in social prescribing approaches for people living with long-term conditions, reflecting the diversity of needs, availability of community services, and necessity for personalized care. Further research is needed to inform the development of evidence-based practice which addresses the complex needs of diverse patient populations and supports access to a broad range of referral pathways."

    "title": "Myeloid EGFR deficiency accelerates recovery from AKI via macrophage efferocytosis and neutrophil apoptosis.",
    "abstract": "Altered expression and activation of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) is implicated in acute and chronic kidney injury. One of the important cellular sources of EGFR is the myeloid compartment, which plays roles in both acute kidney injury and subsequent fibrosis. Here we show in a murine ischemic acute kidney injury (AKI) model that myeloid deletion of EGFR promotes a pro-resolving, anti-inflammatory phenotype and increased efferocytotic capacity in macrophages. This leads to accelerated recovery in response to AKI and inhibited subsequent development of tubulointerstitial fibrosis. We find that selective EGFR deletion in neutrophils also accelerates recovery from ischemic kidney injury and reduces subsequent fibrosis. EGFR activation plays an essential role in increasing the life span of neutrophils in the injured kidney. Deletion of EGFR expression either in all murine myeloid cells or selectively in neutrophils decreases kidney neutrophil Mcl-1 expression and promotes neutrophil apoptosis, which is accompanied by accelerated recovery from organ injury and reduced subsequent fibrosis. These studies thus identify coordinated and complementary roles for EGFR activation in neutrophils and macrophages to exacerbate kidney injury."

    "abstract": "Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading cause of lower respiratory tract infection and hospitalisations in infants worldwide. The primary analyses of HARMONIE showed that nirsevimab reduced infant hospitalisations due to RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection through the RSV season. This analysis aims to evaluate nirsevimab's efficacy at 180 days after dosing, a period exceeding the typical 5-month RSV season. HARMONIE is an ongoing, open-label, parallel arm, randomised, controlled, phase 3b study conducted in France, Germany, and the UK. Infants aged 12 months or younger, born at a gestational age of at least 29 weeks, were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either a single intramuscular dose of nirsevimab (50 mg for children <5 kg or 100 mg for children â¥5 kg) or standard care (without RSV prophylaxis) before or during their first RSV season. Randomisation was electronically done, stratified by country and age-group. The primary efficacy endpoint for this analysis was the incidence of hospitalisations due to RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection up to 180 days after nirsevimab administration or randomisation in all randomised participants. Safety up to 365 days following nirsevimab administration was also assessed. This trial is ongoing and registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT05437510. Between Aug 8, 2022, and Feb 28, 2023, 8057 infants were randomly assigned to either the nirsevimab group (n=4038) or the standard care group (n=4019). The median age at randomisation was 4Â·00 months (IQR 1Â·0-7Â·0; range 0Â·0-12Â·0, and 4195 (52Â·1%) were male and 3862 (47Â·9%) were female. Up to 180 days, 12 (0Â·3%) of 4038 infants in the nirsevimab group and 68 (1Â·7%) of 4019 infants in the standard care group had been hospitalised for RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection, corresponding to a nirsevimab efficacy of 82Â·7% (95% CI 67Â·8-91Â·5; p<0Â·0001). Most participants experienced grade 1 (2759 [68Â·7%] of 4016 in the nirsevimab group; 2696 [67Â·1%] of 4018 in the standard care group) or grade 2 (1447 [36Â·0%] of 4016 in the nirsevimab group; 1436 [35Â·7%] of 4018 in the standard care group) treatment-emergent adverse events, and no apparent safety concerns were raised up to 365 days after dosing. Nirsevimab offers consistent and sustained protection against hospitalisation due to RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection for at least 6 months. This finding provides global health systems greater flexibility when implementing nirsevimab, providing substantial benefit in the ongoing effort to reduce the burden of infant RSV and the potential wider public health value.

    "abstract": "Most of the 2.3 million annual neonatal deaths occur in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, with perinatal asphyxia and neonatal sepsis being the leading causes of neonatal mortality. Most neonatal deaths are considered preventable through high-quality clinical care, which includes adherence to clinical care guidelines. To assess adherence to World Health Organization clinical care guidelines for management of perinatal asphyxia and neonatal sepsis and to identify patient-level factors in adherence among neonates who died from these conditions. This cross-sectional study obtained data from December 2015 through October 2023 from the Child Health and Mortality Prevention Surveillance (CHAMPS) catchment areas in 7 low- and middle-income countries in sub-Saharan Africa (Ethiopia, Kenya, Mali, Mozambique, Sierra Leone, and South Africa) and South Asia (Bangladesh). Participants were neonates who were born alive and were aged 0 to 28 days at the time of death and had either perinatal asphyxia or neonatal sepsis. Medical records of neonates who died from perinatal asphyxia or neonatal sepsis determined by postmortem diagnostics. The main outcome was the proportion of deceased neonates who received guideline-adherent treatments before they died. Mixed-effect multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with administration of at least bag-valve-mask (BVM) ventilation for perinatal asphyxia. Of the 1194 neonates (median [IQR] age at the time of death, 2 [1-6] days; 692 males [58.0%]) who died and were enrolled in CHAMPS with available clinical data, 476 (39.9%) died from perinatal asphyxia, 562 (47.0%) died from neonatal sepsis, and 156 (13.1%) from both conditions. These neonates had a median (IQR) birth weight of 2130 (1266-2988) g. For cases with perinatal asphyxia, guideline adherence ranged from 12.2% (n = 77) for adrenaline administration to 85.4% (540) for supplemental oxygen administration. Only 4.4% of neonates (28) with perinatal asphyxia received all recommended treatments. Among cases with neonatal sepsis, antibiotics were administered to 86.8% (623), although the recommended treatment was administered to only 61.0% (438). In multivariable analyses, neonates in whom clinicians accurately identified perinatal asphyxia were more likely to receive BVM ventilation than those who had received discordant antemortem and postmortem diagnoses (adjusted odds ratio, 2.00; 95% CI, 1.29-3.12). In this cross-sectional study, clinical care guideline adherence was suboptimal among neonates who died from perinatal asphyxia or neonatal sepsis. This finding underscores the critical need to increase adherence in regions with high rates of neonatal mortality and may inform strategies for strengthening health systems to support compliance with clinical care guidelines."

Crossover-design. Nineteen people with Parkinson's and freezing (females: 10; age:75.5 Â± 7.5 years) tested while ON medication. Participants navigated a cluttered virtual domestic environment with freeze-provoking tasks. Assessments occurred in the laboratory at baseline, post-anticipatory postural adjustments training, and post-attentional-control training, with randomized training order. All training was video-based. Video annotation was used to identify freezing events. Participants' immediately recollected thoughts they had during the tasks were analysed with content analysis. Perceived safety and effectiveness of the strategies were reported in follow-up calls held 4 weeks post-assessment. Successful step initiations increased from 57% at baseline to 77% post-anticipatory postural adjustments training (p = 0.034). Participants rated the interventions as safe and effective, reporting increased balance confidence (70% to 90%), and reduced fear (p = 0.01), after the anticipatory postural training. Attentional-control training alone was perceived as less effective compared with more goal-directed anticipatory postural adjustments training. Video-based anticipatory postural adjustments training significantly improved step initiation from freezing when used during challenging tasks and in complex environments. Anticipatory postural adjustments training shows promise as an effective \"rescue strategy\" that could be learned remotely/at home."

The miRNA-29b-3p level decreased in liver fibrosis, while the mechanism of miRNA-29b-3p in liver fibrosis has not been reported, and was elucidated in the work. The miRNA-29b-3p levels were evaluated by q-PCR. The effect of miRNA- 29b-3p on the activity of hepatic stellate cells was detected by cell activity assay. The protein levels were checked by western blot. The interaction between miRNA-29b-3p and ULK1 mRNA with base complementary sequences was detected by double luciferase assay. The autophagosomes were observed by TEM. The cell fibrosis-like change was evaluated with an anti-Î±-smooth muscle actin (Î±-SMA) antibody by IF. The results showed that miRNA-29b-3p mimics down-regulated the Î±-SMA and Col1 protein levels, and miRNA-29b-3p inhibitors upregulated the Î±-SMA and Col1 protein levels. The dual-luciferase assay result revealed that miRNA-29b-3p interacted with ULK1. The miRNA-29b-3p mimics inhibited the protein expression of ULK1, beclin1, and LC3, whereas miRNA-29b-3p inhibitors promoted the protein expression of ULK1, beclin1, and LC3. The miRNA-29b-3p blocked HSCs trans-differentiation into myofibroblasts by inhibiting autophagy, and further inhibiting liver fibrosis in WD."

In vivo, biomimetic collective behavior allows precise navigation and reduction of the intrahepatic ammonia level, reshaping the pathological microenvironment. This mechanism, operating in a green, zero-waste manner, facilitates integration of these micromotors into the domain of biological regulation. Such environment environment-adaptive platform is favorable for targeted treatment of hepatic fibrosis and hepatic encephalopathy caused by hyperammonemia, which is expected to provide inspiration for future personalized and precision medicine."

A phase 4, randomized, active-controlled, noninferiority trial on influenza vaccine immunogenicity conducted over 2 influenza seasons (2018-2019 and 2019-2020) (NCT03694808). Residents of LTCFs aged â¥65 years. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive either aTIV or HD-IIV3 using computer-generated randomization. Only laboratory personnel were blinded. Hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) and neuraminidase inhibition (NI) assays measured antibody responses at baseline and 28 days postvaccination. The primary outcome compared the geometric mean titers (GMTs) at day 28. Secondary outcomes included seroconversion rates and NI titers. We randomized 387 LTCF residents to receive either aTIV (n = 194) or HD-IIV3 (n = 193) over 2 flu seasons. We observed noninferior HAI levels at postvaccination day 28 to A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 for aTIV and HD-IIV3 (GMT ratio, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.76-1.4; and GMT ratio, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.73-1.48, respectively), meeting noninferiority criteria with 95% CI upper bounds <1.5. However, noninferiority criteria were not met for influenza B HAI levels (GMT ratio, 1.21; 95% CI, 0.91-1.61). Also, noninferiority criteria for HAI seroconversion were not met for any of the 3 strains. Applying the same noninferiority criteria to NI, both day 28 titer and seroconversion in aTIV were noninferior to HD-IIV3 for A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 strains. Overall the anti-hemagglutinin and anti-neuraminidase titers demonstrate similarities between the vaccines and support them both being in the enhanced flu vaccine category preferentially recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for people aged â¥65 years."

These bnAb precursors, that target the CD4 receptor binding site, had undergone somatic hypermutation characteristic of the VRC01-class. A subset of isolated VRC01-class monoclonal antibodies neutralized wild-type pseudoviruses and was structurally extremely similar to bnAb VRC01. These results further support germline-targeting approaches for human HIV vaccine design and demonstrate atomic-level manipulation of B cell responses with rational vaccine design."

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) affects millions of individuals worldwide, and is characterized by both acute, episodic pain and chronic, persistent pain. Despite the significant burden of the disease, clinicians continue to face significant challenges in treating SCD pain due to variability in pain experiences. The objectives of this study were (1) to identify distinct pain subgroups based on demographic and biopsychosocial characteristics and (2) to evaluate the relationship between the subgroups and pain impact - a SCD-disease specific measure of pain interference. To achieve these objectives, we performed a hierarchical cluster analysis on a cross-sectional sample of adults with SCD who are enrolled in the Globin Research Network Data and Discovery (GRNDaD) registry. Five hundred thirty-two participants (61% females and 64% with chronic pain) were included in the analysis. Six distinct subgroups were identified, 3 with chronic pain (Clusters 1-3) and 3 without chronic pain (Clusters 4-6). Despite differences in biological markers of disease severity such as genotype, hemoglobin and fetal hemoglobin percentage, chronic pain subgroups had comparable odds of reporting worse pain impact, suggesting that chronic pain has a disproportionate influence on SCD pain when compared to other factors. Longitudinal studies are needed to further validate these findings and to determine how these pain subgroups may change. Overall, our findings indicate that understanding and preventing chronic pain in SCD must be a top priority to improve the quality of life of those living with SCD."

    "abstract": "<i>Phyllachora maydis</i>, the causal agent of tar spot of corn, is an emerging disease in the United States and Canada. This study aims to improve our understanding of <i>P. maydis</i> spore release and dispersal by utilizing spore trapping and quantitative PCR to assess the relationship between spore capture and environmental conditions. Burkard and rotating-arm air samplers were deployed in Michigan corn fields with natural disease pressure from 2021 to 2023. Correlation analysis and mixed-effects logistic regression were applied to examine the impact of environmental factors on spore capture. Through an exhaustive screening of candidate logistic regression models, results indicated that spore quantity is significantly negatively correlated with daily summaries of minimum temperature (<i>P</i><0.05, Ï=-0.24), mean temperature (<i>P</i><0.05, Ï=-0.25), maximum precipitation rate (<i>P</i><0.05, Ï=-0.33) and durations of temperature between 16.6 to 23ÂºC and relative humidity over 85% (<i>P</i><0.001, Ï=-0.27). Logistic regression models frequently incorporated temperature and humidity predictors, and the best performing model used daily averages of mean temperature and maximum humidity to discriminate presence and absence of spore detection, achieving a balanced accuracy of 85%. Across all site-years, spore traps did not detect <i>P. maydis</i> spores prior to the visible detection of tar spot symptoms but did detect spores before tar spot incidence reached 100%. Through this study, the environmental drivers of spore release and dispersal were described to fill current knowledge gaps in the tar spot disease cycle. Additionally, a methodology for the capture and molecular quantification of airborne <i>P. maydis</i> spores is described which will benefit future research."

    "title": "Changes in Protein Expression of Renal Drug Transporters and Drug-Metabolizing Enzymes in Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease Patients.",
    "abstract": "Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease is the most prevalent inherited kidney disease and leads to bilateral kidney enlargement and progressive loss of renal function, often over decades. Comorbidities include hypertension, flank pain, and bacterial infections. The condition often necessitates prolonged multidrug therapy. Given the kidneys' critical role in drug excretion, the progressive functional impairment in the disease can lead to complications such as drug overdosing and unexpected levels of drug-drug interactions. Studies of drug-metabolizing enzyme and transporter expression in this patient group remain scarce. We conducted comprehensive global liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry proteomic analyses of microsomal and cytosolic fractions from early-stage (chronic kidney disease stage: 13, n = 16) and end-stage autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease patients (chronic kidney disease stage: 5, n = 14), comparing them with age-matched healthy controls (n = 11). In the early-stage ADPKD samples, most drug-metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters did not differ significantly from the healthy controls. Exceptions were EPHX2 and SULT1C2 in the cytosolic fraction, which showed a more than 2-fold decrease in abundance (P < 0.05). In contrast, the end-stage ADPKD kidney samples showed a decrease in the abundance of most measured proteins. Several drug-metabolizing enzymes, including CYP4F2, UGT1A6, UGT1A9, and UGT2B7, exhibited statistically significant reductions (P < 0.05). Among the drug transporters, OAT1, OAT3, and OCT2 were below the limit of quantification in most ES-ADPKD samples. MDR1 was the only efflux drug transporter consistently measured, with an average abundance of 1.24 pmol/mg microsomal protein across all samples."

    "abstract": "Coronary CT angiography (cCTA) is a non-invasive diagnostic test for coronary artery disease (CAD) that often faces challenges with dense calcifications and stents due to blooming artifacts, leading to stenosis overestimation. Virtual monoenergetic images (VMIs) from photon counting detector CT (PCD-CT) provide distinct clinical benefits. Lower keV VMIs enhance iodine and bone contrasts but struggle with blooming artifacts, while higher keV VMIs effectively reduce beam hardening, blooming, and metal artifacts but diminish contrast, presenting a trade-off among different keV levels. To address this, we introduce a contrast-guided virtual monoenergetic image synthesis framework (CITRINE) utilizing adversarial learning to synthesize images by integrating beneficial spectral characteristics from various keV levels. In this study, CITRINE is trained and validated with cardiac PCD-CT images using 100 keV and 70 keV VMIs as examples, showcasing its ability to synthesize images that combine the reduced blooming artifacts of 100 keV VMIs with the high contrast-to-noise features of 70 keV VMIs. CITRINE's performance was evaluated on three patient cCTA cases quantitatively and qualitatively in terms of image quality and assessments of percent diameter luminal stenosis. The synthesized images showed reduced blooming artifacts, similar to those observed at 100 keV VMI, and exhibited high iodine contrast in the coronary lumen, comparable to that of 70 keV VMI. Notably, compared to the original 70 keV VMI, CITRINE images achieved approximately 25% reduction in percent diameter stenosis while maintaining consistent contrast levels. These results confirm CITRINE's effectiveness in improving diagnostic accuracy and efficiency in cCTA by leveraging the full potential of multi-energy and PCD-CT technologies."

    "abstract": "Ultra-high-resolution (UHR) photon-counting detector (PCD) CT offers superior spatial resolution compared to conventional CT, benefiting various clinical areas. However, the UHR resolution also significantly increases image noise, which can limit its clinical adoption in areas such as cardiac CT. In clinical practice, this image noise varies substantially across imaging conditions, such as different diagnostic tasks, patient characteristics (e.g., size), scan protocols, and image reconstruction settings. To address these challenges and provide the full potential of PCD-CT for optimal clinical performance, a convolutional neural network (CNN) denoising algorithm was developed, optimized, and tailored to each specific set of conditions. The algorithm's effectiveness in reducing noise and its impact on coronary artery stenosis quantification across different patient size categories (small: water equivalent diameter <300 mm, medium: 300-320 mm, and large: >320 mm) were objectively assessed. Reconstruction kernels at different sharpness, from Bv60 to Bv76, were investigated to determine optimal settings for each patient size regarding image quality and quantitative assessment of coronary stenosis (in terms of percent diameter stenosis). Our findings indicate that for patients with a water equivalent diameter less than 320 mm, CNN-denoised Bv72 images provide optimal image quality, less blooming artifact, and reduced percent diameter stenosis compared to routine images, while for patients with water equivalent diameter over 320 mm, CNN-denoised Bv60 images are preferable. Quantitatively, the CNN reduces noise-by 85% compared to the input images and 53% compared to commercial iterative reconstructions at strength 4 (QIR4)-while maintaining high spatial resolution and a natural noise texture. Moreover, it enhances stenosis quantification by reducing the percent diameter stenosis measurement by 52% relative to the input and 24% relative to QIR4. These improvements demonstrate the capability of CNN denoising in UHR PCD-CT to enhance image quality and quantitative assessment of coronary artery disease in a manner that is adaptive to patient characteristics and imaging conditions."

    "abstract": "von Willebrand disease (VWD) is a common inherited bleeding disorder caused by low levels or activity of circulating von Willebrand factor (VWF). Genetic susceptibility to VWF antigen (VWF:Ag) below normal (â¤ 50 IU/dL) in the general population is underexplored. To identify genetic variants influencing VWF:Ag levels â¤ 50 IU/dL. We performed a genome-wide association study in 926 cases with VWF:Ag levels â¤ 50 IU/dL and 12 846 controls from 7 studies from the Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine program. We then examined whether significant genome-wide findings were also associated with clinical diagnosis of VWD in 5 biobanks with 708 VWD cases and 1 286 069 controls, and with 6 bleeding and thrombotic disorders in FinnGen. Variants at 2 loci were associated (P < 5 Ã 10<sup>-9</sup>) with VWF:Ag levels â¤ 50 IU/dL: ABO and VWF. The VWF index variant, p.Tyr1584Cys, is a rare (0.22%) missense variant with odds ratio (OR) of 78.58, while the ABO index variant is a common intronic variant with a smaller effect (OR = 2.52). Notably, both VWF (OR = 7.16) and ABO (OR = 1.57) variants were also associated (P < .025) with diagnosed VWD. Among p.Tyr1584Cys heterozygotes, the penetrance of VWF:Ag levels â¤ 50 IU/dL was 24.2% and the penetrance of diagnosed VWD was 0.3%. p.Tyr1584Cys was associated (P < .0042) with increased odds of heavy menstrual bleeding (OR = 1.27), iron deficiency anemia (OR = 1.55), and intrapartum hemorrhage (OR = 2.20), but decreased odds of deep vein thrombosis (OR = 0.54). Although there are currently conflicting interpretations of pathogenicity p.Tyr1584Cys, our results suggest that it is a low penetrance pathogenic variant that contributes to VWF:Ag levels â¤ 50 IU/dL, bleeding, and VWD."

    "abstract": "Chronic bowel symptoms are common late-effects of pelvic radiotherapy associated with significantly decreased quality-of-life. For some, perhaps many, people these symptoms may be mitigated or treated, if appropriately investigated and diagnosed. We explored experiences of health service access and provision of support for people with chronic bowel symptoms after pelvic radiotherapy, from the perspectives of cancer survivors and health professionals. Our aim was to highlight processes and contextual factors that may hinder access to effective support and treatment. We carried out semi-structured interviews with 28 cancer survivors (14 female) with experience of post-radiotherapy, chronic bowel symptoms, and 19 health professionals involved in the care of such patients. Recruitment was through three NHS hospitals, cancer charities and professional networks. Data were analysed thematically, deductively (guided by the Model of Pathways to Treatment (MPT)) and inductively. We organised data around three overarching themes positioning experiences within MPT's event sequence or describing health system factor. Gratitude for treatment of cancer, embarrassment and acceptance of symptoms led survivors not to seek further care. Health professionals not recognising symptoms or focusing only on discounting cancer recurrence were barriers to effective care for those who sought it. System barriers included professional specialities working in isolation and geographical disparity in availability of late-effects services. Our findings suggest a need for raising awareness of late-effects of pelvic-radiotherapy among patients and health professionals encompassing recognition of symptoms and awareness of treatments and support and for accelerating access to specialist late-effects services nationally."

    "abstract": "Wilson disease (WD), a rare autosomal-recessive disorder caused by impaired copper metabolism, leads to hepatic dysfunction and copper overaccumulation, debilitating neurological symptoms. Current treatments, primarily metal chelating agents and antioxidants, have limitations like sub-optimal efficacy, limited blood-brain barrier transport, and systemic side effects. This study aims to deliver monoisoamyl 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (MiADMSA), a novel next-generation chelator encapsulated in a liposomal nanocarrier coated with apolipoprotein E (ApoE) to enhance brain targeting and copper chelation. ApoE-coated liposomal formulation is optimized using the Box-Behnken design (BBD). This was followed by comprehensive characterization like dynamic light scattering, scanning electron microscopy, drug-excipient compatibility studies, and in vitro drug release kinetics. Additionally, the developed formulation was investigated on the human neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y) demonstrating safety, biocompatibility, and cell internalization efficacy within 24 h. Bioimaging studies further demonstrated significant brain permeability of the ApoE-coated MiADMSA liposomes, comparable to uncoated MiADMSA liposomes, followed by pharmacodynamic evaluations. Morphometric analysis, behavioral studies, biochemical estimations, and histopathological assessments confirmed the efficacy of ApoE-coated MiADMSA liposomes. The optimized formulation demonstrated sustained release, excellent encapsulation efficiency of up to 90.29%, and a nanosized spherical shape (141.3 Â± 1.26 nm). Effective internalization, biocompatibility, and neuroprotection were validated by cellular investigations. ApoE-MiADMSA-LPS showed notable BBB penetration in in vivo imaging. Biochemical examination indicated less oxidative stress (lower MDA, higher SOD, CAT, and GSH levels), while behavioral investigations demonstrated enhanced cognitive and motor abilities. The optimized liposomal formulation demonstrated enhanced brain targeting, cellular uptake, and neuroprotection, making it a promising therapeutic approach for Wilson disease."

    "title": "Acute Liver Failure due to Wilson's Disease and Rescue Therapy with Plasma Exchange: A Case Report and Literature Review.",
    "abstract": "Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare genetic condition characterized by impaired copper metabolism and can rarely present as acute liver failure with an associated high mortality rate. Treatment often requires liver transplantation, and few rescue treatments have been shown to be effective by randomized trials. This is a case report and scoping literature review on plasmapheresis in acute liver failure due to WD. We report a case of a previously undiagnosed 32-year-old female who presented with acute liver failure due to WD. Initial severity indices (MELD = 31 and RWPI - Revised Wilson Prognostic Index = 14) warranted liver transplant referral; however, no facilities were available. The patient was managed by two sessions of plasmapheresis with plasma exchange with persistent improvement in MELD score over 1 week. Subsequent ongoing chelation therapy resulted in a total reversal of clinical liver disease over 2 years. Literature review resulted in 74 patients reported to have been treated with plasmapheresis for WD and acute liver failure. Of these, 40% survived without transplant. Out of the total patients reported, 54 patients had an available NWI score, with 46 patients having a high-risk score of â¥11 (85%) and 8 patients had a score <11 (15%). Of the 46 patients with a score â¥11, 21 (46%) recovered without liver transplantation, 16 (35%) underwent liver transplantation, 8 (17%) died of liver failure, and 1 (â¼2%) died of sepsis. Of the 8 patients with a score of <11, 4 (50%) recovered without a liver transplantation, and 4 (50%) underwent transplantation. The outcomes observed in the literature and the favorable outcome of our patient suggest an emphasis on the use of urgent plasmapheresis with plasma exchange as an initial intervention for acute liver failure in WD, although further randomized controlled trials are needed for determining the optimal dose and duration of treatment."

Remote monitoring of VL could support efforts to rapidly respond to sub-optimal adherence. This qualitative study enrolled 24 SMM with HIV who use stimulants to examine experiences with two different dried blood spots (DBS) self-sampling devices (i.e., Tasso-M20 vs. HemaSpot HD) to measure VL. Participants were asked to complete self-sampling of DBS using both devices, and then participated in a 45-minute semi-structured interview. Interviews focused on ease of use, device preference, experiences with receiving and mailing kits, and barriers to participating in research. A thematic analysis was conducted to analyze interview transcripts. Twenty-two participants (92%) returned the Tasso-M20 and 21 (88%) returned the Hemaspot HD devices. Among the 22 participants that completed qualitative interviews, twenty-three codes were identified and collapsed within seven themes. Preferences for devices were based on convenience, pain and prior experiences with finger-pricking technology. Participants emphasized that clearer instructions with contingency plans for self-sampling of DBS would improve the user experience with self-sampling of DBS. Intersectional stigma (e.g., HIV, sexual minority status, and substance use) was noted as an important consideration in implementing self-sampling of DBS. Promoting decision making, or the option to choose sampling method based on personal preferences, may improve engagement and likelihood of DBS completion. Findings will guide the broader implementation of self-sampling of DBS to optimize VL monitoring in SMM with HIV who use stimulants. Routine HIV viral load (VL) testing is recommended to assess the success of anti-retroviral therapy (ART) and identify individuals who may be experiencing difficulties with adherence to optimize rates of viral suppression [1]. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Panel on Antiretroviral Guidelines for Adults and Adolescents recommends routine VL monitoring every three to six months after initiating ART. For those with optimal ART adherence and consistently suppressed VL for more than one year, VL monitoring is recommended every six months [2]. A convenience sample of SMM with HIV who use stimulants were recruited via email using an existing consent-to-contact database of individuals interested in potential research participation. Recruitment included up to three emails, sent between March and June 2022, which detailed the study purpose and provided a link to the online study screener. Interested individuals who clicked on the provided link were directed to a brief screener consent page before reaching the screener survey.

    "abstract": "Mobile spine chordomas demonstrate varied surgical risk profiles compared to their sacral analogs. Often, the limitation to performing an <i>en bloc</i> resection of a mobile spine chordoma is tumor violation of the epidural space. Given these limitations, we propose the utilization of carbon fiber-reinforced polyetheretherketone (CFR-PEEK) instrumentation in separation surgery to enhance visualization for stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) planning, allowing an ablative radiosurgical dose to be delivered. We present two illustrative cases highlighting the advantages of hybrid therapy (separation surgery and adjuvant SBRT) with CFR-PEEK instrumentation in the management of mobile spine chordoma. Case 1 is a 62-year-old female with an L4 chordoma who underwent separation surgery and L3-5 posterior instrumented fusion using CFR-PEEK instrumentation. Case 2 is a 68-year-old female with a L3 chordoma who underwent revision separation surgery encompassing completion of L3 partial corpectomy and CFR-PEEK screw exchange of prior L2-4 titanium instrumentation. Both patients received postoperative ablative SBRT. At 18-month postoperative time points, both patients were clinically stable, with no signs of tumor recurrence or progression. Mobile spine chordomas present a unique challenge in obtaining a margin negative <i>en bloc</i> resection. Separation surgery allows the ability to decrease surgical morbidity and deliver an ablative radiosurgical dose. Furthermore, the incorporation of CFR-PEEK instrumentation allows the utilization of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging for long-term disease monitoring. Hybrid therapy, a less morbid alternative to standard <i>en bloc</i> spondylectomy, offers a better surgical morbidity profile by combining effectively with SBRT for optimal tumor control."

    "abstract": "Wilson's disease (WD) is a disorder of copper metabolism due to variants in the <i>ATP7B</i> gene. This autosomal recessively inherited disorder is characterized by the accumulation of copper in various body parts, mainly the liver, brain, and kidneys. Initially, WD was described to involve the hepatic and neurological systems. Subsequently, diverse presentations have been reported with skeletal and hematological manifestations and various constellations of symptoms. Neurological manifestations of WD are varied, ranging from asymptomatic neurological state to refractory dystonia. Earlier, the diagnosis was based only on measuring serum ceruloplasmin levels, urinary copper levels, and imaging. Advanced genetic testing has provided an additional mode of diagnosis in the patient, screening of the family members and, a way to better understand the genotype-phenotype associations of the disease if there are any. In the last few decades, the treatment of WD has evolved from symptomatic treatment and chelation therapy to many new advanced measures for both copper chelation and symptomatic relief. With a better understanding of the genetic aspects of WD in recent years, there has been more focus on gene therapy, novel therapies targeting ATP7B genes, and therapies targeting mutant proteins to prevent copper accumulation. This article highlights the advances in diagnostic methods and treatment modalities in WD."

    "abstract": "The most common cause of arterial ischemic stroke in healthy children, focal cerebral arteriopathy (FCA), can progress rapidly over days with worsening brain injury. A 2017 retrospective Swiss study of corticosteroid treatment for FCA changed practice. To assess its impact, we compared the FCA cohorts from the 2 VIPS (Vascular Effects of Infection in Pediatric Stroke) prospective cohort studies. The VIPS II study prospectively enrolled 205 children (29 days to 18 years) with arterial ischemic stroke at 22 centers, December 2016 to January 2022. The local team measured 12-month outcomes using the pediatric stroke outcome measure. A neuroradiologist and pediatric vascular neurologist independently reviewed all clinically obtained imaging and clinical data to classify the cause of arterial ischemic stroke. The neuroradiologist measured the FCA Severity Score on vascular imaging performed at any time poststroke. We compared the VIPS II FCA cohort to the previously published FCA cohort from VIPS I (2010-2014; 37 centers). Of 75 children with definite arteriopathy enrolled in VIPS II, 32 (43%) had FCA, compared with 41 of 127 (32%) of definite arteriopathy cases in VIPS I. The median age was 11.3 years (56% male) in VIPS I and 11.4 years (55%) in VIPS II. Treatment with intravenous corticosteroids increased from 2 of 41 (5%) of FCA patients in VIPS I to 18 of 32 (56%) in VIPS II. The VIPS II FCA cases were more severe at baseline (median FCA Severity Score 6 versus 4; <i>P</i>=0.006). There were no significant differences in either the change in FCA Severity Score (baseline to maximum) or the 12-month neurological outcomes. Treatment of FCA with corticosteroids increased dramatically between the VIPS I and VIPS II studies. VIPS II cases were more severe at baseline, but we observed no significant difference in disease progression or neurological outcomes. Given the low level of evidence supporting corticosteroid therapy, pediatric stroke centers should enroll FCA patients into ongoing FCA corticosteroid treatment trials.

The relationship between ceruloplasmin and neurodegenerative diseases was revealed by a decrease in the serum ceruloplasmin concentration, which is characteristic of hepatolenticular degeneration with copper overload, in patients with Wilson's disease. Serum ceruloplasmin levels are typically decreased in patients with Wilson's disease, Menkes's disease (copper deficiency), and aceruloplasminemia. The molecular pathogenesis underlying different forms of neurodegeneration has provided new insights into the pathways of brain iron and copper metabolism."

    "abstract": "We report our first 100 episodes of support with a pulsatile paracorporeal VAD (Berlin Heart) and compare characteristics and outcomes of those patients who underwent VAD explantation after native ventricular recovery (n=7 patients) to those patients without ventricular recovery supported as a bridge-to-transplantation (n=92 patients who underwent 93 episodes of VAD support). Comparisons between the two cohorts were made using descriptive statistics: count(n), median, interquartile range[Q1-Q3], and range(minimum-maximum). Of 93 episodes of VAD support without native ventricular recovery, acquired heart disease (myocarditis/cardiomyopathy)=39/93=41.9%, VAD status post cardiac transplantation=2/93=2.2%, congenital heart disease=52/93=55.9%, and functionally univentricular circulation=40/93=43.0%. Of 7 patients who underwent VAD weaning and subsequent VAD explantation after cardiac recovery, acquired heart disease (myocarditis/cardiomyopathy) was present in 6/7=85.7% and congenital heart disease was present in 1/7=14.3%. Biventricular circulation was present in 7/7=100% Renal dysfunction prior to VAD insertion was present in 0/7=0%, and hepatic dysfunction prior to VAD insertion was present in 0/7=0%. In these 7 explanted patients, age at VAD insertion (days)=107[31-236](29-449], weight at VAD insertion (kilograms)=6[3.8-6.3](2.63-7.08), age at VAD removal (days)=261[183-451](167-557), and length of VAD support (days)=138[102-164](76-215). Follow-up (years)=4.4[1.8-6.8](1.5-7.3). Overall survival to date is 7/7=100%. 6/7 patients who underwent VAD removal still have their native hearts, and 1/7 who underwent VAD removal underwent subsequent cardiac transplantation 334 days after VAD removal. Berlin Heart is an effective bridge-to-transplantation; however, a subset of patients supported with Berlin Heart (with biventricular circulation and myocarditis and/or cardiomyopathy) may experience myocardial recovery and become candidates for VAD decannulation."

    "abstract": "Repeat expansions in C9orf72 are the most common cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia. Repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN) translation generates neurotoxic dipeptide repeat proteins (DPRs). To study endogenous DPRs, we inserted the minimal HiBiT luciferase reporter downstream of sense repeat derived DPRs polyGA or polyGP in C9orf72 patient iPSCs. We show these \"DPReporter\" lines sensitively and rapidly report DPR levels in lysed and live cells and optimize screening in iPSC neurons. Small-molecule screening showed the ERK1/2 activator periplocin dose dependently increases DPR levels. Consistent with this, ERK1/2 inhibition reduced DPR levels and prolonged survival in C9orf72 repeat expansion flies. CRISPR knockout screening of all human helicases revealed telomere-associated helicases modulate DPR expression, suggesting common regulation of telomeric and C9orf72 repeats. These DPReporter lines allow investigation of DPRs in their endogenous context and provide a template for studying endogenous RAN-translated proteins, at scale, in other repeat expansion disorders."

    "abstract": "Lung transplantation (LTx) is the definitive treatment for patients with end-stage pulmonary disease; however, the transplant process often results in variable degrees of renal dysfunction. Ultimately, some patients may require a subsequent renal transplant (RTx). A RTx as an intervention for LTx recipients with underlying kidney failure has been studied, but data about RTx to treat renal failure following LTx are limited. This study aims to explore factors that may predict the need for RTx after LTx and to analyze survival outcomes of this intervention. The International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) Registry was utilized to compare 334 cases of RTx after LTx with 2 control groups who had (1) similarly impaired renal function (n = 1336), and (2) preserved renal function at the time of the LTx (n = 1336). We identified variables such as recipient age, body mass index (BMI), 6-minute walking distance (6-MWD), and history of diabetes as factors to be evaluated in the context of renal function at LTx. RTx post-LTx recipients demonstrated improved survival compared with LTx-only recipients with impaired renal function but worsened survival compared with LTx-only recipients with preserved renal function at LTx. Thus, we identify a possible role for early RTx referral as a strategy to increase survival following LTx in patients with pre-existing renal dysfunction."

    "abstract": "Down syndrome (DS) is a developmental genetic disorder that is associated with an accelerated aging profile and high probability of early incidence Alzheimer's disease like symptoms. It is well established that there are morphological differences in the brains of adults with DS, but the net impact of the genetic disruption on cortical function remains poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap, we used magnetoencephalographic (MEG) brain imaging to assess the somatosensory cortical activity elicited by a paired-pulse electrical stimulation of the right median nerve of adults with DS (N = 19; Age = 28.05 Â± 7.9 yrs.) and neurotypical controls (NT) (N = 21; Age = 30.81 Â± 8.2 yrs.). sLORETA was used to image neural responses to the somatosensory stimulation, which were centered on the left central sulcus posterior to the motor hand knob region. Our results revealed that adults with DS had weaker somatosensory cortical activity after the second electrical stimulation in the paired-pulse paradigm (DS = 594.1 Â± 194.22 AU; NT = 750.48 Â± 256.6; P = 0.038) and a pronounced hyper-gating response (DS = 78.9 Â± 6.8 %; NT = 87.4 Â± 9.9 %; P = 0.003). Together, these results suggest that adults with DS may have an imbalance in the excitatory/inhibitory ratio. These novel data enhance our understanding of the neurophysiological aberrations associated with DS and may hold promise in understanding the origins of Alzheimer's disease like symptoms in this population. Future studies should examine whether these inhibitory alterations are restricted to the sensorimotor cortices or extend across the brain."

    "abstract": "Focal liver lesions (FLLs) are common and are often first identified on abdominal ultrasound examinations. Although CT and MRI were historically required to noninvasively characterize many FLLs, introduction of microbubble contrast agents produced a groundbreaking change as contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) showed vascularity to the capillary level for the first time. CEUS shows specific arterial phase enhancement patterns in benign lesions and accurately differentiates malignant lesions based on the timing and intensity of washout. Parametric time of arrival and microvascular imaging techniques can demonstrate vascularity in FLLs with significantly improved sensitivity compared with conventional Doppler techniques. Shear-wave elastography and quantitative ultrasound are generally used to evaluate diffuse liver disease but show promise in evaluation of FLLs."

    "abstract": "Candida albicans is a fungus that colonizes the gut, oral, and vaginal mucosae of most humans without causing disease. However, under certain predisposing conditions this fungus can cause disease. Candida albicans has several factors and attributes that facilitate its commensal and pathogenic lifestyles including the transition from a yeast to a hyphal morphology, which is accompanied by the expression of virulence factors. These factors are central in candidiasis that can range from invasive to superficial. This review focuses on one example of a superficial disease, i.e. vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) that affects ~75% of women at least once with some experiencing four or more symptomatic infections per year (RVVC). During VVC, fungal factors trigger inflammation, which is maintained by a dysregulated innate immune response. This in turn leads to immunopathology and symptoms. Another unique characteristic of the vaginal niche, is its Lactobacillus-dominated microbiota with low species diversity that is believed to antagonize C. albicans pathogenicity. The importance of the interactions between C. albicans, the host, and vaginal microbiota during commensalism and (R)VVC is discussed in this review, which also addresses the application of this knowledge to identify novel treatment strategies and to study vaginal C. albicans infections."

We tested the utility of plasma GFAP for population enrichment CU populations in clinical trials. We estimated longitudinal progression, effect size, and costs of hypothetical clinical trials designed to test an estimated 25% drug effect on reducing tau positron emission tomography (PET) accumulation in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) and temporal neocortical region (NEO-T). CU GFAP+/AÎ²+ individuals present an increased annual rate of change and effect size in tau PET<sub>MTL</sub> and tau PET<sub>NEO-T</sub> compared to the other groups. An enrichment strategy selecting CU GFAP+/AÎ²+ individuals would require a smaller sample size (â 57% reduction) and fewer AÎ² PET scans (â 74% reduction) than trials enriched with AÎ² PET alone, reducing total clinical trial costs by up to 64%. Our results suggest that clinical trials focusing on preclinical AD recruiting AÎ²+ individuals with elevated GFAP levels would improve cost effectiveness. Cognitively unimpaired (CU) glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)+/amyloid beta (AÎ²)+ shows increased changes in tau positron emission tomography (PET) . CU GFAP+/AÎ²+ enriched clinical trials require a reduced sample size compared to AÎ²+ only. CU GFAP+/AÎ²+ enrichment reduces AÎ² PET scans required and costs.

    "abstract": "To determine the causes of mortality in koalas autopsied at the University of Melbourne based on the retrospective analysis of autopsy reports. The autopsy reports of 239 koalas examined at the University of Melbourne from 1970 to 2023 were reviewed to determine which of the comorbidities present was the primary cause to which death could be attributed. Infectious disease (62 cases) including presumptive chlamydiosis (38 cases), emaciation (38 cases) and trauma (35) were the leading cause of mortality. Death was attributed to other causes in 89 cases, whereas the cause was not definitively determined in 39. Twenty-six different causes of death were identified overall. Presumptive chlamydiosis was the greatest single disease to cause mortality, primarily due to the increased likelihood of leading to euthanasia. Traumatic causes included motor vehicle accidents (16 cases), animal attacks (all from dogs; 5 cases) and malicious acts (1 case). Emaciation resulting in death was attributed to senescence (9), sarcoptic mange (7), starvation (6) and dental disease (6). Sarcoptic mange caused mortality, with or without emaciation, in 16 cases. There was one case each of congenital abdominal hernia, cardiomyopathy, burns and ivermectin toxicosis, and two of oxalate nephropathy. Neoplasms were the cause of mortality in 12 koalas and included five female reproductive tract neoplasms and, importantly, only two lymphomas, in contrast with previous studies in which lymphoma is the most prevalent neoplasm. This is the most comprehensive data analysis of mortality amongst Victorian koalas, and one of the few autopsy studies on koalas. Infectious disease including presumptive chlamydiosis, emaciation and trauma were the leading causes of mortality amongst koalas submitted for autopsy at this institution."

    "title": "Cocreating the Visualization of Digital Mobility Outcomes: Delphi-Type Process With Patients.",
    "abstract": "Recent technological advances in wearable devices offer new potential for measuring mobility in real-world contexts. Mobilise-D has validated digital mobility outcomes to provide novel outcomes and end points in clinical research of 4 different long-term health conditions (Parkinson disease, multiple sclerosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and proximal femoral fracture). These outcomes also provide unique information that is important to patients; however, there is limited literature that explores the optimal methods to achieve this, such as the best way to visualize patients' data. This study aimed to identify meaningful outcomes for each condition and how to best visualize them from the perspective of end users. Using a Delphi-type protocol with patients as subject matter experts, we gathered iterative feedback on the cocreation of visualizations through 3 rounds of questionnaires. An open-ended questionnaire was used in round 1 to understand what aspects of mobility were most influenced by their health condition. These responses were mapped onto relevant digital mobility outcomes and walking experiences and then prioritized for visualization. Using patient responses, we worked alongside researchers, clinicians, and a patient advisory group to develop visualizations that depicted a week of mobility data. During rounds 2 and 3, participants rated usefulness and ease of understanding on a 5-point Likert scale and provided unstructured feedback in comment boxes for each visualization. Visualizations were refined using the feedback from round 2 before receiving further feedback in round 3. Participation varied across rounds 1 to 3 (n=48, n=79, and n=78, respectively). Round 1 identified important outcomes and contexts for each health condition, such as walking speed and stride length for people with Parkinson disease or multiple sclerosis and number of steps for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or proximal femoral fracture. The consensus was not reached for any visualization reviewed in round 2 or 3. Feedback was generally positive, and some participants reported that they were able to understand the visualization and interpret what the visualization represented. Through the feedback provided and existing data visualization principles, we developed recommendations for future visualizations of mobility- and health-related data. Visualizations should be readable by ensuring that large and clear fonts are used and should be friendly for people with vision impairments, such as color blindness. Patients have a strong understanding of their own condition and its variability; hence, adding additional factors into visualizations is recommended to better reflect the nuances of a condition. Ensuring that outcomes and visualizations are meaningful requires close collaboration with patients throughout the development process."

    "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus, particularly type 2 diabetes (T2DM), is a chronic disease associated with serious complications, such as heart disease, kidney failure, and blindness. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems have emerged as a more effective alternative to traditional fingerstick testing, offering patients greater control over their condition. Despite their potential benefits, several barriers to CGM sensor use persist, limiting their widespread adoption among patients with T2DM. This review explores the barriers to CGM sensor use, particularly from the patient's perspective. A systematic literature review is conducted following PRISMA guidelines. The search focuses on studies published between January 2018 and June 2024 and is performed in two primary databases, PubMed and Scopus, selected for their relevance to Type 2 diabetes research. Studies are included if they explore challenges and barriers to CGM adoption, report patient perspectives, or provide insights into the usability and accessibility of technology. The data is analysed using deductive content analysis, applying Wilson et al.'s thematic categories as a predefined framework to systematically classify and interpret barriers to CGM adoption. This approach ensures methodological consistency and alignment with existing research on eHealth adoption challenges. The review identifies several key barriers to CGM sensor use despite the benefits, such as improved glucose control and reduced hypoglycaemic events. Major challenges include the high cost of sensors, wearability issues, discomfort from adhesive materials, and concerns about the visibility of the sensors. Additionally, patients report difficulties in interpreting the large volumes of data generated by CGMs, as well as discomfort or fear related to sensor insertion. Lack of technological support, low health literacy, and insufficient social support are also identified as factors contributing to non-adoption. Policymakers and healthcare providers are encouraged to address these barriers by developing patient-centred strategies that support the adoption of CGM sensors. Successfully overcoming these challenges can further support integrating CGM sensors with the Chronic Care Model (CCM) and Automated Insulin Delivery (AID) systems. As an implication, this integration has the potential to enhance glycemic control and improve patient quality of life in the management of Type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, addressing these barriers may drive advancements in sensor design, improve accessibility, and minimize the environmental impact of CGM sensor use."

    "abstract": "Higher blood pressure in early life may signal cardiovascular disease over the life course, but determinants of blood pressure in early life are poorly understood. To examine the association of maternal cardiometabolic risk factors during pregnancy with offspring blood pressure from age 2 to 18 years and explore whether the association is modified by offspring sex and race and ethnicity. This cohort study analyzed data from the Environmental Influences on Child Health Outcomes program between January 1, 1994, and March 31, 2023. Three common maternal cardiometabolic risk factors during pregnancy were examined: prepregnancy obesity, gestational diabetes, and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP). Maternal cardiometabolic risk factors were retrieved and harmonized from medical records and questionnaires. Offspring systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) percentiles adjusted for age, sex, and height were calculated. Among 12 480 mother-offspring pairs (mean [SD] maternal age during pregnancy, 29.9 [6.4] years; 856 of 12 303 identifying as Asian [7.0%]; 1908 as Black [15.5%]; 2305 as Hispanic [18.7%]; 6522 as White [52.3%], and 712 as other [5.8%] race and ethnicity), at least 1 maternal cardiometabolic risk factor was present in 5537 (44.4%), with prepregnancy obesity being the most prevalent (3072 [24.6%]), followed by HDP (1693 [13.6%]) and gestational diabetes (805 [6.5%]). Offspring born to mothers with any cardiometabolic risk factors had higher SBP (4.88 percentile points; 95% CI, 3.97-5.82 percentile points) and higher DBP (1.90 percentile points; 95% CI, 1.15-2.64 percentile points) at their first blood pressure measurement, after adjusting for potential confounders, compared with their counterparts without any risk factors. Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, alone or with either prepregnancy obesity or gestational diabetes, was significantly associated with higher offspring blood pressure. These associations were generally more significant among female compared with male offspring and among Black compared with other racial and ethnic groups. Among 6015 offspring who had 2 or more blood pressure measures, maternal cardiometabolic risk factors were associated with an increased rate of blood pressure change from age 2 to 18 years (SBP percentile, 0.5 [95% CI, 0.2-0.8] per year; DBP percentile, 0.7 [95% CI 0.5-1.0] per year). These findings suggest that protecting pregnant individuals from cardiometabolic risk factors may promote healthier blood pressure in the next generation."

Furthermore, optimal therapy is uncertain due to lack of direct comparison of androgen receptor pathway inhibitors (ARPIs) and docetaxel in high-volume disease. To evaluate the use of combination therapy and its association with overall survival among patients with mHSPC and to compare ARPIs vs docetaxel doublet therapy by volume of disease. This retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted in the US Veterans Health Administration among 6216 US veterans with de novo mHSPC from January 1, 2013, to December 31, 2022, treated with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) within 3 months of diagnosis. Treatments for mHSPC were collected within 4 months of ADT. Volume of disease was assessed from radiology report review. Data were analyzed from July 2023 to October 2024. Overall survival (OS) and clinical progression-free survival (PFS), indicated by time to castration resistance or death. Among 6216 male veterans with mHSPC (mean [SD] age, 73.9 [9.7] years), use of combination therapy increased from 344 of 637 veterans (54.0%) in 2020 to 465 of 737 veterans (63.1%) in 2022. Among 4106 veterans treated from 2017 to 2022, combination therapy was associated with longer OS (40.3 [95% CI, 38.0-42.1] months vs 33.0 [95% CI, 31.2-35.1] months; hazard ratio [HR], 0.80 [95% CI, 0.74-0.87]) and was used more frequently among younger veterans with fewer comorbidities. Among 1174 veterans with high-volume mHSPC, there was no difference in OS between ARPIs and docetaxel (32.3 [95% CI, 29.5-35.3] months vs 34.7 [95% CI, 31.7-37.1] months; HR, 1.06 [95% CI, 0.91-1.23]); however, ARPIs were associated with longer PFS (18.7 [95% CI, 17.1-20.9] months vs 16.0 [95% CI, 14.0-17.7] months; HR, 0.80 [95% CI, 0.70-0.91]; P = .001). In a multivariable model of high-volume mHSPC, there was no difference in OS between ARPIs and docetaxel (adjusted HR, 0.89 [95% CI, 0.76-1.05]). Among 366 veterans with low-volume mHSPC, there was no difference in OS between ARPIs and docetaxel (68.4 [95% CI, 52.6 months to not reached] months vs 55.3 [95% CI, 41.7-78.9] months; HR, 0.81 [95% CI, 0.58-1.13]), but ARPIs were associated with longer PFS (39.7 [95% CI, 34.3-52.9] months vs 24.0 [95% CI, 20.3-32.9] months; HR, 0.57 [95% CI, 0.43-0.76]). In this cross-sectional study of veterans with de novo mHSPC, use of combination therapies increased over time and were associated with longer survival compared with ADT monotherapy. In both high- and low-volume mHSPC, no differences in OS were observed between ARPI and docetaxel combinations; however, ARPIs had longer PFS. Future research into the role of docetaxel is needed to elucidate the benefit of chemotherapy in mHSPC."

    "abstract": "Communication between the right atrium and left atrium in the presence of an intact interatrial septum is possible, although uncommon. This may occur in isolation or in association with other forms of congenital heart disease. Shunting may occur via unroofing (a deficiency in tissue, which could be due to a lack of formation or the regression of the vessel walls during embryologic development), via anomalous or decompressing veins, or from a combination of multiple anomalies. Surgical correction is typically necessary for patients, as there is a predisposition to develop cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. Echocardiography, cardiac MRI, and CT enable the diagnosis of these shunts. It is crucial for imagers to understand the pathophysiology and identify any associated anomalies that may affect the interpretation, choice of intervention, and treatment outcome.

Individuals with sickle cell trait are permitted to serve in the military. Some research studies have shown that individuals with sickle cell trait may be at increased risk for thromboembolic events. Contraceptive use, specifically combined hormonal contraceptives containing both estrogen and progesterone, has been linked to an increased risk of thromboembolic events. No research has been done to determine if there is an increased risk of venous thromboembolism in a population of females with sickle cell trait who do or do not take combined hormonal contraceptives. To determine if women with sickle cell trait who use combined hormonal contraceptives are at higher risk for venous thromboembolism compared with females with sickle cell trait who do not use combined hormonal contraceptives. Given the increased risk of venous thromboembolism in sickle cell trait individuals in the general population, we hypothesized that females with sickle cell trait exposed to combined hormonal contraceptives would experience higher venous thromboembolism rates than unexposed females with sickle cell trait. Population-based retrospective cohort study of females with sickle cell trait identified from the Military Data Repository to evaluate venous thromboembolism after exposure to combined hormonal contraceptives or without exposure to combined hormonal contraceptives. There were 15,440 unique females aged 18-44 years between 2005 and 2021 who had a diagnosis of sickle cell trait. Approximately 40% of females had an International Classification of Diseases code consistent with a prescription of a combined hormonal contraceptive. Thirty-three (0.2%) of the 15,440 females with sickle cell trait had experienced venous thromboembolism of any type. There was no difference in the prevalence of venous thromboembolism by combined hormonal contraceptive use (yes [0.18%] vs no [0.24%]; <i>P</i>=.454). Being older, married, nonactive-duty military status, smoking, and having a diagnosis of hypertension were associated with a higher prevalence of venous thromboembolism. Although there was a small number of venous thromboembolism events, the findings of this study suggest that the use of combined hormonal contraceptives in females with sickle cell trait is not associated with a detectable signal for increased venous thromboembolism risk as an outcome. Given the potential clinical benefit of combined hormonal contraceptives in pregnancy prevention and menstrual regulation in females, the concerns about combined hormonal contraceptive-associated venous thromboembolism in this population with sickle cell trait seem to be minimal."

    "title": "An Oral Health Survey of Free-Ranging and Captive Koalas From Southeast Queensland, Australia.",
    "abstract": "Good oral health is important for general well-being and longevity. Two-hundred and ninety-five koalas from free-range and captive colonies were examined to determine their oral health status. Two hundred koalas were classified as free-range, whilst 95 were captive from three separate zoological parks. Observations were made using the Koala Oral Health Chart which results in three major indices: the General Oral Cavity Index (GOCI), Oral Health Index (OHI), and Final OHI (FOHI), which describe the current oral health of the population. Eighty-six percent of the koalas had one oral health problem, with 42% of these koalas classified as old aged. The FOHI average from the whole population was 3.76 (SD 3.19, SE 0.20, median 3.00, range 0.14-15.98) with a high variance in individual indices scores. The frequencies of FOHI scoring also showed significant differences between tooth wear classes (TWC) (<i>P </i>= .000), with a sharp increase by TWC 3. This also occurred with the GOCI. The GOCI physical abnormalities were recorded in 141 koalas, with a median of three conditions per koala. Oral Health Index scores were recorded for 219 koalas with the highest of 8.40 in a TWC 7 female. Zoo 3 had significantly healthier oral cavities when the highest FOHI levels of each group was assessed (Zoo 1, 11.42; Zoo 2, 13.40; Zoo 3, 4.13; free-range, 15.98). The FOHI severity levels between free-range and captive koalas based on sex and TWC showed significant variation (sex, <i>P </i>= .000; TWC, <i>P </i>= .000). This study provides index values that can be used for comparison with other koalas or other species in the future."

    "title": "A prognostic microRNA-based signature for localized clear cell renal cell carcinoma: the Bio-miR study.",
    "abstract": "Two thirds of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) patients have localized disease at diagnosis. A significant proportion of these patients will relapse. There is a need for prognostic biomarkers to improve risk-stratification and specific treatments for patients that relapse. The objective of this study is to determine the clinical utility of microRNA signatures as prognostic biomarkers in localized clear cell RCC (ccRCC) and propose new therapeutic targets in patients with a high-risk of relapse. The microRNA profiles from a discovery cohort of 71 T1-T2 ccRCC patients (n = 88) were analyzed using microarrays. MicroRNAs prognostic value was established, and a microRNAs signature predicting relapse for T1b-T3 disease was defined. Independent validation was carried out by qPCR in cohorts from UK (n = 75) and Spain (n = 180), and the TCGA cohort (n = 175). In the Spanish validation cohort, proteomics experiments were done. Proteins were extracted from FFPE tissue and analyzed using by data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry. Additionally, ccRCC TCGA RNA-seq data was also analyzed. Both protein and RNA-seq data was analyzed using Significance Analysis of Micorarrays (SAM) and probabilistic graphical models, which allow the identification of relevant biological processes between low and high-risk tumors. A 9-microRNAs signature, Bio-miR, classified patients into low- and high-risk with disease-free survival (DFS) at 5 years of 87.12 vs. 54.17% respectively (p = 0.0086, HR = 3.58, 95%CI: 1.37-8.3). Results were confirmed in the validation cohorts with 5-year DFS rates of 94% vs. 62% in the UK cohort (HR = 7.14, p = 0.001), 82.9% vs. 58.7% in the Spanish cohort (HR = 2.46, p = 0.0013), and 5-year overall survival rates of 72.7% vs. 44.5% in the TCGA cohort (HR = 2.43, p = 0.0012). Among low-risk patients according to adjuvant immunotherapy clinical trial criteria, Bio-miR identified a high-risk group. Maybe those patients ought to be considered to receive adjuvant therapy. Proteins overexpressed in the high-risk group were mainly related to focal adhesion, serine and inositol metabolism, and angiogenesis. Probabilistic graphical models defined eight functional nodes related to specific biological processes. Differences between low- and high-risk tumors were detected in complement activation and translation functional nodes. In ccRCC TCGA cohort, 676 genes were differentially expressed between low and high-risk patients, mainly related to complement activation, adhesion, and chemokine and cytokine cascades. In this case, probabilistic graphical models defined ten functional nodes. Calcium binding, membrane, adhesion, extracellular matrix, blood microparticle, inflammatory response and immune response had higher functional node activity, and metabolism node, containing genes related to retinol and xenobiotic and CYP450 metabolism, had lower activity in the high-risk group. Bio-miR dichotomizes ccRCC patients with non-metastatic disease into those with low- and high-risk of relapse. This has implications for treatment and follow-up, identifying patients most likely to benefit from adjuvant treatment in clinical trials, preventing unnecessary exposure to side-effects, and providing health economics benefits. Additionally, promising therapeutic targets, as angiogenesis, immune response, metabolism, or complement activation, were found deregulated in high-risk ccRCC patients defined by Bio-miR. These findings may be useful to select patients for tailored, molecularly-driven clinical trials. Identifying which patients with kidney cancer are most at risk of their cancer coming back after surgery is critical, so that they can be prioritized for early treatment. We have identified a combination of biomarkers present in the cancer tissue (called BiomiR) which can help to do this."

    "abstract": "Compared with immunocompetent individuals, those who are immunocompromised, including solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients, have higher SARS-CoV-2-related morbidity and mortality. We determined the duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA positivity to evaluate viral persistence in SOT recipients. This study prospectively followed SOT recipients who recently tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. The duration of viral RNA shedding in nasal swabs and stool samples was tracked, and viral genome sequencing was performed where possible. Persistent infection was defined as a positive nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) for SARS-CoV-2 at 28 days or later after initial infection. This duration was chosen based on the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendation that immunocompromised individuals isolate for at least 20 days [1], compared with 10 days for non-immunocompromised individuals. Of 30 SOT recipients, 12 (40%) had positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA in nasal swabs or stool (cycle threshold [Ct] < 40) at 28 or more days after the first positive SARS-CoV-2 test. Immunocompromised (IC) subject 015 had high viral loads (Ct < 30) at 28 days, with continued detection for 54 days. In 12 of 30 SOT subjects, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected at or beyond 28 days post-detection (dpd), despite vaccination and antibody and/or antiviral treatment in most participants. Three subjects tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA past 50 dpd. Viral persistence in the setting of host immune suppression, coupled with exposure to antiviral treatments, raises concern about the selection of unusual viral variants."

    "abstract": "Enhanced recovery after cesarean delivery protocols include evidence-based interventions designed to improve patient experience, pregnancy, and neonatal outcomes while reducing healthcare-related costs. This is the first update of the Enhanced Recovery After Surgery Society guidelines for antenatal and preoperative care before cesarean delivery after the original publication in 2018. Interventions were selected based on expert consensus using the Delphi method. An updated literature search was conducted in September 2024 using the Embase, PubMed, MEDLINE, EBSCO CINAHL (Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature), Scopus, and Web of Science databases. Targeted searches were performed by a medical librarian to identify relevant articles published since the 2018 Enhanced Recovery After Surgery Society guidelines publication, which evaluated each antenatal and preoperative enhanced recovery after cesarean delivery intervention, focusing on randomized clinical trials and large observational studies (â¥800 patients) to maximize search feasibility and relevance. Following a review of the evidence, a consensus was reached regarding the quality of evidence and the strength of recommendation for each proposed intervention according to the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system. The 6 recommended enhanced recovery after cesarean delivery interventions are (1) antenatal pathway patient education for scheduled caesarean delivery (evidence low to very low, recommendation strong); (2) multidisciplinary medical and surgical staff education regarding enhanced recovery after cesarean delivery support, intervention implementation, and measurement (evidence low, recommendation strong); (3) optimization of the medical care for pregnant patients with comorbid conditions, such as anemia, obesity, hypertension, prepregnancy and gestational diabetes, smoking (tobacco, cannabis, vaping), congenital heart disease, epilepsy, autoimmune disease, and asthma (evidence moderate, recommendation strong); (4) abdominal skin preparation with chlorhexidine gluconate impregnated cloth (evening before scheduled cesarean delivery) (evidence moderate; recommendation weak); (5) the duration of preoperative fasting based on the content intake (evidence low, recommendation weak); (6) the use of a preoperative, nonparticulate carbohydrate drink (evidence low-moderate, recommendation strong). The first 3 recommendations are for use in the antenatal period (10-38 weeks of gestation), which allow for the optimization of patient comorbidities, whereas the remaining 3 recommendations are for preoperative interventions (skin preparation, preoperative fasting directives, and preoperative carbohydrate supplementation). Educational tools for cesarean delivery with well-designed shared decision-making focus on comorbidity management should be developed. These management tasks are viewed as routine care; however, the measurable success and impact have clinical variance. The enhanced recovery after cesarean delivery goal for patients who are undergoing a scheduled caesarean delivery is to maximize the quality of the pregnant patient's recovery and the fetal-neonatal outcome."

    "abstract": "Localised squamous cell carcinoma of the anus is treated with radical chemoradiotherapy. Cure rates are high, but treatment can result in substantial acute and long-term morbidity. We aimed to assess whether lower dose chemoradiotherapy maintains high local control rates in patients with early-stage disease, with the secondary aim of reducing toxicity. ACT4 is a phase 2, prospective, multicentre, open-label, two-arm non-comparative, randomised, controlled trial, investigating reduced-dose intensity-modulated radiotherapy (rd-IMRT: 41Â·4 Gy in 23 fractions) in patients with early-stage anal cancer; T1-2 (â¤4 cm) N0-NxM0. Eligible patients were at least 16 years of age, with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-1. The primary outcome is 3-year loco-regional failure rates. Patients were randomly assigned 1:2 (with stratification by T stage, N stage, gender, HIV status, and randomising site) to standard-dose IMRT (sd-IMRT: 50Â·4 Gy in 28 fractions) or rd-IMRT with concurrent mitomycin and capecitabine chemotherapy. Here, we report the pre-planned, modified intention-to-treat analysis of secondary endpoints 6 months after treatment end-complete clinical response, compliance, patient-reported outcomes (EORTC QLQ-C30 and ANL27), and safety data. The trial is registered at the ISRCTN registry (ISRCTN88455282) and is ongoing but no longer recruiting. 163 patients were recruited from 28 UK tertiary centres between April 24, 2017, and Dec 1, 2020. 160 patients were included in the primary analysis (sd-IMRT n=55; dr-IMRT n=105). Data on ethnicity were not collected. The median patient age was 66 years (IQR 58-72 years); 117 (73%) were female and 43 (27%) male; and 129 (94%) of 138 evaluable samples were p16 positive. Complete clinical responses at 6 months were 87% (46 of 53) for sd-IMRT and 92% (89 of 97) for rd-IMRT. Radiotherapy interruptions of 3 days or more occurred in 14 (26%) of 55 patients in sd-IMRT and 16 (15%) of 105 patients in rd-IMRT. Chemotherapy modifications occurred in 27 (49%) of 55 patients in sd-IMRT and 39 (37%) of 105 patients in rd-IMRT. Grade 3 or worse acute toxicity was reported in 25 (46%) of 55 patients in sd-IMRT and 37 (35%) of 105 patients in rd-IMRT. The most common grade 3 or worse adverse events were radiation dermatitis (seven [13%] of 55 in sd-IMRT and ten [10%] of 105 in rd-IMRT), and diarrhoea (four [7%] of 55 in sd-IMRT and nine [9%] of 105 in rd-IMRT). Serious adverse events occurred in eight (15%) of 55 patients in sd-IMRT and ten (10%) of 105 patients in rd-IMRT. Patient-reported outcomes for most issues deteriorated at the end of treatment and resolved to baseline by 6 weeks in both groups. Poorer sexual function for men and women was observed at 6 months following sd-IMRT. Good 6-month complete clinical responses rates were seen in both groups. Early results suggest rd-IMRT is well tolerated with oncological outcomes maintained. 3-year locoregional failure rates are awaited. Cancer Research UK and Stand Up to Cancer."

    "abstract": "Variations in healthcare perceptions, knowledge and behaviors across different socioeconomic strata and regions underscore disparities in healthcare access and satisfaction levels. The Covid-19 pandemic exposed the vulnerability of forest-dependent communities to increased disease risks and the need to involve local communities in pandemic preparedness through education and awareness regarding disease and ill-health. This article synthesizes the challenges with respect to health and disease, healthcare services, and access to the same among forest-fringe communities. We undertook a Knowledge, Attitudes and Practices (KAP) survey of 35 villages in and around the Mudumalai Tiger Reserve in southern India. Semi-structured interviews using open-ended questions were used to collect information from households on these broad themes: self-reported health issues, healthcare-seeking behaviors, opinion on the healthcare options available to them, risky-behaviors related to disease and ill-health, and self-perceived risk factors for disease or ill-health. Data was also collected on socioeconomic status. Reponses were converted to nominal categories and analyzed using mixed methods. Our respondents self-reported a mix of acute (31%) and chronic (62%) health issues, with undiagnosed fever being the most reported acute ailment (57%). Access to healthcare services showed a preference for government facilities for primary care (63%) but private facilities for surgical procedures (30%, p < 0.05). A substantial portion (15%) reported paying more than a month's income for healthcare services. Education levels seemed to influence perceptions, with higher education correlating to a broader understanding of disease causation (p < 0.05). Lack of basic amenities such as clean drinking water, proper methods of garbage and sewage disposal, and access to nutritious food seem to be important risk factors for disease and illness. Overall, majority of the respondents (76%) expressed satisfaction with government healthcare services, reporting dignified treatment (64%) and regular visits by healthcare workers (74%, p < 0.05). Our study highlights the need to incorporate socioeconomic inequities and barriers while devising healthcare outreach, awareness and service program. We suggest interventions aimed at enhancing healthcare access and promoting healthier practices that mirror the specific needs and socioeconomic dynamics of the local communities for improved community health and well-being."

    "title": "Quantifying feral pig interactions to inform disease transmission networks.",
    "abstract": "Feral pigs threaten biodiversity in 54 countries and cause an estimated $120 billion in damages annually in the USA. They endanger over 600 native species and have driven 14 to extinction. Additionally, they pose a significant zoonotic disease risk, carrying pathogens such as Brucella, leptospirosis, and Japanese encephalitis. Understanding and controlling disease spread relies on models of social dynamics, but these vary widely across regions, limiting the transferability of findings from the USA and Europe to other locations like Australia. This study addresses this gap by analysing the social interactions of 146 GPS-tracked feral pigs in Australia using a proximity-based social network approach. Findings reveal that females exhibit stronger group cohesion, while males act as key connectors between groups. Contact rates are high within groups, facilitating rapid intra-group disease spread, whereas inter-group transmission is slower. Seasonal variations further impact dynamics, with increased contact in summer. These insights suggest that targeting adult males in control programs could help limit disease outbreaks. Given the rising economic and public health concerns associated with animal diseases, the study highlights the need for localized strategies based on feral pig social behaviour to enhance global control efforts."

    "abstract": "Halo blight of hop, caused by <i>Diaporthe humulicola</i>, was first described in 2018 and is a major concern for growers in the eastern United States and Canada. This pathogen can cause quality and yield losses by desiccating hop cones, leading to shatter. However, traditional disease diagnosis is time-consuming, with morphological features taking up to 30 days to develop in culture. To address this issue, a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay based on the translation elongation factor 1-alpha (TEF) gene was developed. We assessed capabilities and limitations of this assay for detection of <i>D. humulicola</i> in plant tissue and investigated aspects of the disease through: (1) testing of hop rhizomes for the presence of fungal pathogens; (2) determining the time required to detect <i>D. humulicola</i> in detached hop leaves; and (3) comparing plating methods with the qPCR assay to monitor <i>D. humulicola</i> in a hop yard. The limit of detection for the assay was 100 fg/Âµl of DNA. The assay showed no cross-reactivity with other hop pathogens, endophytes, or other Diaporthe species tested. Detection of <i>D. humulicola</i> occurred one day after inoculation. The assay detected <i>D. humulicola</i> in both asymptomatic and symptomatic rhizome tissue, but further investigation is required to determine the cause of the observed symptoms. The assay successfully detected the pathogen in individual hop cones and inflorescences throughout the season, with higher positive identification rates than culture-based assays. This assay will provide time-limited diagnosticians a tool for detection of <i>D. humulicola.</i>"

    "abstract": "Magnetically controlled growing rods (MCGRs) have become the current standard in the growth-friendly treatment of patients with early-onset scoliosis (EOS). MCGRs allow noninvasive lengthenings with external lengthening device and reduce the need for surgical procedures. The association of preoperative body mass index (BMI) and the outcomes of the MCGR treatment is not well known. Prospectively collected international database was reviewed for EOS patients treated with MCGR. Patients without preoperative BMI data or follow-up <2 years were excluded. Patients were classified as healthy weight, overweight, and underweight using Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) growth charts. Quality of life was assessed using EOSQ-24. Results were analyzed from the 2-year follow-up. A total of 663 patients were categorized into underweight (n=91), healthy weight (n=417), and overweight (n=155) groups. There were no significant differences in major curve correction or thoracic height increase among the BMI groups, irrespective of etiology. Distribution of BMI categories differed significantly by etiology (P=0.009), with lower healthy weight proportions in the syndromic group (92/167, 55%) compared with idiopathic (131/177, 74%) (adjusted P=0.004), and a higher underweight proportion in neuromuscular (36/244, 15%) compared with idiopathic (15/177, 8.5%) (adjusted P=0.044). Higher BMI z-scores were associated with an increased incidence of complications, including implant-related complications (RR 1.1, 95% CI 1.0-1.3) and implant breakage (RR 1.3, 95% CI 1.1-1.7). Healthy weight and underweight patients experienced lower overall complication rates compared with overweight patients. Implant-related complications were less common in underweight patients compared with overweight patients (RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.20-0.90). Higher BMI z-score was a significant predictor of implant breakage, whereas preoperative major curve, kyphosis, and etiology were not. EOSQ-24 scores did not differ significantly among BMI groups, and changes in scores were comparable across groups during follow-up. BMI status did not influence curve correction, thoracic height increase, or EOSQ-24 outcomes in early-onset scoliosis patients. However, the higher incidence of implant breakage in overweight patients suggests that elevated BMI should be carefully considered when planning treatment. Level III."

GanDouFuMu decoction (GDFMD) is a traditional Chinese medicine, whicn has shown good therapeutic effects in clinical treatment of WD liver fibrosis;but its regulatory mechanism is still unclear. <b>Methods:</b> The serum of WD patients before and after GDFMD treatment were collected, the four items of liver fibrosis were detected by ELISA. The hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activities were assesed via CCK8 assay. The mRNA levels were evaluated by qPCR. The protein levels were checked by western blot. The autophygosomes were observed by transmission electron microscope (TEM). The transdifferentiation ability of HSCs into myofibroblasts was evaluated with anti-Î±-SMA antibody by immunofluorescence (IF). In copper-laden rats with WD, the autophagy levels, and fibrosis level were observed by IF. <b>Results:</b> The four items of liver fibrosis levels were decreased. GDFMD could increase the HSCs cell activity. GDFMD could increase miRNA-29b-3p levels, which was decreased by TGF-Î²1. miRNA-29b-3p inhibitors could reversed the suppression response of GDFMD on the the protein expression of ULK1, beclin1, LC3, Î±-SMA, and Col1.

A retrospective analysis was conducted on medical records from January 1, 2016, to March 30, 2022. Both univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to examine the impact of a low PWR (<26.3) on WD severity, liver complications, and disease progression. Additionally, the effect of splenectomy on PWR was evaluated. The study included 315 patients with WD, among whom 105 had a low PWR and 210 had a high PWR. Those with low PWR exhibited significantly elevated levels of bilirubin, international normalized ratio, prothrombin time, procollagen type-III N-terminal propeptide, type IV collagen, hyaluronic acid, and portal vein diameter. Conversely, they had lower levels of albumin, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides (all <i>P</i> < 0.05). A low PWR correlated with a greater incidence of splenomegaly/hypersplenism, esophagogastric varices, and ascites (all <i>P</i> < 0.05). Furthermore, low PWR independently predicted hepatic decompensation (<i>P</i> < 0.05), and splenectomy led to a marked increase in PWR among WD patients (<i>P</i> < 0.001). A low PWR in WD patients is linked to heightened disease severity, increased risk of liver complications, and rapid progression to decompensation. The results imply that splenectomy, by enhancing PWR, may serve as a viable strategy to slow WD progression."

    "title": "Adalimumab Biosimilars Demonstrate Long-Term Durability and Cost-Effectiveness in Paediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Real-World Two-Centre European Cohort Study.",
    "abstract": "Adalimumab biosimilars are increasingly used in paediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease (PIBD), but data remain limited. This study assessed their durability, efficacy, safety and cost implications in PIBD. Consecutive PIBD patients who started adalimumab biosimilars between October 2018 and December 2023 at two centres in Scotland and Italy, with at least 6 months follow-up, were included. Demographic, disease, treatment, and adverse event data were collected. Disease activity was assessed at baseline, 6, 12, 24, 36 months, and at last follow-up. Durability was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier analysis. In total 130 patients (81 males; median age 12.3 years) were included (115 Crohn's Disease, 7 Ulcerative Colitis, 8 IBD unclassified). The biosimilars were ABP 501 (85%), GP2017 (14%), SB5 (1%); 41 (32%) patients switched from originator. After a median follow-up of 26 months, 87/130 (67%) patients remained on biosimilars, while 43 discontinued at a median of 14 months. Durability probabilities were 93%, 86%, 75%, 62%, and 57% at 6, 12, 24, 36, and 54 months, respectively. Patients previously exposed to ADA originator had a lower risk of biosimilar failure (hazard ratio, adjusted for age at diagnosis: 0.51 [95% confidence interval: 0.26-0.99], p=0.047). Trough levels â¥11.6 Î¼g/mL at 6 months were associated with greater durability (<i>AUC=0.68, p=0.007)</i>. Adverse events occurred in 46/130 patients, mainly psoriasis and injection site reactions (13% each), with one lymphoma. Estimated cost savings were 5,030â¬ per patient/year. This real-life study demonstrated high durability and remission rates for adalimumab biosimilars in PIBD, confirming their clinical, cost-effectiveness and safety profile in children."

    "abstract": "The Pathology, Alzheimer's and Related Dementias Study (PARDoS) is a community-based clinical-pathologic study of aging and dementia in a large and diverse sample of Brazilians. Its long-term objective is to identify the environmental, genetic and molecular drivers of common conditions across the adult life span with an emphasis on Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders clinical and neuropathologic traits. From July 31 <sup>st</sup> 2021 through February 11 <sup>th</sup> , 2025, more than 4,700 brains were collected at two autopsy centers and a major hospital system in the State of Sao Paulo, Brazil. Samples of other organs are also being collected. Their mean age was 71.7 years (range 18-106), 40.2% were Black/Mixed, 52.7% were male, their mean education was 6.3 years (range 0-25). Among those aged 65+, 32.9% had dementia and 18.8% had mild cognitive impairment. Neuropathologic data collection is ongoing. PARDoS fills several major gaps among clinical-pathologic studies given the large numbers and its unique age and education range, and socioeconomic status, race, sex, and other organ collection. Here we present the study design, demographic characteristics of the first 4,790 autopsied participants, and clinical characteristics of the first 4,283 with informant interviews."

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a substantial global health threat. Patients with haematological malignancies have an increased risk of AMR infection due to disease-related and treatment-related immunosuppression. This scoping review searched four bibliographic databases from Jan 1, 2000, to Dec 7, 2023, for publications on AMR bacterial infections in patients with haematological malignancies and identified 274 eligible articles. AMR prevalence data extraction focused on WHO bacterial priority pathogens. The prevalence of AMR bacterial infections from seven WHO priority pathogens in patients with haematological malignancies was 35% (95% CI 30-40; I<sup>2</sup> 99Â·4%). The most frequent AMR infections reported were bloodstream infections, with the highest reported AMR pathogens in third-generation cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacterales (pooled prevalence rate 44% [95% CI 23-64; I<sup>2</sup> 99Â·8%]), meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (43% [31-54; I<sup>2</sup> 95Â·9%]), and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (41% [26-56; I<sup>2</sup> 96Â·2%]). 53 (65%) of the 81 studies that reported mortality showed higher mortality rates associated with AMR infections. 168 (61%) studies were conducted in high-income countries, with no studies published from the WHO Africa region, revealing a substantial data gap from low-income and middle-income regions. Future efforts should prioritise standardised reporting measures, robust surveillance, antimicrobial stewardship, and well designed clinical trials, particularly in under-represented regions, to mitigate the effect of AMR on cancer care."

    "abstract": "Targeted proteomic assays may be useful for diagnosing and staging Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). We evaluated the performance of a 120-marker central nervous system (CNS) NUcleic acid Linked Immuno-Sandwich Assay (NULISA) panel in samples spanning the Alzheimer's disease (AD) spectrum. Cross-sectional plasma samples (n = 252) were analyzed using NULISAseq CNS panel from Alamar Biosciences. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analyses demonstrated the accuracy from NULISAseq-tau phosphorylated at threonine 217 (pTau217) in detecting amyloid (A) and tau (T) positron emission tomography (PET) positivity. Differentially expressed proteins were identified using volcano plots. NULISAseq-pTau217 accurately classified A/T PET status with ROC areas under the curve of 0.92/0.86; pTau217 was upregulated in A+, T+, and impaired groups with log<sub>2</sub>-fold changes of 1.21, 0.57, and 4.63, respectively, compared to A-. Of interest, TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) phosphorylated at serine 409 (pTDP43-409) was also upregulated in the impaired group and correlated with declining hippocampal volume and cognitive trajectories. This study shows the potential of a targeted proteomics panel for characterizing brain changes pertinent to ADRD. The promising pTDP43-409 findings require further replication. The NULISAseq pTau217 assay was comparable to the Simoa pTau217 assay, both utilizing the ALZpath antibody, in detecting amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) positivity, each with areas under the curve greater than 90%. Nineteen proteins were differentially expressed in participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) compared to those who were unimpaired. Markers of non-AD proteinopathies such as pTDP43-409, oligomeric alpha-synuclein, and huntingtin (HTT), were among those upregulated in MCI. High levels of plasma pTDP43-409 were associated with worsening hippocampal atrophy and cognitive decline, clinical indicators of limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE), compared to those with low pTDP43-409."

    "abstract": "The management of psoriatic disease has been revolutionized by biologic medications in recent years. Despite their efficacy and safety, patients are often required by insurance plans in the USA or national formulary guidelines in other countries to try and fail other treatments first, which is a strategy called step therapy. Originally designed to contain costs of specialty drugs, step therapy has a number of negative impacts on patients and providers, both personally and clinically. This article is coauthored by a patient with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis who navigated step therapy. She describes her early experiences with psoriasis and achieving disease control with biologic medication, only to later be diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis and need to revise this treatment plan. She then explains how insurance denials and step therapy impact her life physically, emotionally, socially, and medically. This case is then discussed from the perspective of a dermatologist specializing in inflammatory skin disease. We highlight the psychosocial burden of psoriatic disease, as well as the burden of step therapy and its impacts on patients, providers, and the entire medical system."

Therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) can provide survival with native liver (SNL) in WD. This study was done to see the effect of TPE on outcome and identify factors for SNL. All cases of WD with liver failure (INR. â¥ 2.5) from prospectively maintained data were included for propensity score matching (PSM) to select TPE (n = 48) and no-TPE (n = 48) groups. Three sessions of TPE on three consecutive days were given to TPE group. One hundred fifty-nine cases were included in the PSM with NWI & hepatic encephalopathy (HE) grading as predictors. SNL was comparable (26 vs. 17 cases (OR 1.45, p = 0.05) when the analysis was done in the whole cohort of 96 patients. SNL significantly improved when performed in those with no to early HE: TPE group (24/37) versus no-TPE group (14/34) (OR = 1.70, p = 0.03). Kaplan-Meier survival curves were significantly (log rank 0.019) improved in the TPE group when analyzing in no to early HE. Lower INR (adjusted OR 0.47, 95%CI 0.28-0.79, p = 0.005) and TPE administration (adjusted OR 3.12, 95%CI 1.10-9.4, p = 0.032) at enrollment were independently associated with SNL. Lower NWI (adjusted OR 0.686, 95%CI 0.53-0.89, p = 0.005) at 96 h was independently associated with SNL. TPE is independently associated with improvement in SNL by threefold in patients with NWI â¥ 11 and no to early HE. Patients with advanced HE should be offered immediate liver transplant. After 3 sessions of TPE, NWI < 11 increases SNL by 32%. Hence, NWI should be maintained below 11 with more sessions of TPE."

Here, we investigate whether circulating host-encoded microRNAs (miRNAs) are associated with immune responses to a commercial multivalent clostridial and leptospiral vaccine in Australian Angus steers, a proxy measure for IC. A total of 332 animals from 2 herds in New South Wales, Australia-Herd 1 (n = 168) and Herd 2 (n = 164)-were IC phenotyped on the day of yard weaning. Within a herd, animals were ranked by their antibody- (Ab-IR) and cell-mediated (Cell-IR) immune responses, and animals identified as \"high\" or \"low\" were in the top or bottom 7% of animals for each, respectively. A total of 47 steers that were identified as either low Cell-IR (n = 12), high Cell-IR (n = 11), low Ab-IR (n = 12), or high Ab-IR (n = 12) were selected for miRNA analysis. The IC score, a weighted average incorporating both Ab-IR and Cell-IR rankings, was calculated for selected steers. Our results indicate that the IC phenotype is associated with differences in circulating miRNA profiles. Linear regression modeling identified a potential association between pre-vaccination miR-150 levels and IC scores, while logistic regression modeling suggested that pre-vaccination miR-150 may differentiate IC high and low steers. Machine learning classification models further identified a 5-miRNA signature (miR-192, miR-150, miR-2285co, miR-155, and let-7a-5p) that classified high IC steers with 94% accuracy in this dataset. The findings of this pilot study suggest that circulating miRNAs warrant further investigation as potential predictors of immune response to vaccination and may provide insights into miRNA-regulated pathways involved in vaccine-induced immunity."

Positive Voices 2022 is a questionnaire study of people accessing HIV care in the United Kingdom (March 2022-April 2023). Logistic regression assessed factors associated with a history of COVID-19 (previous positive test), long COVID among those with a history of COVID-19 (ongoing symptoms, with COVID-19 onset >3 months previously) and incomplete COVID-19 vaccine uptake (less than three doses of vaccine), adjusted for: age; gender; ethnicity; and year of HIV diagnosis. In all, 4188 participants were included. Commonly reported negative impacts of the pandemic were on social contact (44% of participants), mental health (30%), healthcare access (26%) and financial security (25%). Overall, 2068 of 4188 (49.4%) participants had a history of COVID-19. Of these, 10.8% met criteria for long COVID, associated with female gender, unemployment, financial hardship, earlier HIV diagnosis date, diabetes diagnosis, asthma/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease diagnosis, obesity and symptoms of depression and anxiety. Overall, 95.8% reported having at least one vaccine dose, but 649 (15.7%) participants had incomplete vaccine uptake, associated with younger age, female gender, Black African ethnicity, lower education, financial hardship, unemployment, multioccupancy household, more recent HIV diagnosis, detectable HIV viral load and symptoms of depression and anxiety. About half of participants had a history of COVID-19, of whom 11% had persistent symptoms (long COVID). COVID-19 vaccine uptake was high, but incomplete uptake was apparent for 16% of participants and was more common among women, younger people, Black African individuals and those with socio-economic disadvantage."

    "abstract": "Testosterone therapy may improve physical capacity and mood in men with chronic heart failure. However, recent findings have raised concerns that testosterone therapy could also increase the risk of atrial fibrillation, pulmonary embolism, and acute kidney injury. Leveraging data from the TriNetX platform from January 1, 2014, to December 01, 2024, we conducted a propensity-matched analysis of two cohorts of patients with heart failure with protein-calorie malnutrition, where the only difference between cohorts was testosterone therapy. The primary outcomes were all-cause mortality and the incidence of acute heart failure, with secondary outcomes including major adverse cardiovascular events as well as cardiovascular, kidney, and thrombotic diseases. After propensity matching, 577 patients were compared across the two cohorts. The findings indicated that testosterone therapy reduced the risk of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 0.56, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0.46-0.68), acute heart failure (HR 0.62, 95 % CI 0.49-0.78), and major adverse cardiovascular events (HR 0.77, 95 % CI 0.61-0.97). Additionally, incident peripheral arterial disease (HR 0.52, 95 % CI 0.30-0.91), coronary arterial disease (HR 0.83, 95 % CI 0.69-1.00), acute myocardial infarction (HR 0.65, 95 % CI 0.48-0.89), and atrial fibrillation (HR 0.79, 95 % CI 0.66-0.95) also favored the testosterone-treated cohort. There was a trend toward an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (HR 1.14, 95 % CI 1.03-1.27) and stroke (HR 1.12, 95 % CI 0.81-1.54) associated with testosterone therapy. These hypothesis-generating findings support potential beneficial effects of testosterone therapy in patients with heart failure and protein-calorie malnutrition."

    "abstract": "Early onset Parkinson's disease (EOPD) has been defined as PD with onset of motor symptoms after age 21 but before age 50. While diagnostic criteria are clear, data suggest that clinicians are still uncomfortable making the diagnosis, resulting in multiple investigations and delays in diagnosis and initiation of treatment. Following the Delphi process, the 15 members of the steering committee of the EOPD study group of the International Parkinson Disease and Movement Disorder Society (MDS) designed and completed a 10 binary or multiple-choice questions survey then met to establish recommendations regarding which investigations are needed for the diagnosis of EOPD. The average age of the 15 respondents (5 females) was 49 years, with 18.2 years average experience in the management of EOPD (range 9-30 years). All geographic sections of the MDS were represented to account for variability of practice. The committee discussed the role of brain MRI, Dopamine transporter (DaT) SPECT scan, laboratory investigation, and genetic testing when suspecting EOPD. If EOPD is suspected on history and examination without any additional findings concerning for secondary or genetic parkinsonism, we recommend limiting investigations to brain MRI and laboratory investigation for Wilson's disease. This may expedite diagnosis and starting the appropriate treatment. Genetic testing is not necessary for diagnosis but can be useful to identify new genetic etiologies which could plausibly be used for trial inclusion."

    "abstract": "The concept of hybrid therapy as separation surgery, followed by stereotactic radiation therapy or stereotactic body radiation therapy, is becoming the new standard of care in the management of metastatic epidural spinal cord compressions (MESCCs). Nevertheless, this new concept remains a form of palliative treatment, and surgical efforts to minimize morbidity and prolong survival serve to maximize palliation. Such strategies include short-segment fixation with cement augmentation, described as 1 level above and below the index level of the MESCC (single vertebral body level). The use of carbon fiber-reinforced polyetheretherketone (CFRP) instrumentation has allowed precise contouring in radiation planning and earlier detection of tumor recurrence, while being biomechanically comparable to standard titanium instrumentation. Therefore, the authors wanted to explore the feasibility of short-segment cement-augmented CFRP instrumentation for patients with spinal metastasis requiring separation surgery. A retrospective review was conducted from April 2022 to May 2024. Inclusion criteria were as follows: 1) patients who had open separation surgery for MESCC, 2) with short-segment cement-augmented CFRP instrumentation (defined as 1 level above and below the index disease level), 3) who underwent postoperative radiation therapy, with 4) a minimum 6 months of survival. Twenty-eight patients met the inclusion criteria. The mean survival was 14.9 months, mean radiographic follow-up was 7.9 months, median estimated blood loss was 300 ml, and mean operative time was 214 minutes. There were no cement- or hardware-related complications. There were 3 cases of postoperative kyphosis, one of which was symptomatic, but all were managed nonoperatively. One patient required a reoperation for repair of a CSF leak. Short-segment cement-augmented fixation is a feasible strategy in open separation surgery for MESCC. This is the first clinical study to incorporate the use of CFRP instrumentation in such a surgical strategy. Additional studies with larger sample sizes and longer durations of follow-up would support both the durability and potential survival benefit over titanium instrumentation."

    "abstract": "Carbon fiber-reinforced polyetheretherketone (CFR-PEEK) instrumentation is increasingly being used in patients with spine tumors as the body of literature supporting its benefit in local disease surveillance and radiation planning grows. Small single-institution experiences with short-term follow-up have yet to demonstrate issues with construct durability despite different biomechanical properties of CFR-PEEK compared to titanium. In this study the authors evaluated CFR-PEEK hardware failures in patients with surgically treated spine tumors who had long-term follow-up. This is an IRB-approved retrospective cohort study of patients with spine tumors who underwent instrumented spinal fusion with CFR-PEEK or titanium instrumentation at a single tertiary care center. Inclusion criteria were as follows: 1) age > 18 years; 2) pedicle screw fixation with CFR-PEEK or titanium; and 3) minimum 6 months of follow-up. The surgical indication was reviewed and agreed upon at a multidisciplinary spine tumor board meeting. A total of 190 patients undergoing CFR-PEEK instrumentation were identified during the study period; 148 had at least a 6-month follow-up. Of those 148, the median follow-up was 13.7 months. In total, there were 861 CFR-PEEK pedicle screws, 266 CFR-PEEK spinal rods, and 15 CFR-PEEK corpectomy cages included in the study. Percutaneous CFR-PEEK instrumentation was performed in 13 cases. There were 6 (4.1%) CFR-PEEK cases of mechanical/hardware failure, with a median interval time to failure of 5.51 (range 2.74-9.38) months. There were no hardware-related complications in the 26 patients who received CFR-PEEK instrumentation and who had a > 24-month follow-up. This institutional experience provides the largest cohort with long-term follow-up to evaluate CFR-PEEK-related instrumentation failure in patients with spine tumors. The rate of hardware failure among CFR-PEEK instrumented constructs was comparable to that in the current literature for titanium implants used in degenerative spine and spine oncology treatment. Importantly, there were no hardware failures noted among patients with extended long-term survival, reinforcing the durability of CFR-PEEK instrumentation."

    "abstract": "<b>Background</b>: The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is a universal clinical measure central to assessing kidney function and to the management of kidney disorders. Several formulas for the estimation of GFR are in use. The European Kidney Function Consortium (EKFC) formula has been reported to more accurately estimate the GFR as compared to the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) formula and its recent version (REFIT equation) in European and African populations. However, validation of the EKFC equation in diverse U.S. populations, especially the Black subpopulation, is needed. <b>Methods</b>: Data from the electronic medical records of 75,442 individuals presenting to a large safety net county hospital with measurements of serum creatinine and/or iohexol clearance studies were used to calculate the estimated GFR (eGFR) and to determine CKD stage using the various reported eGFR formulas. The correlation between eGFR and measured GFR was determined for each equation. <b>Results</b>: The median eGFR for Black participants using the CKD-EPI, REFIT, and EKFC formulas was 130.6 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, 82.0 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, and 80.6 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> (<i>p</i> < 0.001), respectively. For White participants, the median eGFR using the CKD-EPI, REFIT, and EKFC formulas was 145.3 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, 105.6 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, and 99.2 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, respectively (<i>p</i> < 0.001). The REFIT equation underestimates the mGFR in Black individuals at eGFR < 80 mL/min per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup> and in White individuals at eGFR > 20 mL/min per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>. In comparison, the EKFC equation underestimates the mGFR at eGFR > 20 mL/min per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup> in both Black and White individuals. The REFIT equation had the least absolute median bias as compared to EKFC and CKD-EPI in both Black and White participants (<i>p</i> < 0.0001). The P30 of the REFIT and EKFC equations was not statistically different for either Black or White participants (<i>p</i> = 0.16, <i>p</i> = 0.37). <b>Conclusions</b>: Although the accuracies (P30) of the EKFC and REFIT equations are not statistically significant (<i>p</i> = 0.16 and 0.37, Black and White individuals, respectively), adopting the EKFC formula in Americans requires the evaluation of each subpopulation. Both the EKFC and REFIT formulas underestimate the mGFR at a lower eGFR, which may have a direct impact on CKD classification for Black and White patients, with potentially significant implications for clinical management."

    "abstract": "Although attractive for relevance to real-world scenarios, real-world data (RWD) is typically used for drug repurposing and not therapeutic target discovery. Repurposing studies have identified few effective options in neurological diseases such as the rare disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), which has no disease-modifying treatments available. We previously reclassified drugs by their simulated effects on proteins downstream of drug targets and observed class-level effects in the EHR, implicating the downstream protein as the source of the effect. Here, we developed a novel ALS-focused network medicine model using data from patient samples, the public domain, and consortia. With this model, we simulated drug effects on ALS and measured class effects on overall survival in retrospective EHR studies. We observed an increased but non-significant risk of death for patients taking drugs with complement system proteins downstream of their targets and experimentally validated drug effects on complement activation. We repeated this for six protein classes, three of which, including multiple chemokine receptors, were associated with a significantly increased risk for death, suggesting that targeting proteins such as CXCR5, CXCR3, chemokine signaling generally, or neuropeptide Y (NPY) could be advantageous therapeutic targets for these patients. We expanded our analysis to the neuroinflammatory condition, myasthenia gravis, and neurodegenerative disease, Parkinson's, and recovered similar effect sizes. We demonstrated the utility of network medicine for testing novel therapeutic effects using RWD and believe this approach may accelerate target discovery in neurological diseases, addressing the critical need for new therapeutic options."

This review examines established risk determinants for multiple myeloma in Black adults, summarizes evidence linking lifestyle factors, including obesity, physical inactivity, and diet, to disease risk, and discusses energy balance interventions, including cultural tailoring, to mitigate multiple myeloma risk. We summarize current evidence for racial/ethnic disparities in risk factors for multiple myeloma, including unmodifiable heritable factors, modifiable contributors to obesity, including diet and physical activity, and barriers to meeting physical activity and healthful diet guidelines. With this evidence, we present considerations to research lifestyle interventions directed toward risk factors for multiple myeloma. Current foundational scientific evidence in energy balance interventions for cancer risk management is primarily supported in non-Hispanic White populations. Evidence for preventative exercise, diet, or lifestyle interventions for multiple myeloma among underrepresented populations is scarce. Research considerations are proposed to provide strategies utilizing community engagement, primary care education, and importantly, availability of exercise and dietary resources. The importance of tailoring exercise and dietary interventions is also underscored, in addition to generating clinical trial-based evidence to be equitable and beneficial for all populations."

All patients were presented as General group (GG), trembling form (TF), trembling-rigid form (TRF), rigid-arrhythmic-hyperkinetic form (RAHF), extrapyramidal-cortical form (ECF) and abdominal form (AF). To determine the characteristics of the subjective perception of quality of life (QOL) by patients with WD and the effectiveness of their social functioning in general, a method for assessing the integrative indicator of quality of life according to recommendations J. Mezzich. Quality of Life Index is a concise instrument for comprehensive, culture-informed, and self-rated assessment of health-related quality of life. It is composed of 10 items (from physical well-being to global perception of quality of life). Each item is rated on a 10-point scale. The subjective perception was eliminated with general perception, physical well-being, psychological well-being, self-care and independence in actions, working capacity, interpersonal interaction, socio-emotional support, civil and service support, personal realization, spiritual realization. Detection of degree of voluntary-regulatory, cognitive, speech, motor and emotional disorders were performed also for all patients. The results of the study showed that a decrease in the assessments of the general perception of QOL (Î²=-0.64, p=0.00) and the nature of interpersonal interaction (Î²=-0.56, p=0.01) in patients with WD is associated with an increase in the level of depression. Satisfaction with their physical well-being in them is associated with the level of depression (Î²=-0.55, p=0.00) and movement disorders (Î²=-0.30, p=0.03). Subjective perception of psychological well-being in these patients is associated with the degree of anxiety (Î²=-0.48, p=0.00), depression (Î²=0.55, p=0.00) and the level of voluntary regulation disorders (Î²=-0.65, p=0.00). Satisfaction with the level of self-care and independence in actions is associated with the degree of anxiety (Î²=-0.50, p=0.00), rigidity (Î²=-0.50, p=0.00) and movement disorders (Î²=-0.47, p=0.00). Subjective assessments of patients' ability to work are associated with the level of movement disorders (Î²=-0.81, p=0.00) and depression (Î²=-0.34, p=0.04). Satisfaction with socio-emotional support is associated with rigidity (Î²=-0.87, p=0.00) and anxiety (Î²=-0.43, p=0.00). Subjective perception of personal fulfillment in these patients is associated with the degree of voluntary-regulatory disorders (Î²=-0.61, p=0.00) and the level of anxiety (Î²=-0.43, p=0.00). Patients' satisfaction with their spiritual fulfillment is combined with rigidity of behavioral reactions (Î²=-0.75, p=0.00). Thus, the features of the subjective perception of QOL in patients with WD are primarily associated with the characteristics of their emotional sphere, namely, with the level of expression of anxiety-depressive symptoms. The level of subjective perception of quality of life of patients with hepatocerebral dystrophy is associated with a number of clinical and psychological factors, such as the form of the disease, its duration, and the severity of motor and emotional disorders. Thus, the highest assessments of almost all QOL parameters are noted in patients with the abdominal form of WD. Patients with extrapyramidal-cortical and rigid-arrhythmohyperkinetic forms assess their level of physical and psychological well-being significantly lower than other patients."

    "abstract": "Mepolizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets interleukin-5, a cytokine that plays a central role in eosinophilic inflammation, which is present in 20 to 40% of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In a phase 3, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, patients with COPD, a history of exacerbations, and a blood eosinophil count of at least 300 cells per microliter who were receiving triple inhaled therapy were assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive mepolizumab (at a dose of 100 mg) or placebo subcutaneously every 4 weeks for 52 to 104 weeks. The primary end point was the annualized rate of moderate or severe exacerbations. Secondary end points, tested hierarchically to control for multiplicity, were moderate or severe exacerbation as assessed in a time-to-first-event analysis, measures of health-related quality of life and symptoms, and the annualized rate of exacerbations leading to an emergency department visit, hospitalization, or both. Of the 804 patients who underwent randomization, 403 were assigned to receive mepolizumab and 401 to receive placebo. The annualized rate of moderate or severe exacerbations was significantly lower with mepolizumab than with placebo (0.80 vs. 1.01 events per year; rate ratio, 0.79; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.66 to 0.94; P = 0.01). The time to the first moderate or severe exacerbation was longer with mepolizumab than with placebo (Kaplan-Meier median time to the first moderate or severe exacerbation, 419 vs. 321 days; hazard ratio, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.64 to 0.93; P = 0.009). Between-group differences in measures of health-related quality of life and symptoms were not significant; thus, no statistical inferences regarding subsequent secondary end points in the statistical testing hierarchy were made. The incidence of adverse events was similar in the mepolizumab and placebo groups. Treatment with mepolizumab led to a lower annualized rate of moderate or severe exacerbations when added to background triple inhaled therapy among patients with COPD and an eosinophilic phenotype.

    "abstract": "Semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, is a candidate for the treatment of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). In this ongoing phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we assigned 1197 patients with biopsy-defined MASH and fibrosis stage 2 or 3 in a 2:1 ratio to receive once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide at a dose of 2.4 mg or placebo for 240 weeks. The results of a planned interim analysis conducted at week 72 involving the first 800 patients are reported here (part 1). The primary end points for part 1 were the resolution of steatohepatitis without worsening of liver fibrosis and reduction in liver fibrosis without worsening of steatohepatitis. Resolution of steatohepatitis without worsening of fibrosis occurred in 62.9% of the 534 patients in the semaglutide group and in 34.3% of the 266 patients in the placebo group (estimated difference, 28.7 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], 21.1 to 36.2; P<0.001). A reduction in liver fibrosis without worsening of steatohepatitis was reported in 36.8% of the patients in the semaglutide group and in 22.4% of those in the placebo group (estimated difference, 14.4 percentage points; 95% CI, 7.5 to 21.3; P<0.001). Results for the three secondary outcomes that were included in the plan to adjust for multiple testing were as follows: combined resolution of steatohepatitis and reduction in liver fibrosis was reported in 32.7% of the patients in the semaglutide group and in 16.1% of those in the placebo group (estimated difference, 16.5 percentage points; 95% CI, 10.2 to 22.8; P<0.001). The mean change in body weight was -10.5% with semaglutide and -2.0% with placebo (estimated difference, -8.5 percentage points; 95% CI, -9.6 to -7.4; P<0.001). Mean changes in bodily pain scores did not differ significantly between the two groups. Gastrointestinal adverse events were more common in the semaglutide group. In patients with MASH and moderate or advanced liver fibrosis, once-weekly semaglutide at a dose of 2.4 mg improved liver histologic results.

    "abstract": "Study DesignSystematic review.ObjectivesThe pre-symptomatic state of Degenerative Cervical Myelopathy (DCM), wherein degenerative changes and spinal cord compression are seen without clinical findings, is poorly understood and inconsistently categorised. Clear identification may elucidate the temporality of DCM development. Therefore, a systematic assessment was undertaken of current terminology for pre-DCM states, with the objective of standardising definitions and informing an AO Spine expert position statement.MethodsMedline and Embase were searched for all studies on asymptomatic spinal compression or clinical findings preceding DCM, returning 3585 studies. After screening, 96 studies were included in the final analysis. The terminology used for pre-DCM states and their definitions were extracted, along with their frequencies or speciality/country of author in the literature.ResultsMultiple terms were used to represent pre-DCM stages, including \"<i>asymptomatic</i>\" (86 studies), \"<i>non-myelopathic</i>\" (26 studies), \"without myelopathy\" (15 studies), \"<i>pre-symptomatic</i>\" (9 studies) and \"<i>sub-clinical</i>\" (7 studies). \"<i>asymptomatic</i>\" was associated with the greatest inconsistency. Some defined this as patients with radiological signs of spinal degeneration with/without spinal cord compression but no clinical signs of myelopathy, whereas others used the term synonymously with healthy controls. This inconsistency is particularly challenging in clinical studies in which DCM patients are compared to those with pre-DCM states and/or healthy volunteers.ConclusionThere is substantial inconsistency in the terms used to describe pre-DCM states. There is no clear relationship between the terms used and the country or speciality of the main author. Standardised definitions for these disease states should be agreed and used in future studies."

    "abstract": "Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are characterised by dysbiosis and a leaky gut. The NADPH oxidase dual oxidase 2 (DUOX2) is upregulated in patients with IBD, yet its role in driving the disease remains unclear. We interrogated the functional consequences of epithelial DUOX2 activity for the host and microbiome. DUOX2 function was studied in mice with epithelial-specific DUOX2 overactivation (vTLR4), inactivation (vTLR4 DUOXA IEC-KO) and wild-type controls. We assessed the effect of dysbiosis on DUOX2 signalling and intestinal permeability (FITC-dextran, serum zonulin, bacterial translocation) with germ-free (GF) mice engrafted with IBD or healthy microbiota. RNA sequencing of colonic mucosa and microbiota and faecal metabolomics were used to characterise the host-microbe interface. Mechanistic studies were conducted in mouse colonoids, IBD biopsies and patient serum samples. DUOX2 activity increased permeability and bacterial translocation and induced subclinical inflammation in vTLR4 mice. GF vTLR4 mice had increased DUOX2 activity and permeability but no subclinical inflammation. In patients with IBD, DUOX2 expression was positively associated with plasma zonulin levels and negatively associated with ZO-1 expression. Engraftment of GF mice with IBD stool increased DUOX2 activity and triggered low-grade inflammation and permeability defects in mice. DUOX2 activity functionally altered the microbiome, reduced butyrate metabolism and promoted proinflammatory and pro-oncogenic bacterial metabolites. Butyrate and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors blocked DUOX2 activation and reversed its effects. Elevated DUOX2 signalling contributes to epithelial barrier dysfunction, microbiome alterations and subclinical inflammation. Butyrate and HDAC inhibitors reversed these effects, indicating that DUOX2 may be a therapeutic target in IBD."

Participants were members of the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study, a longitudinal study of 1037 people born in New Zealand in 1972-1973. Plasma pTau181, MRI-based brain structure, and DunedinPACE (an epigenetic biomarker of biological ageing) were measured at age 45; cognition was measured in childhood and age 45. We observed a wide range of pTau181 concentrations in our same-aged sample (n=856; M=13.6pg/mL, SD=9.1pg/mL). Males had significantly higher pTau181 concentrations than females. No statistically significant associations were observed with cognitive decline, lower structural brain integrity, or accelerated biological ageing. In this midlife cohort, wide variation in pTau181 concentrations was present by age 45, but was not associated with patterns of AD-risk in cognition, brain structure, or biological ageing."

    "abstract": "Hybrid work schedules are increasingly popular in post-COVID-19 work culture, and their potential for reducing communicable disease transmission is unknown. Our study objectives were to measure and compare carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) concentrations and subsequent infection in an office on \"anchor days\" vs. \"hybrid days.\" We installed two CO<sub>2</sub> sensors in a breakroom connected to multipole staff areas in a 512 m<sup>2</sup> office. Measured CO<sub>2</sub> and office-reported occupancy data informed a Rudnick & Milton-adapted Wells-Riley model to estimate COVID-19 risks. Four modeling cases examined how uncertainty in infection prevalence and the proportion of symptomatic, in-person workers would impact COVID-19 risks. Air exchange rates (AER) were estimated with CO<sub>2</sub> measures. Linear models were used to assess season-adjusted associations between occupancy, day type, and mean and maximum CO<sub>2</sub>. CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations peaked (~1500 ppm) on anchor days in Spring and Winter, with the lowest AERs estimated for these seasons. When assuming the same prevalence of infectious individuals, infection risks on hybrid workdays were 0.06-0.13 less than on anchor days. Behavioral assumptions (i.e., proportions of those who would work in-person even if symptomatic), had a notable impact on infection risk reductions offered by hybrid workdays. Occupancy and day type were associated (p<0.001) with mean and maximum CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations, adjusting for season. We provide initial support that hybrid work schedules may reduce infectious disease transmission. More data are needed to understand how work culture regarding concealed illnesses and preferences for working in person on hybrid days may affect the effectiveness of hybrid workdays in reducing risks."

    "abstract": "Due to the high prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in adults with Down syndrome (DS), trisomy 21 is now considered a genetic form of AD (DSAD). A better understanding of factors that can prevent or delay AD is vital to improve outcomes for adults with DS. In this narrative review, we apply AD and cognitive aging research frameworks to study resistance and resilience in DSAD. Given the variability in the timing of pathology and symptoms, we discuss the evidence supporting the role of genetic, biological, socio-behavioral, lifestyle, and environmental factors in resistance and resilience to DSAD. We also consider how co-occurring health conditions in DS may influence resistance and resilience, and how methods from AD research can be applied to DSAD. Ultimately, this framework aims to guide future research and translate findings into clinical interventions to improve outcomes in DSAD. Highlights Definitions of resistance and resilience in the genetic form of Alzheimer's disease (DSAD) are proposed for guiding the field. Variability in the timing of AD pathology and symptoms suggests the potential for resistance and resilience mechanisms in DSAD. Genetic, biological, socio-behavioral, lifestyle, and environmental factors have the potential to build resistance or resilience in DSAD. Future research will require longitudinal and experimental designs, life course approaches, and large cohort studies."

    "abstract": "There is now emerging evidence to suggest a longitudinal association between specific neurodevelopmental conditions (NDCs) in childhood or adolescence (ie, autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and tic disorders) and certain physical long-term conditions (LTCs) in adulthood. However, to date, this literature has never been comprehensively collated and appraised. As a result, our understanding of all the future health risks that young people with NDCs may collectively be at risk of is limited, and the factors which drive these adult health outcomes also remain obscure. A search strategy has been developed in collaboration with two medical librarians and will be used to conduct systematic searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, APA PsycINFO, CINAHL and Web of Science. Prospective longitudinal studies exploring the association between three common NDCs in childhood or adolescence (ie, ADHD, autism and tic disorders <18 years of age) and any physical LTC in adulthood (ie, >18 years of age) will be selected through title and abstract review, followed by a full-text review. Data extracted will include the definition of exposure and outcome, mediators or moderators investigated, confounders adjusted for, and crude and adjusted effect estimates. Risk of bias assessment will be conducted. Results will be synthesised narratively and, if the data allow, a meta-analysis will also be conducted. Ethics approval is not applicable for this study since no original data will be collected.

    "abstract": "Wildlife surveillance programs often use serological data to monitor exposure to pathogens. Diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of a serological assay quantify the true positive and negative rates of the diagnostic assay, respectively. However, an assay's accuracy can be affected by wild animals' pathogen exposure history and quality of the sample collected, requiring separate estimates of an assay's detection ability for wild-sampled animals where an animal's true disease status is unknown (referred to hereafter as sampling sensitivity and specificity). We assessed the sampling sensitivity and specificity of a Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) surrogate virus neutralization test (sVNT) and conventional virus neutralization tests (cVNT) to detect antibodies for ancestral and Omicron B.1.1.529 variants of SARS-CoV-2 in wild white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus). We studied the influence of sample collection method using paired blood samples collected in serum separator tubes and on Nobuto strips from the same animal. Mean estimates of sampling sensitivity and specificity ranged from 0.21-0.95 and 0.94-1.00, respectively, varying by sample collection method, host species, and SARS-CoV-2 variant targeted by the assay. Broadly, sampling sensitivity was estimated to be higher for 1) sera collected in tubes, 2) detecting pre-Omicron SARS-CoV-2 variants, and 3) sVNT relative to cVNT assays. Sampling specificity tended to be high for all tests. We augmented our study with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein sequences derived from sampling locations and times coincident with white-tailed deer captures, finding common amino acid mutations relative to the sVNT Omicron antigen variant. The mutations may indicate that the SARS-CoV-2 variants circulating in cervids from 2021 through 2024 may be better adapted to cervid hosts and more closely related to variants that circulated in humans prior to Omicron variants. We conclude our study with an inter-test comparison of sVNT results, revealing that 40 % inhibition is an optimal threshold for test positivity when testing deer sera for responses to Omicron variant B.1.1.529, compared to the 30 % inhibition recommended for ancestral variants."

Here, we used mass-spectrometry to compare blood and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) KP metabolites between 158 unimpaired older adults and 177 participants with PD. We found increased neuroexcitatory QA/KA ratio in both plasma and CSF of PD participants associated with peripheral and cerebral inflammation and vitamin B<sub>6</sub> deficiency. Furthermore, increased QA tracked with CSF tau, CSF soluble TREM2 (sTREM2) and severity of both motor and non-motor PD clinical symptoms. Finally, PD patient subgroups with distinct KP profiles displayed distinct PD clinical features. These data validate the KP as a site of brain and periphery crosstalk, integrating B-vitamin status, inflammation and metabolism to ultimately influence PD clinical manifestation."

Using Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) data, we applied an extreme gradient-boosting algorithm and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values to classify cognitively normal (CN) older adults, those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD dementia patients. Features included structural MRI, CSF status, demographics, and genetic data. Analyses comprised one cross-sectional multi-class classification (CN vs. MCI vs. AD dementia, n = 568) and two longitudinal binary-class classifications (CN-to-MCI converters vs. CN stable, n = 92; MCI-to-AD converters vs. MCI stable, n = 378). All classifications achieved 70-77% accuracy and 61-83% precision. Key features were CSF status, hippocampal volume, entorhinal thickness, and amygdala volume, with a clear dissociation: hippocampal properties contributed to the conversion to MCI, while the entorhinal cortex characterized the conversion to AD dementia. The findings highlight explainable, trajectory-specific insights into AD progression."

This anchored indirect treatment comparison (ITC) evaluated efficacy data between proximal complement 3 inhibitor (C3i) pegcetacoplan and factor B inhibitor, iptacopan, in patients with PNH previously treated with complement 5 inhibitors (C5i; eculizumab, ravulizumab). Respective pivotal studies provided patient-level trial data for pegcetacoplan (16-week PEGASUS [NCT03500549]) and published data for iptacopan (24-week APPLY PNH [NCT04558918]). Differences in study design, duration and statistical methods between PEGASUS and APPLY PNH necessitated the comparative analyses to be conducted on secondary measures based on haemoglobin (Hb) levels, absolute reticulocyte count (ARC), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, and patient-reported outcomes on the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-Fatigue) scale scores. The availability of a common reference C5i treatment group in both PEGASUS and APPLY PNH studies allowed anchored ITC (Bucher method). Simulated treatment comparison (STC) assessed the robustness of the main analysis. Overall, baseline characteristics of the populations in the PEGASUS and APPLY PNH studies were broadly comparable. Anchored ITC showed comparable outcomes (mean difference, [95% CI]) on change-from-baseline to end of study for pegcetacoplan versus C5i, and iptacopan versus C5i, respectively, across endpoints: Hb level (-0.49 g/dL [-1.78, 0.80]); ARC (-34.41 Ã 10<sup>9</sup>/L [-90.02, 21.21]); LDH level (-115.16 U/L [-244.40, 14.01]); FACIT-Fatigue score (3.57 [-5.60, 12.73]). Finally, the STC produced results consistent with the main Bucher analyses across all clinical endpoints and patient-reported fatigue, providing similar point estimates and confidence intervals. This anchored ITC, based on data from pivotal trials, did not indicate significant differences in clinical or patient-reported outcomes between pegcetacoplan and iptacopan in PNH treatment. The findings suggest that PNH treatment decisions should also consider individualised disease- and patient-related factors. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03500549."

The present study aims to provide the first comprehensive assessment of clinical experience with expanded carrier screening (ECS) panels in a large cohort from the Jiangxi province of Southern Central China. An ECS panel encompassing 147 genes associated with 155 genetic disorders was initially performed on 5,104 pre-gestational/prenatal females using next-generation sequencing. Following the identification of autosomal recessive conditions in female partners, sequential genetic testing was offered to 1,351 male partners, which included either the same ECS panel or other appropriate genetic tests. Comprehensive reproductive counseling was provided to all the identified at-risk couples (ARCs). Overall, 6,308 participants accepted ECS for 155 conditions (Female: 5,104, Male: 1,204) and approximately 38.43% (2,424/6,308) of them were detected as carriers for at least one of the 155 genetic conditions. The top four prevalent conditions identified in Jiangxi Province were Î±-thalassemia, GJB2-associated hearing loss, Krabbe disease and Wilson's disease. Among the participated cohort, 1,960 females were identified with AR variants and 1,351 male partners received sequential testing, at a recall rate of 68.93%. Among the tested couples, a total of 36 ARCs (36/1,357, 2.65%) were identified with the same AR (n = 27) or X-linked conditions (n = 9). Our study represents the first large-scale demonstration of the substantial feasibility of ECS in the Jiangxi population of Southern Central China. Based on our findings, we propose that incorporating genes with a carrier frequency threshold of 1/2,000 in the screening panel could serve as an optimal criterion. Our findings may contribute significantly to facilitating future clinical implementations of ECS."

    "abstract": "Children in febrile coma in Africa are frequently hospitalised, with poorer outcomes than those in high-income settings. Cerebral malaria is historically the most common cause of febrile coma. Due to limited diagnostic and radiological resources and a decrease in malaria prevalence, there might be under-recognition of non-malarial coma. However, prospective data are scarce. We aimed to determine causes, neuroradiological features, risk factors for mortality, and neurosequelae of children in febrile coma in Malawi. In this prospective cohort study, we enrolled children in a coma (Blantyre Coma Scale score â¤2) who were aged between 3 months and 15 years at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital, Blantyre, Malawi. We used pathogen-specific PCR analysis of blood and cerebrospinal fluid for 15 pathogens including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, Salmonella spp, non-typhoidal Salmonella, Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi (S Typhi), Klebsiella spp, Escherichia coli, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (also using GeneXpert), Streptococcus agalactiae, herpes simplex virus (types 1 and 2), varicella zoster virus, cytomegalovirus, enteroviruses, and SARS-CoV-2; microscopy for malaria; admission brain MRI to enhance the diagnosis of cause and identify brain injury, swelling, and any other complications; and electroencephalography tracings were used identify subclinical seizures or non-convulsive status epilepticus. Assessment of malarial retinopathy was performed by a trained ophthalmologist. We used regression models to estimate risk factors for (and the difference in) 30-day mortality and 180-day neurosequelae (outcome assessed in-person) between children with non-malarial coma and cerebral malaria. Between Jan 31, 2018, and June 30, 2021, we recruited 352 children with febrile coma. Cerebral malaria was the most common cause (in 231 [66%] of 352 children). Pathogenic diagnosis was possible in 289 (82%) of 352 children. Co-infection was identified in 63 (27%) of 231 children with cerebral malaria, of which 49 (78%) were bacterial. The most common non-malarial causes of coma were meningitis (48 [14%] of 352 children) and encephalitis (24 [7%] of 352); 32 (9%) cases had an unknown cause. Compared with standard cultures, PCR significantly increased pathogen diagnosis (p<0Â·0001), with the highest yield in patients with meningitis (seven [15%] of 48 vs 30 [63%] of 48). S pneumoniae (n=44) and non-typhoidal salmonella or S Typhi (n=24) were the most frequently detected bacterial pathogens. Brain parenchymal abnormalities were identified on MRI in most children with febrile coma (165 [92%] of 178), and were significantly more common in children with non-malarial coma (68 [100%] of 68]) than cerebral malaria (98 [89%] of 110; p<0Â·0001). Overall, at 30 days after discharge, death (69 [21%] of 323) or any neurological impairment (163 [50%] of 323) were common, but poorer long-term outcomes were more frequent following non-malarial coma than cerebral malaria (death at 30 days: 32 [28%] of 114 vs 37 [18%] of 209, p=0Â·029; severe neurological impairment at 180 days: 19 [17%] of 114 vs 15 [7%] of 209, p=0Â·0079). Children who had cerebral malaria with CNS co-infection had higher mortality (ten [37%] of 27) than those with cerebral malaria alone (19 [12%] of 154, p=0Â·0033). Despite malaria control efforts, cerebral malaria remains the most common cause of febrile coma in Malawi. However, non-malarial coma causes a greater disease burden (death and disability), and a higher case-fatality rate was observed in non-malarial coma and cerebral malaria with non-malarial co-infection than cerebral malaria alone. To adequately treat severe invasive bacterial infections, that are frequently not detected in routine clinical practice, commencing empirical antimicrobials in all children in febrile coma, including those with cerebral malaria, could and should be rapidly implemented across Africa and must be considered. The study highlights the value of molecular diagnostics and imaging to guide diagnosis. The frequent findings of brain abnormalities from imaging at admission emphasises the need for earlier escalation of children with febrile coma to specialist care. Further work is needed to develop feasible molecular and radiological diagnostics for their successful deployment across the continent. Implementation of these methods could improve diagnosis and outcomes for children with febrile coma in Africa.

    "title": "The aetiologies, mortality, and disability of non-traumatic coma in African children: a systematic review and meta-analysis.",
    "abstract": "Non-traumatic coma in African children is a common life-threatening presentation often leading to hospital attendance. We aimed to estimate the distribution of non-traumatic coma causes and outcomes, including disease-specific outcomes, for which evidence is scarce. We systematically reviewed MEDLINE, Embase, and Scopus databases from inception to Feb 6, 2024. We included studies recruiting children (aged 1 month to 16 years) with non-traumatic coma (Blantyre Coma Scale score â¤2, ie deep coma or comparable alternative) from any African country. Disease-specific studies were included if outcomes were reported. Primary data were requested where required. We used a DerSimonian-Laird random effects model to calculate pooled estimates for prevalence of causes, mortality, and morbidity (in-hospital and post-discharge), including analysis of mortality by temporality. This study was registered with PROSPERO (CRD4202014193). We screened 16 666 articles. 138 studies were eligible for analysis, reporting causes, outcome data, or both from 35 027 children with non-traumatic coma in 30 African countries. 114 (89%) of 128 studies were determined to be high quality. Among the causes, cerebral malaria had highest pooled prevalence at 58% (95% CI 48-69), encephalopathy of unknown cause was associated with 23% (9-36) of cases, and acute bacterial meningitis was the cause of 10% (8-12) of cases, with all other causes representing lower proportions of cases. Pooled overall case-fatality rates were 17% (16-19) for cerebral malaria, 37% (20-55) for unknown encephalopathy, and 45% (34-55) for acute bacterial meningitis. By meta-regression, there was no significant difference in cerebral malaria (p=0Â·98), acute bacterial meningitis (p=0Â·99), or all-cause coma (p=0Â·081) mortality by year of study. There was no substantial difference in deaths associated with cerebral malaria in-hospital compared with post-discharge (17% [16-19] vs (18% [16-20]). Mortality was higher post-discharge than in-hospital in most non-malarial comas, including acute bacterial meningitis (39% [26-52]) vs 53% [38-69]). Disability associated with cerebral malaria was 11% (9-12). Pooled disability outcomes associated with other non-malarial diseases were largely absent. The prevalence and outcomes of cerebral malaria and meningitis associated with non-traumatic coma were strikingly static across five decades. Enhanced molecular and radiological diagnostics, investment, policy making, community awareness, and health service provision are all required to facilitate earlier referral to specialist centres, to drive a step-change in diagnostic yield and treatment options to improve these outcomes.

    "title": "Navigating healthcare during the pandemic: Experiences of racialized immigrants and racialized non-immigrants in Ontario's Peel Region.",
    "abstract": "While public health policies implemented during COVID-19, such as prioritizing essential health services and \"no visitor\" strategies, were important to treat COVID-19 patients and curb disease outbreaks, their potential negative effects on the health of the general population is a growing concern. Research highlights that these policy changes contributed to a near-universal decline in access to all healthcare services and triggered increased morbidity and mortality rates. However, little is known about how health policy changes differentially shaped healthcare access within and between population groups and regions. Few studies qualitatively examine the indirect effects of policy changes on healthcare access among groups disproportionately impacted by COVID-19. This article examines how COVID-19 health policy changes impacted racialized immigrant and racialized non-immigrants' ability to connect with a provider, navigate telehealth and in-person healthcare, and access specialized healthcare in the Peel Region of Ontario, Canada. Using a Client Centered Framework, findings from in-depth interviews (n = 79) reveal that policy changes generated new (in)abilities for individuals to perceive, seek, reach, pay and engage in healthcare services. Health policy changes created new barriers to reach healthcare, compounding health challenges. While telehealth opened more effective avenues to access healthcare among some people, it created new disparities for individuals with limited English language skills and/or for those experiencing technological inequities. Although individuals recognized their need for specialized healthcare, the prioritization of essential services, gaps in health insurance coverage, and new COVID-19 economic inequities created barriers to specialized healthcare. We close with a discussion of the impacts for policy and practice."

    "abstract": "While previous reports have suggested an association between Wilson's disease (WD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), we present the first case of asymptomatic WD diagnosed during the treatment course of UC. A 14-year-old male receiving treatment for UC developed elevated liver enzymes without any related symptoms. After ruling out drug-induced liver toxicity and other possible causes of hepatitis, further investigation was initiated due to his sister's subsequent diagnosis of WD. Tests revealed low serum ceruloplasmin and ATP7B gene variants, confirming WD. Following zinc therapy, liver enzymes have been normalized, and his previously refractory UC became under control. This case raises important questions about potential pathophysiological interactions between the two diseases."

    "abstract": "Patients with chronic kidney disease are at increased risk of stroke and frequently have cerebral microbleeds. Whether such patients also encounter an increased risk of recurrent stroke has not been firmly established. We aimed to determine whether impaired kidney function is associated with the risk of recurrent stroke, and microbleed presence, distribution and severity. We used pooled data from the Microbleeds International Collaborate Network to investigate associations of impaired kidney function, defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <60 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>. Our primary outcome was a composite of recurrent ischaemic stroke (IS) and intracranial haemorrhage (ICrH). Secondary outcomes included: (1) individual components of the primary outcome; (2) modification of the primary outcome by microbleed presence or anticoagulant use and (3) microbleed presence, distribution and severity. 11 175 patients (mean age 70.7Â±12.6, 42% female) were included, of which 2815 (25.2%) had impaired kidney function. Compared with eGFR â¥60, eGFR <60 was associated with a higher risk of the primary outcome (adjusted HR, aHR 1.33 (95% CI 1.14 to 1.56), p<0.001) and higher rates of the recurrent IS (aHR 1.33 (95% CI 1.12 to 1.58)). Reduced eGFR was not associated with ICrH risk (aHR 1.07 (95% CI 0.70 to 1.60)). eGFR was also associated with microbleed presence (adjusted OR, aOR 1.14 (95% CI 1.03 to 1.26)) and severity (aOR 1.17 (95% CI 1.06 to 1.29)). Compared with having no microbleeds, eGFR was lower in those with strictly lobar microbleeds (adjusted mean difference (aMD) -2.10 mL/min/1.73 cm<sup>2</sup> (95% CI -3.39 to -0.81)) and mixed microbleeds (aMD -2.42 (95% CI -3.70 to -1.15)), but not strictly deep microbleeds (aMD -0.67 (95% CI -1.85 to 0.51)). In patients with IS or transient ischaemic attack, impaired kidney function was associated with a higher risk of recurrent stroke and higher microbleeds burden, compared with those with normal kidney function. Further research is needed to investigate potential additional measures for secondary prevention in this high-risk group."

    "abstract": "Men who have sex with men (MSM) are at high risk for human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and resulting anal cancer. Guidelines for HPV vaccination for MSM above age 26 years recommend shared clinical decision-making. Our objectives were to measure history of HPV vaccination and identify disparities in vaccination in a community-recruited sample of MSM in 2023 in San Francisco. Data originated from National HIV Behavioral Surveillance. Time-location sampling recruited participants through outreach at venues where MSM congregate during randomly selected times. Face-to-face interviews collected demographics, risk and preventive behaviors, access to healthcare, and HIV status. Multivariable logistic regression analysis assessed factors associated with HPV vaccination. Among 497 MSM respondents, 44.9% reported HPV vaccination. HPV vaccination was more likely for MSM aged 18-29 years vs. older (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 4.84, 95% CI 2.37-9.87), having a college degree vs. less education (AOR 1.74, 95% CI 1.18-2.57), seeing a healthcare provider in the last 12 months (AOR 3.60, 95% CI 1.62-8.01), and diagnosed with an STD (AOR 1.97, 1.30-2.99). Among MSM not living with HIV, using PrEP in the last 12 months had an increased odds of HPV vaccination (AOR 4.53, 95% CI 2.69-7.63). Under half of MSM in San Francisco reported HPV vaccination. We recommend healthcare providers verify vaccination history and more routinely offer HPV vaccine to unvaccinated MSM at any age. MSM living with HIV should consider HPV vaccination given confirmed safety, strong immune response, and some data on efficacy, even while awaiting further clinical studies."

    "abstract": "Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is the most common genetic cause of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but considerable phenotypic variability exists among affected individuals who share disease-causing variants. Therefore, a multi-center longitudinal cohort study of 270 adult participants with PiZZ AATD will be established with goal of examining how computed tomography (CT) imaging and serum and airway biomarkers can be used to explain differences in phenotypic manifestations and outcomes. Study visits at enrollment, 18 months and 36 months will obtain spirometry, patient-reported outcomes and biosampling from blood, nasal mucosa and sputum. Chest CT image acquisition will be utilized for whole lung and lobar estimations of emphysema based on lung density and to test novel measurements of airway remodeling and lung tissue mechanics. Dried blood spot cards will be collected if the participant experiences an acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD) during the study. Genetic analysis will be performed with complete SERPINA1 sequencing, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) will be isolated to generate a repository of inducible pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). The cohort will be deeply characterized including imaging, physiology, and symptomatology cross-sectionally and longitudinally over a 3-year follow-up period. A validation cohort from Ireland will independently enroll patients with identical procedures. This is the first cohort of AATD to incorporate such detailed metrics of disease including quantitative emphysema measures with the overarching goal of improving the understanding of disease heterogeneity in AATD and identifying factors associated with disease severity and progression."

It is characterized by developmental delay, Hirschsprung's disease, seizures, and a wide variety of malformations affecting the neurologic, cardiac, and genitourinary systems. Reports describing the findings of Mowat-Wilson Syndrome at autopsy are sparse. Case reports of suprasellar spindle cell lipomas are even rarer, a circumstance that contributes to uncertainty regarding their etiology as true neoplasms rather than congenital malformations. Here we report the gross, histopathologic, and molecular findings of a 4-year-old female with Mowat-Wilson Syndrome presenting with sepsis in the setting of otitis media and incidentally found to have a rare suprasellar spindle cell lipoma demonstrating loss of <i>RB1</i> by immunohistochemistry, suggestive of a neoplastic etiology."

    "abstract": "N- and C-terminal Î±-synuclein (Î±-syn) truncations are prevalent in Parkinson's disease. Effects of the N- and C-terminal residues on Î±-syn aggregation and fibril propagation are distinct, where the N-terminus dictates fibril structure. Here, the majority of Î±-syn truncations are assigned by intact mass spectrometry to lysosomal activity. To delineate essential charged residues in fibril formation, we selected an N-terminal truncation (66-140) that is generated solely from soluble Î±-syn by asparagine endopeptidase. Ala-substitutions at K80 and E83 impact aggregation kinetics, revealing their vital roles in defining fibril polymorphism. K80, E83, and K97 are identified to be critical for fibril elongation. Based on solid-state NMR, mutational and Raman studies, and molecular dynamics simulations, a E83-K97 salt bridge is proposed. Finally, participation of C-terminal Lys residues in the full-length Î±-syn fibril assembly process is also shown, highlighting that individual residues can be targeted for therapeutic intervention."

    "abstract": "In bronchiectasis, neutrophilic inflammation is associated with an increased risk of exacerbations and disease progression. Brensocatib, an oral, reversible inhibitor of dipeptidyl peptidase 1 (DPP-1), targets neutrophil serine proteases, key mediators of neutrophilic inflammation. In a phase 3, double-blind trial, we randomly assigned patients with bronchiectasis (in a 1:1:1 ratio for adults and a 2:2:1 ratio for adolescents) to receive brensocatib (10 mg or 25 mg once per day) or placebo. The primary end point was the annualized rate of adjudicated pulmonary exacerbations over a 52-week period. The secondary end points, listed in hierarchical testing order, were the time to the first exacerbation during the 52-week period; the percentage of patients remaining exacerbation-free at week 52; the change in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV<sub>1</sub>); the annualized rate of severe exacerbations; and change in quality of life. A total of 1721 patients (1680 adults and 41 adolescents) underwent randomization and received brensocatib or placebo. The annualized rate of pulmonary exacerbations was 1.02 in the 10-mg brensocatib group, 1.04 in the 25-mg brensocatib group, and 1.29 in the placebo group (rate ratio, brensocatib vs. placebo, 0.79 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.68 to 0.92; adjusted P = 0.004] with the 10-mg dose and 0.81 [95% CI, 0.69 to 0.94; adjusted P = 0.005] with the 25-mg dose). The hazard ratio for the time to the first exacerbation was 0.81 (95% CI, 0.70 to 0.95; adjusted P = 0.02) with the 10-mg dose and 0.83 (95% CI, 0.70 to 0.97; adjusted P = 0.04) with the 25-mg dose. In each brensocatib group, 48.5% of patients remained exacerbation-free at week 52, as compared with 40.3% in the placebo group (rate ratio, 1.20 [95% CI, 1.06 to 1.37; adjusted P = 0.02] with the 10-mg dose and 1.18 [95% CI, 1.04 to 1.34; adjusted P = 0.04] with the 25-mg dose). At week 52, FEV<sub>1</sub> had declined by 50 ml with the 10-mg dose, 24 ml with the 25-mg dose, and 62 ml with placebo (least-squares mean difference vs. placebo, 11 ml [95% CI, -14 to 37; adjusted P = 0.38] with the 10-mg dose and 38 ml [95% CI, 11 to 65; adjusted P = 0.04] with the 25-mg dose). The incidence of adverse events was similar across groups, except for a higher incidence of hyperkeratosis with brensocatib. Among patients with bronchiectasis, once-daily treatment with brensocatib (10 mg or 25 mg) led to a lower annualized rate of pulmonary exacerbations than placebo, and the decline in FEV<sub>1</sub> was less with the 25-mg dose of brensocatib than with placebo.

We evaluated weight change and the effect of weight gain on outcomes over 5 years on four diabetes medications. The Glycemia Reduction Approaches in Diabetes: A Comparative Effectiveness Study (GRADE) randomized trial compared the addition of insulin glargine, glimepiride, liraglutide, or sitagliptin to metformin in participants with T2D. We report weight change and hazard ratio (HR) per kilogram of weight change for HbA1c >7.5%; cardiovascular disease (CVD), kidney disease, and neuropathy outcomes; and diabetes treatment satisfaction. Participants (n = 4,980) were 57 Â± 10 years, 44% non-White, with HbA1c 7.5% Â± 0.5%, and BMI 34.3 Â± 6.8 kg/m2. Mean (95% CI) weight change (kg) during the first year was -3.5 (-3.8,-3.2) with liraglutide,-1.07 (-1.4,-0.78) with sitagliptin, 0.45 (0.16, 0.74) with glargine, and 0.89 (0.60, 1.2) with glimepiride (P < 0.0001). Thereafter, weight decreased in all groups. Weight gain within the first 6 months was associated with increased risk of HbA1c >7.5%, with modest differences by treatment, and with subsequent CVD (HR 1.03 [95% CI 1.005, 1.06]). Weight gain at 1 year was associated with increased risk of HbA1c >7.5% (HR 1.05 [1.04, 1.07]) and kidney disease (HR 1.03 [1.01, 1.06]). Baseline weight, but not weight gain, was associated with new-onset neuropathy. Weight gain was associated with lower diabetes treatment satisfaction. Liraglutide and sitagliptin were associated with initial weight loss and glargine and glimepiride with slight weight gain, followed by weight loss in metformin-treated T2D. Weight gain was associated with worsening glycemia and increased risk of cardiovascular and kidney outcomes largely independent of treatment."

Betanodavirus infection was initially detected by betanodavirus reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR and nested PCR. Sequencing confirmed the red-spotted grouper nervous necrosis virus (RGNNV) genotype of betanodavirus. The RGNNV genotype of betanodavirus has previously been detected in Australia in fish, including barramundi (Lates calcarifer) and striped trumpeter (Latris lineata). Immunohistochemistry using antibodies directed against the capsid protein of betanodavirus demonstrated intralesional virus antigen. Betanodavirus targeted the brain, spinal cord and retina, causing intracytoplasmic vacuolation of neuronal processes and neuronal necrosis."

HCPs tried to identify the 'tipping point' between quantity and quality of life for the individual and their family, taking into account the likelihood of a higher burden of care. HCPs drew on prior experience to assess anticipated quality of life, yet most HCPs in the UK have limited experience of TV for this group. HCPs also drew on principles of person-centered care, patient autonomy and value for money to guide their approach to discussing TV. <i>Conclusions:</i> HCP experience of positive outcomes of TV can foster a more proactive approach to initiating conversations about its potential use. Sharing best practice and improving guidance for HCPs may support early and on-going future care planning and enable people with ALS to make choices which are informed and in their best interests."

    "abstract": "Hepatolenticular degeneration (HLD), also known as Wilson's disease, is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene. Due to defective copper excretion in the liver, excess copper accumulates in tissues such as the liver, brain, kidneys, and corneas. Clinically, this manifests as liver dysfunction, motor disturbances, psychiatric symptoms, and damage to the kidneys and eyes. Liver transplantation, by replacing the diseased liver with a healthy donor liver, addresses the underlying genetic defect, disrupting the cycle of copper accumulation and systemic damage, and is currently the only curative treatment for the disease. This case report discusses a 17-year-old male diagnosed with HLD for one year who developed severe liver failure and underwent emergency liver transplantation. The patient's critical condition meant that the comprehensiveness and effectiveness of postoperative nursing care were crucial to his outcome. This case study utilized a core Nursing Outcomes Classification system for liver transplantation, previously developed through research, and achieved satisfactory results based on the actual data from the patient."

    "abstract": "The Package of Essential Noncommunicable (PEN) disease interventions in response to the high prevalence of cardiovascular diseases and diabetes was implemented in Fiji commencing in 2012. This study aimed to understand implementation outcomes, and its contextual influences. Semi-structured interviews with health workers and patients across Fiji was conducted. Thematic analysis was mapped to the health system building blocks to understand PEN service delivery. The PEN program was well received by health workers formally trained. The frequency of use of PEN guidelines was influenced at the individual level by motivation, capability and capacity as well as external factors outside of the health workers' control. The key challenges to routine use were lack of essential medicines and equipment for CVD risk screening and management, shortage of health workers, high turnover of staff, limited formal training, and no designated focal person. However, at the country level, the PEN program improved the quality of care by providing patients with regular follow-up visits depending on their CVD risk levels. The patients found care to be comprehensive when they were also seen by dieticians and physiotherapists. In most instances, the barrier to access to care were cost and distance of travel and non-availability of essential medicines. To improve use of PEN program requires strengthening health system components: 1) need for efficient supply chain system for medicines and equipment, 2) improving healthcare workforce retention, 3) establishing accountability mechanisms embedded within the health centres, 4) health information system to track patient level data and 5) multi-level governance structures across the health system."

We also examined the neuropsychological profiles of the PWH group by amyloid-PET status, cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Virally suppressed PWH were sought for a study of HAND where amyloid-PET positivity was used to exclude the possibility of AD. Participants underwent a standardized neuropsychological battery to diagnose HAND. Age and sex-matched cognitively unimpaired PWoH were identified from a separate cohort at our site. No participant from either group showed clinical signs and symptoms in a pattern concerning for AD. All participants completed amyloid-PET ([18F]Florbetapir). A certified neurologist visually read these as amyloid positive (PET+) or negative (PET-). Compared to cognitively unimpaired PWoH (n=65, mean age=67), the cognitively impaired PWH group (n=74, mean age=69) was predominantly male (94.6% vs. 72.3%, p<0.001), of non-hispanic white ethnicity (74.3% vs. 83.1%, p=0.211) and reported lower educational attainment (16.2 vs. 17.4 years, p<0.001). Among them, 6 (8.1%) had PET+ scans compared to 14 PWoH (21.5 %, p=0.024). Within the PWH group, we did not identify differences in the neuropsychological testing pattern by amyloid-PET status (all p-values >0.05). Cognitively impaired PWH did not show increased frequency of amyloid positivity relative to cognitively unimpaired PWoH. Among PWH, cognitive performance did not differ by amyloid-PET status in analyses of cross-sectional baseline and longitudinal performance."

    "title": "Intrathecal Baclofen Therapy Improves Refractory Status Dystonicus in Neuro-hepatic Wilson's Disease: A Case Report.",
    "abstract": "Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism. A current unresolved issue is the worsening of neurological symptoms during the initial treatment phase, particularly with chelation therapy. This phenomenon, termed \"early neurological worsening,\" is attributed to the rapid mobilization and redistribution of copper during treatment initiation. We report the case of a 10-year-old boy, with neuro-hepatic Wilson's disease who developed treatment-refractory generalized dystonia, which improved with intrathecal baclofen therapy. The patient experienced walking discomfort 5 months before referral to our hospital, with rapid progression to dysphagia and a 3 kg weight loss. Initially, he presented with dystonia, including foot inversion. Wilson's disease was diagnosed based on physiological, clinical, and imaging findings, with confirmation of a homozygous mutation in the <i>ATP7B</i> gene. The patient was treated with trientine hydrochloride, followed by zinc monotherapy. Despite appropriate chelation therapy, dystonia progressed to severe axial torsion involving the trunk. His condition deteriorated to status dystonicus, with high-grade fever, elevated creatine phosphokinase levels, and dehydration, requiring midazolam sedation. These symptoms were attributed to \"early neurological worsening.\" A trial of intrathecal baclofen injection provided symptom relief, leading to the implantation of a baclofen pump, which significantly reduced the status dystonicus. At discharge, the patient had a modified Rankin Scale score of 5. Three years later, although wheelchair-dependent, his oral intake and speech are progressively improving with training. This is the first reported case of status dystonicus in Wilson's disease successfully treated with intrathecal baclofen, highlighting its potential as a viable treatment option for Wilson's disease-associated debilitating dystonia."

    "abstract": "Steatotic liver disease (SLD) is prevalent among individuals with chronic hepatitis B virus (CHB), yet its impact on clinical outcomes remains controversial. We used electronic health record data from 98 US healthcare-delivery systems to compare adults with (CHB-SLD) and without SLD (CHB-wo-SLD) from 2000 to 2024. We applied 1: 1 propensity score matching to balance cohorts by demographic and clinical characteristics. We further performed sensitivity analyses in the presence or absence of cirrhosis. We compared incidence rates (IR) and hazard ratios (HRs) of all-cause mortality, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), end-stage liver disease (ESLD) events, and detectable HBsAg and HBeAg as markers of seroclearance. Among 124,932 individuals with CHB (12.43% CHB-SLD), there were 470,707 person-years of observations (median follow-up 2.95 years). Compared with CHB, individuals with CHB-SLD had a lower mortality risk (HR 0.44, 95% CI 0.40-0.48). Fibrosis risk was higher among those with CHB-SLD (vs CHB-wo-SLD) (HR 1.93, 95% CI 1.71-2.19); however, cirrhosis risk was comparable (HR 1.06, 95% CI 0.96-1.18) between cohorts, while HCC risk was lower in the CHB-SLD cohort (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.70-0.96). The CHB-SLD cohort also had significantly reduced risks of ESLD events, including ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, variceal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy, and hepatorenal syndrome (all p < 0.001). Additionally, detectable HBsAg and HBeAg IRs and HRs were lower among CHB-SLD compared to the CHB-wo-SLD cohort: 26.83 vs. 31.96 per 1,000 person-years (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.73-0.87) and 8.52 vs. 11.36 per 1,000 person-years (HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.65-0.85), respectively. Sensitivity analyses stratified by cirrhosis status supported these findings. CHB-SLD status was associated with more favorable outcomes, highlighting the complexity of CHB and SLD interactions."

    "abstract": "Prostate cancer is one of the most frequently diagnosed cancers in men. Prostate tumor staging and disease aggressiveness are evaluated based on the Gleason scoring system, which is further used to direct clinical intervention. The Gleason scoring system provides an estimate of tumor aggressiveness through quantitation of the serum level of prostate specific antigen (PSA) and histologic assessment of Grade Group, determined by the Gleason Grade of the tumor specimen. To improve our understanding of the proteomic characteristics differentiating low- versus high-grade prostate cancer tumors, we performed a deep proteomic characterization of laser microdissected epithelial and stromal subpopulations from surgically resected tissue specimens from patients with Gleason 6 (n = 23 specimens from n = 15 patients) and Gleason 9 (n = 15 specimens from n = 15 patients) prostate cancer via quantitative high-resolution liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis. In total, 789 and 295 grade-specific significantly altered proteins were quantified in the tumor epithelium and tumor-involved stroma, respectively. Benign epithelial and stromal populations were not inherently different between Gleason 6 versus Gleason 9 specimens. Notably, 598 proteins were exclusively significantly altered between Gleason 9 (but not Gleason 6) tumor-involved stroma and benign stroma, including several proteins involved in cholesterol biosynthesis and nucleotide metabolism. Proteomic alterations between Gleason 6 versus Gleason 9 were exclusive to the disease microenvironment, observed in both the tumor epithelium and tumor-involved stroma. Further, the molecular alterations measured in the tumor-involved stroma from Gleason 9 cases relative to the benign stroma have unique significance in disease aggressiveness, development, and/or progression. Our data provide supportive evidence of a need for further investigations into targeting stromal reservoirs of cholesterol and/or deoxynucleoside triphosphates in PCa tumors and further highlight the necessity for independent examination of the TME epithelial and stromal compartments."

    "title": "Emerging roles of cuproptosis in liver diseases.",
    "abstract": "Intracellular copper levels should be maintained within a controlled range to obtain copper homeostasis. Cuproptosis, a newly discovered form of cell death, occurs when excessive copper ions bind to the lipoylated enzymes in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, which leads to lipoylated protein aggregation, proteotoxic stress, and ultimately cell death. Herein, we summarize the current knowledge regarding copper metabolism, the discovery and molecular mechanism of cuproptosis. In addition, we discuss the implications of cuproptosis in the pathogenesis of various liver diseases, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), Wilson disease (WD), metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), liver fibrosis, hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury (HIRI) and drug-induced liver injury (DILI). Understanding the mechanism of cuproptosis can not only provide deeper insights into the pathogenesis of liver diseases but also open up new avenues for the development of targeted therapies."

Although widely prevalent, the possible implications of HSV-1 in neurodegenerative diseases, especially dementia and Alzheimer's disease, remain poorly understood. This review seeks to elucidate this association and explore the potential benefits of preventing or treating herpesvirus infections on dementia risk. The goal is to enhance our understanding of HSV-1's potential role in dementia, which could inform the development of future therapeutic interventions for these conditions. PubMed, Embase (Elsevier/Ovid), Web of Science, Scopus, Global Health, PsycInfo, Cochrane Library and Clinicaltrials.gov will be searched from the inception of each respective database. Studies that have HSV-1 as an exposure and dementia, or its subtypes, as a primary outcome will be included. Two researchers will independently screen titles, abstracts and full texts, with discrepancies resolved by a third researcher. Systematic data extraction from eligible studies will be performed using a standardised template. Risk of bias of individual studies will be assessed with the Cochrane Collaboration approach. We will assess the overall quality of cumulative evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations criteria. Statistical analysis will employ a random effects model, and heterogeneity will be determined with Cochrane's Q test and assessed using I<sup>2</sup>. Studies will be grouped by population subgroups and dementia subtypes when possible to explore nuances in results. We will consider performing meta-regression if heterogeneity remains after subgroup analyses. All statistical analyses will be conducted using Stata V.18 software (College Station, Texas, USA). No ethical approval is required since data will be collected from existing studies. The review will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publication and at national and international conferences.

    "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus (DM) is one of the most common diseases worldwide and is a known significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Specifically, DM and stress-induced hyperglycemia (SH) significantly increase morbidity and mortality in trauma patients. It is currently unknown how complication rates compare between trauma patients with SH and DM as well the rate of undiagnosed diabetes in trauma patients. The institutional review board at our institution reviewed and approved the following study. A practice management guideline was established calling for the collection of a hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) on all trauma patients admitted with a blood glucose of >100 mg/dL. A retrospective review was performed on 417 trauma patients and were stratified into two groups: DM (elevated HbA1c with/without elevated SH ratio) or SH (elevated SH ratio only). Statistical analyses were then completed using the following data points: basic demographic data, hospitalization data, and complication rates. A total of 417 patients underwent hemoglobin with A1c testing due to glucose of >100. Of these, 17 were excluded due to normal HbA1c and normal SH ratio. SH patients were noted to be younger, had a lower body mass index, had a lower admission Glasgow Coma Scale, had a higher injury severity score, and were more likely to require operative intervention on arrival (26.8% versus 15.0%; P = 0.01). Patients with DM were more likely to suffer from cardiovascular complications (11.5% versus 4.9%; P = 0.01); however, they suffered similar rates in mortality, hospital length of stay, intensive care unit length of stay, and other complications between the two groups. Of note, we were able to diagnose 19 patients with DM (4.5%) and 42 with pre-DM (10.0%) without a previous history of either disease. SH patients tended to be sicker on arrival but overall suffered similar complication rates compared to patients with DM. Additionally, HbA1c is a feasible tool to screen for occult DM in trauma patients. Future areas of research will focus on implementing a similar practice management guideline for our emergency general surgery service."

    "abstract": "An uncharacterized Rickettsia species was previously identified by molecular detection in Amblyomma americanum ticks from Oklahoma, a state reported to have high Rickettsia seroprevalence. Amblyomma americanum ticks are aggressive feeders capable of transmitting viral, protozoal and bacterial species that cause diseases in humans and animals. Discovering and characterizing novel microorganisms in this tick species is crucial for identifying potential new pathogens. Using A. americanum ticks collected from Oklahoma, we isolated, cultured and sequenced the entire genome of a previously detected, but uncharacterized, novel Rickettsia species. Triturated A. americanum ticks were used as inoculum to culture the novel Rickettsia species in Vero E6 cells, and qPCR testing confirmed the presence of the new Rickettsia species while ruling out the presence of other tick-borne organisms. The total genome size was 1.17 Mbp consisting of a complete chromosome with a 30.7 % G+C content (GenBank accession CP157197). We predicted 1037 genes, 997 coding gene open reading frames, along with 33 tRNAs, 4 ncRNAs and 3 rRNAs. This genome was most similar to Rickettsia canadensis strain CA410 at 91.1 % identity, based on average nucleotide identity analysis. A maximum-likelihood phylogeny tree, constructed using 636 concatenated core proteins, placed the novel Rickettsia species in a clade with Rickettsia canadensis. We propose the name Rickettsia oklahomensis sp. nov., strain Oklahoma 10, which is available from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Rickettsial Isolate Reference Collection (WDCM 1093), Atlanta, GA, USA (CRIRC accession number ROK001)."

    "abstract": "Patients with high-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) are generally treated with transurethral resection of the bladder tumor followed by intravesical bacillus Calmette-GuÃ©rin (BCG), the current standard of care. However, recurrence or progression is common and may result in patients requiring radical cystectomy. Additionally, BCG continues to be in short supply worldwide. Therefore, there is an unmet need for new therapies that provide durable disease control and maintain quality of life. In the BCG-naÃ¯ve high-risk NMIBC setting, potential new treatment options are emerging, with several regimens combining intravesical therapy with systemic PD-1 or PD-L1-directed immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) currently under investigation in several Phase 3 trials. In routine clinical practice, NMIBC has traditionally been managed almost entirely by urologists. However, the introduction of systemic ICIs would likely require medical oncology expertise to help assess patients' fitness for these therapies and potentially for treatment administration and immune-related adverse event management. While multidisciplinary workflows are common practice for advanced bladder cancer, they would represent a paradigm shift in NMIBC. Based on current experience of managing patients with NMIBC across different countries and healthcare systems from our perspective as urologists, medical oncologists, and nurses, we discuss best practices for the potential integration of emerging therapies such as ICIs into the treatment of BCG-naÃ¯ve high-risk NMIBC. We emphasize the need for multidisciplinary care, either through formalized multidisciplinary teams or cross-discipline collaborative workflows adapted to local needs, to ensure efficient coordination and sharing of responsibilities. Specialized nurses have the potential to play key roles across multiple aspects of patient care. We also highlight the crucial importance of effective communication across teams, increases in resourcing, and education for healthcare professionals, patients, and caregivers to enable eligible patients with high-risk NMIBC to benefit optimally from the introduction of these potential new treatment options.

    "abstract": "Duration of protection after respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccination is unknown. This study aimed to evaluate efficacy and safety over three RSV seasons of the AS01<sub>E</sub>-adjuvanted RSV prefusion F protein-based vaccine (RSVPreF3 OA) against RSV-related lower respiratory tract disease (RSV-LRTD) in older adults. In this randomised, observer-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial (AReSVi-006), participants aged 60 years or older in 275 centres (ie, GP practices and clinical research sites) across 17 countries in Africa, Asia, Oceania, Europe, and North America were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive RSVPreF3 OA or placebo before RSV season one. RSVPreF3 OA recipients were re-randomly assigned (1:1) before RSV season two to receive a second RSVPreF3 OA dose (RSV revaccination group) or placebo (RSV single-dose group). Recipients of placebo before RSV season one also received placebo before season two (placebo group). The primary objective (efficacy against first occurrence of RSV-LRTD over one RSV season) was reported previously. Confirmatory secondary objectives were to demonstrate efficacy over three RSV seasons of a single RSVPreF3 OA dose and of a first dose followed by revaccination 1 year later, against RSV-LRTD, overall and by RSV subtype (success criteria: lower limits of two-sided CIs around efficacy estimates >20% [RSV-LRTD] and >0% [RSV-LRTD by RSV subtype]). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04886596, and is complete. Participants were enrolled between May 25, 2021, and Jan 31, 2022. Efficacy analyses included 12 468 RSVPreF3 OA recipients and 12 498 placebo recipients. Cumulative efficacy over three seasons of one RSVPreF3 OA dose was 62Â·9% (97Â·5% CI 46Â·7-74Â·8) against RSV-LRTD, 69Â·8% (42Â·2-85Â·7) against RSV A-related LRTD, and 58Â·6% (35Â·9-74Â·1) against RSV B-related LRTD (median follow-up from day 15 post-dose one 30Â·6 months [IQR 26Â·2-32Â·0]). Efficacy was observed over three seasons among participants aged 60-69 years, participants aged 70-79 years, pre-frail participants (ie, those with a walking speed of 0Â·4-0Â·99 m/s in a gait speed test), and participants with pre-existing conditions that increase the RSV-LRTD risk. Efficacy against RSV-LRTD decreased over time. A first RSVPreF3 OA dose followed by revaccination 1 year later had an efficacy that was within the same range as that of one dose. RSVPreF3 OA showed a clinically acceptable safety profile. Between dose one and trial end, eight (<1%) participants in the RSV single-dose group, 12 (<1%) in the RSV revaccination group, and 12 (<1%) in the placebo group had a serious adverse event considered to be related to the trial intervention by the investigator. Five deaths were assessed as related to the trial intervention by the investigator: three in the vaccine groups (cardiopulmonary failure, cardiac arrest, and left ventricular failure) and two in the placebo group (death of unknown cause and pulmonary embolism). A single RSVPreF3 OA dose was efficacious against RSV-LRTD over three RSV seasons in people aged 60 years or older, despite a decrease in efficacy over time. Further research is needed to establish the optimal revaccination strategy. These results support the favourable benefit-risk profile of RSVPreF3 OA to help protect against RSV-LRTD for at least three RSV seasons. GSK."

While the sequalae of a positive margin related to the primary tumour (R1Tumour) are relatively well known, comparatively less is known when the positive margin pertains to a metastatic lymph node (R1LNM). The aim of this study is to confirm the significance and impact of R1LNM margins in colon cancer patients. A retrospective, observational study of patients treated for American Joint Committee on Cancer Stage 3 colon cancer with potentially curative surgical intervention during a 10-year study period was performed. Patients were stratified into three groups (R0, R1Tumour, R1LNM). Outcomes measured were disease-specific survival (DSS), local recurrence-free survival (LRFS) and systemic recurrence-free survival (SRFS). Cox multivariable analysis and sensitivity analyses (time-stratified, competing-risk and propensity-matched analyses) were performed to determine the independent importance of R1LNM. A total of 801 patients were included. The R1 resection rate was 6.6% and the R1LNM resection rate was 4.7%. Compared with R0 resection, R1LNM margins had significantly lower 5-year DSS [R1LNM 53.8% (95% CI 37.4%-77.3%) vs. R0 74.2%], LRFS [R1LNM 61% (95% CI 41.7%-89.1%) vs. R0 80.5%] and SRFS [R1LNM 39.5% (95% CI 24.2%-63.8%) vs. R0 70%]. R1LNM was not independently associated with the above outcomes following traditional, time-stratified and competing-risk multivariable analyses, nor following propensity matching.

    "title": "Systematic genetic perturbation reveals principles underpinning robustness of the epigenetic regulatory network.",
    "abstract": "The molecular control of epigenetic information relies on hundreds of proteins of diverse function, which cooperate in defining chromatin structure and DNA methylation landscapes. While many individual pathways have been characterized, how different classes of epigenetic regulators interact to build a resilient epigenetic regulatory network (ERN) remains poorly understood. Here, we show that most individual regulators are dispensable for somatic cell fitness, and that robustness emerges from multiple layers of functional cooperation and degeneracy among network components. By disrupting 200 epigenetic regulator genes, individually or in combination, we generated network-wide maps of functional interactions for representative regulators. We found that paralogues represent only a first layer of functional compensation within the ERN, with intra- or inter-class interactions buffering the effects of perturbation in a gene-specific manner: while CREBBP cooperates with multiple acetyltransferases to form a subnetwork that ensures robust chromatin acetylation, ARID1A interacts with regulators from across all functional classes. When combined with oncogene activation, the accumulated epigenetic disorder exposes a synthetic fragility and broadly sensitizes ARID1A-deficient cells to further perturbation. Our findings reveal homeostatic mechanisms through which the ERN sustains somatic cell fitness and uncover how the network remodels as the epigenome is progressively deregulated in disease."

    "abstract": "Vaccine preventable diseases (VPD) present a resurgent threat to global health security and jeopardize decades of advancements in public health and economic development. Since 1974, childhood vaccinations are estimated to have prevented 154 million deaths from VPD, yet recent declines in routine vaccination rates highlight the global population's growing vulnerability to these diseases. When paired with appropriate access to healthcare and trusted information, evidence informed enforceable policies have demonstrably improved childhood vaccination rates in countries that have recently implemented more stringent laws on routine vaccination. Here we comprehensively map and describe the current legal environment for childhood vaccination. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of the childhood vaccination-related policies in 194 countries. Policies were systematically identified, collated, and categorized into a publicly available tool. A total of 106 countries have legally-enforceable policies requiring vaccination for at least one disease. We found that vaccines against diphtheria, measles, and tetanus were the most universally mandated, while vaccines against COVID-19 and Japanese Encephalitis were mandated by the fewest countries. In 91 countries, childhood vaccination requirements are enforced through either legal sanctions, such as monetary fines or incarceration, through exclusion from congregate settings, or through some combination of the two. Analyses of the efficacy of childhood vaccination laws are predicated upon a comprehensive mapping of the current legal landscape related to routine immunization. Public health officials and researchers with an interest in increasing routine childhood vaccination rates in their country must know what characteristics of policy have been effective across various contexts. Our mapping of legally-enforceable childhood vaccination policies is foundational for assessing current vulnerabilities to vaccine-preventable diseases and future policy analyses."

Convention suggests that such autoreactivities are generated during germinal center reactions. Here, we explore earlier immune checkpoints, focusing on patients with contactin-associated protein-like 2 (CASPR2)-autoantibody encephalitis. In both disease and health, high (~0.5%) frequencies of unmutated CASPR2-reactive naÃ¯ve B cells were identified. By contrast, CASPR2-reactive memory B cells were exclusive to patients, and their B cell receptors demonstrated affinity-enhancing somatic mutations with pathogenic effects in neuronal cultures and mice. The unmutated, precursor memory B cell receptors showed a distinctive balance between strong CASPR2 reactivity and very limited binding across the remaining human proteome. Our results identify permissive central tolerance, defective peripheral tolerance, and autoantigen-specific tolerance thresholds in humans as sequential steps that license CASPR2-directed pathology. By leveraging the basic immunobiology, we rationally direct tolerance-restoring approaches, with an experimental paradigm applicable across autoimmunity."

    "title": "Perceived social support and relationship quality predict loneliness in older adults: a social network approach.",
    "abstract": "Loneliness negatively impacts older adults' mental and physical health. Though loneliness is associated with perceived social support, its relationship to received support is unclear. This might be because received support has been defined sparsely, overlooking types of support and overall relationship quality. The current study addressed this gap. Older adults recruited from the community (<i>N</i> = 142) and the Indiana Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC) (<i>N</i> = 176) completed an expanded PhenX social network interview to identify social network size, types of received support (emotional, instrumental), and relationship quality (network closeness, contact frequency). They also completed well-validated measures of loneliness and perceived social support. Data were analyzed with hierarchical linear regressions. In both samples, loneliness was negatively related to perceived social support but was not related to either received support type. Contact frequency predicted loneliness in both samples, but network closeness predicted loneliness in the ADRC sample only. Dementia status did not affect results. Social network size, emotional received support, and instrumental received support were not related to loneliness, but perceived social support and relationship quality were. These findings suggest that loneliness is influenced by perceived social support and some types of received support."

    "abstract": "Wilson's disease (WD) and Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) are rare genetic diseases, and their co-occurrence is even rarer. Here, we describe our experience diagnosing a 6-year-old male Chinese patient presenting with an atypical phenotype and two genetic causative factors who was ultimately diagnosed with coexisting WD and DMD. We used a comprehensive and systematic evaluation of the patient's history, physical examinations, laboratory tests, and genetic testing to make the diagnosis. The patient was treated for one year with therapy to inhibit copper absorption and an anti-inflammatory treatment, and their condition remained stable. This case suggests that the inflammatory response could be a common pathogenesis between these two diseases. It also demonstrates the clinical efficacy of anti-inflammatory therapy for WD with DMD. Furthermore, this case illustrates the importance of taking a detailed history and performing thorough physical examinations to diagnose coexisting hereditary diseases."

    "title": "A computational workflow for assessing drug effects on temporal signaling dynamics reveals robustness in stimulus-specific NFÎºB signaling.",
    "abstract": "Single-cell studies of signal transduction have revealed complex temporal dynamics that determine downstream biological function. For example, the stimulus-specific dynamics of the transcription factor NFÎºB specify stimulus-specific gene expression programs, and loss of specificity leads to disease. Thus, it is intriguing to consider drugs that may restore signaling specificity in disease contexts, or reduce activity but maintain signaling specificity to avoid unwanted side effects. However, while steady-state dose-response relationships have been the focus of pharmacological studies, there are no established methods for quantifying drug impact on stimulus-response signaling dynamics. Here we evaluated how drug treatments affect the stimulus-specificity of NFÎºB activation dynamics and its ability to accurately code ligand identity and dose. Specifically, we simulated the dynamic NFÎºB trajectories in response to 15 stimuli representing various immune threats under treatment of 10 representative drugs across 20 dosage levels. To quantify the effects on coding capacity, we introduced a Stimulus Response Specificity (SRS) score and a stimulus confusion score. We constructed stimulus confusion maps by employing epsilon network clustering in the trajectory space and in various dimensionally reduced spaces: canonical polyadic decomposition (CPD), functional principal component analysis (fPCA), and NFÎºB signaling codons (i.e. established, informative dynamic features). Our results indicated that the SRS score and the stimulus confusion map based on signaling codons are best-suited to quantify stimulus-specific NFÎºB dynamics confusion under pharmacological perturbations. Using these tools we found that temporal coding capacity of the NFÎºB signaling network is generally robust to a variety of pharmacological perturbations, thereby enabling the targeting of stimulus-specific dynamics without causing broad side-effects."

    "title": "Single-cell RNA Sequencing Analysis of Sputum Cell Transcriptomes Reveals Pathways and Communication Networks That Contribute to the Pathogenesis of Asthma.",
    "abstract": "Asthma is driven by complex interactions amongst structural airway cells, cells of the immune system, and the environmental. While sputum cell characterization has been instrumental in studying asthma pathogenesis and refining treatment strategies, the nuances of cellular transcriptomes and intercellular communication in asthmatic sputum remain poorly understood. We employed single-cell RNA sequencing to analyze cells isolated form the sputum from 16 asthma patients and 8 non-asthmatic controls. Cell identities were established using curated marker genes and SingleR annotation. We compared cell-specific gene expression and communication networks between asthmatic and control groups, correlating findings with distinct pathways that were dysregulated in asthma. 37,565 cellular transcriptomes were captured and analyzed. 15 distinct cell populations were identified, including various macrophages, monocytes, dendritic cells, and lymphocytes, along with rare cell types such as mast cells, innate lymphoid cells, bronchial epithelial cells, and eosinophils. Intercellular communication analysis indicated heightened signaling activity in asthma compared to controls, particularly in CD4+ T cells and dendritic cells which exhibited the most significant increases in RNA expression of outgoing signaling molecules. Notably, the ADAM12-SDC4 and CCL22-CCR4 ligand-receptor pathways demonstrated the strongest shifts between asthma and control subjects, particularly between dendritic cells and CD4 lymphocytes. SC RNA seq profiling the asthma cellular transcriptome analysis of sputum highlights both innate and adaptive immune mechanisms that are significantly amplified in asthma. The elevated expression of ADAM12-SCD4 and CCL22-CC4 point to their critical role in asthma pathogenesis, suggesting potential avenues for targeted therapies and improved management of this chronic condition. <b>Evidence Before This Study:</b> Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways driven by intricate interactions between airway structural and immune cells. Previous transcriptomic studies have focused on bulk RNA samples from the airway, leaving significant gaps in our understanding of the cellular dynamics that characterize the disease.<b>Added Value of This Study:</b> This study pioneers the use of single-cell RNA sequencing on sputum samples from patients with asthma, revealing a detailed landscape of cell phenotypes and dynamic communication patterns that distinguish asthmatic individuals from those without the disease. Notably, heightened intercellular communication was observed in asthma, particularly between CD4+ T cells and dendritic cells, confirming that there is a robust network of interactions between immune and structural cells. The notable increase of ADAM12-CCR4 communication from dendritic cells to other cell populations further emphasizes the dysregulation present in asthma.<b>Implications of All Available Evidence:</b> Our transcriptomic profiling illuminates distinct and amplified communication pathways involving CD4+ T cells and dendritic cells, aligning with established paradigms of both adaptive and innate immune responses in asthma pathogenesis. The identification of ADAM12 and CCR4 pathway dysregulation adds a critical layer to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underpinning asthma, paving the way for potential therapeutic targets and personalized treatment strategies. Single cell profiling of the sputum has the capacity to characterize the breadth of cellular phenotypes, their functional status, and the communication in the airway at a level not previously attainable."

    "abstract": "Studies have confirmed that optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) can detect early retinal microvascular impairment in many diseases. However, as far as we know, only one study has found retinal and optic disc microcirculation changes in Wilson's disease (WD) by OCTA. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the OCTA parameters in WD. We performed a cross-sectional study at the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangdong Pharmaceutical University between June 2021 and April 2022. A total of 42 WD patients and 40 gender- and age-matched healthy controls (HEC) were recruited in this study. WD patients were divided into neurological form (NWD) and hepatic form (HWD) of the disease. All participants underwent retinal OCTA to assess the superficial vessel density (VD), deep VD, and foveal avascular zone (FAZ) parameters. The FAZ parameters included the area in mm<sup>2</sup>, perimeter in mm, and VD of the 300 Âµm-width annulus surrounding FAZ (FD-300). Statistical tests used in this study included Chi-squared test, one-way analysis, correlation analysis, and <i>t</i>-test or Mann-Whitney <i>U</i> test. WD patients comprised 21 females and 21 males, with mean age of 30.54Â±9.83 years. HEC comprised 16 females and 24 males, with mean age of 30.42Â±7.37 years. NWD had smaller FD-300 (51.67%Â±5.29% <i>vs.</i> 55.87%Â±3.85%, P<0.01) than HEC and smaller FD-300 (51.67%Â±5.29% <i>vs.</i> 55.42%Â±4.09%, P<0.05) than HWD. There was no significant difference in OCTA parameters between HWD and HEC. Our study indicated that OCTA may be a useful tool for detecting central nervous system (CNS) injury in WD. We speculate that the decrease of FD-300 may be a sign of CNS injury in WD."

All participants underwent both AS-OCT and IVCM, and the results were analyzed using McNemar's test to assess diagnostic concordancet. KF rings were not detected either with AS-OCT or with IVCM in any of the controls. Among the WD patients, seven subjects who did not show KF rings on AS-OCT were found to have them on IVCM (p < 0.05), six of whom were identified diagnosed with hepatic WD. Both AS-OCT and IVCM can provide objective assessment of KF rings. IVCM offers better accuracy compared to AS-OCT, particularly for hepatic WD."

Patients with low disease burden had significantly higher 1-year LFS (0.91 vs. 0.42). Rapid in vivo contraction of CAR T cells after infusion was associated with CAR loss within six months compared to those without rapid contraction (57% vs. 19%, respectively). Most common grade 3/4 adverse events included cytokine release syndrome in 13% and neurotoxicity in 16%. The companion pilot, PLAT-03, enrolled 26 patients, and 19 received T-APCs. Neither cytokine-release syndrome nor neurotoxicity were observed after T-APC infusion. T-APC infusion in patients improved persistence (P=0.03) with rapid CAR T-cell contraction was associated with decreased early CAR loss (20% with T-APC vs. 57% without).

    "abstract": "The 20-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV20) was licensed for prevention of pneumococcal disease in infants and children on the basis of immunogenicity compared with PCV13. We aimed to evaluate PCV20 immunogenicity compared with PCV10 (Synflorix; PhiD-CV) because both vaccines demonstrated lower immunogenicity than PCV13. Nevertheless, PCV10 was highly effective against vaccine-serotype pneumococcal disease in post-licensure studies. Since no study has directly compared PCV20 versus PCV10, we conducted an indirect comparison. We conducted indirect comparisons for PCV20 versus PCV10 using data from published randomized control trials that directly compared these vaccines with PCV13 in 3 + 1 or 2 + 1 schedules. Serotype-specific immunoglobulin (Ig)G concentrations and opsonophagocytic activity (OPA) were assessed post-booster dose and post-primary series. First, geometric mean ratios (GMRs) were obtained for shared serotypes for each direct comparison against PCV13; we conducted a meta-analysis to generate pooled GMRs if data from multiple trials were available. Next, we indirectly compared relative GMRs of PCV20 versus PCV10 using PCV13 as the common comparator. In this descriptive analysis, GMRs > 1 favored PCV20 and GMR < 1 favored PCV10. Meta-analyses of PCV10 versus PCV13 data found that PCV10 was less immunogenic for most of the ten shared serotypes. When indirectly compared via PCV13, the relative immunogenicity of PCV20 versus PCV10 varied by serotype. Overall, IgG responses for the ten shared serotypes were similar for both 3 + 1 and 2 + 1 schedules, both post-primary series and post-booster dose. GMRs for both IgG and OPA were close to the line of equivalence, or spread between favoring PCV20 or PCV10. The comparable immunogenicity of PCV20 versus PCV10 in 2 + 1 and 3 + 1 schedules suggests that PCV20 will have similar effectiveness for the ten serotypes included in both vaccines, including for direct protection during infancy and toddler age, while also expanding serotype coverage. Effectiveness for PCV20 needs to be confirmed in post-marketing studies."

    "abstract": "The incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) is increasing, and with it, the population of individuals requiring post-AKI care. Postdischarge follow-up for AKI survivors is recommended within 90 days of an AKI episode to promote kidney recovery and potentially prevent progression of kidney disease. However, timely postdischarge care is often lacking or fragmented and poses a missed opportunity to prevent long-term complications of this condition. Suggested elements of follow-up care begin with a scheduled appointment with a physician and involve a bundled approach to care with health care providers' communicating across sites, remote patient monitoring devices, review of medications, education, access, kidney care evaluation, and interdisciplinary collaboration to achieve these patient care goals. This article provides an overview of guidance documents for post-AKI care and the roles of the nurse and pharmacist as part of an interdisciplinary team in postdischarge care after a patient incurs an episode of AKI."

    "abstract": "Oncologic patients have significant medical comorbidities which may impact arthrodesis after spine surgery. Furthermore, there is a paucity of published data describing fusion rates, and arthrodesis quality. In this study, we present institutional data for patients with minimum 1-year survival who underwent spinal fusion secondary to treatment of metastatic spine disease. Retrospective cohort study done at a single tertiary medical center. Patients were selected from a single institution between 2012 and 2022. Included patients had spinal fusion as part of oncologic treatment, minimum of 1 year follow up, and postoperative Computed Tomography (CT) scan at minimum 1 year. Patient outcomes included fusion status and Hounsfield units (HU) on CT scan at 1 year. Retrospective chart review was performed collecting demographic and treatment information including postoperative oncologic and radiation treatment as well as HU along the cranial and caudal pedicles bilaterally on the 1-year CT scan. Indications for surgery included symptomatic metastatic disease. All surgeries were performed by 1 of 3 surgeons at a single tertiary medical center. Statistical analysis was performed using the Student T-Test and Chi-Squared Test. There were 74 patients presenting with metastatic spine disease who met inclusion criteria. Demographics included an average age of 61.9 years at time of surgery, median construct length of 6 levels, and median survival was 43.2 months. Our cohort demonstrated complete and partial fusion rates of 11.1% and 59.5%, respectively. There was a significant difference in average HU for patients demonstrating fusion at 1 year, 444.2 compared to those demonstrating a lack of fusion, 285.8 (p<.0001). Patients who received postoperative radiation had higher postoperative HU than those who did not receive radiotherapy (411.1 vs. 304.9, p=.042). There was no significant difference in fusion status based on postoperative chemotherapy status, p=.127. Additionally, there was no difference in HU based on SBRT versus conventional radiotherapy, p=.588. Partial fusion was seen in over half of the study cohort at 1-year follow-up; complete fusion was seen in 11% of patients. Fused patients and those who received postoperative chemotherapy had significantly higher HU on 1-year CT. Maximizing control of cancer burden as well as improving bone quality may help patients with metastatic spine disease demonstrate bony fusion. More research is indicated to evaluate causal implications of survival in patients with metastatic spine disease that have undergone spinal fusion."

    "abstract": "Biallelic loss-of-function mutations in the lipopolysaccharide-responsive and beige-like anchor (LRBA) gene lead to a severe syndrome of early-onset immune dysregulation called LRBA deficiency. Monoallelic CTLA4 mutations lead to a similar phenotype. In both conditions, cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) levels are significantly decreased. In previously reported cases of symptomatic disease associated with LRBA pathogenic variants, patients usually have severely decreased or absent LRBA protein levels. We describe 5 patients with biallelic missense variants in the LRBA gene presenting predominantly with Evans syndrome or colitis. LRBA and CTLA-4 levels were investigated in LRBA missense, \"classic\" LRBA and in CTLA-4 insufficiency samples. Surprisingly, all 5 LRBA missense patients had normal expression of LRBA protein. However, CTLA-4 intracellular expression was reduced to similar levels as those seen in patients with CTLA-4 insufficiency at resting state. Lower levels of surface CTLA-4 are seen on cell activation, indicating that these LRBA variants lead to reduced CTLA-4 cell surface expression. Several of the missense variants are shared between unrelated patients in the cohort, suggesting a mutational hot spot or founder effect for those with shared ancestry. Novel LRBA deficiency variants result in quantitative or qualitative LRBA defects, leading to reduced intracellular resting levels and induced surface levels of CTLA-4."

    "abstract": "Statin therapy is a highly successful and cost-effective strategy for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Adjusting for statin usage is crucial when exploring the association of the lipidome with CVD to avoid erroneous conclusions. However, practical challenges arise in real-world scenarios due to the frequent absence of statin usage information. To address this limitation, we demonstrate that statin usage can be accurately predicted using lipidomic data. Using three large population datasets and a longitudinal clinical study, we show that lipidomic-based statin prediction models exhibit high prediction accuracy in external validation. Furthermore, we introduce a re-weighted model, designed to overcome a ubiquitous limitation of prediction models, namely the need for predictor alignment between training and target data. We demonstrated that the re-weighted models achieved comparable prediction accuracy to ad hoc models which use the aligned predictor between training and target data. This innovation holds promise for significantly enhancing the transferability of statin prediction and other 'omics prediction models, especially in situations where predictor alignment is incomplete. Our statin prediction model now allows for the inclusion of statin usage in lipidomic analyses of cohorts even where statin use is not available, improving the interpretability of the resulting analyses."

This dose escalation/expansion study assessed safety and initial efficacy of the MEK1/2 inhibitor binimetinib with MET inhibitor crizotinib in RASMT advanced CRC patients. In the dose escalation phase, patients with advanced solid tumours received binimetinib with crizotinib, using a rolling- 6 design to determine the maximum tolerable dose (MTD) and safety/tolerability. A subsequent dose expansion in RASMT CRC patients assessed treatment response. Blood samples for pharmacokinetics, MET biomarker and ctDNA analyses, and skin/tumour biopsies for pharmacodynamics, c-MET immunohistochemistry (IHC), MET in situ hybridisation (ISH) and MET DNA-ISH analyses were collected. Twenty patients were recruited in 3 cohorts in the dose escalation. The MTD was binimetinib 30 mg B.D, days 1-21 every 28 days, with crizotinib 250 mg O.D continuously. Dose-limiting toxicities included grade â¥ 3 transaminitis, creatinine phosphokinase increases and fatigue. Thirty-six RASMT metastatic CRC patients were enrolled in the dose expansion.

This expanded scoring system was developed to identify clinically relevant categories and defined criteria for scoring biopsies. In adults (N:483), more severe PI, PP, and DR were associated with older age (p â¤ 0.002), and PP and DR were associated with increased alkaline phosphatase (ALP) (p â¤ 0.003), GGT (p â¤ 0.001), and total bilirubin (p â¤ 0.01).

We assessed the relationship between narcolepsy and subclinical CVD outcomes, including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease/nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using MarketScan Commercial and Medicare Supplemental databases from January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2021. Patients included N=22 293 diagnosed with narcolepsy (NT1 and NT2) and N=63 709 propensity-score-matched without.

Main outcomes were diagnosis of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease/nonalcoholic steatohepatitis following index date, as well as a composite measure for CVD and major adverse cardiovascular events. Compared with propensity-score-matched patients without narcolepsy, patients with narcolepsy had an increased risk for hypertension (hazard ratio [HR], 1.40 [95% CI, 1.34-1.47]), hyperlipidemia (HR, 1.41 [95% CI, 1.35-1.47]), diabetes (HR, 1.50 [95% CI, 1.38-1.64), nonalcoholic fatty liver disease/nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (HR, 1.48 [95% CI, 1.28-1.73]), CVD composite (HR,1.61 [95% CI, 1.35-1.47]), and major adverse cardiovascular events (HR,1.69 [95% CI, 1.43-2.00]). Results remained significant following adjustment for narcolepsy medications including stimulants, wake-promoting agents, and oxybates. Results stratified by age groups showed similar findings, including heightened risk for those <25 years old. Narcolepsy is associated with greater risk of subclinical CVD even in patients as early as childhood. Detection of these outcomes early in the course of narcolepsy could help reduce the burden of adverse cardiovascular events later in life."

Blood investigations demonstrated eosinophilia with elevated lipase, and bronchoscopy demonstrated multiple endobronchial lesions with elevated eosinophils on bronchoalveolar lavage. In addition, labs showed proteinase 3-specific antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (PR3-C-ANCA) autoantibodies, and the patient was diagnosed with EGPA. Additional differential diagnoses of parasitic infection, sarcoidosis, chronic eosinophilic pneumonia, and granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) were entertained, but ultimately, the multisystemic involvement, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody (ANCA) positivity, bronchoscopy, and imaging findings clinched the diagnosis. This case highlights the spectrum of possible EGPA presentations and a rare case of PR3-C-ANCA with gastrointestinal manifestations."

    "title": "Clinical Characteristics, Treatment Effects and Risk Factors of Liver Cirrhosis in Patients with Wilson's Disease Hepatic Type.",
    "abstract": "Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder that can be treated with medications. The lack of a single, specific diagnostic indicator leads to diagnostic difficulties, which may result in disease progression to cirrhosis and even liver cancer. Thus, this study aimed to analyze the clinical data, imaging, histopathological manifestations, genetic testing results, and treatment effects of patients with WD hepatic type, and to explore the factors related to WD cirrhosis. A single-center retrospective study was performed. 48 WD patients with a Leipzig score â¥ 4 were divided into a cirrhosis group and a non-cirrhosis group based on the presence of cirrhosis. Logistic regression analysis and odds ratios were used to describe the strength of association between risk factors and cirrhosis. The predictive value of the model for cirrhosis occurrence was evaluated by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and the cutoff value. All 48 patients diagnosed with WD had liver damage, with males accounting for 54.17%. The median age at diagnosis was 28 years (range: 10.25-40.5 years), and 39.58% of patients had cirrhosis. The most prevalent mutation was c.2333G>T (p.Arg778Leu), found in 41.30% (19/46) of cases. Imaging revealed fatty liver in 31.25% (15/48) of patients and \"honeycomb-like\" cirrhosis nodules in 73.68% (14/19). Compared with the non-cirrhosis group, the cirrhosis group had a higher positive rate for the Kayser-Fleischer (K-F) ring, older age at diagnosis, and higher levels of immunoglobulin G, but lower levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, white blood cells, and platelets (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Age at diagnosis (odds ratio = 1.072, 95% confidence interval = 1.007-1.142, <i>p</i> = 0.03) and the K-F ring (odds ratio = 18.657, 95% confidence interval = 1.451-239.924, <i>p</i> = 0.025) were independent risk factors for WD-related cirrhosis. The best values of area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for age at diagnosis combined with the K-F ring in predicting WD cirrhosis were 0.909. The average follow-up time for 33 patients was 48.6 months (range: 12-72 months). The biochemical recovery rate was over 60% after 12-72 months of treatment with zinc gluconate and/or penicillamine. Age at diagnosis, combined with the K-F ring, is a simple and effective risk factor for WD-related cirrhosis. Zinc gluconate and penicillamine are safe and effective treatments."

    "title": "Extracellular Vesicles Alter Trophoblast Function in Pregnancies Complicated by COVID-19.",
    "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and resulting coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cause placental dysfunction, which increases the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. While abnormal placental pathology resulting from COVID-19 is common, direct infection of the placenta is rare. This suggests that pathophysiology associated with maternal COVID-19, rather than direct placental infection, is responsible for placental dysfunction. We hypothesized that maternal circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs), altered by COVID-19 during pregnancy, contribute to placental dysfunction. To examine this hypothesis, we characterized circulating EVs from pregnancies complicated by COVID-19 and tested their effects on trophoblast cell physiology in vitro. Trophoblast exposure to EVs isolated from patients with an active infection (AI), but not controls, altered key trophoblast functions including hormone production and invasion. Thus, circulating EVs from participants with an AI, both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases, can disrupt vital trophoblast functions. EV cargo differed between participants with COVID-19, depending on the gestational timing of infection, and Controls, which may contribute to the disruption of the placental transcriptome and morphology. Our findings show that COVID-19 can have effects throughout pregnancy on circulating EVs, and circulating EVs are likely to participate in placental dysfunction induced by COVID-19."

    "abstract": "Wilson's disease (WD) liver damage is caused by abnormal copper deposition in the liver. Whether the degree of hepatic impairment correlates with the severity of liver involvement on ultrasound imaging remains unclear. This study aimed to categorize the liver echo patterns of WD according to the B-ultrasound and correlated the degree of hepatic injury with different liver echo patterns based on Transient elastography (TE) and Sound Touch Viscoelastography (STVi). A retrospective study was conducted on 106 WD patients. A consistency analysis was performed on liver stiffness measurement (LSM) through TE and STVi. The liver echo characteristics of all patients were categorized through B-ultrasound, and the differences in LSM<sub>TE</sub>, LSM<sub>STVi</sub>, demographic and anthropometric data, and serological indicators among different patterns were compared. Both TE and STVi measurements exhibited high consistency in intra-observer and inter-observer differences. There were 6 echo patterns in the liver parenchyma of WD, among which \"block-like\" fatty liver and nodule patterns were more characteristic. The 6 types of liver echo patterns were classified into three groups: fatty liver pattern, coarse pattern, and nodule pattern. There was no significant difference in age, gender, and body mass index among the three groups. The comparison results of LSM<sub>TE</sub> and LSM<sub>STVi</sub> among the three groups showed that the coarse pattern was higher than the fatty liver pattern, and there was no significant difference between the nodule pattern and the coarse pattern or the fatty liver pattern. The P III N-P of fatty liver and coarse patterns was higher than that of the nodule pattern. Characteristic ultrasound features of liver parenchyma help us diagnose WD. The degree of liver involvement on imaging may not correspond consistently with the actual level of liver damage. STVi can be used as a reliability method to evaluate the degree of WD liver damage quantitatively, and its other application values in WD are worth further exploration."

    "title": "Longitudinal association between statins and changes in CT-derived body composition in patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm.",
    "abstract": "Loss of skeletal muscle mass and systemic inflammation may offer prognostic value in patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). The longitudinal progression of abnormal body composition parameters and their determinants is poorly reported. Statins are widely used medications that improve the prognosis of cardiovascular disease and interact with both muscle tissue and systemic inflammation. The present study aimed to describe the association between statin therapy and both pre-operative and longitudinal CT-derived body composition in patients undergoing elective intervention for AAA. A total of 756 consecutive patients undergoing elective intervention for AAA at three centres were retrospectively recruited. Body composition analysis was performed on pre-operative and follow-up CTs at L3 to generate subcutaneous adipose tissue index, visceral adipose tissue index and skeletal muscle index and density (SMI and SMD). Systemic inflammation was assessed using the systemic inflammatory grade. A total of 756 patients (702 [93%] males, median [interquartile range, IQR] age 73.0 [11.0] years) were included, with a median (IQR) follow-up of 67.0 (32) months and 235 deaths during the follow-up period. There were 582 patients (77%) receiving statin therapy and 174 patients (23%) not receiving statin therapy. Follow-up CTs were available for 273 patients. From pre-operative to follow-up CTs, there was a decrease in median SMI (P < 0.001) and SMD (P < 0.001) and an increase in the comparative prevalences of low SMI (43% vs. 50%, P < 0.01) and low SMD (64% vs. 88%, P < 0.001). There were no differences in baseline clinicopathological characteristics, systemic inflammation or pre-operative CT-derived body composition parameters between patients with and without >10% loss of skeletal muscle mass. In patients with â¤10% loss of SMI, mean (95% confidence interval) survival was 91.6 (87.2-95.9) months versus 89.3 (80.4-98.2) months in patients with >10% loss of SMI (P = 0.58). Patients receiving statin therapy had a higher American Society of Anesthesiologists grade (P < 0.001), a higher body mass index (BMI) (P < 0.05) and a greater prevalence of normal pre-operative SMI (P < 0.001). In patients with AAA, skeletal muscle mass and density appear to progressively decline despite treatment of AAA, though specific determinants of this are uncertain, and statin use does not appear to predispose to either muscle loss or preservation. Statin therapy appears to be associated with a lower rate of pre-operative low skeletal muscle mass, despite greater comorbidity and BMI. Further investigation of the progressive changes in muscle mass and quality, statin therapy and systemic inflammation is warranted."

    "abstract": "This report details investigations into nine cases of neurological disease and/or sudden death in 8-13-week-old puppies between 2021 and 2024. Aside from two pairs of littermates, cases were unrelated. The puppies had an onset of clinical signs 9-23 days following at least one \"on-label\" dose of a commercially available quadrivalent vaccine containing live attenuated canine distemper virus (CDV). Eight of the nine cases displayed signs typical of \"classic distemper,\" including seizures, circling, tremors, hypersalivation, progressive neurological deficits, pyrexia, and/or respiratory and gastrointestinal signs. Pathological and molecular investigations were undertaken in eight cases. Mononuclear/lymphohistiocytic encephalitis or meningoencephalitis with or without neuronal intranuclear inclusion bodies was present in seven cases. Five cases had bronchopneumonia. Other lesions included poliomyelitis, necrotising enteritis and myocardial necrosis or myocarditis. PCR for CDV was positive on tissues from seven cases, and immunohistochemistry for CDV was positive on neural tissues in six cases. Whole genome sequencing of PCR amplicons demonstrated a Rockborn-like strain with 99.9% homogeneity between samples from four cases and a vial of vaccine. Based on the combination of case history, pathological findings, molecular test results and/or whole genome sequencing, a diagnosis of post-vaccinal canine distemper was confirmed in six cases and presumed in two. Outbreaks of canine distemper have been stemmed by widespread vaccination starting in the mid-twentieth century. Consequently, confirmed cases of natural CDV have not been reported in New Zealand since an outbreak in the 1980s, and CDV is considered a \"notifiable organism\" as per the Biosecurity Act 1993. This is the first case series to report genomic investigation of post-vaccinal canine distemper in New Zealand puppies and highlights a rare adverse event associated with routine vaccination. Our results suggest that puppies with neurological, respiratory and/or gastrointestinal disease with an onset within 6 weeks of vaccination with live attenuated CDV should be reported and investigated accordingly."

    "abstract": "The capacity of host cells to sustain or restrict virus infection is influenced by their proteome. Understanding the compendium of proteins defining cellular permissiveness is key to many questions in fundamental virology. Here, we apply a multi-omic approach to determine the proteins that are associated with highly permissive, intermediate, and hostile cellular states. We observed two groups of differentially regulated genes: (i) with robust changes in mRNA and protein levels and (ii) with protein/RNA discordances. While many of the latter are classified as interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), most exhibit no antiviral effects in overexpression screens. This suggests that IFN-dependent protein changes can be better indicators of antiviral function than mRNA levels. Phosphoproteomics revealed an additional regulatory layer involving non-signaling proteins with altered phosphorylation. Indeed, we confirmed that several permissiveness-associated proteins with changes in abundance or phosphorylation regulate infection fitness. Altogether, our study provides a comprehensive and systematic map of the cellular alterations driving virus susceptibility."

This study identified leadership competencies for managers of individuals with noncommunicable diseases in Iran. The study had three steps: a literature review, an expert panel, and a Delphi technique survey. First, the literature was reviewed to compile a list of leadership competencies in the field of primary health care (public health, NCDs). To refine and adapt the original list of leadership competencies, it was provided to the expert panel in two stages. The list of leadership competencies was sent via email to 30 experts over the course of two Delphi rounds. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the outcomes. Fifteen leadership competencies, comprising multisectoral collaboration, political awareness, evidence-informed decision making, risk and disaster management, planning, innovation, leading and managing change, team building, communication, quality improvement, systematic thinking, management, ethics and professionalism, motivation and inspiration and personality, were identified. The leadership competencies identified in this study can be a helpful tool in evaluating and identifying skills, knowledge, and attitudes with program managers for the prevention and control of NCDs and in designing training programs to strengthen leadership skills."

    "title": "Smoking Cessation Screening and Treatment Among Veterans With Multiple Sclerosis.",
    "abstract": "Cigarette smoking is a leading cause of preventable death in the United States and disproportionately affects veterans. While smoking cessation is the goal for all veterans, it is especially critical for veterans with multiple sclerosis (MS; VwMS), for whom smoking is more detrimental to health and function. Smoking is associated with more MS relapses/flares, greater disability, faster disease progression, and earlier MS-related death. This quality improvement project aims to describe current practice pathways for screening and treating smoking cessation in VwMS and explore whether these differ by sociodemographic factors. A validated algorithm was used to identify VwMS who were current or former smokers at one VA hospital in North Carolina from fiscal year 2020 to 2022 who had been screened for smoking and could be followed for 1 year. A chart review was conducted by 2 reviewers and 25% of charts were audited for reliability. Data extraction was guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research. Within-group proportions were used to help compare receipt of care across different groups in the context of sociodemographic factors. This work was deemed quality improvement and not subject to IRB review. Of all VwMS (n = 309), 39.5% (n = 122) were identified as current or former smokers. Of those, only 58% (n = 71) were eligible largely because many VwMS lacked a current screen, which was an identified gap in care. Among those screened, most screenings had taken place through primary care services (73%), and most were offered behavioral interventions at screening (n = 66), yet few were interested (n = 4) or received a referral to the cessation clinic (n = 2). One additional referral was given during the follow-up year. Most VwMS were also offered pharmacological interventions (n = 68), with more interest (n = 11) and cessation medication prescriptions (n = 8). Eleven additional VwMS received prescriptions throughout the follow-up year, but a third of those (36%) were required due to inpatient hospitalizations. While subgroup sample sizes were limited, potential disparities were noted. For example, women veterans and veterans from minoritized populations were less likely to be assessed for smoking status and offered cessation strategies. This study identified relatively low rates of smoking cessation screening, interest in treatment, and treatment delivery for VwMS. Important racial and sex disparities were noted. There are several potential barriers and facilitators including Electronic Health Record referral logistics, veteran and provider awareness of the relationship between smoking and MS, stigma of behavioral interventions, fragmented care, and competing demands on clinicians. This work was done at one local VA hospital within North Carolina, the leading state in tobacco production, and is not necessarily representative of other hospital screening and treatment practices. The role of specialty providers (e.g., mental health and neurology) in smoking cessation for VwMS should be further explored and may be an important opportunity for improving screenings and tailored discussion. Future work, incorporating VHA clinician and VwMS perspectives, is needed to further characterize and address barriers/facilitators to improve smoking cessation care and health of VwMS."

While classical NEC is strictly associated with prematurity, cardiac NEC is a subset of the disease occurring in infants with comorbid congenital heart disease. Despite similar symptomatology, the NEC subtypes vary slightly in presentation and may represent etiologically distinct diseases. We compared ileal spatial transcriptomes of patients with cardiac and classical NEC. Epithelial and immune cells cluster well by cell-type segment and NEC subtype. Differences in metabolism and immune cell activation functionally differentiate the cell-type makeup of the NEC subtypes. The classical NEC phenotype is defined by dysbiosis-induced inflammatory signaling and metabolic acidosis, while that of cardiac NEC involves reduced angiogenesis and endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced apoptosis. Despite subtype-associated clinical and demographic variability, spatial transcriptomics has substantiated pathway and network differences within immune and epithelial segments between cardiac and classical NEC."

The 20 RNDs included amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease, cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy, congenital myotonia, congenital myasthenic syndrome, Dravet syndrome, Fabry disease, hereditary spastic paraplegia, Huntington disease, Leber hereditary optic neuropathy, mitochondrial encephalopathy (ME), multi-focal motor neuropathy, myotonic dystrophy, primary hereditary dystonia, progressive muscular dystrophy (PMD), spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy, spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), spinocerebellar ataxia, Wilson disease (WD) and X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy. Age were presented as mean and standard deviation while length of hospital stay as median and interquartile range (25th and 75th percentiles). The other variables were described as number and percentage. The data were analyzed by Joinpoint regression. There were 9,351 cases, including 330 ICU and 155 death cases. The average age was 33.7 Â± 22.0 y, and 63.8% of patients were male.

PWH and people without HIV (PWoH) aged 18 years or older, enrolled in the prospective African Cohort Study (AFRICOS) from 2013 to 2016 at multiple sites across Kenya, Nigeria, Tanzania, and Uganda, and underwent clinical evaluation. A neuropsychological battery assessed cognitive performance. Blood samples collected were analyzed by immunoassay. Using multivariable linear regression, we characterized associations between cognitive Z-scores and biomarker levels. Participants included PWoH (17%, n=473), PWH with suppressed viremia (44%, n=1199) and PWH with unsuppressed viremia (exceeding 100 copies/mL, 39%, n=1065). Across groups, PWH with suppressed viremia were significantly older (means=37.1, 41.9 and 37.5, respectively, p<0.001).

Inflammation did not relate to cognitive performance in PWoH. Examining individual neuropsychological test performance, the Grooved Pegboard, measuring psychomotor speed and manual dexterity, displayed the strongest associations with key biomarkers (CCL2 Î²=-0.252, sCD25 Î²=-0.293, and CXCL10 Î²=-0.214, p<0.01).

    "title": "A Wheat Protoplast Assay for Positive Effector Screening and Investigation of Host-Pathogen Interactions.",
    "abstract": "Fungal pathogens present a severe risk to food systems; however, complex crop-microbe interactions are challenging to study using tools developed for model species. In particular, efficient screening and rapid assessment of microbial effectors is hindered by a lack of cloned resistance (R) genes and difficulty in validating large numbers of predicted effector candidates. This chapter describes a protocol for preparing wheat protoplasts to enable positive identification of host defense induction without overexpression of a cloned R gene, increasing the available pool of host resistance genes for screening. The assay uses polyethylene glycol (PEG)-calcium-mediated transient transfection to introduce candidate effector gene constructs into wheat protoplasts, with a defense-activated reporter for inducing a positive readout with internal normalization, indicating host recognition. This protocol provides a valuable tool for the study of host-pathogen interactions in wheat, contributing to improved resources for the development of disease-resistant crops and genome-informed pathogen surveillance."

    "abstract": "Diagnosing Wilson disease (WD) remains challenging. The exchangeable copper (CuEXC) methodology measures the non-ceruloplasmin-bound copper fraction in serum. Relative exchangeable copper (REC), the ratio of CuEXC to total serum copper (Total Cu), has been proposed as a potential diagnostic biomarker. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of these three copper biomarkers in WD. CuEXC and Total Cu levels were measured in newly diagnosed treatment-naÃ¯ve patients with WD (n = 13), treated WD (n = 91), non-Wilsonian hepatic disease (n = 206) and non-Wilsonian acute liver failure (n = 22). REC, CuEXC and Total Cu were compared among groups. Receiver-operating characteristic analyses were performed. Median REC was significantly elevated among patients with WD compared to all other groups combined (23.6% vs. 4.9%, p < 0.001). The opposite was found for Total Cu (3.5 Î¼mol/L vs. 17.2 Î¼mol/L, p < 0.001). In newly diagnosed patients with WD, median REC was significantly higher than in treated patients (29.1% vs. 21.6%, p = 0.008). The optimal diagnostic cut-off value for REC was â¥ 13.8% (sensitivity 100% and specificity 99.6%) for newly diagnosed patients versus those with non-Wilsonian hepatic disease. For Total Cu, the optimal cut-off was â¤ 7.1 Î¼mol/L (sensitivity 61.5% and specificity 99.1%) for newly diagnosed patients with WD versus those with non-Wilsonian hepatic disease. Our data support the diagnostic value of REC in WD. The more broadly available Total Cu also demonstrates a strong diagnostic performance and may be useful in initial work-up. We suggest including REC and/or Total Cu in a future revision of the Leipzig score."

    "abstract": "This study aims to guide the diagnosis and treatment of hepatolenticular degeneration (also named Wilson's disease, WD) and aid multidisciplinary clinicians in making reasonable and personalized treatment regimens. The authors aim to establish a systemic structure for Chinese Multidisciplinary Expert Consensus on Diagnosis and Treatment of Hepatolenticular Degeneration. We collaborated with experts from relevant branches of the Chinese Medical Association and multiple disciplines, along with statistical experts, to formulate this consensus. It is based on advancements in basic and clinical research on Wilson's disease, both domestically and internationally. It mainly consists of clinical manifestations, diagnosis, differential diagnosis, management, and prognosis in the context of Multi-Department treatment (MDT) in China. This Chinese consensus incorporates four decades of institutional experience with thousands of Chinese Wilson's disease (WD) inpatients, as well as decades of international inpatient cases from East to West. It is hoped that this consensus will garner broader attention from clinicians worldwide."

    "abstract": "Invasion of erythrocytes by members of the <i>Plasmodium</i> genus is an essential step of the parasite lifecycle, orchestrated by numerous host-parasite interactions. In <i>P. falciparum</i> Rh5, with PfCyRPA, PfRipr, PfCSS, and PfPTRAMP, forms the essential PCRCR complex which binds basigin on the erythrocyte surface. Rh5 is restricted to <i>P. falciparum</i> and its close relatives; however, PTRAMP, CSS and Ripr orthologs are present across the <i>Plasmodium</i> genus. We investigated PTRAMP, CSS and Ripr orthologs from three species to elucidate common features of the complex. Like <i>P. falciparum,</i> PTRAMP and CSS form a disulfide-linked heterodimer in both <i>P. vivax</i> and <i>P. knowlesi</i> with all three species forming a complex (PCR) with Ripr by binding its C-terminal region. Cross-reactive antibodies targeting the PCR complex differentially inhibit merozoite invasion. Cryo-EM visualization of the <i>P. knowlesi</i> PCR complex confirmed predicted models and revealed a core invasion scaffold in <i>Plasmodium</i> spp. with implications for vaccines targeting multiple species of malaria-causing parasites."

    "abstract": "The invasion of Africa by the Asian urban malaria vector, <i>Anopheles stephensi,</i> endangers 126 million people across a rapidly urbanising continent where malaria is primarily a rural disease. Control of <i>An. stephensi</i> requires greater understanding of its origin, invasion dynamics, and mechanisms of widespread resistance to vector control insecticides. We present a genomic surveillance study of 551 <i>An. stephensi</i> sampled across the invasive and native ranges in Africa and Asia. Our findings support a hypothesis that an initial invasion from Asia to Djibouti seeded separate incursions to Sudan, Ethiopia, and Yemen before spreading inland, aided by favourable temperature, vegetation cover, and human transit conditions. Insecticide resistance in invasive <i>An. stephensi</i> is conferred by detoxification genes introduced from Asia. These findings, and a companion genomic data catalogue, will form the foundation of an evidence base for surveillance and management strategies for <i>An. stephensi</i>."

    "title": "Endoplasmic reticulum stress-autophagy axis is involved in copper-induced ovarian ferroptosis.",
    "abstract": "Copper (Cu) contamination has emerged a global public health problem due to the extensive use of Cu in industrial production and daily life. Reproductive damage resulting from Cu exposure has been particularly evident. Wilson's disease (WD) is a recessive genetic disease characterized by impaired Cu metabolism. Female WD patients have often been associated with reproductive impairment. Ferroptosis, a form of iron-dependent regulated cell death, has been identified as being caused by massive lipid peroxide-mediated membrane damage. However, it remains unclear whether ferroptosis is associated with Cu-induced ovarian damage. In this study, the role of ferroptosis in ovarian damage induced by Cu accumulation and its underlying mechanisms were examined through both in vivo and in vitro experiments. The findings indicated that excessive Cu deposition in the ovaries could lead to follicular atresia and ovulation dysfunction, and trigger ferroptosis in ovarian and granulosa cells (GCs). The mechanism may be related to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress mediated by the protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase (PERK) pathway, and hyperactivation of autophagy. In addition, Cu-induced autophagy in GCs was found to increase intracellular iron levels via the ferritinophagy pathway, thereby inducing ferroptosis. We also found that mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (MitoROS) may be an onstream facilitator of Cu-induced ferroptosis via activation of the ER stress-autophagy pathway. Our findings suggested that ferroptosis is associated with Cu-induced ovarian damage and is regulated by the MitoROS-ER stress-autophagy axes. These results might provide insights for developing treatment for WD and other diseases related to Cu exposure."

    "abstract": "A novel, highly sensitive fluorometric method for D-penicillamine (D-PA) detection has been developed, addressing critical needs in therapeutic drug monitoring. D-PA, a crucial chelating agent used in treating Wilson's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and heavy metal poisoning, requires precise quantification due to its narrow therapeutic window and potential toxicity. The proposed method introduces an innovative sensing platform utilizing red-emissive carbon dots (R@CDs) and cobalt ions, which enables exceptional analytical performance through a sophisticated dual-quenching mechanism. The detection strategy involves cobalt ions initially enhancing the fluorescence of R@CDs. Upon D-PA addition, two synergistic quenching effects occur: competitive displacement of cobalt ions from the carbon dot surface and formation of a yellow-colored D-PA-cobalt complex, inducing an inner filter effect. Comprehensive characterization and mechanistic investigation revealed the intricate molecular interactions governing this detection process. The developed method demonstrated excellent analytical performance, exhibiting excellent linearity (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.9971) and an ultra-low limit of detection of 0.0041 ÂµM. Rigorous validation was conducted through application to rat plasma samples, successfully quantifying D-PA in both healthy and diabetic animal models. Pharmacokinetic analysis unveiled variations in drug disposition between healthy and diabetic rats, highlighting the method's potential for personalized therapeutic monitoring."

    "abstract": "Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by abnormal copper metabolism. Disruptions in copper metabolism lead to excessive copper deposition in the liver, nervous system, kidneys, heart, and other organs, thereby inducing a range of pathological manifestations and clinical symptoms. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has demonstrated significant therapeutic efficacy and excellent safety profiles. When integrated with effective Western anti-copper therapies, it can yield superior therapeutic outcomes. Consequently, TCM has exhibited unique advantages in managing WD, particularly when combined with multiple systemic damages. This paper discusses the pathological mechanisms and TCM etiology and pathogenesis of WD combined with multiple organ damage. It also summarizes the clinical efficacy and mechanism of TCM in treating WD combined with multiple organ damage, aiming to provide a reference for further studies on the role and potential mechanisms of TCM interventions in WD."

The study also sought to investigate how these differences vary in magnitude at different ages. Accelerometry data were analyzed from individuals with dementia (<i>n</i> = 94) and individuals without dementia (<i>n</i> = 613) who participated in the National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS), as well as from individuals with DLB (<i>n</i> = 12) and AD (<i>n</i> = 10) who participated in a pilot study. In the NHATS cohort, individuals without dementia had more activity counts (0.325 million [95% CI 0.162 million, 0.487 million]) and a longer active bout length (0.631 minutes [95% CI 0.311, 0.952]) at the mean age of 79 than individuals with dementia at the same age. There was also suggestive evidence that individuals without dementia had a shorter resting bout length (-2.196 minutes [95% CI -4.996, 0.605]) than individuals with dementia. Differences in data collection and processing prevented direct comparisons between the cohorts, and the parallel analyses in the smaller cohort were underpowered to detect statistically significant differences between DLB and AD. This work shows that objectively measured accelerometry data differ between individuals with and without dementia; future studies with larger samples should investigate whether accelerometry data can be used to aid in the early identification of dementia and differentiation of dementia subtypes."

    "abstract": "Although a direct link between cardiac lymphatics and congenital heart disease (CHD) has not been established, research indicates that abnormalities in the cardiac lymphatic system are involved in several congenital disorders that present with cardiac defects. However, this contribution remains poorly understood and is still an emerging area of study. One theory proposes that abnormal lymphatic development, which can present as cystic hygroma or increased nuchal translucency, may give rise to heart defects such as coarctation of the aorta, hypoplastic left heart syndrome, or bicuspid aortic valves. The genetic pathways for the development of the cardiac lymphatic system and the heart's major vessels may overlap; therefore, mutations in these genes could result in simultaneous defects in both systems. The close anatomical proximity between cardiac lymphatics and the great vessels of the heart suggests a \"cause and effect\" relationship, where an abnormality in one could affect the other and lead to congenital defects. Given that congenital heart disease is the most common birth defect in the United States, this systematic review, following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, seeks to explore the potential link between cardiac lymphatics and CHD. Understanding this connection could have significant clinical implications by paving the way for new diagnostic approaches and therapeutic strategies for CHDs."

    "abstract": "Excessive hydrogen sulfide in the gut, generated by sulfur-metabolising bacteria from foods, has been linked to intestinal inflammation and human diseases. We aim to investigate the interplay between diet and sulphur-metabolising bacteria in relation to mortality and circulating metabolites in understudied populations. In the Southern Community Cohort Study (SCCS), a prospective cohort of primarily low-income American adults, habitual diets were assessed using a food frequency questionnaire at baseline (2002-2009). A sulfur microbial diet score (SMDS) was developed among 514 Black/African American participants by linking habitual dietary intakes with the abundance of sulfur-metabolising bacteria profiled by faecal shotgun metagenomics. The SMDS was then constructed among all eligible SCCS participants (50,114 Black/African American and 23,923 non-Hispanic White adults), and its associations with mortality outcomes were examined by Cox proportional hazards model and Fine-Grey subdistribution hazard model. The association between SMDS and 1110 circulating metabolites was examined by linear regression among 1688 SCCS participants with untargeted metabolomic profiling of baseline plasma samples. Over an average 13.9-year follow-up, SMDS was associated with increased all-cause mortality (HR [95% CI] for the highest vs. lowest quartiles: 1.21 [1.15-1.27]) and cardiovascular disease (1.18 [1.08-1.29]), cancer (1.13 [1.02-1.25]), and gastrointestinal cancer-specific (1.22 [1.00-1.49]) mortality among Black/African American participants (all P-trend<0.05). The associations were largely consistent across participant subgroups. Similar results were observed among non-Hispanic White participants. The SMDS was associated with 112 circulating metabolites, which mediated 36.15% of the SMDS-mortality association (P = 0.002). A dietary pattern promoting sulfur-metabolising gut bacteria may contribute to increased total and disease mortality in low-income American adults.

    "abstract": "Reversing trends in substance use-related health inequities among Indigenous Peoples requires investments in epidemiological research anchored in community-based participatory research (CBPR) methodologies. There is scarce literature that describes how to implement population estimation methods on American Indian reservation lands. This research describes how we leveraged CBPR throughout the implementation of a population estimation study conducted in collaboration with a Tribal Nation in the southern plains to quantify the size and characteristics of persons with histories of illicit substance use on reservation lands. We used the capture and recapture population estimation methodology in April-May 2023 to estimate the size of the population of people who used illicit substances in the past six months in a county within the collaborating tribe's jurisdiction. Participant recruitment occurred in areas where people who use drugs were known to congregate. Participants completed a survey that included measures pertaining to sociodemographics, substance use, harm reduction, overdose, sexual health, and cultural factors. In total, N = 501 surveys were completed by unique persons who had used illicit substances in their lifetime. A large proportion had injected drugs in the past six months or greater than six months ago (19.6% and 31.7%, respectively). There were N = 210 persons who reported having used illicit substances by at least one route of administration within the last six months. We estimated that there were 419 (95% confidence interval = 277, 562) adults who had recently used an illicit substance in the county where the study occurred. This study demonstrates that population estimation methodologies can be integrated with community-based participatory research approaches to quantify the size of populations of people who use drugs. Future work should be conducted to understand the degree to which population-level needs evolve over time and in response to local initiatives."

    "abstract": "Copper (Cu) exists in two oxidation states Cu+I and Cu+II yielding formation of enzymes involved in biological processes. In higher concentrations, by oxidative process and ROS production, Cu is toxic towards plants, humans and animals livers as observed in Wilson disease or sheep scrapie. Fighting according to the Fenton reaction against bacteria and viruses, has been proposed as a mean of combatting nosocomial diseases and complementary to COVID19 vaccination. In humans, Cu is stocked in liver, muscle or bound to brain protein as Ã-APP, tau-protein, Î±-synuclein, ubiquitin or prion which present antioxidant properties when Cu-bonded. In abnormal Ã-sheet conformation, they can trigger neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer(AD), Parkinson(PD) and ALS. In these diseases, blood copper increase correlated with brain copper decrease has been described. In AD, abnormal D-serine has been detected in blood and cerebrospinal fluid. D-glutamate and D-alanine blood levels have been found in AD and could also be controlled with Cu and ceruloplasmin in a possible disease screening test. This abnormal D-conformation might result from epimerization of physiologically L-conformation brain peptides into protease-resistant D-enantiomers. This has previously been experimentally demonstrated for Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy in a free Cu reductive medium with UV-induced free radicals. The Cu brain protective effect against free radicals was restored with cupric addition in oxidizing medium. Cupric supplementation in the brain, might restore Cu protection and slow down neurodegenerative processes. To lower side effects, Cu amino-acid complexes able to cross the blood brain barrier might be suggested for a Cu transfer to the brain."

    "abstract": "Humeral retrotorsion has been studied in youth baseball but is underexplored in other upper-extremity sports. Gymnasts, who often perform repetitive tumbling and overhead weight bearing, are at risk for shoulder pain and impingement. It is unclear if humeral torsional remodeling contributes to these shoulder conditions. The purpose of this study is to compare humeral retrotorsion in the dominant and nondominant arms of female gymnasts vs. nonupper extremity athletes. Data were drawn from a prospective upper extremity ultrasound registry including female gymnasts and nonupper extremity female athletes (soccer players) aged 8-14 years with open physes, presenting between March 2021 and July 2023. Exclusion criteria were prior upper extremity surgery and metabolic bone disease. Bilateral humeral torsion was measured by a fellowship-trained physician using validated ultrasound methods. Analyses included chi-square and Mann-Whitney tests. Forty-five female athletes (31 gymnasts and 14 soccer players) were assessed. Mean age was 10.8 years for gymnasts and 10.9 years for soccer players (<i>P</i> = .755). Most athletes (93.3%) were right-hand dominant. Mean humeral retrotorsion in gymnasts was 76.5Â° (right) and 75.6Â° (left), and 67.9Â° (right) and 70.5Â° (left) in soccer players, with no significant differences in dominant (<i>P</i> = .263) or nondominant arms (<i>P</i> = .228) between groups. Youth gymnasts did not exhibit significant humeral retrotorsion differences compared to controls, suggesting shoulder syndromes in gymnasts may relate more to soft tissue adaptations than bony changes."

    "abstract": "Alpha-gal syndrome (AGS) is a unique allergic condition triggered by IgE antibody production against the mammalian oligosaccharide galactose-Î±-1,3-galactose (Î±-gal). The syndrome, acquired by bites from multiple tick species, leads to delayed allergic reactions after consuming mammalian-derived products containing Î±-gal, including red meat, dairy, and select medications. AGS is especially prevalent in regions with high tick exposure and has become a global public health concern, with rising cases across continents. Despite growing research, including recent findings suggesting that asymptomatic Î±-gal sensitization may contribute to coronary artery disease, the precise immune mechanisms-particularly B cell-mediated IgE production following tick bites-remain poorly understood. Additionally, the tick saliva components that trigger sensitization and the role of the skin-gut axis in food allergy development are knowledge gaps. AGS research has benefited from animal models like mice, zebrafish, and pigs, which replicate key syndrome features, though have limitations. Humanized mouse models and human organoid systems now offer promising tools for investigating AGS pathogenesis and testing potential therapies. This review explores current pre-clinical methodologies, challenges, and the future of AGS research, emphasizing innovative models that may bridge knowledge gaps and advance therapeutic development."

To date, cardiac screening recommendations in football have primarily focused on adult competitive players. Acknowledging its responsibility for player health worldwide, FIFA convened an international working group of cardiology and sports medicine experts to develop cardiac screening recommendations for youth football players. This group performed structured literature reviews and ultimately congregated in January of 2024, when recommendations were presented, scrutinised and judged using a systematic process. The final FIFA recommendations for youth cardiac screening include personal medical history, family medical history, focused physical examination and resting 12-lead electrocardiography.

However, extant studies rarely examined the modifying effects of APOE4 carrier status on the associations between lipids and CD. We analyzed the Chicago Health and Aging Project, a 20-year cohort study comprising older adults with lipid panel assayed, i.e., total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and longitudinal cognitive tests. We ran adjusted linear mixed-effects models, regressing cognitive test composite on each of the four lipids independently, first with the total sample and subsequently using interaction and stratified subgroup analyses, examining the modifying effects of APOE4 carrier status on the associations. 3,496 biracial community-dwelling older adults were recruited from the South side of Chicago (58% African American & 64% women; mean follow-up = 4.6 years). In the total sample, there was a borderline association between TG and CD, estimate (SD, p-value) = 0.0001 (0.0000,0.0565). No associations were detected with other lipids. In the interaction and subgroup analyses, only in Îµ4 carriers that higher TC levels were significantly associated with accelerated CD, -0.020 (0.009,0.035), whereas higher TG levels were significantly associated with decelerated CD, 0.001 (0.001,0.045). No modifying effects of Îµ4 carrier status were detected with other lipids. Specific lipids, i.e., TC and TG, were associated with CD only in the Îµ4 carriers, highlighting the potential importance of measuring APOE4 status to better inform risk prediction and treatment."

We derived a multivariable logistic regression model to predict hospitalization (reflecting frailty) and assessed empagliflozin's riskâbenefit profile in a post hoc analysis of the double-blind, placebo-controlled EMPA-KIDNEY trial. The EMPA-KIDNEY trial randomized 6609 patients with CKD (eGFR â¥20 to <45 ml/min per 1.73 m2, or â¥45 to <90 ml/min per 1.73 m2 with urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio â¥200 mg/g) to receive either empagliflozin 10 mg daily or matching placebo and followed them for 2 years (median). Additional characteristics analyzed in subgroups were multimorbidity, polypharmacy, and health-related quality of life at baseline. Cox regression analyses were performed with subgroups defined by approximate thirds of each variable. The strongest predictors of hospitalization were N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide, poor mobility, and diabetes and then eGFR and other comorbidities. Empagliflozin was generally well tolerated independent of predicted risk of hospitalization. In relative terms, allocation to empagliflozin reduced the risk of the primary outcome of kidney disease progression or cardiovascular death by 28% (hazard ratio, 0.72; 95% confidence interval, 0.64 to 0.82) and all-cause hospitalization by 14% (hazard ratio, 0.86; 95% confidence interval, 0.78 to 0.95), with broadly consistent effects across subgroups of predicted risk of hospitalization, multimorbidity, polypharmacy, or health-related quality of life. In absolute terms, the estimated benefits of empagliflozin were greater in those at highest predicted risk of hospitalization (reflecting frailty) and outweighed potential serious harms. These findings support the use of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors in CKD, irrespective of frailty, multimorbidity, or polypharmacy."

    "abstract": "Overall progress in getting to zero new HIV infections in San Francisco has been made since 2012. However, among people who inject drugs (PWID) there has been no clear downward trend in new HIV infections in recent years. Direct measures of the rate of HIV acquisition and characterization of factors associated with higher rates among PWID are needed to help achieve HIV elimination. This study is a secondary analysis of the National HIV Behavioral Surveillance survey of PWID in San Francisco in 2022. HIV incidence is estimated using age of first injection drug use and date of first HIV-positive test or interview date as the exposure period. Factors associated with HIV seroconversion were identified by Cox regression. Of 518 PWID, 12 newly tested HIV positive in the survey and 38 reported a prior positive test. HIV incidence was calculated as 0.46 per 100 person-years (95% CI 0.35-0.61). HIV incidence rates were significantly higher among PWID who were men who have sex with men (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 15.98, 95% Cl 7.77-32.87, p<0.001), transgender (aHR 8.64, 95% Cl 2.76-27.08, p<0.001), and Hispanic (aHR 2.85, 95% Cl 1.23-6.63, p<0.001). We found a moderate HIV incidence of â¼5 per 1,000 person-years among PWID in San Francisco, with significantly higher rates among sexual, gender, and ethnic minority groups of PWID. Further progress in getting to zero new HIV infections will require more vigorous scale-up of effective prevention interventions, such as PrEP, specifically reaching vulnerable groups of PWID."

The patients with WD-related liver fibrosis were divided into 5 groups according to traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) evidence (dampness-heat syndrome, group A; intermingled phlegm and blood stasis syndrome, group B; liver wind stirring up internally syndrome, group C; yin deficiency of the liver and kidney syndrome, group D; and yang deficiency of the spleen and kidney syndrome, group E) and a group healthy volunteers (group F), which served as the control. Stool samples were obtained from the patients in the 6 groups. The 16S rRNA sequencing technique was used to analyze the intestinal flora of the different TCM evidence groups of WD patients and the healthy control group and subjected to a statistical analysis. The intestinal flora abundance was significantly lower in patients with WD-related liver fibrosis than in healthy controls, and the decrease in strain content was more significant in patients with deficiency evidence in groups D and E. In terms of the structure of the phylum-level flora, the Firmicutes phylum was still the dominant phylum, but the contents of the evidence-type groups all decreased, with the most obvious decreases in groups D and E. The results for the Actinobacteria phylum were similar, whereas the opposite was true for the Proteobacteria phylum. The section-level and genus-level results corresponded to the gate level. The intestinal flora of the WD-related liver fibrosis patients and healthy controls differed in terms of abundance and intestinal flora structure, and there were also differences between different Chinese medicine certificates."

Invasive <i>Group B Streptococcus</i> disease (iGBS) is a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality worldwide. Little is known about the short and long-term risk of common mental disorders in birthing parents whose infants had iGBS in the first 89 days after birth. We aimed to examine the risk of depression and anxiety in birthing parents with iGBS-affected infants in a cohort study with prospectively collected data from Danish registries. Using Danish healthcare registries from 1997 to 2018, we obtained data on iGBS-affected children and their birthing parents. A comparison cohort was randomly sampled (1:50) through risk-set sampling, and matched on persons' age, year of childÂ´s birth, and parity. The risk of using antidepressant medicines and depression or anxiety diagnosis was analyzed with cumulative incidence function and in Cox proportional hazards regression models.

During a median follow-up of 9â9 years, the cumulative incidence of antidepressants use among birthing parents with iGBS-affected children was 31% (95% confidence interval, CI: 28-34%), as compared with 29% (95% CI: 28-30%) among members of the comparison cohort (hazard ratio 1â12 [95% CI: 1â01-1â25]). A 16% increase in the rate of diagnosed depression or anxiety was observed in the overall follow-up period. Our findings provide evidence of a slightly increased risk of antidepressant use and diagnosed depression or anxiety in parents who gave birth to children with a history of iGBS compared to a matched cohort of birthing parents whose infants did not develop iGBS. Our findings highlight the importance of addressing the mental health needs of birthing parents affected by their children' iGBS."

    "title": "Patient- and Community-Level Characteristics Associated With Respiratory Syncytial Virus Vaccination.",
    "abstract": "In 2023, the first respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccines were recommended for US adults 60 years or older, but few data are available about which patients were most likely to receive vaccine to inform future RSV vaccine outreach efforts. To assess patient- and community-level characteristics associated with RSV vaccine receipt and patient knowledge and attitudes related to RSV disease and RSV vaccines. During the first season of RSV vaccine use from October 1, 2023, to April 30, 2024, adults 60 years or older hospitalized with RSV-negative acute respiratory illness were enrolled in this cross-sectional study from 26 hospitals in 20 US states. Sociodemographic and clinical data were abstracted from health records, and structured interviews were conducted for knowledge and attitudes about RSV disease and RSV vaccines. Age, sex, race and ethnicity, pulmonary disease, immunocompromised status, long-term care facility residence, medical insurance, social vulnerability index (SVI), and educational level. The exposures were identified a priori as possible factors associated with RSV vaccine receipt and were entered into a modified Poisson regression model accounting for state clustering, to assess for association with RSV vaccine receipt. Knowledge and attitudes were summarized with frequencies and proportions. Among 6746 hospitalized adults 60 years or older, median age was 73 (IQR, 66-80) years and 3451 (51.2%) were female. Among the 6599 patients with self-reported race and ethnicity, 699 (10.6%) were Hispanic, 1288 (19.5%) were non-Hispanic Black, 4299 (65.1%) were non-Hispanic White, and 313 (4.7%) were other race or ethnicity. There were 700 RSV-vaccinated (10.4%) and 6046 unvaccinated (89.6%) adults. Among 3219 unvaccinated adults who responded to RSV knowledge questions, 1519 (47.2%) had not heard of RSV or were unsure; 2525 of 3218 (78.5%) were unsure if they were eligible for RSV vaccine or thought they were not. In adjusted analyses, characteristics associated with RSV vaccination were being 75 years or older (adjusted risk ratio [ARR], 1.23; 95% CI, 1.10-1.38, P < .001), being male (ARR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.01-1.30; P = .04), and having pulmonary disease (ARR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.16-1.67; P < .001), immunocompromised status (ARR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.14-1.48; P < .001), low (ARR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.18-1.83, P < .001) or moderate (ARR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.21-1.79; P < .001) SVI, and educational level consisting of 4 or more years of college (ARR, 2.91; 95% CI, 2.14-3.96; P < .001), at least some college or technical training (ARR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.35-2.53; P < .001), or grade 12 education or General Educational Development (ARR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.03-2.00; P = .03). RSV vaccination was less likely among residents of long-term care facilities, patients with Medicaid coverage, and uninsured patients. In this cross-sectional study of hospitalized adults, knowledge of RSV disease and RSV vaccine eligibility was low. Older adults and those with certain medical conditions were more likely to have received vaccine, suggesting appropriate prioritization, but sociodemographic differences in vaccine uptake occurred."

The effects of add-on sotatercept in patients with advanced pulmonary arterial hypertension and a high risk of death are unclear. In this phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (WHO functional class III or IV) and a high 1-year risk of death (Registry to Evaluate Early and Long-Term Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Disease Management Lite 2 risk score, â¥9) who were receiving the maximum tolerated dose of background therapy to receive add-on sotatercept (starting dose, 0.3 mg per kilogram of body weight; escalated to target dose, 0.7 mg per kilogram) or placebo every 3 weeks. The primary end point was a composite of death from any cause, lung transplantation, or hospitalization (â¥24 hours) for worsening pulmonary arterial hypertension, assessed in a time-to-first-event analysis. A total of 172 patients were included (86 each in the sotatercept and placebo groups). The trial was stopped early on the basis of the efficacy results of a prespecified interim analysis. At least one primary end-point event occurred in 15 patients (17.4%) in the sotatercept group and in 47 patients (54.7%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.24; 95% confidence interval, 0.13 to 0.43; P<0.001). Death from any cause occurred in 7 patients (8.1%) in the sotatercept group and in 13 patients (15.1%) in the placebo group; lung transplantation in 1 patient (1.2%) and 6 patients (7.0%), respectively; and hospitalization for worsening pulmonary arterial hypertension in 8 patients (9.3%) and 43 patients (50.0%). The most common adverse events with sotatercept were epistaxis and telangiectasia. Among high-risk adults with pulmonary arterial hypertension who were receiving the maximum tolerated dose of background therapy, treatment with sotatercept resulted in a lower risk of a composite of death from any cause, lung transplantation, or hospitalization (â¥24 hours) for worsening pulmonary arterial hypertension than placebo.

    "abstract": "To date, the focus of investigation in pediatric pulmonary embolism (PE) has been on PE recurrence and anticoagulant-related bleeding. While highly relevant, these outcomes do not fully capture functional limitations and the psychological impact that comprises post-PE syndrome. The primary objective of the Functional Characterization of Venous Thromboembolic Disease (FUVID) study was to investigate mechanisms of post-PE syndrome in children. The ongoing FUVID study will prospectively enroll and systematically follow, over 12 months and with standardized pulmonary, cardiac, and muscle testing, a multicenter prospective cohort of 80 pediatric patients with first-episode PE without comorbidities. FUVID has 2 coprimary outcomes: exercise intolerance and exertional dyspnea. Exercise intolerance will be defined objectively as a percent predicted peak oxygen uptake based on ideal body weight or milliliters per minute per kilogram of lean body mass during cardiopulmonary exercise testing. Dyspnea will be objectively quantified using Borg questionnaires and defined as a mean difference of >1 at the end of the warm-up and submaximal work rates during exercise testing, simulating conditions during daily life that induce dyspnea. Pertinent secondary outcomes include anxiety, depression, and quality of life. The FUVID study will investigate the relationship between symptoms (exercise intolerance and exertional dyspnea) and multiple mechanisms-hemodynamic, ventilatory, or peripheral/muscle-within the same patient at rest, submaximal exercise (simulating activities of daily living), and maximal exercise using objective measures. It will provide new evidence for selecting patients for long-term follow-up, including psychological sequelae, after PE, the modalities this follow-up should include, and the findings interpreted as indicating functional limitations after PE."

    "title": "A cerebrospinal fluid synaptic protein biomarker for prediction of cognitive resilience versus decline in Alzheimer's disease.",
    "abstract": "Rates of cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD) are extremely heterogeneous. Although biomarkers for amyloid-beta (AÎ²) and tau proteins, the hallmark AD pathologies, have improved pathology-based diagnosis, they explain only 20-40% of the variance in AD-related cognitive impairment (CI). To discover novel biomarkers of CI in AD, we performed cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteomics on 3,397 individuals from six major prospective AD case-control cohorts. Synapse proteins emerged as the strongest correlates of CI, independent of AÎ² and tau. Using machine learning, we derived the CSF YWHAG:NPTX2 synapse protein ratio, which explained 27% of the variance in CI beyond CSF pTau<sub>181</sub>:AÎ²<sub>42</sub>, 11% beyond tau positron emission tomography, and 28% beyond CSF neurofilament, growth-associated protein 43 and neurogranin in AÎ²<sup>+</sup> and phosphorylated tau<sup>+</sup> (A+T<sub>1</sub>+) individuals. CSF YWHAG:NPTX2 also increased with normal aging and 20 years before estimated symptom onset in carriers of autosomal dominant AD mutations. Regarding cognitive prognosis, CSF YWHAG:NPTX2 predicted conversion from A+T<sub>1</sub>+ cognitively normal to mild cognitive impairment (standard deviation increase hazard ratio = 3.0, P = 7.0 Ã 10<sup>-4</sup>) and A+T<sub>1</sub>+ mild cognitive impairment to dementia (standard deviation increase hazard ratio = 2.2, P = 8.2 Ã 10<sup>-16</sup>) over a 15-year follow-up, adjusting for CSF pTau<sub>181</sub>:AÎ²<sub>42</sub>, CSF neurofilament, CSF neurogranin, CSF growth-associated protein 43, age, APOE4 and sex. We also developed a plasma proteomic signature of CI, which we evaluated in 13,401 samples, which partly recapitulated CSF YWHAG:NPTX2. Overall, our findings underscore CSF YWHAG:NPTX2 as a robust prognostic biomarker for cognitive resilience versus AD onset and progression, highlight the potential of plasma proteomics in replacing CSF measurement and further implicate synapse dysfunction as a core driver of AD dementia."

    "abstract": "The effects of metabolic syndrome (MetS), its individual components, and baseline liver histology, on the rates of progression and regression of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), were evaluated. We conducted a post hoc analysis of a multicenter prospective cohort study using the noninterventional registry of the Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis Clinical Research Network (2002-2022). We included patients aged 18 years or older with biopsy-proven NAFLD. Outcomes included progression/regression of histology defined by changes in NAFLD Activity Score, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, or fibrosis. Crude incidence rates were compared among patients with MetS vs those without using Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank test. Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate effects of MetS and its components on the fibrosis progression/regression. We included 452 patients; the mean age was 51 years, one-third was male, and 85% was White. The median follow-up was 4.3 (range: 1-15.6) years. At baseline, patients with MetS, large waist circumference, and impaired glucose tolerance/diabetes had worse ballooning and fibrosis scores and a higher prevalence of definite nonalcoholic steatohepatitis than those without. MetS was not associated with fibrosis progression or regression. Impaired glucose tolerance/diabetes was associated with a higher risk of fibrosis progression (adjusted hazard ratio = 1.61; 95% confidence interval: 1.11-2.34) whereas hypertension was associated with a lower risk (adjusted hazard ratio = 0.64; 95% confidence interval: 0.43-0.96). In the cohort of patients with NAFLD, MetS was associated with greater histological severity at baseline but was not a risk factor of disease progression or regression. Impaired glucose/diabetes was associated with a higher rate and hypertension with a lower rate of fibrosis progression."

    "title": "Gut <i>Akkerm</i>ansia enhances liver protection and facilitates copper removal during D-penicillamine treatment in a Wilson's disease model.",
    "abstract": "Patients afflicted with Wilson's disease (WD) may encounter hepatic and extraneous manifestations due to the progressive accumulation of copper in the liver and other subsequent organs. Copper-chelating agents, such as D-penicillamine (DPA), are commonly utilized in the medical treatment of copper overload in WD. Manipulating the composition of gut microbiota appropriately can enhance drug efficacy and safety. This study aims to investigate how targeted intervention on gut microbiota influences the effectiveness of copper removal in a WD model during DPA treatment. First, following a 4-week treatment of DPA, the liver copper concentration and gut microbial composition were assessed in the WD mice model to identify potential candidates for targeted regulation of gut microbiota. Second, after 8 weeks of manipulating the gut microbiota during DPA treatment, various parameters including blood liver function indicators, tissue copper load, hepatic histopathological features, and gut microbiota were investigated in WD mice. The findings demonstrated that the presence of <i>Akkermansia</i> significantly enhances the efficacy of DPA, leading to a more efficient elimination of copper from tissues and a greater improvement in liver injury, liver dysfunction, and gut dysbiosis. In contrast, <i>Butyricimonas</i> has an antagonistic effect. The results of gene function prediction analysis indicated that the altered gut microbial function by DPA and Akk is primarily linked to energy generation/utilization, amino acid, fatty acid, lipid, and nucleic acid metabolisms. To summarize, this study provides experimental evidence for the potential application of targeted regulation of gut microbiota in the adjunctive therapy of copper dysregulation disease.IMPORTANCECopper is an essential element in virtually all living organisms. Wilson's disease (WD) is a representative disorder caused by the disruption of copper homeostasis. Oral-chelating agents are the first-line treatment for copper-overloaded diseases, with D-penicillamine (DPA) being the prototypical drug. However, the efficacy and adverse effects of DPA remain challenging in its use for WD treatment. In our study, the supplementation of <i>Akkermansia muciniphila</i> (Akk), a key gut microbe, along with DPA was demonstrated to enhance copper removal, ameliorate liver injury and dysfunction, and restore gut dysbiosis in a mouse model of WD. These findings highlight the significant potential applications of targeted modulation of gut microbiota as \"pharmacomicrobiomics\" in adjunctive therapy for disorders involving copper dysregulation."

This study aimed to describe admission characteristics that predict failed medical management and to evaluate a previously developed risk score for predicting the need for surgical intervention in cases of TOA. Single centre, retrospective cohort study. Patients admitted to a tertiary-level public teaching hospital with a radiologically or surgically proven TOA between January 1, 2012 and December 31, 2018. Demographic and clinical details were obtained from electronic clinical records. Medical treatment was considered \"failed\" when surgical intervention was required beyond 24 h of antibiotics. Multivariable analyses using logistic regression was used to determine predictors of failed medical management. Risk scores were calculated as per Fouks et al. and a receiver operating characteristic curve was constructed to assess correlation with outcomes. There were 425 patients and 522 admissions with TOA. In the first 24 h, 14% (72/522) of admissions were treated with a surgical intervention in addition to intravenous (IV) antibiotics, while 86% (450/522) were treated with IV antibiotics alone. In those treated with IV antibiotics alone, medical treatment was successful in 65% (293/450) of cases, with 35% (159/450) requiring additional surgical or radiological intervention prior to discharge. Variables independently associated with failed medical treatment were fever at admission (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.72, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.11-2.67), larger mean diameter of TOA (2% higher odds for every 1-mm increase in abscess size) and higher C-reactive protein value (1% higher odds for every unit increase) at admission. The area under the curve (95% CI) for Fouks et al. scoring system was 0.63 (0.58-0.68), indicating poor discriminatory ability. A third of TOAs managed medically required surgical intervention. Fever, higher inflammatory markers, and larger mass were predictive of requiring surgery. However, a scoring system using these variables had poor discriminatory ability to predict treatment failure. Prospective studies are needed to determine whether earlier recourse to surgery can improve outcomes."

    "abstract": "Non-contrast CT calcium scoring (CTCS) exams have been widely used to assess coronary artery disease. However, their clinical applications in predicting coronary arterial remodeling remain unknown. This study aimed to develop a novel machine learning model to predict positive remodeling (PR) from CTCS scans and evaluate its clinical value in predicting major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). We analyzed data from 1,324 patients who underwent both CTCS and CT angiography. PR was defined as an outer vessel diameter at least 10% greater than the average diameter of the segments immediately proximal and distal to the plaque. We utilized a total of 246 features, including 23 clinical features, 12 Agatston score-derived features, and 211 epicardial fat-omics features to predict PR. Feature selection was performed using Elastic Net logistic regression, and the selected features were used to train a CatBoost machine learning model. Classification performance was evaluated using 1,000 repetitions of five-fold cross-validation and survival analyses, comparing actual and predicted PR in the context of predicting MACE. PR was identified in 429 patients (32.4%). Using Elastic Net, we identified the top 13 features, including four clinical features, three Agatston score-derived features, and six fat-omics features. Our method demonstrated excellent classification performance for predicting PR, achieving a sensitivity of 80.3 Â± 1.7%, a specificity of 89.7 Â± 1.7%, and accuracy of 81.9 Â± 2.5%. The Agatston-score-derived and fat-omics features provided additional benefits, improving classification performance. Furthermore, our model effectively predicted MACE, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 4.5 [95% confidence interval (CI): 3.2-6.4; C-index: 0.578; <i>p</i> < 0.00001] in the training set and an HR of 3.2 (95% CI: 2.5-4.0; C-index: 0.647; <i>p</i> < 0.00001) in the external validation set. We developed an innovative machine learning model to predict coronary arterial remodeling from epicardial fat and calcification features from low-cost/no-cost screening CTCS scans. Our results suggest that vast number of CTCS scans can support more informed clinical decision-making and potentially reduce the need for invasive and costly testing for low-risk patients."

The SA Ministry of Health (MOH) has initiated several programs and policies to enhance QUM including a National Medication Safety Program, national clinical guidelines, and technology-based strategies. To assess the published literature on the range, quality, and effectiveness of QUM methods in the SA health system. Comprehensive search of electronic databases Scopus, Medline, and PubMed for papers reporting evaluation of QUM interventions or programs in SA. QUM programs involving medication reconciliation, interventions by hospital pharmacists, antibiotics stewardship, technology and staff training are the most commonly used programs reported in SA. Evaluations of several QUM interventions found a significant positive impact on health outcomes, prescribing patterns, chronic disease management, medication safety, and healthcare costs. Medication reconciliation programs reduced discrepancies by up to 20% in some studies. Hospital pharmacist interventions showed high acceptance rates (up to 92%) and improved medication safety. Antibiotic stewardship programs effectively reduced antimicrobial use and costs. Health information technology implementations like electronic health records (EHR), and computerized physician order entry (CPOE) showed mixed results but generally improved medication safety and efficiency. Staff training initiatives enhanced healthcare professionals' knowledge and skills in medication management. While SA has national QUM policies and programs, and evidence that individual QUM interventions have significant positive local impact, more large-scale, multi-center studies are needed to provide a comprehensive view of QUM practices. More rigorous evaluations of existing programs and expansion of the range of QUM programs to align with international ones could further improve medication safety and patient outcomes in Saudi Arabia."

    "title": "Challenges and Recent Advances in Diagnosing Wilson Disease.",
    "abstract": "Wilson disease (WD) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by ATP7B gene mutations, leading to pathological copper accumulation that primarily affects the liver, brain, and eyes. Diagnosing WD remains a significant challenge due to its highly variable clinical presentation, which ranges from asymptomatic biochemical abnormalities to acute liver failure and severe neuropsychiatric manifestations. Traditional diagnostic markers, such as serum ceruloplasmin, urinary copper excretion, and liver biopsy, lack sufficient specificity and sensitivity, often leading to delays in diagnosis and misclassification. Additionally, the absence of a single gold-standard test and the overlap with other hepatic and neurological disorders further complicate early detection. Recent advances in diagnostic techniques offer promising solutions to overcome these limitations. Novel biomarkers, including relative exchangeable copper (REC) and ATP7B protein quantification in dried blood spots have demonstrated improved accuracy in distinguishing WD from other conditions. Advanced imaging modalities, such as anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT), quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM), and copper-64 positron emission tomography imaging provide noninvasive tools for detecting early disease-related changes. Furthermore, next-generation sequencing (NGS) enhances genetic screening, facilitating earlier diagnosis, and family screening. A comprehensive approach integrating conventional and emerging diagnostic methodologies is essential for improving early detection and patient outcomes. Greater awareness of the limitations of traditional tests and the incorporation of novel biomarkers and imaging techniques into clinical practice can help refine diagnostic accuracy, reduce delays, and optimize treatment strategies for WD."

The average T<sub>1Ï</sub> relaxation time in the weight-bearing articular cartilage was calculated, and we tested the interacting effects of age and participant group (LCPD vs non-LCPD) or subgroup (control, contralateral LCPD, spherical LCPD, and aspherical LCPD) on T<sub>1Ï</sub> using mixed effects models. The main effect of age on T<sub>1Ï</sub> relaxation time in hips without LCPD deformity was -0.63 âms/year (95 â% confidence interval [-0.94, -0.32]). The age-adjusted main effect of LCPD deformity was +2.93 âms [0.65, 3.42] and the interaction effect of age and LCPD deformity was +0.46 âms/year [0.16, 0.76]. Moderate differences were observed between control and contralateral LCPD subgroups, and between spherical LCPD and aspherical LCPD subgroups. Age-related changes in T<sub>1Ï</sub> relaxation time differ between hips with and without LCPD deformity, suggesting that cartilage degradation in LCPD is progressive and begins early in the healed stage of LCPD. By young adulthood, the difference in T<sub>1Ï</sub> between LCPD and non-LCPD hips is clinically important when considering osteoarthritis progression and outcomes."

    "abstract": "In adolescents and adults with complex congenital heart disease (CHD), abnormal cortical folding is a putative predictor of poor neurodevelopmental outcome. However, it is unknown when this relationship first emerges. We test the hypothesis that it begins in utero, when the brain starts to gyrify and folding patterns first become established. We carried out a prospective, longitudinal case-control study, acquiring foetal MRIs at two timepoints in utero, (Scan 1 = 20-30 Gestational Weeks (GW) and Scan 2 = 30-39 GW), then followed up participants at two years of age to assess neurodevelopmental outcomes. We used normative modelling to chart growth trajectories of surface features across 60 cortical regions in a control population (n = 157), then quantified the deviance of each foetus with CHD (n = 135) and explored the association with neurodevelopmental outcomes at two years of age. Differences in cortical development between CHD and Control foetuses only emerged after 30 GW, and lower regional cortical surface area growth was correlated with poorer neurodevelopmental outcomes at two years of age in the CHD group. This work highlights the third trimester specifically as a critical period in brain development for foetuses with CHD, where the reduced surface area expansion in specific cortical regions becomes consequential in later life, and predictive of neurodevelopmental outcome in toddlerhood.

The multimammate rat is the main animal reservoir and its geographic range is expected to expand due to influences like climate change and land usage, and this will place larger parts of Africa at risk. We conducted preclinical development on a promising experimental vaccine that allowed its advancement into human trials. The LF vaccine is based on a vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) vector in which the VSV glycoprotein (G) was replaced with the LASV glycoprotein complex (GPC). Earlier studies showed that this vaccine (VSVÎG-LASV-GPC) was efficacious in macaques, thus we regenerated VSVÎG-LASV-GPC using laboratory and documentation practices required to support vaccine manufacturing and human trials. The efficacy of the clinical vaccine candidate was assessed in cynomolgus macaques and more extensive immunologic analysis was performed than previously to investigate immune responses associated with protection. A single VSVÎG-LASV-GPC vaccination elicited innate, humoural and cellular immune responses, prevented development of substantial LASV viraemia, and protected animals from disease. Vaccinated macaques developed polyfunctional antibodies and serum was shown to neutralize virus expressing GPCs representative of geographically diverse LASV lineages. The VSVÎG-LASV-GPC clinical candidate elicited immunity that protected 10 of 10 vaccinated macaques from disease supporting its use in a clinical development program, which recently progressed to phase 2 clinical trials. Moreover, immunologic analysis showed that virus-neutralizing serum antibodies likely played a role in preventing LASV disease in vaccinated macaques.

    "abstract": "Analysis of functional connectivity can provide insights into how the brain performs various cognitive and behavioral tasks as well as the neural mechanisms underlying several pathologies. In this work, we describe a novel approach to estimate functional connectivity from electroencephalography (EEG) data using the concept of coherence potentials (CPs), which are defined as clusters of high-amplitude deflections with similar waveform shapes. We define connectivity measures based on features of CPs, including the time intervals between CP peaks and their co-occurrence on different electrodes or channels. We used EEG data from 25 healthy subjects performing three tasks - resting state (eyes closed and eyes open), working memory and pattern completion tasks to investigate the ability of CP based connectivity measures to distinguish between these tasks. When compared with traditional connectivity measures including several spectral-based measures and mutual information, our results showed that CP based connectivity measures more robustly and significantly distinguished between all the tasks both at group-level and subject-level. In conclusion, CP based EEG connectivity measures provide a reliable way to distinguish between different cognitive task conditions and could pave way in the early detection of neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease that affect various cognitive tasks."

    "title": "Severe neck pain among patients with degenerative cervical myelopathy: an observational study from the Canadian Spine Outcomes and Research Network.",
    "abstract": "Degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) is the most common cause of spinal cord dysfunction in adults. While surgical intervention is widely recognized as the primary treatment to halt disease progression and improve neurological function, its effectiveness in alleviating neck pain remains poorly understood. The aims of this study were to identify DCM patients that presented with severe neck pain and to compare their baseline characteristics and surgical outcomes to those who presented with less severe neck pain. This is a prospective, multicenter observational cohort study of the Canadian Spine Outcomes and Research Network (CSORN). Patients surgically treated for DCM between 2015 and 2022 were enrolled. Baseline demographics, clinical/surgical details, PROs and mJOA were assessed. Baseline demographics, clinical/ surgical details, preoperative PROs and mJOA were compared between the patients with severe patient-rated neck pain (NP, defined as NRS-NP â¥ 8), and those with less severe NP. Between group improvements at 12 months were assessed using ANCOVA to adjust for any baseline significant differences between groups. We included data from 725 DCM patients, 31.7 % (n=230) of whom presented with severe NP. Patients with severe NP were significantly more likely to be younger, smokers, unemployed, working rather than retired, unmarried, using pain medication, have a history of depression, have more comorbidities, and be physically less active (all p<.05). Baseline PROs (NRS AP and NP, NDI, SF-12 MCS and PCS and EQ5D) were significantly worse (p<.01), but mJOA scores were similar to those without severe NP. Among patients with severe NP, mean NRS-NP improved from 8.6 (SD 0.8) to 3.9 (SD 2.9, p<.01) at 12 months after surgery. Patients with severe NP were more likely to achieve MCID for neck pain in comparison to those without severe NP (74% vs. 33%, p<.01), but mean NRS-NP remained worse in this subgroup (3.9 vs. 2.6, p<.01) at 1 year after surgery. When adjusted for baseline characteristics, there were no differences between the 2 groups for the following PROs at 12 months postoperatively: NRS arm pain, NDI, SF-12 PCS, EQ5D. SF-12 MCS remained significantly worse among patients who presented with severe NP (p<.05). There was no significant difference in mJOA scores (report data) at 1 year after surgery. Severe neck pain affects about a third of the DCM population. Most patients who presented with severe neck pain experienced substantial improvement of their neck pain after surgery. Except for mental health scores which remained worse, patients with severe neck pain experienced similar improvements in other outcome measures such as neurological function and health-related quality of life when compared to those with less severe neck pain. These findings suggest that surgical treatment not only addresses the structural causes of DCM but also provides meaningful improvements across multiple domains, underscoring its value in managing both the physical and psychosocial burdens of the disease."

    "title": "Adolescents with Osteochondritis Dissecans of the Femoral Condyle Present with High Rates of Corresponding Coronal Malalignment.",
    "abstract": "Osteochondritis dissecans of the knee (KOCD) may be a source of pain in active, skeletally immature patients. An association between the condylar lesion location and lower-extremity coronal plane malalignment has been established, but clinical implications have been poorly understood. This study aimed to confirm the high rate of malalignment in KOCD and variation in demographic characteristics, presentation features, and disease severity between those with and without malalignment. Prospectively collected clinical, demographic, and radiographic data were obtained, and standard standing alignment measurements were evaluated from an institutional KOCD cohort. Alignment was defined as whether the mechanical axis passed between the condyles (neutral), the lateral femoral condyle (valgus), or the medial femoral condyle (varus). Comparative analysis was performed between KOCD lesions in each condyle presenting with or without malalignment. The Fisher exact test or chi-square test was used to analyze categorical variables, and the t test or Mann-Whitney U test was used to analyze continuous variables. This study examined 187 knees (156 patients, with a mean age of 12.9 years, 36.4% female); 66.3% had medial femoral condyle (MFC) lesions. Malalignment was found in 47.6% of all KOCD cases and 45.9% of skeletally immature cases. Twenty-nine (23.4%) of 124 MFC KOCD cases were in varus knees, and 42 (66.7%) of 63 lateral femoral condyle (LFC) KOCD cases were in valgus knees. MFC KOCD cases that presented in varus knees were more likely in Black or African American patients (p = 0.008) and had a larger lesion size, with a coronal width of 16.6 mm compared with MFC KOCD cases not in varus knees at 14.1 mm (p = 0.008). Similar differences were found in LFC KOCD cases presenting in valgus knees, which represented nearly all LFC KOCD cases in Black or African American patients (91.7%; p = 0.05) and had a larger lesion size, with a sagittal width of 20.8 mm compared with 16.4 mm for LFC KOCD cases not in valgus knees (p = 0.006). Nearly one-half of knees with KOCD in skeletally immature patients may be in coronal malalignment and, thus, candidates for guided growth. Malalignment corresponding to the involved compartment was common and was present in two-thirds of lateral lesions. When malalignment placed the weight-bearing axis within the involved compartment, lesions were larger and more advanced. Thus, consideration should be given to addressing malalignment found during evaluations. Prognostic Level III . See Instructions for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence."

    "abstract": "In vineyards, downy mildew of grapes, caused by the oomycete pathogen <i>Plasmopara viticola</i>, can cause significant economic losses when left unmanaged. <i>P. viticola</i> is a species complex, made up of at least four clades, or cryptic species, causing disease on at least eight plant species within the family Vitaceae. In the United States, clades <i>aestivalis</i>, <i>riparia</i>, and <i>vinifera</i>, have been identified, as being present in the Great Lakes region on cultivated grapes. Within this study, a multiplexed TaqMan qPCR assay system capable of differentiating among these three taxa was developed using a mitochondrial gene order difference unique to <i>Plasmopara</i> species (cox1-atp1). The assay is needed to clearly differentiate among the closely related species as research investigates relationships between the clades and their varying hosts as well as fungicide resistance development. The multiplexed assay was validated using a panel of target and non-target samples of varying types, including leaves, ToughSpot stickers, and air sampling rods. The assay was also transferred to and optimized on a digital PCR (dPCR) platform. Air sampling rods and artificially inoculated mixed samples were tested using both qPCR and the dPCR assays to gauge utility of each. The multiplexed assays for each clade showed varying sensitivity of 10 to 1,000 fg of DNA and efficiency of 70-85% in qPCR. The dPCR sensitivity was the same, except for clade riparia, which showed a potential tenfold increase in sensitivity. These results suggest that the dPCR can serve as a more sensitive option than qPCR when trying to diagnose plant pathogens, but it is dependent on the assay. This assay system provides detection of the pathogen and classification of P. viticola clades allowing discrimination in areas growing multiple cultivated or wild grape species. This will continue to be relevant as wild hosts can potentially harbor different P. viticola clades and downy mildew is intensely managed in commercial vineyards."

    "abstract": "<i>Streptococcus equi</i> subsp. <i>equi</i> causes the equine respiratory disease 'strangles', which is highly contagious, debilitating and costly to the equine industry. <i>S. equi</i> emerged from the ancestral <i>Streptococcus equi</i> subsp. <i>zooepidemicus</i> and continues to evolve and disseminate globally. Previous work has shown that there was a global population replacement around the beginning of the twentieth century, obscuring the early genetic events in this emergence. Here, we have used large-scale genomic analysis of <i>S. equi</i> and its ancestor <i>S. zooepidemicus</i> to identify evolutionary events, leading to the successful expansion of <i>S. equi</i>. One thousand two hundred one whole-genome sequences of <i>S. equi</i> were recovered from clinical samples or from data available in public databases. Seventy-four whole-genome sequences representative of the diversity of <i>S. zooepidemicus</i> were used to compare the gene content and examine the evolutionary emergence of <i>S. equi</i>. A dated Bayesian phylogeny was constructed, and ancestral state reconstruction was used to determine the order and timing of gene gain and loss events between the different species and between different <i>S. equi</i> lineages. Additionally, a newly developed framework was used to investigate the fitness of different <i>S. equi</i> lineages. We identified a novel <i>S. equi</i> lineage, comprising isolates from donkeys in Chinese farms, which diverged nearly 300 years ago, after the emergence of <i>S. equi</i> from <i>S. zooepidemicus</i>, but before the global sweep. Ancestral state reconstruction demonstrated that phage-encoded virulence factors <i>slaA</i>, <i>seeL</i> and <i>seeM</i> were acquired by the global <i>S. equi</i> after the divergence of the basal donkey lineage. We identified the equibactin locus in both <i>S. equi</i> populations, but not <i>S. zooepidemicus</i>, reinforcing its role as a key <i>S. equi</i> virulence mechanism involved in its initial emergence. Evidence of a further population sweep beginning in the early 2000s was detected in the UK. This clade now accounts for more than 80% of identified UK cases since 2016. Several sub-lineages demonstrated increased fitness, within which we identified the acquisition of a new, fifth prophage containing additional toxin genes. We definitively show that acquisition of the equibactin locus was a major determinant in <i>S. equi</i> becoming an equid-exclusive pathogen, but that other virulence factors were fixed by the population sweep at the beginning of the twentieth century. Evidence of a secondary population sweep in the UK and acquisition of further advantageous genes implies that <i>S. equi</i> is continuing to adapt, and therefore, continued investigations are required to determine further risks to the equine industry."

    "abstract": "Wilson's disease is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by impaired hepatic copper transport, leading to copper accumulation in tissues and diverse clinical manifestations. A 27-year-old male chemical factory worker presented with acute haemolytic anaemia, pancytopenia, jaundice, and altered sensorium, indicative of acute liver failure. Despite normal serum ceruloplasmin levels, elevated 24-hour urinary copper levels (227.53 Âµg/24 hours) supported the diagnosis of probable Wilson's disease. The patient responded to symptomatic management, including transfusions and antibiotics, with gradual clinical and biochemical improvement before discharge against medical advice. This case underscores the diagnostic challenges of Wilson's disease due to nonspecific symptoms and limitations of laboratory tests. It highlights the importance of clinical suspicion and a multidisciplinary approach to ensure accurate diagnosis and timely treatment."

A cross-sectional study was conducted between May and August 2020 through telephone surveys with cisgender and trans women enrolled in two cohort studies in Rio de Janeiro. We assessed IPV employing the Revised Conflict Tactics Scale during the initial months of shelter-in-place ordinances. Regression models evaluated the factors associated with IPV for each population. We surveyed 796 women, and 341 participants (47.78%) were eligible and included in the current analysis. All cisgender women and 41 (64.06%) trans women were living with HIV. Overall IPV prevalence was 27.86% (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 23.34-32.88). IPV was 63% higher among trans women than among cisgender women (prevalence ratio 1.63, 95% CI 1.14-2.34, <i>p</i>=0.008). Loneliness was significantly associated with IPV in both groups. Younger age and binge drinking were associated with IPV prevalence among trans women. For cisgender women, IPV was associated with withdrawal of cash transfer programs during the shelter-in-place. Trans women experienced significantly more IPV than cisgender women in the early phase of the COVID-19 epidemic. Plans to prevent and address violence against cisgender and trans women, especially those with heightened vulnerability that may be associated with living with HIV, are needed in public health planning for future pandemics."

    "abstract": "In order to better understand the dynamics governing the formation of pathological oligomers leading to Alzheimer's disease (AD) in a rat model the present study examined the protein aggregates accumulating on gold colloids in the hippocampus. Sections of the hippocampus of the Long Evans Cohen's AD(+) rat model were mixed with gold colloids and the resulting aggregates were examined by Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) imaging. Compared to AD(-) rat tissues, the AD(+) rat hippocampal tissues produced a larger sized gold colloid aggregates. The SERS spectrum of each hippocampal section exhibited similar spectral patterns in the Amide I, II, and III band regions, but showed distinct spectral patterns in the region between 300 cm<sup>-1</sup> - 1250 cm<sup>-1</sup> in AD(+) rat tissues, respectively. Amyloid fibrils with a Î²-sheet conformation were previously reported to form gold colloid aggregates in mouse and human AD brain tissues. The gold colloid aggregates in the AD (+) rat hippocampal brain sections showed distinct morphological traits compared to those observed in AD(-) rats. This suggests that there is a spatial distribution of oligomer concentration in the hippocampus, which induces fibril formation to disrupt neuronal networks within the hippocampus and between other parts of the brain."

    "abstract": "Synapses represent a fundamental unit of information transfer during cognition via presynaptic vesicle exocytosis. It has been established that evoked release is probabilistic, but the mechanisms behind spontaneous release are less clear. Understanding spontaneous release is vital, as it plays a key role in maintaining synaptic connections. We propose a model framework for spontaneous release where the reserve pool geometrically constrains recycling pool vesicles, creating an entropic force that drives spontaneous release rate. We experimentally support this framework using SEM, fluorescence microscopy, computational modeling, and pharmacological approaches. Our model correctly predicts the spontaneous release rate as a function of presynapse size. Finally, we use our approach to show how Î²-amyloid mutations linked to Alzheimer's disease lead to increased spontaneous release rates. These results indicate that synapses regulate the density of the recycling pool to control the spontaneous release rate and may serve as an early indicator of Alzheimer's disease."

    "abstract": "Abnormalities of choroidal blood flow in the eye are associated with occurrence of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Cocoa flavanols show beneficial effects on vascular risk factors in small and short-term trials and may help reduce AMD risk. To examine whether daily supplementation with cocoa extract, a source of flavanols, prevents the development or progression of AMD. This was a prespecified ancillary study of the COSMOS (COcoa Supplement and Multivitamins Outcomes Study) trial, a double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2 Ã 2 factorial randomized clinical trial of a cocoa extract supplement and a multivitamin supplement in the prevention of cardiovascular disease and cancer among 21 442 US adults, including 12 666 women aged 65 years and older and 8776 men aged 60 years and older. The intervention phase was performed from June 2015 through December 2020; data analysis was completed in August 2024. Cocoa extract supplement (500 mg/day cocoa flavanols, including 80 mg (-)-epicatechin) or placebo. The primary end point was a composite of incident cases of AMD plus cases of progression to advanced AMD (geographic atrophy, neovascular membrane, retinal pigment epithelium detachment, or disciform scar) among participants with AMD at baseline, based on self-report confirmed by medical record review. Mean (SD) participant age was 72.1 (6.6) years, and 12 666 participants (59.1%) were female. During a median (IQR) period of 3.6 (3.2-4.2) years of treatment and follow-up, 344 participants (1.6%) experienced a confirmed AMD event (316 incident AMD, 28 progression to advanced AMD). For the primary composite end point, there were 159 cases (1.5%) in the cocoa extract group and 185 cases (1.7%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.87; 95% CI, 0.71-1.08; P = .21). Separate Cox models fitted because of evidence of nonproportional hazards (P = .048) indicated a 23% decreased risk in the cocoa extract group during the first 2 years of treatment (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.59-1.01), with no added benefit for treatment beyond 2 years (HR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.76-1.50). Similar time-dependent findings were observed for the secondary trial outcomes of incident visually significant AMD and advanced AMD. In this ancillary study of the COSMOS randomized clinical trial, cocoa extract supplementation for a median period of 3.6 years among older women and men had no effect overall on occurrence of AMD. However, a possible modest treatment effect early in the trial could not be ruled out, which warrants further investigation to clarify whether cocoa extract may help reduce AMD risk.

    "abstract": "Pathological accumulation of tau (pTau) contributes to various tauopathies, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), and correlates with cognitive decline. A rapid surge in tau-targeted approaches via anti-sense oligonucleotides, active/passive immunotherapies suggests that targeting p-Tau is a viable strategy against tauopathies. We describe a multi-species validation of our previously described QÃ virus-like particle (VLP)-based vaccine technology targeting phosphorylated tau on threonine 181 (pT181-QÃ). Two vaccine doses of pT181-QÃ, without any adjuvants, elicited robust antibody responses in two different mouse models of tauopathy (PS19 and hTau) and rhesus macaques. In mouse models, vaccination reduced AT180+ hyperphosphorylated, Sarkosyl insoluble, Gallyas silver positive tau, inflammasomes/neuroinflammation, and improved recognition memory and motor function without inducing adverse T-cell activation. Anti-pT181 antibodies are reactive to pTau in human AD brains, engage pT181+ tau in human brain lysates, and are central nervous system bioavailable. Our results suggest the translational utility of pT181-QÃ against tauopathies. Icosahedral display of phosphorylated tau at threonine 181 (pT181) QÃ virus-like particle surface (\"pT181-QÃ\" vaccine) induces a robust immune response in mice and in non-human primates (NHPs) pT181-QÃ vaccination reduces pathological tau (pTau) and brain atrophy, and improves memory and motor function in PS19 and hTau mice. pT181-QÃ vaccination-induced immunoglobulin Gs (IgGs) are safe, Th2 skewed (anti-inflammatory), specific to pTau in human AD brain, and efficiently engage pT181 in NHPs and human brain lysate. pT181<sup>+</sup> tau in human plasma correlates with the neurofilament light in subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI)-suggesting the presence of pT181-QÃ vaccine target in the early disease state."

    "abstract": "Concomitant abdominal organ transplant of the liver, kidney, and/or pancreas with lung transplant (Con-AbLTx) may be considered for appropriate patients who present with end-stage disease of multiple organ systems. Most existing literature examines outcomes of combined lung-liver transplants, with little attention paid to other commonly transplanted abdominal organs, such as kidneys and pancreas. This study aims to examine post-transplant outcomes of patients submitted to Con-AbLTx to lung transplant (LTx)-only recipients. The international society for heart and lung transplantation (ISHLT) International Thoracic Organ Transplant Registry for Con-AbLTx and LTx-only was reviewed from January 1994 to June 2018. LTx-only recipients were propensity score matched 4:1 based on various patient characteristics. Data were analyzed with Fisher's exact, Wilcoxon rank sum tests, Kaplan-Meier methods, and Cox proportional hazards where appropriate. A total of 195 Con-AbLTx and 780 propensity-matched LTx-only cases were compared. LTx-only recipients demonstrated higher levels of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome. Following transplant, Con-AbLTx required a longer hospital stay and post-transplant dialysis before discharge. LTx-only were more likely to experience graft failure from acute rejection or chronic rejection. Con-AbLTx experienced higher 1-year mortality than LTx-only counterparts, with the highest mortality seen in the concomitant lung/kidney group. Of concomitant transplants, lung/liver recipients had greater survival over time. Con-AbLTx has the potential to carry substantial morbidity. At 10 years post-transplant, there is no statistically significant difference in survival between LTx-only and Con-AbLTx recipients. Given limited organ availability and ethical considerations of simultaneous transplant, careful consideration for Con-AbLTx is paramount to achieve acceptable outcomes."

    "abstract": "Wilson's disease (WD) and Alexander's disease (AxD) are two prevalent genetic illnesses in clinical practice. However, cases of concurrent WD and AxD have not been reported. A mutation in the ATP7B gene causes improper copper metabolism, whereas AxD is caused by a mutation in the GFAP gene, which causes glial fibrillary acidic protein to accumulate in astrocytes. We present the first instance of concurrent WD and AxD in order to increase the diagnosis accuracy of this type of disease and provide a more precise treatment plan for the patient. A 10-year-old girl who appeared with diminished speech, limb weakness, trouble walking, and mental behavioral problems within the last 2 months. The patient's copper biochemistry results and clinical manifestations supported the diagnosis of WD, however her uncommon bilateral frontal lobe cerebral white matter with considerable high signal in MRI differed from the normal neuroimaging presentations of WD. To clarify the patient's diagnosis, we did whole-exome sequencing testing. To further clarify the patient's diagnosis, we performed whole exome sequencing tests on the patient and her father and detected a single heterozygous mutation in the GFAP gene and a double heterozygous mutation in the ATP7B gene, with the two variant loci located on the same allele. Combined with the Leipzig score and characteristic MRI changes, the patient was diagnosed with co-morbid WD and AxD. The overlapping presentation of the two diseases on MRI suggests the importance of clinicians recognizing the features of both diseases. A comprehensive diagnostic strategy including genetic testing, neuroimaging, and detailed clinical evaluation is required."

    "title": "Practical and Multidisciplinary Review on Wilson Disease: The Portuguese Perspective.",
    "abstract": "Wilson disease (WD) is a genetic disorder of copper metabolism caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene resulting in toxic copper accumulation in several organs. WD can manifest as liver disease, a progressive neurological disorder, a psychiatric illness, or a combination of these. Other clinical manifestations can also occur. Diagnosis is challenging and typically requires a range of biochemical tests, imaging, genetic testing for ATP7B, and/or liver biopsy. WD is treatable with chelating agents, such as d-penicillamine and trientine, and/or zinc salts alongside with dietary copper restriction. Liver transplantation may be indicated in WD patients with severe hepatic disease, and cautiously considered in patients with neurological WD. Treatment success highly depends on patient adherence and treatment persistence. Therefore, effective interventions for improving patient adherence and close monitoring are key for preventing WD progression. In Portugal, there are no reference centers for WD, and patients are dispersed across numerous medical specialists. This review aimed to summarize the most recent and relevant information for the diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of WD in Portugal, as well as possible interventions for stimulating adherence to treatment."

In this dose-escalation phase I trial, patients with advanced solid tumours received PD-0325901 with crizotinib, using a rolling-6 design to determine the maximum tolerable dose (MTD) and safety/tolerability. Blood samples for pharmacokinetics and skin biopsies were collected. Twenty-five patients were recruited in 4 cohorts up to doses of crizotinib 200 mg B.D continuously with PD-0325901 8 mg B.D, days 1-21 every 28 days. One in six patients exhibited a dose-limiting toxicity at this dose level. Drug-related adverse events were in keeping with single-agent toxicity profiles. The best clinical response was stable disease in seven patients (29%). PD-0325901/crizotinib can be given together at pharmacologically-active doses.

Here we analyzed hundreds of cellular and molecular features in the context of discrete pulmonary phenotypes to define the systemic immune landscape of post-COVID lung disease. Cluster analysis of lung physiology measures highlighted two phenotypes of restrictive lung disease that differed according to their impaired diffusion and severity of fibrosis. Machine learning revealed marked CCR5<sup>+</sup>CD95<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell perturbations in milder lung disease but attenuated T cell responses hallmarked by elevated CXCL13 in more severe disease. Distinct sets of cells, mediators and autoantibodies distinguished each restrictive phenotype and differed from those of patients without substantial lung involvement. These differences were reflected in divergent T cell-based type 1 networks according to the severity of lung disease. Our findings, which provide an immunological basis for active lung injury versus advanced disease after COVID-19, might offer new targets for treatment."

    "abstract": "Wilson disease (WD) is a potentially fatal metabolic disorder caused by the inactivation of the copper (Cu) transporter ATP7B, resulting in systemic Cu overload and fibroinflammatory liver disease. The molecular mechanism and effects of elevated Cu on cytoskeletal dynamics in liver fibrogenesis are not clear. Here, we tested the regulation of hepatic cytoskeleton and fibrogenesis with respect to Cu overload in WD. Atp7b<sup>-/-</sup> (knockout) mice with established liver disease, hepatocyte-specific Atp7bâ³<sup>Hep</sup> knockout mice without fibroinflammatory disease, and the age-and sex-matched controls were compared using Western blotting, real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR), immunohistochemical (IHC) staining and transcriptomics (RNA-sequencing) analysis. In Atp7b<sup>-/-</sup> mice with developed liver disease, there is a significant increase in cytoskeletal protein expression with a reduction in Î±-tubulin acetylation. In these mice before the onset of liver pathology, no significant changes in cytoskeletal nor hepatic stellate cell activation are observed. As hepatic copper levels rise, an increase in cytoskeletal proteins with a decrease in acetylated-Î±-tubulin/Î±-tubulin ratio occurs. RNA-sequencing, qRT-PCR, and immunostaining confirm that the tubulin is upregulated at the transcriptional level and hepatocytes are the primary source of early tubulin increases before fibrosis. An increase in Î±-tubulin with a decrease in Î±-tubulin acetylation via Hdac6 and Sirt2 induction facilitates fibrosis as reflected by concomitant increases in desmin and Î±-SMA immunostaining in Atp7b<sup>-/-</sup> mice at 20 weeks. Moreover, strongly positive correlations between Î±-tubulin and Î±-tubulin deacetylase with the expression of liver fibrosis markers are observed in animal and human WD. Hepatocyte-specific Atp7bâ³<sup>Hep</sup> mice lack significant changes in tubulin as well as fibrosis despite hepatic steatosis. This study provides evidence that microtubule destabilization causes cytoskeletal rearrangement and facilitates hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation and fibrosis in the murine model of WD. KEY MESSAGES: Hepatic cytoskeleton system is induced in Wilson disease. Hepatic microtubules acetylation is dysregulated in murine Wilson disease. Microtubules destabilization is positively associated with liver fibrosis in Wilson disease. Microtubules destabilization concomitant with fibrogenesis exacerbates WD progression."

Previous studies link CIH to fibrosis, inflammation, and hormonal dysregulation across various tissues. Yet, the effect of CIH in the cornea is unknown. Moreover, women and men diagnosed with OSA present with diverse symptoms, suggesting sex-specific pathophysiology at play. Thus, we used a rat model to assess the impact of CIH and sex on protein expression of corneal fibrotic markers (Î±-SMA, COL III, cFN, TSP-1), proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1 Î±, IL-17, IL-18, and IFN-Î³), and hormone receptors (ERÎ±, ERÎ², GPER, GnRH-R, and LH-R). Male and female Sprague Dawley rats were exposed to normoxic or CIH conditions during their sleep cycle for 14 days. Extracted corneal proteins were subjected to Western blot and multiplex magnetic bead analysis. Our results reveal sex differences in fibrotic and inflammatory markers in the cornea, whereby female corneas exhibit higher levels of fibrotic markers, while male corneas exhibit increased inflammatory cytokines. CIH exposure resulted in elevated levels of Î±-SMA and pro-inflammatory cytokines in female corneas, while there was no impact on fibrotic or inflammatory markers in male corneas. Additionally, CIH exposure reduced hormone receptors in male and female corneas in a sex-dependent manner. Correlation analyses identified associations of corneal hormone receptors with corneal fibrotic and pro-inflammatory markers that were dependent on sex, with female corneas demonstrating stronger correlations compared to male corneas. Altogether, our data suggests hormone-mediated signaling may contribute to CIH-mediated corneal fibrosis and inflammatory phenotypes, especially in females."

    "title": "Thyroid Disorders as a Risk Factor for Neurodegenerative Proteinopathies: A Large-Scale Propensity Score-Matched Analysis.",
    "abstract": "The relationship between thyroid disorders and neurodegenerative diseases remains poorly understood. This large-scale retrospective cohort study aimed to investigate the association between thyroid disorders and various neurodegenerative diseases, as well as the potential impact of thyroidectomy. We analyzed data from 3,719,666 patients with thyroid disorders and 2,945,438 controls from 120 healthcare organizations (TriNetX database). After propensity score matching, each group included 2,033,096 patients. We compared the risk of neurodegenerative diseases between these groups and examined the effect of thyroidectomy in a subgroup analysis of 31,753 matched pairs. Patients with thyroid disorders showed significantly higher risks of Alzheimer's disease (RR = 1.15, 95% CI: 1.110-1.195), Parkinson's disease (RR = 1.25, 95% CI: 1.187-1.318), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (RR = 1.35, 95% CI: 1.131-1.622), frontotemporal dementia (RR = 1.44, 95% CI: 1.219-1.702), Lewy body dementia (RR = 1.15, 95% CI: 1.107-1.186), progressive supranuclear palsy (RR = 1.41, 95% CI: 1.095-1.819), vascular dementia (RR = 1.32, 95% CI: 1.266-1.369), Niemann-Pick disease type C (RR = 1.34, 95% CI: 1.092-1.638), and Wilson's disease (RR = 1.26, 95% CI: 1.056-1.507). Interestingly, the risk of multiple sclerosis was lower (RR = 0.80, 95% CI: 0.738-0.862). Thyroidectomy was associated with a 44.2% lower risk of Lewy body dementia (RR = 0.558, 95% CI: 0.339-0.919, p = 0.020). Thyroid disorders are significantly associated with an increased risk of several neurodegenerative diseases. Thyroidectomy may have a protective effect against Lewy body dementia. These findings suggest a complex relationship between thyroid function and neurodegeneration, emphasizing the need for neurological monitoring in patients with thyroid disorders and further research into thyroid-brain interactions."

    "title": "The caregiver burden of idiopathic inflammatory myopathies.",
    "abstract": "The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to determine the prevalence of caregiver burden (CB) in caregivers of patients with idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM). An anonymous survey was distributed worldwide to caregivers of myositis patients through Myositis Support and Understanding in May 2022. CB was measured using the Zarit Burden Interview. The survey also gathered caregiver demographic, financial, and insurance information as well as patient demographic and disease information. Overall, 75.8% of caregivers had at least mild to moderate CB. 39.2% reported not being affected financially by their caregiving responsibilities. A positive effect was found between CB and time since diagnosis, disability level, and financial hardship. A negative effect was found with CB and caregiver age. No association was found between IIM type and CB. CB is a common experience among caregivers of all types of IIM patients. Future research can use our results to generate viable hypothesis about CB in myositis. They should also seek to further understand what contributed to CB in this population. Clinicians should also be attuned to the needs of caregivers tending to long-term myositis patients, especially caregivers of more disabled patients, older caregivers, and individuals financially challenged by caregiving."

    "title": "Comparison of Medicare claims-based <i>Clostridioides difficile</i> infection epidemiologic case classification algorithms to medical record review by the Emerging Infections Program using a linked cohort, 2016-2021.",
    "abstract": "Medicare claims are frequently used to study <i>Clostridioides difficile</i> infection (CDI) epidemiology. However, they lack specimen collection and diagnosis dates to assign location of onset. Algorithms to classify CDI onset location using claims data have been published, but the degree of misclassification is unknown. We linked patients with laboratory-confirmed CDI reported to four Emerging Infections Program (EIP) sites from 2016-2021 to Medicare beneficiaries with fee-for-service Part A/B coverage. We calculated sensitivity of ICD-10-CM codes in claims within Â±28 days of EIP specimen collection. CDI was categorized as hospital, long-term care facility, or community-onset using three different Medicare claims-based algorithms based on claim type, ICD-10-CM code position, duration of hospitalization, and ICD-10-CM diagnosis code presence-on-admission indicators. We assessed concordance of EIP case classifications, based on chart review and specimen collection date, with claims case classifications using Cohen's kappa statistic. Of 12,671 CDI cases eligible for linkage, 9,032 (71%) were linked to a single, unique Medicare beneficiary. Compared to EIP, sensitivity of CDI ICD-10-CM codes was 81%; codes were more likely to be present for hospitalized patients (93.0%) than those who were not (56.2%). Concordance between EIP and Medicare claims algorithms ranged from 68% to 75%, depending on the algorithm used (Îº = 0.56-0.66). ICD-10-CM codes in Medicare claims data had high sensitivity compared to laboratory-confirmed CDI reported to EIP. Claims-based epidemiologic classification algorithms had moderate concordance with EIP classification of onset location. Misclassification of CDI onset location using Medicare algorithms may bias findings of claims-based CDI studies."

    "title": "Bittersweet Challenges: Postharvest Disease Management in Sugarbeet and Sweetpotato.",
    "abstract": "Root crops like sugarbeet and sweetpotato possess an aggregated value that sets them apart from other crops. This aggregated value includes not only their economic importance but also their high nutritional content, which can enhance global food security. However, the economic and nutritional value of these crops is significantly compromised by postharvest diseases, presenting major socio-economic challenges. Postharvest diseases, caused by various fungal and bacterial pathogens, affect crops during field growth, harvest, handling, and storage. Addressing these challenges requires improving several key aspects of disease management that are often lacking in postharvest pathosystems. These aspects include but are not limited to diagnostic methodologies, cultural practices, chemical control, host resistance, and pathogen monitoring among others. Emerging technologies and strategies from various fields offer promising solutions to these challenges. In this manuscript, we review new approaches to address common challenges in postharvest diseases of sugarbeet and sweetpotato. This review highlights important considerations for the implementation, modification, and creation of new approaches to maintain or increase the value of these commodities, which are threatened by postharvest diseases."

    "abstract": "Wilson disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by a defect in hepatocellular copper transport with a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations and reported prevalence. To study the epidemiology and clinical manifestations of WD between two ethnic groups, Jewish and Bedouins, with different marriage patterns, in southern Israel. We conducted a retrospective study investigating the clinical course and laboratory characteristics of children diagnosed with WD who were treated at Soroka University Medical Center. Sixteen patients were diagnosed between 2000 and 2021 (8 males, 50%), 14 were of Bedouins origin. The total cohort prevalence was 1:19,258 while the prevalence of the disease was significantly higher among Bedouins compared to Jews (1:10,828 vs.1:78,270, P-value = 0.004). The median age at diagnosis was 10.2 years, without a significant difference between the groups. The most common presenting symptom was hepatic manifestations: 81.2% had elevated transaminases, 12.5% had jaundice, 25% had neurological symptoms, one had a Kayser-Fleischer ring, and one had psychosis. The mean ceruloplasmin level was 3.0 mg/dl. During follow-up, nine patients normalized transaminases with treatment, while three required liver transplantation. There was no significant difference in the clinical presentation and disease course between the two ethnic groups. Our cohort showed a high prevalence of WD compared to previous studies, especially among the Bedouin population, which has a high consanguinity rate. The prognosis of WD in our population is similar to other studies and depends mainly on treatment compliance."

    "abstract": "To assess trends of severe HIV disease (SHD) and mortality/loss to follow-up (LTFU) among children living with HIV in rural Tanzania. Among children aged 0-14 years living with HIV enrolled in the prospective Kilombero & Ulanga Antiretroviral Cohort in January 2005-December 2023, we determined WHO-defined SHD prevalences at enrolment, mortality/LTFU incidence during follow-up using Kaplan-Meier methods, and associated factors using regression models. At enrolment, among 1089 children [567 (52%) males, 587 (54%) aged <5 years and 530 (49%) with a HIV WHO stage III/IV], 112/332 (34%) had CD4 cell count <200 cells/Î¼L among those aged 5-14 years. In children aged 5-14 years, SHD was diagnosed in 265/502 (53%) with a prevalence of 35-94% declining after 2013. Among children aged <5 years, 374/587 (64%) had SHD with no change over time. Male gender [adjusted odds ratio = 1.45; 95% confidence interval: 1.10-1.90], age <5 years versus older (1.64; 1.13-2.37), hospitalization versus outpatients (6.72; 3.35-13.5), antiretroviral treatment (ART) start within 30 days versus later (2.18; 1.52-3.13), and enrolment during 2013-2016 versus before (2.29; 1.54-3.41) were associated with SHD. After a median follow-up of 3.3 years [interquartile ratio: 0.8-7.8], 130 (12%) children died and 359 (35%) were LTFU. Predictors of mortality/LTFU were SHD [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) = 1.54; 95% CI: 1.26-1.89], age <5 years versus older (1.28; 1.01-1.66), hospitalization versus outpatients (1.93; 1.42-2.63), living â¥50 km versus â¤1 km away (1.72; 1.37-2.16) and delayed ART initiation versus within 30 days (3.40; 2.70-4,27), while enrolment 2017-2023 versus before (0.51; 0.37-0.70) was protective. The persisting high prevalence of paediatric SHD and high mortality/LTFU underscores the need for early diagnosis and care."

    "abstract": "In a phase 1 clinical trial, a chimeric hemagglutinin (cHA) immunogen induced antibody responses against the conserved hemagglutinin (HA) stalk domain as designed. Here, we determined the specificity, function, and subsets of B cells induced by cHA vaccination by pairing single-cell RNA sequencing and B cell receptor repertoire sequencing. We have shown that the cHA-inactivated vaccine with a squalene-based adjuvant induced a robust activated B cell and memory B cell (MBC) phenotype against two broadly neutralizing epitopes in the stalk domain. The overall specificities of the acute plasmablast (PB) and MBC responses clonally overlapped, suggesting B cell convergence to these broadly protective epitopes. At 1 year post immunization, we identified that cHA vaccination reshaped the HA-specific MBC pool to enrich for stalk-binding B cells. Altogether, these data indicate the cHA vaccine induced robust and durable B cell responses against broadly protective epitopes of the HA stalk domain, in line with serological data."

    "abstract": "While identification of key risk factors for mortality has contributed to advances in healthcare, the effect of these risk factors in predicting mortality over different time horizons remains unclear. We sought to determine how risk factors predicted shorter-term and longer-term mortality across the age spectrum in adults. We used data from 11 247 adults of the Australian Diabetes, Obesity and Lifestyle (AusDiab) study. Cox multivariable regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) of shorter-term (0-10 years) and longer-term (10-20 years) all-cause and cardiovascular disease (CVD)-related mortality associated with risk factors. Models with interaction between baseline age and each risk factor were also fitted. During a 20-year follow-up, 2185 deaths occurred. Smoking, diabetes, male sex and albuminuria all independently predicted shorter- and longer-term all-cause and CVD mortality. Most associations were stronger in the shorter term compared to the longer term. A notable exception was the association between smoking and CVD mortality, which was stronger in the longer term (HR 3.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.57-4.90) compared to the shorter term (HR 2.06, 95% CI 1.33-3.20). The magnitude of association between most risk factors and mortality attenuated with age. Classical risk factors for total and CVD mortality remain important up to 20 years after their measurement. In unselected adult cohorts, longer-term follow-up (e.g. beyond 10 years) may not provide additional information on associations of risk factors with mortality beyond that obtained in shorter-term follow-up."

    "abstract": "This study investigates the role of donor-specific antibodies (DSAs) in liver transplantation outcomes, focusing on their effects on liver damage. Ninety-four patients who underwent liver transplantation between 2019 and 2024 at AtatÃ¼rk University were included. DSA testing was performed using the Luminex QIAGEN LifeCodes method. Patient demographic data, laboratory results, clinical conditions, and biopsy findings were analyzed. Disease-specific analyses were conducted for Wilson's disease, autoimmune hepatitis, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and hepatitis B virus (HBV). Due to the limited sample size, larger validation studies are needed, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the data collection process was considered. At the end of 1 year, persistent DSA had no significant effect on liver damage. However, early DSA positivity, particularly persistence and titration, requires further investigation. In Wilson's disease, two DSA-positive patients (mean fluorescence intensity [MFI] 1,000-1,500) showed no damage. Among autoimmune hepatitis patients, 5 of 19 were DSA positive (MFI 1,700-5,600), with no detected damage. Four HCC patients were DSA positive (MFI 1,300-2,200). Among HBV patients, 12 of 31 were DSA positive, and 5 experienced liver damage. Tacrolimus levels in the third month were statistically associated with bilirubin levels. Prospective studies are needed to further clarify the clinical significance of DSA."

    "abstract": "Tremor is a hyperkinetic movement disorder defined as a rhythmic, involuntary, oscillatory movement of a body part. It can present as early as in the neonatal period and may be an isolated finding or part of an associated neurological or systemic disorder. Although it is commonly seen in childhood, it is not frequently described in the literature. This review aims to provide a clinically useful overview of pediatric tremors based on the current literature. We identified relevant studies published in English by searching PubMed (until February 2024), using the following subject headings: pediatric/tremor, deep brain stimulation, and focused ultrasound. Data from 65 articles were critically reviewed with focus on tremor classification, etiologies, clinical features, and management. Some tremor disorders in children can persist into adulthood, however, others are exclusively seen in the pediatric population. The lack of epidemiological and clinical studies in the pediatric population creates substantial challenges for pediatricians, and medical decisions are mostly guided by adult data."

    "title": "Unlearning clubs: creating environments of cultural safety, anti-racism, and trustworthiness in population and public health.",
    "abstract": "Unlearning is a necessary practice for disrupting the deeply ingrained colonial narratives and racialized assumptions that sustain racism in Canada. We created and implemented an \"Unlearning Club\" in British Columbia's Office of the Provincial Health Officer (OPHO). It is a structured and on-going space where public health professionals and trainees critically engage with Indigenous rights, anti-racism, anti-white supremacy, and cultural safety. The Unlearning Club and the reflective research presented in this paper draw on the frameworks of Dr. Camara Jones and Jody Wilson-Raybould to guide three key processes: naming racism and white supremacy (LEARN), asking, how are they operating here (UNDERSTAND), and organizing and strategizing to act (ACT). To document teachings and reflections, we used two approaches. Participants completed a structured rapid reflection tool (n = 67) after each session to capture experiences and insights. Second, Unlearning Club hosts engaged in a relational reflection process, allowing for deeper discussion on lessons learned and future directions. PRAGMATIC REFLECTIONS: (1) Spotlighting Land Acknowledgement: starting each session with a more in-depth land acknowledgments allowed participants to ground their unlearning in the place-based inherent rights of Indigenous Peoples. (2) Relational Accountability: Unlearning Club nurtured solidarity and accountability among colleagues, giving tools needed to move into action. (3) Sustained Unlearning: The process of unlearning led to profound shifts in perspective, as individuals were unable to \"unsee\" pervasive ways in which white supremacy operates, moving individuals beyond feeling paralyzed by injustice. (4) Collective Responsibility: The cohort model allowed relationship-building and fostered shared commitment to addressing racism and white supremacy, creating a stronger group-wide sense of purpose and accountability. (5) Counters Resistance: Eagerness and gratitude was widespread among participants; individuals were willing to invest the time and effort necessary to engage deeply in the unlearning process. (6) Moving to Action: Participants highlighted the effectiveness of the \"Learn, Understand, Act\" framework in preventing stagnation. This structured approach offered clear pathways to translate new insights into tangible actions. The Unlearning Club has emerged as a pivotal strategy for fostering environments of cultural safety, anti-racism, and trustworthiness within our public health office. Sustained engagement in anti-racist education, supported by strong leadership and an inclusive structure, can significantly reduce resistance to anti-racism initiatives."

A composite outcome of any new diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, cataracts, pneumonia, osteoporosis, or nontraumatic fracture; and recurrent event outcomes of repeated pneumonia or nontraumatic fracture were compared for long-term (>24 months) vs short-term (<4 months) ICS exposure. We assessed outcomes for 318,385 and 209,062 individuals in the prevalent and inception cohorts, respectively. The composite dichotomous outcome was significantly greater for long-term vs short-term ICS use for the prevalent (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.65; 95% CI, 2.62-2.68; <i>P</i> <.001) and inception (HR = 2.60; 95% CI, 2.56-2.64; <i>P</i> <.001) cohorts.

    "abstract": "Many nephrologists considered that renal involvement in diabetes patients was seen as nodular glomerulosclerosis (i.e., Kimmelstiel-Wilson lesions). However, they diagnosed diabetic nephropathy or diabetic kidney disease (DKD) from clinical information on diabetes history, and reports of evaluation by kidney biopsy were scarce. Since the publication of the Tervaert classification of diabetic nephropathy in 2010, reports of kidney biopsy in these patients have increased. Analysis of biopsy specimens revealed not only the Tervaert classification (class I to IV) based on glomerular lesions, but also various other pathologies. Besides nodular lesions, findings included paratubular basement membrane insudative lesions (PTBMILs), polar vasculosis, and nephropathy associated with novel drugs (sodium-glucose transport protein 2 inhibitors and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors). PTBMILs are unique to diabetic nephropathy. In patients with continuous hyperglycemia and excessive salt intake, elevated blood osmolality (calculated by serum Na Ã 2 + serum glucose/18 + serum urea nitrogen/2.8) leads to thirst and excessive drinking, which results in fluid overload and generalized edema. The increase in circulating blood volume is thought to induce PTBMILs because of the influx of serum components into the endothelium of glomerular vessels. This case series review presents diverse kidney biopsy findings in patients with diabetic nephropathy or diabetic kidney disease as well as the pathogenesis."

    "abstract": "In 2014, 2016, and 2018, infection with enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) was associated with outbreaks of a poliomyelitis-like paralytic syndrome, called acute flaccid myelitis (AFM). While only a small fraction of patients infected with EV-D68 developed AFM, this subgroup of patients does not typically seek treatment until after the onset of neurological symptoms. There are currently no approved human monoclonal antibody therapies or vaccines available for EV-D68. Here, we show that a monoclonal antibody, EV68-228-N, can quickly stop the progression of paralysis in a mouse model of AFM, even when treatment is initiated after the onset of paralysis. We found that EV68-228-N effectively halted the progression of paralysis when tested against both 2014 and 2016 EV-D68 isolates in an immunocompetent mouse model of AFM. All animal experiments were conducted in a blinded fashion. The IC<sub>50</sub> of EV68-228-N against 2014 and 2016 EV-D68 isolates was confirmed <i>in vitro</i> to be less than 330 ng/mL, and EV68-228-N was found to be equally effective at neutralizing 2018 and 2022 viral isolates without any evidence of emerging resistance. We further show that, following infection with EV-D68, mice treated with EV68-228-N have more surviving motor neurons in the spinal cord's lumbar enlargement than control treated animals. Taken together, this work suggests that EV68-228-N treatment has the potential to halt the progression of paralysis in AFM patients who present at the clinic with neurologic symptoms and that EV68-228-N will retain neutralization potential against emerging EV-D68 isolates. Enterovirus D-68 (EV-D68) associated acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) is an emergent poliomyelitis-like illness occurring predominantly in children. There are currently no proven effective therapies. We describe the use of a human monoclonal antibody (EV68-228-N) in a murine model of EV-D68 AFM in which therapy prevents progression of paralysis even when treatment is instituted after onset of weakness. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT06444048."

    "abstract": "We aimed to analyze the clinical features, treatment, and prognosis of Wilson disease (WD) combined with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and to explore the correlation between endocrine abnormalities and liver damage. The clinical data of 40 female patients of WD combined with PCOS (PCOS-WD) were retrospectively analyzed. 43 age- and BMI-matched patients of PCOS with non-WD (PCOS-NWD) were performed as the control group. The patients of PCOS-WD were assigned to adolescent group (n = 18) and reproductive age group (n = 22) according to the age onset of PCOS, and also assigned to normal testosterone group (n = 18) and elevated testosterone group (n = 22) according to the testosterone level. The clinical features, laboratory tests, imaging examinations, treatment, and outcome of all patients were analyzed, and correlation analysis was processed between gonadal hormone and liver damage parameters. The testosterone level was significantly higher in the PCOS-NWD than in the PCOS-WD patients (Z=-2.306, P = 0.021). The clinical hyperandrogenism was significantly more prevalent in adolescent group within PCOS-WD patients (P = 0.025), while the serum alanine aminotransferase was significantly higher in reproductive age group (Z=-2.572, P = 0.010). The hepatic fibrosis index was significantly higher in elevated testosterone group than in normal testosterone group (Z = -2.190, P = 0.029), while the progesterone level was lower in elevated testosterone group (Z = 2.394, P = 0.017). The testosterone level was positively correlated with the hepatic fibrosis index (P = 0.039, R = 0.328). In followed-up observations, no significant difference was found in menstrual cycle and pregnancy outcomes between progesterone combined with copper chelation therapy and copper chelation therapy alone. PCOS is an important endocrine comorbidity of female WD patients. The extent of liver damage in WD patients may be related to the hormonal imbalance of PCOS. The study recommends routine screening for PCOS in adolescent WD patients. Testosterone levels may serve as a valuable reference for informing treatment decisions. Copper chelation therapy with or without progesterone is beneficial to the recovery of patients with PCOS-WD."

This study aimed to describe the use of ICS in patients with bronchiectasis across Europe. Patients with bronchiectasis were enrolled into the European Bronchiectasis Registry from 2015 to 2022. Patients were grouped into ICS users and non-users at baseline and clinical characteristics associated with ICS use were investigated. Patients were followed up for clinical outcomes of exacerbation, hospitalisation and mortality for up to 5 years. We evaluated if elevated blood eosinophil counts (above the laboratory upper limit of normal) modified the effect of ICS on exacerbations. 19 324 patients were included for analysis and 10 109 (52.3%) were recorded as being prescribed ICS at baseline. After exclusion of patients with a history of asthma, COPD and/or ABPA, 3174/9715 (32.7%) patients with bronchiectasis were prescribed ICS. Frequency of ICS use varied across countries, ranging from 17% to 85% of included patients. ICS users had more severe disease, with significantly worse lung function, higher Bronchiectasis Severity Index scores and more frequent exacerbations at baseline (p<0.0001). Overall, ICS users did not have a reduced risk of exacerbation or hospitalisation during follow-up, but a significant reduction in exacerbation frequency was observed in the subgroup of ICS users with elevated blood eosinophil counts (relative risk 0.70, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.84, p<0.001). ICS use is common in bronchiectasis, including in those not currently recommended ICS according to bronchiectasis guidelines. ICS use may be associated with reduced exacerbation frequency in patients with elevated blood eosinophils."

    "title": "Insights from ADPedKD, ERKReg and RaDaR registries provide a multi-national perspective on the presentation of childhood autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease in high- and middle-income countries.",
    "abstract": "Data on the presentation of Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) in children have been based on small/regional cohorts and practices regarding both asymptomatic screening in minors and genetic testing differ greatly between countries. To provide a global perspective, we analyzed over 2100 children and adolescents with ADPKD from 32 countries in six World Health Organization regions: 1060 children from the multi-national ADPedKD registry were compared to 269 pediatric patients from the United Kingdom (RaDaR) and 825 from the European Rare Kidney Disease Registry (ERKReg). Asymptomatic family screening was a common mode of presentation (48% in ADPedKD, 62% in ERKReg) with broad international variability (19%-75%), but fairly stable temporal trends in both registries with no correlation to genetic testing. The national rates of genetic testing varied and correlated significantly with healthcare expenditure (odds ratio 1.030 per 100 United States Dollars/capita/year, in the ERKReg cohort), with little variation over time. Diagnosis due to prenatal abnormalities was more common than anticipated at 14% increasing steadily from 2000 onward in both registries. Realistically, a high proportion of children were diagnosed with ADPKD by active screening, underlining that families affected by ADPKD have a high need for counselling on the complex issues around presymptomatic diagnosis. Regional variations in rate of genetic testing appeared to be driven by economic factors. However, large differences in rate of active screening were not correlated to healthcare spending and probably reflect the influence of different of cultural, legal and ethical frameworks on families and clinicians in different healthcare systems."

    "title": "Characterizing the Cost Trends of Readmissions After Aseptic Revision Total Knee Arthroplasty.",
    "abstract": "A rise in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) volume has led to an increased incidence of aseptic revision TKA (rTKA), resulting in major associated health care costs. This study evaluated the economic impact and clinical factors associated with readmission following aseptic rTKA, aiming to identify key drivers of cost and risk factors for readmission. This retrospective analysis used data from a large national database from January 1, 2009, to June 30, 2022. Patients undergoing aseptic rTKA were identified via Current Procedural Terminology codes. Readmissions within 90 days postoperatively were analyzed. Baseline characteristics, comorbidities, and readmission costs were compared, and significant risk factors for readmission were identified. Of 34,144 aseptic rTKA patients, 1,953 (5.7%) were readmitted within 90 days (56.1% medical, 29.2% surgical, and 14.8% unknown). The median cost of all readmissions was $25,181. Readmissions requiring reoperation had a higher cost (median $40,524 versus $20,907, P < 0.001). Among readmissions for surgical complications, periprosthetic joint infection was the most common cause (36.3%) and was associated with the greatest cost (median $38,104). The most common medical causes of readmission were rehabilitative care, ischemic cardiac events, and acute kidney injury. Significant risk factors for all-cause readmission included men, index revision for periprosthetic fracture, and comorbidities, including diabetes, coronary artery disease, renal disease, and congestive heart failure. Readmission after aseptic rTKA results in a major economic burden to the health care system, particularly in readmission pertaining to surgical complications and requiring reoperation. This study highlights the need for targeted strategies aimed at effectively reducing the rate and costs associated with readmission post-rTKA with a goal of cost containment and improved patient outcomes."

    "title": "The Pseudomonas aeruginosa PhuS proximal ligand His-209 triggers a conformational switch in function from DNA binding to heme transfer.",
    "abstract": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa can acquire iron from heme via the heme assimilation system and Pseudomonas heme uptake (Phu) systems. Heme uptake is regulated at the metabolic level by the cytoplasmic protein PhuS that controls heme flux through a heme oxygenase HemO, releasing iron and biliverdin IXÎ² and IXÎ´. We have shown PhuS regulates extracellular heme flux, and in its apo-form transcriptionally regulates the iron and heme-dependent small RNAs (sRNAs) PrrF/PrrH. This mutual exclusivity of function is driven by conformational rearrangement of PhuS on heme binding. Herein, we show through a combination of EMSA and fluorescence anisotropy that mutation of the His-209 proximal ligand allows both apo- and holo-PhuS H209A to bind to the prrF1 promoter with significantly lower affinity when compared to PAO1 WT. Hydrogen deuterium exchange coupled to mass spectrometry revealed the apo- and holo-PhuS H209A structures are closer to each other than their WT counterparts and sample a conformational landscape between the apo- and holo-PhuS WT conformations, that is neither optimal for heme transfer nor DNA-binding. Furthermore, quantitative PCR and Western blot analysis of the phuSH209A allelic strain compared to PAO1 WT revealed an uncoupling of the PhuS-HemO dependent regulation of heme flux into the cell that abrogates the heme dependent regulation of the PrrF/PrrH sRNAs. The data supports a model where heme coordination through His-209 drives the conformational switch that determines mutual exclusivity in function of apo- and holo-PhuS. This dual function of PhuS is central to integrating extracellular heme utilization into the PrrF/PrrH sRNA regulatory network critical for P. aeruginosa adaptation within the host."

    "abstract": "The study of social determinants of health in kidney transplantation has historically focused on equitable access, with limited evidence on the short- and long-term outcomes beyond graft loss and mortality. Our purpose is to identify and assess factors to ensure equitable outcomes after kidney transplant by identifying targets for health-care interventions in the posttransplant phase of care. This is a single institution, cohort study of adults who received deceased donor kidney transplantation at a high-volume transplant center. Transplant recipients were stratified by social deprivation index (SDI) at the population mean of 60. The primary outcome is change in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). A total of 236 recipients were included, 48% (n = 113) were from higher deprivation neighborhoods (SDI >60). These recipients were younger, more likely to be black, and had lower estimated posttransplant survival scores. Both groups received grafts with similar kidney donor profile index scores. Despite similar discharge eGFR, recipients from high SDI neighborhoods had significantly lower eGFRs at all follow-up points, confirmed with mixed-effect analysis. Recipients from neighborhoods with higher deprivation index have worse short- and long-term graft function, despite being younger, having lower estimated posttransplant survival scores, and similar graft kidney donor profile index at transplantation. This unexplained compromise in graft function is an opportunity for community-based interventions after recipients receive deceased donor kidney transplantation."

    "abstract": "Motor neurone disease is an incurable neurodegenerative condition that progressively impairs motor function. It affects mobility, speech, swallowing and breathing, leading to significant dependence on others. Home mechanical ventilation can alleviate respiratory symptoms and improve survival. To examine the experiences of bereaved family members involved in the care of someone with motor neurone disease who had died with home mechanical ventilation in place, or following its withdrawal. An interpretive constructivist approach was used to carry out qualitative interviews. Bereaved family members from England and Wales whose relative had died with ventilation in place, or after withdrawal. Thirty-six bereaved family members took part. Their experiences highlight the extensive responsibilities and emotional burdens of managing home mechanical ventilation. Family members reported feelings of heightened responsibility, distrust in the abilities of professional caregivers, significant impacts on their mental and physical well-being and the ways in which knowledgeable care providers could lift such responsibilities. As the use of technology to sustain life increases, we need to question how much we expect of family members in providing care for those with complex interventions, such as ventilation, at home. This research underscores the critical role family members' play in home care for people with motor neurone disease and calls for a greater understanding of the impacts of maintaining responsibility for life-sustaining treatments. There is a need for better support and training for both family and professional caregivers to alleviate some of the responsibility placed upon family members."

    "abstract": "Immune-mediated adverse reactions to food allergens are rising at a striking rate, for reasons that are not completely understood. Our previous studies suggest that the stress-activated transcription factor Nrf2 (Nuclear factor erythroid 2 -related factor) promotes Th2 differentiation, while inhibiting Th1 differentiation. In the present studies, we investigated the effect of Nrf2 activation on sensitization and anaphylaxis in response to food allergen in BALB/c mice. Specifically, we determined the effect of the Nrf2 activator and common food preservative tBHQ (<i>tert</i>-butylhydroquinone) on immune response to food allergen in Balb/c mice and SCID mice that received either wild-type or Nrf2-deficient CD4 T cells. Our results demonstrate that tBHQ strongly increases IgE sensitization to ovalbumin (OVA) with a concurrent increase in plasma IgG1 concentrations. In addition, tBHQ in diet also exacerbated anaphylaxis and increased mast cell degranulation. In a recall response, tBHQ promoted a type 2 T cell response. Notably, adoptive transfer studies in SCID recipient mice indicate that Nrf2 expression in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells is critical to sensitization and anaphylaxis in response to food allergen. Likewise, the effects of tBHQ on sensitization and challenge are dependent on Nrf2 expression in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Overall, these studies point to a key role for Nrf2 in the immune response to food allergen. In addition, this study shows that the common food preservative tBHQ promotes allergic sensitization and anaphylaxis in experimental food allergy."

    "title": "Role of Radiation Therapy in the Management of Locally Advanced Vulvar Cancer-15 Years of Experience at a Tertiary Care Center in Southern India.",
    "abstract": "Vulvar carcinoma represents 3-5% of all gynecological malignancies and 1% of female cancers. Primary surgical excision is the cornerstone of treatment for early-stage invasive disease. Adjuvant radiation therapy reduces the risk of local recurrence in patients with high-risk features, and radical chemoradiation is an option for locally advanced vulvar cancer. This retrospective study aimed to analyze the clinical presentation, treatment details, outcomes, patterns of failure, and possible prognostic factors. We reviewed the electronic medical records of 53 patients diagnosed with carcinoma of the vulva from January 2005 to December 2020. All patients with biopsy-proven carcinoma of the vulva who received radiation therapy with or without surgery were included in the study. The median age at presentation was 59 years (range 35-85 years). The most common stage at presentation was Stage III (37.7%, <i>n</i> = 20), followed by Stage IB (22.6%, <i>n</i> = 12). Thirty patients (56.6%) underwent surgery, and the majority (76.7%) underwent radical vulvectomy with bilateral inguinofemoral block dissection. Nineteen patients (55.9%) received adjuvant radiation therapy for various indications, such as close margins, positive margins, or positive nodes. Twenty patients (37.7%) received definitive chemoradiation therapy, for a median dose of 66 Gy in 33 fractions. Acute toxicity in the form of Grade 3 dermatitis was observed in 19 out of 45 patients (42.2%) who received RT, and late toxicity in the form of lymphedema was observed in 5 patients (11.1%). The median follow-up was 20 months (0-170 months). At follow-up, 25 patients (47.1%) were disease free or had stable disease, 14 patients (26.4%) had local or inguinal nodal recurrence or progression, 2 patients (3.7%) had metastatic disease (lung, mediastinal node), and 13 patients (24.5%) were lost to follow-up. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 24 months (95% CI 17.2 to 30.8 months), and the median overall survival (OS) was 29 months (95% CI 21-37 months). Radical surgery followed by adjuvant radiation therapy led to superior outcomes in terms of progression-free survival (<i>p</i> = 0.0001) and overall survival (<i>p</i> = 0.005). Radical surgery followed by adjuvant radiation therapy was associated with the most favorable PFS and OS. Definitive chemoradiation therapy with modern radiation techniques is an alternative to radical surgery for medically/surgically inoperable locally advanced vulvar cancer patients and has favorable outcomes and toxicity profiles. Given the rarity of vulvar carcinoma, further research and multicenter studies are warranted to enhance our understanding of this malignancy and optimize treatment strategies to improve patient outcomes."

    "abstract": "Therapies targeting blood vessels hold promise for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), the most common inherited disorder causing kidney failure. However, the onset and nature of kidney vascular abnormalities in ADPKD are poorly defined. Accordingly, we employed a combination of single-cell transcriptomics; three-dimensional imaging with geometric, topological and fractal analyses; and multimodal magnetic resonance imaging with arterial spin labelling to investigate aberrant microvasculature in ADPKD kidneys. Within human ADPKD kidneys with advanced cystic pathology and excretory failure, we identified a molecularly distinct blood microvascular subpopulation, characterised by impaired angiogenic signalling and metabolic dysfunction, differing from endothelial injury profiles observed in non-cystic human kidney diseases. Next, Pkd1 mutant mouse kidneys were examined postnatally, when cystic pathology is well established, but before excretory failure. An aberrant endothelial subpopulation was also detected, concurrent with reduced cortical blood perfusion. Disorganised kidney cortical microvasculature was also present in Pkd1 mutant mouse fetal kidneys when tubular dilation begins. Thus, aberrant features of cystic kidney vasculature are harmonised between human and mouse ADPKD, supporting early targeting of the vasculature as a strategy to ameliorate ADPKD progression."

    "abstract": "<b>Objective:</b> Blood-based biomarkers are valued for their lower cost and less invasive nature, though issues with widespread implementation and accessibility remain. Process-based scores from story recall have been shown to detect neuronal network disturbances typical of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology more effectively than traditional metrics. This study examined the associations between process-based scores and concurrent plasma AD biomarkers in older adults without dementia, while also comparing them to traditional metrics. Additionally, it also investigated the diagnostic utility of these metrics in detecting plasma p-tau217 positivity. <b>Methods:</b> Data from 416 participants (mean age = 66.6 Â± 7) free of dementia were extracted from the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention (WRAP). Logical Memory Test (LMT) and plasma p-tau217, p-tau181, p-tau231, AÎ²42/AÎ²40 ratio, GFAP and NfL levels were analyzed. Bayesian regression models assessed associations between plasma biomarkers and both process-based and traditional LMT scores, controlling for the covariates. <b>Results:</b> The best-fitting model for plasma p-tau217 included Total ratio (Tr) and Immediate recall (BF10=573), but Tr showed stronger evidence of association (mean coefficient = 0.208; BFinclusion=14.4) than Immediate recall (mean coefficient=-0.007; BFinclusion=1.7). Tr was also the best predictor of plasma p-tau181 (mean coefficient = 0.144; BF10=10.5) and GFAP (mean coefficient = 0.141; BF10=5.8), outperforming traditional LMT scores. No memory scores were associated with plasma p-tau231 or AÎ²42/40 ratio levels. Tr score was the strongest single predictor of p-tau217 positivity (BF<sub>10</sub>=38). <b>Conclusions:</b> These findings suggest that process-based memory scores might be useful in enhancing the detection of neuronal network disturbances associated with AD pathology, especially in settings where biomarker testing is unavailable."

    "abstract": "Fusarium wilt is a significant problem restricting the growth of the lily industry. However, Lilium regale Wilson is a valuable germplasm resource because of its Fusarium Wilt resistance. In this study, six endo-Î²-1,4-glucanase genes (Cel1-Cel6) in L. regale were identified among the differentially expressed genes reveled by omics data for L. regale infected Fusarium osysporum, which causes Fusarium wilt. Interestingly, the abundance of a few proteins and the expression of endo-Î²-1,4-glucanase genes, including LrCel1, decreased in L. regale roots infected with F. oxysporum. Thus, the function of LrCel1 in the incompatible interaction between L. regale and F. oxysporum was analyzed. LrCel1 expression was inhibited by F. oxysporum and salicylic acid (SA). Additionally, the subcellular localization of LrCel1 revealed it was a cell membrane protein. The ectopic expression of LrCel1 increased of susceptibility of tobacco to F. oxysporum because of the associated increase in cellulase activity, which, hindered the production of cellulose, callose, and lignin. Moreover, LrCel1 overexpression inhibited the accumulation of SA and jasmonic acid (JA), resulting in the down-regulated expression of genes associated with SA/JA signaling pathways. Conversely, introducing an RNAi vector targeting LrCel1 into L. regale enhanced the resistance to F. oxysporum, likely because of an increase in the synthesis of cellulose, callose, and lignin as well as a decrease in the expression of JA/SA signaling pathway genes. In addition, LrCel1 promoter activity was suppressed by F. oxysporum and Fusarium solani as well as SA. Furthermore, a positive regulator of Fusarium wilt resistance, LrWRKY11, negatively regulated LrCel1 promoter activity. The study findings have elucidated the intricate regulatory network of WRKY transcription factor and SA/JA signaling pathways to inhibit the cellulase activity of endo-Î²-1,4-glucanase in L. regale, thereby conferring resistance to Fusarium wilt."

    "abstract": "Excessive bacterial contamination (â¥100,000 colony forming units [CFU]/ml total bacteria count (TBC) and â¥ 10,000 CFU/ml total coliform count [TCC]) reduces the quality of colostrum and subsequent absorption of IgG across neonatal enterocytes, leading to failure to transfer of passive immunity (FTPI). Furthermore, the presence of pathogenic bacteria can cause disease in their own right. The objectives of the study were to identify critical control points and farm risk factors to minimise colostrum contamination from Scottish dairy herds. Eleven farms in Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland, were enrolled and first milking colostrum was sampled at sequential control points throughout the harvest, storage and feeding process. Farmers also completed a questionnaire at enrolment detailing colostrum management practices to identify risk factors for high bacterial contamination. Samples then underwent testing to estimate TBC, TCC and Brix % (measure of total solids estimating IgG concentration). Samples collected directly from cows' teats had a lower median TBC (4000 CFU/ml, IQR = 15,000 CFU/ml) and TCC (1850, CFU/ml, IQR = 3775 CFU/ml) than those collected from storage buckets (median TBC = 101,000 CFU/ml, IQR = 930,000 CFU/ml and median TCC = 12,000, IQR = 108,000 CFU/ml) and feeding equipment (median TBC = 410,000 CFU/ml, IQR 3230,000 CFU/ml; median TCC = 40,000, IQR = 375,000 CFU/ml). Linear regression models revealed higher bacterial contamination was associated with a larger number of buckets used between harvest and storage of colostrum; smaller size of containers used to store colostrum, method of colostrum storage (freezing), and method of teat cleaning (wet wipe). Mean teat, storage bucket and feeder Brix (%) values were 23.1 %, 22 % and 23.1 % respectively. A one-way repeated ANOVA showed no difference in Brix % between source type (F = 2(3168), p = 0.1). Brix % was negatively associated with increasing time from calving to colostrum harvest."

    "abstract": "West Nile virus (WNV) and Usutu virus (USUV) are closely related mosquito-borne neurotropic flaviviruses that share common transmission cycle and can infect humans. However, while human infections by WNV are widespread, infections by USUV are comparatively less frequent, less severe, and currently limited to Africa and Europe. To identify human host factors that contribute to the pathogenic signatures of these two flaviviruses, we carried out an arrayed expression screen of over 1,300 interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Several ISGs known to target flaviviruses, including IFI6, SHFL, and RTP4 were among the strongest hits. Interestingly, we also found MITD1, an ISG with no previously reported antiviral activity, among the strongest hits. We demonstrated that the antiviral activity of MITD1 was not limited to USUV and WNV, since it also inhibited Zika and dengue virus replication. We found MITD1 to interfere with viral RNA replication by sequestering specific endosomal sorting complexes required for transport-III (ESCRT-III) proteins involved in the formation of viral replication factories. MITD1 expression was not increased by type I interferon (IFN-I) in most human cells and mouse tissues that we examined, although WNV and USUV replication was strongly inhibited by IFN-I. Strikingly, MITD1 was induced in the brain of USUV-infected mice and importantly, in human monocyte-derived microglia. Using human microglial-like cells, we confirmed that MITD1 is an essential mediator of the anti-flavivirus activity of IFN-I in these cells. We conclude that MITD1 plays a key role in the cellular defenses against neurotropic flaviviruses."

    "abstract": "Decisions about health care, such as the effectiveness of new treatments for disease, are regularly made based on evidence from published work. However, poor reporting of statistical methods and results is endemic across health research and risks ineffective or harmful treatments being used in clinical practice. Statistical modelling choices often greatly influence the results. Authors do not always provide enough information to evaluate and repeat their methods, making interpreting results difficult. Our research is designed to understand current reporting practices and inform efforts to educate researchers. Reporting practices for linear regression were assessed in 95 randomly sampled published papers in the health field from PLOS ONE in 2019, which were randomly allocated to statisticians for post-publication review. The prevalence of reporting practices is described using frequencies, percentages, and Wilson 95% confidence intervals. While 92% of authors reported p-values and 81% reported regression coefficients, only 58% of papers reported a measure of uncertainty, such as confidence intervals or standard errors. Sixty-nine percent of authors did not discuss the scientific importance of estimates, and only 23% directly interpreted the size of coefficients. Our results indicate that statistical methods and results were often poorly reported without sufficient detail to reproduce them. To improve statistical quality and direct health funding to effective treatments, we recommend that statisticians be involved in the research cycle, from study design to post-peer review. The research environment is an ecosystem, and future interventions addressing poor statistical quality should consider the interactions between the individuals, organisations and policy environments. Practical recommendations include journals producing templates with standardised reporting and using interactive checklists to improve reporting practices. Investments in research maintenance and quality control are required to assess and implement these recommendations to improve the quality of health research."

    "abstract": "An assessment of amino acid and amine concentrations is important for the diagnosis and management of inherited metabolic disorders (IMDs). Methods exist that measure these biologically important metabolites but are cost-prohibitive and/or time consuming. We therefore sought to develop a novel methodology, applicable to IMDs, that is both high-throughput and low cost. Previously, we developed a methodology for rapid, repeatable, and cost-efficient separation of approximately 20 amines as a proof of concept and now expand it to amines relevant to IMDs. We describe our separation methodology using reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet-visible spectrum absorbance paired with pre-column derivatization with <i>o</i>-pthalaldehyde. We show reproducibility via concentration assessments, in triplicate, for each amine. We assess amines in prepared standard solutions and in biologic samples from patients with IMDs. We also detected and assessed the amino group containing compounds glutathione (oxidized and reduced forms) and ammonia. Validation was established using absolute area under the curve (AUC) and via comparison using a single internal standard. We report good separation of 40 primary amino group containing metabolites, in a single, 53 min run. This rapid, low cost, and accurate methodology only requires a small volume of sample and can greatly increase availability and access. Finally, the numerous amines and unique compounds detected in our single run has large utility and can potentially increase clinical efficiency and broaden access to research, both important as the need for analysis of amines grows globally."

This study is aimed at observing the effects of copper deposition on cognitive function in a toxic milk (TX) mouse model of Wilson disease (WD), and investigating the effects and mechanisms of action of Gandou Bushen Decoction (GDBSD) on melatonin synthesis and pineal function in the WD model mice. A total of 30 homozygous TX mice were randomly assigned to 3 groups (<i>n</i> = 10 in each group), including a WD group, a GDBSD group, and a dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) group. A total of 10 DL mice were included in the normal control (NC) group. The structure and copper content of pineal gland tissues, oxidative stress and apoptosis-related markers, and serum melatonin levels were evaluated using hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), flow cytometry, and Western blot. Compared with the NC group, the WD group exhibited decreased learning and cognitive abilities (<i>P</i> < 0.05), damaged pineal gland structure, increased copper content, reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, and mitochondrial damage rate in the pineal gland (<i>P</i> < 0.01), altered levels of melatonin and oxidative stress-related markers (<i>P</i> < 0.05), upregulated expression levels of pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and Caspase-3, and decreased expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 (<i>P</i> < 0.01). After treatment with GDBSD and DMSA, the SIRT3/FOXO3Î± signaling pathway was activated, the copper content in the pineal gland was reduced, and oxidative stress and apoptosis-related damages were improved, leading to an improvement in learning and memory abilities (<i>P</i> < 0.05). GDBSD can alleviate cognitive impairments in WD mice caused by pineal gland copper deposition by inhibiting oxidative stress and apoptosis in the pineal gland. The underlying molecular mechanism is associated with the regulation of the SIRT3/FOXO3Î± signaling pathway."

    "abstract": "Ovarian cancer (OC) poses a significant clinical challenge due to its high recurrence rates and resistance to standard therapies, particularly in advanced stages where recurrence is common, and treatment is predominantly palliative. Personalized treatments, while effective in other cancers, remain underutilized in OC due to a lack of reliable biomarkers predicting clinical outcomes. Accordingly, precision medicine approaches are limited, with PARP inhibitors showing efficacy only in specific genetic contexts. Drug repurposing offers a promising, rapidly translatable strategy by leveraging existing pharmacological data to identify new treatments for OC. Patient-derived polyclonal spheroids, isolated from ascites fluid closely mimic the clinical behavior of OC, providing a valuable model for drug testing. Using these spheroids, a high-throughput drug screening pipeline capable of evaluating both cytotoxicity and anti-migratory properties of a diverse drug library, including FDA-approved, investigational, and newly approved compounds is developed. The findings highlight the importance of 3D culture systems, revealing a poor correlation between drug efficacy in traditional 2D models and more clinically relevant 3D spheroids. This approach has expedited the identification of promising candidates, such as rapamycin, which demonstrated limited activity as a monotherapy but synergized effectively with standard treatments like cisplatin and paclitaxel in vitro. In combination with platinum-based therapy, Rapamycin led to significant in vitro cytotoxicity and a marked reduction in tumor burden in a syngeneic in vivo model. This proof-of-concept study underscores the potential of drug repurposing to rapidly advance new treatments into clinical trials for OC, offering renewed hope for patients with advanced disease."

Few studies have examined associations with multiple nutrients using mixtures approaches, which may better reflect true exposure scenarios. This study aims to examine associations of nutrient mixtures with children's autism diagnosis and trait scores within a large, diverse population. Participants were drawn from the United States Environmental influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) consortium. Maternal prenatal diet was reported via validated food frequency questionnaires. Children's autism-related traits were measured using the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) and autism diagnoses were from parent reports of physician diagnosis. Bayesian kernel machine regression was used to examine the overall mixture effect and interactions between a set of 5 primary nutrients (folate, vitamin D, omega 3 and omega 6 fatty acids, and iron), adjusted for potential confounders, in relationship to child outcomes. Secondary analyses were conducted in a subset of cohorts with an expanded set of 14 nutrients. Traditional linear and logistic regression models were also analyzed for comparison of results to mixture models. A total of 2614 participants drawn from 7 ECHO cohorts were included in primary analysis. Mixture analyses suggested that increasing the overall 5-nutrient mixture was associated with lower SRS scores. Individual U-shaped associations and bivariate interactions between folate and omega 3 fatty acids were suggested. In the subset included in the secondary analyses of the 14-nutrient mixture, a modest inverse trend remained, but individual nutrient associations were altered, with vitamin D demonstrating higher relative importance than other nutrients. Strong associations with autism diagnosis were not observed. In this large sample, we found evidence for combined nutrient effects with broader autism-related traits. Because results for individual nutrients were sensitive to mixture components, replication of combined associations between nutrients and autism-related outcomes is needed."

A retrospective analysis was conducted on the clinical data from 31 patients (62 eyes) who were diagnosed with WD, were positive for KF rings, and who were admitted to our hospital between August 2020 and December 2022. All patients underwent slit-lamp and AS-OCT examinations, with the KF ring width measured on AS-OCT grayscale images. On AS-OCT, the KF ring appeared as a high-reflective band at the level of Descemet membrane. The color band on AS-OCT displayed the ring in shades of yellow-green, yellow, or orange. The width of the KF ring was measured accurately using AS-OCT. AS-OCT, when combined with slit-lamp examination, provides a reliable method for evaluating KF rings in patients with WD. The grayscale measurements obtained via AS-OCT offer precise quantification of the corneal KF ring width."

    "abstract": "In a cluster-randomized trial, we learned that a novel multicomponent intervention designed to improve access to kidney transplantation did not significantly increase the rate of completed steps toward receiving a kidney transplant. Alongside the trial, we conducted a process evaluation to help interpret our findings. To determine whether the intervention addressed targeted barriers to transplant and whether the implementation occurred as planned. Mixed-methods process evaluation informed by implementation science theories. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) programs in Ontario, Canada. These programs, providing care to patients with advanced CKD, participated in the trial from November 1, 2017 to December 31, 2021 (either in the intervention or usual care group). Health care providers (eg, nurses, managers) at Ontario's 27 CKD programs. We conducted surveys (n = 114/162 [70.4%]) and semi-structured interviews (n = 17/26 [65.4%]) with providers in CKD programs in Ontario, Canada. In both the intervention-group and control-group surveys, using the Theoretical Domains Framework, we assessed perceived barriers to transplant and how barriers changed throughout the trial period. In the intervention-group surveys and interviews, using the normalization process theory, we assessed the extent to which the intervention was embedded into daily routines. In the intervention-group surveys, and by completing an implementation checklist, we assessed fidelity of implementation. Perceived barriers to transplant did not substantially differ between providers in the intervention and usual care groups, and both groups reported disagreeing or feeling neutral that the targeted barriers impeded transplant access. Intervention-group providers reported that intervention activities were becoming a regular part of their work and that they engaged with its components. However, they also felt the intervention was complex and described needing more resources, a better execution plan, and more buy-in from frontline staff. Fidelity was high for administrative support, quality improvement teams, delivery of educational resources, and patient peer support. The use of performance reports was low. We identified several possible reasons why the intervention was unsuccessful. Improving access to kidney transplantation remains a high priority for health care systems. We will continue to foster a quality improvement culture, and our results will guide future interventions. Two of the 13 intervention-group CKD programs did not participate in this evaluation.

    "abstract": "Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by pathogenic variants in the <i>ATP7B</i> gene, resulting in the toxic accumulation of copper (Cu). Impaired Cu homeostasis in WD is characterized by low serum ceruloplasmin, excess hepatic Cu, and elevated urinary Cu. WD often presents with hepatic and/or neurological diseases and is fatal if untreated. Adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated gene therapy holds promise for WD, but challenges remain in efficacy and safety. Here, we established an <i>Atp7b</i> R780L knockin (KI) mouse model corresponding to the human <i>ATP7B</i> R778L variant and investigated the therapeutic efficacy and safety of liver-targeted AAV8-mediated <i>ATP7B</i> (AAV8-ÎC4ATP7B) gene therapy in this model. The results demonstrated the <i>Atp7b</i> <sup>KI/KI</sup> mice recapitulated key features of impaired Cu metabolism in WD but had mild liver disease. Ten-week-old <i>Atp7b</i> <sup>KI/KI</sup> mice received a single-dose of AAV8-ÎC4ATP7B and were sacrificed at 8 or 30 weeks after treatment. Treated <i>Atp7b</i> <sup>KI/KI</sup> mice showed normalization of serum ceruloplasmin, reduced hepatic Cu, decreased urinary Cu, and reversed liver histopathology. Serum transaminases had a transient increase at 8 weeks after treatment but returned to normal at 30 weeks after treatment. These data provide evidence for the efficacy and safety of AAV8-ÎC4ATP7B in animals, supporting clinical translation to patients with WD."

This study assessed the long-term outcomes of treatment with TETA-2HCl in Wilson disease patients. In this Phase 2, prospective study, patients continued their treatment of TETA-2HCl 300 mg (200 mg trientine base) for 12 months (July 2015-April 2017) at one center in Germany. Primary outcomes were the safety and efficacy of TETA-2HCl treatment; Biomarkers of copper metabolism; and the course of hepatic and neurologic disease. Overall, 51 patients contributed data. Almost all patients (50 [98.0%]) were considered responders (rating of â¤ 4 at the 12-month visit); Unified Wilson Disease Rating Scale scores improved throughout the study from a mean (standard deviation) of 11.3 (24.31) at Baseline to 8.8 (22.86) at Month 12. Biochemical assessments of liver parameters (transaminases, liver synthesis) as well as markers of copper metabolism (24-h urinary copper, non-ceruloplasmin bound copper (NCC)) showed improved or stable disease throughout the study. Treatment-emergent adverse events were reported in five (9.6%) patients. No patients withdrew from treatment due to adverse events, and no serious adverse events were considered to be treatment-related. This study demonstrated that treatment with TETA-2HCl was effective and well tolerated in hepatic and neurologic disease manifestations. Additionally, improvement in neurological symptoms was reported throughout the trial, suggesting that improvements may be reported for an extended period after initiation of therapy. <b>Trial Registration:</b> NCT02426905."

    "abstract": "Wildlife agencies are tasked with sustaining healthy wildlife populations. Advances in understanding health in wildlife, are, however, suppressed by issues with surveillance. Cost and logistical complexity are leading reasons why ideal surveillance implementation is often infeasible. A particularly important issue in surveillance is the sample size necessary to declare a local wildlife population (or social group) disease free. More precisely, how many animals must we sample to conclude with high confidence that prevalence of an infectious disease is below a specified threshold? Here we show that the answer to this question hinges on the ease of transmission between animals, a factor not considered in standard sample-size formulas. When disease statuses of animals in a local population are positively correlated, such as when a species forms social groups, the sample size requirement needed to declare freedom from disease is substantially lower relative to sample sizes suggested by existing hypergeometric and binomial models. Local wildlife populations or social groups must satisfy key properties for scientists to leverage this saving, but a reduction in cost arising in such a scenario is a welcome win in surveillance implementation."

Infections and vaccines have been implicated as causes triggering GBS. The aim of the study was to identify host genes involved in the pathogenesis of GBS when Zika (ZIKV) and Chikungunya viruses (CHIKV) were introduced in Brazil. A case-control study of GBS was performed when ZIKV and CHIKV were introduced into a naÃ¯ve population. GBS was studied during both acute and postacute phases. RNA sequencing was conducted using whole blood. GBS typically manifested a week after rash and fever; acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy was more frequent. None of the GBS cases had a poor outcome. Serological assays for ZIKV and CHIKV revealed high titers of immunoglobulin G for both viruses in 9 out of 11 subjects. Metatranscriptomic analyses unveiled an increased abundance of reads attributed to Pseudomonas tolaasii and Toxoplasma gondii in the acute phase. Analysis of differentially expressed host genes during the acute phase revealed altered expression of genes associated with axogenesis, synapse assembly, and presynapse organization. Moreover, genes upregulated during acute GBS were primarily related to inflammation and the inflammasome pathways, including AIM2, NLR family genes and LRR-protein genes, and IL-10. These findings suggest that inflammasome activation via AIM2 could play a role in tissue damage during GBS. Further investigation into the general activation of innate inflammatory responses is warranted to elucidate their potential contribution to the pathology of GBS."

A ratio > 15% of the exchangeable copper to total serum copper, known as relative exchangeable copper (REC), has been shown to have a 100% sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of WD but this has not yet been studied in an ALF setting. Patients diagnosed with ALF from 1 November 2011 to 31 December 2023, with available REC determination during the acute event, were included. Thirty-three patients were included (11 with WD and 22 without WD). The median age [IQR] at ALF was 12.9 [8.9-20.2] years, range: 0.6-71.0 years. Serum ceruloplasmin (Cp) < 0.20 g/L and 24 h urinary copper excretion > 1.6 Î¼mol/L had both a sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp) for the diagnosis of WD of 100% and 72.7%, respectively. A ROC analysis of REC determined that the best cut-off point was 14.4% (AUC 1, p < 0.01). All the WD patients had REC values > 14.4%, yielding a sensitivity and specificity of 100. Relative exchangeable copper has 100% sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing Wilson disease in acute liver failure.

    "abstract": "Leishmania infantum can be an opportunistic pathogen, with an immunocompromised status increasing the risk of converting asymptomatic infection to symptomatic visceral leishmaniasis (VL). VL has approximately 5% fatality rate; and HIV coinfection (AIDS/VL) increases this risk. We hypothesized that, relative to those with HIV alone, people with co-infection would have altered T cell activation which could impact on the risk of VL. A cross-sectional study was performed between 2014 and 2016 to determine the prevalence of L. infantum infection in people living with HIV (PLHIV) residing in Brazil (n = 1,372). Subsequent incident cases of VL were ascertained from a public health database through 2018 and from a cohort of families with VL. Immune status of 69 participants was evaluated and comparisons made between those with and without HIV, with latent or with active Leishmania infection and those without HIV but with active or resolved Leishmania or T cell hypersensitivity to Leishmania antigen and healthy control subjects. A total of 24.2% of PLHIV had positive anti-IgG L. infantum antibodies. The relative risk of developing AIDS/VL was 2.27 (95% CI: 0.920 to 5.59; p = 0.07) to HIV/Leish coinfected subjects with positive leishmania serology compared to HIV subjects without leishmania serology. Poor adherence to antiretroviral therapy (p = 0.0008) or prior opportunistic infections (p = 0.0007) was associated with development of AIDS/VL in asymptomatic HIV/Leish. CD4+ and CD8+ T cells counts or viral load were similar between asymptomatic HIV/Leish and HIV subjects. However, activated CD8+CD38+HLA-DR+ T cells were higher in asymptomatic HIV/Leish than HIV. Likewise, senescent (CD57+) and PD1+ CD8+ T cells were higher in asymptomatic HIV/Leish than in AIDS/VL or HIV groups. Although asymptomatic HIV/Leish subjects had CD4+ and CD8+ T cells similar to HIV alone, their CD8+T cells had increased activation and senescence which could contribute to risk of developing VL."

The present study aims to characterize the clinical performance characteristics of the emergent T Cell biomarkers in a multi-center clinical validation cohort. A cohort of 400 adult patients enrolled across 3 academic and 2 community-based autoimmune rheumatic centers, comprised of 105 SLE patients, 173 patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases (ARD), 83 apparently healthy volunteers (AHV) and 39 other (non-autoimmune) disease (OD) controls were tested for TC4d, TIgG, TIgM and an extensive autoantibody profile. Diagnostic specificity was assessed against the ARD, AHV and OD groups, individually. Semi-quantitative flow cytometry analysis included TIgG and TIgM autoantibodies, cell-bound complement activation products (CB-CAPs), TC4d, erythrocyte-bound C4d (EC4d) and B lymphocyte-bound C4d (BC4d). Conventional autoantibodies and soluble complement proteins, C3 and C4, were assessed by ELISA and immunoturbidimetry, respectively. ROC analysis distinguishing ANA-positive (ANA+) SLE (N = 91) from ARD, TIgG, BC4d and TC4d demonstrated AUC values 0.81, 0.80 and 0.79, respectively, outperforming anti-dsDNA (0.72), C3 (0.69), TIgM (0.67), C4 (0.66) and anti-Smith (0.61). A similar ranking of discriminatory power was observed in ROC analysis distinguishing ANA+ SLE vs. OD as well as ANA+ SLE vs. AHV. At 95% diagnostic specificity for SLE vs. AHV, the sensitivity (95% CI) of TC4d, TIgG and TIgM for SLE was 58.1% (48.1 - 67.7%), 31.4% (22.7 - 41.2%) and 29.5% (21.0 - 39.2%), respectively. The T Cell SLE biomarkers uniquely identified 19% (20/105) of SLE patients who were otherwise negative (serologically inactive) for conventional SLE autoantibodies and had normal serum complement levels. Among the serologically inactive SLE subset, the T Cell SLE biomarkers collectively identified 53% of subjects. The novel SLE biomarkers TC4d, TIgG and TIgM consistently outperform conventional markers across multiple cohorts. Their integration enhances diagnostic sensitivity, especially in SLE-specific autoantibody negative patients with normal complement levels. When coupled with conventional biomarkers, these novel tests may enable earlier and more accurate SLE detection, leading to more timely diagnosis and treatment."

    "abstract": "<i>Background:</i> Participation in global health (GH) training experiences is common for US medical trainees (students, residents, and fellows). However, little is known about their experience of \"culture shock\" (CS), which frequently occurs during these transformative crossâcultural immersions. <i>Objectives:</i> The objectives of this study include: (1) quantitatively measure medical trainee psychosocial responses to shortâterm GH electives, (2) identify factors that influence their CS experiences, and (3) determine if the stageâbased CS conceptual framework applies to medical trainees. <i>Methods:</i> Undergraduate and graduate medical education trainees (UME and GME) who participated in shortâterm GH electives between 2016 and 2020 were recruited across nine US institutions. Using a longitudinal survey method, we gathered data predeparture (demographics, resilience, perceived stress (PS), and CS assessments), every 5 days during the elective (CS, PS assessments, and training site conditions), and 30 days postreturn (perceptions of CS experiences). Analyses included summary statistics, linear regressions, and a linear mixed effects model (LMM). <i>Findings:</i> 252 trainees were enrolled, with 140 (56%) included in the LMM. The primary outcome was a culture shock profile (CSP) score, with 96% reporting CS. The only traineeâspecific factor that significantly increased CSP score was trainee type (UME > GME (+22%)). Several GH elective siteâspecific factors significantly influenced CSP score (e.g., support network [-10%], role clarity [-11%], and overwhelmed by medical needs [+10%]). CS experiences were variable and did not progress in predictable, stageâbased fashions, which is discordant from common CS descriptions. <i>Conclusions:</i> Culture shock was a nearâuniversal, diverse experience during GH electives. Onâsite training conditions and elective site host factors influenced CS more than trainee factors in this prepandemic cohort. Further research is required to (1) determine the optimal CS \"balance\" (i.e., promoting transformative learning while mitigating negative professional and personal impacts), (2) offer insight into harmful CS thresholds, (3) identify host perspectives, and (4) inform best practices for GH electives and global partnerships."

This condition causes clinical manifestations, including weight loss and diarrhea, resulting in worldwide economic losses. Subclinical symptoms can manifest during <i>Eimeria</i> infection. Neglecting this disease can lead to severe morbidity and mortality. Therefore, addressing caprine coccidiosis is imperative. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and molecular identification related to the natural infection of <i>Eimeria</i> spp. in domestic goats originating from Java Island, Indonesia. In total, fecal samples from 289 domestic goats were obtained across five provinces on Java Island, Indonesia: East Java, Central Java, D. I. Yogyakarta, West Java, and Banten. Morphological examinations were performed using the modified Whitlock method and saturated sugar flotation. Molecular assays targeting the 18S ribosomal ribonucleic acid have been employed for spp.-specific confirmation. Statistical analysis was performed using the Wilson binomial proportion and chi-square methods implemented in the online software. A total of 92.7% (268/289) of fecal samples tested positive for <i>Eimeria</i> spp. Phylogenetic tree analysis demonstrated that <i>Eimeria christenseni</i> and <i>Eimeria arloingi</i> closely resembled the reference sequences from China, Australia, and other countries.

Though more common in adults, pediatric cases constitute approximately 5% of those seen in adults. Early diagnosis and treatment are critical due to the severe impacts on growth and development in children. Endoscopic transsphenoidal surgery (ETSS) is the preferred first-line treatment for both children and adults. From 2011 to 2024, 3280 patients with pituitary adenoma underwent surgery using the ETSS technique at Loghman Hospital of Tehran, including 213 CD cases, of which 22 were pediatric (under 18 years old). This retrospective study analyzed clinical data such as age, gender, presenting symptoms, family and medical history, imaging characteristics, surgical findings, pathology, follow-up, and postoperative outcomes. Diagnostic criteria included biochemical tests, MRI imaging, and inferior petrosal sinus sampling. Out of 22 pediatric patients, 16 were females and 6 males, with an average age of 14.73 years. Obesity was the initial clinical manifestation in 59% of the patients. According to the Hardy-Wilson classification, 18.2% of patients were stage E, 9.09% stage C, and the rest (excluding MRI-negative patients) stage A. ETSS was performed on all patients, with total hypophysectomy in 18.2% and hemi-hypophysectomy in 9.09%. Postoperative complications included cerebrospinal fluid leakage in 13.63% of patients. Remission was achieved in 95.45% of patients, with a recurrence rate of 4.54%. Hormone imbalances post-surgery included hypocortisolism (50%), hypothyroidism (45.45%), and hypogonadism (13.63%). ETSS is an effective and safe treatment for pediatric CD, achieving high remission rates and minimal complications. This study highlights the importance of specialized surgical care in managing pediatric CD and underscores the need for early diagnosis and intervention. Further studies are warranted to evaluate long-term outcomes and optimize treatment protocols."

However, the absence of predefined viral signal thresholds in wastewater is often presented as a limiting factor in triggering public health action. To overcome this issue, the feasibility of defining alarm threshold for viral loads in wastewater samples was assessed by quantifying genome fragments of SARS-CoV-2, influenza A virus (IAV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), norovirus (NoV), and rotavirus (RoV) by RT-digital PCR (dPCR) in untreated wastewater samples from three treatment plants. Cut-point values were calculated for periods with a high rate of visits to emergency rooms or at-home visits by SOS MÃ©decins for the related diseases. ROC curves were constructed, and the values of alarm threshold in wastewater were defined using the Youden index. For each targeted virus, alarm thresholds were close to each other across the three WWTPs. As indicated by likelihood ratios, evidence to rule in the diagnosis of high rate of visits when the alarm threshold was exceeded ranged from weak to strong and was highest for RSV and SARS-CoV-2. Evidence to rule out the diagnosis when the alarm threshold was not exceeded was strong or moderate for IAV, SARS-CoV-2 and RSV. Diagnostic performance of the test was not as high for NoV and RoV. Positive predictive value was highest for SARS-CoV-2 and RSV. For SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, the definition of an alarm threshold in wastewater could substantially inform the diagnosis of a period with a high rate of medical visits for COVID-19 and bronchiolitis, respectively."

Leipzig score and additionally relative exchangeable copper determination are recommended for diagnosis. Pharmacological therapy comprises chelating agents (penicillamine, trientine) and zinc salts, while only chelators are recommended for significant liver disease. Monitoring is based on clinical symptoms, liver tests and copper metabolism (urinary copper excretion, exchangeable copper) to detect poor compliance and over/under-treatment. Acute liver failure is challenging as making a diagnosis is difficult and pharmacological therapy may not be sufficient to save life.

Parent-reported race and ethnicity and other demographics were assessed as effect modifiers. The IRs of ARE for children born in very low COI neighborhoods was higher (IR = 10.98; 95% CI: 9.71, 12.25) than for other COI categories. Rates for non-Hispanic Black (NHB) children were significantly higher than non-Hispanic White children in every COI category. The ARE IRs for children born in very low COI neighborhoods were several-fold higher for NHB and Hispanic Black children (IR = 15.30; 95% CI: 13.10, 17.49; and IR = 18.48; 95% CI: 8.80, 28.15, respectively) when compared to White children. Adjusting for individual-level characteristics, children born in very low COI neighborhoods demonstrated an ARE IR ratio of 1.26 (95% CI: 0.99, 1.59) with a higher incidence of cases among children ages 2 to 4 years and with a parental history of asthma. Rates of ARE were higher among children born in under-resourced communities, and this relationship is strongest for young minoritized children with a parental history of asthma. Higher rates for NHB even in the highest COI categories suggest that risk associated with race persists regardless of social disadvantage."

The return of genetic data was not offered at baseline, but in 2023, we sent invitations to participants for consent to return of actionable genetic findings. We generated exome sequence data from 4,198 participants and used the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) v.3.2 list of 81 genes, ClinVar review, and pathogenicity status, plus manual curation, to develop a pipeline to identify potentially actionable variants. We identified 104 individuals (2.5%) with 108 actionable genotypes at 39 variants in 23 genes and validated these. Working with the NHS Clinical Genetics service, which provided genetic counseling and clinical verification of the research results, and after expert clinical review, we notified 64 consenting participants (or their next of kin) of their actionable genotypes. Ten actionable variants across seven genes (BRCA1, BRCA2, ATP7B, TTN, KCNH2, MUTYH, and GAA) have risen 50- to >3,000-fold in frequency through genetic drift in ancestral island localities. Viking Genes is one of the first UK research cohorts to return actionable findings, providing an ethical and logistical exemplar of return of results. The genetic structure in the Northern Isles of Scotland with multiple founder effects provides a unique opportunity for a tailored approach to disease prevention through genetic screening."

PRDM14 resets and maintains the pluripotent state in normal cells, but the molecular mechanisms through which PRDM14 drives oncogenesis are poorly understood. Here, we interrogated the heterogeneity of Prdm14-expressing cells in a T cell lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma mouse model. Using mass cytometry (CyTOF) of bone marrow at a pre-leukemic timepoint, an unexpected abnormal progenitor B cell population was identified. Prdm14-expressing progenitor B cells demonstrated short-term self-renewal and a block in differentiation when transferred to syngeneic hosts. Consistently, aged host mice succumb to a highly penetrant B-LL. Single-cell RNA-seq analyses suggests that the expression signature of these pre-leukemia cells is more consistent with that of B-1 cells than B-2 cells. B-1 cells are a self-renewing population of unconventional B cells established during embryonic development. Overlaying the chromatin binding of transcriptional marks H3K4me1 and H3K4me3 with PRDM14 suggests that PRDM14 initiates cancers through promiscuous DNA binding, activating oncogenic pathways and skewing development towards a self-renewing B-1-like phenotype. Together, our data show that Prdm14 can initiate premature T and B cell cancer programs when expressed in hematopoietic progenitor cells."

    "abstract": "Copper deficiency peripheral neuropathy caused by excessive treatment in Wilson's disease has been reported. But its pathological characteristics are rarely reported. Here, we report a case of copper deficiency peripheral neuropathy in Wilson's disease and present the characteristics of its nerve biopsy. A 44-year-old female patient diagnosed with Wilson's disease was on long-term oral administration of zinc gluconate and copper chelators. In June 2022, she developed symptoms of peripheral neuropathy, accompanied by anemia and neutropenia. The 24-hour urinary copper excretion was 53.85 Âµg. Serum copper was 66.6 Âµg/L, and ceruloplasmin was 0.01 g/L. Electromyography showed length-dependent axonal damage in peripheral nerves. Sural nerve biopsy showed mainly axonal damage and decreased density of nerve fibres of all classes (large and small myelinated and unmyelinated), accompanied by demyelination. Ultimately, the diagnosis of copper deficiency peripheral neuropathy caused by excessive treatment of Wilson's disease was established. After discontinuing copper chelation therapy, she experienced mild alleviation of symptoms. The pathological features of copper deficiency peripheral neuropathy in Wilson's disease include the formation of axonal vacuoles, the presence of myelin ovoids, and a reduced number of large and small myelinated and unmyelinated nerve fibers. This case emphasizes the importance of monitoring copper metabolism during the stable phase of treatment for patients with Wilson's disease."

    "title": "[Acute Liver Failure].",
    "abstract": "Acute liver failure (ALF) is a severe, potentially reversible form of liver insufficiency, which is defined by the occurrence of hepatic coagulopathy and hepatic encephalopathy in patients with no previous hepatic disease. Acute liver failure is preceded by severe acute liver injury (ALI) with an increase in transaminases, jaundice, and deterioration in general condition over a period of hours to weeks. Every year 200-500 people develop ALF in Germany, most frequently on the background of toxic liver injury (e.g. drug induced liver injury). Other potential causes include viral infections (e.g. hepatitis A and B), autoimmune hepatitis, Budd-Chiari Syndrome or Wilson's disease. Patients usually present at the stage of acute liver damage. Initial diagnostics should include a detailed medical history, clinical examination, laboratory diagnostics and abdominal sonography. The course of acute liver failure is very difficult to predict, so all patients with severe acute liver damage should be evaluated for transfer to a center. At the latest when hepatic encephalopathy occurs and thus when all the definition criteria of acute liver failure are met, the patient should be transferred to a liver transplant center immediately. While specific medical therapies may be available in the early stages of the disease, depending on the etiology, the focus in advanced stages is on preventing complications and treating associated organ dysfunctions. In progressive cases, liver transplantation is often the only life-saving measure. Overall, the mortality rate in Germany is 47%, and approximately 8% of annual liver transplants in the European Union are performed due to ALF."

Similarly, metabolic diseases, such as obesity and diabetes, are also associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer's Disease. As the metabolic landscape shifts during gut inflammation, and gut inflammation in turn impacts metabolic processes, we explore how these interconnected pathways may contribute to the progression of Alzheimer's Disease. Additionally, we discuss the role of bacterial amyloids produced by gut microbes, which may exacerbate amyloid aggregation in the brain and contribute to neurodegenerative processes. Furthermore, we highlight potential therapeutic strategies aimed at reducing gut inflammation, improving metabolic health, and decreasing amyloid content as a means to mitigate Alzheimer's Disease progression. These approaches, targeting the gut-brain-metabolic axis, could offer promising avenues for delaying or preventing cognitive decline in affected individuals."

Overexpression of HIF-1Î± is associated with abnormal placental trophoblast invasion and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. We evaluated the putative association between polymorphisms and haplotypes in parental and child HIF-1Î± genes and the risk of severe-spectrum hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. Case (N = 179) and control (N = 34) mother-father-child triads were recruited by an internet-based method. Cases were defined as HELLP (Hemolysis, Elevated Liver enzymes and Low Platelets) syndrome or pre-eclampsia with severe features. Four HIF-1Î± single nucleotide polymorphisms were genotyped: rs4902080, rs2057492, rs11549465, rs10144958. Relative risks and 95% confidence intervals were estimated using log-linear free response models, adjusting for correlation between familial genotypes. Relative risk of severe-spectrum hypertensive disorder of pregnancy was increased with double-dose carriage of the T allele for SNP rs4902080 in both mother [RR 6.96, p = 0.028] and child [RR 5.77, p = 0.031]. Child double-dose of the T allele for SNP rs10144958 [RR 5.52, p = 0.047] also increased risk. The heterozygous genotype (CT) for SNPs rs2057482 and rs11549465 was protective against hypertensive disorders of pregnancy when carried by mother [rs2057482: RR 0.34, p < 0.001; rs11549465: RR 0.23, p < 0.001] or child [rs2057482: RR 0.44, p < 0.001; rs11549465: RR 0.31, p < 0.001]. A single copy of the C-c-c-G haplotype (rs4902080-rs2057482-rs11549465-rs10144958, N = 147), conferred decreased risk versus the C-T-T-G haplotype in mother [RR 0.28, p < 0.001] and child [RR 0.36, p < 0.001]. No parent-of-origin effects were seen. We conclude that polymorphism changes and haplotypes in the HIF-1Î± gene of mothers, fathers, and children are associated with risk for severe-spectrum hypertensive disorders of pregnancy."

Copper deficiency is associated with multiple diseases, such as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and Wilson's disease. Therapeutic programs targeting copper supply are prospectively employed for disease intervention. Herein, we developed biofriendly copper ionophores (<b>HQFs</b>) by constructing pseudonatural flavonols, which possess flavonoid bioactivity and enhanced copper transport properties. In cell models and mice, we found that <b>HQF</b>-mediated copper delivery synergistically, safely, and efficiently intervened in the development of fatty liver. Mechanistically, NAFLD remission involves fatty acid metabolism, anti-inflammatory processes, and pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) enhancement. Our work is the first to propose the utilization of synergistic copper loading and flavonoid activity for NAFLD intervention, which may inform the clinical management of liver disease."

Materials and Methods Retrospective review of 45-70-year-old patients who underwent DE PA and lateral chest radiography between March 1, 2021, and June 30, 2021, and also underwent noncontrast chest CT scan within 3 years. Following instruction of DE principles and the appearance of CAC, seven readers interpreted the DE chest radiographs to state if CAC was possibly present, definitely present, or not present; estimate ordinal CAC score; and report imaging clues present. Results Ninety-nine patients were selected (mean age, 58.6 years; 53 male and 46 female patients). Among the 62 patients with CAC, the median score was 92. The median CAC score among seven readers when detected ranged from 120 to 203 and when not detected ranged from 18.9 to 39. Among all readers, sensitivity ranged from 71% to 84% in detecting CAC as possibly or definitely present with a specificity range of 54%-92%, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve range was 0.767 to 0.906. The interreader agreement Îº statistic ranged from 0.488 to 0.750. Conclusion DE lateral chest radiographs demonstrated CAC better than DE PA radiographs, with relatively high accuracy and with moderate and substantial interreader agreement. Preclinical detection of CAC presents an opportunity for early intervention in coronary atherosclerotic disease, which may be augmented by machine learning tools. <b>Keywords:</b> Dual Energy Chest Radiography, Lateral Chest Radiography, Lateral Chest X-ray Coronary Calcium, Coronary Calcium Screening, Coronary Calcium Detection <i>Supplemental material is available for this article.</i> Â© RSNA, 2025."

    "abstract": "This paper outlines the implementation of opt-out HIV and Hepatitis C (HCV) screening at a syringe services program (SSP) in Florida, highlighting its effectiveness in reducing the transmission of these infectious diseases. Historically, many SSPs have utilized opt-in testing models, which require participants to actively choose testing and often result in low participation rates. Recognizing the need for a more effective approach and to comply with Florida's regulatory requirements under the Infectious Disease Elimination Act, we transitioned to an opt-out testing model at our SSP. This model integrates routine, anonymous, and voluntary testing into standard care, normalizing the process and reducing stigma associated with infectious disease screening. Initially, our policy tied testing to access to specific services, including syringe exchange, to meet compliance with Florida Department of Health mandates. However, after feedback from participants, staff, and community members, we revised our approach to allow all participants to access all services, regardless of their decision to participate in testing. Importantly, this policy change did not decrease testing rates, with only 6 out of 226 new enrollments (3%) opting out since the implementation of opt-out screening. By fostering a trusting, non-coercive environment and normalizing screening as part of routine care, we achieved high rates of participation while maintaining participant autonomy. Since transitioning to an opt-out model, we have conducted nearly 3,000 HIV and HCV tests, with seropositivity rates of 3.8% and 54%, respectively. These efforts have facilitated early detection, rapid linkage to care, and reduced transmission within the community. Our findings underscore the importance of comprehensive, repeat testing in high-risk populations and demonstrate the potential for opt-out models to serve as a scalable framework for SSPs nationwide. This approach not only fulfills regulatory and public health objectives but also strengthens the role of SSPs as critical interventions in combating HIV and HCV transmission."

    "abstract": "In this study, the role of phosphorylation in the liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of tau, the underlying driving forces, and the potential implications of this separation on protein conformation and subsequent protein aggregation were investigated. We compared in vivo-produced phosphorylated tau (p-tau) and nonphosphorylated tau under different coacervation conditions without adding crowding agents. Our findings revealed that spontaneous phase separation occurs exclusively in p-tau, triggered by a temperature shift from 4 Â°C to room temperature, and is driven by electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. The p-tau self-acervation is reversible with temperature changes. Native mass spectrometry detects only two to nine phosphate groups per p-tau molecule, highlighting the impact of phosphorylation on tau's structural flexibility. Cross-linking mass spectrometry showed fewer long-range contacts in p-tau, suggesting a looser conformation induced by phosphorylation. Phosphorylation-induced LLPS and RNA-induced LLPS occurred at different timeframes. However, neither tau nor p-tau formed fibrils without the addition of dextran sulfate or RNA as inducers. Using human kidney epithelial cells expressing the tau R domain fused with fluorescent proteins as reporter cells, we observed aggregates in the nuclear envelope (NE) only in the cells treated with LLPS-state p-tau, which correlates with NE occurrences reported in Alzheimer's disease brain sections. These findings provide deeper insights into the impact of phosphorylation on tau aggregation through an intermediate condensation phase, offering novel perspectives on neurodegenerative disease mechanisms."

In a statewide radiation oncology quality consortium, we sought to evaluate the impact of IMRT versus 3D-CRT treatment technique on dosimetry and toxicity. From 2012 to 2022, 1746 LA-NSCLC patients meeting inclusion criteria underwent definitive RT (90% CRT) with either 3D-CRT (n = 313) or IMRT (n = 1433) and were enrolled in the Michigan Radiation Oncology Quality Consortium (MROQC) prospective, multicenter statewide initiative. Physician reported toxicity and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) were collected during treatment through 6 months after RT and compared by treatment technique. Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) was used to account for differences in prognostic factors between IMRT and 3D-CRT patients. Compared with 3D-CRT patients, IMRT patients had significantly larger PTVs (median 386 cc vs 292 cc; P < .0001) and were more likely to have Stage IIIB disease (34.3% vs 23.0%; P < .0001). After adjustment using IPTW, treatment with IMRT compared with 3D-CRT reduced high dose to the lung (mean V30 Gy 17.9% vs 19.2%; P = .027) and heart (proportion with V40 Gy â¥ 20% 6.4% vs 15.3%; P < .0001). In logistic regression models using IPTW, through 6 months of early follow-up, there were no significant differences between 3D-CRT and IMRT in rates of grade 2+ acute esophagitis (odds ratio [OR] = 1.02; 95% CI, 0.73,1.42; P = .91) and grade 2+ early pneumonitis (OR = 1.62; 95% CI, 0.89, 2.96; P = .11) or in likelihood of a clinically significant decline in PROs. With late follow-up ongoing, this study supports the continued preferential use of IMRT over 3D-CRT for LA-NSCLC treatment due to improvements in heart and lung doses."

    "abstract": "Prior studies have failed to demonstrate clinical or statistical difference in fecal incontinence (FI) symptom improvement with neuromodulation by percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation vs sham. The results of these studies may be indicative of a placebo or sham effect and led us to investigate possible genetic biomarkers of placebo response among women with FI. To evaluate the relationship between response to percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation or sham and genetic polymorphisms associated with placebo response in women with FI. Findings were validated using an independent cohort of women treated for urgency urinary incontinence with sacral neuromodulation. Blood specimens were utilized from a subset of women in the Neuromodulation for Accidental Bowel Leakage trial who provided blood samples and consented to their use in future studies (N=96). DNA was extracted and genotyping was performed on single nucleotide polymorphisms (previously associated with placebo response in the following genes: catechol-O-methyltransferase, tryptophan hydroxylase-2, brain-derived neurotropic factor, fatty acid amide hydrolase, mu-opiod receptors. An additive linear regression interaction model adjusted for body mass index, race, baseline fecal incontinence episodes or St. Mark's score was used to identify single nucleotide polymorphism by treatment interaction effects significantly associated with change from baseline in St. Mark's score after a 12-week intervention and secondary outcomes. In the absence of significant interaction, single nucleotide polymorphism main effects were tested. Replication of the findings was assessed with an independent cohort of women participating in a randomized trial of urgency urinary incontinence sacral neuromodulation vs onabotulinumtoxinA for treatment of urgency urinary incontinence. There were no differences in age, body mass index, fecal incontinence episodes, or St. Mark's score at baseline or follow-up between percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (n=64) vs sham (n=32) participants. There was a significant interaction (P<.1) between the catechol-O-methyltransferase single nucleotide polymorphism and treatment group for improvement in St. Mark's score (interaction P=.02), improvement in fecal incontinence episodes (interaction P=.01), and Patient Global Impression of Improvement (interaction P=.06). Percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation treated participants with the catechol-O-methyltransferase Met allele had the greatest improvements (St. Mark's score improvement: 1.72, 95% confidence interval=[-0.04 to 3.49], P=.06; fecal incontinence episode improvement: 2.36 episodes per week, 95% confidence interval=[0.97-3.75], P=.001; and Patient Global Impression of Improvement: odds ratio (OR)=2.00; 95% confidence interval=[0.96-4.14], P=.06). There was no association between catechol-O-methyltransferase and treatment response in sham treated participants. No significant interaction or main effects were observed for other single nucleotide polymorphisms. In an independent study of urinary incontinence, there were positive significant associations for Patient Global Impression of Improvement urinary leak (OR 2.41, 95% confidence interval =[1.27-4.55], P=.007) and Patient Global Impression of Improvement bladder function (OR 2.10, 95% confidence interval =[1.10-4.01], P=.03 with the Met allele in women treated with sacral neuromodulation . No association was seen in the onabotulinumtoxinA group. Unexpectedly, women who were homozygous for the catechol-O-methyltransferase Met allele (Met/Met) had a significantly higher likelihood of responding to FI treatment via neuromodulation by percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation, but not to sham treatment. This finding was confirmed in a separate study, which found that UI treatment response to neuromodulation by sacral neuromodulation was significantly more likely in women with the catechol-O-methyltransferase Met allele (Met/Met) genotype."

Understanding the cellular metabolism of osteoclasts (OCs) is key to developing new treatments for osteoporosis, a disease that affects over 200 million women worldwide per annum. We found that human OC differentiation from peripheral blood mononuclear cells derived from 8 female patients is featured with a distinct gene expression profile of mitochondrial biogenesis. Elevated mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP, ÎÏm) was also observed in receptor activator of NF-ÎºB ligand (RANKL)-induced OCs. Interestingly, the gene pathways of heme synthesis and metabolism were activated upon RANKL stimulation, featured by transcriptomic profiling in murine cells at a single-cell resolution, which revealed a stepwise expression pattern of heme-related genes. The real-world human data also divulges potential links between heme-related genes and bone mineral density. Heme is known to have a role in the formation of functional mitochondrial complexes that regulate MMP. Disruption of heme biosynthesis via genetically silencing Ferrochelatase or a selective inhibitor, N-methyl Protoporphyrin IX (NMPP), demonstrated potent inhibition of OC differentiation, with a dose-dependent effect observed in NMPP treatment and a substantial efficacy even at a single dose. In vivo study further showed the protective effect of NMPP on ovariectomy-induced bone loss in female mice. Collectively, we found that RANKL-mediated signaling regulated mitochondrial formation and heme metabolism to synergistically support osteoclastogenesis. Inhibition of heme synthesis impaired OC formation and reversed excessive bone loss, representing a new therapeutic target for metabolic skeletal disorders."

    "abstract": "Maize lethal necrosis (MLN) is a devastating disease of maize caused by synergy between two viruses: maize chlorotic mottle virus (MCMV) and a potyvirus, often sugarcane mosaic virus (SCMV). Throughout the 2010s, severe MLN outbreaks occurred in East Africa including Kenya, Rwanda, and Ethiopia. Previous studies have shown extensive sequence diversity among SCMV isolates collected from this region. In this study, we assessed how this diversity may alter virulence by screening a panel of maize near isogenic lines containing different combinations of major potyvirus resistance loci with diverse SCMV isolates collected from Rwanda. We discovered that the three isolates tested overcame all three potyvirus resistance loci even when stacked, including one isolate that asymptomatically infected all resistant lines tested. To understand how SCMV virulence may contribute to MLN, each SCMV isolate was co-inoculated with MCMV on a panel of SCMV and MCMV resistant maize lines. No significant differences in MLN severity were observed for the isolates from Rwanda compared to the reference SCMV isolates, indicating that increased virulence in SCMV single infection did not necessarily correlate with increased MLN severity in co-infection with MCMV. At least two potyvirus resistance loci were needed to reduce MLN severity and combining SCMV and MCMV resistance was most effective. Remarkably, in some cases, co-infection with MCMV facilitated SCMV infection of potyvirus resistant lines that SCMV could not infect alone. These results underscore the challenges of developing durable MLN resistance and highlight the importance of incorporating strong, multigenic potyvirus resistance into MLN resistance breeding programs."

We found that for this sample set, bead-based extractions captured longer molecules and yielded a greater proportion of unique reads when aligned to the human genome, than did column and phase-based extraction methods. Via the incorporation of multiple extraction replicates, we quantified the variability in sequencing metrics resulting from tissue sample and extraction technique heterogeneity. Additionally, we compared pre- and post-sequencing metrics and found that the former poorly predicted post-sequencing on-target success.

BECs express low baseline levels of adhesion receptors, which limits entry of leukocytes. However, the molecular mediators governing this phenotype remain mostly unclear. Here, we explored how infiltration of immune cells across the BBB is influenced by the scaffold protein IQ motif containing GTPase-activating protein 2 (IQGAP2). In mice and zebrafish, we demonstrate that loss of Iqgap2 increases infiltration of peripheral leukocytes into the CNS under homeostatic and inflammatory conditions. Using single-cell RNA sequencing and immunohistology, we further show that BECs from mice lacking Iqgap2 exhibit a profound inflammatory signature, including extensive upregulation of adhesion receptors and antigen-processing machinery. Human tissue analyses also reveal that Alzheimer's disease is associated with reduced hippocampal IQGAP2. Overall, our results implicate IQGAP2 as an essential regulator of BBB immune privilege and immune cell entry into the CNS."

To target these tumors, we used chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells with a binder based on mAb806 which recognizes ectopically expressed wild-type EGFR and EGFRvIII. In this open-label phase 1 clinical trial, patients age 1-26 years with EGFR+ CNS tumors received weekly infusions of 1-2.5 x 107 CAR T cells into the tumor resection bed or the lateral ventricle via an implanted catheter. No lymphodepletion was used. Eleven patients were enrolled. Four (3 with high-grade glioma, 1 with atypical teratoid-rhabdoid tumor) were treated and received 5-10 CAR T cell infusions without dose-limiting toxicities. The trial closed prior to reaching planned dose regimens. All treatment-related adverse events were no higher than CTCAE grade 2. The most common were headache and nausea. One patient had a grade 1 seizure, and three had new sensory changes, weakness and/or urinary changes (grade 1-2) that were possibly related to CAR T cell infusion. Three of the four treated patients had progressive disease. One patient with spinal cord diffuse midline glioma had progressive peritumoral edema that could not be conclusively attributed to either progression or pseudoprogression and was therefore defined as stable disease, followed by a complete response to subsequent chemotherapy. Intracranially infused EGFR806-CAR T cells were tolerable at tested doses, with a best response of stable disease. EGFR is a potentially useful target for cellular therapy against pediatric brain tumors, particularly high-grade gliomas."

    "abstract": "Wilson's disease (WD) is a genetic disorder that impairs the excretion of copper in hepatocytes and results in excessive copper deposition in multiple organs. The replacement of disordered hepatocytes with functional hepatocytes can serve as a lifelong therapeutic strategy for the treatment of WD. The aim of this study was to determine the hepatocyte repopulation effects of fibroblast-derived hepatic progenitor cells in the treatment of WD. Induced hepatic progenitor cells (iHPCs) were generated through direct reprogramming of adult mouse fibroblasts infected with lentivirus carrying both the Foxa3 and Hnf4Î± genes. These iHPCs were subsequently identified and transplanted into copper-overload WD mice with the Atp7b (H1071Q) mutation via caudal vein injection. After lentivirus infection, the fibroblasts transformed into Foxa3- and Hnf4Î±-overexpressing cobblestone-like cells with reduced expression of fibroblast markers and increased expression of epithelial cell and hepatic progenitor cell markers, i.e., iHPCs. Sixteen weeks after transplantation into WD mice, approximately 2% of hepatocytes were derived from iHPCs, and these iHPC-derived hepatocytes expressed a tight junction-associated protein of the bile canal, tight junction protein 1 (Zo1). There was a decrease in the serum copper concentration and relative activity of serum ceruloplasmin at weeks 4 and 8 after iHPCs transplantation compared with those of WD fed mice administered saline or fibroblasts. Furthermore, iHPC transplantation markedly reduced the proportion of CD8<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes and natural killer cells compared with those in fibroblast-transplanted WD mice and downregulated the transcription of the inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor Î± (TnfÎ±), interleukin 1Î² (IL-1Î²), and IL-6, compared with those in WD mice and in fibroblast-transplanted WD mice. iHPCs reprogrammed from adult fibroblasts can repopulate hepatocytes and exert therapeutic effects in WD mice, representing a potential replacement therapy for clinical application."

    "title": "Redirecting immune signaling with cytokine adaptors.",
    "abstract": "Cytokines are signaling molecules that coordinate complex immune processes and are frequently dysregulated in disease. While cytokine blockade has become a common therapeutic modality, cytokine agonism has had limited utility due to the widespread expression of cytokine receptors with pleiotropic effects. To overcome this limitation, we devise an approach to engineer molecular switches, termed cytokine adaptors, that transform one cytokine signal into an alternative signal with a different functional output. Endogenous cytokines act to nucleate the adaptors, converting the cytokine-adaptor complex into a surrogate agonist for a different cytokine pathway. In this way, cytokine adaptors, which have no intrinsic agonist activity, can function as conditional, context-dependent agonists. We develop cytokine adaptors that convert IL-10 or TGF-Î² into IL-2 receptor agonists to reverse T cell suppression. We also convert the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-23 or IL-17 into immunosuppressive IL-10 receptor agonists. Thus, we show that cytokine adaptors can convert immunosuppressive cytokines into immunostimulatory cytokines, or vice versa. Unlike other methods of immune conversion that require cell engineering, cytokine adaptors are soluble molecules that leverage endogenous cues from the microenvironment to drive context-specific signaling."

    "abstract": "This study assessed the antibacterial, antibiofilm, and immunomodulatory activity of Lactobacillus acidophilus (strain Scav) postbiotic (LaP) in a mouse model of Pseudomonas aeruginosa wound infection and evaluated the bioactive components of the LaP. LaP was tested for Pseudomonas aeruginosa clearance and immunomodulatory activity during wound infection. We show that LaP applied 1 h after infection reduced tissue bacterial burden within 24 h, and this reduction persisted for 5 days. Ciprofloxacin given once at the exact same time did not reduce bacteria load as compared to vehicle controls. LaP reduced plasma IL-6 and MCP-1 levels after 5 days. Wound tissue IL-6 and MCP-1 levels were increased in infected vehicle mice at 5 days, but tissues from LaP-treated mice were similar to sham controls. LaP increased tissue IL-10 (antiinflammatory cytokine) levels. Ciprofloxacin decreased plasma and tissue IL-6 compared to vehicle controls but did not affect MCP-1 or IL-10 levels. To elucidate antibacterial and antibiofilm metabolite(s) in LaP, fractionation followed by Ps. aeruginosa antagonistic activity assays were performed. This was followed by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LCMS) analysis. Our analyses identified a low molecular weight, polar molecule, which had both antibacterial and antibiofilm activity. Lactobacillus acidophilus secretes an antibacterial and antibiofilm metabolite that reduced pathogen burden and resolved systemic inflammation in a Pseudomonas aeruginosa wound infection model."

    "abstract": "Survival rates after a diagnosis of cancer are improving. Poorly managed gastrointestinal (GI) side effects can interfere with delivery of curative cancer treatment. Long-term physical side effects of cancer therapy impinge on quality of life in up to 25% of those treated for cancer, and GI side effects are the most common and troublesome. To provide comprehensive, practical guidance on the management of acute and chronic luminal gastrointestinal symptoms arising during and after treatment for cancer METHODS: A multidisciplinary expert group including patients treated for cancer, divided into working parties to identify, and synthesise recommendations for the optimal assessment, diagnosis and appropriate interventions for luminal GI side effects of systemic and local cancer therapies. Recommendations were developed using the principles of the BMJ AGREE II reporting. 103 recommendations were agreed. The importance of the patient perspective and what can be done to support patients are emphasised. Key physiological principles underlying the development of GI toxicity arising from cancer therapy are outlined. Individual symptoms or symptom clusters are poor at distinguishing the underlying cause(s), and investigations are required if empirical therapy does not lead rapidly to significant benefits. Patients frequently have multiple GI causes for symptoms; all need to be diagnosed and optimally treated to achieve resolution. Investigations and management approaches now known to be ineffective or of questionable benefit are highlighted. The physical, emotional and financial costs to individuals, their families and society from cancer therapy can be considerable. Identifying and signposting affected patients who require specialist services is the role of all clinicians. Progress in the treatment of cancer increasingly means that patients require expert, multidisciplinary supportive care providing effective and safe treatment at every stage of the cancer journey. Development of such expertise should be prioritised as should the education of health professionals and the public in what, when and how acute and chronic gastrointestinal symptoms and complications should be managed."

    "abstract": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a multisystem disease characterized by persistent lung infection. Treatment with elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI) improves respiratory-related quality of life and reduces rates of infection and antibiotic treatments. Reduced antibiotic use may alter bacterial drug resistance patterns. This was a single center, retrospective, observational study analyzing respiratory cultures obtained from people with CF (pwCF) before and after starting ETI therapy. Antibiotic courses and culture data, including susceptibilities, were obtained from the electronic medical record. There were 312 pwCF on ETI included, with an average age at ETI initiation of 20.9 Â± 12.0 years and an average length of time on ETI 2.48 Â± 0.69 years. Compared to the pre-ETI period, pwCF post-ETI had reductions in the number of antibiotic courses per year (2.5 to 0.7, p < 0.001), antibiotics utilized per course (1.4 to 1.0, p < 0.001), and percentage of courses including intravenous antibiotics (59% to 38%, p < 0.001). The fraction of pwCF with at least one culture positive for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia species, or Stenotrophomonas maltophilia decreased after ETI initiation, though changes were not significant for Staphylococcus aureus. Antibacterial resistance patterns were similar for most antibiotics in pre- and post-ETI periods, with P. aeruginosa exhibiting more resistance to fluoroquinolones post-ETI. Individuals with resistant organisms pre-ETI were less likely to clear the pathogen post-ETI. Treatment with ETI significantly decreased antibiotic utilization and the prevalence of gram-negative organisms. Although fewer antibiotics were used, antibiotic resistance remained unchanged or even increased post-ETI due largely to the greater persistence of resistant organisms."

A European Reference Network (ERN) Transversal Working Group (WG) on Pregnancy and Family Planning was created to join forces to promote and address issues on these topics in rare and low-prevalence diseases. To outline the challenges and the good practices related to pregnancy and family planning in rare and complex diseases for healthcare professionals (HCPs). A survey on state of the art and unmet needs was created by a co-design group of both clinicians and patients' representatives from 20 ERNs. The survey was uploaded in English on the online platform \"EU Survey\" and disseminated by respective ERNs and learned societies. Seven transversal domains were explored in the survey by using closed and open-ended questions: fertility preservation, pre-conceptional counselling, family planning counselling, pre-implantation diagnosis, prenatal diagnosis, pregnancy monitoring and post pregnancy monitoring, lactation monitoring/counselling and newborn management. The questions investigated for each topic were the following: level of importance, activities performed by the centre, clinical challenges, good practice and educational activities. A total of 197 answers were collected from 24 different countries. Unmet needs for HCPs included: the need to improve communication between different HCPs, the lack of predefined organizational pathways, the lack of availability of expert HCPs for some pregnancy-related issues and the need to streamline the care provided among different countries. In addition, the survey underlined the need to improve the educational activities provided to rare disease patients. Physicians and patients need to be educated on the emerged unmet needs in order to standardize the information for both HCPs and patients with rare diseases. Educational activities should be considered to help to disseminate information."

    "abstract": "The serum ceruloplasmin assay is the most commonly used test for diagnosing Wilson's disease (WD). Despite the utility of non-invasive tests for diagnosing WD, no such tests have been developed. Therefore, we aimed to identify a safe and non-invasive assay and determine the factors associated with salivary ceruloplasmin. The sample comprised 167 participants: 130 patients with WD (experimental group) and 37 individuals without WD (control group). Salivary ceruloplasmin's diagnostic performance was assessed using a receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, and the diagnostic thresholds were determined. The Mann-Whitney U test for independent samples was used to compare intergroup variability between the control and WD groups. We used Pearson's correlation coefficient to determine intergroup correlations between the blood and salivary ceruloplasmin levels of patients with WD. Salivary ceruloplasmin levels were significantly lower in the WD group than in the control group. Serum and salivary ceruloplasmin levels were positively correlated. The area under the curve for salivary ceruloplasmin was 0.9977. The critical value of salivary ceruloplasmin was 8.885 ng/mL, with a sensitivity of 99.23% and specificity of 100%. Evidently, salivary ceruloplasmin has substantial diagnostic value. Therefore, saliva analysis can be used as a non-invasive alternative to serum analysis for diagnosing WD."

    "abstract": "Dystrophic neurites (also termed axonal spheroids) are found around amyloid deposits in Alzheimer's disease (AD), where they impair axonal electrical conduction, disrupt neural circuits and correlate with AD severity. Despite their importance, the mechanisms underlying spheroid formation remain incompletely understood. To address this, we developed a proximity labeling approach to uncover the proteome of spheroids in human postmortem and mouse brains. Additionally, we established a human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived AD model enabling mechanistic investigation and optical electrophysiology. These complementary approaches revealed the subcellular molecular architecture of spheroids and identified abnormalities in key biological processes, including protein turnover, cytoskeleton dynamics and lipid transport. Notably, the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, which regulates these processes, was activated in spheroids. Furthermore, phosphorylated mTOR levels in spheroids correlated with AD severity in humans. Notably, mTOR inhibition in iPSC-derived neurons and mice ameliorated spheroid pathology. Altogether, our study provides a multidisciplinary toolkit for investigating mechanisms and therapeutic targets for axonal pathology in neurodegeneration."

The KDIGO CKD Guideline Work Group defined the scope of the guideline and determined topics for systematic review. An independent Evidence Review Team systematically reviewed the evidence and graded the certainty of evidence for each of the review topics. Latest searches of the English-language literature were done in July 2023. Final modification of the guideline was informed by a public review process during summer of 2023 involving registered stakeholders. The full guideline included 28 recommendations and 141 practice points. This synopsis focuses on the recommendations that have the greatest evidence. Practice points reflect the expert opinion of the group where evidence is not that strong. Recommendations include greater emphasis on cystatin C for assessment of glomerular filtration rate, point-of-care testing in remote areas, a shift to an individualized risk-based approach to predict kidney failure, sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors for some patients with CKD with and without diabetes, and statin use for adults older than 50 years and CKD. Together the recommendations and practice points provide guidance for how to evaluate and manage persons with CKD."

    "abstract": "Respiratory infections with multiresistant <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> are a major clinical problem, affecting mainly patients with pre-existing lung diseases such as cystic fibrosis (CF) or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease but also immunocompromised or elderly patients. We have previously shown that sphingosine, which is abundantly present on epithelial cells of the respiratory tract in healthy humans and wild-type mice, but almost undetectable on the surface of epithelial cells of the respiratory tract from CF patients and CF mice, efficiently kills many bacterial species <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. Here, we show that sphingosine very rapidly induces marked changes in the membrane of <i>P. aeruginosa</i> with a rolling of the membrane followed by destruction of the bacteria. Sphingosine induced a degradation of cardiolipin via the maintenance of lipid asymmetry (Mla) system in <i>P. aeruginosa</i>. Degradation of cardiolipin induced by sphingosine is prevented in <i>P. aeruginosa</i> mutants of MlaY and reduced in mutants of MlaZ and MlaA. Mutants of MlaY and MlaZ were resistant to sphingosine-induced death of <i>P. aeruginosa</i>. In summary, our data indicate that sphingosine induces the death of <i>P. aeruginosa</i> by a persisting degradation of cardiolipin by the Mla system leading to severe membrane changes in bacteria, while leaving mammalian cells, devoid of cardiolipin in their plasma membrane, alive."

    "abstract": "The mechanical environment in the hip in people with residual Legg-CalvÃ©-Perthes disease (LCPD) deformity is still poorly understood. Anterior impingement is thought to contribute to poor long-term outcomes such as early-onset osteoarthritis, but it has not been measured directly using imaging in high flexion. Our objective in this study was to determine the association between radiographic morphologic scores of LCPD deformity and reduced anterior hip clearance. We measured the anterior clearance (Î²-angle) of 20 LCPD-affected hips (17 patients) scanned in 4 functional postures using an upright open MRI scanner. Mixed effects models were used to describe the relationship between Î², posture, and morphologic measures of deformity (Stulberg classification and Sphericity Deviation Score). Hip Î²-angle was significantly associated with posture ( P <0.001). Aspherical (Stulberg III to V) hips had lower Î² across all postures compared with spherical (Stulberg I to II) hips (difference in Î² = -39.1 degrees; 95% CI: -71.9 to -6.2 degrees; P =0.020). An increased SDS was strongly associated with reduced Î² in neutral hip postures ( P =0.002, 0.005, respectively), but not with elevated adduction and internal rotation. Due to morphologic heterogeneity, 6 hips (out of 20 overall) did not fit the overall trend. Our results show an association between more severe radiographic deformity and a greater potential for anterior impingement, a known contributor to cartilage degradation. However, the large proportion of cases where morphologic deformity does not align with functional clearance suggests current radiographic measures of deformity may not be sufficient to predict long-term outcomes in every LCPD patient. (1) Hip joint asphericity in LCPD is associated with less anterior clearance and a greater potential for anterior impingement in high flexion postures. (2) Considering both morphologic and functional parameters may improve our understanding of the causes of pain and early-onset osteoarthritisin LCPD, as opposed to morphology alone."

We examined HOXA7 and HOXA9 gene expression in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients with nucleophosmin1 (NPM1) mutation. This study included 91 cases of AML and 23 samples of matched healthy controls. HOXA7 and HOXA9 gene expression was analyzed using real-time PCR with SYBR Green dye. All cases were subjected to NPM1 mutation detection. Both HOXA7 and HOXA9 gene expressions were significantly correlated with age, with adult patients exhibiting substantially higher gene expression than pediatric patients (p < 0.01). Both HOXA7 and HOXA9 high gene expressions were significantly associated with NPM1 mutation (p = 0.032 and p = 0.001, respectively). Adult patients with AML demonstrated a higher level of HOXA9 expression, which has a negative impact on the disease-free survival of NPM1-mutated patients (p = 0.055). Therefore, targeting the HOXA9 pathway presents a highly plausible treatment option for NPM1-mutated adult AML patients."

    "abstract": "As global warming intensifies, the healthcare industry faces a parallel need to treat climate-related illness and scrutinize our greenhouse gas emissions. Metered-dose inhaler medications for reactive airways diseases constitute a substantial portion of healthcare emissions. Metered-dose inhalers are often overprescribed, underlabeled, and lost after a few actuations in the emergency department (ED). Lower greenhouse gas alternatives of similar cost and efficacy are readily available, such as dry-powder inhalers, and numerous guidelines support practice change, yet no published work has shown attempts to change practice patterns in the ED. This quality improvement initiative sought to improve inhaler prescribing, use, and disposal in our ED through a staff education campaign. In a tertiary care ED, we implemented a two-staged education campaign for ED nurses and doctors. Passive education techniques (posters, emails, presentations) were followed by active education (one-on-one sessions, simulated cases). Objectives included improvement of green-prescribing practices, medication labeling, patient education, proper disposal, and pulmonary function testing prior to prescribing. We encouraged practice change only in mild and moderate cases of reactive airway disease. We showed a 19% reduction over the first 6 months, and a 43% reduction the following 6 months in salbutamol metered-dose inhaler dispensations, relative to the same period the year prior. This may correspond to the carbon equivalent of driving approximately 96,000 km by car, or nearly 2.5 times the Earth's circumference. Process measures revealed increased dispensations of dry-powder inhalers and a quick improvement in prescriber knowledge and comfort with alternatives. Overburdened ED staff remain willing and able to change practice toward environmental sustainability. The rapid success of this project should encourage expansion of sustainability considerations across Canadian EDs, and into clinical and administrative decision-making at all levels of healthcare."

    "abstract": "Breast cancer patients are at increased risk of cardiovascular disease, which often are associated with cardiotoxic breast cancer treatment or overlapping risk factors between the two diseases. Pre-treatment cardiovascular risk assessment can enable accurate risk stratification and prevention of cardiovascular disease. Several tools have been suggested, described or used in research to assess baseline (pre-treatment) risk to determine appropriate cardiovascular disease care before, during and after cancer treatment. This scoping review aims to identify and describe key features of baseline cardiovascular disease risk assessment tools for breast cancer patients. PubMed, Embase and Google Scholar were searched for articles published January 2013 - March 2024 to identify publications reporting cardiovascular disease risk assessment tools in breast cancer patients. Publications included research articles (observational and experimental studies) and position/policy, commentary and review papers. Eligibility was assessed and key data were extracted independently by two reviewers. Conflicts were discussed and resolved with the authorship team. A total 144 articles were identified. Of these, 57 reported original data for the development, validation or recommendations of cardiovascular disease risk assessment tools and 87 reported the use of such tools. From these articles, 13 tools were identified that assessed the risk of cardiovascular disease broadly (n = 3) or death due to cardiovascular disease (n = 1) or specifically of cardiotoxicity or heart failure (n = 8) or venous thromboembolism (n = 1) in people diagnosed with breast cancer. Fourteen tools assessed cardiovascular disease risk in people diagnosed with mixed cancer types, including breast cancer. The planned development of four tools and/or surveillance pathways were described in protocol papers. Among all these tools identified (n = 31), seven tools (among these, four tools assessed people diagnosed with breast cancer only) went through external validation and performed poorly or moderately in stratifying cancer patients effectively into risk categories. Risk factors included in the assessment tools were age, breast cancer treatment type and pre-existing cardiovascular disease. While clinical guidelines and recommendations about baseline cardiovascular disease risk assessment were identified, these were either for cancer patients broadly or for cancer treatment types, and not specifically for people diagnosed with breast cancer. Several tools to assess baseline cardiovascular disease in people diagnosed with breast cancer were identified but only seven tools had gone through a validation process, and none were found to be very effective in differentiating people by baseline cardiovascular disease risk. Further work is needed to optimise the effectiveness of baseline cardiovascular disease risk assessments for breast cancer patients to enable appropriate stratification and monitoring of risk before, during and after treatment to improve cardiovascular health and outcomes."

Characterizing neurological findings that commonly present among patients with PANS could improve diagnostic accuracy. To evaluate the prevalence of neurological soft signs (NSSs) that may be associated with basal ganglia dysfunction among youths presenting with PANS and assess whether clinical characteristics of PANS correlate with NSSs that may be associated with basal ganglia dysfunction. This cohort study included 135 new patients who met strict PANS criteria and were evaluated at the Stanford Children's Immune Behavioral Health Clinic between November 1, 2014, and March 1, 2020. Data on these patients were retrospectively reviewed between December 13, 2020, and September 25, 2023. Sixteen patients were excluded because they had no neurological examination within the first 3 visits and within 3 months of clinical presentation. Statistical analysis was conducted between September 26, 2023, and November 22, 2024. The following NSSs that may be associated with basal ganglia dysfunction were recorded from medical record review: (1) glabellar tap reflex, (2) tongue movements, (3) milkmaid's grip, (4) choreiform movements, (5) spooning, and (6) overflow movements. Data from prospectively collected symptoms and impairment scales (Global Impairment Score [GIS; score range, 1-100, with higher scores indicating greater impairment] and Caregiver Burden Inventory [score range, 0-96, with higher scores indicating greater caregiver burden]) were included. The study included 119 patients; the mean (SD) age at PANS onset was 8.2 (3.6) years, the mean (SD) age at initial presentation was 10.4 (3.6) years, and 66 (55.5%) were boys. At least 1 NSS that may be associated with basal ganglia dysfunction was observed in 95 patients (79.8%); the mean (SD) number of NSSs was 2.1 (1.6). Patients with 4 or more NSSs had higher GISs (mean [SD] score, 56.0 [22.6] vs 40.6 [26.7]; P = .05) and more symptoms (mean [SD] number, 15.1 [4.9] vs 11.5 [4.2]; P = .008) than patients with 0 NSSs. There was no significant difference in age at visit or in Caregiver Burden Inventory score. On Poisson and linear regression, the number of NSSs was associated with global impairment, with 1 more sign increasing the GIS by 2.86 (95% CI, 0.09-5.62; P = .04), and with the number of symptoms, with 1 more sign increasing the number of symptoms by 5% (1.05; 95% CI, 1.02-1.08; P = .002), but not with age or duration of PANS at presentation. This cohort study of patients with PANS found a high prevalence of NSSs that may be associated with basal ganglia dysfunction and an association between these NSSs and disease severity that was not associated with younger age. PANS may have a unique profile, suggesting that targeted neurological examinations may support PANS diagnosis."

The aim was to assess the cost-utility of Haemate-P compared with present alternatives in the treatment of vWD in Spain. A Markov model was developed in Microsoft Excel to estimate the cost-effectiveness of various treatments for vWD over a lifetime horizon. Transition probabilities among health states were based on age and number of bleeding events. Treatment strategies compared included Haemate-P, Fanhdi, and Wilate in long-term prophylaxis (LTP) or on-demand treatment (ODT). Costs and quality-of-life were measured based on patient age, treatment, and number of bleeding events incurred. Both costs and utilities were discounted at 3%. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. When comparing LTP regimens, Haemate-P was less costly and numerically more effective than both Fanhdi (incremental costs = -â¬1,313,845; incremental quality-adjusted life-years [QALY] = 0.13) and Wilate (incremental costs = -â¬2,233,940; incremental QALY = 0.29). For ODT, Haemate-P was assumed to have equal effectiveness as Fanhdi and Wilate but reduced the costs by â¬696,857 and â¬1,145,780, respectively. Haemate-P prophylaxis was more effective and less costly compared with Haemate-P on-demand in the base case (incremental costs = -â¬633,317; incremental QALY = 0.90). Results were generally robust to sensitivity analyses. In patients with severe vWD experiencing a high bleed rate, Haemate-P prophylaxis is a less costly and potentially more effective treatment strategy and Haemate-P is cost-saving among on-demand strategies."

Here, we meta-analyzed genome and exome sequencing data from 36 studies that included 52,416 AF cases and 277,762 controls. In burden tests of rare coding variation, we identified novel associations between AF and the genes MYBPC3, LMNA, PKP2, FAM189A2 and KDM5B. We further identified associations between AF and rare structural variants owing to deletions in CTNNA3 and duplications of GATA4. We broadly replicated our findings in independent samples from MyCode, deCODE and UK Biobank. Finally, we found that CRISPR knockout of KDM5B in stem-cell-derived atrial cardiomyocytes led to a shortening of the action potential duration and widespread transcriptomic dysregulation of genes relevant to atrial homeostasis and conduction. Our results highlight the contribution of rare coding and structural variants to AF, including genetic links between AF and cardiomyopathies, and expand our understanding of the rare variant architecture for this common arrhythmia."

We observed a marked increase in chromatin accessibility for our sentinel variants and prioritized genes in atrial cardiomyocytes. Finally, a polygenic risk score (PRS) based on our updated effect estimates improved AF risk prediction compared to the CHARGE-AF clinical risk score and a previously reported PRS for AF. The doubling of known risk loci will facilitate a greater understanding of the pathways underlying AF."

Therefore, the objectives of this research were (1) to determine the competencies needed by dairy farm workers to implement antimicrobial stewardship and to inform educational resource development and (2) explore the farm contexts that influence farm worker antimicrobial stewardship capabilities. Initially, focus group discussions were conducted in person with 6 groups of veterinarians at 3 independent conferences held in the United States. To gain additional perspectives, 2 focus groups were conducted via video link with dairy producers from the midwestern United States. The focus groups had 4 to 8 participants and 2 to 4 facilitators each, and were audio recorded and transcribed for analysis. Discussions were audio recorded, transcribed, and evaluated using inductive thematic analysis, with 9 key themes identified. Participants emphasized that farm workers needed to be willing to learn, to be responsible, and to be consistent in their execution of tasks. Furthermore, farm workers needed knowledge about the rationale behind antimicrobial use strategies and disease mitigation practices. General skills needed by farm workers included good communication, excellent observation, and the ability to follow protocols and keep records. Technical skills required by farm workers related to the handling of animals, attention to cleanliness, ability to properly administer pharmaceutical products, and farm equipment maintenance. The skills and knowledge required differed among farm workers depending on their responsibilities and experience, with greater expectations for herd managers compared with employees who specialized in a specific task such as milking. Farm contexts that affected antimicrobial stewardship included the farm size, which had an impact on the 3 other themes: workplace culture, leadership, and tools. Workplace culture encompassed having an approachable environment and clear responsibilities, and leadership encompassed managerial capacity and veterinary support. Important tools for effective antimicrobial stewardship included relevant and up-to-date protocols, technology, equipment, and a proficient workforce. The evidence provided through these focus groups is useful for informing competency-based educational efforts aimed at improving antimicrobial stewardship on dairy farms."

    "abstract": "The association of scam susceptibility with the timing of Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia onset is unknown. One thousand ninety-two older adults without dementia underwent assessments of scam susceptibility and annual clinical evaluations to document incident AD dementia. Accelerated failure time models examined the relation of scam susceptibility with dementia onset. During a mean of 5 years of follow-up (standard deviation = 3.1), 188 individuals (17%) were diagnosed with incident AD dementia. A higher level of scam susceptibility was associated with a considerably earlier dementia onset ( <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mi>Î²</mi> <annotation>$\\beta $</annotation></semantics> </math> = -0.039; 95% confidence interval: -0.061, -0.017); those with a high level of susceptibility developed AD dementia at a mean age of 90.9 years compared to 98.2 for those with a low level. Results persisted after controlling for global cognition, sex, and education. Scam susceptibility is associated with a markedly earlier onset of AD dementia. Assessment of susceptibility may facilitate early identification of individuals at risk of developing dementia. We examined whether scam susceptibility among older adults is associated with an accelerated onset of Alzheimer's disease dementia. Participants came from a large ongoing cohort study of aging. Scam susceptibility was assessed using a validated measure. Scam susceptibility was associated with a marked acceleration in dementia onset. Assessment of susceptibility may facilitate early identification of dementia."

    "abstract": "There have been several recent reports of Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) due to isolates with reduced fidaxomicin susceptibility (minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC] â¥ 2 Âµg/mL). However, the clinical implications are uncertain because fidaxomicin achieves high concentrations in the intestinal tract. In an acute care hospital, we conducted a 3-year cohort study of patients with CDI to determine the frequency of infection with isolates with reduced fidaxomicin susceptibility and the impact on response to fidaxomicin treatment. Stool specimens were cultured for C. difficile, and susceptibility testing was performed using agar dilution. Whole-genome sequencing was used to identify mutations associated with reduced fidaxomicin susceptibility and to determine relatedness of isolates. For genomically related susceptible and reduced susceptibility isolates from the same patient, we compared rates of growth, sporulation, and toxin production. Of 108 fidaxomicin-treated patients, 6 (5.6%) were infected with isolates that possessed reduced fidaxomicin susceptibility (MICs 8-32 Âµg/mL), including 3 with initially susceptible isolates followed by clinical failure with subsequent recovery of genomically related isolates with reduced susceptibility. Isolates with reduced fidaxomicin susceptibility harbored mutations in RNA polymerase associated with reduced susceptibility and exhibited reduced toxin production, and 20% to 40% of isolates tested had reduced growth and/or sporulation in comparison with susceptible isolates. Three patients were infected with genomically indistinguishable ribotype 097 isolates with reduced fidaxomicin susceptibility. Our findings highlight the potential for the emergence on therapy of clinically relevant reduced fidaxomicin susceptibility in C. difficile and its spread via transmission to other patients."

    "abstract": "Environmental enrichment is the provision of different substrates to mimic an animal's natural environment and encourage natural, species-specific behavior. However, the use of enrichment to improve breeding efficiency in mouse models for neurologic conditions is not well described. There are reports that diminished environmental stimuli and chronic isolation can result in the early expression of the Parkinson phenotype in mice with a genetic predisposition to the disease. In this study, we compared the provision of crinkle paper, DietGel, and their combination on reproductive parameters in B6.Cg-Tg(THY1-SNCA*A53T)M53Sud mice. We found that enhanced enrichment combined with enhanced nutrition increased dam weight and decreased the interlitter intervals. In addition, enhanced enrichment increased the production index, number of pups born, pups weaned, and the percent survival of pups. This study underscores the importance of incorporating enrichment to enhance the reproductive parameters in mice that are models of Parkinson disease."

    "abstract": "Delirium is a neurologic syndrome characterized by inattention and cognitive impairment frequently encountered in the medically ill. Peripheral inflammation is a key trigger of delirium, but the patient-specific immune responses associated with delirium development and resolution are unknown. This retrospective cohort study of prospectively collected biospecimens examines RNA sequencing from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of adults hospitalized for COVID-19 to better understand patient-specific factors associated with delirium (n = 64). Longitudinal transcriptomic analyses highlight persistent immune dysregulation in delirium, marked by increasing expression trajectories of genes linked to innate immune pathways, including complement activation, cytokine production, and monocyte/macrophage recruitment. Genes involved adaptive immunity showed a declining trajectory over time in patients with delirium. Although corticosteroid treatment suppressed some aspects of immune hyperactivation, aberrant responses contributing to delirium were exacerbated. Delirium resolution was characterized by normalization of key transcripts such as <i>CCL2</i> and innate immune markers. Novel associations with delirium were found in genes related to stress granule assembly and <i>DUSP2</i> and <i>KLF10</i>, which mediate T-cell responses. These findings provide insights into the peripheral immune responses accompanying delirium and their modulation by corticosteroids. Future trials targeting aberrant inflammatory responses may mitigate the severe outcomes associated with delirium due to COVID19."

In this study, we performed GWAS analyses of coronary heart disease (CHD) or all-cause stroke in African (AFR) and European (EUR) American participants with CKD of the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC). Mixed- effect logistic regression models were race-stratified and adjusted for age, sex, site of recruitment, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and principal components, followed by meta-analysis. We attempted replication in participants from two biobanks with biomarker or ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision) diagnostic codes for CKD. We assessed the association of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) at known CHD and stroke loci in CRIC and tested the genetic correlation among CRIC, a biobank-based cohort and published GWAS of cardiovascular disease. Among 3,588 CRIC participants, 1,203 had CHD and 535 had all-cause stroke. We identified six SNVs across three loci ( <i>LINC02744</i> , <i>AZIN1- AS1</i> , and <i>ATP6V0A4</i> ) associated with all-cause stroke, and two intronic SNVs at the <i>PPARG</i> locus associated with CHD. However, SNV associations were not significant in replication studies. Published SNVs for CHD or stroke were not associated with cardiovascular outcomes in CRIC. When testing the genetic correlations between published GWAS and CRIC GWAS, they were significant for CHD (genetic correlations (rg) range of 0.39 to 0.51, <i>p-value<</i> 0.007). These findings suggest some differences in the genetic architecture of CHD and stroke among individuals with CKD compared to those from the general population, although large numbers of CKD participants are needed to assess if findings are related to participant selection and CKD severity, or non-traditional risk factors in people with CKD."

    "abstract": "Identification of at-risk individuals who would benefit from early intervention for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) is critical as new treatments are developed. Measures of retinal health could offer accessible and low-cost indication of pre-morbid disease risk, but their association with ADRD risk is unknown. To determine whether midlife retinal neuronal and microvascular measures are associated with ADRD risk-index scores and individual domains of ADRD risk. Data were from the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study, a population-representative longitudinal New Zealand-based birth cohort study. 94.1% (N = 938) of living Study members were seen at age 45 (2017-2019). Retinal neuronal (retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (GC-IPL)) and microvascular (arterioles and venules) measures were used as predictors. Outcome measures were four top ADRD risk indexes (CAIDE, LIBRA, Lancet, and ADU-ADRI), and a comprehensive midlife ADRD risk index, the DunedinARB. Poorer retinal microvascular health (narrower arterioles and wider venules) was associated with greater ADRD risk (Î²s = 0.16-0.31; <i>p</i>s < 0.001). Thinner RNFL was modestly associated with higher ADRD risk (Î²s = 0.05-0.08; <i>p</i>s = 0.02-0.13). Follow-up tests of distinct domains of ADRD risk indicated that while RNFL associations reflected cardiometabolic risk only, microvascular measures were associated with diverse ADRD risk factors. Measures of retinal health, particularly microvascular measures, successfully capture ADRD risk across several domains of known risk factors, even at the young midlife age of 45 years. Retinal microvascular imaging may be an accessible, scalable, and relatively low-cost method of assessing ADRD risk among middle-aged adults."

    "abstract": "Chronic liver damage, such as metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), viral hepatitis B or C, cholestatic hepatitis (PBC, PSC), toxic damage (alcohol) or genetic alterations (hemochromatosis, Wilson's disease, etc.) usually cause a chronic inflammatory response in liver cells or bile duct epithelial cells. In the long term this chronic inflammatory response can lead to scarring of the liver, a condition known as fibrosis. The development of liver fibrosis is largely independent of the causative agent, although the pattern of initial fibrosis (periportal, pericentral or sinusoidal) can vary. Untreated and progressive fibrosis can sometimes lead to complete architectural deconstruction and deposition of connective tissue in the liver, intestines and other parenchymal organs, with a gradual loss of function. In the end stage of liver cirrhosis, portal hypertension, encephalopathy, bleeding or carcinomas, e.g., hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocellular carcinoma (iCCCa), can occur. Intestinal fibrosis is one of the most devastating complications of Crohn's disease. With novel and consistent therapeutic interventions, fibrotic processes can be stopped and reversed. New research technologies have substantially improved our knowledge of liver fibrogenesis and intestinal fibrosis. The focus of this review article is on MASLD and Crohn's disease, chronic inflammatory diseases of the liver and intestines with increasing prevalence and a major impact on the general population. The current principles and potential possibilities of preventive and therapeutic antifibrotic interventions are illustrated."

    "abstract": "Wilson's Disease (WD) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene. These mutations lead to defective copper (Cu) transport and to accumulation of Cu in tissues, primarily in the liver and brain. Current treatment options such as D-penicillamine, trientine, and zinc salts focus on increasing Cu excretion or reducing Cu absorption, but often cause debilitating side effects. N,N'-bis(2-mercaptoethyl)isophthalamide (NBMI) is a lipophilic thiol-based compound originally developed for environmental decontamination. It has been shown to chelate toxic metals such as mercury, lead, and cadmium. This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of NBMI to mitigate Cu overload using both in vitro and in vivo models of WD. HepG2 cells with the ATP7B gene knocked down had increased sensitivity to copper sulfate (CuSO<sub>4</sub>) compared to wild-type (WT) cells, validating the cell model for WD. Pretreatment with NBMI (2.5-50 Î¼M) improved cell viability, reduced Cu-induced oxidative stress, decreased metallothionein levels, mitigated resulting DNA damage, and reduced overall levels of free intracellular Cu. In an established toxic milk mouse (tx-J) model of WD, 1% dietary NBMI effectively lowered hepatic, cerebral, and renal Cu levels. Treatment with 1% NBMI also improved liver function, as evidenced by reduced ALT levels and normalized hepatocyte morphology. Tx-J mice displayed higher liver-to-body weight ratios compared to WT mice, and treatment with 1% NBMI effectively reduced this ratio. While NBMI did not impact the elevated white blood cell counts and low platelet levels characteristic of tx-J mice, it also did not cause any detrimental effects on red blood cell, hemoglobin, and hematocrit levels. This dose of NBMI also restored homeostasis of other dysregulated essential metal ions in tx-J mice. These findings suggest that dietary administration of NBMI effectively chelates excess free Cu, ameliorates WD symptoms and offers a promising alternative to existing chelators."

    "abstract": "Over the past two decades, intravascular optical coherence tomography (IVOCT) has emerged as a promising tool for planning percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI), studying coronary artery disease, and assessing treatments. With its near-histological resolution and optical contrast, IVOCT uniquely evaluates coronary plaque characteristics, enhancing the guidance of interventional procedures. Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have been widely applied to IVOCT imaging, providing fast and accurate automated interpretation. These techniques hold significant potential for both clinical and research purposes. Clinically, automated analysis offers comprehensive assessments of coronary plaques, leading to better treatment decisions during PCI. For research, automated interpretation of IVOCT opens new avenues to understand the pathophysiology of coronary atherosclerosis. However, these techniques face several limitations, including issues related to spatial resolution, challenges in manual assessments, and the additional time required for these analyses. This review covers recent advancements and applications of AI techniques and computational simulation methods in IVOCT image analysis, including vessel wall segmentation, plaque characterization, stent analysis, and their clinical applications. Furthermore, we discuss the potential of AI-enhanced IVOCT analysis to facilitate personalized decision-making, potentially improving short- and long-term patient outcomes."

    "abstract": "Anthropogenic land use impacts infectious diseases at the wildlife-domestic-human interface by changing host spatial distribution, behavior, density, and population dynamics. Canine distemper virus (CDV) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in many wild and domestic animals. Given the propensity of CDV to infect synanthropic mesocarnivores, it is important to investigate host and environmental factors affecting mesocarnivore CDV infection. Here, we investigated patterns of CDV infection and developed a statistical model to identify environmental variables related to CDV risk in commonly affected mesocarnivores. We sampled carcasses (<i>N</i> = 270) submitted to the Southeastern Cooperative Wildlife Disease Study from January 2019 to December 2022 and sequenced the CDV H-gene of 32 CDV-positive animals. Overall, 158 out of 270 mesocarnivores (58.5%) and four species (raccoon, red fox, gray fox, and striped skunk) were diagnosed with CDV across 13 states. Ripley's K analysis showed positive cases were more spatially clustered at larger distances than expected due to chance. A generalized linear model for CDV-infected animals showed surface imperviousness, precipitation, and subadult/adult age classes were significant positive explanatory variables, but elevation had a significant negative association with CDV infection likelihood. H-gene sequence diversity among wild mesocarnivores in the southeastern United States was geographically separated into groups east and west of the Mississippi River, with only two eastern samples clustering with western groups. By identifying areas of intense human development at the highest risk for CDV, it may be possible to focus surveillance efforts in these areas, allowing for earlier outbreak identification, potentially preventing cross-species CDV transmission. Anthropogenic land use change can impact infectious disease spread by altering animal distribution and behavior. Canine distemper virus (CDV) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in wild and domestic carnivores. This study investigated how land use influences CDV infection in wild carnivores by examining tissues collected between 2019 and 2022 from wild carnivores found dead in the southeastern United States. CDV strains were geographically distinct, with differences between populations east and west of the Mississippi river. Statistical models showed areas with increased human development and higher precipitation had higher CDV risk; however, there was lower risk associated with higher elevations and younger animals. The importance of this study is that it identifies geographic structure of CDV in the southern United States, and identifies land-use associations with potential high-risk areas for CDV transmission-information that is useful for wildlife disease surveillance and control strategies."

    "abstract": "Studies on procalcitonin (PCT) for identifying sepsis were published as early as 1993 and since then, PCT has been the topic of over 8,500 studies. Several studies show PCT to be superior to CRP in differentiating invasive infections such as sepsis from viral infections, especially early in the disease course. However, its actual use in clinical practice is poorly documented. Our aim was to study the use of PCT in febrile children attending the ED across Europe and compare this to the use of CRP. The MOFICHE/PERFORM study, a prospective multicenter study, took place at 12 European EDs in eight countries and included febrile children < 18 years. In this secondary analysis of nine participating EDs that used PCT, descriptive analyses were performed, describing the use of PCT in all febrile children and for different age groups, foci of fever and fever duration. In total, 31,612 pediatric febrile episodes were available for analyses. Blood tests were performed in 15,812 (50.0%, range 9.6-92.6%)) febrile episodes. CRP was included in 98.3% of blood tests (range between hospitals 80-100%), while PCT was included in only 3.9% (range 0.1-86%). PCT was most often performed in children below 3 months (12.0% versus 3.6% in older children, p < 0.001). PCT was used slightly more often in children with fever less than 24 h in comparison to children with a duration of fever â¥ 24 h (4.9% versus 3.4%, p < 0.001). Regarding clinical alarming signs, PCT was used most often in children with meningeal signs (7.0%) or a non-blanching rash (10.9%). Actual PCT use in febrile children at European EDs is limited and varies largely between hospitals. Possible explanations include lack of guidelines, limited availability, higher costs and lack of readiness to adapt new clinical strategies."

The purpose of this study is to determine if there are any associations or patterns of gross and microscopic neuropathological autopsy findings in the brains of patients who died from COVID-19. We analyzed 32 autopsy cases that met 3 requirements: (1) positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) SARS-CoV-2 test at autopsy; (2) pulmonary histological features of SARS-CoV-2; (3) complete autopsies conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic from 2020 to 2023. We accounted for the presence of the following gross and microscopic neuropathological findings: cerebral edema (CE), cerebral cortical atrophy (CCA), chronic cerebrovascular disease (CCD), cerebral ischemic injury (CII), cerebral inflammation (CIN), and/or cerebral parenchymal hemorrhage (CPH) in every case. We found that CE, CCA, and CII diagnoses had a statistically significant association with age. There were no distinctive or recurrent neuropathological alterations in the autopsied brains that may be interpreted to be pathognomonic of SARS-CoV-2 infection in our cohort. These findings may suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection is not associated with any distinct histomorphologic abnormalities that are diagnostic of COVID-19 in the brains of autopsied patients."

The capacity of vaccination ecosystems to effectively respond and adapt to shocks demonstrates programme resilience. This study sought to describe components that contribute to resilience in national immunisation programmes. Mixed-methods study comprising in-depth interviews and surveys with n=30 vaccination programme experts in eight countries (Brazil, Costa Rica, Greece, Japan, Nigeria, Philippines, Spain and the USA). We elicited data on country-specific shocks, associated effects and factors that facilitated or impeded programme resilience. Interviews and open-ended survey responses were analysed qualitatively, with closed-ended survey questions analysed using descriptive statistics. Experts described immediate effects of shocks including decreased vaccine uptake and negative perceptions of vaccination from the public and media. Late emerging impacts included increased vaccine hesitancy and vaccine-preventable disease (VPD) rates. Stakeholder education, immunisation information systems (IIS) and programme financing were key factors to strengthening programme resilience. Appropriately trained frontline healthcare personnel can counter vaccine misinformation that otherwise erodes trust and contributes to hesitancy. The COVID-19 pandemic also exposed structural weaknesses in programme resilience, with experts highlighting the need for robust IIS and workforce support to mitigate burnout and strengthen resilience when a shock occurs. Our findings provide preliminary insights into factors that experts believe to be associated with vaccination programme resilience. Anticipating, adapting and responding to shocks is central to strengthening systems, ensuring ecosystem resilience and protecting against current and future VPD threats."

Our RNA-seq analysis of steatotic liver from obese mice Â± fenretinide treatment identified major beneficial effects of fenretinide on expression of hepatic genes including Hsd17b13. We sought to determine the relationship between Hsd17b13 expression and MASLD and to validate it as a therapeutic target by liver-specific knockdown. Hsd17b13 expression, which is unique to hepatocytes and associated with the lipid droplet, was elevated in multiple models of MASLD and normalised with the prevention of obesity and steatotic liver. Direct, liver-specific, shRNA-mediated knockdown of Hsd17b13 (shHsd17b13) in high-fat diet (HFD)-obese mice, markedly improved hepatic steatosis with no effect on body weight, adiposity or glycaemia. shHsd17b13 decreased elevated serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), serum fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) levels, and markers of liver fibrosis, for example, expression of Timp2. shHsd17b13 knockdown in HFD-obese mice and Hsd17b13 overexpression in cells reciprocally regulated expression of lipid metabolism genes, for example, Cd36. Global lipidomic analysis of liver tissue revealed a major decrease in diacylglycerols (e.g. DAG 34:3) with shHsd17b13 expression and an increase in phosphatidylcholines containing polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) for example, phosphatidylcholine (PC) 34:3 and PC 42:10. Expression of key genes involved in phospholipid and PUFA metabolism, for example, Cept1, was also reciprocally regulated suggesting a potential mechanism of Hsd17b13 biological function and role in MASLD. In conclusion, Hsd17b13 knockdown in HFD-obese adult mice was able to alleviate MASLD via regulation of fatty acid and phospholipid metabolism, thereby confirming HSD17B13 as a genuine therapeutic target for MASLD and the development of liver fibrosis."

Across four independent cohorts, we find circulating miR-126-3p is elevated in knee osteoarthritis versus controls. Across six primary human knee osteoarthritis tissues, miR-126-3p is highest in subchondral bone, fat pad and synovium, and lowest in cartilage. Following both intravenous and intra-articular miR-126-3p mimic treatment in a surgical mouse model of knee osteoarthritis, we show reduced disease severity in males. In human knee osteoarthritis biospecimens, miR-126-3p mimic treatment reduces genes and markers associated with angiogenesis, as well as genes linked to osteogenesis, adipogenesis, and synovitis-processes secondary to angiogenesis. Our findings indicate that miR-126-3p is elevated in knee osteoarthritis and mitigates disease severity, supporting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target."

There is also a scarcity of large and diverse population-based cohort studies examining SI/L that have confirmed clinical diagnoses of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Notably, beyond individual associations, whether the effects of SI/L compound and accelerate CD and incident AD are not known. We hypothesized that SI and L, independently, would be associated with CD and incident AD to a similar extent, and the association of SI with CD and incident AD would be higher in lonely older adults. Prospective cohort study. Urban Chicago areas. We analyzed data in the Chicago Health and Aging Project (CHAP), which comprised 7,760 biracial community-dwelling older adults [mean age (standard deviation (SD))=72.3 (6.3); 64 % Black & 63 % women; mean (SD) of follow-up=7.9 (4.3) years]. NA MEASUREMENTS: Linear mixed and logistic regression models were used to regress CD and incident AD separately on the SI index/L. SI index and L were significantly associated with CD, with one-point increase of beta estimate (SE, p-value) = -0.002 (0.001,0.022) and -0.012 (0.003,<0.001), respectively. Given that the SI index ranges from 0 to 5 and the L from 0 to 1, they had similar effect sizes. Similarly, there were significant associations between SI index and incident AD, odds ratio (95 % CI, p-value) = 1.183 (1.016-1.379,0.029), and between L and incident AD, 2.117 (1.227-3.655,0.006). When stratified by loneliness status, compared to older adults who were not isolated and not lonely, older adults who reported being socially isolated and not lonely experienced accelerated CD, -0.003 (0.001,0.004), despite no significantly increased odds of incident AD. SI/L had significant associations with CD and incident AD. Notably, socially isolated older adults who reported not being lonely appeared to be most socially vulnerable to CD. These findings suggest a specific at-risk subgroup of socially vulnerable older adults for future targeted interventions to improve cognitive health."

    "abstract": "Human growth hormone (hGH) has been in clinical use for children with GH deficiency (GHD) since the late 1950s. The original formulations were considered very safe with few adverse events reported. That changed remarkably in 1985 when the first patients with GHD, who had been treated with cadaveric hGH, were diagnosed with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). Fortunately, that same year a robust supply of recombinant hGH was released to the market whose adverse event profile did not include CJD. Patients who had received National Hormone and Pituitary Program hGH have been continuously followed since 1985. It is clear that prions are causative for CJD. Within the last 10 years there have been reports that similar preparations of cadaveric hGH may have been contaminated with amyloid Î² (AÎ²) protein, a material that is related to Alzheimer disease. Eight patients in the United Kingdom, who had received cadaveric hGH extracted in an analogous manner to that in the United States, had conditions compatible with Alzheimer disease, although they did not fulfill all of the requirements for that diagnosis. In this report we discuss the findings of both CJD and Alzheimer disease, especially as they relate to a possible transmission of the diseases by prions and AÎ² protein."

    "abstract": "Breast cancer survivors are at increased risk of cardiovascular events due to the cardiotoxic effects of cancer treatment. Exercise participation can lower the risk of various adverse cardiovascular health outcomes. However, most breast cancer survivors do not meet exercise guidelines. To map and critically evaluate the observational literature describing the direction and strength of the relationship between post-diagnosis leisure-time exercise (aerobic and muscle-strengthening) and cardiovascular health (cardiovascular disease, cardiac function, and related physiological risk factors) among diverse breast cancer survivors; and identify variations in this relationship based on race, ethnicity, and/or socioeconomic status. Our scoping review was conducted in accordance with established guidelines and frameworks. Seven databases were searched. Participant characteristics, findings regarding the relationship between exercise and cardiovascular health, and any variations in this relationship were extracted. Article quality was appraised using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. Fourteen sources were identified, and study quality varied. Two adjusted analyses found aerobic exercise may lower the risk of cardiovascular disease. There was limited data found on the direction and strength of an adjusted relationship between exercise (aerobic or muscle-strengthening) and other cardiovascular outcomes or possible variations in the relationship across racial, ethnic, or socioeconomic groups. Findings highlight a considerable gap in knowledge regarding the relationship between exercise and cardiovascular health among diverse breast cancer survivors. Further longitudinal observational research is needed to better establish the direction and strength of this relationship, and how it differs based on race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status."

    "abstract": "Wolfram syndrome (<i>WFS1-</i>Spectrum Disorder) is an ultra-rare monogenic form of progressive neurodegeneration and diabetes mellitus. In common with most rare diseases, there are no therapies to slow or stop disease progression. Sodium valproate, an anticonvulsant with neuroprotective properties, is anticipated to mediate its effect via alteration of cell cycle kinetics, increases in p21<sup>cip1</sup> expression levels and reduction in apoptosis and increase in Wolframin protein expression. To date, there have been no multicentre randomised controlled trials investigating the efficacy of treatments for neurodegeneration in patients with Wolfram syndrome. TREATWOLFRAM is an international, multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised clinical trial designed to investigate whether 36-month treatment with up to 40 mg/kg/day of sodium valproate will slow the rate of loss of visual acuity as a biomarker for neurodegeneration in patients with Wolfram syndrome. Patients who satisfied the eligibility criteria were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive two times per day oral gastro-resistant sodium valproate tablets up to a maximum dose of 800 mg 12 hourly or sodium valproate-matched placebo. Using hierarchical repeated measures analyses with a 5% significance level, 80% power and accounting for an estimated 15% missing data rate, a sample size of 70 was set. The primary outcome measure, visual acuity, will be centrally reviewed and analysed on an intention-to-treat population. The protocol was approved by the National Research Ethics Service (West of Scotland; 18/WS/0020) and by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency. Recruitment into TREATWOLFRAM started in January 2019 and ended in November 2021. The treatment follow-up of TREATWOLFRAM participants is ongoing and due to finish in November 2024. Updates on trial progress are disseminated via Wolfram Syndrome UK quarterly newsletters and at family conferences for patient support groups. The findings of this trial will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and international presentations. NCT03717909."

This process evaluation aimed to evaluate the implementation of inclisiran for patients with elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) or ASCVD-risk equivalents (n=900), from the perspectives of key stakeholders. VICTORION-Spirit was a phase IIIb, multicentre, randomised, controlled study. We followed a process evaluation strategy to collate the views of stakeholders via semistructured interviews and to gain insights on the 'implementability' of inclisiran in primary care. Data were generated via interviews with patients, healthcare providers and research nurses and analysed using a qualitative rapid analysis approach. Primary care in Greater Manchester, UK. 84 participants were interviewed, including patients (n=56), professionals at participating practices in VICTORION-Spirit (n=13), health advisors (n=4) and research nurses (n=11). Interim findings suggest the process of receiving and providing inclisiran during the study was 'straightforward', and the behavioural support provided to some patients was generally viewed favourably. Beyond the trial, patients and healthcare providers thought the delivery of inclisiran could work well as a practice nurse-provided service. Barriers to implementing inclisiran were generally related to workforce and workload pressures in primary care, and an incentive structure to support delivery was recommended. Patients and healthcare providers supported implementing inclisiran in primary care. It was convenient for patients to receive inclisiran in general practice, and most providers felt that the intervention was a useful addition to existing lipid-lowering treatments. Several barriers to implementation were highlighted, including concerns relating to general practice resources and costs. NCT04807400."

Using data from the randomized ISCHEMIA trial (International Study of Comparative Health Effectiveness with Medical and Invasive Approaches; July 2012 to January 2018, 37 countries), the health status benefits of an invasive strategy over a conservative one were examined within appropriate use criteria scenarios. Among 1833 participants mapped to 36 appropriate use criteria scenarios, symptom status was assessed using the Seattle Angina Questionnaire-7 at 1 year for each scenario and for each of the 6 patient characteristics used to define the scenarios. Coronary anatomy and SYNTAX(Synergy between percutaneous coronary intervention with Taxus and cardiac surgery) scores were measured using coronary computed tomography angiography. Treatment effects are expressed as an odds ratio for a better health status outcome with an invasive versus conservative treatment strategy using Bayesian hierarchical proportional odds models. Differences in the primary clinical outcome were similarly examined. The mean age was 63 years, 81% were male, and 71% were White. Diabetes was present in 28% and multivessel disease in 51%. Most clinical scenarios favored invasive for better 1-year health status. The benefit of an invasive strategy on Seattle Angina Questionnaire angina frequency scores was reduced for asymptomatic patients (odds ratio [95% credible interval], 1.16 [0.66-1.71] versus 2.26 [1.75-2.80]), as well as for those on no antianginal medications. Diabetes, number of diseased vessels, proximal left anterior descending coronary artery location, and SYNTAX score did not effectively identify patients with better health status after invasive treatment, and minimal differences in clinical events were observed. Applying the randomization scheme from the ISCHEMIA trial to appropriate clinical scenarios revealed baseline symptoms and antianginal therapy to be the primary drivers of health status benefits from invasive management. Consideration should be given to reducing the patient characteristics collected to generate appropriateness ratings to improve the feasibility of future data collection.

    "abstract": "Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a mosquito-borne zoonotic disease within the genus <i>Phlebovirus</i>. Symptoms of the disease in animals range from moderate to severe febrile illness, which significantly impacts the livestock industry and causes severe health complications in humans. Similar to bunyaviruses in the genus <i>Orthobunyavirus</i> transmitted by mosquitoes, RVFV progression is dependent on the susceptibility of the physical, cellular, microbial, and immune response barriers of the vectors. These barriers, shaped by the genetic makeup of the mosquito species and the surrounding environmental temperature, exert strong selective pressure on the virus, affecting its replication, evolution, and spread. The changing climate coupled with the aforementioned bottlenecks are significant drivers of RVF epidemics and expansion into previously nonendemic areas. Despite the link between microclimatic changes and RVF outbreaks, there is still a dearth of knowledge on how these temperature effects impact RVF transmission and vector competence and virus persistence during interepidemic years. This intricate interdependence between the virus, larval habitat temperatures, and vector competence necessitates increased efforts in addressing RVFV disease burden. This review highlights recent advancements made in response to shifting demographics, weather patterns, and conveyance of RVFV. Additionally, ongoing studies related to temperature-sensitive variations in RVFV-vector interactions and knowledge gaps are discussed."

    "abstract": "<b>Introduction</b>: Obesity is a chronic disease associated with increased risk for several cancers, including colorectal cancer (CRC), a leading cause of cancer-related mortality. The majority of CRC cases are associated with modifiable risk factors. Metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS) is a proven, durable, and successful intervention for obesity. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of MBS on CRC risk through measures of association, such as relative risk (RR) and odds ratio (OR). <b>Methods</b>: A systematic search of PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, and Embase was conducted to identify systematic reviews (SR) and meta-analyses examining the relationship between obesity treated with MBS and CRC incidence. The PICO framework guided inclusion criteria, and three independent reviewers screened articles using Rayyan software. Quality assessment was performed using AMSTAR2. <b>Results</b>: Of 1336 screened articles, 10 SR met inclusion criteria, encompassing 53,452,658 patients. Meta-analyses consistently showed a significant reduction in CRC risk following MBS in patients with severe obesity. Risk reductions were reported by Liu et al. (RR: 0.46, 95% CI: 0.32-0.67, <i>p</i> < 0.01), Chierici et al. (RR: 0.46, 95% CI: 0.28-0.75, <i>p</i> = 0.018), Wilson et al. (RR: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.53-0.88, <i>p</i> = 0.003), and Pararas et al. (RR: 0.56, 95% CI: 0.40-0.80, <i>p</i> < 0.001). Sensitivity analyses supported these findings. For colon cancer, Liu and Chierici both reported an RR of 0.75 (95% CI: 0.46-1.21, <i>p</i> = 0.2444) with significant heterogeneity (I<sup>2</sup> = 89%). A trend towards reduced rectal cancer risk (RR: 0.74, 95% CI: 0.40-1.39, <i>p</i> = 0.3523) was noted but limited by fewer studies. Sex-specific analyses revealed protective effects in both sexes, with a more pronounced impact in females (RR: 0.54, 95% CI: 0.37-0.79, <i>p</i> = 0.0014). <b>Conclusions</b>: This umbrella review synthesizes current evidence on the impact of MBS on CRC risk, highlighting a consistent protective association. The findings also indicate a potential risk reduction for both colon and rectal cancer, with a more pronounced effect observed among females compared to males. Given the profound implications of MBS on cancer incidence, morbidity, and mortality, further high-quality, long-term studies are essential to deepen our understanding and optimize its role in cancer prevention and patient care."

    "abstract": "Wilson's disease (WD) is an inherited disorder characterized by abnormal copper metabolism with complex pathological features. Currently, the mechanism of copper overload-induced hepatic injury is unclear. Green tea is a natural chelator, and its main ingredients, green tea polyphenol (GTP) and L-theanine (L-TA) are good at binding to heavy metals like iron and copper. There have been no reports on green tea extracts (GTE) for the treatment of Wilson's disease. This study investigated the hepatoprotective effect of GTE on WD model mice. Initially, we examined the impact of green tea extract on copper metabolism, excretion, and hepatoprotective effects in WD model toxic milk mice. Then, Ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC-DAD) was established to analyze GTP and L-TA in green tea extract. Further screening of eight active components and copper complex active components in green tea extract was carried out by ion analyzer. Finally, we verified the pharmacodynamic effects of these active ingredients at the animal level. The results showed that GTE improves liver function and attenuates liver injury in TX mice by promoting tissue copper excretion and inhibiting oxidative stress, which provides a theoretical basis for green tea's potential to improve the clinical symptoms of WD."

The National Inpatient Sample (NIS) was queried from 2016 to 2020 for adult hospitalizations with MASLD. Exclusion criteria included concurrent diagnoses of viral hepatitis, alcoholic hepatitis, primary biliary cholangitis, hereditary hemochromatosis, autoimmune hepatitis, or Wilson disease. Outcomes of MASLD and its complications were compared between the lean and nonlean subgroups. Patients with lean BMI had higher mortality rates (odds ratio: 2.10, P<0.001). The lean cohort also had higher odds of cirrhosis, portal hypertension, SBP, and ascites. The lean subgroup had higher odds of gastrointestinal malignancies including esophageal cancer, gastric cancer, pancreatic cancer, and colorectal cancer. Hospitalized lean MASLD patients had higher odds of mortality, ââhepatic morbidities, and gastrointestinal malignancies. These results challenge the use of BMI as a predictor of morbidity and mortality for MASLD patients. Future studies should focus on therapeutic options for MASLD and compare their efficacies between lean and nonlean populations."

In the Glycemia Reduction Approaches in Diabetes: A Comparative Effectiveness Study (GRADE), Î²-cell function parameters derived from mathematical modeling of oral glucose tolerance tests were assessed at baseline (N = 4,712) and 1, 3, and 5 years following randomization to insulin glargine, glimepiride, liraglutide, or sitagliptin, added to baseline metformin. Parameters included insulin secretion rate (ISR), glucose sensitivity (insulin response to glucose), rate sensitivity (early insulin response), and potentiation. Linear mixed-effects models were used to compare changes across treatments. With Cox proportional hazards and Classification And Regression Tree (CART) analyses we evaluated associations between model parameters and glycemic failure (A1C >7.5%; 58.5 mmol/mol). Î²-Cell function parameters increased variably at year 1 across treatments but subsequently declined for all treatments. Statistically significant changes were noted. Liraglutide led to the greatest increases in ISR, glucose sensitivity and potentiation, remaining above baseline at study end. Sitagliptin improved glucose sensitivity, with modest effects on other parameters. Glimepiride temporarily increased ISR and rate sensitivity but minimally increased glucose sensitivity or potentiation. Rate sensitivity increased most with glargine. Higher Î²-cell function parameters were protective against glycemic deterioration, but treatment did not alter the relationship between these parameters and glycemic outcomes. Common glucose-lowering medications impact different physiologic components of Î²-cell function in T2D. Regardless of treatment modality, lower Î²-cell function associated with early glycemic failure, and Î²-cell function progressively declined after initial improvement."

    "abstract": "Copper accumulation in neurons induces oxidative stress, disrupts mitochondrial activity, and accelerates neuronal death, which is central to the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases like Wilson disease. Standard treatments for copper toxicity, such as D-penicillamine, trientine, and chloroquine, are frequently associated with severe side effects, creating a need for safer therapeutic alternatives. To address this, we developed a curcumin-loaded nanoemulsion (CUR-NE) using the spontaneous emulsification technique, aimed at enhancing the bioavailability and therapeutic efficacy of curcumin. The optimized nanoemulsion displayed a particle size of 76.42 nm, a zeta potential of -20.4 mV, and a high encapsulation efficiency of 93.69%, with a stable and uniform structure. The in vitro tests on SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells demonstrated that CUR-NE effectively protected against copper-induced toxicity, promoting significant cellular uptake. Pharmacokinetic studies revealed that CUR-NE exhibited a longer half-life and extended circulation time compared to free curcumin. Additionally, pharmacodynamic evaluations, including biochemical assays and histopathological analysis, confirmed that CUR-NE provided superior neuroprotection in copper overload conditions. These results emphasize the ability of CUR-NE to augment the therapeutic effects of curcumin, presenting a novel approach for managing copper-induced neurodegeneration. The study highlights the effectiveness of nanoemulsion-based delivery platforms in improving chelation treatments for neurological diseases."

The widespread use of herbs and medicinal plants in traditional medicine has garnered increasing recognition as a valuable resource for increasing wellness and reducing the onset of disease. Several epidemiologic and clinical studies have shown that altering blood lipid profiles and maintaining gut homeostasis may protect against cardiovascular diseases. <b>Methods</b>: A randomised, active-controlled parallel human clinical trial (n = 52) with three herbal tea infusions (green (<i>Camellia sinensis</i>) tea with rhubarb root, green tea with senna, and active control green tea) daily for 21 days in a free-living healthy adult cohort was conducted to assess the potential for health benefits in terms of plasma lipids and gut health. Paired plasma samples were analysed using Afinion lipid panels (total cholesterol, LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol, HDL (high-density lipoprotein) cholesterol, triglycerides, and non-HDL cholesterol) and paired stool samples were analysed using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing to determine bacterial diversity within the gut microbiome. <b>Results</b>: Among participants providing fasting blood samples before and after the intervention (n = 47), consumption of herbal rhubarb root tea and green tea significantly lowered total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and non-HDL cholesterol (<i>p</i> < 0.05) in plasma after 21 days of daily consumption when compared with concentrations before the intervention. No significant change was observed in the senna tea group. In participants providing stool samples (n = 48), no significant differences in overall microbial composition were observed between pre- and post-intervention, even at the genus level. While no significant changes in overall microbial composition were observed, specific bacterial genera, such as Dorea spp., showed correlations with LDL cholesterol concentrations, suggesting potential microbiota-mediated effects of tea consumption. Diet and BMI was maintained in each of the three groups before and after the trial. <b>Conclusions</b>: It was found that drinking a cup of rhubarb root herbal or green tea infusion for 21 days produced beneficial effects on lipid profiles and maintained gut eubiosis without observable adverse effects in a healthy human cohort. More studies are needed to fully understand the effects of rhubarb root and green tea in fatty acid metabolism and gut microbial composition."

    "abstract": "Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a global health crisis, responsible for nearly 20 million deaths annually worldwide and 12.6% of all deaths in the United States. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are critical for developing evidence-based clinical guidelines, but inconsistent outcome reporting across RCTs hinders evidence synthesis and comparability. In 2015, McNamara et al. introduced a CAD core outcome set (COS) to promote standardization in CAD trial outcomes. This study evaluates the uptake of the CAD COS in RCTs registered at ClinicalTrials.gov since its publication. This trial registry analysis evaluated the uptake of the CAD COS in phase III/IV RCTs registered on ClinicalTrials.gov from May 2010 to June 2023. Trials were included if they assessed CAD interventions and excluded if the trials were non-randomized, focused on diagnostic tests, or were categorized as \"not applicable\" (e.g., behavioral interventions). COS adherence was measured as the proportion of reported outcomes among the 23 defined in the CAD COS. We analyzed changes in adherence over time, including pre- and post-COS publication periods, with secondary analyses examining continent, sponsor type, recruitment status, and enrollment number. Among 433 trials, procedural interventions (45.0%) and all-cause mortality (40.9%) were the most reported outcomes, while acute renal failure (2.1%) and dyspnea (2.8%) were the least. Pre-2015, trials reported an average of 11.5% of the COS-defined outcomes. Post-2015, trials initiated after the CAD COS publication reported a slightly higher proportion of COS-defined outcomes compared to earlier trials, reflecting a modest increase in the number of items reported. However, this increase was not statistically significant (p = 0.012). Recruitment status significantly influenced adherence (p < 0.001), while continent and sponsor type did not. A weak positive correlation was observed between enrollment number and adherence (r = 0.27, p < 0.001). Despite its publication in 2015, CAD COS uptake remains limited, with no significant changes in adherence over time. Barriers such as limited dissemination, lack of trialist awareness, and preferences for custom outcomes likely contribute to these findings. Greater emphasis on education, patient-centered outcomes, and COS tailored to specific CAD indications is needed to enhance uptake and comparability in CAD trials."

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT-2i) have demonstrated benefit in reducing T2DM-related morbidity and mortality, but their effects in individuals with concomitant T2DM and atrial fibrillation remain unclear. This meta-analysis is the first to evaluate impact of SGLT-2i in this patient population. PubMed/MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and reference lists of the included articles were systematically searched. Results were pooled using a random-effects model and outcomes were reported as risk ratios (RR) with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs). Meta-regression analyses based on baseline patient characteristics were conducted to assess potential sources of heterogeneity. Seven retrospective cohort studies and one randomized controlled trial corresponding to 37,229 patients were included, of whom 13,030 received SGLT-2i and 24,199 received other oral anti-diabetic drugs. Follow-up ranged from 2 to 5 years. SGLT-2i use was associated with decreased risk of all-cause mortality (RR = 0.37; 95 % CI: 0.28-0.50), heart failure (RR = 0.66; 95 % CI: 0.53-0.83), stroke (RR = 0.76; 95 % CI: 0.66-0.88), and cardiovascular mortality (RR = 0.57; 95 % CI: 0.44-0.74).

SGLT-2i reduced all-cause mortality, heart failure, stroke, and cardiovascular mortality in individuals with T2DM and atrial fibrillation. Large-scale, randomized controlled trials are warranted to confirm these findings."

    "title": "Combined immunoinformatic approaches with computational biochemistry for development of subunit-based vaccine against Lawsonia intracellularis.",
    "abstract": "Lawsonia intracellularis (LI) are obligate intracellular bacteria and the causative agent of proliferative hemorrhagic enteropathy that significantly impacts the health of piglets and the profitability of the swine industry. In this study, we used immunoinformatic and computational methodologies such as homology modelling, molecular docking, molecular dynamic (MD) simulation, and free energy calculations in a novel three stage approach to identify strong T and B cell epitopes in the LI proteome. From â¼ 1342 LI proteins, we narrowed our focus to 256 proteins that were either not well-identified (unknown role) or were expressed at a higher frequency in pathogenic strains relative to non-pathogenic strains. At stage 1, these proteins were analyzed for predicted virulence, antigenicity, solubility, and probability of residing within a membrane. At stage 2, we used NetMHCPan4-1 to identify over ten thousand cytotoxic T lymphocyte epitopes (CTLEs) and 286 CTLEs were ranked as having high predicted binding affinity for the SLA-1 and SLA-2 complexes. At stage 3, we used homology modeling to predict the structures of the top ranked CTLEs and we subjected each of them to molecular docking analysis with SLA-1*0401 and SLA-2*0402. The top ranked 25 SLA-CTLE complexes were selected to be an input for subsequent MD simulations to fully investigate the atomic-level dynamics of proteins under the natural thermal fluctuation of water and thus potentially provide deep insight into the CTLE-SLA interaction. We also performed free energy evaluation by Molecular Mechanics/Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area to predict epitope interactions and binding affinities to the SLA-1 and SLA-2. We identified the top five CTLEs having the strongest binding energy to the indicated SLAs (-305.6 kJ/mol, -219.5 kJ/mol, -214.8 kJ/mol, -139.5 kJ/mol and -92.6 kJ/mol, respectively.) W also performed B-cell epitope prediction and the top-ranked 5 CTLEs and 3 B-cell epitopes were organized into a multi-epitope subunit antigen vaccine construct joined using EAAAK, AAY, KK, and GGGGG linkers with 40 residues of the LI DnaK protein attached to the N-terminus to further enhance the antigenicity of the vaccine construct. Blind docking studies showed strong interactions between our vaccine construct with swine Toll-like receptor 5. Collectively, these molecular modeling and immunoinformatic analyses present a useful in silico protocol for the discovery of candidate antigen in many viral and bacterial pathogens."

    "title": "<i>KMT2B</i>-related disorders: expansion of the phenotypic spectrum and long-term efficacy of deep brain stimulation.",
    "abstract": "Heterozygous mutations in <i>KMT2B</i> are associated with an early-onset, progressive and often complex dystonia (DYT28). Key characteristics of typical disease include focal motor features at disease presentation, evolving through a caudocranial pattern into generalized dystonia, with prominent oromandibular, laryngeal and cervical involvement. Although <i>KMT2B</i>-related disease is emerging as one of the most common causes of early-onset genetic dystonia, much remains to be understood about the full spectrum of the disease. We describe a cohort of 53 patients with <i>KMT2B</i> mutations, with detailed delineation of their clinical phenotype and molecular genetic features. We report new disease presentations, including atypical patterns of dystonia evolution and a subgroup of patients with a non-dystonic neurodevelopmental phenotype. In addition to the previously reported systemic features, our study has identified co-morbidities, including the risk of status dystonicus, intrauterine growth retardation, and endocrinopathies. Analysis of this study cohort (<i>n</i> = 53) in tandem with published cases (<i>n</i> = 80) revealed that patients with chromosomal deletions and protein truncating variants had a significantly higher burden of systemic disease (with earlier onset of dystonia) than those with missense variants. Eighteen individuals had detailed longitudinal data available after insertion of deep brain stimulation for medically refractory dystonia. Median age at deep brain stimulation was 11.5 years (range: 4.5-37.0 years). Follow-up after deep brain stimulation ranged from 0.25 to 22 years. Significant improvement of motor function and disability (as assessed by the Burke Fahn Marsden's Dystonia Rating Scales, BFMDRS-M and BFMDRS-D) was evident at Å months, 1 year and last follow-up (motor, <i>P</i> = 0.001, <i>P</i> = 0.004, and <i>P</i> = 0.012; disability, <i>P</i> = 0.009, <i>P</i> = 0.002 and <i>P</i> = 0.012). At 1 year post-deep brain stimulation, >50% of subjects showed BFMDRS-M and BFMDRS-D improvements of >30%. In the long-term deep brain stimulation cohort (deep brain stimulation inserted for >5 years, <i>n</i> = 8), improvement of >30% was maintained in 5/8 and 3/8 subjects for the BFMDRS-M and BFMDRS-D, respectively. The greatest BFMDRS-M improvements were observed for trunk (53.2%) and cervical (50.5%) dystonia, with less clinical impact on laryngeal dystonia. Improvements in gait dystonia decreased from 20.9% at 1 year to 1Å.2% at last assessment; no patient maintained a fully independent gait. Reduction of BFMDRS-D was maintained for swallowing (52.9%). Five patients developed mild parkinsonism following deep brain stimulation. <i>KMT2B-</i>related disease comprises an expanding continuum from infancy to adulthood, with early evidence of genotype-phenotype correlations. Except for laryngeal dysphonia, deep brain stimulation provides a significant improvement in quality of life and function with sustained clinical benefit depending on symptoms distribution."

    "abstract": "Many difficult to understand clinical features characterize COVID-19 and Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC or Long COVID, LC). These can include blood pressure instability, hyperinflammation, coagulopathies, and neuropsychiatric complaints. The pathogenesis of these features remains unclear. The SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) binds Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) on the surface of host cells to initiate infection. We hypothesized that some patients may produce anti-RBD antibodies that resemble ACE2 sufficiently to have ACE2-like catalytic activity, that is they are ACE2-like proteolytic abzymes that may help mediate the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and LC. In previous work, we showed that some acute COVID-19 patients had immunoglobulin-associated ACE2-like proteolytic activity, suggesting that some COVID-19 patients indeed produced ACE2-like abzymes. However, it remained unknown whether ACE2-like abzymes were seen only in acute COVID-19 patients or whether ACE2-like abzymes could also be identified in convalescent COVID-19 patients. Here we show that some convalescent COVID-19 patients attending a clinic for patients with persistent pulmonary symptoms also have ACE2-like abzymes and that the presence of ACE2-like catalytic activity correlates with alterations in blood pressure in an exercise test."

    "abstract": "Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is an immunomodulatory cytokine critical for intestinal immune homeostasis. IL-10 is produced by various immune cells but IL-10 receptor signaling in intestinal CX<sub>3</sub>CR1<sup>+</sup> mononuclear phagocytes is necessary to prevent spontaneous colitis in mice. Here, we utilized fluorescent protein reporters and cell-specific targeting and found that Rorc-expressing innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) produce IL-10 in response to anti-CD40-mediated intestinal inflammation. Deletion of Il10 specifically in Rorc-expressing ILCs led to phenotypic changes in intestinal macrophages and exacerbated both innate and adaptive immune-mediated models of experimental colitis. The population of IL-10<sup>+</sup> producing ILCs shared markers with both ILC2 and ILC3 with nearly all ILC3s being of the NCR<sup>+</sup> subtype. Interestingly, Ccl26 was enriched in IL-10<sup>+</sup> ILCs and was markedly reduced in IL-10-deficient ILC3s. Since CCL26 is a ligand for CX<sub>3</sub>CR1, we employed RNA in situ hybridization and observed increased numbers of ILCs in close proximity to Cx3cr1-expressing cells under inflammatory conditions. Finally, we generated transgenic Rorc<sup>tdTomato</sup> reporter mice that faithfully marked RORÎ³t<sup>+</sup> cells that could rescue disease pathology and aberrant macrophage phenotype following adoptive transfer into mice with selective Il10 deficiency in ILC3s. These results demonstrate that IL-10 production by a population of ILCs functions to promote immune homeostasis in the intestine possibly via direct effects on intestinal macrophages."

    "abstract": "Diuretic resistance (DR) is common among patients admitted with acute heart failure (AHF) and can be estimated by BAN-ADHF scores. Among 317 consecutive patients hospitalized for AHF, BAN-ADHF scores were compared with metrics of DR and composite endpoint of all-cause mortality, HF hospitalization, LVAD, or heart transplantation. The BAN-ADHF score was incorporated into a diuretic dosing calculator and retroactively applied to a patient's diuretic dose to categorize them as adequately dosed or under-dosed (inadequate). The primary outcome studied was attaining >3 L of urine output within the first 24 hours of admission. The median BAN-ADHF score was 9 (IQR of 7-13). A higher BAN-ADHF score was associated with greater DR based on weight loss and urine output (all p <0.001). The highest quartile (Q4) had fewer patients achieve the admission urinary output goal (15% vs 32%, p = 0.004) and lower total urine output (2,009 mL vs 2,559 mL, p = 0.029) compared with the first 3 quartiles. In time-to-event analysis, Q4 of BAN-ADHF score was associated with increased risk of the primary composite endpoint (HR 2.07, 95% CI 1.41 to 3.04). Compared to those below the calculator's recommended dose, patients receiving loop diuretics at goal doses (37.7% of cohort) had greater 24-hour UOP (3,050 vs 2,050 mL), likelihood of UOP goal (45% vs 19%), and weight loss at discharge (8.95 kg vs 5.94 kg; all p <0.001). In conclusion, BAN-ADHF score correlated with diuretic resistance and prognosis, and may capture the risk of DR compared traditional measures like CKD or NT-proBNP."

Patient-derived LGI1-autoantibodies cause isolated symptoms of memory deficits in mice and seizures in rats. Using a multimodal experimental approach, we set out to improve the validity of existing in vivo rodent models to further recapitulate the full clinical syndrome of anti-LGI1 antibody mediated disease. A monoclonal anti-LGI1 antibody (anti-LGI1 mAb) derived from a patient's CSF antibody-secreting cell was infused intracerebroventricularly (ICV) into rats and mice for one or two weeks, respectively. Cellular excitability of CA3 pyramidal neurons was determined in hippocampal slices. Structural changes in mouse brains were explored using MRI. Antibody effects on behavior and brain activity of rats were studied using video-EEG. Anti-LGI1 mAbs augmented the excitability of CA3 pyramidal neurons and elicited convulsive and non-convulsive spontaneous epileptic seizures in mice and rats. Mice displayed a hypoactive and anxious phenotype during behavioral testing. MRI revealed acutely increased hippocampal volume after ICV anti-LGI1 mAb infusion. Video-EEG recordings of juvenile rats uncovered two peaks of seizure frequency during the 7-day antibody infusion period resembling the natural progression of seizures in human anti-LGI1 encephalitis. Our data strongly corroborate and extend our understanding of the direct pathogenic and epileptogenic role of human LGI1 autoantibodies."

To characterize symptom patterns and risk factors associated with symptom severity and duration, COVID-19 and influenza-like illness (ILI) outpatients and their contacts were enrolled at two sites in the United States of America and one site in Thailand. COVID-19 infection was confirmed at enrollment with a positive antigen or PCR test. Baseline demographics and medical histories were collected from participants at enrollment and daily self-reported symptom questionnaires were obtained to assess symptom severity and duration. Risk factors associated with symptom severity and duration were determined by multivariate logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards model. Two hundred and forty one participants meeting the eligibility criteria were enrolled, including 174 confirmed COVID-19 cases (9% Delta and 90% Omicron), 33 ILI cases, and 34 healthy contacts. COVID-19 participants had a shorter median symptom duration of 9.0 (95% CI, 8.0-11.0) days than ILI participants. Infection with the Delta variant resulted in a longer symptom alleviation period compared to infection with the Omicron variant. The most commonly reported symptoms among COVID-19 participants were reported in the nasal and chest/respiratory domains of the FLU-PRO Plus. Participants infected with the Delta variant reported more symptoms overall, with significantly more symptoms affecting eyes and senses reported. 55% of SARS-CoV-2-positive participants reached a negative N1 Ct value by the day 14 study time point. No risk factors for moderate to severe symptoms were identified in this outpatient cohort. Male sex was associated with a shorter symptom duration. Symptom manifestation varied among Delta and Omicron variants. Few risk factors were identified for increased symptom severity or duration."

    "abstract": "The coexistence of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and Wilson's disease (WD) is exceedingly rare, posing significant diagnostic challenges due to overlapping clinical presentations. Neurological and psychiatric manifestations commonly associated with WD can obscure or mimic symptoms of other systemic diseases, complicating accurate diagnosis and management. We report the case of a 17-year-old female diagnosed with WD and concurrent SLE, treated at Civil Hospital, Karachi, Pakistan. The patient initially presented with neuropsychiatric symptoms typical of WD, confirmed by diagnostic findings indicative of hepatic copper accumulation. She later developed significant proteinuria, hematuria, fever, and positive autoimmune serologies, raising suspicion of concurrent SLE. Despite therapeutic interventions, including methylprednisolone (1 mg), the patient's condition deteriorated, and she unfortunately succumbed to complications from a blood transfusion reaction. This case underscores the importance of heightened clinical vigilance when managing overlapping presentations of WD and systemic autoimmune disorders like SLE. Early recognition of WD-specific neurological and psychiatric symptoms is critical for timely diagnosis and intervention, potentially mitigating the risk of severe complications and poor outcomes."

    "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis is an inflammatory demyelinating condition of the central nervous system affecting approximately 1 million people in the USA. Although standard structural MRI techniques are now the main imaging modality for multiple sclerosis diagnosis and management, they are yet to provide information regarding the metabolic profile of the disease. Ultra-high field 7T MRI systems have provided gains in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and spatial resolution for structural MRI as well as larger chemical shifts leading to improvements in specialized imaging sequences, such as nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) imaging, that can evaluate macromolecular metabolite composition. In this work, NOE images were acquired on a cohort of multiple sclerosis and healthy control subjects to spatially map differences in their lipid metabolites as a result of NOE effects. NOE image data were acquired on a total of 25 subjects {15 multiple sclerosis subjects [10 females, 5 males (21-70 years)] and 10 healthy controls [5 females, 5 males (23-71 years)]} on a 7T MRI system with a frequency offset range of -5 to 5 ppm. A five-pool Lorentzian line fitting model was utilized to fit and quantitatively compare direct saturation (DS), magnetization transfer (MT), amide proton transfer (APT), amine, and relayed NOE (rNOE) and used as a comparison to conventional T<sub>1</sub> maps. Grey and white matter tissues were segmented using the T<sub>1</sub> maps, while the lesion tissue was segmented manually. Correlations between disease duration and lesion load were performed to investigate any existing relationship to image contrast. The primary findings of this work include statistically significant decreases in the rNOE pool for the normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) (11.4% decrease) and normal-appearing grey matter (NAGM) (10.6% decrease) in multiple sclerosis subjects compared to healthy controls. Additionally, a significant decrease in the amine pool was also observed for NAWM (15.3% decrease) in multiple sclerosis subjects compared to healthy controls. Changes in multiple sclerosis lesion contrast were also observed for several pools (DS, amine, and rNOE). Decreases in both the rNOE and amine pools suggest that in multiple sclerosis, there are diffuse decreases in mobile lipids, such as those found in neuronal cell bodies, as well as a decrease in proteins with amine groups. Furthermore, these measurable contrast changes were not detected in the corresponding T<sub>1</sub> maps. NOE imaging can provide complementary metabolic information to conventional MRI methods. Future studies will focus on utilizing this technique for longitudinal tracking of disease progression and investigating similar demyelinating diseases."

Rituximab is commonly used in its treatment however many patients do not respond. Obinutuzumab is a novel anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody for which there is increasing observational evidence in treatment-resistant membranous nephropathy. The majority of evidence for its use relates to anti-phospholipase A2 receptor-(PLA2R) associated membranous nephropathy. This was a single-centre case-series of all patients at a tertiary nephrology centre in Melbourne, Australia, treated with Obinutuzumab for membranous nephropathy, between January 2023 and June 2024. All patients who received Obinutuzumab were included in this case-series, irrespective of PLA2R status. Out of 5 patients with treatment-resistant membranous nephropathy, 3 had PLA2R-associated membranous nephropathy which had previously been refractory to, or relapsed on Rituximab therapy. All 3 patients with PLA2R-positive membranous nephropathy achieved complete immunological and clinical remission after receiving Obinutuzumab. The case of secondary PLA2R-negative membranous nephropathy only achieved partial remission after Obinutuzumab before unexpectedly dying from another cause. The case of recurrent PLA2R-associated membranous nephropathy in a renal allograft did not respond to Obinutuzumab. This case-series supports the existing evidence in favour of Obinutuzumab for treatment-resistant PLA2R-associated membranous nephropathy. To our knowledge it is the first reported use of Obinutuzumab in sarcoidosis-associated membranous nephropathy."

    "abstract": "Identification of COPD disease-causing genes is an important tool for understanding why COPD develops, who is at highest COPD risk and how new COPD treatments can be developed. Previous COPD genetic studies have identified a highly significant genetic association near <i>NPNT</i> (nephronectin), a gene involved in tissue repair, but the biological mechanisms underlying this association are unknown. Splicing quantitative trait locus (sQTL) analysis was performed to identify common genetic variants that alter RNA splicing in lung tissues. These lung sQTL signals were compared to COPD genetic association results near the <i>NPNT</i> gene using colocalisation analysis to determine whether genetic risk for COPD in this region may act through altered splicing. Long-read sequencing characterised COPD-associated splicing events at isoform-level resolution and <i>in silico</i> protein structural analysis identified likely functional effects of this alternative splicing. An established COPD genetic risk variant, rs34712979-A, creates a cryptic splice acceptor site that causes four separate splicing changes in <i>NPNT</i>. The only one of these splicing changes that was associated with COPD phenotypes involved a cassette exon (exon 3). Long-read RNA sequencing demonstrated that the COPD risk allele causes a shift in isoform usage away from the dominant <i>NPNT</i> isoform B precursor, which excludes exon 3, to the isoform A precursor, which splices-in exon 3. AlphaFold protein structural analysis reveals that inclusion of this exon disrupts an epidermal growth factor-like functional domain in NPNT. Genetic variants in the <i>NPNT</i> gene increase COPD risk by changing RNA splicing of <i>NPNT</i> in the lung."

Some mutations in ATP7B are presumed to be pathogenic by altering pre-mRNA splicing, while most have not been functionally verified. This study aimed to perform functional studies to verify the pathogenicity of variants that may affect pre-mRNA splicing. We recruited 42 pediatric patients who were clinically diagnosed with WD (Leipzig score â¥ 4) and underwent ATP7B gene sequencing. We leveraged in silico analysis and prioritized seven splice genic variants in ATP7B. Minigene assays were used to evaluate the effects of the selected variants on transcript splicing. Total RNA was extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) was performed on samples from several patients to verify the splicing alterations. This study screened 42 distinct mutations for their potential effects on splicing based on in silico analysis and functional verification. Five intronic variants (c.1286-1delG, c.1543 + 1G > T, c.1708-1G > C, c.1870-8A > G, and c.2121 + 3A > T) and one missense variant (c.2120A > G) were proved to alter the splicing of ATP7B transcription by minigene assays. The transcript assays demonstrated splicing changes in vivo in patient PBMCs for c.3993 T > G. The altered transcription products resulting from c.2570_2572del were confirmed by sequencing. This study adds experimental evidence to genetic diagnosis based on assessing the genetic defects of 42 pediatric WD patients and provides new insights into the pathogenicity of the splicing variants."

Its diverse clinical presentation, particularly in paediatric patients, poses a significant diagnostic challenge. We present a unique case of a 10-year-old boy initially misdiagnosed with immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) and haemolytic anaemia, later diagnosed with WD after extensive evaluation. The patient's condition progressed to liver cirrhosis, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and multisystem organ failure despite prompt initiation of copper-chelating therapy. This case underscores the importance of considering WD in paediatric patients with unexplained liver dysfunction, haemolysis, or hepatosplenomegaly, even in the absence of classic neurological symptoms or Kayser-Fleischer rings. The Wilson disease scoring system proved valuable in this atypical presentation, guiding diagnosis and management. This report highlights the need for heightened awareness, early diagnosis, and a multidisciplinary approach in managing WD, particularly in its advanced stages."

    "abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is one of the most sex-polarized psychiatric disorders, with women exhibiting twice the prevalence of men. The biological mechanisms underlying this sex disparity are not fully understood. Growing evidence suggests that alterations of the stress-buffering endocannabinoid (eCB) system and heightened inflammation are central to PTSD pathophysiology and may contribute to sex-biases in PTSD risk and severity. Here, we examined sex-differences in levels of circulating eCBs and peripheral pro-inflammatory markers in a cohort of men and women with PTSD and non-psychiatric controls. 88 individuals with PTSD and 85 sex- and age- matched controls (HC) were retrospectively selected from the Mass General Brigham Biobank. Serum was assayed to measure circulating eCBs [anandamide (AEA), 2-arachidonyl glycerol (2-AG), oleoylethanolamide (OEA), and arachidonic acid (AA] and inflammatory markers [interleukin-1Î² (IL-1Î²), IL-6, IL-8, IL-18, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFÎ±), and C-reactive Protein (CRP)]. Linear regression was used to predict differential abundance of each analyte by disease state (PTSD/HC) within the male and female subgroups. Two-sided t-tests with Benjamini-Hochberg correction were used to examine differences across subgroups. Analyses were repeated in those with comorbid major depressive disorder. Male PTSD patients showed a significant decrease in AEA, AA and OEA levels compared to male controls (<i>p</i>'s < .001) and to female subgroups (PTSD and HCs) (<i>p< .001</i>). In contrast, among females, PTSD patients showed elevated levels of IL-6 (<i>p<.05</i>) and IL-8 (<i>p<.05</i>). Both male and female PTSD patients exhibited an increase in TNFÎ± concentrations (<i>p<.05</i>), compared to HCs. Similar results were obtained in the subgroup of individuals with comorbid MDD and after controlling for the <i>FAAH</i> 385A genotype. Our findings show for the first time that decrease in eCB levels is absent in women with PTSD, who in turn exhibit a broader increase in inflammatory markers, thus suggesting that biological perturbations underlying PTSD may vary by sex."

The UK IPF Registry is a national, multicentre observational registry, including both prospective and retrospective data of patients with IPF in secondary or tertiary care. Cases eligible for inclusion were those with a diagnosis of IPF, presenting at participating centres from January 2013. Between January 2013 and February 2023, 5052 IPF cases were registered from 64 participating centres. There was a male preponderance (77.8%) with meanÂ±SD age of 74Â±8.1 years, 66% were ex-smokers and 76% had at least one comorbidity. Over a third (36.7%) experienced symptoms for more than 24 months prior to their first clinic visit.

The Wilson score and the gamma distribution method were used to calculate the 95% confidence interval (95% <i>CI</i>). <b>Results:</b> The rates of consultation, referral, diagnosis, and treatment did not increase significantly following the intervention in the hospital for hepatitis C, and there was no statistically significant difference compared with the data before the intervention. <b>Conclusion:</b> The vast majority of anti-HCV-positive patients in non-infectious and a few infectious disease departments did not receive timely disease assessment, referral, diagnosis, and treatment because hospitals lacked a standard, consistent, and stringent whole management process for hepatitis C screening, thereby causing missed detection, diagnosis, and treatment."

    "title": "Isotype diversity of antibodies specific for component allergens in the context of allergic diseases: eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), asthma, and the alpha-gal syndrome (AGS).",
    "abstract": "From the earliest days of studying the reagins in allergic sera that give rise to the Prausnitz-Kuestner reaction, there was evidence that there were other types of antibodies (Ab) specific for allergens, particularly those induced by immunotherapy. By 1980, not only was IgE recognized and could be measured, but the presence of other isotypes including IgG and IgA in patients with IgE was well established. From that time onwards the development of monoclonal antibodies made it possible to distinguish and measure antibodies of other isotypes such as IgG4, IgG2, and IgG3. Over the past 40 years two things have dominated the field- firstly, the techniques for measuring isotype specific antibodies to allergens have improved steadily. Secondly, several different allergic diseases or phenomena have been identified in which isotype diversity of the antibodies has become a major issue. Prior to 1990 only occasional cases of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) had been identified, but since then they have become common. Most of the cases have positive skin tests and/or IgE Ab to cow's milk or wheat, but it became obvious that most cases of EoE are not primarily related to IgE. Today it is clear that IgG4 Ab to these allergens play a significant role in cases of EoE. In 2000 the first reports of children developing tolerance to cat allergen appeared. Today it is clear that this tolerance depends on high levels of IgG4 antibodies and there is increasing evidence that the IgG4 response is primarily against <i>Fel d 1</i>. The most recent novel allergic disease is the alpha-gal syndrome (AGS). This condition is based on IgE antibodies specific for the oligosaccharide galactose alpha,1-3-galactose, which are primarily induced by tick bites. However, in this case it was already well known that all immunocompetent primates have made IgG and IgM antibodies to this oligosaccharide. Furthermore, it is not clear whether the IgG isotypes, particularly IgG1 and IgG3, play a role in the inflammatory response to the oligosaccharide. Overall, it is clear that current and future investigation of allergic diseases requires careful assessment of allergen specific antibodies of diverse isotypes in addition to IgE."

    "abstract": "Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, with coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) playing a crucial role in its diagnosis. The mean Hounsfield unit (HU) of pericoronary adipose tissue (PCAT) is linked to cardiovascular risk. We utilized a self-supervised learning framework (SSL) to improve the accuracy and generalizability of coronary artery segmentation on CCTA volumes while addressing the limitations of small-annotated datasets. We utilized self-supervised pretraining followed by supervised fine-tuning to segment coronary arteries. To evaluate the data efficiency of SSL, we varied the number of CCTA volumes used during pretraining. In addition, we developed an automated PCAT segmentation algorithm utilizing centerline extraction, spatial-geometric coronary identification, and landmark detection. We evaluated our method on a multi-institutional dataset by assessing coronary artery and PCAT segmentation accuracy via Dice scores and comparing mean PCAT HU values with the ground truth. Our approach significantly improved coronary artery segmentation, achieving Dice scores up to 0.787 after self-supervised pretraining. The automated PCAT segmentation achieved near-perfect performance, with <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mrow><mi>R</mi></mrow> </math> -squared values of 0.9998 for both the left anterior descending artery and the right coronary artery indicating excellent agreement between predicted and actual mean PCAT HU values. Self-supervised pretraining notably enhanced model generalizability on external datasets, improving overall segmentation accuracy. We demonstrate the potential of SSL to advance CCTA image analysis, enabling more accurate CAD diagnostics. Our findings highlight the robustness of SSL for automated coronary artery and PCAT segmentation, offering promising advancements in cardiovascular care."

We present immune lymphocyte estimation from nucleotide sequencing (ImmuneLENS), which estimates T cell and B cell fractions, class switching and clonotype diversity from whole-genome sequencing data at depths as low as 5Ã coverage. By applying ImmuneLENS to the 100,000 Genomes Project, we identify genes enriched with somatic mutations in T cell-rich tumors, significant sex-based differences in circulating T cell fraction and demonstrated that the circulating T cell fraction in patients with cancer is significantly lower than in healthy individuals. Low circulating B cell fraction was linked to increased cancer incidence. Finally, circulating T cell abundance was more prognostic of 5-year cancer survival than infiltrating T cells."

    "abstract": "Temperature is a marker of inflammation. Research has shown that by measuring skin surface temperature in those with a history of diabetic foot ulceration (DFU), tissue damage can be identified early and reduce rates of subsequent DFU. This study considered whether measuring skin surface temperature using infra-red thermometry can identify early tissue damage and inform clinical practice in a general population with Diabetes Mellitus (DM). The data presented was taken from a prospective observational study of risk factors in patients with Diabetes. As part of this study, temperature measurements using the Flir E6 Infra-red camera were taken from 216 individuals attending outpatient diabetes clinics in a large urban teaching hospital in Ireland as part of a comprehensive diabetic foot assessment. Measurements were taken at foot sites associated with increased risk at baseline received repeat temperature measurement on 2 subsequent occasions in the following week. Any ulceration was subsequently recorded. Discussion: Of the 216 participants, 4 % (n = 9) developed visual ulceration within 7 days. All of these had been identified at high risk at baseline assessment and had a history of foot disease. A temperature differential of â¥2.2 Â°C between sites of interest was recorded. Temperature ranges varied from 29.1 Â°C to 37.6 Â°C. High temperature was considered if over 35 Â°C. Of those who developed a diabetic foot ulceration within the 7 day follow up period, 78 % (n = 7) had a high temperature. The remaining 22 % (n = 2) who developed ulceration had a temperature reading in the normal range. Elevated skin surface temperature was seen prior to the development of DFU in all cases in this study. Initial analysis suggests that neither the 35 Â°C threshold nor a 2.2 Â°C temperature difference is indicative of inevitable tissue damage in this population due to the high number of false positives seen."

It is also being developed for the treatment of solid tumors, autoimmune disorders, heart disease, and aging. Despite unprecedented clinical outcomes, CAR-T and other engineered cell therapies face a variety of manufacturing and safety challenges. Traditional methods, such as lentivirus transduction and electroporation, result in random integration or cause significant cellular damage, which can limit the safety and efficacy of engineered cell therapies. We present hydroporation as a gentle and effective alternative for intracellular delivery. Hydroporation resulted in 1.7- to 2-fold higher CAR-T yields compared to electroporation with superior cell viability and recovery. Hydroporated cells exhibited rapid proliferation, robust target cell lysis, and increased pro-inflammatory and regulatory cytokine secretion in addition to improved CAR-T yield by day 5 post-transfection. We demonstrate that scaled-up hydroporation can process 5 Ã 10<sup>8</sup> cells in less than 10 s, showcasing the platform as a viable solution for high-yield CAR-T manufacturing with the potential for improved therapeutic outcomes."

    "abstract": "To evaluate how postmortem anthropometric malnutrition (PAM) measures align with expert panel attribution of malnutrition as a causal or significant condition in under-5 mortality (U5M). Cohort study using data from the Child Health and Mortality Prevention Surveillance network, incorporating clinical records, postmortem anthropometrics, minimally invasive tissue sampling, clinical abstraction and verbal autopsy to determine multiple causes of death. 1405 deaths of children aged 1-59 months from six African countries between 2016 and 2023. PAM was determined using z-scores from the WHO Child Growth Standards: underweight (weight-for-age<(-2)), wasting (arm circumference-for-age or weight-for-length<(-2)) and stunting (length-for-age <(-2)). Performance metrics (sensitivity (SE), specificity (SP) and positive predictive values (PPV)) were calculated to determine the alignment between PAM and expert panel attribution of malnutrition as a causal or significant condition to death. Nearly 75% of cases demonstrated moderate-to-severe malnutrition by PAM, while expert panels attributed malnutrition in 41% of cases. Performance metrics varied across anthropometric indices: underweight exhibited the highest SE (89.7%), while wasting based on arm circumference had the highest SP (81.9%) and PPV (76.8%). Discrepancies between PAM classification and expert panel attribution differed significantly by site, age, location of death and preventability of death (p<0.05). Adjusted multivariate regression showed that expert panel attribution was more likely with increasing severity of PAM. The proportion of U5M attributable to malnutrition ranged between 41% (expert panel attribution) and 74% (PAM). Variability in classification underscores the need for monitoring and quality improvement measures to address discrepancies. Improved alignment between PAM and panel assessments is essential for accurately identifying malnutrition-related deaths and designing effective interventions to reduce U5M."

    "abstract": "Tuberculous meningitis (TBM)-related deaths occur early, often within weeks after initiation of treatment. Enhanced treatment early in the disease course with agents that effectively penetrate the central nervous system may improve outcomes in TBM. We conducted a phase 2, open-label, randomized trial in Masaka, Uganda to assess the safety and tolerability of linezolid 1200 mg versus no linezolid with high (35 mg/kg/day) or standard-dose (10 mg/kg/day) rifampin for 4 weeks in participants with definite or suspected TBM. The primary endpoint was any >grade 3 adverse event during the interventional period. Secondary endpoints included overall survival and functional independence adjusted for TBM disease grade. We randomized 40 participants (98% with HIV). One-fourth had microbiologically-confirmed TBM. Nearly 75% had moderate to severe disease (Medical Research Council grades II and III). No significant difference in >grade 3 adverse event-free survival was observed across the 4 treatment arms (p=0.18), or by linezolid (p=0.97) or rifampin (p=0.46) group. More favorable overall survival (OR 0.28 for death at 12 weeks, p=0.10; OR 0.43 at 24 weeks, p=0.24) and functional outcome [OR 2.22 for lower modified Rankin Scale score (i.e., less disability) at 12 weeks, p=0.18; OR 2.00 at 24 weeks, p=0.24) were observed in the linezolid group. The addition of a short course of linezolid to treat predominantly moderate to severe TBM in adults with HIV did not introduce excess toxicity. Our findings add to growing evidence that linezolid is a safe and acceptable treatment for TBM that merits further investigation in larger multi-site trials."

    "abstract": "Chest radiotherapy (XRT) plays a crucial role in the treatment of a multitude of cancers including breast, lung, esophageal, and lymphoma. Although XRT enhances cancer survival rates, it may also expose healthy bystander tissues to radiation, potentially leading to severe complications. Initially considered relatively resistant to radiation damage, the heart has been shown over the past 4 decades to be susceptible to radiation-induced cardiovascular toxicity and despite advances in XRT which can minimize radiation exposure to heart tissue, no cardiac radiation dose is entirely safe. The clinical spectrum of radiation-induced cardiovascular toxicity is broad, encompassing coronary artery disease, myocardial dysfunction, valvular abnormalities, and pericardial disorders. Radiation-induced cardiovascular toxicity may manifest acutely or many years after XRT, with each condition more likely to present at certain time points post-XRT. Cardiac imaging is a crucial tool in both the screening and diagnosis of radiation-induced cardiovascular toxicity with an understanding of its pathophysiology, incidence, and progression required to implement a comprehensive, multimodality imaging approach to detect and manage these complications effectively."

We also review reported cases and proposed mechanisms explaining copper-induced renal toxicity's role in the clinical presentation. In our cohort, nephrolithiasis was detected via abdominal ultrasound in 10% of patients. Although hypercalciuria and acid-base abnormalities associated with WD have been reported in the literature, such findings were not observed in metabolic evaluations performed late in the disease course among our WD patients with kidney stones. Recognizing the less acknowledged renal manifestations of WD highlights the importance of comprehensive evaluations and timely therapeutic interventions to prevent complications and improve outcomes in WD."

    "abstract": "Fusarium circinatum, the causal agent of pine pitch canker, is one of the most destructive pathogens of Pinus species worldwide. Infections by this pathogen result in serious mortality of seedlings due to root and root collar disease, and growth reduction in trees due to canker formation and dieback. Although much is known about the population biology, genetics, and genomics of F. circinatum, relatively little is known regarding the molecular basis of pathogenicity in F. circinatum. In this study, a protoplast-based transformation using CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genome editing was utilized to functionally characterize a putative pathogenicity gene in three different strains of the fungus. In silico analyses suggested the gene likely encodes a small secreted protein, and all isolates in which it was deleted displayed significantly reduced vegetative growth and asexual spore production compared to the wild-type isolates. In pathogenicity tests, lesions induced by the deletion mutants on detached Pinus patula branches were significantly shorter than those produced by the wild-types. The putative pathogenicity gene was named Pgs reflecting its role in pathogenicity, growth, and sporulation. Future research will seek to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying the mutant phenotypes observed. Overall, this study represents a significant advance in F. circinatum research as the development and application of a Cas9-mediated gene deletion process opens new avenues for functional gene characterization underlying many of the pathogen's biological traits."

    "abstract": "Insulin resistance and inflammation are components of a biological framework that is hypothesised to be shared by type 2 diabetes and depression. However, depressive symptoms include a large heterogeneity of somatic and cognitive-affective symptoms, and this may obscure the associations within this biological framework. Cross-sectional and longitudinal data were used to disentangle the contributions of insulin resistance and inflammation to somatic and cognitive-affective symptoms of depression. This secondary analysis used data from the Emotional Distress Sub-Study of the GRADE trial. Insulin resistance and inflammation were assessed using the HOMA-IR estimation and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) levels, respectively, at baseline and at the study visits at year 1 and year 3 (HOMA-IR) and every 6 months (hsCRP) for up to 3 years of follow-up. Depressive symptoms were assessed at baseline using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8), and a total score as well as symptom cluster scores for cognitive-affective and somatic symptoms were calculated. For the cross-sectional analyses, linear regression analyses were performed, with inflammation and insulin resistance at baseline as dependent variables. For the longitudinal analyses, linear mixed-effect regression analyses were performed, with inflammation and insulin resistance at the various time points as dependent variables. In all analyses, depressive symptoms (total score and symptom cluster scores) were the independent variables, controlled for important demographic, anthropometric and metabolic confounders. For the analysis of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), data from 1321 participants were analysed. For the analysis of inflammation (hsCRP), data from 1739 participants were analysed. In cross-sectional analysis and after adjustment for potential confounders, a one-unit increase in PHQ-8 total score was significantly associated with a 0.8% increase in HOMA-IR (p=0.007), but not with hsCRP (0.6% increase, p=0.283). The somatic symptom score was associated with a 5.8% increase in HOMA-IR (p=0.004). Single-item analyses of depressive symptoms showed that fatigue (3.6% increase, p=0.002) and increased/decreased appetite (3.5% increase, p=0.009) were significantly associated with HOMA-IR cross-sectionally. The cognitive-affective symptom score was not significantly associated with HOMA-IR at baseline. In longitudinal analyses, a one-unit increase in PHQ-8 total score was significantly associated with a 0.8% increase in hsCRP over time (p=0.014), but not with HOMA-IR over time (0.1% decrease, p=0.564). Again, only the somatic symptom cluster was significantly associated with hsCRP over time (5.2% increase, p=0.017), while the cognitive-affective symptom score was not. The results highlight the associations of depressive symptoms with markers of inflammation and insulin resistance, both cross-sectionally and longitudinally, in individuals with type 2 diabetes. In particular, somatic symptoms of depression appear to be the driver of these associations, even after controlling for concomitant conditions, with a potential role for fatigue and issues with appetite.

    "abstract": "Non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding (NVUGIB) is a common cause of hospitalization and associated morbidity and mortality. Bariatric surgery is a widely performed category of gastrointestinal (GI) surgery that attempts to induce weight loss by reconstructing the upper GI tract. Bleeding is a common complication of bariatric surgery; however, limited research exists on outcomes for these patients when admitted for NVUGIB compared to those without a history of bariatric surgery. Our study aims to evaluate the outcomes of post-bariatric surgery patients (PBSPs) admitted with NVUGIB over a 13-year span. The National Inpatient Sample (NIS) from 2008 to 2020 was used to identify patients over 18 years old admitted for NVUGIB using the International Classification of Disease (ICD), 9<sup>th</sup> revision (ICD-9) and 10<sup>th</sup> revision (ICD-10) codes. Records were weighted using the algorithms provided by the NIS. Primary outcomes of interest were all-cause hospital mortality, shock, acute myocardial infarction (AMI), acute kidney injury (AKI), and a composite of these. Groups were defined based on the history of bariatric surgery, and demographics and incidence of comorbidities were compared. Outcomes were compared between the two groups, and odds ratios (ORs) were calculated using two-stage weighted logistic regression. ORs were adjusted for common co-founders such as age, gender, race, Charlson comorbidity index (CCI), region, hospital size, hospital teaching status, elective <i>vs.</i> emergency admission, and income quartile. A total of 2,231,826 patients admitted for NVUGIB were included in this study. Of these, 28,167 had a history of bariatric surgery. Overall, bariatric surgery patients were younger, less complicated (CCI: 2.71 <i>vs.</i> 4.76), had a shorter length of stay (LOS), and were less likely to be on Medicare/Medicaid than those without a history of bariatric surgery (P<0.05). Several comorbidities were more common in patients without a history of bariatric surgery, including coronary artery disease, hyperlipidemia (HLD), congestive heart failure (CHF), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and liver cirrhosis (P<0.05). Other comorbidities were more common in the post-bariatric surgery group, including gastroesophageal reflux disease and anemia (P<0.05). We found that patients admitted for NVUGIB with a history of bariatric surgery had significantly lower odds of all outcomes, including all-cause mortality (OR =0.48; P<0.001), AKI (OR =0.71; P<0.001), AMI (OR =0.62; P<0.05), shock (OR =0.88; P<0.05), and a composite of these four (OR =0.77; P<0.001). Our study found that patients with NVUGIB and a history of bariatric surgery had substantially decreased odds of mortality, AMI, shock, and AKI compared to patients without a history of bariatric surgery. This suggests that patients with a history of bariatric surgery experienced more minor bleeds than other patients. Further studies are therefore warranted to understand the postoperative risk of bariatric surgery."

    "abstract": "Methionine aminopeptidase 2 (MetAP2) plays an important role in the regulation of protein synthesis and post-translational processing. Preclinical/clinical applications of MetAP2 inhibitors for the treatment of various diseases have been explored because of their antiangiogenic, anticancer, antiobesity, antidiabetic, and immunosuppressive properties. However, the effects of MetAP2 inhibitors on CNS diseases are rarely examined despite the abundant presence of MetAP2 in the brain. Previously, we synthesized a novel boron-containing MetAP2 inhibitor, BL6, and found that it suppressed angiogenesis and adipogenesis yet improved glucose uptake. Here, we studied the anti-inflammatory effects of BL6 in SIM-A9 microglia and in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease generated by the intracerebroventricular (icv) injection of streptozotocin (STZ). We found that BL6 reduced proinflammatory molecules, such as nitric oxide, iNOS, IL-1Î², and IL-6, together with phospho-Akt and phospho-NF-ÎºB p65, which were elevated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated microglial SIM-A9 cells. However, the LPS-induced reduction in Arg-1 and CD206 was attenuated by BL6, suggesting that BL6 promotes microglial M1 to M2 polarization. BL6 also decreased glial activation along with a reduction in phospho-tau and an elevation in synaptophysin in the icv-STZ mouse model. Thus, our experiments demonstrate an anti-neuroinflammatory action of BL6, suggesting possible clinical applications of MetAP2 inhibitors for brain disorders in which neuroinflammation is involved."

As PCAT is vascularly connected with coronary vasculature, the presence of iodine is a potential confounding factor on PCAT HU and textures that has not been adequately investigated. We aim to use dynamic cardiac CT perfusion (CCTP) to understand the perfusion of PCAT and determine its effects on PCAT assessment. <b>Methods</b>: From CCTP, we analyzed HU dynamics of territory-specific PCAT, the myocardium, and other adipose depots in patients with coronary artery disease. HU, blood flow, and radiomics were assessed over time. Changes from peak aorta time, P<sub>a</sub>, chosen to model the acquisition time of CCTA, were obtained. <b>Results</b>: HU in PCAT increased more than in other adipose depots. Blood flow in PCAT was ~23% of that in the contiguous myocardium. A two-second offset [before, after] P<sub>a</sub> resulted in [4 Â± 1.1 HU, 3 Â± 1.5 HU] differences in PCAT, giving a 7 HU swing. Due to changes in HU, the apparent PCAT volume reduced by ~15% from the first scan (P<sub>1</sub>) to P<sub>a</sub> using a conventional fat window. Comparing radiomic features over time, 78% of features changed >10% relative to P<sub>1</sub>. Distal and proximal to a significant stenosis, we found less enhancement and longer time-to-peak distally in PCAT. <b>Conclusions</b>: CCTP elucidates blood flow in PCAT and enables the analysis of PCAT features over time. PCAT assessments (HU, apparent volume, and radiomics) are sensitive to acquisition timing and obstructive stenosis, which may confound the interpretation of PCAT in CCTA images. Data normalization may be in order."

    "title": "ZEB2 Gene Pathogenic Variants Across Protein-Coding Regions and Impact on Clinical Manifestations: A Review.",
    "abstract": "Mowat-Wilson syndrome (MWS) is a rare multi-system genetic disorder caused by variants in the Zinc Finger E-Box-Binding Homeobox 2 (ZEB2) gene. ZEB2 is an autosomal dominant gene containing ten exons within the canonical version transcript (Isoform: O60315-1). The ZEB2 gene encodes six functional domains and seven non-domain regions. This review provides a comprehensive summary of pathogenic variants and their associated MWS clinical characteristics, focusing on ZEB2 pathogenic variants, functional protein domains and non-domain regions with clinical features. A systematic literature search from 2001 to 2023 and of unpublished datasets found 191 individuals with reported clinical features and genotypic data. Genetic defects and clinical manifestations were examined that presumably impact on the structure and function of the ZEB2 gene, thereby causing multiple developmental defects with corresponding clinical presentation. This study found more nonsense ZEB2 variants observed within exon 8, which encodes four of the six protein domains: the CtBP-interacting domain (CID), homeodomain (HD), SMAD-binding domain (SMD or SBD) and part of the N-terminal zinc finger cluster (N-ZF), suggesting exon 8 plays a crucial role in this protein structure and function with multi-organ involvement. Exon 8 defects were found to be statistically more represented for gastrointestinal findings when compared to other exons, while frameshift defects were more often seen for the typical MWS face in non-domain protein regions. In contrast, nonsense or other types of variants in exons 3, 4 and 5 which encode only flanking non-domain regions were observed more often, compared with other exons excluding exon 8, to be specifically involved in the MWS facial gestalt, brain malformations, developmental delay and intellectual disability. Deleterious ZEB2 frameshift (45%) and nonsense (38%) gene variants were most often observed with deletions at 6% and missense at 5%. The genotype and clinical relationships in MWS can provide insights into prognosis, morbidity, clinical surveillance strategies and counseling of family members."

Sex differences in CSVD imaging markers and prevalence of CAA vs HA in lobar ICH remain unexplored. We performed a retrospective analysis of patients with primary lobar ICH who underwent MRI during hospitalization. We collected demographic, clinical, and outcome data. We reviewed MRIs for CSVD markers and calculated composite CSVD burden score (cCSVDbs). We assigned possible/probable CAA using Boston criteria 2.0. We grouped patients based on their sex and examined associations between sex and CSVD markers, cCSVDbs, or CAA. Kaplan Meier survival analysis was used to determine ICH-onset age among patients with first-ever symptomatic lobar ICH. 214 patients were included (102 [47.66%] women). Men were more likely to be current alcohol abusers (25.69% vs. 9.09%, p = 0.002), current smokers (24.30% vs. 12.12%, p = 0.024) and have coronary artery disease (26.79% vs. 15.69%, p = 0.048), and hyperglycemia on admission (142.79 Â± 59.59 vs. 126.58 Â± 37.29, p = 0.019). Women were older (74.91 Â± 11.69 vs. 69.28 Â± 14.53 years, p = 0.002), and more likely to have possible/probable CAA in univariate (97.06% vs. 88.39%; OR: 4.33, 95% CI: 1.19-15.67; p = 0.025) but not multivariate analysis. We found no significant differences in MRI markers of CSVD, cCSVDbs, or CAA. Among patients who presented with their first-ever primary symptomatic lobar ICH (n = 187), men were younger than women (73 vs 77 years, p = 0.001). In our cohort of patients with primary lobar ICH, we found no significant difference in clinical and imaging characteristics between sexes. However, men were more likely to have a younger lobar ICH-onset age compared to women."

    "abstract": "To estimate intention to receive newly introduced adult vaccines among community members and healthcare workers (HCWs) in Lusaka, Zambia in the context of previous COVID-19 vaccine uptake and perceived disease threat and, identify trusted sources of vaccine information. We conducted a cross-sectional survey among a random sample of community members and a convenience sample of HCWs from 13 November to 15 December 2023. We evaluated future vaccination intentions by self-reported COVID-19 vaccine uptake, community role, vaccine type (COVID-19 booster, HIV, tuberculosis, malaria, pneumonia, diarrheal disease) and source of information using adjusted, mixed effects Poisson regression and adjusted probability models. We enrolled 395 (79.2 %) community members and 104 (20.8 %) HCWs (N = 499). There was high intention to receive new vaccines among community members (mean score = 83.6 %) and HCWs (mean score = 86.0 %), though intentions varied by vaccine type. Prior COVID-19 vaccine uptake (0, 1, 2+ doses) impacted intentions to receive a novel COVID-19 vaccine among community members (43.3 %, 62.8 %, 79.7 %, respectively) but were not associated with any other vaccine types. Intention to receive a vaccine was strongly associated with perceived disease severity and susceptibility as well as age, sex, education, and household income. Social media as a vaccine information source was associated with lower overall vaccine intention among community members, while health system and community sources were associated with higher overall intention to receive new vaccines. Government was a highly trusted source of vaccine information among all participants. Prior COVID-19 vaccination uptake did not predict future non-COVID-19 vaccine intention in Zambia. Perceived threat and select socio-demographic factors were key predictors, suggesting the need for rapid research to design communication strategies and identify trusted sources per target population."

    "abstract": "Our objective was to determine the prevalence and clinical characteristics of vasculitis in Alaska Native and American Indian (AN/AI) peoples of Alaska. We queried the electronic health records of participating tribal health organizations within the Alaska Tribal Health System (ATHS) to identify adults with diagnostic codes related to vasculitis. Medical record abstraction was performed for all adults with potential vasculitis to confirm fulfillment of inclusion criteria, subtype, and clinical characteristics. The denominator for prevalence was the 2019 ATHS user population â¥ 18 (except giant cell arteritis [GCA], defined for persons â¥ 50). The age-adjusted prevalence per 1,000,000 AN/AI adults was 752 (95% confidence interval [CI] 581-959) for all vasculitis, with systemic vasculitis being the most common at 518 (95% CI 379-695). The most prevalent types of systemic vasculitis were antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis (AAV) at 340 per million adults (95% CI 230-488) and GCA at 28 per 100,000 â¥ 50 (95% CI 12-56). The most prevalent subtype of AAV was granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) at 244 per million adults (95% CI 148-380). AAV was diagnosed at a mean age of 54.2 years (SD 17), often with high markers of inflammation and renal involvement. GCA was diagnosed at a mean age of 69.6 years (SD 9.2). The prevalence of AAV (especially GPA) in AN/AI peoples is high. GCA prevalence is lower than White populations, but higher than many other populations. AN/AI peoples with AAV and GCA may present at younger ages with more severe disease than other populations."

    "abstract": "We aimed to assess whether continuous glucose monitor (CGM) metrics can accurately predict stage 3 type 1 diabetes diagnosis in those with islet autoantibodies (AAb). Baseline CGM data were collected from participants with â¥1 positive AAb type from five studies: ASK (n=79), BDR (n=22), DAISY (n=18), DIPP (n=8) and TrialNet Pathway to Prevention (n=91). Median follow-up time was 2.6 years (quartiles: 1.5 to 3.6 years). A participant characteristics-only model, a CGM metrics-only model and a full model combining characteristics and CGM metrics were compared. The full model achieved a numerically higher performance predictor estimate (C statistic=0.74; 95% CI 0.66, 0.81) for predicting stage 3 type 1 diabetes diagnosis compared with the characteristics-only model (C statistic=0.69; 95% CI 0.60, 0.77) and the CGM-only model (C statistic=0.68; 95% CI 0.61, 0.75). Greater percentage of time >7.8 mmol/l (p<0.001), HbA<sub>1c</sub> (p=0.02), having a first-degree relative with type 1 diabetes (p=0.02) and testing positive for IA-2 AAb (p<0.001) were associated with greater risk of type 1 diabetes diagnosis. Additionally, being male (p=0.06) and having a negative GAD AAb (p=0.09) were selected but not found to be significant. Participants classified as having low (n=79), medium (n=98) or high (n=41) risk of stage 3 type 1 diabetes diagnosis using the full model had a probability of developing symptomatic disease by 2 years of 5%, 13% and 48%, respectively. CGM metrics can help predict disease progression and classify an individual's risk of type 1 diabetes diagnosis in conjunction with other factors. CGM can also be used to better assess the risk of type 1 diabetes progression and define eligibility for potential prevention trials."

    "abstract": "Nearly 70 years after studies first showed that the offspring of vitamin A (retinol, ROL)-deficient rats exhibit structural cardiac defects and over 20 years since the role of vitamin A's potent bioactive metabolite hormone, all<i>-</i>trans retinoic acid (ATRA), was elucidated in embryonic cardiac development, the role of the vitamin A metabolites, or retinoids, in adult heart physiology and heart and vascular disease, remains poorly understood. Studies have shown that low serum levels of retinoic acid correlate with higher all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, though the relationship between circulating retinol and ATRA levels, cardiac tissue ATRA levels, and intracellular cardiac ATRA signaling in the context of heart and vascular disease has only begun to be addressed. We have recently shown that patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy show a nearly 40% decline of in situ cardiac ATRA levels, despite adequate local stores of retinol. Moreover, we and others have shown that the administration of ATRA forestalls the development of heart failure (HF) in rodent models. In this review, we summarize key facets of retinoid metabolism and signaling and discuss mechanisms by which impaired ATRA signaling contributes to several HF hallmarks including hypertrophy, contractile dysfunction, poor calcium handling, redox imbalance, and fibrosis. We highlight unresolved issues in cardiac ATRA metabolism whose pursuit will help refine therapeutic strategies aimed at restoring ATRA homeostasis."

Fifty-five unrelated children with a clinical diagnosis of Wilson disease (WD) were recruited. Deoxyribonucleic acid was extracted from peripheral blood samples, and variants in the <i>ATP7B</i> gene were identified using next-generation sequencing. Seventy-six deleterious variants were detected in 97 out of 110 alleles of the <i>ATP7B</i> gene. Thirty (54.5%) patients had 2 disease-causing variants (15 homozygous and 15 compound heterozygous). Twelve (21.8%) patients had one disease-causing variant and one variant of uncertain significance (VUS) with potential pathogenicity. Thirteen (23.6%) patients were carriers of a single disease-causing variant. The most frequent variants, c.3305T>C and c.956delC, were detected in 4 alleles each, followed by c.3741-3742dupCA and c.3694A>C, which were detected in 3 alleles each. Among the 76 variants, 42 were missense, 13 were stop-gain, 9 were frameshift, 1 was an in-frame deletion, and 11 were intronic variants. Notably, the globally common variant H1069Q was not detected in this study. The mutational spectrum of <i>ATP7B</i> in the Iraqi population is diverse, despite the high rates of consanguinity. It differs from that of neighboring countries. We provided evidence for ten VUS to be reclassified as deleterious, raising questions about the diagnostic criteria for patients with higher Leipzig scores and a single deleterious variant."

    "abstract": "Mowat-Wilson Syndrome (MWS) is a rare autosomal dominant genetic disorder. Approximately half of individuals with MWS present with Hirschsprung's Disease (HSCR). There is no nested case-control study that correlates with its prognosis. This study aimed to compare the mid-to-short-term postoperative prognosis between children with MWS-associated with HSCR and those with isolated HSCR. A retrospective analysis was conducted on clinical data of HSCR patients who underwent surgery at a pediatric hospital from January 2016 to June 2023. Patients with MWS-associated HSCR were identified through confirmed mutations in the ZEB2 gene. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used for comparative analysis. Among the identified cases, 11 had MWS-associated HSCR, and 1088 had isolated HSCR, with 44 HSCR-alone patients included in the control group after PSM. The case group comprised 7 males and 4 females, with a median age of 4 years and a median age at surgery of 3.96 months (IQR, 2.04-8.52). The study found no significant difference in the incidence of postoperative Hirschsprung-associated enterocolitis (HAEC) between the two groups, although severe abdominal distension symptoms were more prevalent in the case group. However, the median period of recurrent HAEC from the first to the last occurrence in the case group was longer at 18 months (IQR, 3-30) compared to 0 months (IQR, 0-6) in the control group. Additionally, the case group exhibited a higher rate of constipation and significantly poorer bowel function compared to the control group. Other mid-to-short-term complication rates were comparable between the two groups. Children with MWS-associated HSCR face greater challenges in postoperative recovery, including a longer period of recurrent HAEC, more severe constipation, and poorer bowel function, highlighting the need for focused prevention and enhanced intestinal management in this patient population."

    "title": "The Impact of Climate Change Across the Cancer Control Continuum: Key Considerations for Oncology Nurses.",
    "abstract": "Nurses in all specialties have been called upon to take action to address global climate change, climate justice, and health. The American Nurses Association (2023) has specifically tasked nursing professional organizations to (a) educate members on climate change-related illnesses and negative impacts on treatment, (b) collaborate with grassroots organizations for environmental justice efforts, (c) support policies that promote climate mitigation and adaptation, (d) maintain familiarity with climate justice frameworks, and (e) collectively amplify the voice of nursing to strengthen its impact on climate policy. The purpose of this white paper is to enlighten members of the Oncology Nursing Society and oncology nurses at large on the increasing impact of climate change across the cancer control continuum and the pivotal role of the oncology nurse in education, research, clinical practice, and advocacy. Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperature and weather patterns that are occurring because of global warming (United Nations, n.d.). Climate change is an often-overlooked social determinant of (or contributor to) health that exacerbates poor health, increases healthcare costs, disproportionately affects some communities, and has a synergistic effect with other social determinants of health (Ragavan et al., 2020). Climate change affects all aspects of the cancer control continuum and impacts some populations disproportionately. Events such as wildfires and floods, exacerbated by climate change, can heighten individuals' exposure to cancer-causing substances, thereby increasing their susceptibility to the disease; reducing such exposure can reduce risks for cancer and positively impact the environment. Air pollution, extended droughts, heat waves, ultraviolet radiation, extreme weather events, and food supply disruptions also impact cancer etiology. Extreme weather events disrupt preventive care, cancer detection, and screening efforts, and create workforce shortages that can lead to suboptimal care. Disruptions in the supply chain and scheduled healthcare visits impact patient care continuity. Additionally, climate-related extreme weather events have an impact on overall survival and disrupt end-of-life care, underscoring the pervasive impact of climate change on cancer care across the continuum. Oncology nurses are strategically positioned to contribute to multifaceted solutions, including obtaining and offering education to fellow healthcare providers, students, patients, community members, and policymakers. Oncology nurse scientists are equipped to spearhead the generation of pertinent new knowledge, and nurses in clinical care can play a crucial role in assisting their healthcare system to become carbon net neutral. Oncology nurses must answer the call to actively engage in climate and health advocacy efforts within their own healthcare systems and in the communities where they live, work, and play. Several resources for education and action are shared."

We evaluated the genetic data of the patients and the differences between regions and hospitals. a multicentric observational study from the WD Registry after the first year was carried out. patients from 30 hospitals, in 13/17 Spanish regions (covering 80 % of population) were included. Genetic data were available for 260/320 patients. More than 130 mutations in the ATP7B gene were reported, the majority in less than four alleles, being most prevalent p.Met645Arg (20 % alleles, mainland and the Canary Islands), p.Leu708Pro (16.5 %, Canary Islands) and p.His1069Gln (8.3 %, mainland). Only 15 mutations occurred in homozygosis, three in more than five patients: p.Leu708Pro (24 patients), p.Met645Arg and p.His1069Gln (six patients each). Genetic data availability ranged from 0-100 % among regions; similarly, the difference among hospitals within a region was larger than 50 %. Without a genetic test, up to 45 % of patients would not have reached Leipzig score > 3. In screening cases, genetics was used in 45/58 (78 %); without genetics, two thirds would not have reached a Leipzig score > 3 (33/49). here we present the first genetic map of WD in Spain. The use of genetic tests was highly heterogeneous, being higher in screening cases. Although a large variability of mutations was found, regional characteristics indicated that screening for a limited number of exons (6, 8, 10, 14 or 17) would detect more than 50 % of alleles in a given region, thus enabling the design of better tailored diagnosis/screening strategies."

    "abstract": "Accurate diagnosis is essential for effective cancer treatment, particularly in peritoneal surface malignancies, where failure to detect metastatic lesions can mislead the treatment plan. This study assessed the diagnostic accuracy of staging laparoscopy using the integration of artificial intelligence (AI)-guided photodynamic diagnosis (PDD) with the photosensitizer Phonozen, activated at 405 nm in a rabbit model. To create peritoneal carcinomatosis, VX2 cells were inoculated laparoscopically into the peritoneum of female white New Zealand rabbits. Conventional and PDD-guided laparoscopy utilized a customized light source that emitted broad-spectrum white light or 405-nm blue light, respectively. The surgical procedure comprised a tripartite approach: exploration and labeling of suspected nodules under white-light visualization, identification of additional metastatic tumors under blue-excitation fluorescent light, and confirmatory open laparotomy to locate overlooked nodules by palpation. Our results showed that the initial experimental data from 371 nodules in 14 rabbits, comparing conventional diagnostic laparoscopy and PDD, showed increased detection sensitivity from 67% Â± 1.9% (conventional) to 98% Â± 0.7% (PDD) in the small-size nodule. In the second experimental data set from 265 nodules in 10 rabbits, the addition of a real-time AI algorithm further increased the sensitivity to 100% Â± 0.0%. Combining PDD with AI enhances the detection of peritoneal cancer metastasis in staging laparoscopy."

In order to study this gene and its association with these phenotypes, our lab recently created a Myt1l heterozygous mutant mouse inspired by a clinically relevant mutation. This model recapitulates several of the physical and neurologic abnormalities seen in humans with MYT1L syndrome, such as weight gain, microcephaly, and behavioral disruptions. The majority of patients with this syndrome are young, and little is known about the impact of age on health and mortality in these patients. Using a Myt1l mutant mouse, we examined the impact of Myt1l mutation on body weights, lifespan, and histopathology findings of mice at the end of life. This cohort of heterozygous mice demonstrated increased body weight across the lifespan, however there was no significant difference in lifespan, apparent cause of death, or end of life histopathological findings between Myt1l heterozygous and wildtype mice. These findings suggest while Myt1l heterozygous mutation may influence overall brain development, it does not strongly impact other organ systems in the body over time."

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) includes ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), chronic conditions characterized by gastrointestinal inflammation. We describe eight individuals with both PANS and IBD. All individuals with both IBD and PANS were identified from Stanford Immune Behavioral Health Clinic, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease Program, and Dartmouth Neuroimmune Psychiatric Disorders (NIPD) Clinic. Data were collected by chart review. Eight cases of PANS with IBD were identified. Five were male. The mean age of onset was 9.3 years for PANS and 15.6 years for IBD. PANS preceded development of IBD in 7 of 8 cases by a mean of 8.4 years. Seven patients (88%) had a first-degree relative with an immune-mediated disease, including 5 with psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis. Five patients themselves had arthralgias or arthritis (63%). All 5 cases where PANS preceded IBD treatment sufficiently for analysis were free of major behavioral relapses after IBD was managed. The triad of PANS, joint complaints, and family history of autoimmunity, including psoriasis, may represent a subset of PANS at heightened risk for IBD and additional immune-mediated disorders. For children with this triad, clinicians should have a low threshold to evaluate for gastrointestinal inflammation with biomarkers like hemoglobin, CRP, fecal calprotectin, and diagnostic endoscopy when indicated. PANS symptoms may improve with effective treatment of IBD. The high prevalence of joint complaints in our cohort and psoriasis in first-degree family members suggests this subset of PANS may share immune mechanisms with psoriasis and arthritis. Treatment strategies used in IBD and arthritis should be studied for potential application in PANS."

However, its metabolism in vivo needs to be clarified. In this study, Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry-tandem (UPLC-Q-TOF-MS<sup>E</sup>) was employed to analyze the metabolic pathways of these critical components in the rat after identifying the prototypes and metabolites of GDL in the plasma, liver, and urine of both normal and copper-loaded rats. As a result, 49 components were detected in the plasma of normally administered rats, including 29 prototype compounds and 20 metabolites; and 26 components were detected in the liver of normally administered rats, including 16 prototype compounds and 10 metabolites. 43 components were detected in the plasma of copper-laden administered rats, including 25 prototype compounds and 18 metabolites; and 23 components were detected in the liver of copper-laden administered rats, including 15 prototype compounds and 8 metabolites. A total of 73 GDL-related substances were detected in the urine of rats. The study results showed that the compositions in rats' plasma, liver, and urine were similar, mainly alkaloids and anthraquinones. The alkaloid components are mainly metabolized by phase I metabolism in vivo and the metabolic pathways are methylation, demethylation, etc. The anthraquinone components are mainly metabolized by phase II metabolism in vivo, and the metabolism modes are mainly glucuronidation and sulfation. The present study comprehensively analyses the metabolic properties of GDL and sets an essential basis for further investigations on the pharmacokinetics, in vivo bioactive components, and mechanism of action of GDL."

The sense of smell is today one of the focuses of interest in aging and neurodegenerative diseases research. However, in WD olfactory function (OF) is still poorly investigated. Our aim was to perform a systematic review of the studies evaluating OF in WD. We searched PubMed for original papers evaluating olfactory function in WD and retrieved five articles. Additionally, one article was identified while viewing the references lists of the included studies. Finally, we included 6 studies. The number of patients ranged from 12 to 68 (altogether 222 WD patients) and their clinical characteristics were variable. Differences in methodology (mainly various tests used for OF evaluation) made it impossible to meta-analyze the data. OF was worse in WD than in controls in all studies. In 3 studies OF was impaired significantly in neurologic phenotype vs hepatic, which was not confirmed in 2 other studies. Correlation between OF and presence of brain lesions in magnetic resonance imaging was inconsistent across two studies. Only one study assessed brain regions involved in the olfactory tract by evaluating olfactory bulb volume. There was no effect of WD treatment, including its type and duration on OF (4 studies). One study additionally assessed taste which was preserved in WD. Although OF was found to be abnormal in WD, this area remains insufficiently explored. Further studies conducted on larger cohorts, with a focus on olfactory tract damage, is essential."

This post-hoc study will firstly aim to establish the correlation existing between the currently preferred gold standard liver biopsy and 2D-Shear Wave elastography's diagnostic accuracy in paediatric patients presenting with suspected or confirmed liver disease. This retrospective study was conducted in Pakistan Kidney and Liver Institute and Research Center in Lahore, Pakistan from August 2017 to January 2024. In this analysis, 37 Paediatric patients with various liver diseases who underwent liver biopsy for autoimmune hepatitis, Budd-Chiari syndrome, Wilson disease and other liver-related pathologies were included. Thirty-seven patients with a mean age of 10 years (ranging from 4-14 years) were enrolled. According to this study, sixteen out of thirty seven (43%) cases of chronic liver disease were caused by autoimmune hepatitis. Patients' average liver stiffness as determined by SWE was 12.14 Â± 0.75 kPa. According to elastography, the average liver stiffness in individuals with F0-F1 fibrosis was 6 Â± 0.01 kPa, 7.67 Â± 0.29 in stage F2, 8.62 Â± 0.20 in stage F3, and 14.05 Â± 3.69 kPa in stage F4. We discovered that the mean level of hepatic stiffness varied significantly depending on the degree of fibrosis (p = 0.0001). SWE gauges the liver tissue's stiffness, which rises with fibrosis severity. Research has demonstrated that SWE, which is frequently equivalent to liver biopsy, has a high degree of accuracy in identifying and staging hepatic fibrosis."

Although the first CXCR4 drug plerixafor emerged over a decade ago (2007), recently the first peptide (motixafortide, 2023) and the first oral small molecule (mavorixafor, 2024) CXCR4 antagonists became FDA approved. This article describes patent documents published during the period of 2019 through 2024 for both small molecule and peptides. This IP includes few new chemotypes, with most being extensions of existing structural classes. There is also less significant IP covering peptide-based therapeutics than those covering small molecules. Notably, multiple therapeutic uses have also emerged. Patents were searched from SciFinder (CAS) and Google Patents with the term <i>CXCR4 antagonists</i>. Patents were selected according to whether they fit into the classification of small molecules or peptides. In the last 5 years there has been significant advancement in CXCR4 antagonists as gauged by the FDA approval of two drugs.

    "abstract": "Wilson disease is a rare monogenic disease characterized by copper overload in various organs, mainly the liver, the brain and the eyes. It has a prevalence ranging between 1/30,000 and 1/50,000, and it is caused by pathogenic variants in the ATP7B gene, which encodes a copper-transporting ATPase essential for regulating liver copper levels by directing copper to the secretory pathway and exporting excess copper into bile. It is a fatal disease if left untreated; however early diagnosis and effective treatment enable patient's outcome improvement. Unfortunately, in the Arab world there is no collective data on Wilson disease. This systematic review presents an explicit overview on the clinical and molecular spectrum of Wilson disease in the Arab world. A literature search was conducted on five databases from their inception until April 2024, using a combination of words related to the genetics of Wilson disease in the Arab world. The search resulted in 48 relevant studies carried out in 13 Arab countries, in which 802 Wilson disease patients were reported, with a high rate of consanguinity, and a slight male predominance. Hepatic presentations were the most frequent features in patients, and a total of 92 variants were identified with a detection rate of 61.2%. Genotype-phenotype correlations were not established for the majority of variants. This review revealed a clinical and molecular heterogeneity of Wilson disease in the Arab world. Efforts from health authorities, clinicians and geneticists are recommended to improve diagnosis, reduce disease incidence and give more insights into the present-day understanding of Wilson disease in the Arab world."

    "abstract": "Copper (Cu) is a vitally important micronutrient, whose balance between essential and toxic levels requires a tightly regulated network of proteins. Dysfunction in key components of this network leads to the disruption of Cu homeostasis, resulting in fatal disorders such as Wilson disease, which is caused by mutations in the hepatic Cu efflux transporter ATP7B. Unfortunately, the molecular targets for normalizing Cu homeostasis in Wilson disease remain poorly understood. Here, using genome-wide screening, we identified the cellular prion protein (PrP) as an important mediator of Cu toxicity in WD. Loss of ATP7B stimulates hepatic expression of PrP, which promotes endocytic Cu uptake, leading to toxic Cu overload. Suppression of PrP significantly reduces Cu toxicity in cell and animal models of Wilson disease. These findings highlight the critical regulatory role of PrP in copper metabolism and open new avenues for exploring the therapeutic potential of PrP suppression in Wilson disease."

    "abstract": "Inositol phosphates (IPs) and inositol pyrophosphate play critical roles in many biological processes such as signaling molecules in pathways responsible for cellular functions involved in growth and maintenance. The biosynthesis of IPs is carried out by a family of inositol phosphate kinases. In mammals, Inositol tetrakisphosphate kinase-1 (ITPK1) phosphorylates inositol-1,3,4-trisphosphate (Ins(1,3,4)P<sub>3</sub>) and inositol-3,4,5,6-tetrakisphosphate (IP<sub>4</sub>), generating inositol-1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate (IP<sub>5</sub>), which can be further phosphorylated to become inositol hexakisphosphate (IP<sub>6</sub>). ITPK1 also possesses phosphatase activity that can convert IP<sub>5</sub> back to IP<sub>4</sub>; therefore, ITPK1 may serve as a regulatory step in IP<sub>6</sub> production. IP<sub>6</sub> utilization has been implicated in processes fundamental to cellular sustainability that are severely perturbed in many disease states including RNA editing, DNA repair, chromatin structure organization, and ubiquitin ligation. Therefore, ITPK1, with no known inhibitors in the literature, is a potential molecular target for modulating important processes in several human diseases. By independently coupling ITPK1 phosphatase and kinase activities to luciferase activity, we have developed and used biochemical high-throughput assays to discover eight ITPK1 inhibitors. Further analysis revealed that three of these leads inhibit ITPK1 in an ATP-competitive manner, with low micromolar to nanomolar affinities. We further demonstrate that the most potent ITPK1 inhibitor can regulate cellular ITPK1 activity. We determined the crystal structure of ITPK1 in complex with this inhibitor at a resolution of 2.25 Ã. This work provides insight into the design of potential next-generation inhibitors."

    "abstract": "Coronary artery disease is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Coronary artery disease can lead to major complications including myocardial infarction (MI). The association of dietary cholesterol with coronary artery disease remains inconsistent. We examined the relation of dietary cholesterol with the incidence of MI among participants of the Million Veteran Program. The Million Veteran Program is a prospective cohort database collecting genetic and nongenetic factors influencing chronic diseases. We analyzed data from 180 156 veterans with complete information on relevant dietary intake. The association between dietary cholesterol and MI risk was assessed using both linear and nonlinear models. Statistical significance was determined using the Wald test for linear trends and the likelihood ratio test for nonlinearity, alongside comparisons between high (â¥300 mg/d) and low (<300 mg/d) cholesterol intake groups. In this study of 180 156 veterans with mean follow-up of 3.5 years, we observed a linear, dose-response association between dietary cholesterol intake and risk of MI, with every 100-mg/d increment in cholesterol intake associated with a 5% higher MI risk (relative risk [RR], 1.05 [95% CI, 1.02-1.08]). Subjects consuming >300 mg/d of cholesterol had a 15% increased MI risk compared with those consuming less (RR, 1.15 [95% CI, 1.06-1.25]). We found that dietary cholesterol intake was linearly associated with greater risk of MI. These findings contribute to the growing literature highlighting the impact dietary cholesterol has on cardiovascular health. Reductions in cholesterol intake, which can be achieved by decreasing the intake of meat and eggs, may reduce the risk of incident MI."

Single instrumental case study. Data collection occurred between March and August 2023, and included interviews with parents, historical case files, descriptions of the nurse-led model of care and a list of the daily registered nurse-led interventions. The evidence presented strongly support the positive impact a nurse-led model of care can have for persons with profound disability and complex health conditions, and their families. The improved quality of life observed in this project underscores the significant role nurses play in enhancing the well-being of this vulnerable population. Further research on a larger scale should be completed to create a robust foundation of a specialised, nurse-led model of care for individuals with profound disability and complex health conditions. There is room for funded intermediate models of care as the health system cannot be expected, and nor is it appropriate, to provide ongoing care for all people with intellectual disability.

Leveraging association effect sizes across multiple traits in WGS rare variant association analysis can improve statistical power over single-trait analysis, and also detect pleiotropic genes and regions. Existing multi-trait methods have limited ability to perform rare variant analysis of large-scale WGS data. We propose MultiSTAAR, a statistical framework and computationally scalable analytical pipeline for functionally informed multi-trait rare variant analysis in large-scale WGS studies. MultiSTAAR accounts for relatedness, population structure and correlation among phenotypes by jointly analyzing multiple traits, and further empowers rare variant association analysis by incorporating multiple functional annotations. We applied MultiSTAAR to jointly analyze three lipid traits in 61,838 multi-ethnic samples from the Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) Program. We discovered and replicated new associations with lipid traits missed by single-trait analysis."

Steatotic grafts have inferior outcomes post-transplantation, due to increased sensitivity to ischaemia-reperfusion injury. We aimed to formally evaluate the impact of visually assessed liver steatosis in grafts donated following brainstem (DBD) versus circulatory death (DCD). NHS registry on adult liver transplantation was reviewed retrospectively (2006-2019). We used multiple-imputation for missing data and adjusted regression models with interaction terms to compare the impact of visually assessed donor graft steatosis on transplant outcome. 9217 recipients of deceased donor grafts were included (DBD = 7349; DCD = 1868). Multivariable cox regression revealed that the negative impact on graft survival was significantly different in DCD and DBD livers (interaction P = 0.011 and P = 0.043). The largest impact was in DCD livers (moderate steatosis: aHR = 1.851, 1.296-2.645, P = 0.001 and aHR = 5.426; severe steatosis: 1.723-17.090, P = 0.004). Visually assessed steatosis did not predict longer-term graft survival in the DBD cohort. The impact of visually assessed steatosis on post-transplant outcome is far greater in DCD grafts, despite an identical method of steatosis assessment. This highlights novel therapeutics should be considered for steatotic DCD grafts to allow this growing sector of the donor pool to be safely utilised."

    "abstract": "For many RNA viruses, immunity is triggered when RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) detect viral RNA. However, only a minority of infected cells undergo innate immune activation. By examining these \"first-responder\" cells during West Nile virus infection, we found that specific accumulation of antigenomic negative-sense viral RNA (-vRNA) underlies innate immune activation and that RIG-I preferentially interacts with -vRNA. However, flaviviruses sequester -vRNA into membrane-bound replication compartments away from cytosolic sensors. We found that single-stranded -vRNA accumulates outside of replication compartments in first-responder cells, rendering it accessible to RLRs. Exposure of this -vRNA occurs at late time points of infection, is linked to viral assembly, and depends on the expression of viral structural proteins. These findings reveal that, although most infected cells replicate high levels of vRNA, release of -vRNA from replication compartments during assembly occurs at low frequency and is critical for initiation of innate immunity during flavivirus infection."

    "abstract": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of death globally. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a common comorbidity in COPD associated with worse pulmonary symptoms, reduced quality of life, and increased exacerbations and hospitalizations. GERD treatment in COPD is associated with a lower risk of exacerbations and mortality; however, it is not clear whether these findings can be attributed to aging populations where both diseases are likely to co-occur or reflect shared etiology. To test for the influence of common etiology in both diseases, we aimed to identify shared genetic etiology between GERD and COPD. We performed the first whole-genome sequence association analysis of comorbid GERD and COPD in 12,438 multi-ancestry participants. The co-heritability of GERD and COPD was 39.7% (h2 = 0.397, SE = 0.074) and we identified several ancestry-independent loci associated with co-morbid GERD and COPD (within LINC02493 and FRYL) known to be involved in oxidative stress and G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling mechanisms. We found several loci associated with co-morbid GERD and COPD previously associated with GERD or COPD individually, including HCG17, which plays a role in oxidative stress mechanisms. Gene set enrichment identified GPCR signaling pathways in co-morbid GERD and COPD loci. Rare variants in ZFP42, encoding key regulators of the IL6/STAT3 pathway, have been previously implicated with GI disorders and were associated with co-morbid GERD and COPD. We identified common genetic etiology for GERD in COPD which begins to provide a mechanistic foundation for the potential therapeutic utility of STAT3, oxidation, and GPCR signaling pathway modulators in both GERD and COPD."

    "abstract": "Socioeconomic deprivation has been linked to negative child developmental outcomes including brain development, psychological well-being, educational attainment, and social-emotional well-being. Maternal mental health has also been linked to mothers' parenting practices and their children's developmental outcomes. However, limited evidence exists regarding the role of maternal mental health (prenatal and postnatal) in the association between socioeconomic deprivation and children's developmental outcomes. We examined the potential role of maternal mental health in the association between socioeconomic deprivation (SED) and child development outcomes. We used a large linked administrative health dataset covering children born between 2011 and 2015 in Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Scotland. Of the 76,483 participants, 55,856 mothers with matched children's developmental outcome data were included. A mediation analysis model, adjusted for confounders and covariates, was used. Maternal mental health assessed by a history of hospital admissions mediated, but to a small extent, the relationship between SED and children's developmental outcomes. The average direct effect (ADE), of SED in the first model with a history of hospital admissions, was ADE: ES = - 0.0875 (95% CI = - 0.097, - 0.08; p < 0.001) and ACME: ES = - 0.0002 (95% CI = - 0.001, - 0.0001; p = 0.01). The proportion mediated by the history of mental health admission was 0.3%. The association between SED and children's developmental outcomes appears to be partially mediated by maternal mental health, although the proportional-mediated effect was very small."

Patients with ARIs were identified weekly by electronic surveillance for 1 or more of 130 <i>ICD-10</i> codes that defined ARI. Patients were followed for 30 days for the primary outcomes of hospitalization and mortality. Testing for RSV with nasopharyngeal swabbing followed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was done as part of usual care. Risk of 30-day mortality and RSV positivity was tested in a generalized estimating equation. From 1 210 394 patients with ARI, 345 185 (28.5%) adults underwent RSV testing, which was positive in 2.4%. In adults who were RSV+, the overall mortality rate was 1.9% as compared with 2.9% in adults who were RSV-. Mortality with RSV+ status increased with age â¥65 years to 3.8% (95% CI, 3.1%-4.5%).

    "abstract": "Although the motor symptoms of Wilson's disease have received particular attention from researchers and medical professionals, non-motor symptoms might become increasingly prevalent with the advancement of the disease and can even appear before the onset of motor symptoms. However, clinicopathological correlations for most of these non-motor features are still poorly understood. The correlations between non-motor and motor symptoms have been examined in this study. Fifty patients with Wilson's disease participated in this study. Each subject was administered the Global Assessment Scale and the Non-Motor Symptom Questionnaire (NMS Quest) for the assessment of motor and non-motor symptoms, respectively. Cognitive functions were evaluated with Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination III (Bengali version) and the Digit Span Test. Sleep-related problems were assessed with Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Of the patients who participated in this study, 82%, 56%, 90%, 18%, 82%, 8%, 60%, 56%, and 66% had digestive, urinary, apathy-attention-memory, hallucinations/delusions, depression/anxiety, sexual function, cardiovascular, sleep disorder, and miscellaneous (pain, weight, swelling, sweating, and diplopia) symptoms, respectively.

The present study aimed to compare long-term outcomes of two guidelines-recommended ablative techniques, cryotherapy (CRYO) and radiofrequency ablation (RFA). Data of patients with single cT1 solid renal mass undergoing CRYO or RFA between 2004 and 2020 were retrospectively retrieved from a multi-institutional international database. Oncologic outcomes included \"technical success\", local recurrence-free survival (RFS), distant metastasis-free survival (MFS), and overall survival (OS). Intraoperative and postoperative complications, length of stay (LOS), and re-admission rate within 30 days were registered. Major complications were defined as CD grade â¥III. Baseline features and treatment outcomes were analyzed using descriptive statistics. RFS, MFS, and OS were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Overall, 643 patients were included, of which 492 (71.2%) underwent CRYO, and 151 (21.8%) RFA, with a median follow-up of 43 and 37 months, respectively (p=0.07). Technical success was achieved in 96.5% of CRYO vs 93.4% of RFA (p=0.09). No difference in terms of overall (CRYO: 10.4% vs RFA: 6%; p=0.1) and \"major\" (CRYO: 0.8% vs RFA: 1.3; p=0.06) post-operative complications were observed. RFS (CRYO:85.7%; RFA:84.9%, p=0.2), MFS (CRYO: 96.9%; RFA: 95.8%, p=0.4) and OS (CRYO: 89%; RFA: 87.4%; p=0.8) were comparable. CRYO and RFA are both valid minimally invasive options for the treatment of small renal tumors. They are particularly suitable for patients who are not good surgical candidates as they offer very low risk of major procedure-related complications. For the right indication, they both offer favorable mid to long term oncologic outcomes."

    "abstract": "Immersing the brain in a solution containing formaldehyde is a commonly used method for preserving the structure of human brain tissue in brain banking. However, there are questions about the quality of preservation using this method, as formaldehyde takes a relatively long period of time to penetrate a large organ such as the human brain. As a result, there is a critical need to determine whether immersion fixation is an adequate initial preservation method. To address this, we present exploratory histologic findings from our brain bank following the immersion fixation of hemi-sectioned brain specimens under refrigeration. Using light microscopy, we found that there was no significant change in the size of pericellular or perivascular rarefaction areas based on the postmortem interval (PMI) or on the progression from the outer (frontal cortex) to the inner (striatum) brain regions. Additionally, we did not identify any significant number of ghost cells - a state of late-stage cellular necrosis - in the light micrographs analyzed. Using transmission electron microscopy of tissue from the frontal cortex, we found that synapses could still be visualized, but there was vacuolization and variable degrees of myelin disbanding identified. Using serial section transmission electron microscopy, we found that identified synapses could be traced from one section to the next. Using serial block face scanning electron microscopy, we also found that myelinated axons on 2D images can be traced with high fidelity from one image to the next, even at PMIs of up to 27 hours. Collectively, our data corroborate previous findings that immersion fixation is effective for prevention of cellular necrosis and for visualizing many ultrastructural features in at least the surface areas of the brain. However, how structural preservation quality should best be assessed in brain banking is an open question that depends on the intended research applications."

The introduction of high-fructose corn syrup to the diet in the 1970s has been linked to metabolic and hepatic disturbances. Despite these associations, the potential for sex-dependent responses resulting from fructose-containing diets on MASLD/MASH has not been addressed. Female and male C57BL/6J mice were fed a fructose-palmitate-cholesterol (FPC)-NASH diet <i>vs.</i> standard chow for 16 weeks (n = 40 mice). At sacrifice, plasma and liver were retrieved, the latter for single-nucleus RNA sequencing. Publicly available data sets of human male and female MASH liver were probed. The FPC-NASH diet-induced metabolic dysfunction in both female and male mice, with females exhibiting more severe hepatic steatosis (<i>p =</i> 0.0262), inflammation (<i>p =</i> 0.0206), and fibrosis (<i>p <</i>0.0001). Single-nucleus RNA sequencing revealed distinct sex-specific transcriptional profiles in hepatocytes and stellate cells responding to the FPC-NASH diet compared to the standard chow. In female mice, compared to males, pathways associated with lipid and metabolic processes in hepatocytes and cell-cell communication and adhesion in stellate cells were enriched. Metabolic flux analyses demonstrated reduced bile acid metabolism in female mice and human hepatocytes in FPC-NASH and MASH conditions, respectively, compared to their male counterparts. Molecular profiling of hepatocytes and stellate cells in FPC-NASH diet-fed mice revealed significant sex differences mirrored in human MASH. The identification of intrinsic, within-sex, diet-dependent disparities underscores the critical need to include both male and female individuals in MAFLD/MASH studies and clinical trials. Despite the importance of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) in impairment of human health, the potential for and mechanisms of sex-dependent responses have yet to be well-studied, particularly with respect to the possible influence of high-fructose corn syrup additives to the diet, which has been linked to metabolic and hepatic disturbances. In a mouse model of fructose supplementation to a NASH diet, female mice displayed significantly higher MASH scores (steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis) compared to male mice. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing of livers revealed intrinsic, diet-dependent molecular disparities within sex, which were exaggerated when comparing female <i>vs.</i> male mice fed the fructose-containing NASH diet; many of these findings were recapitulated in human female <i>vs.</i> male patients with MASH. These results highlight potential mechanistic explanations and therapeutic targets for addressing sex differences and underscore the need to study both sexes in animal models and human MASH."

Here we show that new variants of adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) displaying robust and widespread transduction in the kidneys of mice, pigs and non-human-primates can be obtained by evolving capsid libraries via cross-species cycling in different kidney models. Specifically, the new variants, AAV.k13 and AAV.k20, were enriched from the libraries following sequential intravenous cycling through mouse and pig kidneys, ex vivo cycling in human organoid cultures, and ex vivo machine perfusion in isolated kidneys from rhesus macaques. The two variants transduced murine kidneys following intravenous administration, with selective tropism for proximal tubules, and led to markedly higher transgene expression than parental AAV9 vectors in proximal tubule epithelial cells within human organoid cultures and in autotransplanted pig kidneys. Following ureteral delivery, AAV.k20 efficiently transduced kidneys in pigs and macaques. The AAV.k13 and AAV.k20 variants are promising vectors for therapeutic gene-transfer applications in kidney diseases and transplantation."

    "title": "Prediction of obstructive coronary artery disease using coronary calcification and epicardial adipose tissue assessments from CT calcium scoring scans.",
    "abstract": "Low-cost/no-cost non-contrast CT calcium scoring (CTCS) exams can provide direct evidence of coronary atherosclerosis. In this study, using features from CTCS images, we developed a novel machine learning model to predict obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD), as defined by the coronary artery disease-reporting and data system (CAD-RADS). This study analyzed 1324 patients from the SCOT-HEART trial who underwent both CTCS and CT angiography. Obstructive CAD was defined as CAD-RADS 4A-5, while CAD-RADS 0-3 were considered non-obstructive CAD. We analyzed clinical, Agatston-score-derived, and epicardial fat-omics features to predict obstructive CAD. The most predictive features were selected using elastic net logistic regression and used to train a CatBoost model. Model performance was evaluated using 1000 repeated five-fold cross-validation and survival analyses to predict major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) and revascularization. Generalizability was assessed using an external validation set of 2316 patients for survival predictions. Among the 1324 patients, obstructive CAD was identified in 334 patients (25.2 â%). Elastic net regression identified the top 14 features (5 clinical, 2 Agatston-score-derived, and 7 fat-omics). The proposed method achieved excellent performance for classifying obstructive CAD, with an AUC of 90.1 âÂ± â0.9 â% and sensitivity/specificity/accuracy of 83.5 âÂ± â5.5 â%/93.7 âÂ± â1.9 â%/82.4 âÂ± â2.0 â%. The inclusion of Agatston-score-derived and fat-omics features significantly improved classification performance. Survival analyses showed that both actual and predicted obstructive CAD significantly differentiated patients who experienced MACE and revascularization. We developed a novel machine learning model to predict obstructive CAD from non-contrast CTCS scans. Our findings highlight the potential clinical benefits of CTCS imaging in identifying patients likely to benefit from advanced imaging."

    "title": "The effectiveness and risks of Treating people with Idiopathic Pulmonary fibrosis with the Addition of Lansoprazole (TIPAL): study protocol for a randomised placebo-controlled multicentre clinical trial.",
    "abstract": "Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic progressive fibrotic lung disease frequently complicated by gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. Although several observational studies and a pilot study have investigated the role of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) in IPF, their efficacy is unknown and there is much debate in international IPF guidelines on their use. We aim to undertake an adequately powered double-blind placebo-controlled randomised multicentre clinical trial to assess the change in forced vital capacity (FVC), cough and other important patient-reported outcomes, following 12-month therapy with PPIs in people with IPF. A total of 298 patients with IPF diagnosed by a multidisciplinary team according to international guidelines who are not receiving PPIs will be enrolled. Patients are randomised equally to receive two capsules of lansoprazole or two placebo capsules, two times per day for 12 months. The primary outcome for the trial is change in FVC, measured at home, between the first week and last week of the study period. Secondary assessments include cough frequency (in a subgroup) measured using the VitaloJAK cough monitor, the King's Brief Interstitial Lung Disease questionnaire, the Raghu Scale for Pulmonary Fibrosis, Medical Research Council dyspnoea score, EQ-5D-5L, Leicester Cough Questionnaire, modified DeMeester reflux symptoms questionnaire and opportunistically captured routine lung function measurements. High-resolution CT scoring will be undertaken in a subgroup. The trial is designed to determine whether treating people with IPF with lansoprazole will reduce the reduction in FVC over a year. The COVID-19 pandemic required the study to be undertaken as a remote trial. This study received ethical approval from the East of England Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Research Ethics Committee (reference 20/EE/0043; integrated research application system number 269050). Trial results will be published in a peer-reviewed journal upon completion. ISRCTN13526307; ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04965298."

    "abstract": "Analysis of isotope distributions plays a crucial role in medical diagnostics. While radioactive and radiogenic isotopes - those that undergo or result from radioactive decay - are widely used, stable isotopes are less commonly applied despite their significant diagnostic potential. For example, calcium isotope ratio analysis is already commercially utilized for calcium loss and the early diagnosis of osteoporosis. Additionally, analyses of iron, copper, and zinc isotope ratios have been explored in various conditions, including hemochromatosis, Wilson's disease, cancer, Alzheimer's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Altered isotope ratios in these diseases are thought to reflect pathophysiologically relevant processes, making them promising biomarkers. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current and potential applications of stable isotope analysis in medicine."

    "abstract": "Fetal development in an adverse in utero environment significantly increases the risk of developing metabolic diseases in later life, including dyslipidemia, nonalcoholic fatty liver diseases, and diabetes. The aim of this study was to determine whether improving the in utero fetal growth environment with a placental nanoparticle gene therapy would ameliorate fetal growth restriction (FGR)-associated dysregulation of fetal hepatic lipid and glucose metabolism-related signaling pathways. Using the guinea pig maternal nutrient restriction (MNR) model of placental insufficiency and FGR, placenta efficiency and fetal weight were significantly improved following three administrations of a nonviral polymer-based nanoparticle gene therapy to the placenta from mid-pregnancy (<i>gestational day 35</i>) until <i>gestational day 52</i>. The nanoparticle gene therapy transiently increased expression of human insulin-like growth factor 1 (<i>hIGF1</i>) in placenta trophoblast. Fetal liver tissue was collected near-term at <i>gestational day 60</i>. Fetal sex-specific differences in liver gene and protein expression of profibrosis and glucose metabolism-related factors were demonstrated in sham-treated FGR fetuses but not observed in FGR fetuses who received placental <i>hIGF1</i> nanoparticle treatment. Increased plasma bilirubin, an indirect measure of hepatic activity, was also demonstrated with placental <i>hIGF1</i> nanoparticle treatment. We speculate that the changes in liver gene and protein expression and increased liver activity that result in similar expression profiles to appropriately growing control fetuses might confer protection against increased susceptibility to aberrant liver physiology in later life. Overall, this work opens avenues for future research assessing the translational prospect of mitigating FGR-induced metabolic derangements.<b>NEW & NOTEWORTHY</b> A placenta-specific nonviral polymer-based nanoparticle gene therapy that improves placenta nutrient transport and near-term fetal weight ameliorates growth restriction-associated changes to fetal liver activity, and cholesterol and glucose/nutrient homeostasis genes/proteins that might confer protection against increased susceptibility to aberrant liver physiology in later life. This knowledge may have implications toward removing predispositions that increase the risk of metabolic diseases, including diabetes, dyslipidemia, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in later life."

A systematic literature review of studies reporting on the efficacy and effectiveness of agalsidase beta in FD was conducted. Studies were identified in searches of MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from January 2000-June 2022. Outcomes of interest included cardiac structure and mass, cardiac events, and cerebrovascular events. Fifty-two citations (41 studies) were included. Reductions in interventricular septal thickness (IVST) and/or left ventricular posterior wall thickness (LVPWT) were demonstrated in six studies (follow-up 1-6 years, <i>n</i> = 4 using echocardiography, <i>n</i> = 2 cardiac MRI). IVST ranged from 12.1-14.9 mm at baseline and 10.8-14.1 mm at follow-up (all <i>p</i> < 0.05). LVPWT ranged from 11.7-16.0 mm at baseline and 10.7-13.0 mm at follow-up (all <i>p</i> < 0.05).

Rates of composite cardiac events (3.8%-24.0%; four studies, follow-up 2-10 years) and cerebrovascular events (0.0%-18.9%; 12 studies, follow-up 1-10 years) were numerically lower than rates for placebo (follow-up 3 years). Literature over the last 20 years indicates that agalsidase beta treatment may lead to stabilization or regression of cardiac structural thickness and mass, and reduction in cardiac and cerebrovascular events relative to placebo."

    "abstract": "Developing micro-/nanomotors that convert a chemical energy input into a local gradient field and motion is an appealing but challenging task that holds particular promise for the intersection of materials and nanoengineering. Over the past two decades, remarkable advancements have refined these out-of-equilibrium chemically powered micro-/nanomotors, enabling them to orchestrate in situ chemical transformations that dynamically change local environments. The ionic products, radicals, gases, and electric fields from these active materials reshape the microenvironment, paving the way for ecofriendly disease interventions. This review discusses the state-of-the-art reactions that propel these energy-consuming micro-/nanomotors and elucidates the emerging implications of their products on biological systems. Particular emphasis has been placed on their potential for neural modulation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) regulation, synergistic tumor therapy, antibacterial strategies, and tissue regeneration. Collectively, these sketches provide a landscape of therapeutic modalities, heralding a new era of biomedicine. By harnessing the in situ product field of this active matter, we envision a paradigm shift toward active therapies that transcend conventional approaches, promising breakthroughs in disease diagnosis, treatment, and prevention."

We evaluated the association between cirrhosis and surgical outcomes in female patients with breast cancer. We performed a retrospective population-based cohort study of female patients undergoing surgery for breast cancer between 2007 and 2018 using health administrative data from Ontario, Canada. Patients were stratified by cirrhosis status. Overall survival (OS) was described using the Kaplan-Meier method and the association between cirrhosis and long-term cancer-specific mortality (CSM) was evaluated using adjusted competing risks regression and subdistribution hazard ratios (sHR). A total of 902 patients with breast cancer and cirrhosis were compared to 81,514 patients with breast cancer without cirrhosis. The median age at diagnosis was 65 years vs 61 years in patients with and without cirrhosis, respectively (p < .001). The most common etiologies of cirrhosis were metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (n = 595, 66%) and alcohol-associated (n = 143, 16%) liver disease. The median model for end-stage liver disease sodium score was 8 (IQR 6-11, n = 215). Furthermore, cirrhosis was associated with a twofold higher 90-day rate of post-operative mortality (RR 2.82; 95% CI 1.49-5.33). OS was lower in patients with cirrhosis (HR 1.41, 95% CI 1.26-1.58); however, there was no association with CSM (sHR 1.11, 95% CI 0.93-1.32). This large population-based study demonstrates that patients with cirrhosis have lower OS compared to those without cirrhosis; however, there is no difference in CSM. Their outcomes remain favorable, and they should be considered for curative-intent therapies."

    "abstract": "In this study of minoritized patients referred to modality education before dialysis, a high proportion selected, but fewer initiated dialysis with, peritoneal dialysis (PD). Those who initiated with PD were younger, healthier, and more responsive to education staff than those who started with hemodialysis. Patients identified lack of emotional support and information about overcoming structural barriers to PD as shortfalls in the education program. In a cohort of patients with late-stage kidney disease who completed dialysis modality education and who self-identified as racial ethnic minorities, we studied characteristics of those choosing peritoneal dialysis (PD) and perception of usefulness of the education session in modality selection. In this study of individuals with kidney failure cared for by nephrologists at Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, New York, who were referred for modality education, we (<i>1</i>) tested the association of patient characteristics with modality selection in 113 patients from 2021 to 2023 and (<i>2</i>) examined patient perception of the quality of modality education from 13 semistructured interviews. We compared sociodemographic, clinical attributes, and patient responsiveness to attempts made by staff among those who selected and initiated PD with those who (<i>1</i>) did not select PD or (<i>2</i>) initiated on hemodialysis urgently. We performed qualitative analysis of interviews to reach consensus on theoretical domain framework concepts and how they fit events in the kidney failure trajectory. Compared with individuals who required urgent hemodialysis, those who selected and were initiated on PD were younger (54 versus 66 years), had fewer comorbidities, and did not require as many attempts to schedule modality education. Qualitative analysis of interviews showed that experience with staff and quality of information conveyed during education was generally positive, but the following gaps were identified: lack of support for the emotional trauma of kidney failure diagnosis, inability to address structural barriers to PD specific to the patient population, and the lack of a deliberate program to lessen anxiety about the responsibility of PD. Incorporation of tailored content that addresses clinical comorbidity, structural barriers to care, and emotional trauma constitute aspects of modality education that can be improved to increase PD uptake among minoritized patients."

    "abstract": "To introduce the UChicago PBI Imaging score, a novel characterization of imaging features using head computed tomography (HCT) in patients with gunshot wounds to the head (GSWH) resulting in penetrating brain injury (PBI) and to quantify the association with mortality. We retrospectively collected and analyzed data from 230 patients with GSWH admitted to our Level 1 trauma center between May 1, 2018, and October 31, 2023. HCT images obtained on hospital arrival were evaluated for predefined imaging features by two blinded readers and arbitrated, when needed, by a third. The average contribution of each radiological feature to mortality at hospital discharge was assessed using a SuperLearner ensemble model trained on â¼77% of the cohort. Each feature's contribution was scaled to ensure the additive final score per patient ranged between 0 and 100. The HCT features predicting in-hospital mortality, ranked from highest to lowest importance, were transhemispheric projectile below the level of the third ventricle (18 [16.8, 19.9]), presence of blood in the lateral ventricles (ventricles casted) (18[16.8, 19.6]), brainstem involvement (14 [12.7, 15.1]), transhemispheric projectile above the level of the third ventricle (11 [9.7, 11.6]), presence of any amount of blood in the ambient cistern (9[8.2, 10]), presence of any amount of blood in the lateral ventricles (9 [7.9, 9.8]), cerebellar involvement (9 [7.9, 9.5]), any evidence of ventricular effacement (4 [3.4, 4.6]), midline shift (MLS) >0 mm (4 [3.4, 4.4]), perforating injury (3 [2.4, 3.2]), and presence of an intracerebral hematoma (ICH) >20 mm in the largest diameter (2 [1.4, 1.9]). The UChicago PBI Imaging score showed a strong performance, achieving an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.86 (95% CI: [0.77, 0.96]) on a test set of 56 patients who were not included in model training. This indicates better prediction accuracy compared to both the Rotterdam score (AUC 0.8, 95% CI: [0.68, 0.96]) and the Marshall score (AUC 0.66, 95% CI: [0.52, 0.81]). Our model performed particularly well for patients with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score between 5 and 9. In this range, our model's performance (AUC 0.86) remained stable, while the Rotterdam and Marshall Scores showed notably lower predictive accuracy, with AUCs of 0.61 and 0.52, respectively. A dedicated evaluation of GSWH HCT reveals an association between disease burden, as quantified by unique features not native to blunt TBI imaging models, and mortality. Specifically, transhemispheric injury below the level of the third ventricle along with blood-casting bilateral ventricles and brainstem involvement was highly associated with mortality. The model is optimized for intermediate GCS scores where greater prognostic uncertainty exists. This study parallels efforts to refine TBI classification, underscoring the necessity for precise imaging-based classification in PBI to identify imaging biomarkers and ultimately enhance prognostication and targeted treatment."

These differences have not been examined within the context of age-related brain changes during childhood to early adulthood. To evaluate differences in age-related neurodevelopmental changes in patients with CKD compared with control participants and to investigate associations between regional neuroanatomy, functional outcomes, and disease-related variables. Case-control study of individuals aged 6 through 21 years with and without CKD at an academic medical center in Iowa City, Iowa, from September 2016 to August 2024. Neurocognitive testing; 3-T magnetic resonance imaging. Participants completed standardized neurocognitive assessments and quantitative neuroanatomical scans. Brain regions of interest (ROIs) were analyzed for volumetric differences using automated pipelines. Multivariable linear models assessed neurocognitive and neuroanatomical differences between groups, including an age Ã group interaction for ROI analyses. The sample included 124 individuals (mean [SD] age, 12.8 [4.5] years; 74 [59.7%] male), including 87 control participants (44 [50.6%] male) and 37 participants with CKD (30 [81.1%] male). The mean (SD) eGFR was 71.3 [25.5] mL/min/1.73 m2 for the CKD group. Participants with CKD scored lower than control participants on most neurocognitive measures included in the analyses. The CKD group showed differential age-related changes in cerebellar gray matter (Î² = -0.10; 95% CI, -0.18 to -0.01; Cohen f = 0.22) and white matter (Î² = -0.09; 95% CI, -0.19 to -0.00; Cohen f = 0.19). The age Ã group interaction approached but did not reach significance for amygdala volume (Î² = 0.09; 95% CI, -0.01 to 0.19; Cohen f = 0.18; P = .06). Volumetric variation in these regions was associated with proxy ratings of executive function in patients with CKD. A significant, positive association between cerebellar gray matter and eGFR was observed in the CKD group (Î² = 0.04; 95% CI, 0.00 to 0.02; P = .01). In this case-control study, age-related neurodevelopmental differences were observed in pediatric patients with CKD compared with healthy peers. Reductions in cerebellar volume were associated with cognitive deficits and lower kidney function. These findings underscore the importance of monitoring neurodevelopmental trajectories in children with CKD, as early interventions may be necessary to mitigate cognitive impairments associated with CKD."

    "abstract": "Pharmacologic activation of the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway has broad potential applications, including the treatment of cancer and viral infections, which has motivated the synthesis and testing of a diversity of STING agonists as next generation immunotherapeutics. A promising class of STING agonists are the non-nucleotide, small molecule, dimeric-amidobenzimidazoles (diABZI), which have been recently used in the synthesis of polymer- and antibody-drug conjugates to improve pharmacokinetics, modulate biodistribution, and to confer other favorable properties for specific disease applications. These approaches have leveraged diABZI variants functionalized with reactive handles and enzyme-cleavable linkers at the 7-position of the benzimidazole for conjugation to and tunable drug release from carriers. However, since this position does not interact with STING and is exposed from the binding pocket when bound in an \"open lid\" configuration, we sought to evaluate the activity of macromolecular diABZI conjugates that lack enzymatic release and are instead conjugated to polymers via a stable linker. By covalently ligating diABZI to 5 or 20 kDa mPEG chains via an amide bond, we surprisingly found that these conjugates could activate STING <i>in vitro.</i> To further evaluate this phenomenon, we designed a diABZI-functionalized RAFT chain transfer agent that provided an enabling tool for synthesis of large, hydrophilic, dimethylacrylamide (DMA) polymers directly from a single agonist and we found that these conjugates also elicited STING activation <i>in vitro</i> with similar kinetics to highly potent small molecule analogs. We further demonstrated the <i>in vivo</i> activity of these macromolecular diABZI platforms, which inhibited tumor growth to a similar extent as small molecule variants. Using flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy to evaluate intracellular uptake and distribution of Cy5-labeled analogs, our data indicate that although diABZI-DMA conjugates enter cells via endocytosis, they can still colocalize with the ER, suggesting that intracellular trafficking processes can promote delivery of endocytosed macromolecular diABZI compounds to STING. In conclusion, we have described new chemical strategies for the synthesis of stable macromolecular diABZI conjugates with unexpectedly high immunostimulatory potency, findings with potential implications for the design of polymer-drug conjugates for STING agonist delivery that also further motivate investigation of endosomal and intracellular trafficking as an alternative route for achieving STING activation."

    "abstract": "One of the key limitations of electronic health records (EHR) data is that not all health care encounters are observed. The degree to which patient information is captured is referred to as observability. Poor observability, and in particular differential observability, can lead to biased estimates and inference. As such, understanding the degree of observability is important in EHR based studies. In this study, we propose using external data with known observability to assess the degree of overall observability in EHR. We also construct a test for differential observability in the target EHR dataset. Using principles from the transportability literature, we show that we can use a balancing score based weight to estimate the observability of our target outcome. We conduct a series of simulation experiments to understand the conditions under which dataset features must be required to obtain proper inference. To illustrate this, we consider hospital readmissions among patients with end stage renal disease as our outcome of interest. We use administrative claims data, where the outcome is fully observed, as our external data."

The current pilot study utilized data from 32 bisexual women - a subset of the National Couples' Health and Time Study - who completed questionnaires and provided blood samples to index biological aging from DNA methylation data (DunedinPACE, GrimAge2). The mean DunedinPACE score was 1.13 (SD = 0.18), which outpaced chronological aging by 13 % (p < 0.001). Likewise, bisexual women in this sample were, on average, 8.67 (SD = 5.96) years older biologically per GrimAge2 as compared to their chronological age. In covariate adjusted models, those reporting greater internalized homonegativity exhibited significantly greater epigenetic age acceleration (GrimAge2: p = 0.01; DunedinPACE: p = 0.041). Those who reported more frequent anti-bisexual experiences also showed accelerated GrimAge2 (p = 0.023). In contrast, those who reported stronger identity centrality (p = 0.017), stronger identity affirmation (p = 0.029), and more friend support (p = 0.018) - a critical type of support for LGBTQ + individuals - had slower GrimAge2. Depressive symptoms, anxiety and loneliness were not associated with GrimAge2 or DunedinPACE. Results suggest that bisexual women are at risk for accelerated aging, and those who have less internal and external affirmation of their sexual identity may be most at risk."

    "abstract": "Estrogen receptors (ERs) are essential pharmacological targets for treating hormonal disorders and estrogen-dependent malignancies. Selective activation of ERÎ² is hypothesized to provide therapeutic benefit with reduced risk of unwanted estrogenic side-effects associated with ERÎ± activity. However, activating ERÎ² without activating ERÎ± is challenging due to the high sequence and structural homology between the receptor subtypes. We assessed the impact of structural modifications to the parent compound OSU-ERÎ²-12 on receptor subtype binding selectivity using cell-free binding assays. Functional selectivity was evaluated by transactivation in HEK-293 cells overexpressing human or murine ERs. In vivo selectivity was examined through the uterotrophic effects of the analogs after oral administration in estrogen-naÃ¯ve female mice. Furthermore, we evaluated the in vivo pharmacokinetics of the analogs following single-dose intravenous and oral administration. Regarding selectivity, a single compound exhibited greater functional selectivity than OSU-ERÎ²-12 for human ERÎ². However, like others in the meta-carborane series, its poor in vivo pharmacokinetics limit its suitability for further development. Surprisingly, and at odds with their pharmacokinetic and in vitro human activity data, most analogs potently induced uterotrophic effects in estrogen-naÃ¯ve female mice. Further investigation of activity in HEK-293 cells expressing murine ERs revealed species-specific differences in the ER subtype selectivity of these analogs. Our findings highlight species-specific receptor pharmacology and the challenges it poses to characterizing developmental therapeutics in preclinical species. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: This study investigates para- and meta-substituted carborane analogs targeting estrogen receptors (ERs), revealing the greater selectivity of carborane analogs for human ERÎ² compared to the mouse ortholog. These findings shed light on the intricacies of using preclinical species in drug development to predict human pharmacology. The report also provides insights for the refinement and optimization of carborane analogs as potential therapeutic agents for estrogen-related disease states."

The re-emergence of CHIKV has led to new outbreaks, and the expected high prevalence of pain in these global events requires new scientific advances to find more effective solutions. Here we review the main aspects of pain caused by CHIKV infection, such as the anatomy of the affected sites, the prevalence and management of this symptom, the diversity of possible cellular and molecular mechanisms, and finally highlight a promising meningeal pathway to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the unsolved problem of CHIKV-associated pain."

    "title": "Universal conditional networks (UniCoN) for multi-age embryonic cartilage segmentation with Sparsely annotated data.",
    "abstract": "Osteochondrodysplasia, affecting 2-3% of newborns globally, is a group of bone and cartilage disorders that often result in head malformations, contributing to childhood morbidity and reduced quality of life. Current research on this disease using mouse models faces challenges since it involves accurately segmenting (precisely delineating) the developing cartilage in 3D micro-CT images of embryonic mice. Tackling this segmentation task with deep learning (DL) methods is laborious due to the big burden of manual image annotation, expensive due to the high acquisition costs of 3D micro-CT images, and difficult due to embryonic cartilage's complex and rapidly changing shapes. While DL approaches have been proposed to automate cartilage segmentation, most such models have limited accuracy and generalizability, especially across data from different embryonic age groups. To address these limitations, we propose novel DL methods that can be adopted by any DL architectures-including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Transformers, or hybrid models-which effectively leverage age and spatial information to enhance model performance. Specifically, we propose two new mechanisms, one conditioned on discrete age categories and the other on continuous image crop locations, to enable an accurate representation of cartilage shape changes across ages and local shape details throughout the cranial region. Extensive experiments on multi-age cartilage segmentation datasets show significant and consistent performance improvements when integrating our conditional modules into popular DL segmentation architectures. On average, we achieve a 1.7% Dice score increase with minimal computational overhead and a 7.5% improvement on unseen data. These results highlight the potential of our approach for developing robust, universal models capable of handling diverse datasets with limited annotated data, a key challenge in DL-based medical image analysis."

    "title": "Real-world efficacy of tirzepatide in patients with heart failure without diabetes.",
    "abstract": "Tirzepatide, a dual agonist of glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptors, has shown significant cardiovascular benefits in clinical trials. This study investigates the real-world impact of tirzepatide on heart failure (HF) outcomes, leveraging data from the TriNetX platform. Using data from January 1, 2013, to December 01, 2024, we conducted a propensity-matched analysis of two cohorts of patients with HF without diabetes, where the only difference was the use of tirzepatide. The primary outcome was the incidence of acute heart failure (acute HF), with secondary outcomes including major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), chronic kidney disease (CKD), stroke, and coronary arterial disease (CAD). After propensity-matching, 897 patients were compared between the two cohorts in a 4-year follow-up, showing that untreated patients were at higher risk of incident acute HF (HR: 3.12, 95 %CI = 2.240-4.349, log-rank p < 0.001) and MACE (HR: 3.57, 95 %CI = 2.32-5.48, log-rank p < 0.001). Stroke (HR: 2.796, 95 %CI = 1.353-5.776, log-rank p < 0.01), CKD (HR: 1.48, 95 %CI: 1.08-2.03, log-rank p = 0.015), and CAD (HR: 1.474, 95 %CI,1.169-1.859, log-rank p = 0.001) outcomes also favored the treatment cohort. Tirzepatide presents a promising therapeutic option for managing heart failure, with significant metabolic and cardiovascular benefits. These real-world findings reinforce its potential role as a transformative treatment in improving clinical outcomes and quality of life for patients with HF without diabetes."

    "title": "Factors Influencing Liver Cirrhosis Progression in Wilson's Disease Patients: A Retrospective Cohort Study Over 5âYears.",
    "abstract": "Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare autosomal recessive inherited disorder characterized by dysregulated copper metabolism, amenable to treatment with chelating agents. It manifests with hepatic and neurological symptoms, often precipitating the development of liver cirrhosis as a prominent complication. This study aims to elucidate the factors, biomarker alterations, and therapeutic modalities influencing the progression of cirrhosis in WD patients. This retrospective cohort study utilized WD patient data from West China Fourth Hospital (May 2018-September 2023). The primary outcome was the development of cirrhosis in initially cirrhosis-free WD patients. LASSO-COX regression identified predictive factors. The 1:1 propensity score matching generated a matched subgroup for robust Cox regression validation. Among 133 initially cirrhosis-free WD patients, 47 developed cirrhosis during 35.98 (22.04-49.21) months. Significant differences were observed between the cirrhosis and non-cirrhosis groups in age at enrollment, age at WD diagnosis, clinical symptoms, educational levels, and administration of dimercaptosuccinic acid, compound glycyrrhizin polyene, and phosphatidylcholine. Multivariate Cox regression identified age at enrollment (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.038, 95% CI: 1.002-1.075), the use of glycyrrhizin (HR: 0.421, 95% CI: 0.192-0.926), erythrocyte (HR: 0.748, 95% CI: 0.626-0.895), and platelet counts (HR: 0.993, 95% CI: 0.988-0.998) associated with cirrhosis. Robust Cox analysis on the matched subgroup confirmed these findings. Glycyrrhizic acid emerges as a potential hepatoprotective agent for WD patients. Furthermore, the progression of cirrhosis in WD patients is characterized by advanced age and decreased baseline levels of erythrocytes and platelets, suggesting their potential utility as prognostic indicators."

    "abstract": "Epidemiological studies have suggested an association between the inflammatory potential of dietary patterns and Crohn's disease (CD). However, the relationships of these inflammatory dietary determinants with the microbiome remain largely unknown. In this cross-sectional study, we evaluate the association between the inflammatory potential of habitual diet, as assessed by the modified Children-Dietary Inflammatory Index (mC-DII), and the fecal microbiome and metabolome of children with CD in comparison to healthy children. A cross-sectional study including 51 children with CD between 6 and 18 years of age and 50 healthy controls was conducted. Dietary inflammatory potential was measured using the mC-DII, and diet quality was assessed by the Healthy Eating Index (HEI)-2015 and alternate Mediterranean Eating Index (aMed). The microbiome was analyzed using shotgun metagenomic sequencing and untargeted metabolomic analysis. A poor-quality, pro-inflammatory diet, with similar mC-DII, HEI-2015, and aMed scores, was found across healthy children and children with CD. In children with active disease, a pro-inflammatory diet was associated with decreased diversity, increased virulence potential, and expansion of the Proteobacteria phylum dominated by Escherichia coli (E. coli) spp. A positive correlation between E. coli relative abundance and mC-DII was associated with a low intake of a cluster composed of fibers, vitamins, and minerals with anti-inflammatory potential. A negative association between metabolites of fatty acid metabolism and HEI was found. In total, our results suggest that a pro-inflammatory diet may potentiate hallmarks of the inflammation-associated dysbiosis in CD and highlight the need for microbiome-targeted dietary interventions optimizing the anti-inflammatory potential of habitual diet in the management of pediatric CD."

    "abstract": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic lung disease characterized by airway obstruction and inflammation. Non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) lung infections are common in COPD, promoting frequent exacerbations and accelerated lung function decline. The relationship with immune responses and NTHi are poorly understood. Herein, we comprehensively characterized the respiratory microbiome and mycobiome of patients while investigating microbial dynamics and host immune changes attributable to NTHi killing activity. Mild-to-moderate COPD patients encompassing frequent and infrequent exacerbators and healthy volunteers (HV) were enrolled. Microbial composition, proteomics and NTHi killing activity was analyzed using bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). In addition, antigen-antibody titers in sera to COPD pathogens were determined using a multiplex assay. Differential abundance analysis revealed an enrichment of Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes in the BALF of COPD and HV subjects respectively. Significant differences in the IgA titer response were observed against NTHi antigens in COPD vs. HV. Notably, there was also significantly greater killing activity against NTHi in BALF from COPD vs. HV subjects (OR = 5.64; 95% CI = 1.75-20.20; p = 0.001). Stratification of COPD patients by NTHi killing activity identified unique microbial and protein signatures wherein Firmicutes, Actinobacteria and haptoglobin were enriched in patients with killing activity. We report that differences in host immune responses and NTHi-killing activity are associated with microbiome changes in mild-to-moderate COPD. This is suggestive of a potential link between the respiratory microbiome and immune activity against NTHi in the context of COPD pathogenesis even at this disease stage."

    "abstract": "Prostate cancer (PC) is the commonest male visceral cancer, and second leading cause of cancer mortality in men in the Western world. Using a forward-mutagenesis Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon-based screen in a Probasin Cre-Recombinase (Pb-Cre) Pten-deficient mouse model of PC, we identified Arid1a loss as a driver in the development of metastatic disease. The insertion of transposon in the Arid1a gene resulted in a 60% reduction of Arid1a expression, and reduced tumour free survival (SB:Pten<sup>fl/fl</sup> Arid1a<sup>INT</sup> median 226 days vs SB:Pten<sup>fl/fl</sup> Arid1a<sup>WT</sup> 293 days, p = 0.02),with elevated rates of metastasis (SB:Pten<sup>fl/fl</sup> Arid1a<sup>INT</sup> 75% lung metastasis rate vs 17% SB:Pten<sup>fl/fl</sup> Arid1a<sup>WT</sup>, p < 0.001). We further generated a Pb-Cre Pten- and Arid1a-deficient mouse model, in which loss of Arid1a demonstrated a profound acceleration in tumorigenesis in Pten<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice compared to Pten loss alone (Pb-Cre Pten<sup>fl/fl</sup>Arid1a<sup>+/+</sup> median survival of 267 days vs Pb-Cre Pten<sup>fl/fl</sup> Arid1a<sup>fl/fl</sup> 103 days, p < 0.0001). Our data revealed homozygous Arid1a loss is required to dramatically accelerate prostate tumourigenesis. Analysis of RNA and ChIP -Sequencing data suggests Arid1a loss enhanced the function of AP-1 subunit cFos.

    "abstract": "An estimated 10-30% of people with COVID-19 experience debilitating long-term symptoms or long covid. Underlying health conditions associated with chronic inflammation may increase the risk of long covid. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine whether long covid risk was altered by pre-existing asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in adults. We identified studies by searching the PubMed and Embase databases from inception to 13 September 2024. We excluded studies that focused on children or defined long covid only in terms of respiratory symptoms. We used random-effects, restricted maximum likelihood models to analyse data pooled from 51 studies, which included 43 analyses of asthma and 30 analyses of COPD. The risk of bias was assessed using a ROBINS-E table. We found 41% increased odds of long covid with pre-existing asthma (95% CI 1.29 to 1.54); pre-existing COPD was associated with 32% increased odds (95% CI 1.16 to 1.51). Pre-existing asthma, but not COPD, was associated with increased odds of long covid-associated fatigue. We observed heterogeneity in the results of studies of asthma related to hospitalisation status. Potential confounding and inconsistent measurement of exposure and outcome variables were among the identified limitations. Our findings support the hypothesis that pre-existing asthma and COPD increase the risk of long covid, including chronic fatigue outcomes in patients with asthma. Because COVID-19 targets the respiratory tract, these inflammatory conditions of the lower respiratory tract could provide mechanistic clues to a common pathway for the development of long-term sequelae in patients with long covid."

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the therapeutic potential of Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) inhibition combined with microRNA miR-135a-5p overexpression in sepsis-induced acute lung injury (ALI). Specifically, we aimed to elucidate combinatorial therapeutic potential of PARP1 inhibition in mitigating oxidative stress and inflammation across different models, simultaneously miR-135a-5p overexpression promoting regeneration through the SMAD5/Nanog axis. We used C57BL/6 mice to create Cecal Ligation Puncture (CLP) model of Sepsis-induced Acute Lung Injury. RAW264.7 murine macrophages and MLE12 (Mouse Lung Epithelial) cells were stimulated through Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce inflammation. miR-135a-5p mimic Transfection confirmed using one-step Real time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). PARP1 inhibition confirmed by western blotting using Poly (ADP-ribose) (PAR) expression. Reactive oxygen Species (ROS) generation measured through Dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCF-DA) dye using fluorescent microscopy and Nitric Oxide (NO) via spectrophotometry. Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid (BALF) cytokine analysis was done using Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). miRNA mediated signaling, inflammatory markers and cytokines were determined using immunoblotting, RT-qPCR, and immunohistochemistry. miR-135a-5p target validation using dual-luciferase assay. Our results demonstrated that PARP1 inhibition significantly reduced oxidative stress (**P < 0.01) and inflammatory markers in sepsis-induced lung injury models. Specifically, we observed decreased protein levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) (***P < 0.001), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2) (*P < 0.05), phospho-Akt (*P < 0.05), and Tumor necrosis factor-Alpha (TNF-Î±) (*P < 0.05) mRNA expression. We observed significant reduction in ROS and NO generation in macrophages. Moreover, histopathological evidence suggested improved lung health. Concurrently, miR-135a-5p overexpression decreased the expression of SMAD5 (*P < 0.05) which in turns increased the expression of Nanog and related pluripotency genes in epithelial cells and mice, thus promoting regeneration and repair. The combination of PARP1 inhibition and miR-135a-5p overexpression showed significant potential as a therapeutic intervention by reducing inflammation alongside stimulating regenerative environment in Sepsis-induced ALI."

    "abstract": "Globally, an estimated 300 million individuals have sickle cell trait (SCT), the carrier state for sickle cell disease (SCD). Although SCD is associated with increased morbidity and shortened life span, SCT has a life span comparable with that of the general population. However, \"sickle cell crisis\" has been used as a cause of death for decedents with SCT in reports of exertion-related death in athletes, military personnel, and individuals in police custody. To appraise this practice, the American Society of Hematology convened an expert panel of hematologists and forensic pathologists to conduct a systematic review of the literature relating to the occurrence of sickle cell pain crises and exertion-related mortality in people with SCT. Multiple bibliographic databases were searched with controlled vocabulary and keywords related to \"sickle cell trait,\" \"vaso-occlusive pain,\" and \"death,\" yielding 18 of 1474 citations. Independent pairs of reviewers selected studies and extracted data. We found no studies comparing uncomplicated acute pain crises in individuals with SCT and SCD. Additionally, no study was identified to support the occurrence of acute vaso-occlusive pain crises in individuals with SCT. Furthermore, this systematic review did not identify any evidence to support an association between SCT and sudden unexplained death in the absence of exertion-related rhabdomyolysis. We conclude that there are no data to support the diagnosis of acute vaso-occlusive sickle cell crisis as a cause of death in SCT, nor does the available evidence support the use of SCT as a cause of exertion-related death without rhabdomyolysis."

    "abstract": "COVID-19 caused a huge backlog of patients in glaucoma clinics. This study describes redesign of an entire glaucoma service with electronic patient triage to three levels and utilisation of the Scottish optometry infrastructure of upskilled optometrists. 2276 patients in glaucoma clinics were identified and triaged to three levels in keeping with Glauc-strat-fast guidance with local amendments. Every patient detail was entered into a bespoke glaucoma database to include demographics, clinical findings and social deprivation scores. The database generated automatic patient, GP and optometrist letters. Level one patients (482) were discharged within the Scottish general optometry service contract. Level two patients (714) were discharged to glaucoma accredited community optometry clinics. The glaucoma consultants would discuss the optometry decision making through screen share once a week. Level three patients (1080) were retained in hospital. All outcomes were audited and analysed 24 months after the new service. Statistically significant parameters were found between the three groups, to include more normal eyes, less mean deviation on visual fields and less social deprivation in level one patients. After 24 months level one patients had a return rate of 40.2%, mainly for other diseases with only 20.4% retained within hospital or level two. 9.4% of level two patients returned to hospital with retention of only 2.7% in hospital at 24 months. Glaucoma patients in Scotland can be appropriately triaged to glaucoma accredited community optometry clinics. This frees capacity within hospital to see patients with moderate and severe disease in a timely fashion, for best visual outcomes."

    "abstract": "Papilloedema can be the first sign of life-threatening disease, for example, brain tumours. Due to the potential seriousness of this clinical sign, the detection of papilloedema would normally prompt urgent hospital referral for further investigation. The problem is that many benign structural variations of optic nerve anatomy can be mistaken for papilloedema, so-called pseudopapilloedema. The consequence is that many people are referred to hospital because they are incorrectly identified to have papilloedema when they don't. As a result, hospital referrals of people with suspected papilloedema in England have increased sharply, leading to increased demand for overstretched hospital services and potentially longer waiting times for hospital appointments for those who do have papilloedema.The work programme is aimed at the development of guidelines and educational materials that will help support health professionals to correctly identify people with papilloedema. This article describes the protocol for gathering evidence of current referral practices and pathways for people suspected to have papilloedema in England and the development of guidelines based on this evidence and extensive engagement with community- and hospital-based healthcare professionals, patients, and the public. Both qualitative and quantitative data will be collected from Freedom of Information requests to Integrated Care Boards across England about how they organise their community and hospital services for people with suspected papilloedema, with and without headache. Surveys and qualitative interviews of relevant community and hospital healthcare professionals based in England will collect data on how and when people with papilloedema and pseudopapilloedema with or without headache are currently identified and referred to hospital, if needed. This information will be used to inform a Delphi process with the aim of reaching consensus among health professional experts, commissioners and patients on what the most evidence-based and safe diagnostic and referral practices should be for people with suspected papilloedema. The tailored guidelines will be written for healthcare professionals and patients. We will create a range of educational materials and a website designed for health professionals and patients to support the national roll-out and implementation of DIPP study guidelines. Ethical approval was granted by the University of Bristol Faculty of Health Sciences Ethics committee (FREC reference: 12457) and Health Research Authority (IRAS no.: 320395). Results of the study will be published on our DIPP study website and disseminated to our stakeholder groups through peer-reviewed journal publications and conference presentations."

    "abstract": "Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a vector-borne disease caused by the obligate intracellular protozoan <i>Leishmania donovani</i> in India. VL can be complicated by post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL), a macular or nodular rash that develops in 10%-20% of patients after treatment of VL in India. Patients with PKDL are infectious to sand flies, promoting further transmission of the parasite. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are 18-25 nt, non-coding RNAs that simultaneously regulate the expression of several or many target transcripts. This study was based on the hypothesis that the host response to <i>L. donovani</i> is modified by distinct sets of miRNAs in VL or PKDL and that these might differ from healthy controls. We investigated this hypothesis using a NanoString panel to profile the miRNAs expressed in the plasma of patients with VL or PKDL diagnosed at a hospital in Bihar, India. We compared these to plasma microRNAs of healthy control individuals from the same endemic villages. miRNAs <i>hsa-miR-223-3p, hsa-miR-191-5p, hsa-miR-23a-3p,</i> and <i>hsa-1285-5p</i> were significantly higher in the plasma samples from patients with VL compared to either PKDL or endemic controls. Prediction programs highlighted potential mRNA targeted by these miRNAs, among which we verified the down-modulation of several transcripts belonging to the NFÎºB and NLRP3 inflammasome pathways in circulating leukocytes of VL patients. By contrast, miRNA patterns in subjects with PKDL were similar to control subjects, possibly suggesting that the pathogenic immune response during PKDL is primarily localized in the skin.IMPORTANCEInfection of humans with the protozoan <i>Leishmania donovani</i> can be asymptomatic or it can cause fatal visceral leishmaniasis (VL), sometimes followed by the cutaneous complication PKDL. Parasites are spread through sand fly bites in endemic regions, and parasites in post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) skin lesions are a source of prolonged parasite transmission to sand flies, compromising disease eradication efforts. Since microRNAs can simultaneously modify the expression of multiple genes, we examined microRNAs in the blood that might be partial determinants of pathogenic responses leading to VL or PKDL. Our studies revealed several miRNAs expressed that are elevated in the plasma of patients with VL, which suppress some of the inflammatory responses that promote parasite killing. However, miRNA profiles were very similar between PKDL patients and controls, raising the possibility that major factors that lead to prolonged retention of parasites in the skin during PKDL are not systemic but are localized in the skin."

This study investigated the burden and diversity of ARB carried by cockroaches in human settlements in Uganda, so as to understand their role in the spread of these pathogens and their potential as sentinels in antimicrobial resistance (AMR) surveillance programs. <b>Materials and Methods:</b> A retrospective analysis was conducted on two unpublished studies by Makerere University students. Study one and study two sampled 58 and 110 cockroaches, respectively, from secondary schools in Kampala. Cockroach species identification was determined based on physical characteristics. Bacterial isolation and characterization were performed through microbiological analyses including standard culture methods, biochemical tests, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), disc diffusion method, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). <b>Results:</b> Majority of the cockroaches (over 80%) were <i>Periplaneta americana.</i> Multidrug resistance (MDR) was prevalent among the isolates, with over 30% of the isolates being resistant to three or more antibiotic classes. Specifically, MDR (over 90%) was rampant in the extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)- or AmpC-producing <i>Escherichia coli</i> and enterococci isolates. Critical World Health Organization (WHO) priority pathogens, such as ESBL-/AmpC-producing Enterobacteriaceae, and carbapenem-resistant <i>E. coli</i>, were also identified. The most abundant resistance determinants (tetracycline and sulphonamide) were <i>tetA, sul1,</i> and <i>sul2</i> for <i>E. coli</i>, and <i>tetM</i> and <i>tetL</i> for enterococci. <b>Conclusion:</b> The findings accentuate the potential role of cockroaches: (1) in transmitting multidrug-resistant bacteria at the human-animal-environment interface and (2) as sentinels in the surveillance of community-generated AMR."

Using a doubly robust estimation methodology to balance key baseline characteristics between groups, the time-to-incident MALO was compared between 62 patients (68% female) who underwent metabolic surgery and 106 nonsurgical controls (71% female), with a mean follow-up of 10.0 Â± 4.5 years. The 15 year cumulative incidence of MALO was 20.9% (95% confidence interval (CI), 2.5-35.9%) in the surgical group compared with 46.4% (95% CI, 25.6-61.3%) in the nonsurgical group, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 0.28 (95% CI, 0.12-0.64), P = 0.003.

Among patients with compensated MASH-related cirrhosis and obesity, metabolic surgery, compared with nonsurgical management, was associated with a significantly lower risk of incident MALO. In the absence of approved medical therapies for compensated MASH-related cirrhosis, metabolic surgery may represent a safe and effective therapeutic option to influence the trajectory of cirrhosis."

    "abstract": "Protein aggregates in motoneurons, a pathological hallmark of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, have been suggested to play a key pathogenetic role. ALS8, characterized by ER-associated inclusions, is caused by a heterozygous mutation in VAPB, which acts at multiple membrane contact sites between the ER and almost all other organelles. The link between protein aggregation and cellular dysfunction is unclear. A yeast model, expressing human mutant and WT-VAPB under the control of the orthologous yeast promoter in haploid and diploid cells, was developed to mimic the disease situation. Inclusion formation was found to be a developmentally regulated process linked to mitochondrial damage that could be attenuated by reducing ER-mitochondrial contacts. The co-expression of the WT protein retarded P56S-VAPB inclusion formation. Importantly, we validated these results in mammalian motoneuron cells. Our findings indicate that (age-related) damage to mitochondria influences the propensity of the mutant VAPB to form aggregates via ER-mitochondrial contacts, initiating a series of events leading to disease progression."

    "abstract": "Autoimmunity affects 10% of the population. Within this umbrella, autoantibody-mediated diseases targeting one autoantigen provide a unique opportunity to comprehensively understand the developmental pathway of disease-causing B cells and autoantibodies. While such autoreactivities are believed to be generated during germinal centre reactions, the roles of earlier immune checkpoints in autoantigen-specific B cell tolerance are poorly understood. We address this concept in patients with CASPR2-autoantibody encephalitis and healthy controls. In both groups, comparable and high (~0.5%) frequencies of unmutated CASPR2-reactive naÃ¯ve B cells were identified. By contrast, CASPR2-reactive memory B cells were exclusive to patients, and their B cell receptors demonstrated affinity-enhancing somatic mutations with heterogenous binding kinetics. These effector molecules possessed epitope-dependent pathogenic effects <i>in vitro</i> neuronal cultures and <i>in vivo</i>. The unmutated common ancestors of these memory B cells showed a distinctive balance between strong CASPR2 reactivity and very limited binding across the remaining human proteome. Our results are the first to propose mechanisms underlying autoantigen-specific tolerance in humans. We identify permissive central tolerance, defective peripheral tolerance and heterogenous autoantibody binding properties as sequential pathogenic steps which licence CASPR2-directed pathology. By leveraging the basic immunobiology, we rationally direct tolerance-restoring approaches in CASPR2-antibody diseases. This paradigm is applicable across autoimmune conditions."

Diagnoses and treatments are challenging in settings, where advanced diagnostic tests are unavailable, copper chelating agents are frequently scarce, healthcare professionals lack disease awareness, and medical follow-ups are limited. Prompt diagnoses and treatments help prevent complications, improve patients' quality of life, and ensure a normal life expectancy. The clinical presentations and outcomes of WD can vary within a single family. We present the cases of two siblings (19 and 27 years) from a consanguineous family in rural Ecuador, diagnosed as having WD during a family screening. The male patient, diagnosed at age 19 after his brother's death from acute liver failure, presented with compensated cirrhosis, neurological symptoms, and bilateral Kayser-Fleischer rings. He developed progressive neurological deterioration during an irregular treatment with D-penicillamine due to medication shortages. His condition improved upon switching to trientine tetrahydrochloride, and his neurological symptoms improved over an 8-year period of follow-ups. The female patient, diagnosed at age 10, exhibited only biochemical alterations. Her treatment history was similar; however, she remained asymptomatic without disease progression over the same follow-up period. We discuss the potential influence of epigenetic mechanisms and modifier genes on the various phenotypes, emphasizing the need for research in these areas to optimize therapeutic strategies. Our patients' medical histories show how early diagnosis and treatment can prevent disease progression; and, how suboptimal treatments impact disease outcomes."

    "title": "Pericoronary adipose tissue feature analysis in computed tomography calcium score images in comparison to coronary computed tomography angiography.",
    "abstract": "We investigated the feasibility and advantages of using non-contrast CT calcium score (CTCS) images to assess pericoronary adipose tissue (PCAT) and its association with major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). PCAT features from coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) have been shown to be associated with cardiovascular risk but are potentially confounded by iodine. If PCAT in CTCS images can be similarly analyzed, it would avoid this issue and enable its inclusion in formal risk assessment from readily available, low-cost CTCS images. To identify coronaries in CTCS images that have subtle visual evidence of vessels, we registered CTCS with paired CCTA images having coronary labels. We developed an \"axial-disk\" method giving regions for analyzing PCAT features in three main coronary arteries. We analyzed hand-crafted and radiomic features using univariate and multivariate logistic regression prediction of MACE and compared results against those from CCTA. Registration accuracy was sufficient to enable the identification of PCAT regions in CTCS images. Motion or beam hardening artifacts were often prevalent in \"high-contrast\" CCTA but not CTCS. Mean HU and volume were increased in both CTCS and CCTA for the MACE group. There were significant positive correlations between some CTCS and CCTA features, suggesting that similar characteristics were obtained. Using hand-crafted/radiomics from CTCS and CCTA, AUCs were 0.83/0.79 and 0.83/0.77, respectively, whereas Agatston gave AUC = 0.73. Preliminarily, PCAT features can be assessed from three main coronary arteries in non-contrast CTCS images with performance characteristics that are at the very least comparable to CCTA."

    "title": "Mechanisms of Copper-Induced Autophagy and Links with Human Diseases.",
    "abstract": "As a structural and catalytic cofactor, copper is involved in many biological pathways and is required for the biochemistry of all living organisms. However, excess intracellular copper can induce cell death due to its potential to catalyze the generation of reactive oxygen species, thus copper homeostasis is strictly regulated. And the deficiency or accumulation of intracellular copper is connected with various pathological conditions. Since the success of platinum-based compounds in the clinical treatment of various types of neoplasias, metal-based drugs have shown encouraging perspectives for drug development. Compared to platinum, copper is an essential intracellular trace element that may have better prospects for drug development than platinum. Recently, the potential therapeutic role of copper-induced autophagy in chronic diseases such as Parkinson's, Wilson's, and cardiovascular disease has already been demonstrated. In brief, copper ions, numerous copper complexes, and copper-based nano-preparations could induce autophagy, a lysosome-dependent process that plays an important role in various human diseases. In this review, we not only focus on the current advances in elucidating the mechanisms of copper or copper-based compounds/preparations on the regulation of autophagy but also outline the association between copper-induced autophagy and human diseases."

    "abstract": "Autophagy and mitophagy are critical cellular processes that maintain homeostasis by removing damaged organelles and promoting cellular survival under stress conditions. In the context of diabetic kidney disease, these mechanisms play essential roles in mitigating cellular damage. This review provides an in-depth analysis of the recent literature on the relationship between autophagy, mitophagy, and diabetic kidney disease, highlighting the current state of knowledge, existing research gaps, and potential areas for future investigations. Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is traditionally defined as a specific form of kidney disease caused by long-standing diabetes, characterized by the classic histological lesions in the kidney, including mesangial expansion, glomerular basement membrane thickening, nodular glomerulosclerosis (Kimmelstiel-Wilson nodules), and podocyte injury. Clinical markers for DN are albuminuria and the gradual decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is a broader and more inclusive term, for all forms of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in individuals with diabetes, regardless of the underlying pathology. This includes patients who may have diabetes-associated kidney damage without the typical histological findings of diabetic nephropathy. It also accounts for patients with other coexisting kidney diseases (e.g., hypertensive nephrosclerosis, ischemic nephropathy, tubulointerstitial nephropathies), even in the absence of albuminuria, such as a reduction in GFR."

    "title": "<i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> and Rabies-The Parasite, the Virus, or Both?",
    "abstract": "<i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> is an intracellular protozoan parasite that infects a wide range of vertebrates, including humans. Although cats are the only definitive host, any warm-blooded animal can act as a paratenic host. Throughout the years, this apicomplexan parasite has been studied due to its wide prevalence, zoonotic potential, and host behavioral alterations. Known for its neurological alterations, the rabies virus is one of the most recognized types of zoonosis that, although preventable, still causes deaths in humans and animals worldwide. Due to the overlapping clinical signs of these two pathogens, the objective of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of <i>T. gondii</i> DNA in cerebellum tissue collected for rabies testing; cerebellum tissue from diverse animals is often submitted for this purpose. Between May 2022 and April 2024, we tested 903 cerebellum tissue samples from 22 animal species submitted for rabies testing to the Oklahoma Animal Diagnostic Disease Laboratory. Overall, <i>T. gondii</i> prevalence was 3.96%, with 1.8% found in cats (<i>Felis catus</i>), 1.7% in dogs (<i>Canis familiaris</i>), 0.3% in skunks (<i>Mephitis mephitis</i>), and 0.2% in infected cattle (<i>Bos taurus</i>). Analysis among <i>T. gondii</i>-positive hosts revealed a statistically significant difference in dogs when comparing neutered vs. intact males, with 7.94% (5/63) <i>T. gondii</i>-positive neutered males and 1.61% (3/186) <i>T. gondii</i>-positive intact males (<i>p</i> = 0.02). All the <i>T. gondii</i>-positive samples were negative for rabies. Anamnesis in some of the <i>T. gondii</i>-positive samples included ataxia, aggression, muscle rigidity, lethargy, and seizures, with the latter also described in dogs and aggression in the positive bovine sample. The clinical signs described in the <i>T. gondii</i>-infected hosts can be mistaken for rabies infection; therefore, it is important to consider <i>T. gondii</i> as a differential diagnosis in suspected rabies cases and test for this parasite when negative rabies results are obtained."

    "abstract": "An intriguing aspect of restrictive cardiomyopathies (RCM) is the microbiome role in the natural history of the disease. These cardiomyopathies are often difficult to diagnose and so result in significant morbidity and mortality. The human microbiome, composed of billions of microorganisms, influences various physiological and pathological processes, including cardiovascular health. Studies have shown that gut dysbiosis, an imbalance in the composition of intestinal bacteria, can contribute to systemic inflammation, a key factor in many cardiovascular conditions. An increase in gut permeability, frequently caused by dysbiosis, allows bacterial endotoxins to enter the bloodstream, activating inflammatory pathways that exacerbate cardiac dysfunction. Recent reports highlight the potential role of microbiome in amyloidogenesis, as certain bacteria produce proteins that accelerate the formation of amyloid fibrils. Concurrently, advancements in amyloidosis treatments have sparked renewed hopes, marking a promising era for managing these kinds of diseases. These findings suggest that the gut-heart axis may be a potential factor in the development and progression of cardiovascular disease like RCM, opening new paths for therapeutic intervention. The aim of this review is to provide a detailed overview of the gut-heart axis, focusing on RCM."

    "abstract": "Metabolic abnormalities associated with liver disease have a significant impact on the risk and prognosis of cholecystitis. However, the underlying mechanism remains to be elucidated. Here, we investigated this issue using Wilson's disease (WD) as a model, which is a genetic disorder characterized by impaired mitochondrial function and copper metabolism. Our retrospective clinical study found that WD patients have a significantly higher incidence of cholecystitis and a poorer prognosis. The hepatic immune cell landscape using single-cell RNA sequencing showed that the tissue immune microenvironment is altered in WD, mainly a major change in the constitution and function of the innate immune system. Exhaustion of natural killer (NK) cells is the fundamental factor, supported by the upregulated expression of inhibitory receptors and the downregulated expression of cytotoxic molecules, which was verified in clinical samples. Further bioinformatic analysis confirmed a positive correlation between NK cell exhaustion and poor prognosis in cholecystitis and other inflammatory diseases. The study demonstrated dysfunction of liver immune cells triggered by specific metabolic abnormalities in WD, with a focus on the correlation between NK cell exhaustion and poor healing of cholecystitis, providing new insights into the improvement of inflammatory diseases by assessing immune cell function."

    "abstract": "Cases for a disease can be defined broadly using diagnostic codes, or narrowly using gold-standard confirmation that often is not available in large administrative datasets. These different definitions can have significant impacts on the results and conclusions of studies. We conducted this study to assess how using melanoma phecodes versus histologic confirmation for invasive or in situ melanoma impacts the results of a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using the Million Veteran Program. Melanoma status was determined three ways: (1) by the presence of two or more phecodes, (2) histologically-confirmed invasive melanoma, and (3) histologically-confirmed melanoma in situ. We conducted a GWAS for variants with minor allele frequencies of 1% or greater. There were 45,665 cases in the phecode cohort, 5364 cases in the confirmed invasive melanoma cohort, and 4792 cases in the confirmed melanoma in situ cohort. There were 20,457 variants significant at the genome-wide level in the phecode cohort, 2582 in the invasive melanoma cohort, and 1989 in the melanoma in situ cohort. Most of the variants identified in the phecode cohort did not replicate in the histologically-confirmed cohorts. The different case definitions led to large differences in sample size and variants associated at the genome-wide level. Unvalidated and imprecise case definitions can lead to less accurate results. Investigators should use validated phenotypes when gold-standard definitions are not available."

This scoping review aimed to synthesize evidence on PD education and training available to care home staff, examine existing programs and their effectiveness, and identify gaps in current educational approaches. A scoping review (ScR) was conducted and guided by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis extension for ScR (PRISMA-ScR) checklist. A comprehensive search of six electronic databases was conducted in September 2024. Studies focusing on PD education and training for care home staff were included. Data extraction and quality appraisal were performed, followed by thematic analysis to identify key patterns and themes. Seven studies met the inclusion criteria. The thematic analysis revealed four main themes: improvements in PD knowledge and confidence, improvements in care practices and outcomes, the need for increased specialist education, and the incorporation of communication training. Educational interventions led to significant improvements in staff knowledge, confidence, and care practices. However, these studies also highlighted a critical need for more specialized PD training among care home staff. This review provides evidence of promise regarding the potential impact of PD-specific education on care home staff knowledge and practices. Future research should focus on developing and evaluating comprehensive, tailored educational programs to enhance the quality of care for people with PD in care home settings."

Our objectives were to assess whether the risk of respiratory and neurologic PASC differs by race/ethnicity and social drivers of health. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of individuals <21 years seeking care at 24 health systems across the U.S, using electronic health record (EHR) data. Our cohort included those with a positive SARS-CoV-2 molecular, serology or antigen test, or with a COVID-19, multisystem inflammatory disease in children, or PASC diagnosis from February 29, 2020 to August 1, 2022. We identified children/youth with at least 2 codes associated with respiratory and neurologic PASC. We measured associations between sociodemographic and clinical characteristics and respiratory and neurologic PASC using odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals estimated from multivariable logistic regression models adjusted for other sociodemographic characteristics, social vulnerability index or area deprivation index, time period of cohort entry, presence and complexity of chronic respiratory (respectively, neurologic) condition and healthcare utilization. Among 771,725 children in the cohort, 203,365 (26.3%) had SARS-CoV-2 infection. Among children with documented infection, 3217 children had respiratory PASC and 2009 children/youth had neurologic PASC. In logistic regression models, children <5 years (Odds Ratio [OR] 1.78, 95% CI 1.62-1.97), and of Hispanic White descent (OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.05-1.35) had higher odds of having respiratory PASC. Children/youth living in regions with higher area deprivation indices (OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.10-1.420 for 60-79th percentile) and with chronic complex respiratory conditions (OR 3.28, 95% CI 2.91-3.70) also had higher odds of respiratory PASC. In contrast, older (OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.40-1.77 for those aged 12-17 years), non-Hispanic White individuals and those with chronic pre-existing neurologic conditions (OR 2.04, 95% CI 1.78-2.35) were more likely to have a neurologic PASC diagnosis. Racial and ethnic differences in healthcare utilization for neurologic and respiratory PASC may reflect social drivers of health and inequities in access to care. National Institutes of Health."

Patients received pembrolizumab 200 mg Q3W for â¥35 cycles. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR) per RECIST v1.1 by central review. Secondary endpoints included duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and safety. As of January 12, 2022, median (range) follow-up in the MSI-H/dMMR (n = 94) and non-MSI-H/non-dMMR (n = 96) groups was 54.5 (14.7-71.4) and 68.3 (64.3-71.9) months, respectively. The ORR (95 % CI) was 50 % (40 %-61 %) in the MSI-H/dMMR group; 15 patients (16 %) experienced a complete response, 32 (34 %) experienced a partial response. The ORR (95 % CI) in the non-MSI-H/non-dMMR group was 7 % (3 %-14 %); 7 patients (7 %) experienced a partial response, none experienced a complete response. The estimated 4-year DOR rates were 66 % and 56 %, respectively. Median PFS was 13.1 (95 % CI, 4.3-25.7) months in the MSI-H/dMMR group and 2.1 (95 % CI, 2.1-2.2) months in the non-MSI-H/non-dMMR group. Median OS was 65.4 (95 % CI, 29.5-not reached) and 11.1 (95 % CI, 8.1-15.3) months, respectively. Toxicity was manageable in both groups.

The direct measurement of signature peptides as a surrogate marker for the protein in dried blood spots (DBSs) has been shown to successfully identify patients with Wilson Disease (WD) and three life-threatening inborn errors of immunity, X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA), Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS), and adenosine deaminase deficiency (ADAD). A novel proteomic-based multiplex assay to detect these four conditions from DBS using high-throughput LC-MS/MS was developed and validated. The clinical validation results showed that the assay can accurately identify patients of targeted disorders from controls. Additionally, 30,024 newborn DBS samples from the Washington State Department of Health Newborn Screening Laboratory have been screened from 2022 to 2024. One true presumptive positive case of WD was found along with three false positive cases. Five false positives for WAS were detected, but all of them were premature and/or low-birth-weight babies and four of them had insufficient DNA for confirmation.

With the use of next-generation sequencing (NGS) as a first-tier screen, NBS could expand to include IMDs that lack a reliable biochemical footprint in dried blood spots, while also reducing secondary findings. To be eligible for inclusion in NBS, an IMD needs to fulfill the Wilson and Jungner criteria, with treatability being one of the most important criteria. In this study, we aimed to identify IMDs eligible for DNA-first NBS when considering only treatability in the context of NBS as a prerequisite. First, three independent reviewers performed a systematic literature review of the 1459 genotypic IMDs and their causative gene(s), as described in the International Classification of Inherited Metabolic Disorders (dated 1 February 2021), applying 16 criteria to exclude non-treatable disorders. Eligible disorders were then discussed in three online meetings with a project group of clinical laboratory geneticists, medical laboratory specialists specialized in IMD, and pediatricians with expertise in IMDs. Based on treatability, we identified 100 genes, causing 95 IMDs, as eligible for NBS, including 42 causal genes for the IMDs in the current biomarker-based NBS. The other 58 genes are primarily associated with treatable defects in amino acid metabolism and fatty acid oxidation. Other IMDs were excluded, most often because of insufficient literature. As the evaluation of treatability was not straightforward, we recommend the development of standardized treatability scores for the inclusion of IMDs in NBS."

    "abstract": "Rare forms of dementia bring unique difficulties related to age of onset, impact on family commitments, employment and finances, and also bring distinctive needs for support and care. The aim of the present study was to explore and better understand what the concept of support means for people living with different rare dementia (PLwRD) and their care-partners who attend ongoing support groups. Representing seven types of rare dementia, source material was collected from 177 PLwRD and care-partners attending in-person support groups, with the goal of developing research-informed group poems, co-constructed by a facilitating poet. Data were analyzed through a three-step process involving linguistic analysis followed by structured-tabular thematic analysis, relational analysis, and concluded with an online survey about participation in the study. Linguistic analysis found that co-constructed poems remained faithful to the original source material offered by participants. These results provided confidence to subsequently conduct a thematic analysis of eight completed poems, identifying 15 initial themes. A further relational analysis between themes drew on six relational forms and identified an overarching theme \"A Community, Not an Intervention\" that describes the process of support for this population. Survey results revealed a varied but generally positive response to writing whilst reactions to the completed poems reflected strong emotional connections that resonated with personal experience. This is the first study that we are aware of to explore the use of co-constructed research poetry to better understand how in-person support groups provide support for people impacted by different rare dementias. The poems portray the complex, dynamic and relational aspects of how support groups provide a necessary form of connection for this population. An overarching theme characterized the support groups as a community rather than an intervention. Findings are discussed within the theoretical context of positive social identity, social health and biosocial groups. The results also demonstrate that solicited words from participants can be faithfully portrayed in poems co-created by an experienced poet. This novel finding expands methodological options for the use of research poetry in healthcare and also offers support group members further creative choices for engagement, connection and communication."

SCI, a debilitating disruption of the structural and biological network of the spinal cord, is characterized by oxidative stress. Nevertheless, the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to neuronal loss following SCI remain incompletely defined. Using a contusion model, a severe SCI was induced at the L1 spinal level in C57Bl/6J mice. The temporal and spatial presence of DNA damage was then determined via immunolabeling for the DNA damage marker, Î³H2AX, from 1 h post-injury (hpi) to 28 days post-injury (dpi). Our analysis revealed that increased DNA damage foci were present from 1 hpi to 3 dpi in SCI mice relative to controls (sham surgery and naive), with the damage signal spreading over time longitudinally from the affected area to more rostral and caudal regions. Co-labeling of Î³H2AX with NeuN revealed neuronal specificity of DNA damage, with increased early cell death (pan-nuclear Î³H2AX) peaking at 1 dpi and apoptosis (cleaved Caspase-3) arising later at 3 dpi. Our study indicates a possible role of DNA damage in neuronal loss following SCI and highlights the need for early interventions targeting DNA repair to preserve neuronal tissue."

    "abstract": "Assembly of actin-based stereocilia is critical for cochlear hair cells to detect sound. To tune their mechanosensivity, stereocilia form bundles composed of graded rows of ascending height, necessitating the precise control of actin polymerization. Myosin 15 (MYO15A) drives hair bundle development by delivering critical proteins to growing stereocilia that regulate actin polymerization via an unknown mechanism. Here, we show that MYO15A is itself an actin nucleation-promoting factor. Moreover, a deafness-causing mutation in the MYO15A actin-binding interface inhibits nucleation activity but still preserves some movement on filaments in vitro and partial trafficking on stereocilia in vivo. Stereocilia fail to elongate correctly in this mutant mouse, providing evidence that MYO15A-driven actin nucleation contributes to hair bundle biogenesis. Our work shows that in addition to generating force and motility, the ATPase domain of MYO15A can directly regulate actin polymerization and that disrupting this activity can promote cytoskeletal disease, such as hearing loss."

Other postviral and autoimmune conditions have a female predominance, but whether the same is true for long COVID, especially within different subgroups, is uncertain. To evaluate sex differences in the risk of developing long COVID among adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection. This cohort study used data from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Researching COVID to Enhance Recovery (RECOVER)-Adult cohort, which consists of individuals enrolled in and prospectively followed up at 83 sites in 33 US states plus Washington, DC, and Puerto Rico. Data were examined from all participants enrolled between October 29, 2021, and July 5, 2024, who had a qualifying study visit 6 months or more after their initial SARS-CoV-2 infection. Self-reported sex (male, female) assigned at birth. Development of long COVID, measured using a self-reported symptom-based questionnaire and scoring guideline at the first study visit that occurred at least 6 months after infection. Propensity score matching was used to estimate risk ratios (RRs) and risk differences (95% CIs). The full model included demographic and clinical characteristics and social determinants of health, and the reduced model included only age, race, and ethnicity. Among 12 276 participants who had experienced SARS-CoV-2 infection (8969 [73%] female; mean [SD] age at infection, 46 [15] years), female sex was associated with higher risk of long COVID in the primary full (RR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.06-1.62) and reduced (RR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.17-1.77) models. This finding was observed across all age groups except 18 to 39 years (RR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.72-1.49). Female sex was associated with significantly higher overall long COVID risk when the analysis was restricted to nonpregnant participants (RR, 1.50; 95%: CI, 1.27-1.77). Among participants aged 40 to 54 years, the risk ratio was 1.42 (95% CI, 0.99-2.03) in menopausal female participants and 1.45 (95% CI, 1.15-1.83) in nonmenopausal female participants compared with male participants. In this prospective cohort study of the NIH RECOVER-Adult cohort, female sex was associated with an increased risk of long COVID compared with male sex, and this association was age, pregnancy, and menopausal status dependent. These findings highlight the need to identify biological mechanisms contributing to sex specificity to facilitate risk stratification, targeted drug development, and improved management of long COVID."

This study involved 242 patients, randomly assigned to training (170) and validation (72) cohorts. Preoperative CT and 3D CT radiomic features were used to develop a model predicting pNETs aggressiveness. The aggressiveness of pNETs was characterized by a combination of factors including G3 grade, nodal involvement (N + status), presence of distant metastases, and/or recurrence of the disease. Three distinct predictive models were constructed to evaluate the aggressiveness of pNETs using CT features, 3D CT radiomic features, and their combination.

Subsequently, a nomogram was developed using the features from the combined model, displaying strong alignment between actual observations and predictions as indicated by the calibration curves. Using a nomogram score of 86.06, patients were classified into high- and low-aggressiveness groups, with the high-aggressiveness group demonstrating poorer overall survival and shorter disease-free survival. This study presents a combined model incorporating CT and 3D CT radiomic features, which accurately predicts the aggressiveness of PNETs preoperatively."

    "title": "The multifaceted role of XCL1 in health and disease.",
    "abstract": "The chemokine XC motif chemokine ligand 1 (XCL1) is an unusually specialized member of a conserved family of around 50 small, secreted proteins that are best known for their ability to stimulate the directional migration of cells. All chemokines adopt a very similar folded structure that binds a specific G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), and most chemokines bind extracellular matrix glycosaminoglycans, often in a dimeric or oligomeric form. Owing in part to the lack of a disulfide bond that is conserved in all other chemokines, XCL1 interconverts between two distinct structures with distinct functions. One XCL1 fold resembles the structure of all other chemokines (chemokine fold), while the other does not (alternate fold). The chemokine fold of XCL1 displays high affinity for the GPCR XCR1, while the alternative fold binds GAGs and exhibits antimicrobial activity. Although the canonical role of XCL1 as a CD8+ dendritic cell chemoattractant was defined more than a decade ago, the misconception that XCL1 is a lymphocyte-specific chemoattractant still prevails in the recent literature. This review aims to highlight the structure-guided functions of XCL1 and reclarify its immunological role. In addition, the implications of this metamorphic chemokine in vaccine development and emerging functions in the nervous system will be explored."

    "abstract": "The pathophysiology of dystonia in Wilson disease (WD) is complex and poorly understood. Copper accumulation in the basal ganglia, disrupts dopaminergic pathways, contributing to dystonia's development via neurotransmitter imbalance. Despite advances in diagnosis and management, WD with dystonia remains a challenging condition to treat. We aim to report the unprecedented co-occurrence of pathogenic genetic variants in both the ATP7B and KMT2B genes in a patient with WD. A 13-year-old male presented at 12 with dysarthria and bilateral Kayser-Fleischer rings. Over months, dystonia spread to his left foot, upper limb, and trunk, accompanied by slowed daily activities. Diagnostic tests included MRI for brain structure, abdominal ultrasound for liver function, serum ceruloplasmin and copper levels to assess copper metabolism, and 24-hour urine copper tests for excretion levels. Whole exome sequencing was conducted using genomic DNA from peripheral blood samples. Variant classification followed guidelines from the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics. The sequencing revealed compound heterozygous pathogenic variants in the ATP7B gene: NM_000053.4:c.2165dupT and NM_000053.4:c.813C>A. A pathogenic variant in the KMT2B gene, NM_014727:c.3052delA, was identified. This case highlights WD co-occurrence with ATP7B and KMT2B mutations, suggesting KMT2B as a potential genetic modifier."

    "abstract": "Twenty-four-hour urinary copper excretion (24 h-UCE) is the standard diagnostic tool for dose adjustments in maintenance therapy in Wilson disease (WD) patients. Guidelines lack data if both variants of 24 h-UCE measurement (with or without 48 h of treatment interruption) are equally interpretable. Eighty-four patients with a confirmed diagnosis of WD treated with chelators (50% of patients with D-Penicillamine and 50% with trientine) and with pairwise 24-h-UCE values on-therapy and off-therapy were included in the analysis. Pairwise urinary sampling between October 2022 (T0) and a 12-month FU (T2) was compared, and exchangeable copper (CuEXC) was additionally measured at T0. Among the 84 patients, 65% had predominant hepatic symptoms, the median age was 42 years, and 58% were female. At T0, patients were in the stable maintenance phase, with a median treatment duration of 21.9 years. The levels of the biochemical markers liver and copper metabolism remained stable over the 12-month observation period for all patients. 24 h-UCE off-therapy significantly decreased from T0 to T2 (p = 0.03), whereas no statistically significant differences were detected for 24 h-UCE after therapy. Both sampling methods did not correlate. CuEXC was significantly correlated with 24 h-UCE after 48 h of dose interruption (p = 0.018) but not with 24 h-UCE after therapy. A total of 46% of the 24 h-UCE value pairs were discordant, laying out the aimed therapeutic ranges given in current international guidelines. Off-therapy 24 h-UCE reflects the \"free\" copper pool more accurately than does urinary sampling. The study shows discordant results for both sampling methods in approximately half of the patients, revealing that interpretation of 24 h-UCE with respect to chelator-dosing decisions should be performed with caution."

    "abstract": "Endometriosis is a chronic gynecological disease that affects 1 in 10 reproductive-aged women. Most studies investigate established disease; however, the initiation and early events in endometriotic lesion development remain poorly understood. Our study used neutrophils from human menstrual effluent from patients with and without endometriosis for immunophenotyping, and it used a mouse model of endometriosis and a mouse endometriosis cell line to determine the role of neutrophils in the initiating events of endometriosis, including attachment and survival of minced endometrial pieces. In menstrual effluent from women with endometriosis, the ratios of aged and proangiogenic neutrophils increased compared with controls, indicating a potentially permissive proinflammatory microenvironment. In our endometriosis mouse model, knocking down neutrophil recruitment with Î±-CXCR2 into the peritoneum decreased endometrial tissue adhesion - supported by decreased levels of myeloperoxidase and neutrophil elastase in both developing lesions and peritoneal fluid. Fibrinogen was identified as the preferred substrate for endometrial cell adhesion in an in vitro adhesion assay and in developing lesions in vivo. Together, aged and proangiogenic neutrophils and their secretions likely promote attachment and formation of endometriotic lesions by releasing neutrophil extracellular traps and upregulating fibrinogen expression as a provisional matrix to establish attachment and survival in the development of endometriosis lesions."

    "title": "Nowcasting to Monitor Real-Time Mpox Trends During the 2022 Outbreak in New York City: Evaluation Using Reportable Disease Data Stratified by Race or Ethnicity.",
    "abstract": "Applying nowcasting methods to partially accrued reportable disease data can help policymakers interpret recent epidemic trends despite data lags and quickly identify and remediate health inequities. During the 2022 mpox outbreak in New York City, we applied Nowcasting by Bayesian Smoothing (NobBS) to estimate recent cases, citywide and stratified by race or ethnicity (Black or African American, Hispanic or Latino, and White). However, in real time, it was unclear if the estimates were accurate. We evaluated the accuracy of estimated mpox case counts across a range of NobBS implementation options. We evaluated NobBS performance for New York City residents with a confirmed or probable mpox diagnosis or illness onset from July 8 through September 30, 2022, as compared with fully accrued cases. We used the exponentiated average log score (average score) to compare moving window lengths, stratifying or not by race or ethnicity, diagnosis and onset dates, and daily and weekly aggregation. During the study period, 3305 New York City residents were diagnosed with mpox (median 4, IQR 3-5 days from diagnosis to diagnosis report). Of these, 812 (25%) had missing onset dates, and of these, 230 (28%) had unknown race or ethnicity. The median lag in days from onset to onset report was 10 (IQR 7-14). For daily hindcasts by diagnosis date, the average score was 0.27 for the 14-day moving window used in real time. Average scores improved (increased) with longer moving windows (maximum: 0.47 for 49-day window). Stratifying by race or ethnicity improved performance, with an overall average score of 0.38 for the 14-day moving window (maximum: 0.57 for 49 day-window). Hindcasts for White patients performed best, with average scores of 0.45 for the 14-day window and 0.75 for the 49-day window. For unstratified, daily hindcasts by onset date, the average score ranged from 0.16 for the 42-day window to 0.30 for the 14-day window. Performance was not improved by weekly aggregation. Hindcasts underestimated diagnoses in early August after the epidemic peaked, then overestimated diagnoses in late August as the epidemic waned. Estimates were most accurate during September when cases were low and stable. Performance was better when hindcasting by diagnosis date than by onset date, consistent with shorter lags and higher completeness for diagnoses. For daily hindcasts by diagnosis date, longer moving windows performed better, but direct comparisons are limited because longer windows could only be assessed after case counts in this outbreak had stabilized. Stratification by race or ethnicity improved performance and identified differences in epidemic trends across patient groups. Contributors to differences in performance across strata might include differences in case volume, epidemic trends, delay distributions, and interview success rates. Health departments need reliable nowcasting and rapid evaluation tools, particularly to promote health equity by ensuring accurate estimates within all strata."

    "abstract": "Organic fluorescence and colorimetric probes have emerged as vital tools for detecting metal ions, due to their high sensitivity, selectivity, and rapid response times. Copper, an essential trace element, plays a critical role in biological systems, yet its imbalance can lead to severe disorders such as neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, and Wilson's disease. Over the past few years, advancements in probe design have unlocked innovative avenues for not only detecting Cu<sup>2+</sup> in environmental and biological samples but also for visualizing its distribution through fluorescence imaging. These probes offering robust performance under diverse conditions. Fluorescence imaging using these probes plays a pivotal role in cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment monitoring by offering real-time visualization of tumor morphology and biomolecular interactions at cellular and tissue levels. This review aims to explore the diversity of organic fluorescence and colorimetric probes developed for the detection of Cu<sup>2+</sup>, with a particular focus on their applications in fluorescence imaging from 2020 to 2024. The discussion highlights the use of these probes in visualizing Cu<sup>2+</sup> in various cancer cells such as SiHa, HCT 116, GES-1, RAW 264.7, HepG2, HeLa, MCF-7 and DrG cell lines, tissues, and small living organisms. By targeting cancer-specific pathways and monitoring copper-related physiological changes, these probes have significantly advanced the fields of cancer diagnostics and therapeutics. This comprehensive analysis emphasizes the potential of fluorescence imaging as a powerful tool for elucidating the roles of Cu<sup>2+</sup> in health and disease, paving the way for future advances in biomedical research."

    "abstract": "People with diabetes are at increased risk of hospitalisation, morbidity, and mortality following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Long-term outcomes for people with diabetes previously hospitalised with COVID-19 are, however, unknown. This study aimed to determine the longer-term physical and mental health effects of COVID-19 in people with and without diabetes. The PHOSP-COVID study is a multicentre, long-term follow-up study of adults discharged from hospital between 1 February 2020 and 31 March 2021 in the UK following COVID-19, involving detailed assessment at 5 and 12 months after discharge. The association between diabetes status and outcomes were explored using multivariable linear and logistic regressions. People with diabetes who survived hospital admission with COVID-19 display worse physical outcomes compared to those without diabetes at 5- and 12-month follow-up. People with diabetes displayed higher fatigue (only at 5 months), frailty, lower physical performance, and health-related quality of life and poorer cognitive function. Differences in outcomes between diabetes status groups were largely consistent from 5 to 12-months. In regression models, differences at 5 and 12 months were attenuated after adjustment for BMI and presence of other long-term conditions. People with diabetes reported worse physical outcomes up to 12 months after hospital discharge with COVID-19 compared to those without diabetes. These data support the need to reduce inequalities in long-term physical and mental health effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection in people with diabetes.

    "abstract": "Diabetes is the leading cause of kidney disease and contributes to 38% of kidney failure requiring dialysis. A gap in detection and management of type 2 diabetes (T2D) in chronic kidney disease (CKD) exists in primary care. Community pharmacists are positioned to support those not able to access kidney care through traditional pathways. Algorithms were developed and validated to assist community pharmacists in identifying individuals with T2D in CKD and prescribing kidney-protective medications. The objective was to develop and validate pharmacist algorithms to confirm T2D and CKD and to prescribe guideline-directed therapies for individuals with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 30 to 60 mL/min/1.73 mÂ² in community pharmacy primary care clinics in Nova Scotia. Lynn's method was utilized for algorithm development and content validation. Interview data were analyzed using qualitative descriptive analysis. Pharmacists working in primary care clinic settings completed content and face algorithm validation, and virtual interviews were conducted following each round of validation. The algorithms aim to support individuals with T2D and CKD in primary care by optimizing the resources and capacity of community pharmacists while ensuring safety and quality of care through a team-based approach. Patient partners were not part of algorithm development and validation. Content validity was computed using an item-level content validity index (I-CVI) and scale-level content validity index (S-CVI/Ave) per round. To measure face validity, percentages of those that \"agreed\" or \"strongly agreed\" to five statements were calculated. Evidence- and expert-informed algorithms were developed and revised using Lynn's 3-step method (domain identification, item generation per domain, and instrument formation). Best evidence was collated with literature searches, and experts in nephrology, endocrinology, family medicine, nursing, and pharmacy revised the algorithms until there was consensus agreement on 4 final algorithms (detection of T2D and CKD, initiation/titration of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, and initiation/management of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors and finerenone). Six community pharmacists per round for 3 rounds were needed to validate the algorithms. A 2-part questionnaire was utilized where pharmacists rated content and face validity using Likert scales. I-CVI and S-CVI/Ave per round and across 3 rounds were determined. Percentages were calculated for the rating level of agreement to 5 statements. Interviews were conducted and analyzed. Revisions were made to the algorithms between rounds. Eighteen community pharmacists (6 per round) participated with a mean Â± standard deviation of 18 Â±11 years of experience. The I-CVI of each item of the algorithms per round ranged from 0.83 to 1, which met the content validity threshold of 0.83 (<i>P</i> < .05) for at least 6 participants. The overall S-CVI/Ave across 3 rounds was 0.97. The overall percentage of participants across 3 rounds who agreed or strongly agreed to 5 face validity statements ranged from 83% to 100%, which was above the prespecified threshold for face validity consensus. The algorithms are intended for individuals with an eGFR of 30 to 60 mL/min/1.73mÂ². While guideline medications are indicated below this threshold, this cut point was selected as these individuals should typically be referred to a nephrologist. There is a potential for delays in initiation of kidney-protective medications below this threshold while waiting to be seen by nephrology. This is the first study to develop and validate algorithms for a new model of care that utilizes community pharmacists to identify and manage T2D and CKD in primary care. The algorithms achieved high content and face validity. Future implementation and evaluation will determine the effectiveness and safety of the algorithms. Not registered."

The current research hotspots and future development trends in TMAO and CVD field are found through bibliometrics analysis, which provides reference for further study. The bibliometrics tools VOSviewer and CiteSpace were used to analyze the publications from the Web of Science Core Collection (WOSCC) database. The articles published from 2004 to 2024 about the relationship between TMAO and CVD were retrieved. Bibliometric analysis includes annual publications, countries/regions, institutions, authors and co-cited authors, journals and cited-journals, references and keywords. After searching and screening, 1,466 publications were included for subsequent bibliometric analysis. Since 2014, the number of publications exposing the relationship between TMAO and CVD has increased rapidly, as has the frequency of citations. China, USA and Italy are the countries that publish the most relevant research. Cleveland Clinic is the leading institution in this field. Stanley L Hazen, Zeneng Wang and W H Wilson Tang are the most prolific authors in this field, and the latter two have the closest academic cooperation. <i>American Journal of Clinical Nutrition</i> and <i>Journal of the American Heart Association</i> are influential journals that publish research in this field. \"<i>Gut Microbial Metabolite TMAO Enhances Platelet Hyperreactivity and Thrombosis Risk</i>\" is the most frequently cited article. Keyword analysis shows that gut microbiota, metabolism, phosphatidylcholine and atherosclerosis (AS) are the hotspots in this field. This study summarizes the research situation of TMAO and CVD in the past 20 years, focusing on the effect of TMAO on pathogenesis of AS, predictive value of TMAO on CVD risk, and dietary and drug intervention for TMAO. Probiotics and natural products may be the research focus of preventing and treating CVD by intervening TMAO in the future."

    "abstract": "Cancer is a complex set of diseases, and many have decades-long lag times between possible exposure and diagnosis. Environmental exposures, such as per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and area-level risk factors (e.g., socioeconomic variables), vary for people over time and space. Evidence suggests PFAS exposure is associated with several cancers; however, studies to date have various limitations. Few studies have used rigorous spatiotemporal approaches, and, to our knowledge, none have assessed cumulative exposures given residential histories or incorporated chemical mixture modeling. Thus, spatiotemporal analysis using advanced statistical approaches, accounting for spatially structured and unstructured heterogeneity in risk, can be a highly informative strategy for addressing the potential health effects of PFAS exposure. Using population-based incident cancer cases and cancer-free controls in a 12-county area of southeastern Pennsylvania, we will apply Bayesian spatiotemporal analysis methods using historically reconstructed PFAS-contaminated water exposure given residential histories, and other potential cancer determinants over time. Bayesian group index models enable assessment of various mixtures of highly correlated PFAS chemical exposures incorporating mobility/residential history, and contextual factors to determine the association of PFAS-related exposures and cancer incidence. The purpose of this paper is to describe the Enhanced PFAS Spatial Analysis study rationale, study design, and methods."

    "abstract": "Small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the urinary tract (SCNEC-URO) has an inferior prognosis compared to conventional urothelial carcinoma (UC). Here, we evaluate the predictors and patterns of relapse after surgery. We identified a definitive-surgery cohort (n = 224) from an institutional database of patients with cT1-T4NxM0 SCNEC-URO treated in 1985-2021. Histopathologic review was conducted by independent pathologists. Relapse event was the time-to-event outcome, and relapse probabilities were estimated using a competing risk method with cumulative incidence functions (CIFs). Fine-Gray distribution models assessed covariate associations. Most patients (161, 71.9%) received neoadjuvant chemotherapy (neoCTX). Ninety two (41%) patients had relapse with 77 (83.7%) having distant organs as first metastatic sites, including 10 (10.9%) with exclusive central nervous system (CNS) metastases, mostly (9/10) within 1 year of surgery. Patients with pathologic complete response (pCR) after neoCTx had the lowest 5-year CIF (16.5% [95% CI 9.3%-25.6%]). Patients with remaining exclusively small cell (SC) histology had the highest CIF (85.7% [95% CI 46.6-96.9]). Patients with eradicated SCNEC but remaining UC components had an intermediate-risk CIF (32.5% [95% CI 18.6-47.2]). Multivariable analysis adjusting for neoCTx, clinical stage at diagnosis (T3/4, N0/N+ vs. T1/T2, N0), and pathologic stage (pN+ vs. pN0) demonstrated that any SCNEC histology at resection (vs. pCR) was associated with relapse risk (hazard ratio = 3.69 [95% CI 1.91-7.13], p = 0.0001). SCNEC-URO is a systemic disease with high risk of distant relapse including CNS. Our findings highlight unmet needs for neoadjuvant/adjuvant approaches targeting the rare SCNEC subtype and suggest adding CNS surveillance within the first year after definitive surgery to high-risk patients. PRÃCIS (CONDENSED ABSTRACT): Alongside neoadjuvant chemotherapy and cancer stage, histology at resection strongly impacts relapse risk in small cell neuroendocrine carcinomas of the urinary tract. The incidence of brain metastasis is notably higher than in \"traditional\" urothelial cancer within the first year after surgery, especially if small cell cancer persists, thus necessitating close neurological monitoring during this period."

    "abstract": "Pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) may occasionally be indicated for complete removal of periampullary (duodenal and ampullary) adenomas (PAs). As compared with malignant indications, PD for benign or premalignant disease is often associated with increased morbidity. Although the Spigelman classification assesses malignancy risk for familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP)-related duodenal adenomas, no malignancy risk score (MRS) exists for non-FAP-related PAs. We developed an MRS for non-FAP-related PAs undergoing PD to weigh the risk of malignancy and postoperative morbidity. We retrospectively analyzed patients with non-FAP-related PA who underwent PD at 8 institutions (2010 to 2022). Patient and lesion factors associated with final malignant pathology were identified using multivariable logistic regression to create MRS. Postoperative complications were assessed according to MRS. Of 127 patients, 59 (46.5%) had evidence of malignancy on final pathology. The odds of malignancy were higher in patients aged 65 years or older (odds ratio [OR] 3.2, p = 0.01), having bile duct 9 mm or more (OR 3.3, p = 0.009), having preoperative symptoms (OR 7.7, p = 0.002), and having high-grade dysplasia (OR 7.5, p < 0.001). A MRS was derived ranging from 0 to 6: age 65 years or older = 1, bile duct 9 mm or more = 1, symptomatic = 2, and high-grade dysplasia = 2. Patients were stratified into low-risk (MRS 1 to 2, n = 26), intermediate-risk (MRS 3 to 4, n = 59), and high-risk groups (MRS 5 to 6, n = 26), with malignancy rates increasing with MRS (10.3%, 44.1%, and 88.2%, p < 0.001). Patients in the no- or low-risk group (MRS 0 to 2) had higher odds of major postoperative complications compared with patients in the intermediate- or high-risk group (MRS 3 or higher, OR 2.9, p = 0.047). This novel MRS stratifies the risk of malignancy in non-FAP-related PAs managed with PD. This score can be used to counsel patients who may require PD for complete tumor removal about their risk of harboring malignancy and their risk of major postoperative complications."

    "abstract": "SjÃ¶gren disease (SjD) is a systemic autoimmune disorder affecting both children and adults, with a wide range of clinical phenotypes. It remains a challenging condition to recognise and diagnose early and manage effectively. The heterogeneous nature of the presentation, variable disease course and overlapping symptoms with other autoimmune conditions often result in delayed diagnosis. This, coupled with the lack of licensed effective therapies frequently leads to suboptimal patient outcomes. Improved outcome measures are crucial for advancing our understanding of SjD pathogenesis and developing effective treatments. They can help ensure that clinical trials are accurately capturing the impact of potential therapies on the disease and the quality of life of people with SjD. Further developments are needed in the areas of age and developmentally appropriate disease and patient-reported outcome measures, with adequate sensitivity to evaluate treatment efficacy, as well as predictor biomarkers for both treatment response and poor prognostic outcomes associated with SjD. Advancing these areas will help ensure that clinical trials adequately select the most suitable SjD cohorts to treat with a certain therapy, as well as accurately reflect the impact of a certain intervention on disease activity, progression, and quality of life, ultimately leading to better care for people with SjD."

    "abstract": "Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) is one of the most common diseases observed in dairy calves in both the pre- and postweaning periods. Despite its common occurrence, no formal synthesis (e.g., scoping review) of the scientific literature has been conducted surrounding diagnosing BRD in dairy calves. As such, the objective of this scoping review was to describe what case definitions for diagnosing BRD in dairy calves have been used in research. An initial search of peer-reviewed journals and the gray literature yielded 12,001 unique articles, of which 307 records containing 358 case definitions were included. Seven categories of diagnostic methods were used to categorize case definitions: clinical scoring systems alone were the most used diagnostic method (n = 148, 41%); followed by physical exam parameters alone (i.e., the study did not provide a detailed description of how the calf was assessed for each component of the physical exam [i.e., no description or scoring options reported]), n = 91, 25%); physical exam parameters in combination with other diagnostic methods (n = 40, 11%); thoracic ultrasound alone (n = 31, 9%); clinical scoring system in combination with other diagnostic methods (n = 23, 7%); clinical scoring system in combination with thoracic ultrasound (n = 10, 3%); and other diagnostic methods (n = 15, 4%). Only two-thirds of publications provided a citation for their case definition (n = 230, 64%), of which the Wisconsin clinical scoring system was most referenced (n = 100, 43%), followed by the California clinical scoring system (n = 19, 8%). An attempt was made to compare entire case definitions within each diagnostic method; however, they displayed substantial diversity, which limited the ability to compare them at this level. Instead, counts of individual factors within each case definition (e.g., individual clinical signs) were reported for each diagnostic method. From all case definitions across the 7 diagnostic method categories (n = 358), common factors assessed included cough (n = 224, 63%), nasal discharge (n = 213, 60%), and body temperature (n = 142, 54%). Across all case definitions, additional parameters such as validity were frequently not reported; only 4 (1.1%) were referred to as validated, 9 (2.5%) were being validated in the study, and 28 (7.8%) modified existing case definitions. Additionally, assessment of severity of disease when present (e.g., mild, moderate or severe) was frequently not reported (n = 336, 93.9%). Further, 106 (29.0%) reported assessments of accuracy, 66 (18.4%) of which were reports of qualitative oversight (e.g., training of assessors), and 40 (11.1%) of which were related to a quantitative assessment of accuracy (e.g., sensitivity and specificity). Parameters surrounding conducting the assessment were also extracted, for example how often it was conducted (most common: at least daily, n = 120, 33.5%) and who conducted it (most common: information not reported, n = 144, 40.2%). The findings of this scoping review highlighted the need for a validated, standardized set of criteria for BRD diagnosis in dairy calves, achievable through following the methodology of developing a core outcome set."

Autosomal recessive PKD (ARPKD) is a rare form of PKD, caused by mutations in PKHD1, and clinically more severe than the more common autosomal dominant PKD (ADPKD). Prior studies have implicated Hedgehog (Hh) signaling in ADPKD, with increased levels of Hh components in experimental ADPKD and reduced cystogenesis following pharmacological Hh inhibition. In contrast, the role of the Hh pathway in ARPKD is poorly understood. We hypothesized that Hh pathway activity would be elevated during ARPKD pathogenesis, and its modulation may slow disease progression. We utilized Cpk mice which phenocopy ARPKD and generated a PKHD1-mutant spheroid model in human collecting ducts. Significantly elevated levels of the Hh transcriptional effector Gli3 were found in Cpk mice, a finding replicated in PKHD1-mutant spheroids. In Cpk mice, total GLI3 and GLI3 repressor protein levels were also increased. Reduction of increased Gli3 levels via heterozygous genetic deletion in Cpk mice did not affect cyst formation. Additionally, lowering GLI3 transcripts to wildtype levels did not influence PKHD1-mutant spheroid size. Collectively, these data suggest attenuation of elevated Gli3 does not modulate murine and human models of ARPKD."

    "title": "Prior nonarthroplasty shoulder surgery and modifiable risk factors negatively affect patient outcomes after shoulder arthroplasty.",
    "abstract": "Total shoulder arthroplasty frequently is performed in patients with a history of shoulder surgery. The purpose of this study was to evaluate clinical outcomes after primary shoulder arthroplasty in patients with a history of nonarthroplasty shoulder surgery, and whether certain modifiable risk factors (MRFs) were negatively associated with final outcome measures. The secondary purpose was to determine if costs or complications were higher in patients with prior shoulder surgery. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all patients who underwent primary shoulder arthroplasty from January 2015 to December 2019 by one surgeon at one institution. Patients who received hemiarthroplasty were excluded. Univariate analysis was performed to assess the influence of prior shoulder surgery on costs, complications, and patient-reported outcome measures. Multivariable analysis was performed to determine if MRF negatively affected results, defined as anemia, malnutrition, obesity, uncontrolled diabetes, tobacco use, and opioid use. 512 patients met inclusion criteria; 139 patients had at least one prior shoulder surgery. Patients with history of prior shoulder surgery were younger (65.2 Â± 9.3 years vs. 70.7 Â± 9.1 years, <i>P</i> < .001), more likely to be male (52.2% vs. 47.8%, <i>P</i> = .016), more likely to have smoking history (20.1% vs. 10.5%, <i>P</i> = .002), and borderline more likely to use preoperative opioids (47.5% vs. 38.9%, <i>P</i> = .078) while reporting significantly higher pain scores at final follow-up (visual analog scale for pain 1.7 Â± 2.4 vs. 1.1 Â± 1.9, <i>P</i> = .001) and lower patient-reported outcome measure (<i>P</i> â¤ .017 for all). The final American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score (ASES) score was independently negatively impacted by a history of prior surgery (<i>Î²</i> = -4.25 (-7.92, -0.56), <i>P</i> = .024) and other nonmodifiable factors including prosthesis type of reverse arthroplasty (<i>Î²</i> = -6.31, confidence interval [CI] -10.02, -2.60, <i>P</i> = .001), cardiac disease (<i>Î²</i> = -3.59, CI -7.12, -.0.07, <i>P</i> = .046), and any complication (<i>Î²</i> = 0.28, CI 0.19, 0.36, <i>P</i> < .001). The final ASES score was negatively impacted by MRF including opioid use (<i>Î²</i> = -4.08, CI: -7.32, -0.84, <i>P</i> < .001) and smoking status (<i>Î²</i> = -7.59, CI: -12.69, -2.49, <i>P</i> < .001). Males had slightly higher final ASES scores (<i>Î²</i> = 3.79, CI 0.46, 7.11, <i>P</i> = .026). Patients with prior surgery were more likely to have an intraoperative stress fracture [odds ratio [OR] 4.6 (1.1, 19.5), <i>P</i> = .038] and borderline more likely to have neurologic complication [OR 1.7 (1.0, 3.0), <i>P</i> = .062] or any complication [OR 1.5 (1.0, 2.3), <i>P</i> = .075]. Patients with prior shoulder surgery were younger, more likely to be male, and more likely to have a history of tobacco use and opioid use. These patients experienced worse subjective clinical outcomes and were more likely to experience a complication."

We defined a CRE case as the first isolation of <i>Escherichia coli</i>, <i>Enterobacter cloacae</i> complex, <i>Klebsiella aerogenes</i>, <i>K oxytoca</i>, <i>K pneumoniae</i>, or <i>K variicola</i> resistant to any carbapenem. We defined an ESBL-E case as the first isolation of <i>E coli</i>, <i>K pneumoniae</i>, or <i>K oxytoca</i> resistant to any third-generation cephalosporin and nonresistant to all carbapenems tested. Specimens were drawn from a normally sterile site or urine among hospitalized residents of the surveillance area in a 30-day period. We defined COVID-19 as a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result (SC2<sup>+</sup>) within 14 days before CRE or ESBL-E specimen collection and performed multivariable logistic regression analyses. Of 1595 CRE and 1866 ESBL-E hospitalized cases, 38 (2.4%) and 60 (3.2%), respectively, had a SC2<sup>+</sup>. Among these cases, a SC2<sup>+</sup> was associated with intensive care unit admission (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.69 [95% CI, 1.14-2.50]; aOR, 1.48 [95% CI, 1.03-2.12]) and 30-day mortality (aOR, 1.79 [95% CI, 1.22-2.64]; aOR, 1.94 [95% CI, 1.39-2.70]). CRE and ESBL-E infections among hospitalized patients with preceding COVID-19 were uncommon but had worse outcomes when compared with cases without COVID-19. COVID-19 prevention in patients at risk of CRE and ESBL-E infections is needed, as well as continued infection control measures and antibiotic stewardship for patients with COVID-19."

    "abstract": "Plasma biomarkers (kidney injury molecule-1, KIM-1), urine biomarkers (EGF/creatinine and urine albumin-creatinine ratio), and eGFR identified four prognostic groups in children with CKD progression. A panel of biomarkers may better capture the complexity of kidney disease in children and may allow for a broader assessment of kidney health. We have previously studied biomarkers of tubular health (EGF), injury (kidney injury molecule-1 [KIM-1]), dysfunction (<i>Î±</i>-1 microglobulin), and inflammation (TNF receptor-1, TNF receptor-2, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, YKL-40, and soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor) and demonstrated that plasma KIM-1, TNF receptor-1, TNF receptor-2, urine KIM-1, EGF, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and urine <i>Î±</i>-1 microglobulin are each independently associated with CKD progression in children. In this study, we used bootstrapped survival trees to identify a combination of biomarkers to predict CKD progression in children. The Chronic Kidney Disease in Children (CKiD) Cohort Study prospectively enrolled children aged 6 months to 16 years with an eGFR of 30â90 ml/min per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>. We measured biomarkers in stored plasma and urine collected 5 months after study enrollment. The primary outcome of CKD progression was a composite of 50% eGFR decline or kidney failure. We constructed a regression treeâbased model for predicting the time to the composite event, using a panel of clinically relevant biomarkers with empirically derived thresholds, in addition to conventional risk factors. Of the 599 children included, the median age was 12 years (interquartile range [IQR], 8â15), 371 (62%) were male, baseline urine protein-creatinine ratio was 0.33 (IQR, 0.12â0.95) mg/mg, and baseline eGFR was 53 (IQR, 40â66) ml/min per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>. Overall, 205 children (34%) reached the primary outcome of CKD progression. A single regression treeâbased model using the most informative predictors with data-driven biomarker thresholds suggested a final set of four prognosis groups. In the final model, urine albumin/creatinine was the variable with the highest importance and along with urine EGF/creatinine identified the highest risk group of 24 children, 100% of whom developed CKD progression at a median time of 1.3 years (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.0 to 1.7). When the regression treeâderived risk group classifications were added to prediction models including the clinical risk factors, the C-statistic increased from 0.76 (95% CI, 0.71 to 0.80) to 0.85 (95% CI, 0.81 to 0.88). Using regression treeâbased methods, we identified a biomarker panel of urine albumin/creatinine, urine EGF/creatinine, plasma KIM-1, and eGFR, which significantly improved discrimination for CKD progression."

    "abstract": "Individuals with co-occurring posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and HIV are at high-risk for negative HIV-related outcomes, including low adherence to antiretroviral therapy, faster disease progression, more hospitalizations, and almost twice the rate of death. Despite high rates of PTSD in persons with HIV (PWH) and poor HIV-related health outcomes associated with PTSD, an effective evidence-based treatment for PTSD symptoms in PWH does not exist. This study aimed to describe the adaptation and theater testing of an evidence-based intervention designed for people with co-occurring PTSD and HIV. The Assessment, Decision, Adaptation, Production, Topical experts-integration, Training, and Testing (ADAPT-ITT) framework guided the formative process used to modify an evidence-based PTSD treatment (cognitive processing therapy; CPT) to meet the unique needs of PWH experiencing PTSD. With the integration of Life-Steps for Medication Adherence (Life-Steps), the adapted protocol (CPT-Life-Steps for integration of adherence; CPT-L) targeted HIV-related stigma and HIV medication adherence within a trauma-informed framework. Theater testing was completed with 7 participants to evaluate acceptability of CPT-L for PWH. The qualitative data (N=54 recordings) used to evaluate and adapt CPT-L emerged from individual interviews conducted with participants after each therapy session as well as exit interviews conducted at posttreatment data collection. After challenging stigma-related appraisals, participants expressed feeling less constrained by maladaptive thoughts. These shifts translated to increased self-efficacy with both HIV-related care and mental health. These results indicate that trauma-informed work with PWH should consider the impact of HIV on trauma-related stuck points, intersecting identities (including living with HIV), and challenging internalized stigma. Findings provide evidence that CPT-L is acceptable and effective in addressing internalized HIV stigma that impacts PTSD symptom maintenance and HIV treatment engagement.

    "abstract": "Metabolomics provides powerful tools that can inform about heterogeneity in disease and response to treatments. In this exploratory study, we employed an electrochemistry-based targeted metabolomics platform to assess the metabolic effects of three randomly-assigned treatments: escitalopram, duloxetine, and Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) in 163 treatment-naÃ¯ve outpatients with major depressive disorder. Serum samples from baseline and 12 weeks post-treatment were analyzed using targeted liquid chromatography-electrochemistry for metabolites related to tryptophan, tyrosine metabolism and related pathways. Changes in metabolite concentrations related to each treatment arm were identified and compared to define metabolic signatures of exposure. In addition, association between metabolites and depressive symptom severity (assessed with the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression [HRSD<sub>17</sub>]) and anxiety symptom severity (assessed with the 14-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety [HRSA<sub>14</sub>]) were evaluated, both at baseline and after 12 weeks of treatment. Significant reductions in serum serotonin level and increases in tryptophan-derived indoles that are gut bacterially derived were observed with escitalopram and duloxetine arms but not in CBT arm. These include indole-3-propionic acid (I3PA), indole-3-lactic acid (I3LA) and Indoxyl sulfate (IS), a uremic toxin. Purine-related metabolites were decreased across all arms. Different metabolites correlated with improved symptoms in the different treatment arms revealing potentially different mechanisms between response to antidepressant medications and to CBT."

    "abstract": "Asthma-COPD overlap (ACO) is characterized by patients exhibiting features of both asthma and COPD. Currently, there is no specific treatment for ACO. This study aimed to investigate the therapeutic potential of targeting CD131, a shared receptor subunit for IL-3, IL-5 and GM-CSF, in ACO development and in preventing acute viral exacerbations. A two-hit mouse model of ACO was established by house dust mite (HDM) allergen sensitization to model asthma, and elastase treatment to model emphysema. In a separate model, human rhinovirus 1b (RV1b) was used to induce an acute asthma exacerbation. A neutralizing antibody against CD131 was used to block CD131 in vivo signalling. Mice exposed to HDM and elastase developed cardinal features for asthma and COPD, including airway hyperreactivity (AHR) and emphysema. A mixed granulocytic inflammatory profile was identified in the lungs, including expansion of monocyte-derived macrophages, neutrophils and eosinophils. RT-qPCR analysis detected heightened gene expression of Mmp12, Il5 and Il13. Transcriptomic analysis further revealed pathway enrichment for type 2 inflammation and macrophage activation. Blockade of CD131 effectively reduced the lung inflammation and prevented the development of AHR, airway fibrosis and emphysema. Interestingly, pathway enrichment for Th1 response and interferon production detected in the model was not affected by the treatment. Consistently, CD131 antagonism prevented RV1b-induced asthma exacerbation without compromising RV1b clearance. CD131 signalling coordinates multiple pathological pathways that drive airway inflammation and lung remodelling in ACO. Hence, CD131 antagonism represents a novel approach to combating the immunopathology in the complex ACO setting."

    "abstract": "There have been conflicting reports about the frequency of neural autoantibodies in epilepsy cohorts, which is confounded by the lack of clear distinction of epilepsy from acute symptomatic seizures due to encephalitis. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of neural autoantibodies in a well characterised population of refractory focal epilepsy of known and unknown cause. Cases were recruited from epilepsy outpatient clinics at the Princess Alexandra, Mater, Royal Brisbane and Women's and Cairns Base Hospitals from 2021 - 2023. Included cases were refractory to medical therapy, met the ILAE definition of focal epilepsy and were characterised using anatomo-electro-clinical correlation. Cases with prior encephalitis, inflammatory neurological disease or prior parenchymal brain insults were excluded. A total of 100 patients were recruited. No cases with clinically significant neural autoantibodies were discovered. One was positive for serum anti-NMDAR antibodies, however autoantibodies were absent from CSF. Cases were also screened using a predictive score (McGinty et al.). From this, 2 cases were identified as seronegative autoimmune associated epilepsy and demonstrated significant reduction in seizure frequency with administration of immunotherapy. These cases had common features including temporo-perisylvian semiology especially ictal piloerection and high seizure frequency. Clinically relevant neural autoantibodies are uncommon in well characterised chronic focal epilepsy populations. Despite this there are isolated cases that still demonstrate improved seizure control with the use of immunotherapy. Such cases highlight the need for further studies to understand the role of immunity in novel pathophysiological mechanisms in epilepsy."

    "abstract": "Neonatal encephalopathy (NE) is characterized by an abnormal level of consciousness with or without seizures in the neonatal period. It affects 1-6/1,000 live term newborns. We applied genome sequencing (GS) in term newborns with NE to investigate the underlying genetic causes. We enrolled term newborns according to inclusion/exclusion criteria during their Neonatal Intensive Care admission. We performed GS trio and applied bioinformatic tools. We developed pipelines for manual filters. We applied in silico prediction tools, protein 3D modeling, and functional characterization to assess the pathogenicity of variants. Seventeen newborns fulfilled inclusion criteria. We identified 12 variants in 10 genes. We classified 4 variants in <i>PPP2R5D</i>, <i>BCOR</i>, <i>CFL2</i>, and <i>SCN2A</i> (previously established disease genes) as pathogenic/likely pathogenic; 7 variants in <i>DST</i> (previously established disease gene), <i>STAB2</i>, <i>CELF4</i>, <i>SORCS2</i>, <i>CTNND2</i>, and <i>ASTN1</i> (5 candidate genes) as variants of uncertain significance (VUS); and one variant in <i>STAB2</i> as likely benign. The <i>CELF4</i> and <i>ASTN1</i> copy number variants (CNVs) resulted in structural changes in protein 3D models. The functional characterization of <i>SORCS2</i> VUS revealed disruption of SorCS2 dimer formation and confirmed its pathogenicity. The functional characterization of <i>STAB2</i> variants updated their characterization from VUS/likely benign to benign. The <i>CTNND2</i> VUS resulted in a shift in 3D protein structure. We were not able to perform protein 3D modeling and functional characterization of two <i>DST</i> VUS. We are not certain whether <i>CTNND2</i> and <i>DST</i> variants may be causative of NE in our study. The diagnostic rate of research GS was 41% in our prospective study. We broaden the phenotypic spectrum of <i>PPP2R5D</i>-associated Hogue-Janssens syndrome 1, <i>CFL2</i>-associated nemaline myopathy 7, and <i>BCOR</i>-associated oculo-facio-cardio-dental syndrome to include NE and/or neonatal seizures. We identified 3 candidate genes (<i>SORCS2, CELF4, ASTN1</i>) that may cause NE. We believe that protein 3D modeling is an important tool to assess the pathogenicity of CNVs and may advance the discoveries of novel genetic diseases. However, functional characterization of missense variants is essential for discoveries of novel genetic diseases. It seems that GS can help identify more candidate genes compared with ES."

    "abstract": "Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is a slowly progressive neurological disease resulting from decreased levels of the protein frataxin, a small mitochondrial protein that facilitates the synthesis of iron-sulfur clusters in the mitochondrion. It is caused by GAA (guanine-adenine-adenine) repeat expansions in the <i>FXN</i> gene in 96% of patients, with 4% of patients carrying other mutations (missense, nonsense, deletion) in the <i>FXN</i> gene. Compound heterozygote patients with one expanded GAA allele and a non-GAA repeat mutation can have subtle differences in phenotype from typical FRDA, including, in patients with selected missense mutations, both more severe features and less severe features in the same patient. In this review, we propose explanations for such phenotypes based on the potential for activities of frataxin other than enhancement of iron-sulfur cluster synthesis, as well as crucial future experiments for fully understanding the role of frataxin in cells."

    "abstract": "Porto-sinusoidal vascular disorder (PSVD) is a rare vascular liver disorder characterised by specific histological findings in the absence of cirrhosis, which is poorly understood in terms of pathophysiology. While elevated hepatic copper content serves as diagnostic hallmark in Wilson disease (WD), hepatic copper content has not yet been investigated in PSVD. Patients with a verified diagnosis of PSVD at the Medical University of Vienna and available hepatic copper content at the time of diagnosis of PSVD were retrospectively included. Elevated hepatic copper content was correlated with cholestatic changes and WD diagnostics in PSVD and analysed for liver-related outcomes (first/further hepatic decompensation/liver-related death). Overall, 92 patients were included into this study (mean age 49 Â± 16; 57% male; median hepatic copper content was 30 [IQR: 18-55] Î¼g/g) of whom 29 (32%) had moderately (â¥ 50 Î¼g/g) and 4 (4%) strongly (â¥ 250 Î¼g/g) elevated hepatic copper content. Elevated levels of hepatic copper were associated with younger age in multivariable linear regression analysis. After adjusting for age, decompensation status and albumin, hepatic copper content was significantly associated with the outcome of interest (log, per 10; aHR: 1.60 [95% CI: 1.14-2.25]; p = 0.007). A hepatic copper cut-off at â¥ 90 Î¼g/g identified PSVD patients with considerable risk of liver-related outcomes (at 2 years: 51% vs. 12%). Elevated hepatic copper seems frequent in patients with PSVD even in the absence of cholestatic features, especially in young patients, which makes differential diagnosis to WD challenging. Since PSVD patients with elevated hepatic copper content had increased risk for liver-related outcomes, the pathomechanisms underlying hepatic copper accumulation in PSVD should be investigated as this may open new therapeutic avenues."

    "abstract": "To describe the epidemiology, patient characteristics and comorbidities in patients with Wilson disease (WD) in the USA. Retrospective, population-based study. The study used the US Komodo claims database containing records regarding medical claims for over 120 million individuals. Patients with WD were identified via ICD-10 (10th revision of the International Classification of Diseases) code during the study period 2016-2019 and no age restriction was applied. A further stratification by disease subtype ('hepatic', 'neurologic' and 'psychiatric') was performed. WD prevalence was reported by age, sex and US census regions/divisions. Adjusted prevalence was calculated using age-specific prevalence standardised to the USA (2010 US census) and to the world (WHO 2000-2025) to enable comparisons across countries, using direct standardisation of prevalence estimates by age group. Overall, 2115 patients with WD were identified during the study period. Among them, 56.8% had hepatic symptoms, 57.0% neurologic symptoms and 47.4% psychiatric symptoms. The most frequent manifestations in hepatic patients were liver signs and symptoms (90.8%), in neurologic patients cognitive defects (50.7%) and in psychiatric patients mood disorders (86.4%). The mean age in the overall cohort was 39.9 years. Prevalence estimation was based on 1481 patients with WD between 2017 and 2019. The 2017-2019 crude period prevalence was 21.2 patients per million (95% CI: 20.1 to 22.3), with similar prevalence observed for both sexes. This study provides important real-world data on the diagnosed prevalence of WD in the USA and revealed the comorbidities associated with various disease subtypes, thereby providing a comprehensive basis for guiding physicians and policy makers in the management of this chronic disease."

In this study, we used the International Atomic Energy Agency Doubly Labeled Water Database to derive a predictive equation for TEE using 6,497 measures of TEE in individuals aged 4 to 96 years. The resultant regression equation predicts expected TEE from easily acquired variables, such as body weight, age and sex, with 95% predictive limits that can be used to screen for misreporting by participants in dietary studies. We applied the equation to two large datasets (National Diet and Nutrition Survey and National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) and found that the level of misreporting was >50%. The macronutrient composition from dietary reports in these studies was systematically biased as the level of misreporting increased, leading to potentially spurious associations between diet components and body mass index."

Cases of HDP (143) and controls (169) from mother-baby dyads were recruited at the Los Angeles County Women's and Children's Hospital (WCH). Cases of severe disease (99) and controls (31) from mother-father-baby triads were recruited through HELLP syndrome websites. Four sFLT-1 SNPs (rs7993594, rs3751395, rs7983774, and rs664393) were genotyped. Data was analyzed using a log-linear regression model in the Haplin package in R. Maternal double dose of the A allele (rs7993594) exhibited a nominally significant increased risk of HDP (RR = 3.52, 95% CI 1.08, 11.20). In the severe-spectrum cohort, a marginally significant protective effect among mothers carrying infants with a single dose of the A allele (rs7993594) was observed (RR = 0.59, 95% CI 0.36, 0.98) and double-dose maternal carriage of the G-t-G-G haplotype increased risk of severe disease (RR = 4.13, 95% CI 1.22, 13.80). The maternal rs7993594 A allele appears to be associated with increased risk of HDP. Double-dose maternal carriage of the G-t-G-G haplotype increased risk of severe disease whereas the fetal rs7983774 A allele appears to be associated with decreased risk."

    "abstract": "Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) detection can predict clinical risk in early-stage tumors. However, clinical applications are constrained by the sensitivity of clinically validated ctDNA detection approaches. NeXT Personal is a whole-genome-based, tumor-informed platform that has been analytically validated for ultrasensitive ctDNA detection at 1-3 ppm of ctDNA with 99.9% specificity. Through an analysis of 171 patients with early-stage lung cancer from the TRACERx study, we detected ctDNA pre-operatively within 81% of patients with lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), including 53% of those with pathological TNM (pTNM) stage I disease. ctDNA predicted worse clinical outcome, and patients with LUAD with <80 ppm preoperative ctDNA levels (the 95% limit of detection of a ctDNA detection approach previously published in TRACERx) experienced reduced overall survival compared with ctDNA-negative patients with LUAD. Although prospective studies are needed to confirm the clinical utility of the assay, these data show that our approach has the potential to improve disease stratification in early-stage LUADs."

    "abstract": "The structure and function of the mammalian gut vary by region, yet why inflammatory diseases manifest in specific regions and not others remains unclear. We use a TNF-overexpressing Crohn's disease (CD) model (Tnf<sup>ÎARE/+</sup>), which typically presents in the terminal ileum (TI), to investigate how environmental factors interact with the host's immune susceptibility to drive region-specific disease. We identified <i>Chlamydia muridarum,</i> an intracellular bacterium and murine counterpart to the human sexually transmitted <i>C. trachomatis</i>, as necessary and sufficient to trigger disease manifestation in the ascending colon (AC), another common site of human CD. Disease manifestation in the AC depends on indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO1) activity induced by hypersensitive surface secretory cells in genetically susceptible hosts. Single-cell and microbial analyses of human specimens also implicates this pathobiont-epithelial IDO1 pathway in patients with a history of CD in the AC. Our findings demonstrate that genetic and microbial factors can independently drive region-specific disease and provide a unique model to study CD specific to the AC."

Healthy MASLD patients are frequently overlooked and maltreated, especially in Bangladesh. In this present study, we tried to correlate T2DM burden in apparently healthy, incidentally diagnosed fatty liver patients on ultrasound. This cross-sectional study was done in Sheikh Hasina Medical College Hospital, Tangail, Bangladesh, from August 2022 to February 2023. A total of 92 patients with ultrasonological evidence of grade II fatty change in the liver were included and evaluated. Known T2DM, hypothyroidism, consumption of alcohol, HBV or HCV infection, Wilson's disease, autoimmune liver disease, hemochromatosis, and any other chronic liver or kidney disease patients were excluded. The patients were then assessed for the presence and absence of T2DM using OGTT (2 hours 75 gm glucose â¥ 11.1 mmol/L) and/or HbA1c (â¥6.5%) as diagnostic criteria. Data was analyzed by SPSS, version 23. Out of 92 patients, 48 were male and 44 were female. A total of 50 patients (54.3%) were newly diagnosed with T2DM. Statistically significant differences were seen in the T2DM group and non-DM group for AST (50.33 IU vs 36.53 IU) and TG (270 mg/dL vs 189 mg/dL). Although no noteworthy differences were evident in mean age (41 years vs 38 years), ALT (58.9 IU vs 60.23 IU), and BMI (28.85 vs 29.29). In the present study, more than 54% of patients with grade II fatty liver were newly diagnosed with T2DM. They would later present with more advanced T2DM and related complications. Although a larger study is needed, physicians and healthcare workers in Bangladesh should be more concerned about treating MASLD patients with early diagnosis of T2DM, recommending prompt lifestyle interventions, and prescribing drugs if necessary.

    "abstract": "Strong sex differences exist in sleep phenotypes and also cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). However, sex-specific causal effects of sleep phenotypes on CVD-related outcomes have not been thoroughly examined. Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis is a useful approach for estimating the causal effect of a risk factor on an outcome of interest when interventional studies are not available. We first conducted sex-specific genome-wide association studies (GWASs) for suboptimal-sleep phenotypes (insomnia, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), short and long sleep durations, and excessive daytime sleepiness) utilizing the Million Veteran Program (MVP) dataset. We then developed a semi-empirical Bayesian framework that (i) calibrates variant-phenotype effect estimates by leveraging information across sex groups, and (ii) applies shrinkage sex-specific effect estimates in MR analysis, to alleviate weak instrumental bias when sex groups are analyzed in isolation. Simulation studies demonstrate that the causal effect estimates derived from our framework are substantially more efficient than those obtained through conventional methods. We estimated the causal effects of sleep phenotypes on CVD-related outcomes using sex-specific GWAS data from the MVP and All of Us. Significant sex differences in causal effects were observed, particularly between OSA and chronic kidney disease, as well as long sleep duration on several CVD-related outcomes. By applying shrinkage estimates for instrumental variable selection, we identified multiple sex-specific significant causal relationships between OSA and CVD-related phenotypes."

Titanium and polyetheretherketone (PEEK) are popular materials for interbody implants although evidence is mixed on which material is superior in terms of fusion and subsidence. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical outcome of 3D printed titanium (3DPT) cages in patients undergoing TLIFs, as well as complication profiles based on widely used outcome metrics and reoperation events. A retrospective review was conducted for patients receiving 1- or 2-level TLIF at an academic medical center between January 2018 and May 2022. Patients were divided into two cohorts according to the material of interbody cage(s), either 3DPT banana or titanium-coated PEEK bullet. Radiographs, patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), and complications were analyzed and compared. All included patients had radiographic and clinical follow-up of at least one year. 200 patients with 277 interbody cage-implanted levels were included. Patients received either 3DPT (n = 140) or PEEK (n = 60) interbody cages with 202 and 75 instrumented vertebral levels per cohort, respectively. At one year, the 3DPT cohort demonstrated a higher fusion rate of 93.3 % compared to the PEEK cohort's fusion rate of 73.2 % (p < 0.0001). Subsidence rates were 6.0 % and 25.0 % for the 3DPT and PEEK groups, respectively (p < 0.0001). While 3DPT and PEEK interbody cages demonstrated few adverse events at short- and long-term follow-up, 3DPT exhibited a higher rate of fusion and lower rate of subsidence at one year."

    "abstract": "Procalcitonin is a rapid response biomarker specific for bacterial infection, which is not routinely used in the UK National Health Service. We aimed to assess whether using a procalcitonin-guided algorithm would safely reduce the duration of antibiotic therapy compared with usual care, in which C-reactive protein is the commonly used biomarker. The BATCH trial was a pragmatic, multicentre, open-label, parallel, two-arm, individually randomised, controlled trial conducted in 15 hospitals in England and Wales. Children aged 72 h to 18 years who were admitted to hospital and were being treated with intravenous antibiotics for suspected or confirmed bacterial infection and who were expected to remain on intravenous antibiotics for more than 48 h were enrolled. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either current clinical management alone (usual care group) or clinical management with the addition of a procalcitonin test guided algorithm (procalcitonin group). Participants were randomly assigned by minimisation, with site and age group (0-6 months, 6 months to 2 years, 2-5 years, and older than 5 years) as minimisation factors and a random element to reduce predictability. Participants were randomly assigned remotely using a secure 24 h web-based randomisation programme. The coprimary outcomes were duration of intravenous antibiotic use, assessed for superiority, and a composite safety measure, assessed for non-inferiority (non-inferiority margin 5%). The primary analysis sample for each coprimary endpoint included all randomly assigned participants with available outcome data. This trial is registered with the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number registry, ISRCTN11369832. Between June 11, 2018, and Oct 12, 2022, 15 282 children were screened for eligibility, 1949 of whom were randomly assigned to receive procalcitonin-guided antibiotic therapy (n=977) or usual care (n=972). The median intravenous antibiotic duration was 96Â·0 h (IQR 59Â·5-155Â·5) in the procalcitonin group and 99Â·7 h (61Â·2-153Â·8) in the usual care group (hazard ratio 0Â·96 [95% CI 0Â·87-1Â·05]). 78 (9%) of 917 participants in the procalcitonin group and 85 (9%) of 904 participants in the usual care group had at least one event covered by the composite safety outcome measure (estimated adjusted risk difference -0Â·81% [95% CI upper bound 1Â·11]). In children with suspected or confirmed bacterial infection admitted to hospitals in England and Wales for intravenous antibiotic treatment of at least 48 h, the introduction of a procalcitonin-guided algorithm did not reduce duration of intravenous antibiotics treatment and is non-inferior to usual care for safety outcomes. Therefore, evidence does not support the use of procalcitonin-guided algorithms where robust effective paediatric antibiotic stewardship programmes are established.

To create and explore a novel patient-perceived burden of disease (PPBoD) score in a large Australasian cohort, and correlate PPBoD scores with demographics, disease and treatment factors. The Crohn Colitis Care Registry was interrogated in October 2023. Data from adults with IBD with an outpatient care encounter in the last 14 months among 17 centres were included. A novel PPBoD score was designed for ulcerative colitis (UC), Crohn disease (CD) and IBD-unclassified (IBDU). Correlations between PPBoD scores and demographics, disease and treatment factors were examined. Of those with adequate data, 46.7% (2653/5685) had no PPBoD, 34.6% (1969/5685) had mild, 11.3% (641/5685) had moderate and 7.4% (422/5685) had significant PPBoD. New Zealanders were more likely to have higher PPBoD compared to Australians (P = 0.047). Greater PPBoD was seen in patients with CD and IBDU compared to patients with UC (P < 0.001) and females were more likely to have significant PPBoD (8.7%) than males (6.1%) (P < 0.001). People with no or mild PPBoD were more likely to be on advanced therapies (55.7% and 59.5% respectively) than those with significant PPBoD (46.3%) (P < 0.001). The proportion of people on advanced therapies in Australia was higher than in New Zealand (61.2% vs 38.5% respectively, P < 0.001). Steroid usage was significantly higher in people with greater PPBoD (significant BoD 7.1% vs no BoD 1.1%; P < 0.001). Most of this real-world care cohort had no or mild PPBoD.

Structural equation model was used to analyze the data. The score of mindfulness of patients with WD was (128.63 Â± 22.62), and there were statistically significant differences in different courses of disease, clinical classification, and hospitalization times (P < 0.05). Perceived social support (Î² = 0.18, P < 0.01) and psychological resilience (Î² = 0.36, P < 0.05) directly affected mindfulness, perceived social support (Î² = 0.21, P < 0.01), and acceptance of illness (Î² = 0.11, P < 0.05) indirectly affected mindfulness through psychological resilience. Patients with WD have moderate levels of mindfulness, psychological resilience, perceived social support and acceptance of illness directly or indirectly affect their mindfulness. Nursing staff can help patients improve their mental defense ability, actively seek more social support, dialectical view, and accept the disease to improve their level of mindfulness to promote physical and mental health."

We aim to understand the host immunologic and microbial features of COVID-19 in transplant recipients by leveraging a prospective multicenter cohort of 86 transplant recipients age- and sex-matched with 172 non-transplant controls. We find that transplant recipients have higher nasal SARS-CoV-2 viral abundance and impaired viral clearance, and lower anti-spike IgG levels. In addition, transplant recipients exhibit decreased plasmablasts and transitional B cells, and increased senescent T cells. Blood and nasal transcriptional profiling demonstrate unexpected upregulation of innate immune signaling pathways and increased levels of several proinflammatory serum chemokines. Severe disease in transplant recipients, however, is characterized by a less robust induction of pro-inflammatory genes and chemokines. Together, our study reveals distinct immune features and altered viral dynamics in solid organ transplant recipients."

A retrospective, multi-institutional study was performed. Medical records were searched to identify dogs diagnosed with nasal planum SCC. Variables were recorded from medical records and statistically analyzed. 89 dogs were included. The most common presenting complaint was a visible mass on the nasal planum (89%). Metastasis was detected in 12% of dogs at the time of local therapy. Local therapy consisted of surgical excision alone in 63 of 89 dogs (71%) and radiation therapy alone in 20 of 89 dogs (22%); 6 dogs had multiple local therapies. Tumor size decreased in 12 dogs (60%) undergoing radiation therapy alone. Local recurrence was reported in 19 of 89 dogs (21%), including 16 of 63 dogs (25%) treated with surgery alone. Median survival time of all dogs was 452 days (95% CI, 285 to 576). Median survival time among 33 dogs with documented disease progression was 336 days (95% CI, 189 to 458), versus 685 days (95% CI, 334 to 1,042) in 56 dogs that did not have documented disease progression, which was significantly different (P = .038). Documented disease progression was significantly associated with hazard of death (hazard ratio, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.03 to 3.63; P = .041). Dogs undergoing local treatment of nasal planum SCC had a favorable prognosis. Metastasis at the time of treatment was uncommon. Long-term survival was possible, particularly in cases without disease progression. Aggressive local therapy, particularly surgical resection, should be considered in dogs with nasal planum SCC."

    "abstract": "Pregnancy complications pose challenges for both pregnant women and obstetricians globally, with the pathogenesis of many remaining poorly understood. Recently coined as a mode of cell death, cuproptosis has been proposed but remains largely unexplored. This process involves copper overload, resulting in the accumulation of fatty acylated proteins and subsequent loss of iron-sulfur cluster proteins. This cascade induces proteotoxic stress, leading to cell death. In recent years, studies have indicated a connection between abnormal copper metabolism and several pregnancy-related diseases, including maternal placental dysplasia, gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), gestational hypertension (PIH), preterm birth or abortion, as well as conditions in offspring such as intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), allergic disease, Menkes disease, and Wilson's disease. Investigating the mechanism of cuproptosis and abnormal copper metabolism in these pregnancy-related diseases emerges as a critical research area. This article provides a concise review of cuproptosis mechanisms and emphasizes the association between abnormal copper metabolism and pregnancy-related diseases. Nevertheless, the doubtful viewpoints were also discussed."

A targeted literature review was undertaken in July 2021 using Medline, Embase, online grey literature search engines, and stakeholder organization websites. Additionally, a stakeholder survey on meaningful change was fielded between March and June 2023. Both quantitative and qualitative methods were used to analyze responses and identify key themes. The literature review resulted in 86 references. These revealed different approaches to define, measure and validate meaningful change. There were 248 survey responses. Many respondents felt the terminology and methods for defining meaningful change are confusing. Respondents also emphasized the importance of distinguishing within-patient and between-group change, and defining meaningfulness from the patient perspective (most patients and caregivers do not share a similar definition of meaningfulness as their healthcare professionals). Four key recommendations for defining, establishing, and interpreting meaningful change estimates for COAs are: (1) Be clear on the type of \"meaningful change\" that is discussed or needed for a COA, (2) Ensure the \"patient voice\" is informing meaningful change estimates/definitions, (3) Acknowledge that a meaningful change estimate for a COA may differ between populations, diseases, and disease states, and (4) Disseminate data in a way that reduces ambiguity."

    "abstract": "Maternal obesity puts the offspring at high risk of developing obesity and cardiometabolic diseases in adulthood. Here, we utilized a mouse model of maternal high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity that recapitulates metabolic perturbations seen in humans. We show increased adiposity in the offspring of HFD-fed mothers (Off-HFD) when compared with the offspring of regular diet-fed mothers (Off-RD). We have previously reported significant immune perturbations in the bone marrow of newly weaned Off-HFD. Here, we hypothesized that lipid metabolism is altered in the bone marrow of Off-HFD versus Off-RD. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the lipidomic profile of bone marrow cells collected from 3-week-old Off-RD and Off-HFD. Diacylglycerols (DAGs), triacylglycerols (TAGs), sphingolipids, and phospholipids were remarkably different between the groups, independent of fetal sex. Levels of cholesteryl esters were significantly decreased in Off-HFD, suggesting reduced delivery of cholesterol. These were accompanied by age-dependent progression of mitochondrial dysfunction in bone marrow cells. We subsequently isolated CD11b+ myeloid cells from 3-wk-old mice and conducted metabolomic, lipidomic, and transcriptomic analyses. The lipidomic profiles of myeloid cells were similar to those of bone marrow cells and included increases in DAGs and decreased TAGs. Transcriptomics revealed altered expression of genes related to immune pathways, including macrophage alternative activation, B-cell receptors, and transforming growth factor-Î² signaling. All told, this study revealed lipidomic, metabolomic, and gene expression abnormalities in bone marrow cells broadly, and in bone marrow myeloid cells particularly, in the newly weaned offspring of mothers with obesity, which might at least partially explain the progression of metabolic and cardiovascular diseases in their adulthood.<b>NEW & NOTEWORTHY</b> Our data revealed significant immunometabolic perturbations in the bone marrow and myeloid cells in the newly weaned offspring born to mothers with obesity. Adaptation to an adverse maternal intrauterine environment affects bone marrow metabolism at a very young age and might affect responses to immune challenges that appear later in life, for example, infections or cancer."

Mettalothionein immunohistochemistry was performed in 1 case and showed strong positivity. The first child developed liver failure and died. The second child was started on oral penicillamine therapy and is alive on the most recent follow-up. Whole-exome studies of both patients showed no significant findings. None of the children had exposure to excess dietary copper. Sporadic cases of Indian childhood cirrhosis continue to occur.

Several factors were examined in optimizing the entrapment method, including the addition of a reducing agent to maintain a reduced active site cysteine residue in DJ-1, the concentration of DJ-1 employed, and the entrapment times. Isatin was used as a known binding agent (dissociation constant, â¼2.0 Î¼M) and probe for DJ-1 activity.

A total of 452 664 individuals with opioid exposure (including 33 669 with OUD) had a mean (SD) age of 61.15 (13.37) years, and 90.46% were male; the sample was ancestrally diverse (with individuals of genetically inferred European, African, and admixed American ancestries). Using Nagelkerke R2, collectively, the 15 candidate genes accounted for 0.40% of variation in OUD risk. In comparison, age and sex alone accounted for 3.27% of the variation. The ensemble machine learning. The ensemble machine learning model using the 15 variants as predictive factors correctly classified 52.83% (95% CI, 52.07%-53.59%) of individuals in an independent testing sample. Results of this study suggest that the candidate genetic variants included in the approved algorithm do not meet reasonable standards of efficacy in identifying OUD risk. Given the algorithm's limited predictive accuracy, its use in clinical care would lead to high rates of both false-positive and false-negative findings. More clinically useful models are needed to identify individuals at risk of developing OUD."

    "abstract": "Canine systemic protothecosis is an uncommon disease caused by <i>Prototheca</i> spp., which are saprophytic algae occurring ubiquitously in nature. Infection occurs most commonly in immunocompromised animals. Most infected dogs have chronic large-bowel diarrhea, ocular lesions, neurologic deficits, or a combination thereof, but various tissues can be affected. This case highlights a unique presentation of protothecosis in a dog, in which lameness resulting from osteomyelitis was the predominant clinical sign. Key clinical message: Although osteomyelitis is an atypical manifestation, protothecosis can be a differential diagnosis for an aggressive bony lesion and is particularly worthy of consideration in immunocompromised dogs."

    "abstract": "Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is gaining momentum as a useful mechanism for analyzing obstructive disorders and surgeries in humans and warrants further development for application in equine surgery. While advancements in procedures continue, much remains unknown about the specific impact that different surgeries have on obstructive airway disorders. The objective of this study was to apply CFD analysis to an equine head inhalation model replicating recurrent laryngeal neuropathy (RLN) and four surgical procedures. CFD was hypothesized to corroborate the order of the different trials based on impedance and to provide an impedance value numerically similar to the experimental results. In addition, it was hypothesized that CFD would offer insights into the changes in airflow associated with each procedure on a finite scale. An equine cadaver head underwent airflow testing and computed tomographic (CT) scans to replicate the disease state (RLN) and four surgical procedures: laryngoplasty, combined laryngoplasty and corniculectomy, corniculectomy, and partial arytenoidectomy. Pressure measurements at the pharynx and trachea were recorded, along with airflow data, for each trial. The CFD and experimental models showed that partial arytenoidectomy had the lowest impedance in this case. While this procedure did have the largest rima glottidis area, the remaining procedural order was not dictated by the rima glottidis area. Recurrent laryngeal neuropathy and combined laryngoplasty with corniculectomy models showed negative pressure concentration on the luminal surface of the left arytenoid cartilage, which indicated a greater collapsing force on the tissue in this region. Narrowing within the caudal larynx at the level of the saccule showed increased negative pressure and higher velocity in the procedures with greater impedance, while partial arytenoidectomy exhibited more uniform pressure and velocity. Although this specific experimental head model contradicted previous flow studies, the CFD model reflected the experimental findings for the procedure with the least impedance and provided some insights into why these discrepancies occurred in this particular case."

    "abstract": "Malnutrition affects over 30 million children annually and has profound immediate and enduring repercussions. Survivors often suffer lasting neurocognitive consequences that impact academic performance and socioeconomic outcomes. Mechanistic understanding of the emergence of these consequences is poorly understood. Using multi-system SHAP interpreted random forest models and network analysis, we show that Moderate Acute Malnutrition (MAM) associates with enrichment of faecal Rothia mucilaginosa, Streptococcus salivarius and depletion of Bacteroides fragilis in a cohort of one-year-old children in Dhaka, Bangladesh. These microbiome changes form interconnected pathways that involve reduced plasma odd-chain fatty acid levels, decreased gamma and beta electroencephalogram power in temporal and frontal brain regions, and reduced vocalization. These findings support the hypothesis that prolonged colonization by oral commensal species delay gut microbiome and brain development. While causal links require empirical validation, this study provides insights to improve interventions targeting MAM-associated neurodevelopmental deficits."

This study aimed to (1) define improvement and worsening in children with MASLD, (2) estimate rates of improvement or deterioration with the standard of care (SOC) over 1 and 2 years, and (3) identify baseline and longitudinal factors associated with improvement or worsening. Using data from 2 large randomized controlled trials, we derived definitions for composite improvement and worsening of MASLD based on associations between changes in ALT, GGT, and liver histology after 1 and 2 years. Improvement was defined as â¥40% decrease in ALT and â¥20% decrease in GGT and worsening as â¥20% increase in both ALT and GGT. We applied definitions to a cohort of 440 children with MASLD. After 1 year of SOC, 22% of children with MASLD showed improvement, increasing to 31% after 2 years. However, 20% showed worsening after both 1 and 2 years despite receiving SOC. Logistic regression analysis, employing stepwise model selection, identified changes in body mass index z-score and cholesterol to be most associated with improvement or deterioration. This study developed criteria for improvement and worsening in children with MASLD over 1 and 2 years of follow-up. With SOC, over one-quarter of children are likely to improve while one-fifth of children are likely to worsen. Targeting interventions that affect body mass index and lipid parameters may help improve MASLD over time."

    "abstract": "<b>Background/Objectives:</b> Wilson's disease (WD) (OMIM 277900) or hepatolenticular degeneration is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by impaired copper excretion with subsequent accumulation in the liver, brain, and other tissues of the body. The defects in copper metabolism are based on various pathogenic variants of the ATP7B gene encoding copper-transporting P-type ATPase. The aim of this work is to search for pathogenic variants of the ATP7B gene among Eastern Eurasian patient cohorts and to pick correlations between pathogenic variants, gender, age of onset of the disease, and the course of the disease. <b>Methods</b>: The material for the study was the biomaterial of 100 people. The search for mutations was carried out by Sanger sequencing. Multiple alignment of nucleotide sequences and their analysis was performed using the MEGA-X software. To study the genotype-phenotypic correlation, an analysis of the medical records of each patient was carried out. <b>Results</b>: Most common pathogenic variant (48%) in the sample is p.His1069Gln (c.3207C>A), located in exon 14 of the ATP7B gene. Pathogenic variants of p.Glu1064Lys (c.3190G>A)-20%-and p.Met769HisfsTer26 (c.2304insC)-8%-of exons 14 and 8 were also common. For patients with pathogenic alleles p.His1069Gln (c.3207C>A) and p.Glu1064Lys (c.3190G>A), typical deviations are mental and neurological manifestations of WD. In patients with the pathogenic allele p.Met769HisfsTer26 (c.2304insC), deviations are more characteristic of the liver and a combination of various symptoms that are atypical for WD. <b>Conclusions</b>: In this study, we were able to obtain differences in symptoms in patients with different pathogenic alleles of the ATP7B gene."

This study's purpose was to determine time to and degree of CTR recurrence following cryoablation. A multicenter retrospective cohort study was conducted on patients who underwent PNN cryoablation to treat CR-related CTR refractory to ipratropium bromide nasal spray (IBNS). Cryoablation was applied along middle meatal posterolateral walls. Demographic and clinical data were collected at clinic visits or by phone surveys. Patients were followed for either 12 months minimum, or until CTR recurrence. Primary outcome measures were time to and degree of CTR improvement and recurrence based on patient-reported runny nose scores (Likert scale, 0-5). Additionally, patients were asked whether their recurrent CTR was bothersome enough to require treatment, and their preference for subsequent treatments. Of 74 CR patients, mean age was 58 years, and 53% were female. Regarding CR subtypes, 74% were nonallergic, 22% mixed, and 4% allergic. Additionally, 78% were IBNS responders. Overall, 62 of 74 (84%) initially improved. Of 60 patients with adequate follow-up for recurrence (mean 31.6 months), 57 (95%) recurred to some degree at a mean 5 months post-treatment. Of those who recurred, 37 (65%) recurred completely to preoperative RNSs, and 11 (19%) achieved 20-25% RNS reduction. Almost 90% of those with recurrent CTR were bothered enough to desire further treatment. PNN cryoablation led to CTR improvement in 84% of CR patients, with nearly 90% of patients developing bothersome recurrent CTR by about 5 months post-treatment. 4 Laryngoscope, 135:1928-1934, 2025."

    "abstract": "Wilson disease (WD) is an autosomal-recessive disorder that disrupts copper homeostasis. ATPase copper transporting beta (ATP7B) gene is implicated as the disease-causing gene in WD. The common symptoms associated with WD include hepatic, neurological, psychiatric, and ophthalmic manifestations. The genetic landscape of WD is under-investigated in the Middle East and has never been studied in Jordan. We aimed to investigate the genetic profile of several unrelated Jordanian families with one or more patients affected by WD. Twenty-four Jordanian families with WD underwent clinical evaluation and genetic profiling by whole-exome and Sanger sequencing. Surprisingly, the same variant (ATP7B:c.3551C>T;p.Ile1184Thr) was identified, for the first time, exclusively in the homozygous state, in eight consanguineous unrelated families. Before our study, the previous classification of this variant was either of uncertain significance (VUS) or likely pathogenic (LP). Interestingly, the patients harboring this variant displayed variable clinical manifestations on both the intra- and interfamilial levels, as previously described in cases with WD. The age of diagnosis, hepatic manifestations, neuropsychiatric involvements, and Kayser-Fleischer ring occurrence varied significantly in terms of existence and severity among the recruited individuals. Following our investigation, based on clinical data and co-segregation analysis, we re-classified the variant ATP7B:c.3551C>T;p.Ile1184Thr from VUS/LP to pathogenic, for the first time. Besides, our genetic analysis helped in resolving diagnostic ambiguity by either establishing or ruling out the diagnosis of WD. Since the identified variant (ATP7B:p.Ile1184Thr) was discovered in multiple unrelated families, we create an avenue for the potential consideration of this variant as a recurrent, or possibly a founder variant, in the Jordanian population. Our work sheds light, for the first time, on the molecular underpinnings of WD in Jordan and compiles the WD-causing variants in the Middle East. Ultimately, the findings of our work can guide designing region-specific targeted genetic testing of WD in Jordan and provide valuable insights to direct clinical decisions for atypical WD presentations."

    "abstract": "Neurodegeneration in glaucoma patients is clinically identified through longitudinal assessment of structure-function changes, including intraocular pressure, cup-to-disc ratios from fundus images, and optical coherence tomography imaging of the retinal nerve fiber layer. Use of human post-mortem ocular tissue for basic research is rising in the glaucoma field, yet there are challenges in assessing disease stage and severity, since tissue donations with informed consent are often unaccompanied by detailed pre-mortem clinical information. Further, the interpretation of disease severity based solely on anatomical and morphological assessments by histology can be affected by differences in death-to-preservation time and tissue processing. These are difficult confounders that cannot be easily controlled. As pathogenesis and molecular mechanisms can vary depending on the stage and severity of glaucoma, there is a need for the field to maximize use of donated tissue to better understand the molecular mechanisms of glaucoma and develop new therapeutic hypotheses. Further, there is a lack of consensus around the molecular RNA and protein markers that can be used to classify glaucoma severity. Here, we describe a multiparametric grading system that combines structural measurements of the retinal nerve fiber layer with linear regression and principal component analyses of molecular markers of retinal ganglion cells and glia (RBPMS, NEFL, IBA1 and GFAP) to stratify post-mortem glaucoma eyes by the severity of disease. Our findings show that a quantitative grading approach can stratify post-mortem glaucoma samples with minimal clinical histories into at least three severity groups and suggest that this type of approach may be useful for researchers aiming to maximize insights derived from eye bank donor tissue."

We report results from the first-in-human, phase 1 trial of AG-270/S095033 as monotherapy in patients with advanced malignancies (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03435250). Eligible patients had tumors with homozygous deletion of CDKN2A/MTAP and/or loss of MTAP protein by immunohistochemistry. Patients received AG-270/S095033 once daily (QD) or twice daily (BID) in 28-day cycles. The primary objective was to assess the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of AG-270/S095033. Secondary objectives included safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and efficacy. Forty patients were treated with AG-270/S095033. Plasma concentrations of AG-270/S095033 increased with dose. Maximal reductions in plasma SAM concentrations ranged from 54% to 70%. Analysis of paired tumor biopsies showed decreases in levels of symmetrically di-methylated arginine (SDMA) residues.

We enrolled outpatients aged â¥8 months with acute respiratory illness in 7 states. Respiratory specimens were tested for influenza type/subtype by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Influenza VE was estimated with a test-negative design comparing odds of testing positive for influenza among vaccinated versus unvaccinated participants. We estimated VE by virus sub-type/lineage and A(H1N1)pdm09 genetic subclades. Among 6,589 enrolled patients, 1,770 (27%) tested positive for influenza including 796 A(H1N1)pdm09, 563 B/Victoria, and 323 A(H3N2). Vaccine effectiveness against any influenza illness was 41% (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 32 to 49): 28% (95% CI: 13 to 40) against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, 68% (95% CI: 59 to 76) against B/Victoria, and 30% (95% CI: 9 to 47) against A(H3N2). Statistically significant protection against any influenza was found for all age groups except adults aged 50-64 years. Lack of protection in this age group was specific to influenza A-associated illness. We observed differences in VE by birth cohort and A(H1N1)pdm09 virus genetic subclade. Vaccination reduced outpatient medically attended influenza overall by 41% and provided protection overall against circulating influenza A and B viruses.

However, concerns exist about their potential cardiovascular risks due to CGRP blockade. To compare the incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) between Medicare beneficiaries with migraine who initiated anti-CGRP-mAbs vs onabotulinumtoxinA in the US. This retrospective, sequential cohort study was conducted among a nationally representative population-based sample of Medicare claims from May 2018 through December 2020. Data analysis was performed from August to December 2023. This study included fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries aged 18 years or older with migraine who initiated either anti-CGRP mAbs or onabotulinumtoxinA. Beneficiaries who had a history of myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, cluster headache, malignant cancer, or hospice service within a 1-year baseline period prior to treatment initiation were excluded. To minimize channeling bias from new drug introductions and time-related bias due to the COVID-19 pandemic, 5 cohorts were established, representing sequential 6-month calendar intervals based on the initial prescription or date of index anti-CGRP mAbs or onabotulinumtoxinA use. Anti-CGRP mAbs vs onabotulinumtoxinA. The primary outcome was time to first MI or stroke. Secondary outcomes included hypertensive crisis, peripheral revascularization, and Raynaud phenomenon. The inverse probability of treatment-weighted Cox proportional hazards models were used to compare outcomes between the 2 treatment groups. Among 266 848 eligible patients with migraine, 5153 patients initiated anti-CGRP mAbs (mean [SD] age, 57.8 [14.0] years; 4308 female patients [83.6%]) and 4000 patients initiated onabotulinumtoxinA (mean [SD] age, 61.9 [13.7] years; 3353 female patients [83.8%]). Use of anti-CGRP mAbs was not associated with an increased risk of composite CVD events (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 0.88; 95% CI, 0.44-1.77), hypertensive crisis (aHR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.14-1.55), peripheral revascularization (aHR, 1.50; 95% CI, 0.48-4.73), or Raynaud phenomenon (aHR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.45-1.24) compared with onabotulinumtoxinA. Subgroup analyses by age group and presence of established non-MI or stroke CVD showed similar findings. In this cohort study, despite initial concerns regarding the cardiovascular effects of CGRP blockade, anti-CGRP mAbs were not associated with an increased risk of CVD compared with onabotulinumtoxinA among adult Medicare beneficiaries with migraine, who were predominantly older adults or individuals with disability. Future studies with longer follow-up periods and in other populations are needed to confirm these findings."

However, the efficacy of beta-blockers and angiotensin receptor blockers or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) in SRV patients is unproven. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of ACEI/ARB and beta-blockers on outcomes in SRV patients after accounting for likely cofounders affecting their use. From a retrospective, multicenter study on heart failure-related outcome in individuals with SRV, those who were taking an ACEI/ARB, beta-blocker, or both of these medication were identified. We performed a propensity analysis to match them to those not using these medications at their initial visit. Matching was based on a propensity score, which captured co-morbidities, demographics, and baseline echocardiographic parameters. Primary outcome of death, transplant, or mechanical circulatory support, and secondary outcomes of heart failure hospitalizations/atrial arrhythmias were analyzed respectively. We identified 393 patients taking ACEI/ARB or beta-blocker, or taking both a beta-blocker and ACEI/ARB (62.1% male, median age 31.3 years) and 484 patients (56.4% male, median age of 26.0 years) who were neither on a beta-blocker nor on ACEI/ARB at the time of initial clinic visit. Median follow-up was â¼8 years. After propensity matching, medication use was not associated with decreased mortality, heart failure hospitalizations, or arrhythmias. Hazard ratios remained positive for beta blockers, implying potential harm rather than benefit. In this large multicenter propensity-matched observational study, patients with SRV taking beta-blockers or ACEI/ARB did not have a benefit in survival or reduced hospitalization. The likelihood of demonstrating favorable effects in larger studies appears remote."

    "abstract": "Inclusion body myositis (IBM) is an idiopathic inflammatory myopathy with muscle pathology characterized by endomysial inflammation, rimmed vacuoles, and cytoplasmic mislocalization of transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43). We aimed to determine whether loss of TDP-43 splicing repression led to the production of \"cryptic peptides\" that could be detected in muscle biopsies as a useful biomarker for IBM. We used an antisera against a neoepitope encoded by a TDP-43-dependent cryptic exon within hepatoma-derived growth factor-like protein 2 (HDGFL2) for immunohistochemical analysis on muscle biopsy samples of 122 patients with IBM, 181 disease controls, and 16 healthy controls without abnormal muscle pathology. In situ hybridization was also utilized to detect the localization of cryptic HDGFL2 transcripts. We found cryptic HDGFL2 peptides localized within myonuclei from muscle biopsies in 79 of 122 patients with IBM (65%), and this staining correlated with TDP-43 depletion. In contrast, cryptic HDGFL2 immunoreactivity was absent in 197 muscle biopsies from a variety of disease controls, except for 2 patients with vacuolar myopathies. Notably, we show that cryptic HDGFL2 transcripts are accompanied by the detection of cryptic HDGFL2 in muscle fibers of IBM without rimmed vacuoles and TDP-43 aggregates. Together, our findings establish that loss of TDP-43 splicing repression occurs in myonuclei of IBM skeletal muscle and suggest that detection of cryptic peptides in muscle biopsies may be a useful biomarker. We suggest that a therapeutic strategy designed to restore TDP-43 function should be considered to attenuate the degeneration of skeletal muscle in this devastating disease.

Immunocompromised patients are at increased risk for fungal infections. This case highlights the complexities of managing AFRS in patients not eligible for surgery. We present a 32-year-old patient with a history of Wilson's disease and a previous liver transplant on immunosuppressive medications. The patient presented to our tertiary hospital with a year-long history of bilateral progressive nasal obstruction, along with diplopia, anterior and posterior rhinorrhea, intermittent numbness on the left side of her face, tinnitus and nausea. Initial imaging revealed extensive sinonasal disease with hyperdense components. FESS was performed, and biopsy and culture confirmed the diagnosis of AFRS. Notably, gross dehiscence of the carotid arteries was observed during surgery. Three and a half years after surgery, the patient experienced a relapse of symptoms after COVID-19 infection. Due to the risk of inadvertent damage to the carotid artery during surgery, the patient was offered a trial of dupilumab instead. The patient reported complete resolution of symptoms 6 months after starting dupilumab. Given the significant surgical risks associated with carotid artery dehiscence, a trial of dupilumab was initiated. This biologic therapy, known for its efficacy in treating type 2 inflammatory conditions, resulted in a remarkable response, with complete resolution of symptoms within six months. Previous reports of dupilumab use in AFRS have yielded similar outcomes. The case underscores the potential of dupilumab as a safe and effective alternative for managing recalcitrant AFRS, particularly in patients at high risk for surgical complications."

    "abstract": "Post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) is a painful joint disease characterized by the degradation of bone, cartilage, and other connective tissues in the joint. PTOA is initiated by trauma to joint-stabilizing tissues, such as the anterior cruciate ligament, medial meniscus, or by intra-articular fractures. In humans, ~50% of joint injuries progress to PTOA, while the rest spontaneously resolve. To better understand molecular programs contributing to PTOA development or resolution, we examined injury-induced fluctuations in immune cell populations and transcriptional shifts by single-cell RNA sequencing of synovial joints in PTOA-susceptible C57BL/6J (B6) and PTOA-resistant MRL/MpJ (MRL) mice. We identified significant differences in monocyte and macrophage subpopulations between MRL and B6 joints. A potent myeloid-driven anti-inflammatory response was observed in MRL injured joints that significantly contrasted the pro-inflammatory signaling seen in B6 joints. Multiple CD206+ macrophage populations classically described as M2 were found enriched in MRL injured joints. These CD206+ macrophages also robustly expressed Trem2, a receptor involved in inflammation and myeloid cell activation. These data suggest that the PTOA resistant MRL mouse strain displays an enhanced capacity of clearing debris and apoptotic cells induced by inflammation after injury due to an increase in activated M2 macrophages within the synovial tissue and joint space."

We characterized the clinical spectrum, highlighting particularly the epilepsy phenotype, and the effect of treatments. We analyzed retrospectively the phenotypes and genotypes of 43 individuals with TRPM3 variants, acquired from GeneMatcher and collaborations (n = 21), and through a systematic literature search (n = 22). We included all patients with a pathogenic TRPM3 variant. The median age at the time of the study was 10 years, with a preponderance of girls (60%) versus boys (40%). Frequent findings were developmental delay and/or intellectual disability (93%), global or axial hypotonia (77%), ocular involvement (70%), musculoskeletal anomalies (65%), and dysmorphic features (58%). Epilepsy was diagnosed in 31 patients (72%), classified in all as developmental and epileptic encephalopathy with or without spike wave activation in sleep (DEE/DEE-SWAS). Patients with the variant p.Val1002Met (n = 24) significantly more often had developmental delay and epilepsy. The most effective anti-seizure medication was primidone. All treated patients showed an improvement in seizure frequency, motor and speech development, and/or learning capability with this drug. Developmental delay/intellectual disability and epilepsy are dominant phenotypic features in patients with TRPM3 variants. Given that epilepsy can negatively impact development, screening for awake and sleep electroencephalogram abnormalities and other manifestations are essential to offer early intervention. The TRPM3 channel blocker primidone has shown promising effects and should be considered in every child with a TRPM3 gain-of-function variant. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:561-570."

    "abstract": "Up to 20% of older adults in the United States have mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and about one-third of people with MCI are predicted to transition to Alzheimer's disease (AD) within 5 years. Standard cognitive assessments are long and require a trained technician to administer. We developed the first computerized adaptive test (CAT) based on multidimensional item response theory (MIRT) to more precisely, rapidly, and repeatedly assesses cognitive abilities across the adult lifespan. We present results for a prototype CAT (pCAT-COG) for assessment of global cognitive function. We sampled items across five cognitive domains central to neuropsychological testing (episodic memory [EM], semantic memory/language [SM], working memory [WM], executive function/flexible thinking, and processing speed [PS]). The item bank consists of 54 items, with 9 items of varying difficulty drawn from six different cognitive tasks. Each of the 54 items has 3 response trials, yielding an ordinal score (0-3 trials correct). We also include three long-term memory items not designed for adaptive administration, for a total bank of 57 items. Calibration data were collected in-person and online, calibrated using a bifactor MIRT model, and pCAT-COG scores validated against a technician-administered neuropsychological battery. The bifactor MIRT model improved fit over a unidimensional IRT model (<i>p</i> < 0.0001). The global pCAT-COG scores were inversely correlated with age (<i>r</i> = -0.44, <i>p</i> < 0.0001). Simulated adaptive administration of 11 items maintained a correlation of <i>r</i> = 0.94 with the total item bank scores. Significant differences between mild and no cognitive impairment (NCI) were found (effect size of 1.08 SD units). The pCAT-COG correlated with clinician-based global measure (<i>r</i> = 0.64). MIRT-based CAT is feasible and valid for the assessment of global cognitive impairment, laying the foundation for the development of a full CAT-COG that will draw from a much larger item bank with both global and domain specific measures of cognitive impairment. As Americans age, numbers at risk for developing cognitive impairment are increasing.Aging-related declines in cognition begins decades prior to the onset of obvious cognitive impairment.Traditional assessment is burdensome and requires trained clinicians.We developed an adaptive testing framework using multidimensional item response theory.It is comparable to lengthier in-person assessments that require trained psychometrists."

We identified 13, 31 and 21 common variant loci for SND, DCD and PM, respectively. Four well-known loci (SCN5A/SCN10A, CCDC141, TBX20 and CAMK2D) were shared for SND and DCD, while others were more specific for SND or DCD. SND and DCD showed a moderate genetic correlation (r<sub>g</sub> = 0.63). Cardiomyocyte-expressed genes were enriched for contributions to DCD heritability. Rare-variant analyses implicated LMNA for all bradyarrhythmia phenotypes, SMAD6 and SCN5A for DCD and TTN, MYBPC3 and SCN5A for PM. These results show that variation in multiple genetic pathways (for example, ion channel function, cardiac developmental programs, sarcomeric structure and cellular homeostasis) appear critical to the development of bradyarrhythmias."

Proton nuclear magnetic resonance metabolomics provides a high-throughput means for urinary metabolite profiling, as widely applied for blood biomarker studies. Here we report a genome-wide association study meta-analysed for 3 European cohorts comprising 8,011 individuals, covering both people with type 1 diabetes and general population settings. We identify 54 associations (p < 9.3 Ã 10<sup>-10</sup>) for 19 of 54 studied metabolite concentrations. Out of these, 33 were not reported previously for relevant urinary or blood metabolite traits. Subsequent two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis suggests that estimated glomerular filtration rate causally affects 13 urinary metabolite concentrations whereas urinary ethanolamine, an initial precursor for phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine, was associated with higher eGFR lending support for a potential protective role. Our study provides a catalogue of genetic associations for 53 metabolites, enabling further investigation on how urinary metabolites are linked to human health."

    "abstract": "Key functions of antibodies, such as viral neutralisation, depend on high-affinity binding. However, viral neutralisation poorly correlates with antigen affinity for reasons that have been unclear. Here, we use a new mechanistic model of bivalent binding to study >45 patient-isolated IgG1 antibodies interacting with SARS-CoV-2 RBD surfaces. The model provides the standard monovalent affinity/kinetics and new bivalent parameters, including the molecular reach: the maximum antigen separation enabling bivalent binding. We find large variations in these parameters across antibodies, including reach variations (22-46 nm) that exceed the physical antibody size (~15 nm). By using antigens of different physical sizes, we show that these large molecular reaches are the result of both the antibody and antigen sizes. Although viral neutralisation correlates poorly with affinity, a striking correlation is observed with molecular reach. Indeed, the molecular reach explains differences in neutralisation for antibodies binding with the same affinity to the same RBD-epitope. Thus, antibodies within an isotype class binding the same antigen can display differences in molecular reach, substantially modulating their binding and functional properties."

    "abstract": "Hepatolenticular degeneration, also known as Wilson's disease, is a type of autosomal recessive genetic disorder of copper metabolism. The causative gene, ATP7B, is located on the long arm of chromosome 13 and encodes a P-type ATPase that is involved in copper transport. Pathogenic mutations in the ATP7B gene sequence lead to the diminished or lost function of the ATP7B protein, resulting in pathological copper deposition in organs such as the liver, brain, kidneys, and cornea. Currently, the treatment of Wilson's disease primarily involves oral medications to promote copper excretion or reduce copper absorption so as to alleviate the state of illness. However, pharmacological treatment has objective limitations, including the need for lifelong therapy and varying degrees of adverse drug reactions in some patients. Gene therapy can fully correct the genetic defect, restore ATP7B protein function, achieve a curative effect, and improve the patient's quality of life."

    "abstract": "Endometriosis, the growth of endometrial-like tissue outside the uterus, causes chronic pain and infertility in 10 % of reproductive-aged women worldwide. Unfortunately, no permanent cure exists, and current medical and surgical treatments offer only temporary relief. Endometriosis is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by immune system dysfunction. Our previous study showed aberrant activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) in endometriosis. Our transcriptomic analysis of uterine tissue from uterine-specific Stat3 knock-out mice identifies that STAT3 regulates inflammatory and immune-related genes. Here, we evaluate cerium-oxide nanoparticles (nanoceria) as a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug for endometriosis theranostics. Our in vitro studies validate the multi-enzymatic properties of nanoceria, enabling the transition of pro-inflammatory macrophages to an anti-inflammatory state in J774 macrophage cells. In vivo, treatment of endometriosis mice with nanoceria reveals its ability to passively accumulate at ectopic lesions. The nanoceria conjugated with indocyanine green are non-invasively trackable to ectopic lesions. Therefore, immune modulation and anti-inflammatory effects of nanoceria significantly reduce development of ectopic lesions while minimizing off-target effects, such as avoiding interference with pregnancy including implantation and decidualization. Our results suggest that aberrant STAT3 activation is a major contributor to endometriosis, and nanoceria offers a novel theranostic approach for endometriosis."

Moreover, inferior temporal <sup>18</sup>F-PI-2620 uptake was significantly elevated in Î²-amyloid positive relative to Î²-amyloid negative participants with Lewy body disease. Temporal lobe <sup>18</sup>F-PI-2620 signal was not associated with memory in Lewy body disease, but uptake within precuneus and lingual gyrus was associated with worse executive function and attention/working memory performance. Finally, substantia nigra <sup>18</sup>F-PI-2620 signal was significantly reduced in participants with Parkinson's disease, and lower substantia nigra signal was associated with greater motor impairment. These findings suggest that although levels are lower than in Alzheimer's disease, small elevations in cortical tau are associated with cognitive function in Lewy body disease relevant domains, and that reduced <sup>18</sup>F-PI-2620 binding in substantia nigra may represent loss of dopaminergic neurons. Cortical tau and neuromelanin binding within substantia nigra represent two unique signals in the same PET image that may be informative in the context of cognitive and motor deficits, respectively, in Lewy body disease."

    "abstract": "The aims of this study were to develop an automatic system capable of calculating four radiological measurements used in the diagnosis and monitoring of cerebral palsy (CP)-related hip disease, and to demonstrate that these measurements are sufficiently accurate to be used in clinical practice. We developed a machine-learning system to automatically measure Reimer's migration percentage (RMP), acetabular index (ACI), head shaft angle (HSA), and neck shaft angle (NSA). The system automatically locates points around the femoral head and acetabulum on pelvic radiographs, and uses these to calculate measurements. The system was evaluated on 1,650 pelvic radiographs of children with CP (682 females and 968 males, mean age 8.3 years (SD 4.5)). Each radiograph was manually measured by five clinical experts. Agreement between the manual clinical measurements and the automatic system was assessed by mean absolute deviation (MAD) from the mean manual measurement, type 1 and type 2 intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs), and a linear mixed-effects model (LMM) for assessing bias. The MAD scores were 5.7% (SD 8.5%) for RMP, 4.3Â° (SD 5.4Â°) for ACI, 5.0Â° (SD 5.2Â°) for NSA, and 5.7Â° (SD 6.1Â°) for HSA. Overall ICCs quantifying the agreement between the mean manual measurement and the automatic results were 0.91 for RMP, 0.66 for ACI, 0.85 for NSA, and 0.73 for HSA. The LMM showed no statistically significant bias. The results showed excellent agreement between the manual and automatic measurements for RMP, good agreement for NSA, and moderate agreement for HSA and ACI. The performance of the system is sufficient for application in clinical practice to support the assessment of hip migration based on RMP. The system has the potential to save clinicians time and to improve patient care by enabling more comprehensive, consistent, and reliable monitoring of hip migration in children with CP."

CRC samples from Caris Life Sciences (Phoenix, AZ) were analyzed using NextGen DNA sequencing, whole transcriptome sequencing, whole exome sequencing, and immunohistochemistry (IHC); and stratified based on MCL-1 expression as top quartile MCL-1<sup>high</sup> (Q4) and bottom quartile MCL-1<sup>low</sup> (Q1). Immune cell infiltration (CI) in the tumor microenvironment (TME) was measured using RNA deconvolution analysis (QuanTIseq). MCL-1<sup>high</sup> tumors were associated with an increased rate of programmed death ligand 1 IHC, higher T cell-inflamed signature, interferon score, microsatellite instability-high and tumor mutational burden-high status. MCL-1<sup>high</sup> was associated with higher mutation rates of BCOR, TP53, KMT2D, ASXL1, KDM6A, ATM, MSH6, SPEN, KRAS, STK11, GNAS, RNF43, and lower mutation rates of CDKN1B, NRAS, and APC, and copy number amplifications in several genes. MCL-1<sup>high</sup> TME had higher CI of M1 and M2 macrophages, B cells, natural killer cells, neutrophils, and T-regulatory cells infiltration, and lower CI of myeloid dendritic cells. Higher MCL-1 expression is significantly associated with favorable clinical outcomes in CRC cohorts. Our data showed a strong correlation between MCL-1 and distinct immune biomarkers and TME CI in CRC. Our findings suggest MCL-1 is a potential modulator of antitumor immunity, TME, and biomarker in CRC."

It causes hepatic and/or neuropsychiatric manifestations. This copper deposition causes cirrhosis of the liver, encephalopathy and liver failure. It also causes disorders of the menstrual cycle and subfertility. During pregnancy, there is an increased risk of the development of preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction, and neurologic damages to the fetus. Pregnancy with decompensated liver cirrhosis developed more complications like bleeding from esophageal varices, liver failure, encephalopathy, and rupture of the splenic artery.

This study investigated the long-term effects of exposure to a patient-derived GluN1-specific mAb during a critical developmental period (from postnatal day 3 to day 12) in mice. We observed long-lasting sensory-motor deficits characteristic of NMDAR-AE, along with permanent changes in callosal axons within the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) in adulthood, including increased terminal branch complexity. This complexity was associated with paroxysmal recruitment of neurons in S1 in response to callosal stimulation. Particularly during complex motor tasks, mAb3-treated mice exhibited significantly reduced interhemispheric functional connectivity between S1 regions, consistent with pronounced sensory-motor behavioral deficits. These findings suggest that transient exposure to anti-GluN1 mAb during a critical developmental window may lead to irreversible morphological and functional changes in callosal axons, which could significantly impair sensory-motor integration and contribute to long-lasting sensory-motor deficits. Our study establishes a new model of NMDAR-AE and identifies novel cellular and network-level mechanisms underlying persistent sensory-motor deficits in this context. These insights lay the foundation for future research into molecular mechanisms and the development of targeted therapeutic interventions."

The mvGPT combines an engineered compact prime editor (PE), a fusion activator MS2-p65-HSF1 (MPH), and a drive-and-process multiplex array that produces RNAs tailored to different types of genetic perturbation. mvGPT can precisely edit human genome via PE coupled with a prime editing guide RNA and a nicking guide RNA, activate endogenous gene expression using PE with a truncated single guide RNA containing MPH-recruiting MS2 aptamers, and silence endogenous gene expression via RNA interference with a short-hairpin RNA. We showcase the versatility of mvGPT by simultaneously correcting a c.3207C>A mutation in the ATP7B gene linked to Wilson's disease, upregulating the PDX1 gene expression to potentially treat Type I diabetes, and suppressing the TTR gene to manage transthyretin amyloidosis.

To address this issue, we conducted a study in which we compared the baseline no-show rate with the rate after relocating both clinics to the same floor, aiming to overcome patient-related barriers. Following 3.5 months of the clinics sharing the same floor, the no-show rate decreased to 39%, reflecting a 10% improvement from the baseline rate.

Animal models are a vital tool for investigating cancer biology and its treatment, but have known limitations. There have been advances in glioblastoma modeling techniques in this century although it is unclear to what extent they have been adopted. We searched Pubmed and EMBASE using terms designed to identify all publications reporting an animal glioma experiment, using a machine learning algorithm to assist with screening. We reviewed the full text of a sample of 1000 articles and then used the findings to inform a screen of all included abstracts to appraise the modeling applications across the entire dataset. The search identified 26 201 publications of which 13 783 were included at screening. The automated screening had high sensitivity but limited specificity. We observed a dominance of traditional cell line paradigms and the emergence of advanced tumor model systems eclipsed by a large increase in the volume of cell line experiments. Few studies used more than 1 model in vivo and most publications did not verify critical genetic features. Advanced models have clear advantages in terms of tumor and disease recapitulation and have largely not replaced traditional cell lines which have a number of critical deficiencies that limit their viability in modern animal research. The judicious use of advanced models or more relevant cell lines might improve the translational relevance of future animal glioblastoma experimentation."

The secondary aim was to determine whether common laboratory tests were associated with liver copper concentrations or the need for liver transplantation in a subset of patients with confirmed WD. Using our institution's laboratory information system, 197 patients with liver copper concentrations > 250 mcg/g were identified who also had a concurrent liver iron concentration available. Correlations between copper, iron, and hepatic iron index were performed by log-transforming the data and then using the Pearson method. Furthermore, in a subpopulation of ten patients clinically confirmed to have WD, various laboratory test values were evaluated to determine associations with liver copper concentration or liver transplantation. There was no significant association between copper and iron liver tissue concentrations (p=0.84). However, 13 (8%) patients aged 13 or older had a hepatic iron index >1.0 which may indicate secondary iron overload. Furthermore, in clinically confirmed WD patients, hemoglobin and hematocrit were inversely associated with liver copper concentrations (p=0.036).

Four synthesised findings were identified: (i) accurate, up-to-date knowledge of viral hepatitis disease and treatment among people in prison and staff is a facilitator to programme uptake, particularly when imparted by a trusted source; (ii) personal subjective and relative views have a bearing on participation with the programme; (iii) social interactions and relationships both within the community of people in prison and between them and staff groups influence participation in the programmes; and (iv) the organisational structure of the prison and healthcare services within it affect programme participation. Based on these findings, we make recommendations for the adaptation of viral hepatitis programmes to individual custodial settings thereby improving equitable programme access and hepatitis B and C reduction in this complex environment."

    "title": "Eighty-Nine Cases of Primary Prostatic Signet Ring Cell Carcinoma-Systematic Review.",
    "abstract": "Signet ring cell adenocarcinoma is a rare subtype of mucinous adenocarcinoma that affects the gastrointestinal tract and the prostate. Prostatic signet ring cell carcinoma comprises 0.02% of all cases of prostate cancer and 0.4% of all signet ring cell cancers. The aim of this review was to summarize the existing literature on primary prostatic signet ring cell carcinoma by assessing patient demographics, clinical presentations, investigations, treatment methods, and survival outcomes. A systematic review was conducted in multiple databases, including 46 articles comprising 89 individual cases of primary prostatic signet ring cell carcinoma. Data was extracted and analyzed using descriptive statistics. The average age of patients with primary prostatic signet ring cell carcinoma was 68.5 years, and most cases were reported in Caucasian individuals. Clinical presentations varied, with lower urinary tract symptoms being the most common. Biochemical markers, such as prostate-specific antigen, were often elevated. Imaging modalities, including computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, were used for diagnosis, and it found that one-third had metastatic disease on diagnosis. Treatment options included radical prostatectomy, hormone therapy, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. The prognosis for primary prostatic signet ring cell carcinoma was poor, with a 3-year survival rate of approximately 17%. Primary prostatic signet ring cell carcinoma is a rare and aggressive form of prostate cancer. The limited literature on this condition highlights the need for further research. These systematic review findings contribute to a better understanding of this disease and may guide future clinical management strategies."

    "abstract": "Using a pediatric-focused lens, this review article briefly summarizes the presentation of several demyelinating and neuroinflammatory diseases using conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences, such as T1-weighted with and without an exogenous gadolinium-based contrast agent, T2-weighted, and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR). These conventional sequences exploit the intrinsic properties of tissue to provide a distinct signal contrast that is useful for evaluating disease features and monitoring treatment responses in patients by characterizing lesion involvement in the central nervous system and tracking temporal features with blood-brain barrier disruption. Illustrative examples are presented for pediatric-onset multiple sclerosis and neuroinflammatory diseases. This work also highlights findings from advanced MRI techniques, often infrequently employed due to the challenges involved in acquisition, post-processing, and interpretation, and identifies the need for future studies to extract the unique information, such as alterations in neurochemistry, disruptions of structural organization, or atypical functional connectivity, that may be relevant for the diagnosis and management of disease."

    "title": "Challenges in Implementing Comprehensive Precision Medicine Screening for Ovarian Cancer.",
    "abstract": "Precision medicine has revolutionised targeted cancer treatments; however, its implementation in ovarian cancer remains challenging. Diverse tumour biology and extensive heterogeneity in ovarian cancer can limit the translatability of genetic profiling and contribute to a lack of biomarkers of treatment response. This review addresses the barriers in precision medicine for ovarian cancer, including obtaining adequate and representative tissue samples for analysis, developing functional and standardised screening methods, and navigating data infrastructure and management. Ethical concerns related to patient consent, data privacy and health equity are also explored. We highlight the socio-economic complexities for precision medicine and propose strategies to overcome these challenges with an emphasis on accessibility and education amongst patients and health professionals and the development of regulatory frameworks to support clinical integration. Interdisciplinary collaboration is essential to drive progress in precision medicine to improve disease management and ovarian cancer patient outcomes."

(2) Methods: A retrospective cohort of patients with gynaecologic cancers diagnosed with brain metastases treated with radiation at a tertiary care centre from 1 January 2004 until 30 September 2023 was studied. Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test were used to evaluate survival, and cox regression was used to identify significant predictive factors of survival. (3) Results: In total, 103 patients were included in this study. Median age at diagnosis of brain metastases was 59 (range 30-94). Median survival time following diagnosis of brain metastases was 3.6 months (range 0.4-183.8). Survival was significantly longer for patients treated with surgery combined with radiation compared to radiation alone and with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) compared to whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT). Cox regression revealed that primary ovarian malignancy, extracranial disease at diagnosis, and â¥3 brain metastases were associated with poorer prognosis, and complete response to prior treatment was associated with more favourable prognosis. (4) Conclusions: Data from this study will assist in providing evidence-based prognostic information to patients with gynaecologic malignancy diagnosed with brain metastases."

    "title": "Neuroinflammatory pathways and potential therapeutic targets in neonatal post-hemorrhagic hydrocephalus.",
    "abstract": "Post-hemorrhagic hydrocephalus (PHH) is a severe complication in premature infants following intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH). It is characterized by abnormal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) accumulation, disrupted CSF dynamics, and elevated intracranial pressure (ICP), leading to significant neurological impairments. This review provides an overview of recent molecular insights into the pathophysiology of PHH and evaluates emerging therapeutic approaches aimed at addressing its underlying mechanisms. Recent studies were reviewed, focusing on molecular and cellular mechanisms implicated in PHH, including neuroinflammatory pathways, immune mediators, and regulatory genes. The potential of advanced technologies such as whole genome/exome sequencing, proteomics, epigenetics, and single-cell transcriptomics to identify key molecular targets was also analyzed. PHH has been strongly linked to neuroinflammatory processes triggered by the degradation of blood byproducts. These processes involve cytokines, chemokines, the complement system, and other immune mediators, as well as regulatory genes and epigenetic mechanisms. Current treatments, primarily surgical CSF diversion, do not address the underlying molecular pathology. Emerging therapies, such as mesenchymal stem cell-based interventions, show promise in modulating immune responses and mitigating neurological damage. However, concerns about the safety of these novel approaches in neonatal populations and their potential effects on brain development remain unresolved. Advanced molecular tools and emerging therapies have the potential to transform the treatment of PHH by targeting its underlying pathophysiology. Further research is needed to validate these approaches, enhance their safety profiles, and improve outcomes for infants with PHH. 1. This review elucidates the molecular complexities of post-hemorrhagic hydrocephalus (PHH) by examining specific immune pathways and their impact on disease pathogenesis and progression. 2. It outlines the application of genomic, epigenomic, and proteomic technologies to identify critical molecular targets in PHH, setting the stage for innovative, targeted therapeutic approaches that could improve the outcomes of neonates affected by PHH. 3. It discusses the potential of gene and stem cell therapies in treating PHH, offering non-surgical alternatives and focusing on the underlying neuroinflammatory mechanisms."

    "abstract": "This paper describes Epihiper, a state-of-the-art, high performance computational modeling framework for epidemic science. The Epihiper modeling framework supports custom disease models, and can simulate epidemics over dynamic, large-scale networks while supporting modulation of the epidemic evolution through a set of user-programmable interventions. The nodes and edges of the social-contact network have customizable sets of static and dynamic attributes which allow the user to specify intervention target sets at a very fine-grained level; these also permit the network to be updated in response to nonpharmaceutical interventions, such as school closures. The execution of interventions is governed by trigger conditions, which are Boolean expressions formed using any of Epihiper's primitives (e.g. the current time, transmissibility) and user-defined sets (e.g. people with work activities). Rich expressiveness, extensibility, and high-performance computing responsiveness were central design goals to ensure that the framework could effectively target realistic scenarios at the scale and detail required to support the large computational designs needed by state and federal public health policymakers in their efforts to plan and respond in the event of epidemics. The modeling framework has been used to support the CDC Scenario Modeling Hub for COVID-19 response, and was a part of a hybrid high-performance cloud system that was nominated as a finalist for the 2021 ACM Gordon Bell Special Prize for high performance computing-based COVID-19 Research."

    "abstract": "Thirty-four per cent of deaths among Americans aged 1-46 are due to injury, and many of these deaths could be prevented if all hospitals performed as well as the highest-performing hospitals. The Institute of Medicine and the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine have called for learning health systems, with emphasis on clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) as a means of limiting preventable deaths. Reduction in mortality has been demonstrated when evidence-based trauma CPGs are adhered to; however, guidelines are variably updated, redundant, absent, inaccessible, or perceived as irrelevant. Ultimately, these barriers result in poor guideline implementation and preventable patient deaths. This multidisciplinary group of injury providers, clinical guidance developers and end users, public health and health policy experts and implementation scientists propose key areas for consideration in the definition of an ideal future state for clinical guidance development and dissemination. Suggestions include (1): professional societies collaborate rather than compete for guideline development.(2) Design primary clinical research for implementation, and where relevant, with guideline development in mind.(3) Select clinical topics for guideline development through systematic prioritization, with an emphasis on patient-centered outcomes.(4) Develop guideline authorship groups with a focus on transparency, equity of opportunity and diversity of representation.(5) Establish a plan for regular review and updating and provide the date the guideline was last updated for transparency.(6) Integrate options for adapting the guideline to local resources and needs at the time of development.(7) Make guidelines available on a platform that allows for open feedback and utilization tracking.(8) Improve discoverability of guidelines.(9) Optimize user-experience with a focus on inclusion of bedside-ready, mobile-friendly infographics, tables or algorithms when feasible.(10) Use open access and open licenses.(11) Disseminate clinical guidance via comprehensive and equitable communication channels. Guidelines are key to improve patient outcomes. The proposed focus to ensure trauma guidelines are equitably and effectively developed and disseminated globally."

In this study, we performed a retrospective cohort study of 105 WD patients (99 index cases, 6 siblings) with an onset age â¥35 years. We compared 99 index late-onset patients with 1237 early-onset patients and analyzed the ATP7B variant penetrance referring to the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD). Sixty-two ATP7B variants were identified in the late-onset patients, among which A874V, V1106I, R919G, and T935M were correlated with late presentation of WD. Regarding gnomAD, V1106I and T935M exhibited significantly low penetrance, and there is a lack of patients carrying a genotype of V1106I/V1106I, R919G/R919G, T935M/T935M, V1106I/T935M, V1106I/R919G, or T935M/R919G. Our data revealed that patients carrying a combination of two late-onset variants may be overlooked due to atypical or lack of WD symptoms, which may provide valuable insights into the genetic basis and diagnosis of WD."

    "abstract": "Intracerebral schwannomas are rare tumors resembling their peripheral nerve sheath counterparts but localized in the central nervous system (CNS). They are not classified as a separate tumor type in the 2021 World Health Organization classification. This study aimed to compile and characterize these rare neoplasms morphologically and molecularly. We analyzed 20 tumor samples by histology, RNA next-generation sequencing, DNA-methylation profiling, copy number analyses, and single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq). Clinical data, including age, sex, and disease progression, were collected. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) series were included when available. All cases with tissue available for histology review (n = 13) were morphologically consistent with intracerebral schwannoma, but differed in their extent of glial fibrillary acidic protein staining. All (n = 20) shared DNA-methylation profiles distinct from other CNS tumors, as well as from Vestigial-like family (VGLL)-altered peripheral nerve sheath tumors. Most cases (n = 14/17) harbored fusions of either Vestigial-like family member 3 (VGLL3) or Vestigial-like Family member 1 (VGLL1) (CHD7::VGLL3 [n = 9/17] and EWSR1::VGLL1 [n = 5/17]). In 2 cases, the presence of a VGLL3 fusion was also confirmed by copy number analyses (n = 2/17). MRI (n = 4) showed well-defined, nodular tumors with strong, homogeneous enhancement and no diffusion restriction. Tumors were located throughout the neuroaxis (supratentorial [n = 15], infratentorial [n = 4], and spinal [n = 1]). snRNA-seq of a VGLL1-fused tumor indicated VGLL1 upregulation in 28.6% of tumor cells (n = 1). During a median follow-up of 1.8 years (range 3 months-9 years), none of the tumors recurred (n = 10). We identify and define a new benign tumor class, designated VGLL-altered intraparenchymal CNS schwannomas. These tumors feature VGLL alterations and a specific DNA-methylation profile, with schwannoma-like histopathology and CNS localization, akin to previously classified intracerebral schwannomas."

    "abstract": "Human aging affects the ability to remember new experiences, in part, because of altered neural function during memory formation. One potential contributor to age-related memory decline is diminished neural selectivity -- i.e., a decline in the differential response of cortical regions to preferred vs. non-preferred stimuli during event perception -- yet the factors driving variability in neural selectivity with age remain unclear. We examined the impact of top-down attention and preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology on neural selectivity during memory encoding in 156 cognitively unimpaired older participants who underwent fMRI while performing a word-face and word-scene associative memory task. Neural selectivity in face- and place-selective cortical regions was greater during events that were later remembered compared to forgotten. Critically, neural selectivity during learning positively scaled with memory-related variability in top-down attention, whereas selectivity negatively related to early AD pathology, evidenced by elevated plasma pTau<sub>181</sub>. Path analysis revealed that neural selectivity at encoding mediated the effects of age, top-down attention, and pTau<sub>181</sub> on associative memory. Collectively, these data reveal multiple pathways that contribute to memory differences among older adults -- AD-independent reductions in top-down attention and AD-related pathology alter the precision of cortical representations of events during experience, with consequences for remembering."

Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging data from nine well-established longitudinal cohorts of aging were free water (FW)-corrected and harmonized. This dataset included 4741 participants (age = 73.06 Â± 9.75) with 9671 imaging sessions over time. FW and FW-corrected fractional anisotropy (FA<sub>FWcorr</sub>) were used to assess differences in white matter microstructure by sex and APOE Îµ4 carrier status. Sex differences in FA<sub>FWcorr</sub> in projection tracts and APOE Îµ4 differences in FW limbic and occipital transcallosal tracts were most pronounced. There are prominent differences in white matter microstructure by sex and APOE Îµ4 carrier status. This work adds to our understanding of disparities in AD. Additional work to understand the etiology of these differences is warranted. Sex and apolipoprotein E (APOE) Îµ4 carrier status relate to white matter microstructural integrity.

Placental insufficiency is a leading cause of FGR, resulting in reduced nutrient and oxygen delivery to the fetus. Currently, there are no effective in utero treatment options for FGR, or placental insufficiency. We have developed a gene therapy to deliver, via a non-viral nanoparticle, human insulin-like 1 growth factor (hIGF1) to the placenta as a potential treatment for placenta insufficiency and FGR. Using a guinea pig maternal nutrient restriction (MNR) model of FGR, we aimed to understand the transcriptional changes within the placenta associated with placental insufficiency that occur prior to/at initiation of FGR, and the impact of short-term hIGF1 nanoparticle treatment. Using RNAsequencing, we analyzed protein coding genes of three experimental groups: Control and MNR dams receiving a sham treatment, and MNR dams receiving hIGF1 nanoparticle treatment. Pathway enrichment analysis comparing differentially expressed genelists in sham-treated MNR placentas to sham-treated Control revealed upregulation of pathways associated with degradation and repair of genetic information and downregulation of pathways associated with transmembrane transport. When compared to sham-treated MNR placentas, MNR + hIGF1 placentas demonstrated changes to genelists associated with transmembrane transporter activity including ion, vitamin and solute carrier transport. Overall, this study identifies the key signaling and metabolic changes occurring in the placenta contributing to placental insufficiency prior to/at initiation of FGR, and increases our understanding of the pathways that our nanoparticle-mediated gene therapy intervention regulates."

    "abstract": "Substance use disorder (SUD) continues to be one of the most stigmatized and under-treated conditions in the United States. Stigmatizing language used by healthcare workers can transmit bias to others within healthcare, including medical trainees. This study investigates how stigmatizing language and undergraduate medical education (UME) curricula may influence trainees' clinical decision-making for patients with SUD. Medical students from three Chicago-area medical schools were randomized to review either a stigmatizing or neutral version of a clinical scenario describing a patient experiencing opioid withdrawal. Participants (a) selected treatment plans for the fictional patient using two multiple-choice questions, (b) completed the Medical Condition Regard Scale (MCRS) to assess their attitudes, and (c) reported prior SUD experiences, both curricular and personal. Statistical analyses explored whether treatment decisions were influenced by attitudes, addiction medicine curricula, and exposure to the stigmatizing vignette. Among the 366 medical students who completed this study, exposure to stigmatizing language (n = 191) led to clinical decision-making that would be less effective in treating opioid withdrawal for the fictional patient (p = 0.027; Î·2 = 0.013). Exposure to more SUD education during UME was correlated with more effective clinical decision-making for opioid withdrawal (Î² = 0.181; R<sup>2</sup> = 0.033; p < 0.001) but was not correlated with attitudes toward patients with SUD (p = 0.231). Stigmatizing language influences clinical decision-making when treating patients with SUD.

Guselkumab is a dual-acting, human IgG1, interleukin-23p19 subunit inhibitor that potently neutralises interleukin-23 and can bind to CD64. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of guselkumab as induction and maintenance therapy in patients with ulcerative colitis. The primary populations of these two phase 3, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (QUASAR phase 3 induction and maintenance) included randomised and treated adults with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (induction baseline modified Mayo score from 5 to 9) with inadequate response or intolerance to conventional or advanced ulcerative colitis therapy. Patients were randomly assigned (3:2) to receive guselkumab 200 mg given intravenously or placebo at weeks 0, 4, and 8 (phase 3 induction study). All patients were randomly assigned using web-based interactive response technology. Patients in clinical response 12 weeks after guselkumab induction given intravenously (from QUASAR phase 2b and phase 3 induction studies) were randomly assigned (1:1:1) at maintenance week 0 to guselkumab 200 mg given subcutaneously every 4 weeks or 100 mg every 8 weeks or placebo for 44 weeks (maintenance). Primary endpoints were clinical remission at induction week 12 and maintenance week 44. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04033445. The induction study primary population included 701 patients (guselkumab 200 mg given intravenously 60% [421 patients]; placebo 40% [280 patients]). The maintenance study primary population included 568 guselkumab induction responders randomly assigned to receive guselkumab 200 mg given subcutaneously every 4 weeks (190 [33%] patients) or 100 mg every 8 weeks (188 [33%] patients) or placebo (guselkumab withdrawal 190 [33%] patients). A significantly greater proportion of patients treated with guselkumab given intravenously had clinical remission at induction week 12 (23% [95 of 421 patients]) than did placebo-treated patients (8% [22 of 280 patients]; adjusted treatment difference 15%, 95% CI 10-20; p<0Â·0001). Clinical remission at maintenance week 44 was achieved by a significantly greater proportion of patients treated with guselkumab 200 mg given subcutaneously every 4 weeks (50% [95 of 190 patients]; adjusted treatment difference 30%, 95% CI 21-38; p<0Â·0001) and 100 mg every 8 weeks (45% [85 of 188 patients]; adjusted treatment difference 25%, 16-34; p<0Â·0001) than with placebo (19% [36 of 190 patients]). The overall safety profile was favourable and consistent with that of guselkumab in approved indications. In the induction study, adverse events were reported by 49% of patients in both groups (208 of 421 guselkumab-treated patients and 138 of 280 placebo-treated patients), serious adverse events were reported by 3% (12 of 421) of guselkumab-treated patients and 7% (20 of 280) of placebo-treated patients, and adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation were reported by 2% (seven of 421) of guselkumab-treated patients and 4% (11 of 280) of placebo-treated patients. In the maintenance study, adverse event rates were similar among groups, and the most frequently reported adverse events in all groups were ulcerative colitis, COVID-19, and arthralgia. No active tuberculosis, anaphylaxis, serum sickness, or clinically important hepatic disorders were reported in either study. Guselkumab was effective and safe as induction and maintenance therapy in patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis. Janssen Research and Development."

We recently reported that the endothelial-specific knockout of <i>KrÃ¼ppel-like factor 4 (Klf4)</i> increases the susceptibility to GEnC injury and subsequent development of subacute thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). However, the mechanism(s) mediating GEnCs response to injury in TMA are poorly understood. Single-nucleus RNA-sequencing demonstrated enrichment in pathways involved in angiogenesis, permeability, focal adhesion, dedifferentiation, and cytoskeletal organization in the endothelial cluster in mice with TMA. <i>Plasmalemmal vesicle-associated protein (Plvap)</i>, a structural component of fenestral diaphragms, was highly enriched specifically in injured GEnCs. Induction of <i>Plvap</i> in cultured GEnCs increased proliferation, migration, and cell permeability with an accompanying loss of mature GEnC markers. Immunostaining for PLVAP in human kidney biopsies confirmed the increase in glomerular PLVAP in TMA, which correlated with a higher grade of glomerular injury. To date, this is the first study to show that the induction of <i>Plvap</i> in GEnCs shifts the cells to an immature state, which might exacerbate glomerular injury in TMA.<b>NEW & NOTEWORTHY</b> This study investigated the mechanism(s) underlying glomerular endothelial cell (GEnC) injury in thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA).

    "abstract": "Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a risk factor for cholangiocarcinoma. When a child is diagnosed with both PSC and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), evidence-based information on counseling families and risk management of developing cholangiocarcinoma is limited. In this case series (PubMed/collaborators), we included patients with PSC-IBD who developed cholangiocarcinoma and contacted authors to determine an event curve specifying the time between the second diagnosis (IBD or PSC) and a diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma. Review of n = 175 studies resulted in a cohort of n = 21 patients with pediatric-onset PSC-IBD-cholangiocarcinoma. The median time to development of cholangiocarcinoma was 6.95 years from the second diagnosis. Despite the small number, 38% of cholangiocarcinoma developed within the first 2 years, and 47% of patients developed cholangiocarcinoma in the transition period to adult care (age 14-25). Our findings highlight the importance of screening that extends over the so-called transition period from pediatric to adult care."

    "abstract": "While countries' coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emergency contingency and response plans aimed to prevent and control the spread of the virus, they also caused major disruptions to health services. We assessed the effects of COVID-19 on coverage and inequalities in select maternal, newborn, and child health services in Burkina Faso. We analysed data from two cross-sectional household surveys conducted in two provinces, one rural and one urban. The first survey of 3375 households was conducted immediately before the pandemic (February to March 2020) and the second survey in the same areas two years after the pandemic (May to June 2022) using a similar methodology. We compared the coverage of maternal, newborn, and child health interventions and care-seeking between the two surveys to assess the effects of the pandemic on maternal, newborn, and child health services. Our findings did not show significant disruptions in coverage of antenatal service, postnatal care for mothers and babies, child routine vaccination, and care-seeking for sick children during the pandemic. However, there was a dramatic drop of the number of women (23 percentage points) accompanied by their partners for delivery as well as the number of caesarean-section deliveries in urban areas. The shortage of health staff, facility congestion, fear of getting COVID-19 after a caesarean-section admission, and prioritisation of critical health services such as emergency caesarean-section to the detriment of elective cases may explain the decline of caesarean-section rates. COVID-19 did not cause major reversals in the coverage of maternal, newborn, and child health services in Burkina Faso, except for caesarean sections. We also saw no substantial increases in service coverage. In the absence of a counterfactual, we could not attribute the stagnation to the pandemic. However, the very low proportion of women reporting disruption in care-seeking suggests some resilience of the health systems to mitigate the negative impacts of the pandemic."

    "title": "Mildly Elevated Liver Transaminase Levels: Causes and Evaluation.",
    "abstract": "Approximately 10% to 20% of the general population has elevated liver chemistry levels, including aspartate and alanine transaminases. Elevated transaminase levels may be associated with significant underlying liver disease and increased risk of liver-related and all-cause mortality. The most common causes of mildly elevated transaminase levels (two to five times the upper limit of normal) are metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) and alcoholic liver disease. Uncommon causes include drug-induced liver injury, chronic hepatitis B and C, and hereditary hemochromatosis. Rare causes are alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency, autoimmune hepatitis, and Wilson disease. Extrahepatic causes are celiac disease, hyperthyroidism, rhabdomyolysis, and pregnancy-associated liver disease. Initial laboratory testing assesses complete blood cell count with platelets, blood glucose, lipid profile, hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C antibody, serum albumin, iron, total iron-binding capacity, and ferritin. If MASLD is suspected, the FIB-4 Index Score or NAFLD Fibrosis Score can be used to predict which patients are at risk for fibrosis and may benefit from further testing or referral to a hepatologist. All patients with elevated transaminases should be counseled about moderation or cessation of alcohol use, weight loss, and avoidance of hepatotoxic drugs."

The genetic and nongenetic factors associated with uUMOD in African populations remain unknown. Clinical parameters, 3 selected <i>UMOD-PDILT</i> SNPs and uUMOD levels were obtained in 1202 young Black and White adults from the African-PREDICT study and 1943 middle aged Black adults from the PURE-NWP-SA study, 2 cross-sectional, observational studies. Absolute uUMOD and uUMOD/creatinine levels were lower in Black participants compared to White participants. The prime CKD-risk allele at rs12917707 was more prevalent in Black individuals, with strikingly more risk allele homozygotes compared to White individuals. Haplotype analysis of the <i>UMOD-PDILT</i> locus predicted more recombination events and linkage disequilibrium (LD) fragmentation in Black individuals. Multivariate testing and sensitivity analysis showed that higher uUMOD/creatinine associated specifically with risk alleles at rs12917707 and rs12446492 in White participants and with higher serum renin and lower urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio in Black participants, with a significant interaction of ethnicity on the relationship between all 3 SNPs and uUMOD/creatinine. The multiple regression model explained a greater percentage of the variance of uUMOD/creatinine in White adults compared to Black adults (23% vs. 8%). We evidenced ethnic differences in clinical and genetic determinants of uUMOD levels, in particular an interaction of ethnicity on the relationship between CKD-risk SNPs and uUMOD. These differences should be considered when analyzing the role of uromodulin in kidney function, interpreting genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and precision medicine recommendations."

    "abstract": "Our primary focus was Schistosoma mansoni infection and schoolchildren. Within communities the social environment may promote individual risk of infection for the school-aged children. There will also be demographic groups who are not targeted or reached by preventive chemotherapy campaigns. The behaviours of these other groups will interact with those of school-aged children, resulting in further infection risk through exposure-related behaviours. Furthermore, perception of the disease may significantly influence the schoolchildren's lived experience of the infection and associated disease. It is therefore crucial to document the daily experiences of schoolchildren living in schistosomiasis high transmission areas along Lake Albert, Hoima District. An ethnographic study explored schoolchildren's perspectives and daily life organisations that shape their risk of schistosomiaisis and their perceptions of the disease. The study was conducted between November 2022 and August 2023. It involved in-depth interviews with schoolchildren and their parents, key informant interviews, focus group discussions with schoolchildren, and participant observations. Data was analysed using a reflexive thematic analysis. Code reports were generated inductively using ATLAS.ti (Version 7). The study revealed a significant level of knowledge and awareness about schistosomiasis among schoolchildren. They had understanding of the risk factors, continued exposure, and experiences of illness, though they had little autonomy to address these through their own behaviour as they were influenced by the behaviour of others and macro-factors such as WASH provision and economic need. Study participants experienced individual-level effects of schistosomiasis such as educational impacts and isolation as a significant form of stigma. There is a need for continued community sensitisation and awareness campaigns to address social stigma, educational impact, and contamination and exposure-related behaviours. National and regional policies and programmes on WASH, livelihood and poverty eradication programmes need to be revisited in schistosomiasis high transmission areas to help provide alternatives and improve schoolchildren's lived experiences.

The main outcome measures were the incidence and cumulative risk of systemic metastasis, study mortality rates and Kaplan-Meier patient mortality after developing conjunctival melanoma metastasis. Of 288 patients, 29 developed metastasis. Five had metastasis at presentation, were American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) cT3-category and exhibited tumour-surface ulceration. Four of five (80%) had melanotic tumours with plical and/or caruncular involvement and died within 1 year. One survived 21 months. In contrast, 24 developed metastases during follow-up (mean 4.6Â±3.2 years). Their primary tumours were cT1 (n=13/24, 54.1%), cT2 (n=6/24, 25%), cT3 (n=2/24, 8.3%) and 3 cTx (12.5%) at presentation. Death had occurred in 17 patients (n=17/24, 71%) by the end of the study. The cumulative risk of systemic metastasis after treatment was 0.4% (95% CI 0.6% to 2.9%) at 1 year, 8.6% (95% CI 5.1% to 14.3%) at 5 years and 22.3% (95% CI 14.5% to 33.5%) at 10 years. Each increase in AJCC cT category was associated with an 89% higher risk for metastasis (HR=1.89, p<0.001). Among all 29 patients who developed metastasis, those who presented with AJCC cT3 disease were at highest risk (p<0.001). Liver and lung (n=13 each) were the most reported metastatic sites. Metastatic conjunctival melanoma was found in 10% of conjunctival melanoma patients. Tumour-specific characteristics including AJCC cT3-category, conjunctival location and surface ulceration were associated with metastatic risk. Survival durations were shorter for those presenting with metastasis."

This study assesses the cost-effectiveness of LTP compared with ODT in patients with VWD treated with Voncento in the United Kingdom. A Markov structure was developed to estimate the quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs of VWD treatment over a lifetime horizon. Treatment options included ODT or LTP. For both options, we assumed plasma-derived VWF/factor VIII 2.4:1 (Voncento) as the VWF product used. Clinical parameters were obtained from published literature and Voncento's summary characteristics. Utility weights were obtained from published literature. Costs (in 2021 GBP [Â£]) and outcomes were discounted annually by 3.5%. Sensitivity analyses were conducted. Three baseline annual bleed rate (ABR) scenarios (11, 26.5, and 39.6) were considered. In the base-case analyses, Voncento LTP resulted in lower costs (-Â£831 206) and greater QALYs (6.14) vs ODT. Savings were primarily due to reductions in product use required (-Â£529 571) and bleed-related other medical costs (-Â£301 352). Compared with ODT, LTP also resulted in 322.52 fewer major bleeds and 515.68 fewer minor bleeds over a lifetime horizon. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses showed dominance in 96.12% of simulations and cost-effectiveness in 97.68% of simulations. For the 39.6 ABR scenario also, LTP was dominant compared with ODT. Results suggest that Voncento LTP is more effective and cost saving than ODT in the United Kingdom for patients with VWD with higher ABR. Prophylaxis for patients with frequent bleeds is likely to be a cost-saving and effective strategy."

    "abstract": "Tissue inflammation is often broadly associated with cellular damage, yet sterile inflammation also plays critical roles in beneficial tissue remodeling. In the central nervous system, this is observed through a predominantly innate immune response in retinal vascular diseases such as age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, and retinopathy of prematurity. Here, we set out to elucidate the dynamics of the immune response during progression and regression of pathological neovascularization in retinopathy. In a mouse model of oxygen-induced retinopathy, we report that dexamethasone, a broad-spectrum corticosteroid, suppresses initial formation of pathological preretinal neovascularization in early stages of disease, yet blunts reparative inflammation by impairing distinct myeloid cell populations, and hence reduces beneficial vascular remodeling in later stages of disease. Using genetic depletion of distinct components of the innate immune response, we demonstrate that CX3C chemokine receptor 1-expressing microglia contribute to angiogenesis. Conversely, myeloid cells expressing lysozyme 2 are recruited to sites of damaged blood vessels and pathological neovascularization where they partake in a reparative process that ultimately restores circulatory homeostasis to the retina. Hence, the Janus-faced properties of anti-inflammatory drugs should be considered, particularly in stages associated with persistent neovascularization."

Yet, biomarkers to reliably identify RA patients with underlying pulmonary fibrosis are inadequate. Herein, we used sputum to identify lung-based biomarkers that distinguish RA patients with underlying pulmonary fibrosis and may better inform underlying pathogenesis in RA-ILD. We included 37 RA patients with pulmonary fibrosis (RA-PF) and 30 RA patients without ILD (RA-no-ILD). Induced sputum and serum were tested for TGF-Î² levels by immunoassay. DNA was extracted to determine presence of the MUC5B ILD-risk allele ('T'). High-resolution CT (HRCT) and pulmonary function tests (PFTs) were completed within 3 months of sputum collection and quantified to determine lung disease severity. Sputum TGF-Î² was significantly elevated in individuals with RA-PF compared with RA-no-ILD (P < 0.001) and correlated with more fibrosis on HRCT (P = 0.005) and lower forced vital capacity (P = 0.006) and diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide (P = 0.044) on PFTs. Within RA-PF patients, sputum TGF-Î² was higher in those with the MUC5B ILD-risk genotype (GT/TT) (P = 0.038). There were no differences in serum levels of TGF-Î² between groups. We demonstrate that sputum levels of TGF-Î² are significantly elevated in individuals with RA-PF, correlate with lung disease severity, and are elevated in those with the MUC5B ILD-risk polymorphism. These findings could identify novel approaches to ILD screening in RA and potential targeted therapeutic strategies for RA-ILD."

An observational registry study utilizing the US APEX COPD registry, composed of patients diagnosed with COPD aged 35+ years. Demographic and clinical data were collected from EHRs and complemented by questionnaires. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to assess whether PRISm predicts lung function decline.

Herein, we report a series of morpholine-anchored fluorescent probes, denoted as SC-nmor (n = 2, 4, 6), designed for facile visualization of protein aggregates. These probes display notable changes in their photophysical properties upon binding with protein aggregates, owing to their high sensitivity to the fibrillar microenvironment. Specifically, the SC-4mor probe demonstrates strong selectivity for aggregated insulin proteins over native insulin, accompanied by a significant enhancement in fluorescence lifetime. Live-cell imaging reveals an exclusive localization at the lysosomal compartment. This feature enables the visualization of lysosomal accumulated protein fibrils induced with pepstatin A. Additionally, in vivo assessments on genetically mutated and dietary-modified Drosophila melanogaster, representing neurodegenerative and non-neurodegenerative disease models, demonstrate staining of protein aggregates. The enhanced emission from the eye lobes of AÎ²-mutated and HSD brain samples, suggesting that SC-4mor can exhibit adequate retention in the brain with minimal biological toxicity. SC-4mor also shows its capability to cross the blood-brain barrier in mice model. Consequently, SC-4mor emerges as a promising marker for detecting and monitoring neurotoxic protein fibrillation in live cells and animal models, offering potential insights into the pathogenesis and progression of protein aggregation."

Among chronic coronary disease participants with site-determined moderate or severe ischemia, we investigated associations between ischemia severity on stress testing and the extent of CAD on coronary computed tomography angiography. Clinically indicated stress testing included nuclear imaging, echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, or nonimaging exercise tolerance test. Among those with preserved renal function who underwent coronary computed tomography angiography, we examined relationships between ischemia and CAD by coronary computed tomography angiography, overall, and by stress test modality, regardless of subsequent randomization. Core laboratories categorized ischemia as severe, moderate, mild, or none, while the extent and severity of anatomic CAD were categorized based on the modified Duke prognostic index. Among 3601 participants with interpretable stress tests and coronary computed tomography angiography, ischemia severity was weakly associated with CAD extent/severity (r=0.27), with modest variability in strength of association by modality: nuclear (n=1532; r=0.40), echocardiography (n=827; r=0.15), cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (n=108; r=0.31), and exercise tolerance test (n=1134; r=0.18).

Emerging research has highlighted ferroptosis (FPT) as a distinct type of programmed cell death, potentially linked to various cognitive dysfunctions. Nevertheless, the connection between FPT and cognitive impairment in Wilson's disease (WDCI) remains largely enigmatic. In our study, we utilized a multifaceted approach, combining reverse network pharmacology, data mining, and molecular docking techniques to explore the potential for treating WDCI via FPT-related pathways. This thorough analysis revealed a series of proteins, including P38[Formula: see text], GSK3[Formula: see text], P53, GPX4, and PTGS2, as pivotal targets for WDCI treatment. Notably, Diosgenin (DG) has been identified as a prospective core component in this therapeutic framework. In the WD copper-loaded rat model, evaluations using the Morris water maze (MWM), Y maze, hematoxylin and eosin staining, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and immunofluorescence (IF) detection showed that DG significantly enhanced cognitive function recovery, reduced structural damage to hippocampal neurons, and protected mitochondrial integrity. In addition, Western blot (WB) and quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis showed that DG significantly upregulated the expression levels of proteins and mRNA such as P38[Formula: see text], GSK3[Formula: see text], P53, GPX4, and PTGS2 in animal and cell models. Furthermore, DG effectively reversed the dysregulated expression of oxidative stress markers, including [Formula: see text], malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and reactive oxygen species (ROS). This study elucidates the neuroprotective effect of DG on hippocampal neurons by activating the P38[Formula: see text]-mediated FPT pathway, highlighting its efficacy as a potent monomer in traditional Chinese medicine and illuminating its potential role in the clinical treatment of WDCI."

A total of 34 individuals with sleep issues and overweight or obesity (BMI: 32.1 Â± 7.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) were recruited to this randomized controlled, crossover study. MTC capsules (500 mg) or a placebo were taken one hour before bed for 14 days. Sleep outcomes including total sleep time, deep and REM sleep duration, nap duration, and nocturnal sleep duration were assessed using the Zmachine and/or Fitbit Inspire 3. Subjective sleep information on quality and insomnia symptoms was collected using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, the Sleep Quality Scale, and the Insomnia Severity Index. Markers of inflammation included C-reactive protein, TNF-Î±, and IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and IL-17A. No significant effects of MTC supplementation were observed for any of the measures of interest (<i>p</i> > 0.05 for all). These results suggest studies of individuals with overweight and obesity should test higher doses of MTC than those currently recommended."

    "title": "The effects of rain and drought on incidence of enteric disease in Pennsylvania (2010-2019).",
    "abstract": "Campylobacter, nontyphoidal Salmonella, Cryptosporidium, and Giardia cause an estimated 1 million cases of domestically acquired waterborne diseases annually in the United States. Acute symptoms can include diarrhea and vomiting; however, these illnesses can result in longer term complications such as reactive arthritis, Guillan BarrÃ© syndrome and death, particularly in immunocompromised individuals. Precipitation and drought can plausibly increase the risk of enteric infections, but consensus in the literature is lacking. To determine the effects of rain and drought on weekly counts of reportable enteric illness (due to Salmonella, Campylobacter, Giardia, or Cryptosporidium) in Pennsylvania, US between 2010 and 2019. We obtained 10-years of data on confirmed illness from 66 Pennsylvania counties due to: Salmonella (9,924), Campylobacter (15,854), Giardia (4,537), and Cryptosporidium (4,017). A zero-inflated negative binomial model with random-intercept for county was used to assess the relationship between illnesses caused by these pathogens between 2010 and 2019, and weekly rain (cm) and Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) values from the National Weather Service. The lag times that were tested, between illness and weather event, were chosen by calculating the cross correlation between the statewide average weekly rain and the statewide number of weekly cases. A positive association was found between rain and counts of campylobacteriosis, salmonellosis, and giardiasis. An increase in prior wetness (PDSI value) was associated with increased incidence rates of cryptosporidiosis and campylobacteriosis. The relationship between rain and PDSI and illness varied by organism type. Complex relationships exist between enteric disease and precipitation and prior environmental wetness. Our findings suggest that rainfall may be contributing to increased waterborne exposure. Further investigation is needed to explore these relationships with factors such as drinking water source, local geological conditions, presence of combined sewer overflows and agricultural activities, recreational water use and irrigation water sources to better elucidate important waterborne transmission pathways."

    "title": "Cell Type Differentiation Using Network Clustering Algorithms.",
    "abstract": "Single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) technologies provide unprecedented resolution representing transcriptomics at the level of single cell. One of the biggest challenges in scRNA-seq data analysis is the cell type annotation, which is usually inferred by cell separation approaches. In-silico algorithms that accurately identify individual cell types in ongoing single-cell sequencing studies are crucial for unlocking cellular heterogeneity and understanding the biological basis of diseases. In this study, we focus on robustly identifying cell types in single-cell RNA sequencing data; we conduct a comparative analysis using methods established in biology, like Seurat, Leiden, and WGCNA, as well as Infomap, statistical inference via Stochastic Block Models (SBM), and single-cell Graph Neural Networks (scGNN). We also analyze preprocessing pipelines to identify and optimize key components in the process. Leveraging two independent datasets, PBMC and ROSMAP, we employ clustering algorithms on cell-cell networks derived from gene expression data. Our findings reveal that while clusters detected by WGCNA exhibit limited correspondence with cell types, those identified by multiresolution Infomap and Leiden, and SBM show a closer alignment, with Infomap standing out as a particularly effective approach. Infomap notably offers valuable insights for the precise characterization of cellular landscapes related to neurodegenration and immunology in scRNA-seq."

    "abstract": "This review summarises advances in research from Aotearoa, New Zealand (NZ) that have potential to reduce the inequitable distribution of acute rheumatic fever (ARF) and rheumatic heart disease (RHD). ARF incidence and RHD prevalence are unacceptably inequitable for MÄori and Pacifica. Recent qualitative research has demonstrated mismatches between the lived experience of those with ARF/RHD and health service experience they encounter. NZ-led research has contributed knowledge to all stages of disease prevention (primordial, primary and secondary) and for tertiary management. Modifiable risk factors for ARF are racism across health sectors, household crowding, barriers to accessing primary health care, a high intake of sugar-sweetened beverages and preceding sore throat and skin infections. NZ research has evaluated the impact of a large-scale sore throat management programme and Streptococcal A vaccine development. This review highlights two programme domains of research by the authors that have the potential to reduce the burden of chronic RHD: firstly, effective immunomodulation of ARF to reduce the severity of carditis, with current clinical trials of hydroxychloroquine in NZ; secondly, the development of echocardiographic screening of previously undetected RHD. This now meets criteria for an effective screening test and has potential translation for disease control of RHD."

As part of a randomized trial comparing enhanced care planning versus usual care, we evaluated what risks patients wanted to address. All patients with multiple chronic conditions, 1 or more of which was uncontrolled, from 81 clinicians in 30 primary care practices. Using My Own Health Report (MOHR), patients identified and prioritized their health risks to create a care plan. All patients had at least 1 unhealthy behavior (100%) and most had a mental health risk (66.8%) and a social need (51.3%). Participants more often chose to create care plans addressing unhealthy behaviors (92.5%) rather than mental health (23.2%), or social needs (12.5%). The most frequently created care plans were for exercise (65.1%), weight loss (37.2%), and nutrition (36.2%). All patients had 1 or more unhealthy behaviors, mental health risks, or social needs, and were more likely to address health behaviors. We need to better understand these patient choices, and change the culture to normalize the integration of mental health and social care into primary care."

    "abstract": "Long-standing inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) increases the risk of colonic neoplasia, necessitating effective screening strategies. This network meta-analysis compared the efficacy and safety between different endoscopic modalities in the high-definition (HD) era. We searched CENTRAL, ClinicalTrials.gov, Embase, MEDLINE, and WHO for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing endoscopic modalities for screening colonoscopy in patients with IBD up to February 2024. The primary outcome was detection of any dysplastic lesion per patient. The certainty of the evidence was GRADE-assessed. A total of 26 RCTs involving 4159 participants were included, comparing 6 endoscopic modalities: HD white light endoscopy (HD-WLE), HD virtual chromoendoscopy (HD-VCE), HD dye-based chromoendoscopy (HD-DCE), HD-WLE with segmental re-inspection (SR), auto-fluorescence imaging (AFI), and full-spectrum endoscopy (FUSE). HD-DCE may have a small benefit in detecting dysplasia over HD-WLE (low certainty, small magnitude;: relative risk [RR], 1.42; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-1.98). FUSE may be no different to HD-WLE (low certainty: RR, 3.24; 95% CI, 0.66-15.87). The other modalities were assessed as very low certainty (HD-WLE with SR: RR, 1.35; 95% CI, 0.66-2.77; AFI: RR, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.55-2.57; HD-VCE: RR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.69-1.43). Sensitivity analyses supported these findings. Limited data on serious adverse events precluded meta-analysis; 2 serious events were reported among 2164 patients (very low certainty). HD-DCE is the only modality for IBD surveillance with evidence (low-certainty) demonstrating potential to detect more dysplastic lesions compared with HD-WLE. There was no evidence to support any of the other modalities as an alternative due to very low-certainty evidence."

    "abstract": "Bubble continuous positive airway pressure (bCPAP) is a low-cost, non-invasive respiratory support therapy for children with respiratory distress, but its effectiveness is dependent on the context. We aimed to understand contextual factors influencing bCPAP implementation for children aged 1-59 months in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) and to develop a theory explaining how these factors influence implementation outcomes. In this realist review, we generated an initial programme theory comprising candidate context-mechanism-outcome configurations (CMOCs) via review of key references and team discussion. On July 25, 2023, we conducted a search for peer-reviewed and grey literature, without date restrictions, describing bCPAP use for paediatric respiratory distress in LMICs. We included references describing related contexts, mechanisms, or outcomes. We coded statements from the literature supporting each CMOC, iteratively revising and adding CMOCs using inductive and deductive logic. We assembled an international, interdisciplinary panel of 22 bCPAP stakeholders to refine CMOCs using iterative surveys, focus groups, and interviews until we reached thematic saturation. This realist review is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42023403584). Of 1640 peer-reviewed references and eight grey literature references retrieved, 38 peer-reviewed articles and two grey literature documents were deemed eligible for inclusion after removal of duplicates and screening. After four rounds of expert surveys and three focus groups, we identified 18 CMOCs. CMOCs were synthesised into a final programme theory operating at five levels to influence implementation feasibility, fidelity, and sustainability: (1) the bCPAP device, (2) local partnerships and infrastructure, (3) clinical and technical teams, (4) caregivers and the community, and (5) institutional practices. Using realist methods with a diverse, international stakeholder panel, we generated a theory that could explain how bCPAP therapy works in different contexts. This theory could be leveraged to enhance the rigour of future bCPAP implementation trials.

    "abstract": "Population-based biobanks enable genomic screening to support initiatives that prevent disease onset or slow its progression and to estimate the prevalence of genetic diseases in the population. Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare genetic copper-accumulation disorder for which timely intervention is crucial, as treatment is readily available. We studied WD in the Estonian Biobank population to advance patient screening, swift diagnosis, and subsequent treatment. Combined analysis of genotype and phenotype data from electronic health records (EHRs) consolidated at the Estonian biobank led to the identification of 17 individuals at high risk of developing WD, who were recalled for further examination and deep phenotyping. All recall study participants, regardless of phenotype, age, and prior WD diagnosis, had low serum ceruloplasmin and copper levels, and 87% also exhibited signs of early to late neurodegeneration. The p.His1069Gln variant in ATP7B, a prevalent pathogenic mutation, showed a striking four- to five-fold enrichment in Estonians compared with other populations. Based on our analysis of genetic and nationwide health registry data, we estimate that WD remains underdiagnosed and undertreated in Estonia. Our study demonstrates that personalized medicine, implemented with the collaboration of medical professionals, has the potential to reduce the healthcare burden by facilitating the accurate diagnosis of rare genetic diseases. To our knowledge, this report is the first to describe a large-scale national biobank-based study of WD."

Participants aged â¥16 years, with new-onset non-specific musculoskeletal symptoms and no history of clinical synovitis, completed a symptom questionnaire and had an anti-CCP test. Model development used LASSO-penalized logistic regression, performance was assessed using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and decision curve analysis, model over-fit was estimated using bootstrapping and cross-validation. Participants were followed-up at 12 months for RA or seronegative/undifferentiated inflammatory arthritis diagnosis. Analysis included 6879 participants; 203 (2.95%) of whom were anti-CCP positive. Eleven predictors were retained: male sex, first-degree relative with RA, ever smoked and joint pain in: back, neck, shoulders, wrists, hands/fingers, thumbs, knees, feet/toes. AUROC was 0.65 (95% CI 0.61, 0.69, optimism = 0.03). Using a 4% decision threshold, the model recommended an anti-CCP test in 1288 (18.7%) participants, 78 (6.1%) of whom were anti-CCP positive, compared with 125/5591 (2.2%) below the threshold. Net benefit was 0.0040 (0.0020 corrected). Forty-eight participants were diagnosed with inflammatory arthritis/RA within 12 months. Of those who were above the threshold and anti-CCP positive, 32.1% developed inflammatory arthritis/RA compared with 0.4% of those who were anti-CCP negative. Of those below the threshold, 0.3% were diagnosed with inflammatory arthritis/RA. Targeted anti-CCP testing in primary care may aid earlier identification of people at risk of RA, prompting specialist referral to rheumatology for earlier diagnosis and initiation of disease-modifying therapy."

    "abstract": "Enteropathogenic <i>Escherichia coli</i> (EPEC) is a bacterium that causes attaching/effacing (A/E) lesions and serious diarrheal disease, a major health issue in developing countries. EPEC pathogenicity results from the effect of virulence factors and dysregulation of host responses. Polyamines, including spermidine, play a major role in intestinal homeostasis. Spermidine is the substrate for deoxyhypusine synthase (DHPS), which catalyzes the conjugation of the amino acid hypusine to eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A (EIF5A); hypusinated EIF5A (EIF5A<sup>Hyp</sup>) binds specific mRNAs and initiates translation. Our aim was to determine the role of hypusination during infection with A/E pathogens. We found that DHPS and EIF5A<sup>Hyp</sup> levels are induced in i) a colonic epithelial cell line and human-derived colon organoids infected with EPEC, and ii) the colon of mice infected with <i>Citrobacter rodentium</i>, the rodent equivalent of EPEC. Specific deletion of <i>Dhps</i> in intestinal epithelial cells worsened clinical, histological, and pro-inflammatory parameters in <i>C. rodentium</i>-infected mice. These animals also exhibited an exacerbated pathogenic transcriptome in their colon. Furthermore, infected mice with specific <i>Dhps</i> deletion exhibited reduced levels of proteins involved in detoxification of tissue-damaging reactive aldehydes and consequently increased electrophile adducts in the colon. Thus, hypusination in intestinal epithelial cells protects from infectious colitis mediated by A/E pathogens."

Genetic interaction of total testosterone, bioavailable testosterone, and SHBG (sex hormone-binding globulin) were evaluated. Gene-environment interactions in millions of samples software was used to conduct sex-stratified genome-wide interaction analysis with prevalent CAD as the outcome.

We identified 45 loci in men and 8 loci in women that reached genome-wide significance (<i>P</i> < 5 Ã 10<sup>-8</sup>) for CAD. Ten of the loci identified (5 loci in both men and women) were through joint effects and would not have been picked up using a traditional genome-wide association study. Two of the joint effect loci in women were independently identified with significant single nucleotide polymorphism-total testosterone interactions. This genome-wide gene-sex hormone interaction study identified genomic-risk loci that may contribute to the differential CAD risk between men and women, which otherwise would not have been discovered in a traditional genome-wide association study solely including marginal genetic effects."

This study aimed to identify urinary protein biomarkers for WD using targeted and nontargeted mass spectrometry-based approaches. Exploratory urinary proteomic research on WD patients was initially conducted and revealed some potential biomarkers (alpha-2-macroglobulin, alpha-1-antitrypsin, complement C3, prothrombin, and complement factor B). A multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) assay was subsequently developed and applied to an independent WD cohort for protein candidate validation. Finally, a Random Forest (RF) model constructed with five proteins was evaluated for its diagnostic capacity. The linear range of the MRM assay extended from 0.025 ng/L to 155 ng/L and the limit of quantification (LOQ) ranged from 0.0095 ng/L to 9.2308 ng/L. Alpha-2-macroglobulin, alpha-1-antitrypsin, and complement C3 exhibited significant increases (p < 0.05) in WD patients compared to the controls, whereas prothrombin and complement factor B only showed variations in concentration. The physiology reference intervals (RIs) for alpha-2-macroglobulin, alpha-1-antitrypsin, complement C3, prothrombin, and complement factor B were estimated as 0-12.50, 0-123.08, 0-5.20, 0-16.59, 0-4.85 ng/mol Cr, while the pathology RIs were 0-114.86, 0-600.98, 0-12.62, 0-22.16, and 0-10.83 ng/mol Cr, respectively. The RF model demonstrated an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.99 for the training data and 0.83 for the testing data.

    "abstract": "The WHO Neglected Tropical Disease Roadmap for 2021-2030 includes the goal of eliminating schistosomiasis as a public health problem in all endemic countries. Despite heightened efforts since 2012, critical action is still required in addressing barriers to Mass Drug Administration, the primary control method. This includes improvement in adherence by the populations in persistent schistosomiasis hotspots. One such hotspot is the shoreline of Lake Albert, Uganda, where schistosomiasis control is provided to school-aged children and adults. An overemphasis on regular treatment, without comprehensively addressing factors that result in low uptake of treatment in these high-risk populations is likely to impact the elimination of schistosomiasis as a public health problem. An ethnographic study using in-depth interviews, key informant interviews, focus group discussions and participant observation was conducted at two study sites along Lake Albert. Thematic content analysis was used during data analysis. The study revealed that the size, taste and smell of the drug, along with its side-effects; poor community integration and occupational behaviour resulting in non-mobilisation; and unfounded rumours and beliefs remain reasons for persistent low uptake of praziquantel by some. Conversely, lived experience of improved health through participation and knowledge of the dangers of the disease if not treated, facilitated treatment uptake. Positive attitudes to localised sensitisation by community drug distributors show social influence facilitates crucial knowledge attainment. Treatment uptake is further facilitated by the delivery of the drug at no cost at home. Crucially, for the majority of participants the facilitating factors were found to outweigh the inhibitory factors related to the drug's side effects. We recommend a good community engagement strategy that provides continuous education and sensitisation, with improved recruitment and training provision for Community Drug Distributors to facilitate programme reach to groups with current poor engagement."

    "abstract": "The 2021 ECCO-ESPGHAN guideline on the medical management of pediatric Crohn's disease promotes early risk stratification and top-down anti-TNF for patients deemed high risk of severe disease course. We aimed to objectively assess the risk-benefit profile of the guideline's risk stratification policy and guidance on top-down anti-TNF in a nationwide population-based cohort study. Using a prospectively identified nationwide cohort of all new pediatric patients (<17 years) diagnosed with Crohn's disease in Scotland between January 1, 2016 and December 31, 2020 and retrospectively applying the current management algorithm, we explored the guideline's ability to accurately risk stratify patients. Phenotypic and treatment data were retrospectively collected from electronic medical records with a maximum follow-up of 18 months post-diagnosis. Four hundred and eighteen children (258/418 [62%] male; median [interquartile range {IQR}] age at diagnosis: 13.2 [11.2-14.8] years) were included. High-risk phenotype was present in 224/418 (54%) with 53/224 (24%) of high-risk patients not requiring anti-TNF therapy within 18 months of diagnosis. Conversely, 78/194 (40%) of the low-risk group received anti-TNF within 18 months. High-risk patients were more likely to require anti-TNF (171/224 [76%] vs 78/194 [40%], P < .001) and had shorter median (IQR) time to anti-TNF start (5.0 [1.0-8.0] months vs 6.5 [3.3-13.0] months, P = .01). Our data support the guideline's ability to identify patients more likely to require early treatment escalation. However, this approach would have led to potential over- and under-treatment in a substantial proportion of patients. This underscores the importance of frequent and comprehensive monitoring, along with flexible treatment strategies that adapt to changes in disease status."

Between April 2019 and December 2021, 600 probands meeting cardiovascular disorder criteria from 17 cardiology and genetics clinics across Australia were enrolled in the Flagship and underwent GS. The Flagship adopted a tiered approach to GS analysis. Tier 1 analysis assessed genes with established clinical validity for each cardiovascular condition. Tier 2 analysis assessed lesser-evidenced research-based genes. Tier 3 analysis assessed the functional impact of VUS that remained after tier 1 and tier 2 analysis. Overall, a pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant was identified in 41% of participants with a cardiomyopathy, 40% with an arrhythmia syndrome, and 15% with a familial CHD/CHD+Extra Cardiac Anomalies. A VUS outcome ranged from 13% for arrhythmias to 34% for CHD/CHD+Extra Cardiac Anomalies participants. Tier 2 research analysis identified a likely pathogenic/pathogenic variant for a further 15 participants and a VUS for an additional 15 participants. The Flagship successfully facilitated a model of care that harnesses clinical GS and functional genomics for the resolution of VUS in the clinical setting. This valuable data set can be used to inform clinical practice and facilitate research into the future."

Preventing HIV among PLWMI is a priority for multiple domestic public health agencies. As key clinicians for this group, psychiatrists may have an important role to play in increasing PrEP use among PLWMI. A national survey of psychiatrists (<i>N</i> = 880) about integrating PrEP prescription into psychiatric practice was conducted between November 2022-October 2023. Specifically, we inquired about experiences with PrEP prescription, patient request for PrEP, and interest in prescribing PrEP. We also inquired about barriers to PrEP prescription in psychiatry and preferred models for implementing PrEP prescription in psychiatry. We found that 19.3% of psychiatrists had received a request for PrEP from a patient, 17.3% had prescribed, and 53.9% were interested in prescribing. The greatest percentage of psychiatrists who prescribed PrEP were practicing primarily in inpatient psychiatry (28.8%). Practicing in one of the federal <i>Ending the HIV Epidemic</i> (EHE) priority jurisdictions (aOR = 2.08 [1.23-3.54], <i>p</i> = 0.003) and greater self-confidence in PrEP-related tasks (aOR = 2.10 [1.67-2.65], <i>p</i> < 0.001) were associated with higher likelihood of PrEP prescription.

Most preferred a hypothetical model in which a psychiatrist prescribed an initial course of PrEP with prompt primary care or infectious disease follow-up (63.1%). Most psychiatrists were interested in prescribing PrEP. Training is needed to enable PrEP implementation in psychiatric practice including development of collaborative practice models to engage psychiatrists across a diversity of settings."

    "abstract": "The hyper-unstable Chr9p21 locus, harbouring the interferon gene cluster, oncogenes and <i>C9orf72</i>, is linked to multiple diseases. <i>C9orf72</i> (GGGGCC)n expansions (<i>C9orf72</i>Exp) are associated with incompletely penetrant amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal dementia and autoimmune disorders. <i>C9orf72</i>Exp patients display hyperactive cGAS-STING-linked interferon immune and DNA damage responses, but the source of immunostimulatory or damaged DNA is unknown. Here, we show <i>C9orf72</i>Exp in pre-symptomatic and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-frontotemporal dementia patient cells and brains cause the folate-sensitive chromosomal fragile site, FRA9A. FRA9A centers on >33 kb of <i>C9orf72</i> as highly compacted chromatin embedded in an 8.2 Mb fragility zone spanning 9p21, encompassing 46 genes, making FRA9A one of the largest fragile sites. <i>C9orf72</i>Exp cells show chromosomal instability, heightened global- and Chr9p-enriched sister-chromatid exchanges, truncated-Chr9s, acentric-Chr9s and Chr9-containing micronuclei, providing endogenous sources of damaged and immunostimulatory DNA. Cells from one <i>C9orf72</i>Exp patient contained a highly rearranged FRA9A-expressing Chr9 with Chr9-wide dysregulated gene expression. Somatic <i>C9orf72</i>Exp repeat instability and chromosomal fragility are sensitive to folate deficiency. Age-dependent repeat instability, chromosomal fragility and chromosomal instability can be transferred to CNS and peripheral tissues of transgenic <i>C9orf72</i>Exp mice, implicating <i>C9orf72</i>Exp as the source. Our results highlight unappreciated effects of <i>C9orf72</i> expansions that trigger vitamin-sensitive chromosome fragility, adding structural variations to the disease-enriched 9p21 locus, and likely elsewhere."

    "abstract": "Arthropod-borne members of the genus <i>Orthoflavivirus</i> cause significant human disease. Four serotypes of dengue virus are endemic globally, and approximately 50 percent of the world's population lives in a dengue-affected area. Complications from immunoenhancement occurring after a secondary infection with a different dengue serotype make vaccine development challenging. Antiviral therapies that target features conserved in all four serotypes would, therefore, be beneficial. Computational studies identified multiple potential G-quadruplex sites that are conserved in the RNA genome sequences of members of the genus <i>Orthoflavivirus</i>. Biophysical studies confirmed that the NS5-B quadruplex sequences obtained from viruses of each dengue serotype can form quadruplexes <i>in vitro</i>, and binding data showed that known quadruplex binders stabilized NS5-B quadruplexes for all four dengue serotypes."

    "abstract": "Translation terminates at UAG (amber), UGA (opal), and UAA (ochre) stop codons. In nature, readthrough of stop codons can be substantially enhanced by suppressor tRNAs. Stop-codon suppression also provides powerful tools in synthetic biology and disease treatment. How stop-codon suppression affects bacterial pathogenesis is poorly understood. Here, we show that suppression of UAG codons, but not UGA or UAA codons, attenuates expression of Salmonella Pathogenicity Island 1 (SPI-1) genes, which are required for virulence. Consistently, amber suppression abolishes Salmonella infection of macrophages. Systematic genetic and biochemical analyses further show that amber suppression decreases the activity, but not the level, of the master SPI-1 regulator HilD. Our work thus demonstrates an unexpected selectivity of stop codons in regulating Salmonella virulence."

    "abstract": "Renal osteodystrophy (ROD) leads to increased fractures, potentially due to underlying low bone turnover in chronic kidney disease (CKD). We hypothesized that indoxyl sulfate (IS), a circulating toxin elevated in CKD and a ligand for the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), may target the osteocytes leading to bone cell uncoupling in ROD. The IDG-SW3 osteocytes were cultured for 14 days (early) and 35 days (mature osteocytes) and incubated with 500 Î¼M of IS after dose finding studies to confirm AhR activation. Long-term incubation of IS for 14 days led to decreased expression of Tnfsf11/Tnfrsf11b ratio (RANKL/OPG), which would increase osteoclast activity, and increased expression of Wnt inhibitors Sost and Dkk1, which would decrease bone formation in addition to decreased mineralization and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity. When osteocytes were incubated with IS and the AhR translocation inhibitor CH223191, mineralization and ALP activity were restored. However, the Tnfsf11/Tnfrsf11b ratio and Sost, Dkk1 expression were not altered compared with IS alone, suggesting more complex signaling. In both early and mature osteocytes, co-culture with parathyroid hormone (PTH) and IS reversed the IS-induced upregulation of Sost and Dkk1, and IS enhanced the PTH-induced increase of the Tnfsf11/Tnfrsf11b ratio. Co-culture of IS with PTH additively enhanced the AhR activity assessed by <i>Cyp1a1</i> and <i>Cyp1b1</i> expression. In summary, IS in the absence of PTH increased osteocyte messenger RNA (mRNA) Wnt inhibitor expression in both early and mature osteocytes, decreased mRNA expression ofTnfsf11/Tnfrsf11b ratio and decreased mineralization in early osteocytes. These changes would lead to decreased resorption and formation resulting in low bone remodeling. These data suggest IS may be important in the underlying low turnover bone disease observed in CKD when PTH is not elevated. In addition, when PTH is elevated, IS interacts to further increase Tnfsf11/Tnfrsf11b ratio for osteoclast activity in both early and mature osteocytes, which would worsen bone resorption."

A 22-year-old male presented with a 1-week history of bleeding gums and dizziness. Four months prior, he had been diagnosed with Wilson's disease and started on a regimen of DPA. His blood counts demonstrated profound pancytopenia. Due to concern for suspected drug-induced myelotoxicity, DPA was discontinued. Parvovirus B19, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, and varicella zoster virus polymerase chain reaction studies were negative and there was no evidence of hematological malignancy. Bone marrow biopsy demonstrated hypocellularity and trilineage hypoplasia with corresponding aspirate flow cytometry confirming the absence of acute leukemia. The patient was started on subcutaneous granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, provided transfusion support with packed red blood cells and platelets. Despite these measures, his blood count failed to recover, and he was discharged on eltrombopag 150 mg daily with plans for outpatient transfusion support. DPA was permanently discontinued, and he was prescribed trientine 750 mg daily. Unfortunately, his myelotoxicity remained consistent, requiring regular transfusions. He is currently undergoing evaluation for bone marrow transplant. <b>Conclusion:</b> DPA-induced myelotoxicity is a rare clinical entity. Our case demonstrates a unique clinical presentation of this phenomenon. Guidelines to mitigate the risk of and treat this toxicity remain to be determined."

At 26 years old, he was admitted because of status epilepticus. Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed frontal-dominant leukoencephalopathy with cystic changes and basal ganglia atrophy. The diagnosis of WD was confirmed based on neuropsychiatric symptoms, Kayser-Fleischer rings, abnormal copper metabolism, and a genetic analysis of ATP7B. Psychotic symptoms in WD can precede neurological manifestations, and extrapyramidal signs may be mistaken for drug-induced Parkinsonism. WD should be considered in patients presenting with progressive Parkinsonism preceded by schizophrenia-like psychiatric symptoms."

To assess barriers to transplant evaluation referral among Veterans with cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Logistic regression assessed facility, patient, clinical, and distance factors associated with transplant referral for Veterans with cirrhosis or HCC, over 1 year. VA clinicians were surveyed to understand barriers to transplant evaluation. Of 81,219 Veterans, 10% had HCC, 44% had compensated, low-MELD-Na (< 15) cirrhosis, 33% had MELD-Na > 15 or decompensated cirrhosis, and 13% had no recorded MELD-Na; 700 were referred for transplant evaluation over 1 year. Younger age, white race, being married, having fewer comorbidities, and having more severe disease or HCC were significantly associated with transplant referral. Distance to VA Transplant Center was associated with transplant referral for patients with HCC, but not for patients with cirrhosis and no HCC. Adding a random effect for facility variability reduced the importance of distance and facility complexity in models predicting referral for transplant evaluation and improved model fit. Among 196 clinician survey respondents, frequently cited transplant referral barriers included confusion about non-VA care, perceived complexity, and knowledge about processes and policies regarding alcohol, live donor transplant, and non-VA care. Multiple site, clinician, and patient variables were associated with liver transplant referral probability. Identifying addressable barriers such as education for VA clinicians is a first step toward improving transplant referral for at-risk Veterans."

    "title": "PKR downregulation prevents copper-induced synaptic dysfunction and cognitive impairment in a murine model of Wilson's disease.",
    "abstract": "Synaptic efficacy is critical for memory formation and consolidation. Accumulating evidence suggest that synapses are impaired during Wilson's disease (WD), contributing to neuronal dysfunction and cognitive decline. WD is a prototypical condition among the copper metabolism disorders. Cognitive impairment is a common feature of affected patients with neurological symptoms, presenting as memory deficits, decreased cognitive flexibility, and impaired learning capabilities. These cognitive deficits can significantly impact the quality of life, affecting work and academic performance. However, the mechanisms mediating the inhibitory synaptic dysfunction in WD are incompletely understood. We investigated the effects of the double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase/eukaryotic initiation factor 2Î± (PKR/eIF2Î±) pathway on synaptic structure and function in WD using a murine model, toxic milk (TX mice). During mouse open-field tests, we noted a substantial rise in the mobility/immobility ratio among WD model animals compared to that in WT mice. Additionally, WD mice exhibited diminished central area exploration, as evidenced by reduced travel distance. Moreover, they displayed prolonged escape latency in the Barnes maze, suggesting that chronic copper accumulation is associated with neuropsychiatric alterations and cognitive impairment. We also found a decrease in the expression of synapse-associated proteins (synapsin 1, synaptophysin, postsynaptic density protein-93 [PSD93], postsynaptic density protein-95 [PSD95]), and vesicle-associated membrane protein2 [VAMP2]) besides abnormal neurotransmitter levels (including glutamate and GABA), indicating the presence of synaptic dysfunction in TX mice. Inhibiting PKR via C16 prevented these changes, suggesting that dysfunctional cognition is associated with the PKR/eIF2Î± pathway. We also observed changes in synapses, vesicles, dendritic spine density, and dendritic length that were associated with the presence of cognitive dysfunction. Further investigation revealed that C16 treatment decreased the TUNEL-positive cell numbers in the hippocampus of TX mice and prevented 8-OHdG-induced synaptic dysfunction. Results suggest that PKR downregulation prevents copper-induced synaptic dysfunction in the murine WD model. Therefore, targeting PKR pharmacologically may be a potential therapeutic strategy for treating the copper-induced neuropathology of patients with WD."

    "abstract": "Deep learning approaches have been increasingly applied to the discovery of novel chemical compounds. These predictive approaches can accurately model compounds and increase true discovery rates, but they are typically black box in nature and do not generate specific chemical insights. Explainable deep learning aims to 'open up' the black box by providing generalizable and human-understandable reasoning for model predictions. These explanations can augment molecular discovery by identifying structural classes of compounds with desired activity in lieu of lone compounds. Additionally, these explanations can guide hypothesis generation and make searching large chemical spaces more efficient. Here we present an explainable deep learning platform that enables vast chemical spaces to be mined and the chemical substructures underlying predicted activity to be identified. The platform relies on Chemprop, a software package implementing graph neural networks as a deep learning model architecture. In contrast to similar approaches, graph neural networks have been shown to be state of the art for molecular property prediction. Focusing on discovering structural classes of antibiotics, this protocol provides guidelines for experimental data generation, model implementation and model explainability and evaluation. This protocol does not require coding proficiency or specialized hardware, and it can be executed in as little as 1-2 weeks, starting from data generation and ending in the testing of model predictions. The platform can be broadly applied to discover structural classes of other small molecules, including anticancer, antiviral and senolytic drugs, as well as to discover structural classes of inorganic molecules with desired physical and chemical properties."

It plays an important role in pharmacology and epidemiology. The method of variance estimate recovery (MOVER) is used to construct confidence intervals (CIs) for the RD. Seven types of CIs for binomial proportion are introduced to obtain MOVER-based CIs for the RD. The simulation studies show that the Agresti-Coull CI, score method incorporating continuity correction CI, Clopper Pearson CI, and Bayesian credibility CI are conservative. The Jeffreys CI, Wilson score CI, and Arcsin CI draw a satisfactory performance; they are suitable for various practical application scenarios as they can provide accurate and reliable results. To illustrate that the recommended CIs are competitive or even better than other methods, three real datasets were used."

Clinical data of the patients were collected. The two children were subjected to whole exome sequencing. Candidate variants were verified by Sanger sequencing and bioinformatic analysis. This study has been approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the Women and Children's Hospital of Ningbo University (Ethic No.EC2020-014). Child 1 was a 3-year-old male who had presented with epilepsy. Cranial MRI revealed hypoplasia of corpus callosum, down-slanting eyes, hypotonia, developmental delay, and recurrent constipation. The child was found to harbor a de novo c.262dup (p.Ile88Asnfs*31) missense variant of the ZEB2 gene, which was detected in neither parents. Child 2 was a 6-months-old male presented with epilepsy, with no apparent anomaly detected by cranial MRI. The child had featured developmental delay, inverted eyelash, atrial septal defect, and cryptorchidism. WES revealed that he had harbored a c.3213_3224delinsCTAC (p.Q1072Yfs*49) frameshifting variant of the ZEB2 gene, which was detected in neither parents. Based on the guidelines from the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics, both variants were determined as likely pathogenic, with ratings of PVS1_Strong+PM2_Supporting+PM6 and PVS1_Strong+PM2_Supporting+PM6. Both variants had resulted in premature occurrence of stop codons. By combining their clinical features and results of genetic testing, both children had been diagnosed with MWS due to variants of the ZEB2 gene. Above findings have enriched the mutational spectrum of MWS and provided a basis for the prenatal diagnosis and genetic counseling."

Incorporating the arts into clinical practice is encouraged to promote and support mental health and well-being. The aim of the PAINT project was to undertake an international mapping exercise to identify the current provision of arts programmes in kidney centres for people living with kidney disease. A multimethod approach was employed, involving a cross-sectional online survey and semi-structured qualitative interviews, which employed qualitative description research design. Healthcare staff working in kidney centres or organisations providing arts activities to individuals living with kidney disease were recruited into the study. One hundred and nineteen participants from 29 countries responded to the survey, with 39 of the respondents reporting arts activities in their renal unit. There was a wide range of respondents in terms of role, and the types of arts activities included visual arts activities, music, literature/creative writing, film, movement/dance, and craft. Individuals with chronic kidney disease who had taken part in arts activities were mostly adults (64%), and most were undergoing haemodialysis (82%). Sixteen respondents participated in the semi-structured interviews and encouraged the adoption of arts activities for people living with kidney disease. Three themes were identified: enhanced well-being and positive outcomes for individuals living with kidney disease; staff engagement and enthusiasm; and barriers to participation. This overview of arts activities being offered globally to people living with kidney disease and experiences of renal healthcare staff who provide activities in their units are encouraging in terms of arts in healthcare. These practitioners have observed the benefits of this person-centred arts approach in action, predominantly in terms of the positive impact on the well-being of individuals with kidney disease and improved relationships with staff in dialysis units. Further attention and funding should be focused on arts activities within renal centres."

We aimed to determine incidence and clinical significance of vaccine-strain transmission to unvaccinated infants in a NICU that routinely administers pentavalent rotavirus vaccine (RV5). This prospective cohort study included all patients admitted to a 100-bed NICU for 1 year. Stool specimens were collected weekly; real-time quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction was used to detect any RV5 strain. Incidence of transmission to unvaccinated infants was calculated assuming each unvaccinated patient's stool contributed 1 patient-day at risk for transmission. Investigations and geospatial analyses were conducted for suspected transmission events. Of 1238 infants admitted, 560 (45%) were premature and 322 (26%) had gastrointestinal pathology. During observation, 226 RV5 doses were administered. Overall, 3448 stool samples were tested, including 2252 from 686 unvaccinated patients. Most (681, 99.3%) unvaccinated patients never tested positive for RV5 strain. Five (<1%) tested RV5 strain positive. The estimated rate of transmission to unvaccinated infants was 5/2252 stools or 2.2/1000 patient-days at risk (95% CI: 0.7-5.2). No gastroenteritis symptoms were identified in transmission cases within 7 days of collection of RV5-positive stool. Of 126 patients for whom the RV5 series was initiated before the discharge date, 55% would have become age-ineligible to start the series if vaccination was allowed only at discharge. Transmission of RV5 strain was infrequent and without clinical consequences. Benefits of allowing vaccine-induced protection against rotavirus disease in infants through in-NICU RV5 vaccination appear to have outweighed risks from vaccine-strain transmission."

Risk factors linked with candidemia are reported in the literature. We evaluated the risk factors associated with candidemia in critically ill patients on mortality rates, including the impact of delayed or inadequate antifungal therapy (IAAT). This retrospective study evaluated non-neutropenic critically ill adult patients with candidemia for six consecutive years. Antifungal therapy was evaluated for the following: the correct dose based on the <i>in vitro</i> activity against <i>Candida</i> species identified on culture, the time interval from culture positivity to the initiation of antifungal therapy, and the duration of antifungal therapy. Adequate antifungal therapy (AAT) was defined as the initial antifungal agent administered to the patient with <i>in vitro</i> activity against <i>Candida</i> species identified on culture using the correct dose, time of initiation, and duration of therapy. IAAT was determined if the antifungal did not have <i>in vitro</i> activity against the <i>Candida</i> species identified on culture with the initial incorrect dose. In the 91 critically ill patients evaluated with documented candidemia, the mean age was 57Â±16 years, the mean Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score was 25Â±9, and the overall mortality rate was 38%. Patients with the following risk factors for candidemia had an increased mortality: use of mechanical ventilation (35 (100%), p<0.001), vasopressor therapy (28 (80%), p<0.001), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) (11 (31%), p<0.001), and â¥ 2 organ failure (23 (65%), p=0.002).

An explorative qualitative design was used; participants with confirmed UFs diagnoses or surgery related to UFs were purposively recruited for focus group discussions. Data collection was guided by the revised Wilson and Cleary model of health-related quality of life (HRQOL), which was iteratively analysed using Braun and Clark's thematic analysis framework. Sixty participants with confirmed UFs diagnoses or surgery related to UFs were included in this study. Five themes emerged: awareness of the disease, symptoms experienced, treatment and care, perceptions and beliefs and health-seeking behaviour. Most participants experienced physical symptoms, abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding. Among the emotional and psychological consequences experienced by the majority of participants were fear, worry, tension and (perceived) disrupted body image. The majority of the participants lacked knowledge of UFs, and their perceptions and health-seeking behaviour differed. Findings showed that most participants experienced physical, psychological, emotional and social challenges. These experiences were influenced by lack of knowledge, symptoms experienced, poor treatment and care and perceptions and beliefs about UFs.

Median FC declined significantly from 650 mcg/g at baseline to 190 mcg/g at Week 8 in Group 1 (p < 0.001). At 16 weeks, 23/28 patients (82%) continued in clinical remission. Nausea and vomiting were reported in 4/44 patients. Our real-world data demonstrate that CD AZCRO represents an alternative induction therapy for mild to moderate paediatric CD."

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic presented significant challenges to researchers collecting data with older adults, particularly older adults with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). The goal of this article is to articulate the communicative and methodological challenges and lessons learned from collecting data with older adults in senior living communities with mild cognitive impairment and ADRD and their adult children (who were geographically separated) during the pandemic. Communication was much more than what we were studying; it was essential to the success and ethical implementation of our research. We were working with a vulnerable population during a pandemic where recruitment, consent, and data collection required heightened and adapted communication strategies to reduce confusion, promote safety, and ensure data could be collected in an effective manner. The way we communicated with the participants, their networks, and the senior living communities was crucial to establishing strong human connections and subsequently successful data collection."

    "title": "Waning success: a 2013-2022 spatial and temporal trend analysis of malaria in Ethiopia.",
    "abstract": "Despite consecutive decades of success in reducing malaria transmission, Ethiopia went off track towards its goal of malaria elimination by 2030, as outlined in the NMCP malaria strategy. Recent malaria outbreaks in Ethiopia are attributed to the emergence and spread of diagnostic and drug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum, increased insecticide resistance in major vectors and the spread of invasive Anopheles stephensi. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, environmental anomalies and internal conflicts have also potentially played a role in increasing malaria transmission. This study aimed to evaluate the contribution of environmental factors and An. stephensi to the spatiotemporal trends of recent malaria cases in Ethiopia. Clinical malaria case data reported weekly between January 2013 and January 2023 were obtained from the Ethiopian Public Health Institute (EPHI), Addis Ababa. A negative binomial regression model was used to explain the variability and potential overdispersion in the weekly number of malaria cases reported across Ethiopian administrative zones. This model incorporated fixed effects for selected environmental factors and random effects to capture temporal trends, zone specific seasonal patterns, spatial trends at the zone level, and the presence of An. stephensi and its impact. Our negative binomial regression model highlighted 56% variability in the data and slightly more than half (55%) was due to environmental factors, while the remainder was captured by random effects. A significant nationwide decline in malaria risk was observed between 2013 and 2018, followed by a sharp increase in early 2022. Malaria risk was higher in western and northwestern zones of Ethiopia compared to other zones. Zone-specific seasonal patterns, not explained by environmental factors, were grouped into four clusters of seasonal behaviours. The presence of An. stephensi was not shown to have any significant impact on malaria risk. Understanding the spatial and temporal drivers of malaria transmission and therefore identifying more appropriate malaria control strategies are key to the success of any malaria elimination and eradication programmes in Ethiopia. Our study found that approximately 50% of malaria risk variability could be explained by environmental, temporal, and spatial factors included in the analysis, while the remaining variation was unexplained and may stem from other factors not considered in this study. This highlights the need for a better understanding of underlying factors driving local malaria transmission and outbreaks, to better tailor regional programmatic responses."

A cost-consequence analysis of the VRGS model of care compared with usual care (treatment by local or locum [non-VRGS] doctors) from the perspective of the health care funder in 2022 prices. Twenty-nine rural and remote hospitals in the Western NSW Local Health District where the VRGS has been in operation (VRGS sites). Patients of any age who presented to an emergency department (ED) or were admitted to hospital at VRGS sites over the pre-VRGS period (1 February 2019 to 31 January 2020) or the post-VRGS period (1 July 2021 to 30 June 2022). The VRGS model of care, which provides 24-hour 7-days-a-week rural generalist doctors, both virtually and in person, to small rural and remote hospitals, predominantly for lower acuity ED presentations, daily ward rounds for inpatients admitted by a VRGS medical officer, and ad hoc inpatient medical reviews when local doctors need support or are unavailable. Incremental cost per incremental quality-of-care outcome, maintenance of health service activity levels, workforce sustainability (measured by changes in locum shifts), and service acceptability (as determined by thematic analysis of interviews). The cost per standard unit of health care (national weighted activity unit) was lower for the VRGS ($1047) than for usual care ($1753). VRGS doctors dealt with ED presentations of similar complexity to non-VRGS doctors, and admissions of significantly lower (40%) complexity. Health service activity remained stable from the pre-VRGS period to the post-VRGS period, only declining by 4% in the post-VRGS period, which was during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Locum shifts decreased from 1456 days in the pre-VRGS period to 609 days in the post-VRGS period, improving the sustainability of the workforce. Local doctors and managers found the VRGS to be acceptable, but thought it could be enhanced with additional investment in nursing and technical staff. Our economic evaluation of the VRGS showed that it provided lower cost care and equivalent quality-of-care outcomes when compared with usual care for ED presentations of the same complexity, and supported local clinical staff to maintain activity levels despite a pandemic. With additional investment in data capture and in nursing and technical staff to support the service, the VRGS has promise as a flexible service that can help sustain access to quality medical care in rural and remote communities."

    "abstract": "Even as many outcomes for people living with cystic fibrosis (PLwCF) improve, individuals still experience extensive symptom burdens. From birth, many PLwCF experience both pain as a symptom of their CF disease and procedural pain, posing detriments to health, functioning, and quality of life. Despite its prevalence and impact, there is no CF-specific guidance for the assessment and management of pain. Similarly, no guidance exists regarding communication with PLwCF about their pain experiences or its impact on their lives. Therefore, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF) assembled an expert panel of clinicians, researchers, PLwCF, and caregivers to develop consensus recommendations for pain management in CF. We utilized literature review and expert opinion to develop 13 recommendations addressing pain assessment, management, and communication. Recommendations are centered on guiding principles of utilizing a multimodal approach to pain management, offering age and developmentally appropriate assessment and interventions, concurrently treating underlying conditions causing, contributing to, and/or exacerbated by pain, considering societal stigma of the pain experience, particularly for minoritized and marginalized people, and sensitivity to issues of access and cost. These recommendations are intended to guide clinicians in managing pain and improving quality of life for PLwCF with pain at all stages of illness and development."

    "abstract": "Iron homoeostasis is tightly regulated, with hepcidin and soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) playing significant roles. However, the genetic determinants of these traits and the biomedical consequences of iron homoeostasis variation are unclear. In a meta-analysis of 12 cohorts involving 91,675 participants, we found 43 genomic loci associated with either hepcidin or sTfR concentration, of which 15 previously unreported. Mapping to putative genes indicated involvement in iron-trait expression, erythropoiesis, immune response and cellular trafficking. Mendelian randomisation of 292 disease outcomes in 1,492,717 participants revealed associations of iron-related loci and iron status with selected health outcomes across multiple domains. These associations were largely driven by HFE, which was associated with the largest iron variation. Our findings enhance understanding of iron homoeostasis and its biomedical consequences, suggesting that lifelong exposure to higher iron levels is likely associated with lower risk of anaemia-related disorders and higher risk of genitourinary, musculoskeletal, infectious and neoplastic diseases."

    "abstract": "Bleeding is common in patients with haematological malignancies undergoing intensive therapy. We aimed to assess the effect of tranexamic acid on preventing bleeding and the need for platelet transfusions. TREATT was an international, randomised, double-blind, parallel, phase 3 superiority trial conducted at 27 haematology centres in Australia and the UK. We enrolled adults (aged â¥18 years) receiving intensive chemotherapy or haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation for a haematological malignancy, with a platelet count of 10 Ã 10<sup>9</sup> platelets per L or less for 5 days or longer. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) using block randomisation, stratified by site, to tranexamic acid (1 g every 8 h intravenously or 1Â·5g every 8 h orally) or placebo when their platelet count was less than 30 Ã 10<sup>9</sup> platelets per L. Treatment was continued until platelet recovery or day 30. Prophylactic platelet transfusions were maintained as standard of care. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who died or had WHO grade 2 or higher bleeding up to day 30. A modified intention-to-treat population including randomly assigned patients whose platelet count decreased to 30 Ã 10<sup>9</sup> platelets per L or less was used for analysis. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03136445), ISRCTN (ISRCTN73545489), and the European Clinical Trials Register (EudraCT 2014-001513-35). Between June 23, 2015, and Feb 17, 2022, 1736 patients were screened for eligibility, 616 of whom were enrolled and randomly assigned (310 to tranexamic acid and 306 to placebo). 19 participants were excluded from the modified intention-to-treat analysis, leaving 300 participants in the tranexamic acid group and 297 in the placebo group. Participant median age was 58 years (IQR 49-65), 380 (62%) of 616 participants were male, and 235 (38%) were female. The proportion of participants who died or had WHO grade 2 or higher bleeding was 31Â·7% (90/298 [95% CI 26Â·6-37Â·4]) in the tranexamic acid group and 34Â·2% (98/295 [29Â·0-40Â·0]) in the placebo group (hazard ratio 0Â·92 [95% CI 0Â·67-1Â·27]; p=0Â·62). There were no differences in thrombotic events or veno-occlusive disease. 94 serious adverse events in 77 participants were reported up to day 60 in the tranexamic acid group and 103 events in 82 participants in the placebo group. There is insufficient evidence to support routine use of tranexamic acid to reduce bleeding in patients with haematological malignancies undergoing intensive chemotherapy.

    "title": "Noninvasive Ventilation in Acute Asthma Exacerbations: A Systematic Review.",
    "abstract": "<b>Rationale:</b> Because of a paucity of evidence, multiple clinical practice guidelines lack recommendations pertaining to noninvasive ventilation (NIV) in acute asthma exacerbations. However, the evidence syntheses for these guidelines were performed years ago, and more recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies have been published. <b>Objectives:</b> We sought to update the evidence syntheses from previous guidelines to further clarify the effects of NIV in acute asthma exacerbations. <b>Methods:</b> A systematic search of Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Library was conducted, studies comparing NIV plus standard medical therapy with standard medical therapy alone in adults with acute asthma exacerbations were selected using <i>a priori</i> selection criteria, and relevant data were extracted. Weighted aggregation (meta-analysis) was performed to summarize effects, which were appraised using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (or, GRADE) approach. <b>Results:</b> Eight RCTs and five observational studies were selected. NIV was associated with a reduced intubation rate (RCTs: risk ratio [RR] = 0.46; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.16 to 1.29; observational studies: RR = 0.55; 95% CI = 0.45 to 0.68), admission rate (RR = 0.57; 95% CI = 0.34 to 0.98), and time to improvement in accessory muscle use (mean difference = -1.13 h; 95% CI = -1.28 to -0.99). Additional outcomes favored NIV plus standard medical therapy but did not reach statistical significance, including dyspnea measures and spirometry measures. There were too few deaths to assess mortality reliably. The quality of evidence ranged from low to very low for all outcomes. <b>Conclusions:</b> All statistically significant outcomes favored NIV plus standard medical therapy over standard medical therapy alone in adults with acute asthma exacerbations. Our aggregate data suggest that intubation rate may be reduced with NIV plus standard medical therapy, although the overall quality of the evidence is low. If this is a true effect, it may be clinically important, because intubation has been shown to correlate with mortality in multiple observational trials. Given these findings, patients with acute asthma exacerbations may benefit from a trial of NIV in addition to standard medical therapy."

    "abstract": "Evidence suggests that long-term exposure to air pollution may increase the risk of dementia and related cognitive outcomes. A major source of air pollution is automotive traffic, which is modifiable by technological and regulatory interventions. We examined associations of four traffic-related air pollutants with rates of cognitive decline in a cohort of older adults. We analyzed data from the Chicago Health and Aging Project (CHAP), a longitudinal (1993-2012) community-based cohort study of older adults that included repeated assessments of participants' cognitive performance. Leveraging previously developed air pollution models, we predicted participant-level exposures to the tailpipe pollutants oxides of nitrogen (<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mrow><mrow><msub><mrow><mi>NO</mi></mrow><mrow><mi>X</mi></mrow></msub></mrow></mrow></math>) and nitrogen dioxide (<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mrow><mrow><msub><mrow><mi>NO</mi></mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></msub></mrow></mrow></math>), plus the nontailpipe pollutants copper and zinc found in coarse particulate matter [PM with aerodynamic diameter <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mrow><mn>2.5</mn><mspace></mspace><mi>Î¼</mi><mi>m</mi></mrow></math> to <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mrow><mn>10</mn><mspace></mspace><mi>Î¼</mi><mi>m</mi></mrow></math> (<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mrow><mrow><msub><mrow><mrow><mi>PM</mi></mrow></mrow><mrow><mrow><mn>2.5</mn><mo>-</mo><mn>10</mn></mrow><mo>,</mo><mi>Cu</mi></mrow></msub></mrow></mrow></math>) and <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mrow><mrow><msub><mrow><mrow><mi>PM</mi></mrow></mrow><mrow><mrow><mn>2.5</mn><mo>-</mo><mn>10</mn></mrow><mo>,</mo><mi>Zn</mi></mrow></msub></mrow></mrow></math>, respectively], over the 3 y prior to each participant's baseline assessment. Using generalized estimating equations, we estimated covariate-adjusted associations of each pollutant with rates of cognitive decline. We probed the robustness of our results via several sensitivity analyses, including alterations to the length of the exposure assessment window and exploring the influence of pre- and post-baseline selection bias. Using data from 6,061 participants, estimated associations of these pollutant exposures with cognitive decline were largely inconsistent with large adverse effects. For example, a standard deviation (<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mrow><mn>5.8</mn><mtext> ppb</mtext></mrow></math>) increment in <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mrow><mrow><msub><mrow><mi>NO</mi></mrow><mrow><mi>X</mi></mrow></msub></mrow></mrow></math> corresponded to a slightly slower rate of cognitive decline [e.g., mean difference in change in global score, 0.010 standard unit/5 y, 95% confidence interval (CI): <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mrow><mi>-0</mi><mi>.016</mi></mrow></math>, 0.036]. The results of most of our sensitivity analyses were in generally similar to those of our main analyses, but our prebaseline selection bias results suggest that our analytic results may have been influenced by differential survivorship into our study sample.

To describe trends in public and private insurance coverage and dialysis spending among patients with incident ESKD from 2012 to 2017. This serial cross-sectional study included patients 18 to 64 years old in Colorado who were not enrolled in Medicare at dialysis initiation. Data analysis was conducted from May to August 2023. Introduction of the ACA Marketplace in 2014. Medicare, Medicaid, or private insurance enrollment in the first year after dialysis initiation, and dialysis spending by insurance type. Of 2005 patients included in the sample, 1416 (70.6%) were 45 to 64 years old, and 1259 (62.8%) were male. A lower proportion of patients with incident ESKD starting dialysis were newly enrolled in Medicare in the years following the ACA (361 of 713 [50.6%]) compared to 2 years prior (420 of 595 [70.6%]). Unadjusted rates of switching from Medicaid to Medicare 1 year after dialysis initiation decreased 14.3 percentage points over time (68.9% in 2012-2013 vs 58.3% and 54.6% in 2014-2015 and 2016-2017, respectively). Unadjusted rates of switching from private insurance to Medicare 1 year after dialysis initiation decreased by 22.3 percentage points (68.1% in 2012-2013 vs 52.2% and 45.8% in 2014-2015 and 2016-2017, respectively). Over the entire 2012 to 2017 period, quarterly dialysis spending in the first year of dialysis among patients with private insurance was higher than among those with Medicare coverage ($26 351-$29 781 vs $10 039-$12 741). This cross-sectional study demonstrates that lower Medicare enrollment rates over time among those initiating dialysis may be inducing higher social spending. This finding raises concerns about the effectiveness of Medicare policies and federal leverage to improve access, outcomes, and value of dialysis care."

This was a prospective cohort study of US veterans enrolled in the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Million Veteran Program (MVP) between 2011 and 2022. Data were analyzed from 2023 to 2024. LE8 score ranged from 0 to 100, with higher score indicating better cardiovascular health. The primary outcome was total ASCVD incidence in veterans without baseline ASCVD, and the secondary outcome was incidence of a major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) among veterans with and without ASCVD at baseline. A total of 413 052 veterans (mean [SD] age, 65.8 [12.1] years; 378 162 [91.6%] male) were included. Based on 1.7 million person-years of follow-up of 279 868 veterans without any ASCVD at baseline, 45 067 veterans had an ASCVD event during follow-up. Total LE8 score and each component LE8 factor score was associated with incident ASCVD in an inverse, linear, dose-response manner. For veterans without prior ASCVD, those with an LE8 score between 80 and 100 had lower risk of ASCVD compared with those with an LE8 score of 0 to 49 (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 0.36 [95% CI, 0.35-0.38]). Similarly, risk of MACE was significantly lower among veterans with an LE8 score of 80 to 100 regardless of baseline ASCVD status (with ASCVD: aHR, 0.52 [95% CI, 0.48-0.56]; without ASCVD: aHR, 0.14 [95% CI, 0.13-0.15]) compared with those with ASCVD and an LE8 score of 0 to 49. In this cohort study of US veterans, higher LE8 scores were associated with significantly lower ASCVD incidence risk and lower likelihood of developing adverse cardiovascular events regardless of ASCVD status at baseline. These results support the utility of LE8 for health promotion and ASCVD prevention."

We aimed to assess whether adding female-specific risk factors to traditional factors could improve CVD risk prediction. We used a cohort of women from the UK Biobank Study aged 45 to 69 years, free of CVD at baseline (2006-2010) followed until the end of 2019. We developed Cox proportional hazards models using the risk factors included in 3 contemporary CVD risk calculators: Pooled Cohort Equation - Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease, Qrisk2, and PREDICT. We added each of the following female-specific risk factors, individually and all together, to determine if these improved measures of discrimination and calibration for predicting CVD: early menarche (<11 years), endometriosis, excessive, frequent or irregular menstruation, miscarriage, number of miscarriages, number of stillbirths, infertility, preeclampsia or eclampsia, gestational diabetes (without subsequent type 2 diabetes), premature menopause (<40 years), early menopause (<45 years), and natural or surgical early menopause (menopause <45 years or timing of menopause reported as unknown and oophorectomy reported at age <45). In the model of 135 142 women (mean age, 57.5 years; SD, 6.8) using risk factors from Pooled Cohort Equation - Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease, CVD incidence was 5.3 per 1000 person-years. The c-indices for the Pooled Cohort Equation - Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease, Qrisk2, and PREDICT models were 0.710, 0.713, and 0.718, respectively. Adding each of the female-specific risk factors did not improve the c-index, the net reclassification index, the integrated discrimination index, the slope of the regression line for predicted versus observed events, and the Brier score or plots of calibration. Adding all female-specific risk factors simultaneously increased the c-index for the Pooled Cohort Equation - Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease, Qrisk2, and PREDICT models to 0.712, 0.715, and 0.720, respectively. Although several female-specific factors have been shown to be early indicators of CVD risk, these factors should not be used to reclassify risk in women aged 45 to 69 years when considering whether to commence a blood pressure or lipid-lowering medication."

This method is useful for providing insights into the biological relevance of genetic association signals, particularly in intergenic regions, which can help to elucidate disease mechanisms in OA and other complex traits. To review the existing literature on genetic colocalization methods, assess their suitability for studying OA, and investigate their capacity to integrate miRNA data, while bearing in view their statistical assumptions. We followed scoping review methodology and used Covidence software for data management. Search terms for colocalization, GWAS, and genetic or statistical models were used in the databases MEDLINE and EMBASE, searched till March 4, 2024. Our search returned 546 peer-reviewed papers, of which 96 were included following title/abstract and full-text screening. Based on both cumulative and annual publication counts, the most cited method for colocalization analysis was coloc. Four papers examined OA-related phenotypes, and none examined miRNA. An approach to colocalization analysis using miRNA was postulated based on further hand-searching. Colocalization analysis is a largely unexplored method in OA. Many of the approaches to colocalization analysis identified in this review, including the integration of GWAS and miRNA data, may help to elucidate genetic and epigenetic factors implicated in OA and other complex traits."

    "abstract": "Unsheltered individuals have limited access to restroom facilities. With this, many unsheltered individuals are forced to urinate, defecate, and engage in other hygiene practices outdoors. They may also lack access to necessary hygiene toiletries or wait to urinate or defecate until they are able to gain access to a facility. These challenges can lead to health issues, like urinary tract infections (UTIs), diarrhea, rashes, etc. The study objective was to understand the relationship between lack of access to basic hygiene facilities and health effects among unsheltered individuals. A verbal survey (English and Spanish) was used to explore the relationship between hygiene and unsheltered status. In Fall 2022, a researcher accompanied the homeless outreach team from El Rio Health, a Federally Qualified Health Center in Tucson, Arizona to verbally consent and recruit participants. Thirty consenting unsheltered adults ranging in ages from 29 to 68 years old participated in the study. Access to water was the greatest reported hygiene barrier, followed by access to soap, concerns for privacy, and concerns for safety. Eleven of thirty participants experienced a UTI at least once since becoming unsheltered and nine of thirty experienced a yeast infection at least once, with female participants having a statistically significant (<i>p</i> < 0.05) higher rate of occurrence than male participants. In addition, 19/30 of participants experienced a rash at least once and 17/30 of participants experienced diarrhea at least once. However, 20/30 of participants did not seek medical care for their health-related issues. Low healthcare utilization when there is a high need for care highlights the importance of community outreach and care for those experiencing homelessness.

Forty-one caregivers completed follow-up telephone interviews. About 70% of caregivers reported their care recipient wore the wearable device daily, and 39.1% used the smartphone application daily. Approximately 31% of caregivers reported daily use of the tracking feature, 30.8% reported daily use of the \"safe zone\" feature (i.e., geo-fencing), and 17.1% reported daily use of the two-way calling feature. About 39% of caregivers were extremely satisfied with the \"system,\" 43.6% found it extremely easy to use, and 46.2% found it extremely useful for caregiving. On average, caregivers with higher baseline Zarit Burden Interview scores found the \"system\" to be more useful with their caregiving (f = 5.97, p = 0.006) and were more satisfied with the \"system\" (f = 3.75, p = 0.034). Findings suggest caregiver burden may drive the perceived usefulness of, and satisfaction with, technology-based solutions."

    "title": "Loss of the mitochondrial protein mitoNEET in mice is associated with cognitive impairments and increased neuroinflammation.",
    "abstract": "Mitochondrial dysfunction is implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases associated with memory and cognitive deficits, including Alzheimer's disease. Changes in bioenergetic function results in reactive oxygen species, oxidative damage and consequently neuroinflammation, which contributes to neuronal cell loss. In this study, we evaluated the impact of the loss of the redox active [2Fe-2S] mitochondrial-associated protein mitoNEET (CISD1) on neuroinflammation and cognition using an age-appropriate preclinical model. While associations between neuroinflammation and poor cognitive impacts have been shown in recent work, little has been done to assess whether loss of mitoNEET is associated with changes in neuroinflammatory markers or negative cognitive-behavioral outcomes. Using 9-11-month-old mitoNEET knockout (CISD1-/-) and wild-type mice, we conducted a battery of cognitive tests to assess the impact of mitoNEET loss on performance. We then histologically evaluated the effect of absence of mitoNEET on markers of neuroinflammation in the aged brain. We found loss of mitoNEET in mice was associated with a significant reduction in willingness to explore within an open field and impaired short-term spatial working memory in the Y-maze. We also found a significant reduction in novel object recognition memory that was gene-dependent and accompanied by reduced c-fos expression in hippocampus and cortical regions. Our findings indicate that mitoNEET loss is significantly associated with impairments in cognitive-behavioral and neuroinflammatory outcomes; specifically, learning and memory, anxiety-like behaviors, neuroinflammation, and neural activation. This is the first study to demonstrate cognitive-associated behavioral deficits with neuroinflammation in the mitoNEET knockout mouse model."

    "abstract": "Studies have shown that Emergency Department physicians have little to no training in recognizing and supporting victims of human trafficking despite being uniquely situated to identify and intervene on behalf of these patients. We assessed if screening for human trafficking was being completed by emergency physicians in three Saskatoon emergency departments. We performed a retrospective chart review of patients presenting to three Saskatoon emergency departments deemed to potentially be at risk of human trafficking, based on discharge diagnosis. Of the 223 included charts, data extracted included sex, age, ethnicity, chief complaint, diagnosis, disposition, HT Screening (Y/N), specific quotes relating to HT, time of visit, intimate partner violence (Y/N), and travel history. Both quantitative and qualitative thematic analyses were conducted on this data. None of the charts (0%) included in this study had any documentation around screening for human trafficking. Furthermore, 21.1% of the high-risk patient charts included in this study -- which included many patients with a discharge diagnosis of sexually transmitted disease or pelvic inflammatory disease -- did not contain a documented sexual history. Thematic analysis revealed that the patients included in this study frequently had challenges with sexual health, substance use, and houselessness. This study found that Emergency physicians in Saskatoon were not routinely screening for human trafficking. Implementation of further training is needed to help these physicians recognize and subsequently support potential victims of human trafficking."

    "abstract": "Here we present long-term outcomes of first line afatinib in comorbid patients with suspected or confirmed EGFR mutant NSCLC otherwise considered unsuitable for chemotherapy, and the clinical utility of serial ctDNA monitoring. TIMELY (NCT01415011) was a multicentre, single arm, phase II trial conducted in the UK. Patients aged â¥18 were treated with daily oral afatinib (40 mg) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Blood samples for ctDNA analysis were obtained at baseline and 12-weekly until treatment discontinuation. The primary endpoint was PFS. Thirty-nine patients were enrolled between March 2013 and August 2015. Median follow-up was 98 months (range 69-101). Median PFS was 7.9 months (95% CI 4.6-10.5). Seven patients (18%) continued afatinib beyond 18 months, 3 beyond 36 months and 2 were still on treatment at last follow-up 101 months post-treatment initiation. Analysis of baseline ctDNA samples identified 8 EGFR mutant cases that were not identified by tissue genotyping and ctDNA clearance was associated with improved PFS and OS. Afatinib is a viable treatment option for tissue or ctDNA-detected EGFR mutant NSCLC comorbid patients, with a proportion achieving long-term clinical benefit. Plasma ctDNA testing improved EGFR mutant identification and its clearance predicted improved PFS and OS."

    "title": "Differential antigenic imprinting effects between influenza H1N1 hemagglutinin and neuraminidase in a mouse model.",
    "abstract": "Understanding how immune history influences influenza immunity is essential for developing effective vaccines and therapeutic strategies. This study examines the antigenic imprinting of influenza hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) using a mouse model with sequential infections by H1N1 virus strains exhibiting substantial antigenic differences in HA. In our pre-2009 influenza infection model, we observed that mice with more extensive infection histories produced higher levels of functional NA-inhibiting antibodies (NAI). However, following further infection with the 2009 pandemic H1N1 strain, these mice demonstrated a reduced NAI to the challenged virus. Interestingly, prior exposure to older strains resulted in a lower HA antibody response (neutralization and HAI) to the challenged virus in both pre- and post-2009 scenarios, potentially due to faster viral clearance facilitated by immune memory recall. Overall, our findings reveal distinct trajectories in HA and NA immune responses, suggesting that immune imprinting can differentially impact these proteins based on the extent of antigenic variation in influenza viruses. Influenza viruses continue to pose a significant threat to human health, with vaccine effectiveness remaining a persistent challenge. Individual immune history is a crucial factor that can influence antibody responses to subsequent influenza exposures. While many studies have explored how pre-existing antibodies shape the induction of anti-HA antibodies following influenza virus infections or vaccinations, the impact on anti-NA antibodies has been less extensively studied. Using a mouse model, our study demonstrates that within pre-2009 H1N1 strains, an extensive immune history negatively impacted anti-HA antibody responses but enhanced anti-NA antibody responses. However, in response to the 2009 pandemic H1N1 strain, which experienced an antigenic shift, both anti-HA and anti-NA antibody responses were hindered by antibodies from prior pre-2009 H1N1 virus infections. These findings provide important insights into how antigenic imprinting affects both anti-HA and anti-NA antibody responses and underscore the need to consider immune history in developing more effective influenza vaccination strategies."

    "abstract": "Between February and April 2018, <i>Salmonella typhimurium</i> within a unique 5-single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) address was isolated from 28 cases with links to a small rural area of Northeast England, with five cases prospectively identified by whole genome sequencing (WGS). Infections had a severe clinical picture with ten cases hospitalized (36%), two cases with invasive disease, and two deaths reported. Interviews determined that 24 cases (86%) had been exposed to a local independent butcher's shop (Butcher A).A case-control study using controls recruited by systematic digit dialling established that cases were 68 times more likely to have consumed cooked meat from Butcher A (Adjusted OR 68.1; 95% CI: 1.9-2387.6; <i>P</i> = 0.02). <i>Salmonella typhimurium</i> genetically highly related to 28 of the outbreak cases was also isolated from a sample of cooked meat on sale in the premises.Epidemiological and microbiological investigations suggest this outbreak was likely associated with the consumption of ready-to-eat foods supplied by the implicated butcher. A relatively large number of cases were involved despite the rurality of the food business, with cases resident across the Northeast and Yorkshire identified using WGS, demonstrating the benefit of timely sequencing information to community outbreak investigations."

    "abstract": "This study aims to analyze the lipid metabolism patterns and identify risk factors for dyslipidemia in Wilson's Disease (WD), offering novel insights into diagnosis and treatment strategies for unexplained dyslipidemia. Data from Wilson's disease patients hospitalized at the First People's Hospital of Shanghai from December 2008 to February 2015 were collected. Patients were categorized into normal lipid (46 cases) and dyslipidemia (42 cases) groups based on lipid levels. Group analyzes were conducted using t-tests, chi-square analysis, and rank sum tests. Spearman correlation, multiple linear regression, or Logistic regression were employed to identify relevant influencing factors. 1. The incidence of abnormal blood lipids in a series of Wilson's disease patients was 47.73% (25.12 Â± 1.29 years old), and the incidence of control healthy group was 27.40%, with proportions of hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol being 14.77, 30.68, and 29.63%, respectively; 2. Significant differences were observed between the dyslipidemia and normal WD groups in AST/ALT ratio, liver parenchymal echo, liver surface, spleen area, and ultrasound total score.3. Low-and high-density lipoprotein cholesterols (LDL-c and HDL-c) showed no significant correlation with these indicators. Triglyceride (TG) exhibited moderately negative correlation with AST/ALT, liver parenchymal echo, spleen area, and ultrasound score. Total cholesterol (TC) displayed low negative correlation with these factors. 1. Dyslipidemia incidence in Wilson's disease patients may exceed that of the normal population, especially in adolescents with unexplained abnormal lipid metabolism; 2. Patients with mild to moderate liver damage are predisposed to elevated triglycerides and total cholesterol, reflecting liver damage impact on lipid metabolism; 3. Glucose metabolism is not implicated in WD-related dyslipidemia; 4. No significant correlation was found between abnormal lipid metabolism and blood concentration of trace elements in WD patients."

    "abstract": "Testicular microlithiasis (TM) is characterised by microcalcifications in the testes and has been associated with infertility. This has led to studies of semen analysis in men with the condition. This systematic review aimed to compare semen parameters in men with TM and those without. Men with classic TM (â¥ 5 microcalcifications per sonographic image) were also compared to those with limited TM (< 5 microcalcifications per sonographic image). Additionally, testicular volume and hormone levels were analysed as secondary outcomes. This review was carried out according to PRISMA guidelines and registered on PROSPERO. The quality of included studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Embase, MEDLINE, World of Science and Scopus were searched. Abstracts were screened against inclusion/exclusion criteria by two independent reviewers. Eligible studies included data on semen parameters in men with TM where semen analysis was done according to World Health Organisation recommendations. Studies with populations consisting of men with testicular cancer were excluded. After searching the databases, 137 papers were found and 10 studies involving 611 men with TM were included in the analysis. In the studies that compared sperm concentration in men with TM to controls, six (100%) found lower sperm concentration in the TM group. Six studies compared sperm motility, of which 4 (66.7%) showed lower motility in the TM group compared to controls. Five studies compared sperm morphology, with three (60%) finding a lower percentage of normal morphology in the TM group compared to controls. Six studies compared classic TM with limited TM. All six (100%) found a lower sperm concentration in the classic TM group compared to the limited TM group. Results also suggested that more extensive disease is associated with poorer sperm concentration. This review suggests that TM is associated with decreased semen parameters, particularly sperm concentration. However, clinical outcomes should be investigated by studying pregnancy rates in males with TM. Future research that controls for confounding variables, involves larger sample sizes, and utilises advanced sperm function tests is also advised. Further research is important for establishing clinical guidance and suggestions for fertility follow-up in men with TM."

    "abstract": "To identify factors associated with cholesteatoma in a large UK cohort. Although some risk factors are frequently reported (male sex, history of chronic otitis media), other associations require further evidence (deprivation, smoking). Briefly, 1140 cholesteatoma cases from UK BioBank were compared to 4551 non-cholesteatoma middle ear disease and 493 832 ear disease-free controls. Adjusted odds ratios were calculated for demographic factors including age, sex, ethnicity, deprivation and smoking status with logistic regressions. Odds ratios for overlapping ICD-10 codes are also calculated. Cholesteatoma was significantly associated with sex (Adjusted odds ratio (AOR) for males = 1.33, 95%CI = [1.179-1.491]), age (AOR = 1.02, 95%CI = [1.011-1.026]) and deprivation (AOR = 1.08, 95%CI = [1.059-1.097]) compared to ear disease-free controls (p < 0.001). Age and deprivation distributions for cholesteatoma and non-cholesteatoma ear disease were similar. Although there was no significant association with smoking status, cholesteatoma was significantly associated with the ICD-10 code mental and behavioural disorders due to tobacco use (OR = 2.34, p < 0.001, 95%CI = [1.942, 2.813]). Cholesteatoma was also strongly associated with a wide range of inflammatory middle ear conditions and chronic sinus inflammation, suggesting an increased susceptibility to inflammation of the upper airways. This study shows a large overlap between cholesteatoma and non-cholesteatoma ear disease in terms of numbers and demographics, with sex being a key factor distinguishing between the two, suggesting that there are both common and distinct associated factors."

    "title": "Early Onset of Wilson's Disease and Possible Role of Disease-Modifying Genes: A Case Report and Literature Review.",
    "abstract": "Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene, resulting in copper accumulation. Symptoms rarely appear before the age of 5, almost never before 3. The phenotypic variability of WD suggests the presence of modifying factors, making early diagnosis challenging. We present a case of symptomatic WD in a toddler, emphasizing the importance of considering WD in differential diagnoses and exploring genetic modifiers influencing disease onset. Clinical and laboratory assessments, including liver biopsy, were performed on a 4.2-year-old boy presenting with hypertransaminasemia and mild hepatomegaly. Histological evaluation revealed chronic hepatitis with fibrosis and severe steatosis, indicating long-standing active disease. Genetic analysis identified a missense variant and a 15-nucleotide deletion in the 5' UTR promoter region of the ATP7B gene, confirming the WD diagnosis. Additionally, homozygosity for the HFE H63D variant was detected, with transferrin saturations at the upper limit of normal. The patient's clinical management included a trial of D-penicillamine, discontinued due to side effects, followed by successful zinc acetate therapy. This case underscores the consideration of WD in the differential diagnosis of toddlers. The Ferenci-Leipzig score remains a valid diagnostic tool for WD even in the presence of a single ATP7B variant, although extended genetic analysis should still be considered. Normal ceruloplasmin levels do not rule out WD. Environmental, epigenetic, and genetic factors appear to influence the WD phenotype; HFE variants may act as modifiers given the link between iron and copper homeostasis, possibly explaining the early symptomatic onset in our patient."

    "abstract": "Ethiopia faces several severe challenges in terms of malaria elimination, including drug resistance and diagnostic evasion in the Plasmodium falciparum parasite, insecticide resistance in the primary Anopheles malaria vector, and, most recently, the invasion of the Asian malaria vector Anopheles stephensi. Novel malaria control methods are therefore needed, and in this paper, we describe the evaluation of a larval source management (LSM) strategy implemented in response to An. stephensi. The primary outcome was the malaria incidence rate compared between intervention and non-intervention sites in the presence of An. stephensi. Intervention (Batu and Dire Dawa) and control (Metehara) towns were selected, and weekly malaria passive case detection data collected between 2014 and 2023 were obtained from the Oromia regional state and Dire Dawa City Administration Health Bureau. In addition, data regarding intervention were obtained from the President's Malaria Initiative (PMI) reports. Weekly malaria passive case data were used to evaluate the change in the estimated malaria incidence rate and trends of temporal patterns of the estimated malaria incidence rate before and after interventions. An interrupted time series model with a cyclic second-order random walk structure periodic seasonal term was used to assess the impact of LSM on malaria incidence rate in the intervention and control settings. An upsurge in malaria cases occurred after 2020 at both the intervention and control sites. The temporal patterns of malaria incidence rate showed an increasing trend after the intervention. The ITS model depicted that the LSM has no impact in reducing the malaria incidence rate at both intervention site Dire Dawa [immediate impact = 1.462 (0.891, 2.035)], [Lasting impact = 0.003 (- 0.012, 0.018)], and Batu [Immediate impact 0.007 (- 0.235, 0.249), [Lasting impact = 0.008 (- 0.003, 0.013)]. An overall increasing trend in the malaria incidence rate was observed irrespective of the implementation of LSM in the urban settings of Ethiopia, where An. stephensi has been found. Further investigations and validations of the incorporation of LSM into control activities are warranted."

    "abstract": "Fetal growth restriction (FGR) caused by placental insufficiency is a major contributor to neonatal morbidity and mortality. There is currently no in utero treatment for placental insufficiency or FGR. The placenta serves as the vital communication, supply, exchange, and defense organ for the developing fetus and offers an excellent opportunity for therapeutic interventions. Here we show efficacy of repeated treatments of trophoblast-specific human insulin-like 1 growth factor (IGF1) gene therapy delivered in a non-viral, polymer nanoparticle to the placenta for the treatment of FGR. Using a guinea pig maternal nutrient restriction model (70% food intake) of FGR, nanoparticle-mediated IGF1 treatment was delivered to the placenta via ultrasound guidance across the second half of pregnancy, after establishment of FGR. This treatment resulted in correction of fetal weight in MNR + IGF1 animals compared to sham treated controls on an ad libitum diet, increased fetal blood glucose and decreased fetal blood cortisol levels compared to sham treated MNR, and showed no negative maternal side-effects. Overall, we show a therapy capable of positively impacting the entire pregnancy environment: maternal, placental, and fetal. This combined with our previous studies using this therapy at mid pregnancy in the guinea pig and in two different mouse model and three different human in vitro/ex vivo models, demonstrate the plausibility of this therapy for future human translation. Our overall goal is to improve health outcomes of neonates and decrease numerous morbidities associated with the developmental origins of disease."

Potential KD cases were identified from hospital discharge records, echocardiogram databases and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) dispensing databases. Clinical records were reviewed and international diagnostic criteria were applied retrospectively. A total of 161 cases of KD were identified (66.5% complete, 33.5% incomplete), with 84% aged under 5 years. Overall incidence (per 100 000/year under 5 years) was 20.4; this was highest in Asian (43.9) and Pacific (17.7) children. There was no significant difference in incidence between New Zealand European (10.1) and MÄori (8.3) children. The mean yearly number of cases reduced during the start of the COVID-19 pandemic (37.6 vs 24.0, p=0.01). All children received at least one infusion of IVIg, with 20.5% receiving a second infusion. Twenty-seven children (16.9%) developed CAA. CAA was more common in children under 1 year, non-response to first dose of IVIg and Pacific children. Incidence of KD and rate of CAA were higher than previously reported, although case numbers reduced during the COVID-19 pandemic. There was a high incidence of KD among Pacific children, who were most likely to develop CAA. Research focusing on strategies to identify and treat those at highest risk of CAA remains a priority."

    "abstract": "Proline-rich antimicrobial peptides (PrAMPs) have gained attention due to their antimicrobial properties and low cytotoxicity. B7-005, a small optimized PrAMP, exhibits a broader spectrum of activity than native PrAMPs, due to an antimicrobial mechanism based on inhibiting prokaryotic protein synthesis and destabilizing bacterial membranes. However, the toxicity and the <i>in vivo</i> efficacy of B7-005 remain poorly understood, so <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> microbiology and toxicology experiments were used to assess its suitability as an anti-infective agent. The incidence of resistance towards B7-005 by <i>E. coli</i> was lower than for other PrAMPs and antibiotics; moreover, it maintained antimicrobial activity in the presence of human serum. B7-005 exerted its antimicrobial effect at a much lower concentration than those causing harmful effects on four different cell types, such as membrane permeabilization or non-lytic depolarization of mitochondria. The latter effect may be related to the inhibition of eukaryotic protein synthesis by B7-005 observed <i>in vitro</i>. In a zebrafish embryo model, B7-005 was well tolerated and reduced mortality from pre-existing <i>E. coli</i> bacteraemia. Overall, B7-005 was safe for human cells and effective against systemic infection <i>in vivo</i>, making it a promising lead for developing new antibiotics."

We investigated the associations of early menopause, and serum adipokines with incident HF in postmenopausal women. We included 746 postmenopausal women from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis who reported their menopausal age and had data on adipokines and incident HF at the end of follow-up. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used for analysis. The mean age was 65.1 years. Over a median follow-up period of 17.8 years, 45 HF events occurred. After adjusting for waist circumference, other cardiovascular disease risk factors and myocardial infarction, the hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) of incident HF attributable to early menopause were 4.50 (1.41-14.3), 4.64 (1.46-14.7), and 5.16 (1.59-16.7) in models that additionally included adiponectin, leptin, and resistin, respectively. In adjusted analyses, adiponectin was independently associated with incident HF 2.20 (1.35-3.57), while leptin and resistin were not. The interaction terms of early menopause with adiponectin, leptin, and resistin for incident HF were not significant ( Pint = 0.08-0.82). Early menopause was significantly associated with incident HF. This association did not differ by serum adipokine levels.

Participants were adults aged 18 years or older hospitalized with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and hypoxemia. Data were analyzed between January 10 and March 8, 2024. Fostamatinib, 150 mg orally twice daily for 14 days, or placebo. The primary outcome was oxygen-free days, an ordinal outcome classifying a participant's status at day 28 based on mortality and duration of supplemental oxygen use. An adjusted odds ratio (AOR) greater than 1.0 was considered to indicate superiority of fostamatinib over placebo. A key secondary outcome was 28-day all-cause mortality. Safety outcomes included elevated transaminase values, neutropenia, and hypertension. Of the 400 participants randomized (median age, 67 years [IQR, 58-76 years]; 210 [52.5%] men), 199 received fostamatinib and 201 received placebo. The mean (SD) number of oxygen-free days was 13.4 (12.4) in the fostamatinib group and 14.2 (12.1) in the placebo group (unadjusted mean difference, -1.26 days [95% CI, -3.52 to 1.00 days]; AOR, 0.82 [95% credible interval (CrI), 0.58-1.17]).

The aim of the review was to examine how the condition and its management are influenced by the anatomical structures involved. The Medline and Ovid Embase online databases were searched for all papers relevant to MO between Jan 1972 and Dec 2020. Duplicate and unobtainable records were removed. The remaining records were manually assessed for relevance by three independent reviewers, initially by abstract and then by full-text screening, to ensure that all papers were suitable. Acceptance of articles was not limited by case features or study design. In total, 77 papers from the literature search were included. They contained information on 89 patients diagnosed with MO. The average age of the patients was 26.17 years (range 13 weeks to 72 years, a 71.75 year range) and 65.17% were male. The lower limb was affected more than the upper limb or spine, the most common site being the thigh. Muscle was the most commonly affected tissue, the quadricep femoris being most often involved. Diagnostic imaging varied widely among cases; X-ray alone was the most common method, followed by a combination of X-ray and MRI. Lesions in the lower limb had larger diameters than those in the upper limb or spine. More cases in the upper limb (47.83%) than in the lower limb (33.33%) required surgery. All instances of MO in the jaw, hand, and foot were symptomatic, and all required surgical management. The findings were consistent with previous research showing MO to be a predominantly male disease, with most patients being under 30 years of age. Trauma was involved in 52.81%, lower than previously reported. In this study, the vastus lateralis of the quadriceps was most often affected. MO lesions were less common and smaller in the upper limb but more required surgery. Anatomically confined sites such as the hand and foot always required surgery, probably because of earlier onset or more severe functional effects of symptoms. Further work is needed to review the anatomical predilection of MO to help identify patients who could benefit from earlier consideration of surgery. A national registry of MO cases could contribute to further research on this disease."

    "abstract": "The standard approach to catheter based left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) involves trans-esophageal echocardiography (TEE) guided screening and placement, and procedural general anesthesia requiring overnight stay. In pursuit of improved patient experience and reduced cost, streamlined approaches in each phase of care have been explored. However, the safety and clinical outcomes for a completely protocolized minimalist approach utilizing computed tomography angiogram (CTA), intracardiac echocardiography (ICE), conscious sedation, and same-day discharge are lacking. We retrospectively studied 179 patients undergoing LAAO for nonvalvular atrial fibrillation using a novel \"Minimalist\" pathway. Efficacy and safety endpoints included stroke, systemic embolism, major bleeding requiring transfusion, pericardial effusion, vascular complication, or death through 7 or 45 days post-procedure. The procedural success rate in Minimalist cases was 100%. A total of 159 patients (88.8%) were eligible for SDD. All patients survived to 45 days of follow up and there was a 0% incidence of stroke, systemic embolism, and vascular complications. There were low rates of DRT (1.3%) and peri-device flow (0.7%), yielding a high rate of safe OAC discontinuation. Using a pre-defined Minimalist pathway, eligible patients demonstrated excellent clinical outcomes comparable to those reported in national clinical registries, supporting use of our novel pathway to safely improve both patient experience and efficiency of care."

    "abstract": "To investigate the therapeutic mechanism of <i>Gandou Bushen</i> Decoction (GDBSD) for improving reproductive disorders in male mouse models of Wilson disease (WD). Sixty male homozygous TX mice were randomized equally into 4 groups and treated with daily gavage of saline (WD model group), penicillamine (0.09 g/kg), or GDBSD (0.2 mL/10 g), or with intraperitoneal injection of U0126 (20 mg/kg) in addition to GDBSD gavage, with 15 male DL mice as control. After 4 weeks of treatment, copper content in testicular tissue of the mice was detected, and histopathology of the testes and epididymis was examined using HE staining and electron microscopy. TUNEL staining was used to identify apoptotic cells in the testes. The protein expressions of Bcl-2, Cytc, caspase-3, ERK, and p-ERK in the testicular tissue were evaluated with Western blotting, and BrdU-positive cells were detected with immunohistochemical labeling. Sperm density, viability, malformation rate and fertility levels of male mice were studied. Treatment with penicillamine and GDBSD obviously improved pathological changes of the testis, increased sperm density and motility, lowered sperm abnormality rate, fertility levels and increased testicular JOHNSEN score of TK mice, but the therapeutic effect of GDBSD was blocked by U0126. GDBSD treatment significantly lowered Cytc and caspase-3 expressions and increased Bcl-2 expression in the testicular tissue of TX mice (<i>P</i> < 0.05), while U0126 treatment significantly lowered testicular Bcl-2 expression level. No significant differences were found in total protein expression levels of ERK1/2 among the 5 groups, but p-ERK protein expression was significantly reduced in WD and U0126 groups and increased in penicillamine and GDBSD groups. GDBSD can improve spermatogenesis and enhance fertility of male TX mice with WD possibly by activating the ERK signaling pathway to enhance proliferation and reduce apoptosis of the spermatogenic cells."

    "abstract": "Wilson's disease (WD) is a hereditary disorder characterized by an abnormality in copper metabolism. Liver fibrosis, and potentially cirrhosis, induced by copper accumulation are critical factors in the pathogenesis of WD. CircRNAs exhibit high stability and play crucial roles in numerous biological processes. RNA-seq technology was employed to conduct transcriptome sequencing of the liver from 12 homozygous (TX) mice in the model group (NL group) and 12 wild-type (WT) mice in the control group (N group). Differentially expressed circular RNAs (DE-circRNAs) were identified, and following GO and KEGG analysis, a competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) regulatory network was constructed. The identified DE-circRNAs were then randomly validated using RT-qPCR. Utilizing RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), the study identified 54 DE-circRNAs in TX-j mice with WD-induced liver fibrosis model, among which 19 were up-regulated and 35 were down-regulated. GO analysis revealed multiple biological processes, including single-organism process, cellular process, and metabolic process. Further pathway identification using KEGG implicated several pathways, including the HIF-1, PI3K-Akt, AMPK, FoxO, signaling pathway regulating pluripotency of stem cells, phospholipase D, mTOR, Ras, cGMP-PKG, and MAPK signaling pathway, among others. A ceRNA regulatory network was constructed with 20 circRNAs, 7 miRNAs, and 75 mRNAs as crucial core components. Additionally, RT-qPCR validation was performed on randomly selected DE-circRNAs, yielding consistent results (P<0.05). The findings provide a significant molecular biology foundation for understanding the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis in WD and offer new insights for exploring potential diagnostic and therapeutic targets."

    "title": "COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness against severe omicron-related outcomes in children aged 5 to 11Â years in Ontario: A Canadian immunization research network (CIRN) study.",
    "abstract": "Understanding how the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines translates from clinical trials to real-world settings is critical to inform evolving vaccination policies. The objective of this study was to assess COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness (VE) against severe COVID-19-related outcomes in children aged 5-11 years, including COVID-19-related hospital admissions and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). We conducted a retrospective, population-based cohort study using linked health administrative data in the first year following the emergence of the Omicron variant (January 2 to December 31, 2022) in Ontario, Canada. Baseline differences between subgroups of interest were compared using standardized differences. We used multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression models to estimate VE by time since last vaccine dose by treating vaccination as a time-varying exposure, compared to unvaccinated children. We included a total of 1,058,740 children, of which 583,867 (55.1 %) had received at least one vaccine dose by the end of the study period. In total, there were 185 COVID-19-related hospital admissions and 39 cases of MIS-C. The rate of COVID-19-related admission was substantially higher in children with an underlying comorbid condition compared to children who were previously healthy (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 4.77, 95 %CI, 3.56-6.38). VE against COVID-19-related admission ranged from 93 % (95 %CI, 52-99 %) 7-29 days after a second dose to 63 % (95 %CI; 41-77 %) â¥120 days after a second dose. There was no statistically significant difference in the rate of MIS-C in children who received at least one dose of the vaccine compared to unvaccinated children (aHR = 0.71; 95 %CI, 0.38-1.34). We found that, for children aged 5-11 years, VE against COVID-19-related hospitalization was high in the first four months after a second dose. Children with comorbid conditions were found to be at much higher risk of COVID-19-related severe outcomes and thus may benefit most from COVID-19 vaccination."

    "abstract": "Conventional methodologies are ineffective in predicting the rapid progression of knee osteoarthritis (OA). MicroRNAs (miRNAs) show promise as biomarkers for patient stratification. We aimed to develop a miRNA prognosis model for identifying knee OA structural progressors/non-progressors using integrated machine/deep learning tools. Baseline serum miRNAs from Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) participants were isolated and sequenced. Participants were categorized based on their likelihood of knee structural progression/non-progression using magnetic resonance imaging and X-ray data. For prediction model development, 152 OAI participants (91 progressors, 61 non-progressors) were used. MiRNA features were reduced through VarClusHi clustering. Key miRNAs and OA determinants (age, sex, body mass index, race) were identified using seven machine learning tools. The final prediction model was developed using advanced machine/deep learning techniques. Model performance was assessed with area under the curve (AUC) (95% confidence intervals) and accuracy. Monte Carlo cross-validation ensured robustness. Model validation used 30 OAI baseline plasma samples from an independent set of participants (14 progressors, 16 non-progressors). Feature clustering selected 107 miRNAs. Elastic Net was chosen for feature selection. An optimized prediction model based on an Artificial Neural Network comprising age and four miRNAs (hsa-miR-556-3p, hsa-miR-3157-5p, hsa-miR-200a-5p, hsa-miR-141-3p) exhibited excellent performance (AUC, 0.94 [0.89, 0.97]; accuracy, 0.84 [0.77, 0.89]). Model validation performance (AUC, 0.81 [0.63, 0.92]; accuracy, 0.83 [0.66, 0.93]) demonstrated the potential for generalization. This study introduces a novel miRNA prognosis model for knee OA patients at risk of structural progression. It requires five baseline features, demonstrates excellent performance, is validated with an independent set, and holds promise for future personalized therapeutic monitoring."

    "abstract": "The oral Janus kinase (JAK) 1/JAK2 inhibitor ruxolitinib was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2014 for treatment of patients with polycythemia vera (PV) who have an inadequate response to or intolerance of hydroxyurea (HU). PV is a chronic myeloproliferative neoplasm defined by primary absolute erythrocytosis, bone marrow hypercellularity, and JAK mutations such as JAK2V617F. Patients with PV experience burdensome symptoms and are at risk of thromboembolic events, in particular those with resistance to or intolerance of initial treatments such as HU. Other risks for patients with PV include progression of disease to more aggressive forms with worse prognoses, such as myelofibrosis or blast-phase myeloproliferative neoplasms. This review summarizes the efficacy and safety of ruxolitinib from key phase 2 and 3 trials (MAJIC-PV, RESPONSE, RESPONSE-2, RELIEF, and Ruxo-BEAT), large real-world studies, and a decade of postmarketing surveillance safety data. The authors focus on improved blood count control, rates of thromboembolic events, symptom improvement, and markers of disease modification such as reduction of JAK2V617F allele burden in patients treated with ruxolitinib. They also discuss the well-characterized safety profile of ruxolitinib regarding hematologic and other adverse events of interest. In the 10 years since its approval, ruxolitinib remains a safe and effective standard-of-care treatment for PV. As the treatment landscape for PV continues to evolve in the coming years, the efficacy and safety profiles of ruxolitinib suggest it will remain a preferred treatment as monotherapy and as a potential backbone of future combination regimens."

    "abstract": "The evolving landscape of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) necessitates refining colonoscopic surveillance guidelines. This study outlines methodology adopted by the British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) Guideline Development Group (GDG) for updating IBD colorectal surveillance guidelines. The 'Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation' (GRADE) approach, as outlined in the GRADE handbook, was employed. Thematic questions were formulated using either the 'patient, intervention, comparison and outcome' format or the 'current state of knowledge, area of interest, potential impact and suggestions from experts in the field' format. The evidence review process included systematic reviews assessed using appropriate appraisal tools. An extensive list of potential outcomes was compiled from literature and expert consultations and then ranked by GDG members. The top outcomes were identified for evidence synthesis in three key areas: utility of surveillance in IBD, quality of bowel preparation and use of advanced imaging techniques in colonoscopy for IBD. Risk thresholding exercises determined specific risk levels for different surveillance strategies and intervals. This approach enabled the GDG to establish precise thresholds for interventions based on relative and absolute risk assessments, directly informing the stratification of surveillance recommendations. Significance of effect sizes (small, moderate, large) will guide the final GRADE assessment of the evidence. Ethics approval is not applicable. By integrating clinical expertise, patient experiences and innovative methodologies like risk thresholding, we aim to deliver actionable recommendations for IBD colorectal surveillance. This protocol, complementing the main guidelines, offers GDGs, clinical trialists and practitioners a framework to inform future research and enhance patient care and outcomes."

    "title": "Molecular leveraging of HOX-embedded non-coding RNAs in the progression of acute myeloid leukemia.",
    "abstract": "Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is characterized by impaired differentiation of myeloid cells leading to hematopoietic failure. Despite advances, the molecular mechanisms driving AML remain incompletely understood, limiting the identification and targeting of critical vulnerabilities in leukemic cells. Homeobox (HOX) genes, encoding transcription factors essential for myeloid and lymphoid differentiation, are distributed across four clusters: HOXA (chromosome 7), HOXB (chromosome 17), HOXC (chromosome 12), and HOXD (chromosome 2). In addition to protein-coding sequences, HOX clusters encode non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), which are functional as transcripts and do not translate into proteins. This is the first study wherein we comprehensively reviewed the literature for HOX-embedded ncRNAs, encompassing long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), microRNAs, circular RNAs (circRNAs), and piwiRNAs with a role in AML. To date, there is no evidence of circular RNAs and piwi RNAs encoded from the HOX gene clusters. Our review focuses on how leukemic cells harness the regulatory mechanisms of HOX-cluster-derived ncRNAs, (predominantly HOXA and HOXB) to modulate expression of HOX transcription factors facilitating leukemogenesis. HOX ncRNAs either regulate genes on the same chromosome (e.g., lncRNA HOTTIP) or influence expression of genes on different chromosomes (e.g., HOTAIR, HOX10-AS, miR-196b, and miR-10a). We discuss how specific HOX ncRNA networks are leveraged by leukemic cells, presenting an opportunity to explore targeted therapies and address the molecular heterogeneity of AML. Additionally, the aberrant expression of HOX ncRNAs such as HOXB derived ncRNAs in NPM1 mutated AML suggests their potential utility as improved biomarkers and for prognostication of patients with specific molecular aberrations."

    "abstract": "A significant shift toward virtual care has occurred for many patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). To date, there are no prospective studies assessing patients visits across different styles of appointments. We randomized IBD patients' appointments to in-person, video-assisted virtual, or telephone and subsequent appointments to the alternate style of visit in a single-center study in Victoria, Canada. Participants completed surveys after each appointment. Demographic data were collected and average scores were analyzed for potential associations. Forty-one patients were randomized to appointments, and 86 post-appointment surveys were completed, 30 in-person, 29 telephone, and 27 telehealth. The average age was 46.5 Â± 18 years and 59% were female. The overall patient score (out of ten) by appointment type was 9.1 Â± 1.0 for in-person, 7.8 Â± 2.1 for telephone, and 8.0 Â± 2.6 for telehealth without a statistically significant difference. While there was only a near statistically significant preference for in-person appointments compared with telehealth p = 0.055, it was statistically significant when comparing with phone appointments p = 0.014. The highest rated factors for preference of an in-person appointment were optimal communication and interaction with care provider (86%). For patients who preferred telehealth or telephone appointments, the highest rated factors were time and cost savings (71%, 43% and 58%, 33%, respectively). In-person appointments were associated with a significantly higher cost (p < 0.01), and longer time commitment. Despite the increased cost and time commitment, in-person appointments were highly rated particularly in comparison to phone appointments. Based on this research, providers can be better informed on factors contributing to patients' preferred appointment style."

The impact of iDiabetes will be evaluated through a cluster-randomised controlled study, recruiting up to 22 500 patients with diabetes. Primary care general practices (GPs) in the National Health Service (NHS) Scotland Tayside Health Board are the units (clusters) of randomisation. Each primary care GP will form one cluster (approximately 400 patients per cluster), with up to 60 clusters recruited. Randomisation will be to <i>iDiabetes (guideline support</i>), <i>iDiabetesPlus</i> or <i>usual diabetes care</i> (control arm). Patients of participating primary care GPs are automatically enrolled on the study when they attend for their annual diabetes screening or are newly diagnosed with diabetes. A composite hierarchical primary outcome, evaluated using Win-Ratio statistical methodology, will consist of (1) all-cause mortality, (2) all-cause hospitalisation rate, (3) proportion with >40% estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] reduction from baseline or new development of end-stage renal disease, (4) proportion with absolute HbA1C reduction >0.5%. Outcomes will be evaluated after a 2-year median follow-up period. Comprehensive qualitative and health economic analyses will be conducted, assessing the cost-effectiveness, budget impact and user acceptability of the iDiabetes platform.

    "abstract": "Environmental changes may alter gene expression in depression and anxiety disorders through epigenetic regulation, including via small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs) and their major subclass, microRNAs (miRNAs). However, underlying mechanisms mediating miRNA regulation in response to changing environmental stimuli are unclear. Using the serotonin transporter (5-HTT) knockout (KO) mouse model of depression/anxiety, this study aimed to compare the effects of voluntary exercise (EX) versus chronic treatment with the stress hormone corticosterone (CT), on hippocampal miRNA transcriptome and proteome in five comparison groups: WT-SH vs. KO-SH; WT-SH vs. WT-EX; KO-SH vs. KO-EX; WT-SH vs. WT-CT; KO-SH vs. KO-CT. We hypothesized that treatment with stress hormone will result in miRNA and proteomics changes observed in genetic model of depression, while exercise will have beneficial effects similar to antidepressant treatment. Using high-throughput sequencing of miRNAs and mass spectrometry (MS)-based approaches for protein expression, we revealed 337 differentially expressed (DE) miRNAs and 67 proteins in 5-HTT KO mice compared to wild-type (WT) control mice in standard-housing conditions. After exercise, there were 200 DE miRNAs and 3 DE proteins in WT mice, and 20 DE miRNAs and 95 DE proteins in 5-HTT KO mice, while corticosterone treatment led to 168 DE miRNAs and 1 DE protein in WT, and 21 DE miRNAs and 21 DE proteins in 5-HTT KO mice. Serotonergic dysfunction (due to the 5-HTT KO gene mutation) induced altered expression of miRNAs and proteins involved in regulation of neurodevelopment, neurogenesis and neuroinflammatory responses. Treatment with the stress hormone corticosterone in WT mice activated pathways which were also found altered in 5-HTT KO mice, while exercise caused antidepressant-like effects. These findings suggest that functional 5-HTT might be required for the beneficial effects of exercise on miRNA expression. Our study is the first to explore how gene-environment interactions affect miRNA/proteomic composition in a mouse model of depression/anxiety, and extends our understanding of gene-environmental interactions underlying these affective disorders."

    "title": "Purinergic P2Y<sub>1</sub> and P2Y<sub>12</sub> receptors control enteric nervous system activity through neuro-glia-macrophage crosstalk.",
    "abstract": "Purines are important mediators of intercellular communication in the enteric nervous system (ENS) that participate in physiological gut functions and disease. Purinergic transmission is prominent in mechanisms of crosstalk between enteric neurons and glia where enteric glia exhibit high responsiveness to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) through P2Y<sub>1</sub> receptors and neurons to adenosine triphosphate (ATP) through P2X<sub>3</sub> receptors. Despite functional data suggesting that enteric glia are the primary site of P2Y<sub>1</sub> expression in the ENS, gene sequencing suggests that P2Y<sub>1</sub> expression is more enriched in neurons than glia. The reason for the mismatch between genomic and functional data is unclear but could involve co-expression of inhibitory P2Y<sub>12</sub> receptors in neurons. We addressed this issue by studying the expression and function of P2Y<sub>1</sub> and P2Y<sub>12</sub> receptors in the mouse ENS using live immunolabeling and calcium imaging techniques. The data show that ADP drives activity among enteric glia and neurons in the myenteric plexus. Interestingly, inhibiting P2Y<sub>12</sub> activity increased neuron responses to ADP and overall spontaneous activity among enteric neurons and glia while decreasing the magnitude of glial responses to ADP. Investigating the location of the receptors involved revealed P2Y<sub>1</sub> receptor expression by both neurons and glia, while P2Y<sub>12</sub> receptor expression was minimal in the ENS. Instead, P2Y<sub>12</sub> expression was enriched in the surrounding muscularis macrophages. Macrophages positive for P2Y<sub>12</sub> overlapped with CD163 positive subsets that have known inhibitory influences over myenteric neurocircuits. Together, these data suggest that macrophage P2Y<sub>12</sub> pathways act to constrain activity in the ENS, which could have implications in mechanisms that contribute to enteric hyperexcitability following disease."

    "abstract": "Coadministration of a respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine with seasonal influenza or SARS-CoV-2 vaccines could reduce health-care visits and increase vaccination uptake in older adults who are at high risk for severe respiratory disease. The RSV mRNA-1345 vaccine demonstrated efficacy against RSV disease with acceptable safety in the ConquerRSV trial in adults aged 60 years and older. We aimed to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of mRNA-1345 coadministered with a seasonal influenza vaccine or SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine. We conducted a two-part, phase 3, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomised trial in medically stable adults aged 50 years or older in the USA. In part A, participants were randomly assigned in a 7:10:10 ratio to receive 50 Î¼g mRNA-1345 plus placebo (0Â·9% sodium chloride) or coadministered with 60 Î¼g of a standard-dose quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (SIIV4), or SIIV4 plus placebo. In part B, participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive 50 Î¼g mRNA-1345 plus placebo or coadministered with 50 Î¼g SARS-CoV-2 mRNA-1273.214 (bivalent [Wuhan-Hu-1 plus omicron BA.1]), or mRNA-1273.214 plus placebo. Random allocation in both parts was stratified by age group (50-59 years, 60-74 years, and â¥75 years) and used interactive response technology. The coprimary objectives in each part were safety in the safety set throughout the study and non-inferiority for six immunogenicity endpoints in the per-protocol set comparing coadministered versus individual vaccines on day 29. Immunogenicity endpoints were geometric mean titre (GMT) ratios (GMRs) of RSV-A neutralising antibodies (nAbs; in parts A and B), GMRs of haemagglutination inhibition (HAI) titres to each of the four influenza strains in SIIV4 (A/Victoria/2570/2019 [H1N1]pdm09-like virus [A/H1N1], A/Cambodia/e0826360/2020 [H3N2]-like virus [A/H3N2], B/Washington/02/2019-like virus [B/Victoria], and B/Phuket/3073/2013-like virus [B/Yamagata]; in part A), GMRs of nAbs against SARS-CoV-2 (ancestral [D614G] and omicron BA.1; part B), and differences in seroresponse rates for nAbs against RSV-A (parts A and B) and SARS-CoV-2 (ancestral [D614G] and omicron BA.1; part B). Non-inferiority was declared when the lower bound of the 95% CI for GMRs was greater than 0Â·667 and for seroresponse rate differences was greater than -10%. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05330975) and is ongoing. Between April 1 and June 9, 2022, 1631 participants were randomly allocated in part A and 1623 received vaccinations on day 1 (685 [42%] received mRNA-1345 plus SIIV4, 249 [15%] mRNA-1345 plus placebo, and 689 [42%] SIIV4 plus placebo). Due to an interactive response technology error, the mRNA-1345 plus placebo group was smaller than planned (249 vs 420 participants). Of the 1623 participants in the safety set, 877 (54%) were female and 746 (46%) were male. Between July 27 and Sept 28, 2022, 1691 participants were randomly allocated in part B and 1681 received vaccinations on day 1 (564 [34%] received mRNA-1345 plus mRNA-1273.214, 558 [33%] mRNA-1345 plus placebo, and 559 [33%] mRNA-1273.214 plus placebo). Among the 1681 participants in the safety set, 924 (55%) were female and 757 (45%) were male. The reactogenicity profiles of the coadministered regimens were generally similar to the profiles when the vaccines were administered alone. As of the 6-month and 7-month follow-up times for parts A and B, respectively, no serious adverse events, adverse events of special interest, discontinuations due to adverse events, or fatal events considered related to study vaccination were reported. In part A, the GMR of nAbs against RSV-A in the mRNA-1345 plus SIIV4 group versus the mRNA-1345 alone group was 0Â·81 (95% CI 0Â·67 to 0Â·97), and the seroresponse rate difference in nAbs against RSV-A between the groups was -11Â·2% (95% CI -17Â·9 to -4Â·1). GMRs of anti-HAI titres in the mRNA-1345 plus SIIV4 versus SIIV4 alone groups were 0Â·89 (0Â·77 to 1Â·03) for A/H1N1, 0Â·97 (0Â·86 to 1Â·09) for A/H3N2, 0Â·93 (0Â·82 to 1Â·05) for B/Victoria, and 0Â·91 (0Â·81 to 1Â·02) for B/Yamagata. In part B, the GMR of nAbs against RSV-A in the mRNA-1345 plus mRNA-1273.214 versus the mRNA-1345 alone groups was 0Â·80 (95% CI 0Â·70 to 0Â·90), and the seroresponse rate difference was -4Â·4% (95% CI -9Â·9 to 1Â·0). Comparing the mRNA-1345 plus mRNA-1273.214 group with the mRNA-1273.214 alone group, the GMR of nAbs was 0Â·96 (0Â·87 to 1Â·06) for the ancestral (D614G) virus and 1Â·00 (0Â·89 to 1Â·14) for omicron BA.1; seroresponse rate differences were 0Â·2% (95% CI -6Â·0 to 6Â·3) for SARS-CoV-2 ancestral and -0Â·9% (-6Â·6 to 4Â·7) for omicron BA.1. Coadministered mRNA-1345 plus SIIV4 or mRNA-1273.214 vaccines had acceptable safety profiles and elicited mostly non-inferior immune responses compared to individual vaccines in adults aged 50 years or older; only the seroresponse rate difference in nAbs against RSV-A in part A did not meet the non-inferiority criterion. Overall, these data support coadministration of mRNA-1345 with these vaccines in this population; longer-term evaluation continues in this study. Moderna."

    "title": "Dysregulated acetylcholine-mediated dopamine neurotransmission in the eIF4E Tg mouse model of autism spectrum disorders.",
    "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) consists of diverse neurodevelopmental conditions where core behavioral symptoms are critical for diagnosis. Altered dopamine (DA) neurotransmission in the striatum has been suggested to contribute to the behavioral features of ASD. Here, we examine DA neurotransmission in a mouse model of ASD characterized by elevated expression of eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), a key regulator of cap-dependent translation, using a comprehensive approach that encompasses genetics, behavior, synaptic physiology, and imaging. The results indicate that increased eIF4E expression leads to behavioral inflexibility and impaired striatal DA release. The loss of normal DA neurotransmission is due to a defect in nicotinic receptor signaling that regulates calcium dynamics in dopaminergic axons. These findings provide a mechanistic understanding of ASD symptoms and offer a foundation for targeted therapeutic interventions by revealing the intricate interplay between eIF4E, DA neurotransmission, and behavioral flexibility."

A multicenter US observational sentinel surveillance network prospectively enrolled adults (aged â¥18 years) hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed influenza at 24 hospitals during October 1, 2022-July 21, 2023. A multivariable proportional odds model was used to compare peak pulmonary disease severity (no oxygen support, standard supplemental oxygen, high-flow oxygen/non-invasive ventilation, invasive mechanical ventilation, or death) after the day of hospital admission among patients starting oseltamivir treatment on the day of admission (early) versus those who did not (late or not treated), adjusting for baseline (admission day) severity, age, sex, site, and vaccination status. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to evaluate the odds of intensive care unit (ICU) admission, acute kidney replacement therapy or vasopressor use, and in-hospital death. A total of 840 influenza-positive patients were analyzed, including 415 (49%) who started oseltamivir treatment on the day of admission, and 425 (51%) who did not. Compared with late or not treated patients, those treated early had lower peak pulmonary disease severity (proportional aOR: 0.60, 95% CI: 0.49-0.72), and lower odds of intensive care unit admission (aOR: 0.24, 95% CI: 0.13-0.47), acute kidney replacement therapy or vasopressor use (aOR: 0.40, 95% CI: 0.22-0.67), and in-hospital death (aOR: 0.36, 95% CI: 0.18-0.72). Among adults hospitalized with influenza, treatment with oseltamivir on day of hospital admission was associated reduced risk of disease progression, including pulmonary and extrapulmonary organ failure and death."

    "abstract": "The association of overall cardiovascular health (CVH) with changes in DNA methylation (DNAm) has not been well characterized. We calculated the American Heart Association's Life's Essential 8 (LE8) score to reflect CVH in five cohorts with diverse ancestry backgrounds. Epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) for LE8 score were conducted, followed by bioinformatic analyses. DNAm loci significantly associated with LE8 score were used to calculate a CVH DNAm score. We examined the association of the CVH DNAm score with incident CVD, CVD-specific mortality, and all-cause mortality. We identified 609 CpGs associated with LE8 score at false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05 in the discovery analysis and at Bonferroni corrected <i>P</i> < 0.05 in the multi-cohort replication stage. Most had low-to-moderate heterogeneity (414 CpGs [68.0%] with I<sup>2</sup> < 0.2) in replication analysis. Pathway enrichment analyses and phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) search associated these CpGs with inflammatory or autoimmune phenotypes. We observed enrichment for phenotypes in the EWAS catalog, with 29-fold enrichment for stroke (<i>P</i> = 2.4e-15) and 21-fold for ischemic heart disease (<i>P</i> = 7.4e-38). Two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis showed significant association between 141 CpGs and ten phenotypes (261 CpG-phenotype pairs) at FDR < 0.05. For example, hypomethylation at cg20544516 (<i>MIR33B</i>; <i>SREBF1</i>) associated with lower risk of stroke (<i>P</i> = 8.1e-6). In multivariable prospective analyses, the CVH DNAm score was consistently associated with clinical outcomes across participating cohorts, the reduction in risk of incident CVD, CVD mortality, and all-cause mortality per standard deviation increase in the DNAm score ranged from 19% to 32%, 28% to 40%, and 27% to 45%, respectively. We identified new DNAm signatures for CVH across diverse cohorts. Our analyses indicate that immune response-related pathways may be the key mechanism underpinning the association between CVH and clinical outcomes."

All patients diagnosed with RPS from 2010 to 2021 that underwent surgical resection in a single trust in Northern Ireland were identified. Data was collated using histopathology records, electronic care records and retrospective chart review. Fifty-four resections were performed for RPS in a 10 year period. 30 day mortality rate was 3.7%, in-hospital mortality was 1.9% and 90 day mortality was 7.4%. 11.1% of patients were recorded as having a severe postoperative adverse event. 90.4% patients achieved an R0/R1 resection. The 1, 3, and 5-year overall survival were 80% [95% confidence interval (CI) 67-89), 69% (95% CI 53-79), and 62% (95% CI 48-75). The 1 and 5-year crude-cumulative-incidence (CCI) for local recurrence were 32% (95%CI 20, 46) and 55% (95%CI 32,77). 1 and 5-year CCI for distant metastases were 11% (95%CI 4, 23) and 35% (95%CI 15,59). Median overall survival was 6.3 years (IQR 5.0-7.6). Survival outcomes in this LVH are similar to those reported by a number of HVHs worldwide, with an additional low rate of severe postoperative complication. Given that there are only between 250 and 300 new diagnoses of retroperitoneal sarcoma (RPS) in the UK each year prospective data collection and participation in multi-institution studies, specifically a UK collaboration, is critical to expand upon current knowledge and further improve management, outcomes and follow-up of patients with this rare and complex surgical disease."

    "abstract": "Chronic viral infections are ubiquitous in humans, with individuals harboring multiple latent viruses that can reactivate during acute illnesses. Recent studies have suggested that SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to reactivation of latent viruses such as Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV), yet, the extent and impact of viral reactivation in COVID-19 and its effect on the host immune system remain incompletely understood. Here we present a comprehensive multi-omic analysis of viral reactivation of all known chronically infecting viruses in 1,154 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, from the Immunophenotyping Assessment in a COVID-19 Cohort (IMPACC) study, who were followed prospectively for twelve months. We reveal significant reactivation of <i>Herpesviridae</i>, <i>Enteroviridae</i>, and <i>Anelloviridae</i> families during acute stage of COVID-19 (0-40 days post-hospitalization), each exhibiting distinct temporal dynamics. We also show that viral reactivation correlated with COVID-19 severity, demographic characteristics, and clinical outcomes, including mortality. Integration of cytokine profiling, cellular immunophenotyping, metabolomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics demonstrated virus-specific host responses, including elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL-6, CXCL10, and TNF), increased activated CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, and upregulation of cellular replication genes, independent of COVID-19 severity and SARS-CoV-2 viral load. Notably, persistent <i>Anelloviridae</i> reactivation during convalescence (â¥3 months post-hospitalization) was associated with Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) symptoms, particularly physical function and fatigue. Our findings highlight a remarkable prevalence and potential impact of chronic viral reactivation on host responses and clinical outcomes during acute COVID-19 and long term PASC sequelae. Our data provide novel immune, transcriptomic, and metabolomic biomarkers of viral reactivation that may inform novel approaches to prognosticate, prevent, or treat acute COVID-19 and PASC."

    "abstract": "<b><i>Introduction:</i></b> Breastfeeding is associated with improved health outcomes. Several social drivers of health impact breastfeeding initiation (BFI). Prior research using ecological data demonstrated that food desert residence (FDR) is associated with lower rates of BFI. The primary objective was to assess the relationship between FDR and BFI using individual-level data. The secondary objective was to assess the relationship between FDR and BFI at the county level. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> Individual-level birth data from the Florida Department of Health were linked to food access data from the United States Department of Agriculture Food Access Research Atlas in 2010, 2015, and 2019. Food deserts were identified per the United States Department of Agriculture definition. Adjusted risk ratios (aRR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using modified Poisson regression models in 573,368 births. Models were adjusted for confounders and stratified by race/ethnicity. We assessed the association between the percent of the population in low-income and low-access census tracts aggregated to the county level and the percent of mothers initiating breastfeeding per county in Florida (Center for Disease Control and Prevention) using Pearson's correlation and a bivariate map. <b><i>Results:</i></b> FDR was associated with BFI (aRR: 1.23, CI: 1.20-1.27). The adjusted risk of not-initiating breastfeeding for those living in a food desert was greatest among non-Hispanic Black women (aRR: 1.29, CI: 1.24-1.35) and Hispanic women (aRR: 1.29, CI: 1.21-1.37). Maternal education was the most significant predictor of BFI. Women who had 9th through 12th-grade education but without a diploma were five times (aRR: 4.96, CI: 4.72-5.20) less likely to initiate breastfeeding relative to college graduates. There was no association between FDR and BFI at the county level, though regional trends were noted. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> FDR is an important risk factor for not-initiating breastfeeding. Among Floridians, education was the most significant risk factor. Understanding how FDR influences breastfeeding can help target interventions to improve breastfeeding outcomes."

TRT improves tumor control while minimizing damage to healthy tissue and extends the survival for patients with cancer. The application of theranostic-paired TRT along with cellular phenotype and genotype correlative analysis has the potential for malignant disease management. Chelation chemistry is essential for the development of theranostic-paired radiopharmaceuticals for TRT. Among image-guided TRT, <sup>68</sup>Ga and <sup>99m</sup>Tc are the current standards for diagnostic radionuclides, while <sup>177</sup>Lu and <sup>225</sup>Ac have shown great promise for Î²- and Î±-TRT, respectively. Their long half-lives, potent radiobiology, favorable decay schemes, and ability to form stable chelation conjugates make them ideal for both manufacturing and clinical use. The current challenges include optimizing radionuclide production processes, coordinating chelation chemistry stability of theranostic-paired isotopes to reduce free daughters [this pertains to <sup>225</sup>Ac daughters <sup>221</sup>Fr and <sup>213</sup>Bi]-induced tissue toxicity, and improving the modeling of micro dosimetry to refine dose-response evaluation. The empirical approach to TRT delivery is based on standard radionuclide administered activity levels, although clinical trials have revealed inconsistent outcomes and normal-tissue toxicities despite equivalent administered activities.

Liver transplantation (LT) has improved survival rates, with U.S. rates reaching 92%. This study analyzes UNOS data (2002-2020) to evaluate long-term survival and identify risk factors affecting waitlist and post-LT outcomes in ALF patients. <b>Methods</b>: A retrospective analysis was performed on adult ALF patients waitlisted for LT (Status 1/1A). ALF etiologies, including viral infections, drug-induced liver injury (DILI), acetaminophen (APAP) overdose, autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), Wilson disease (WD), and unknown causes, were assessed with patient and donor characteristics. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses identified predictors of patient and graft survival. Sensitivity analysis confirmed the model's robustness. <b>Results</b>: We identified 2759 ALF patients. APAP (HR 1.7; <i>p</i> < 0.001) and unknown etiology (HR 1.3; <i>p</i> = 0.037) were linked to higher waitlist removal risk, while WD (HR 0.36; <i>p</i> < 0.001) increased LT probability. Among 2014 LT recipients, WD showed improved survival (HR 0.53; <i>p</i> = 0.002). Black/African American race (HR 1.47; <i>p</i> < 0.001), diabetes (HR 1.81; <i>p</i> < 0.001), and encephalopathy (HR 1.27; <i>p</i> < 0.001) predicted higher mortality.

The Duffy chemokine receptor is not expressed on erythrocytes in a large majority of Black adults, but the clinical implications of this are unclear. <b>Methods:</b> Here, we investigated the relationship of Duffy receptor status, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and mortality and incident CVD events (coronary heart disease, stroke, and heart failure) in self-identified Black members of three contemporary, longitudinal cohort studies (the Women's Health Initiative, Jackson Heart Study, and Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis). Data on 14,358 Black participants (9023 Duffy-null and 5335 Duffy-receptor-positive, as defined using single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs2814778) were included in this analysis. <b>Results:</b> Duffy null was strongly associated with higher hs-CRP (meta-analysis <i>p</i> = 2.62 Ã 10<sup>-9</sup>), but the association was largely attenuated, though still marginally significant (<i>p</i> = 0.005), after conditioning on known <i>CRP</i> locus alleles in linkage disequilibrium with the Duffy gene. In our discovery cohorts, Duffy-null status appeared to be associated with a higher risk of all-cause mortality and incident stroke, though these associations were attenuated and non-significant following adjustment for traditional risk factors including hs-CRP. Moreover, the association of Duffy-null status with mortality could not be replicated in an independent sample of Black adults from the UK Biobank. <b>Conclusions:</b> These findings suggest that the higher levels of hs-CRP found in Duffy-null individuals may be in part independent of CRP alleles known to influence circulating levels of hs-CRP. During the follow-up of this community-based sample of Black participants, Duffy-null status was not associated with mortality or incident CVD events independently of traditional risk factors including hs-CRP."

    "abstract": "Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism. The genetic defect in WD affects the <i>ATP7B</i> gene, which encodes the ATP7B transmembrane protein, which is essential for maintaining normal copper homeostasis in the body. It is primarily expressed in the liver and acts by incorporating copper into ceruloplasmin (Cp), the major copper transport protein in the blood. In conditions of excess copper, ATP7B transports it to bile for excretion. Mutations in <i>ATP7B</i> lead to impaired ATP7B function, resulting in copper accumulation in hepatocytes leading to their damage. The toxic \"free\"-unbound to Cp-copper released from hepatocytes then accumulates in various organs, contributing to their damage and clinical manifestations of WD, including hepatic, neurological, hematological, renal, musculoskeletal, ophthalmological, psychiatric, and other effects. While most clinical manifestations of WD correspond to identifiable organic or cellular damage, the pathophysiology underlying its psychiatric manifestations remains less clearly understood. A search for relevant articles was conducted in PubMed/Medline, Science Direct, Scopus, Willy Online Library, and Google Scholar, combining free text and MeSH terms using a wide range of synonyms and related terms, including \"Wilson's disease\", \"hepatolenticular degeneration\", \"psychiatric manifestations\", \"molecular mechanisms\", \"pathomechanism\", and others, as well as their combinations. Psychiatric symptoms of WD include cognitive disorders, personality and behavioral disorders, mood disorders, psychosis, and other mental disorders. They are not strictly related to the location of brain damage, therefore, the question arises whether these symptoms are caused by WD or are simply a coincidence or a reaction to the diagnosis of a genetic disease. Hypotheses regarding the etiology of psychiatric symptoms of WD suggest a variety of molecular mechanisms, including copper-induced CNS toxicity, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, mitophagy, cuproptosis, ferroptosis, dysregulation of neurotransmission, deficiencies of neurotrophic factors, or immune dysregulation. New studies on the expression of noncoding RNA in WD are beginning to shed light on potential molecular pathways involved in psychiatric symptomatology. However, current evidence is still insufficient to definitively establish the cause of psychiatric symptoms in WD. It is possible that the etiology of psychiatric symptoms varies among individuals, with multiple biological and psychological mechanisms contributing to them simultaneously. Future studies with larger samples and comprehensive analyses are necessary to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the psychiatric manifestations of WD and to optimize diagnostics and therapeutic approaches."

In an ideal world, there would be sufficient experimental data to determine the health effects of exposure to priority environmental contaminants. However, this is not the case, as emerging chemicals are continuously added to this list, furthering the data gaps. Recently, simulation science has evolved and can provide appropriate solutions using a multitude of computational methods and tools. In its quest to protect communities across the country from environmental health threats, ATSDR employs a variety of simulation science tools such as Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling, Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) modeling, and benchmark dose (BMD) modeling, among others. ATSDR's use of such tools has enabled the agency to evaluate exposures in a timely, efficient, and effective manner. ATSDR's work in simulation science has also had a notable impact beyond the agency, as evidenced by external researchers' widespread appraisal and adaptation of the agency's methodology.

We randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, patients with localized muscle-invasive bladder cancer of clinical stage T2 (confined to muscle) to T4a (invading adjacent organs) with two or fewer positive nodes (N0, N1, or N2) to undergo bilateral standard lymphadenectomy (dissection of lymph nodes on both sides of the pelvis) or extended lymphadenectomy involving removal of common iliac, presciatic, and presacral nodes. Randomization was performed during surgery and stratified according to the receipt and type of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, tumor stage (T2 vs. T3 or T4a), and a Zubrod's performance-status score (0 or 1 vs. 2; assessed on a 5-point scale, with higher scores indicating greater disability). The primary outcome was disease-free survival. Overall survival and safety were also assessed. Of 658 patients who were enrolled, 592 eligible patients were randomly assigned to undergo extended lymphadenectomy (292 patients) or standard lymphadenectomy (300). Surgery was performed by 36 surgeons at 27 sites in the United States and Canada. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy had been received by 57% of the patients. At a median follow-up of 6.1 years, recurrence or death had occurred in 130 patients (45%) in the extended-lymphadenectomy group and in 127 (42%) in the standard-lymphadenectomy group, and the estimated 5-year disease-free survival was 56% and 60%, respectively (hazard ratio for recurrence or death, 1.10; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.86 to 1.40; P = 0.45). Overall survival at 5 years was 59% in the extended-lymphadenectomy group and 63% in the standard-lymphadenectomy group (hazard ratio for death, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.88 to 1.45). Adverse events of grade 3 to 5 occurred in 157 patients (54%) in the extended-lymphadenectomy group and in 132 (44%) in the standard-lymphadenectomy group; death within 90 days after surgery occurred in 19 patients (7%) and 7 patients (2%), respectively. As compared with standard lymphadenectomy, extended lymphadenectomy did not result in improved disease-free or overall survival among patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer undergoing radical cystectomy and was associated with higher perioperative morbidity and mortality.

    "title": "Copper homeostasis and neurodegenerative diseases.",
    "abstract": "Copper, one of the most prolific transition metals in the body, is required for normal brain physiological activity and allows various functions to work normally through its range of concentrations. Copper homeostasis is meticulously maintained through a complex network of copper-dependent proteins, including copper transporters (CTR1 and CTR2), the two copper ion transporters the Cu -transporting ATPase 1 (ATP7A) and Cu-transporting beta (ATP7B), and the three copper chaperones ATOX1, CCS, and COX17. Disruptions in copper homeostasis can lead to either the deficiency or accumulation of copper in brain tissue. Emerging evidence suggests that abnormal copper metabolism or copper binding to various proteins, including ceruloplasmin and metallothionein, is involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders. However, the exact mechanisms underlying these processes are not known. Copper is a potent oxidant that increases reactive oxygen species production and promotes oxidative stress. Elevated reactive oxygen species levels may further compromise mitochondrial integrity and cause mitochondrial dysfunction. Reactive oxygen species serve as key signaling molecules in copper-induced neuroinflammation, with elevated levels activating several critical inflammatory pathways. Additionally, copper can bind aberrantly to several neuronal proteins, including alpha-synuclein, tau, superoxide dismutase 1, and huntingtin, thereby inducing neurotoxicity and ultimately cell death. This study focuses on the latest literature evaluating the role of copper in neurodegenerative diseases, with a particular focus on copper-containing metalloenzymes and copper-binding proteins in the regulation of copper homeostasis and their involvement in neurodegenerative disease pathogenesis. By synthesizing the current findings on the functions of copper in oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and protein misfolding, we aim to elucidate the mechanisms by which copper contributes to a wide range of hereditary and neuronal disorders, such as Wilson's disease, Menkes' disease, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington's disease, and multiple sclerosis. Potential clinically significant therapeutic targets, including superoxide dismutase 1, D-penicillamine, and 5,7-dichloro-2-[(dimethylamino)methyl]-8-hydroxyquinoline, along with their associated therapeutic agents, are further discussed. Ultimately, we collate evidence that copper homeostasis may function in the underlying etiology of several neurodegenerative diseases and offer novel insights into the potential prevention and treatment of these diseases based on copper homeostasis."

NfL and GFAP were significantly correlated with each other (0.37) but not with AÎ²42/40. The heritability of AÎ²42/40 (16%) is lower than the heritability of AD, suggesting strong environmental influences on this biomarker. The lack of correlation between NfL/GFAP and AÎ²42/40 indicates these markers may be on different biological pathways. Heritability is found for glial fibrillary acidic protein (60%), neurofilament light chain (42%), and amyloid beta (AÎ²) 42/40 (16%) plasma levels. AÎ²42/40 plasma levels are sensitive to person-specific environmental influences."

    "abstract": "Real-world data (RWD) are rapidly emerging sources of information for patients, clinicians and regulators. While randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reduce bias and confounding through the randomization process and provide the highest quality of evidence regarding drug efficacy, RCTs may be impractical or unfeasible for rare diseases or disease subsets. And yet, studies attempting to replicate clinical trial results using observational datasets have failed. Given the inherent differences between observational data and clinical trial results, this discordance is not surprising. However, RWD may still have independent value as complementary tools to trial results. In this viewpoint, we explore the challenges of RWD and discuss key questions that clinicians, patients, and regulators will need to consider when faced with positive efficacy data from clinical trials, and negative effectiveness data from real world studies. Finally, we explore novel trial designs that might help bridge the gap from RCTs to RWD."

    "abstract": "Clinical trials in cancer are ideally built on a foundation of sound mechanistic rationale and well-validated drug activity in relevant disease models. The screening of approved and investigational drugs in cell-based phenotypic assays can provide evidence of drug activity, but alternative screening paradigms are needed to develop and optimize multidrug combination regimens. Here, we utilize in vitro screening outcomes across a panel of lymphoma cell lines to dissect the activity of four small-molecule drugs (Venetoclax, Ibrutinib, Prednisolone, and Lenalidomide) currently under investigation within ongoing clinical trials in lymphoma. Data from multiple concentration ranges and time points show that synergistic drug combinations promote apoptosis and cytotoxicity responses at concentrations and time points that are consistent with in vivo drug exposures. To fully map the interaction landscape of these agents in relevant cell models, we developed an in vitro assay format that facilitated time-course evaluations involving concurrent multidrug exposure which further highlighted rapid, synergistic apoptosis induction as a central engine for the activity of this multicomponent targeted therapy. In addition to several instances of exceptional drug+drug synergy, the genetically similar diffuse large B cell lymphoma models also displayed substantial heterogeneity in the degree of synergism between drug pairs. A parallel survey of chemotherapies exhibited limited combination benefit, supporting recent findings that multicomponent chemotherapy outcomes are driven by individual drug activity. Collectively, these data demonstrate how in vitro drug screening data can identify multidrug combinations that exploit drug synergy to overcome the functional diversity of human malignancies."

    "abstract": "Following leaf cuticle penetration by specialized appressorial cells, the devastating blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae grows as invasive hyphae (IH) in living rice cells. IH are separated from host cytoplasm by plant-derived membranes forming an apoplastic compartment and a punctate biotrophic interfacial complex (BIC) that mediate the molecular host-pathogen interaction. What molecular and cellular processes determine the temperature range for this biotrophic growth stage is an unanswered question pertinent to a broader understanding of how phytopathogens may cope with environmental stresses arising under climate change. Here, we shed light on thermal adaptation in M. oryzae by disrupting the ACB1 gene encoding the single acyl-CoA-binding protein, an intracellular transporter of long-chain acyl-CoA esters. Loss of ACB1 affected fatty acid desaturation levels and abolished pathogenicity at optimal (26Â°C) and low (22Â°C) but not elevated (29Â°C) infection temperatures (the latter following post-penetration shifts from 26Â°C). Relative to wild type, the Îacb1 mutant strain exhibited poor vegetative growth and impaired membrane trafficking at 22Â°C and 26Â°C, but not at 29Â°C. In planta, Îacb1 biotrophic growth was inhibited at 26Â°C-which was accompanied by a multi-BIC phenotype-but not at 29Â°C, where BIC formation was normal. Underpinning the Îacb1 phenotype was impaired membrane fluidity at 22Â°C and 26Â°C but not at elevated temperatures, indicating Acb1 suppresses membrane rigidity at optimal- and suboptimal- but not supraoptimal temperatures. Deducing a temperature-dependent role for Acb1 in maintaining membrane fluidity homeostasis reveals how the thermal range for rice blast disease is both mechanistically determined and wider than hitherto appreciated."

Although substantial progress has been made in treating rare diseases, many patients have unmet medical sleep needs, and current regulatory policy makes it prohibitively difficult to address those needs medically. This opinion reviews the rare disease experience with sleep disorders and explores potential solutions. First, we provide case profiles for the rare diseases Wilson's Disease, Angelman Syndrome, and Prader-Willi Syndrome. These profiles highlight challenges in rare disease diagnosis and barriers to pinpointing disease pathophysiology, including biomarkers that intersect with sleep disorders. Second, we transition to a bird's eye view of sleep disorders and rare diseases by reporting input from a stakeholder discussion with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration regarding abnormal sleep patterns in various rare diseases. Last, in response to the profound unmet medical needs of patients with rare diseases and sleep disorders, we propose adapting and using the clinical trial design known as a \"basket trial\". In this case, a basket trial would include patients with different rare diseases but the same debilitating symptoms. This research approach has the potential to benefit many rare disease patients who are otherwise left with profound unmet medical needs."

This longitudinal retrospective study conducted using the French national claims (SystÃ¨me National des DonnÃ©es de SantÃ© [SNDS]) database assessed WD prevalence in France, described patients' characterizations and healthcare resource use and associated costs. Patients with WD were identified from SNDS using the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision code E83.0 for copper metabolism disorder or a long-term disease (affection de longue durÃ©e [ALD]) associated with this code between 2010 and 2019. Patients were categorized into hepatic, neurological, and psychiatric sub-cohorts. We identified 2287 patients with WD yielding a crude prevalence of 1 case per 33 898 individuals in 2019. The mean age at inclusion was 39.9 (standard deviation [SD] 22.8) years, 11 years more than that of the incident cohort (28.6, SD 20.3) identified via ALD, and 1180 (51.6%) patients were male. The crude mortality was 3.2% (in total 370 patients died). Overall, 1011 (44.2%), 754 (33.0%), and 414 (18.1%) patients experienced hepatic, neurological, and psychiatric manifestations, respectively. In total, 922 (40.3%) patients were reimbursed for WD-specific treatment, the most common being D-penicillamine (74.8%), and 201 (8.8%) underwent liver transplantation. The average annual hospitalization cost per patient was 4273.7â¬ (SD 11916.0). At least one sick leave was reported for 533 (23.3%) patients, with an annual average cost of 788.7â¬ (SD 1328.6). Our findings provide an updated understanding of the prevalence of WD, and indicate a considerable level of morbidity in this population, as well as a high level of direct/indirect costs associated with WD."

While primary islets, the gold standard for in vitro models, have a short culture life of approximately 1-2 weeks, we developed a novel protocol that employs reformed islets following dispersion coupled with a fine-tuned culture environment. Reformed islets exhibit physiological characteristics similar to primary islets, enabling high-resolution imaging and repeated functional assessment. Unlike other in vitro platforms, reformed islets retain an immune population, allowing the study of interactions between Î² cells and resident and infiltrating immune cells. Analyses showed that reformed islets have a similar composition and cytoarchitecture to primary islets, including macrophages and T cells, and can secrete insulin in response to glucose. Reformed islets exhibited partial dedifferentiation compared to native islets but were otherwise transcriptionally similar. The reformed islets offer a useful platform for studying diabetes pathology and can recapitulate both T1DM and T2DM disease milieus, providing an advantage over other models, such as mouse and human Î²-cell lines, which lack the input of non-Î²-endocrine cells and immune cell crosstalk."

BTNL8 encodes an intestinal epithelial regulator of VÎ³4+Î³Î´ T cells implicated in regulating gut homeostasis. Enrichment was exclusive to MIS-C, being absent in patients with COVID-19 or bacterial disease. Using an available functional test for BTNL8, rare variants from a larger cohort of MIS-C patients (n = 835) were tested which identified eight variants in 18 patients (2.2%) with impaired engagement of VÎ³4+Î³Î´ T cells. Most of these variants were in the B30.2 domain of BTNL8 implicated in sensing epithelial cell status. These findings were associated with altered intestinal permeability, suggesting a possible link between disrupted gut homeostasis and MIS-C-associated enteropathy triggered by SARS-CoV-2."

    "abstract": "Prognosis is a forecast of the likely course of a disease and its future implications on treatment outcomes. The significance of periodontal prognosis in clinical practice is evident by its influence on treatment planning, communication, and in the retrospective evaluation of treatment results. While there are multiple well-known prognosis systems reported in the periodontal dental literature, there is an absence of data on the actual use of prognosis assignment among practicing clinicians. The purpose of this study was to survey military periodontists regarding their utilization of periodontal prognosis and associated systems and to evaluate prognosis' influence on treatment planning as well as its implications on operational dental readiness. A 19-question internet survey was disseminated to military periodontists in the U.S. Air Force, Army, and Navy via their respective Periodontal Consultants to the Surgeon Generals. The survey inquired on provider-specific demographic information, the provider's favored periodontal prognosis system, when and how prognosis is applied, and on the relationship between prognosis and operational dental readiness. Fifty-five percent (n = 65 out of 120) of eligible survey participants completed the survey. Army (94.4%, n = 17) and Air Force (72.2%, n = 13) respondents preferred utilizing the Kwok and Caton periodontal prognosis system compared to 37.9% (n = 11) of Navy periodontists. Most respondents assigned prognosis at multiple time points in a patient's overall course of treatment (68%, n = 44), identified the severity of the periodontal presentation and the predictability of treatment outcomes as the most important factors involved in assigning a prognosis (82%, n = 55), and indicated that periodontal prognosis did not influence their dental readiness classification and vice versa. Kwok and Caton and McGuire periodontal prognosis systems were utilized by the majority of respondents but differed in utilization by military service branch. Respondents considered periodontal presentation severity and treatment outcome predictability the most important factors when assigning a prognosis. There was minimal influence between operational dental readiness and periodontal prognosis. Future research will evaluate prognosis system utilization in a broader population and will assess the impact of system standardization in education and clinical practice."

    "abstract": "Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a frequently fatal disease of the central nervous system caused by JC virus (JCV). Survival is dependent on early diagnosis and ability to re-establish anti-viral T cell immunity. Adoptive transfer of polyomavirus-specific T cells has shown promise; however, there are no readily available HLA-matched anti-viral T cells to facilitate rapid treatment. Identify epitopes of the JCV major capsid protein VP1 that elicit an immune response in the context of human leukocyte antigen allele A*02:01 (HLA-A2) and isolate cognate T cell receptors (TCRs) from healthy donors. Evaluate individual VP1-specific TCRs for their capacity to be expressed in T cells and clear JCV <i>in vitro</i>. PBMCs from HLA-A2+ healthy donors were stimulated with peptide libraries tiled across the JCV VP1 protein. Multiple rounds of stimulation were performed to identify the antigens that induced the largest expansion and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell response (measured as INFÎ³, TNFÎ±, CD137, and CD69 expression). High-affinity, antigen-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were isolated based on intensity of tetramer binding for downstream single-cell TCR sequencing. Candidate TCRs were selected based on tetramer binding affinity and activation assays. Promising TCRs were introduced into the T cell genome via viral transduction for <i>in vitro</i> validation including peptide-pulsed K562 cells and astrocyte cells, and JCV-infected astrocytes. Four conserved JCV VP1 epitopes (amino acids 100-108, 251-259, 253-262, and 274-283) presented by HLA-A2 were identified. VP1(100-108) consistently elicited the highest level of IFN-Î³ production from multiple donors and this peptide is in a highly conserved region of VP1. We next identified fourteen high avidity TCRs specific for VP1(100-108). When virally transduced into primary human T cells, seven of these TCRs demonstrated specific binding to VP1(100-108):HLA-A2 tetramers, and four showed increased IFN-Î³ response when incubated with peptide. Primary CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells expressing two of these TCRs cleared both HLA-A2 positive K562 cells and HLA-A2 positive SVG astrocyte cell line presenting exogenously added VP1 peptide at a range of E:T ratios. In addition, both TCR-transduced T cell populations effectively lysed JCV-infected astrocytes. We identified JCV VP1 epitopes that are immunogenic in the context of HLA-A2 MHC-I, including epitopes that have not been previously described. The VP1(100-108) epitope was used to isolate HLA-A2-restricted TCRs. When cloned into primary human CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, these TCRs recognized VP1 (100-108)-presenting targets, and the transduced T cells conferred cytotoxic activity and eliminated K562 and astrocyte cells displaying the VP1(100-108) peptide and not sham peptide, as well as JCV-infected astrocytes. Taken together, these data suggest that JCV VP1-specific TCRs could be appealing therapeutics for HLA-A2+ individuals with PML in whom intrinsic T cell immunity cannot be rescued."

The sibling matched analysis included 13 312 infants exposed to a covid-19 vaccine in the first trimester and 15 089 matched older siblings with the same mother, with an expected birth date after 16 October 2016 and no reported in utero exposure to a covid-19 vaccine. Major congenital anomalies, overall and grouped by specific organ systems, diagnosed within 28 days of birth. Major congenital anomalies were present in 832 (24.3 per 1000 live births) infants exposed to an mRNA covid-19 vaccine in the first trimester compared with 927 (26.5 per 1000 live births) infants not exposed to a vaccine, resulting in an adjusted prevalence ratio of 0.89 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.79 to 1.01).

    "abstract": "Ixodes scapularis and Ixodes pacificus are vectors of a range of pathogens of public health significance in North America. These ticks transmit pathogens to and from wild animal reservoir host species, but also bite humans and expose them to the pathogens. We describe the geographical and temporal distribution of the pathogen Babesia odocoilei, the causative agent of cervid babesiosis. Ixodes spp. ticks collected through active and passive surveillance were submitted to the National Microbiology Laboratory of the Public Health Agency of Canada for analysis of the presence of B. odocoilei from 2018 to 2021. Generalized linear models were constructed to evaluate the temporal change of B. odocoilei prevalence across Canada. Babesia odocoilei-positive I. scapularis are widespread across south-central and eastern regions of Canada, with an overall prevalence of 12.0 % in both nymphs (CI 95 % : 11.4-12.6) and adults (CI 95 % : 11.9-12.1) collected in passive surveillance and 13.2 % (CI 95 % : 12.9-13.5) and 10.0 % (CI 95 % : 9.8-10.2) in nymphs and adult, respectively, collected in active surveillance. A single I. pacificus tick tested positive in active surveillance out of 29 ticks collected in British Columbia, while no B odocoilei-positive I. scapularis were found in passive surveillance among the 11 adult ticks tested. Although B. odocoilei infection prevalence of adult I. scapularis was significantly higher in 2019 (14.1 %) than in 2018 (7.4 %), it remained stable from 2019 to 2021, suggesting that this pathogen may already be well established in endemic tick populations. The results provided in this article represent, to date, the most comprehensive picture of B. odocoilei distribution and prevalence in ticks in Canada and highlight the interest of maintaining One Health surveillance approaches to give added insight into disease transmission cycles for less well-characterized microorganisms."

Understanding the associations of dietary quality during pregnancy with infant growth may inform obesity prevention strategies. To evaluate the associations of prenatal dietary quality according to the Healthy Eating Index (HEI) and the Empirical Dietary Inflammatory Pattern (EDIP) with infant size at birth and infant growth from birth to age 24 months.

Data were analyzed from March 2021 to August 2024. The HEI and the EDIP dietary patterns. Outcomes of interest were infant birth weight, categorized as SGA, reference range, or LGA, and infant growth from birth to ages 6, 12, and 24 months, categorized as slow growth (weight-for-length z score [WLZ] score difference <-0.67), within reference range (WLZ score difference -0.67 to 0.67), or rapid (WLZ score difference, >0.67). The study included 2854 birthing parent-child dyads (median [IQR] maternal age, 30 [25-34] years; 1464 [51.3%] male infants).

A high HEI score (>80), indicative of a healthier diet, was associated with lower odds of LGA (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.88 [95% CI, 0.79-0.98]), rapid growth from birth to age 6 months (aOR, 0.80 [95% CI, 0.37-0.94]) and age 24 months (aOR 0.82 [95% CI, 0.70- 0.96]), and slow growth from birth to age 6 months (aOR, 0.65 [95% CI, 0.50-0.84]), 12 months (aOR, 0.74 [95% CI, 0.65-0.83]), and 24 months (OR, 0.65 [95% CI, 0.56-0.76]) compared with an HEI score 80 or lower. There was no association between high HEI and SGA (aOR, 1.14 [95% CI, 0.95-1.35]). A low EDIP score (ie, â¤63.6), indicative of a less inflammatory diet, was associated with higher odds of LGA (aOR, 1.24 [95% CI, 1.13-1.36]) and rapid infant growth from birth to age 12 months (aOR, 1.50 [95% CI, 1.18-1.91]) and lower odds of rapid growth to age 6 months (aOR, 0.77 [95% CI, 0.71-0.83]), but there was no association with SGA (aOR, 0.80 [95% CI, 0.51-1.25]) compared with an EDIP score of 63.6 or greater. In this cohort study, a prenatal diet that aligned with the US Dietary Guidelines was associated with reduced patterns of rapid and slow infant growth, known risk factors associated with obesity.

We aimed to examine service outcomes such as diagnostic yield (definite final diagnosis), referral rate, and sources of referral, and explore variation in outcomes of pES by individual or service level factors between 01 October 2021 and 30 June 2022. pES testing results from the National Health Service laboratories performing testing were linked to National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service data and the Maternity Services Data Set and descriptive statistics computed. There were 475,089 women who gave birth in England during the study period. The referral rate for pES was 8.6 (95% CI 7.8, 9.4) per 10,000 maternities. About 59% of those referred proceeded with pES testing and 35% of women who proceeded received a definite final diagnosis with a median turnaround time of 15 days. Of those who had pES testing, 64.6% had a live birth, 25.3% underwent termination of pregnancy (median gestational age at termination: 26 weeks), and 9.3% had a stillbirth. Among the 85 women who had a definite final diagnosis, 40% had a termination of pregnancy, 18% had a stillbirth, and 42% had a live birth. The corresponding figures among women without a definite final diagnosis were 18%, 5%, and 78%, respectively. Among women who had a termination of pregnancy, the median gestational age at final report was 24.9 weeks and 26.2 weeks at termination. Variation observed in some of the characteristics and outcomes between regional services were limited by small sample size. This study showed that of those referred, pES testing provided a diagnosis for one in three pregnancies with a fetal anomaly across England during the study period when other tests had been non-informative. Women who opted for a termination of pregnancy underwent the procedure at relatively late gestations. Earlier referral for pES, streamlining pathways, and faster turnaround times may help results to be available at an earlier gestation to allow families more time to make decisions around continuing or terminating their pregnancy. The variation in service outcomes between regional services needs to be investigated further to understand the reasons for these differences."

In a multicenter, noninferiority trial, we randomly assigned hospitalized patients (including patients in the intensive care unit [ICU]) who had bloodstream infection to receive antibiotic treatment for 7 days or 14 days. Antibiotic selection, dosing, and route were at the discretion of the treating team. We excluded patients with severe immunosuppression, foci requiring prolonged treatment, single cultures with possible contaminants, or cultures yielding <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>. The primary outcome was death from any cause by 90 days after diagnosis of the bloodstream infection, with a noninferiority margin of 4 percentage points. Across 74 hospitals in seven countries, 3608 patients underwent randomization and were included in the intention-to-treat analysis; 1814 patients were assigned to 7 days of antibiotic treatment, and 1794 to 14 days. At enrollment, 55.0% of patients were in the ICU and 45.0% were on hospital wards. Infections were acquired in the community (75.4%), hospital wards (13.4%) and ICUs (11.2%). Bacteremia most commonly originated from the urinary tract (42.2%), abdomen (18.8%), lung (13.0%), vascular catheters (6.3%), and skin or soft tissue (5.2%). By 90 days, 261 patients (14.5%) receiving antibiotics for 7 days had died and 286 patients (16.1%) receiving antibiotics for 14 days had died (difference, -1.6 percentage points [95.7% confidence interval {CI}, -4.0 to 0.8]), which showed the noninferiority of the shorter treatment duration. Patients were treated for longer than the assigned duration in 23.1% of the patients in the 7-day group and in 10.7% of the patients in the 14-day group. A per-protocol analysis also showed noninferiority (difference, -2.0 percentage points [95% CI, -4.5 to 0.6]). These findings were generally consistent across secondary clinical outcomes and across prespecified subgroups defined according to patient, pathogen, and syndrome characteristics. Among hospitalized patients with bloodstream infection, antibiotic treatment for 7 days was noninferior to treatment for 14 days.

    "title": "Long-term hypoxia modulates depolarization activation of BK<sub>Ca</sub> currents in fetal sheep middle cerebral arterial myocytes.",
    "abstract": "Previous evidence indicates that gestational hypoxia disrupts cerebrovascular development, increasing the risk of intracranial hemorrhage and stroke in the newborn. Due to the role of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> in regulating vascular smooth muscle (VSM) tone and fetal cerebrovascular blood flow, understanding Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals can offer insight into the pathophysiological disruptions taking place in hypoxia-related perinatal cerebrovascular disease. This study aimed to determine the extent to which gestational hypoxia disrupts local Ca<sup>2+</sup> sparks and whole-cell Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals and coupling with BK<sub>Ca</sub> channel activity. Confocal imaging of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> and recording BK<sub>Ca</sub> currents of fetal sheep middle cerebral arterial (MCA) myocytes was performed. MCAs were isolated from term fetal sheep (â¼140 days of gestation) from ewes held at low- (700 m) and high-altitude (3,801 m) hypoxia (LTH) for 100+ days of gestation. Arteries were depolarized with 30 mM KCl (30K), in the presence or absence of 10 Î¼M ryanodine (Ry), to block RyR mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> release. Membrane depolarization increased Ry-sensitive Ca<sup>2+</sup> spark frequency in normoxic and LTH groups along with BK<sub>Ca</sub> activity. LTH reduced Ca<sup>2+</sup> spark and whole-cell Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity and induced a large leftward shift in the voltage-dependence of BK<sub>Ca</sub> current activation. The influence of LTH on the spatial and temporal aspects of Ca<sup>2+</sup> sparks and whole-cell Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses varied. Overall, LTH attenuates Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling while increasing the coupling of Ca<sup>2+</sup> sparks to BK<sub>Ca</sub> activity; a process that potentially helps maintain oxygen delivery to the developing brain."

    "abstract": "People hospitalised for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have elevated incidence of diabetes. However, it is unclear whether this is due to shared risk factors, confounding or stress hyperglycaemia in response to acute illness. We analysed a multicentre prospective cohort study (PHOSP-COVID) of people â¥18 years discharged from NHS hospitals across the United Kingdom following COVID-19. Individuals were included if they attended at least one research visit with a HbA1c measurement within 14 months of discharge and had no history of diabetes at baseline. The primary outcome was new onset diabetes (any type), as defined by a first glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) measurement â¥6.5% (â¥48 mmol/mol). Follow-up was censored at the last HbA1c measurement. Age-standardised incidence rates and incidence rate ratios (adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, length of hospital stay, body mass index, smoking, physical activity, deprivation, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia/hypercholesterolaemia, intensive therapy unit admission, invasive mechanical ventilation, corticosteroid use and C-reactive protein score) were calculated using Poisson regression. Incidence rates were compared with the control groups of published clinical trials in the United Kingdom by applying the same inclusion and exclusion criteria, where possible. Incidence of diabetes was 91.4 per 1000 person-years and was higher in South Asian (incidence rate ratios [IRR] = 3.60; 1.77, 7.32; p < 0.001) and Black ethnic groups (IRR = 2.36; 1.07, 5.21; p = 0.03) compared with White ethnic groups. When restricted to similar characteristics, the incidence rates were similar to those in UK clinical trials data. Diabetes incidence following hospitalisation for COVID-19 is high, but it remains uncertain whether it is disproportionately higher than pre-pandemic levels."

    "abstract": "Prevention of severe COVID-19 disease by SARS-CoV-2 in high-risk patients, such as immuno-compromised individuals, can be achieved by administration of antibody prophylaxis, but producing antibodies can be costly. Plant expression platforms allow substantial lower production costs compared to traditional bio-manufacturing platforms depending on mammalian cells in bioreactors. In this study, we describe the expression, production and purification of the originally human COVA2-15 antibody in plants. Our plant-produced mAbs demonstrated comparable neutralizing activity with COVA2-15 produced in mammalian cells. Furthermore, they exhibited similar capacity to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection in a hamster model. To further enhance these biosimilars, we performed three glyco- and protein engineering techniques. First, to increase antibody half-life, we introduced YTE-mutation in the Fc tail; second, optimization of N-linked glycosylation by the addition of a C-terminal ER-retention motif (HDEL), and finally; production of mAb in plant production lines lacking Î²-1,2-xylosyltransferase and Î±-1,3-fucosyltransferase activities (FX-KO). These engineered biosimilars exhibited optimized glycosylation, enhanced phagocytosis and NK cell activation capacity compared to conventional plant-produced S15 and M15 biosimilars, in some cases outperforming mammalian cell produced COVA2-15. These engineered antibodies hold great potential for enhancing in vivo efficacy of mAb treatment against COVID-19 and provide a platform for the development of antibodies against other emerging viruses in a cost-effective manner."

    "abstract": "Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is the leading cause of end stage kidney failure worldwide, of which cellular insulin resistance is a major driver. Here, we study key human kidney cell types implicated in DKD (podocytes, glomerular endothelial, mesangial and proximal tubular cells) in insulin sensitive and resistant conditions, and perform simultaneous transcriptomics and proteomics for integrated analysis. Our data is further compared with bulk- and single-cell transcriptomic kidney biopsy data from early- and advanced-stage DKD patient cohorts. We identify several consistent changes (individual genes, proteins, and molecular pathways) occurring across all insulin-resistant kidney cell types, together with cell-line-specific changes occurring in response to insulin resistance, which are replicated in DKD biopsies. This study provides a rich data resource to direct future studies in elucidating underlying kidney signalling pathways and potential therapeutic targets in DKD."

    "abstract": "Johne's disease, caused by Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP), is a chronic enteritis that adversely affects welfare and productivity in cattle. Screening and subsequent removal of affected animals is a common approach for disease management, but efforts are hindered by low diagnostic sensitivity. Expression levels of small non-coding RNA molecules involved in gene regulation (microRNAs), which may be altered during mycobacterial infection, may present an alternative diagnostic method. The expression levels of 24 microRNAs affected by mycobacterial infection were measured in sera from MAP-positive (n = 66) and MAP-negative cattle (n = 65). They were then used within a machine learning approach to build an optimal classifier for MAP diagnosis. The method provided 72% accuracy, 73% sensitivity and 71% specificity on average, with an area under the curve of 78%. Although control samples were collected from farms nominally MAP-free, the low sensitivity of current diagnostics means some animals may have been misclassified. MicroRNA profiling combined with advanced predictive modelling enables rapid and accurate diagnosis of Johne's disease in cattle."

    "abstract": "Wilson disease (WD) primarily presents with hepatic and neurological symptoms. While hepatic symptoms typically precede the neurological manifestations, copper accumulates in the brain already in this patient group and leads to subclinical brain MRI abnormalities including T2 hyperintensities and atrophy. This study aimed to assess brain morphological changes in mild hepatic WD. WD patients without a history of neurologic symptoms and decompensated cirrhosis and control participants underwent brain MRI at 3T scanner including high-resolution T1-weighted images. A volumetric evaluation was conducted on the following brain regions: nucleus accumbens, caudate, pallidum, putamen, thalamus, amygdala, hippocampus, midbrain, pons, cerebellar gray matter, white matter (WM), and superior peduncle, using Freesurfer v7 software. Whole-brain analyses using voxel- and surface-based morphometry were performed using SPM12. Statistical comparisons utilized a general linear model adjusted for total intracranial volume, age, and sex. Twenty-six WD patients with mild hepatic form (30 Â± 9 years [mean age Â± SD]); 11 women; mean treatment duration 13 Â± 12 (range 0-42) years and 28 healthy controls (33 Â± 9 years; 15 women) were evaluated. Volumetric analysis revealed a significantly smaller pons volume and a trend for smaller midbrain and cerebellar WM in WD patients compared to controls. Whole-brain analysis revealed regions of reduced volume in the pons, cerebellar, and lobar WM in the WD group. No significant differences in gray matter density or cortical thickness were found. Myelin or WM in general seems vulnerable to low-level copper toxicity, with WM volume loss showing promise as a marker for assessing brain involvement in early WD stages."

    "abstract": "By improving disease risk prediction, polygenic risk scores (PRSs) could have a significant impact on health promotion and disease prevention. Due to the historical oversampling of populations with European ancestry for genome-wide association studies, PRSs perform less well in other, understudied populations, leading to concerns that clinical use in their current forms could widen health care disparities. The PRIMED Consortium was established to develop methods to improve the performance of PRSs in global populations and individuals of diverse genetic ancestry. To this end, PRIMED is aggregating and harmonizing multiple phenotype and genotype datasets on AnVIL, an interoperable secure cloud-based platform, to perform individual- and summary-level analyses using population and statistical genetics approaches. Study sites, the coordinating center, and representatives from the NIH work alongside other NHGRI and global consortia to achieve these goals. PRIMED is also evaluating ethical and social implications of PRS implementation and investigating the joint modeling of social determinants of health and PRS in computing disease risk. The phenotypes of interest are primarily cardiometabolic diseases and cancer, the leading causes of death and disability worldwide. Early deliverables of the consortium include methods for data sharing on AnVIL, development of a common data model to harmonize phenotype and genotype data from cohort studies as well as electronic health records, adaptation of recent guidelines for population descriptors to global cohorts, and sharing of PRS methods/tools. As a multisite collaboration, PRIMED aims to foster equity in the development and use of polygenic risk assessment."

    "abstract": "Immune effector cell-associated hematotoxicity (ICAHT) is a major B-cell targeted chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell related toxicity. Although ICAHT incidence and severity is documented in large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), and multiple myeloma (MM), ICAHT has not been described in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). Similarly, the CAR-HEMATOTOX (CAR-HT) model, designed to predict severe prolonged neutropenia (â¥14 days of absolute neutrophil count [ANC] <500/Î¼L), has been validated in LBCL, MCL, and MM, but not in B-ALL. As B-ALL bone marrow (BM) infiltration can impact cytopenias, we sought to describe ICAHT and assess CAR-HT for predicting hematotoxicity in B-ALL. In a cohort of 156 children and young adults with relapsed/refractory B-ALL, the median duration of severe neutropenia (ANC <500/Î¼L) was 13 days (95% confidence interval, 10-16 days), with 83 (53%) experiencing grade â¥3 ICAHT. Applying CAR-HT, nearly 90% were classified as high risk, demonstrating limited discriminative power and prompting further development. Using the association identified between BM disease burden and postinfusion neutropenia (r = 0.64, P < .0001), we developed the ALL-Hematotox (ALL-HT) score, which substitutes BM disease burden for ferritin in CAR-HT. The ALL-HT score associated with severe prolonged neutropenia (area under the curve = 0.84, P < .0001), and appropriately discriminated high-risk patients (47%) who had more cumulative days of neutropenia (26 vs 4 days; P < .0001), fewer rates of complete response (88% vs 98%; P = .03), and shorter median overall survival (9.8 vs 24 months; log-rank P = .0002). ALL-HT was also validated in 2 independent cohorts. The ALL-HT score refines a widely accepted predictive model of postinfusion hematotoxicity, which is applicable in B-ALL."

    "abstract": "Patterns of signal from tau positron emission tomography (tau-PET) confined to the medial temporal lobe (MTL) or extended into the neocortex may be relevant for Alzheimer's disease (AD) research if they are linked to differential biomarker levels and cognitive decline. Visual assessment of Tau-PET [F-18]florquinitau (FQT) exams from 728 initially non-demented older adults yielded four uptake groups: tau-negative (T-), MTL-only (T+<sub>MTL</sub>), neocortex-only (T+<sub>Neo</sub>), or both (T+<sub>MTL&Neo</sub>). Mixed effects models assessed group differences in retrospective cognitive and plasma pTau217 trajectories. T+<sub>MTL&Neo</sub> was the most common T+ group (n = 97; 93% A+) and exhibited the sharpest worsening in cognitive and pTau217 trajectories before tau PET. The T+<sub>MTL&Neo</sub> category represents an intermediate to advanced stage of AD preceded by rising ptau217 and progressive cognitive decline. The pTau217 finding suggests that A+, T+ in MTL or neocortex could represent early AD stages, with a higher likelihood of progressing to more advanced stages. Visual assessments of Tau-PET FQT revealed four distinct uptake groups: tau-negative (T-), MTL-only (T+<sub>MTL</sub>), neocortex-only (T+<sub>Neo</sub>), or both (T+<sub>MTL&Neo</sub>). Amyloid positive participants in the T+<sub>MTL</sub> and T+<sub>MTL&Neo</sub> categories showed a retrospectively faster decline in their cognitive trajectories, and a sharper increase in pTau217 levels in plasma, compared to T-. The T+<sub>MTL&Neo</sub> group displayed sharper trajectories compared with the other Tau positive groups in both their cognitive scores and pTau217 plasma levels. Our results suggest that participants with Tau present in both MTL and neocortex represent an intermediate to advanced stage of AD, whereas participants with signals confined to either MTL or neocortex could represent earlier AD stages."

Challenges associated with measuring long-term clinical protection warrant the evaluation of immune response kinetics after vaccination. Data from a large phase 2 randomized double-blind clinical trial (PREVAC) were used to evaluate waning of anti-Ebola virus (EBOV) glycoprotein (GP<sub>1,2</sub>) antibody concentrations after rVSVÎG-ZEBOV-GP or Ad26.ZEBOV, MVA-BN-Filo vaccination with linear mixed-effect regression models. After a post-vaccination peak, each vaccination strategy was associated with a decrease of anti-EBOV GP<sub>1,2</sub> antibody concentrations with distinct kinetics, highlighting a less-rapid decline in antibody levels after vaccination by rVSVÎG-ZEBOV-GP. One year after administration of the vaccine, antibody concentrations were higher in children compared to adults for both vaccines, although with different effect sizes: 1.74-fold higher concentrations (95% confidence interval [CI] [1.48; 2.02]) for children 12-17 years old to 3.10-fold higher concentrations (95% CI [2.58; 3.69]) for those 1-4 years old compared to adults for Ad26.ZEBOV, MVA-BN-Filo versus 1.36-fold (95% CI [1.12; 1.61]) to 1.41-fold (95% CI [1.21; 1.62]) higher than these values for adults, with relatively small changes from one age category of children to another, for rVSVÎG-ZEBOV-GP. Antibody concentrations also differed according to geographical location, pre-vaccination antibody concentration, and sex.

    "title": "Genetically Confirmed Wilson Disease: A Retrospective Cohort Study From Bahrain.",
    "abstract": "Introduction Wilson disease (WD) is a rare inherited autosomal recessive disorder caused by a mutation in the <i>ATP7B</i> gene. This mutation affects copper metabolism, leading to the accumulation of copper in the liver, brain, cornea, and other tissues. If not treated, WD can lead to significant morbidities. This study aimed to display the prevalence, clinical presentations, diagnosis, treatment, and outcome of WD in Bahrain. Methods This is a retrospective cohort study of patients diagnosed with WD in the Department of Pediatrics, Salmaniya Medical Complex, Manama, Kingdom of Bahrain, from March 2002 to July 2024. The diagnosis of WD was based on clinical presentations, laboratory markers, radiological imaging, and genetic testing. Results Up to July 2024, eight patients from four families were diagnosed with WD in Bahrain. Accordingly, the prevalence of WD was 1.7 patients per 100,000 (0.002%). Parental consanguinity was noted in all families. Males were equal to females (n=4, 50% each). The mean age at presentation was 13 Â± 3.6 years, ranging from 9 to 21 years. Three patients (37.5%) presented with hepatic manifestations, two (25%) with neurological manifestations, and three (37.5%) were detected upon family screening. Kayser Fleischer (KF) rings were found in two (25%) patients via slit lamp examination. Of the seven patients with available data, five (71.4%) had low serum copper, six (85.7%) had low serum ceruloplasmin, and six (85.7%) had high 24-hour urinary copper. Genetic testing was positive for the <i>ATP7B</i> gene variants in all patients, of which four members of one family had a novel mutation. Abdominal ultrasound revealed hepatic cirrhosis in four (50%) patients, increased hepatic echogenicity in five (62.5%), splenomegaly in three (37.5%) patients, and ascites in one (12.5%) patient. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was positive in three (50%) out of six patients. All patients received copper chelating therapy. Six (75%) patients survived; one of them underwent living-related liver transplantation due to rapidly progressive neurological symptoms. Two (25%) patients died due to hepatic failure and encephalopathy. Conclusion WD is a rare disorder in Bahrain. This study presents eight patients with WD from four families. Five patients were symptomatic at presentation, while three were diagnosed upon genetic family screening. Hepatic manifestations were the most common presentation, followed by behavioral changes and neurological symptoms. Two patients had KF rings, while three had classical brain MRI findings. Genetic testing served as a confirmatory diagnostic tool that revealed a diversity of variants causing the disease, of which one variant was a novel mutation. Despite oral chelating therapy, morbidity and mortality remain high in patients with WD."

    "title": "Convergent effects of synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone and amyloid beta in human olfactory neurosphere-derived cells.",
    "abstract": "Stressful life events and glucocorticoid (stress) hormones appear to increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease and hasten its progression, but the reasons for this remain unclear. One potential explanation is that when amyloid Î² (AÎ²) pathology is accumulating in the preclinical disease stage, glucocorticoid receptor signalling during stressful events exacerbates cellular dysfunction caused by AÎ². Alternatively, AÎ² may disrupt glucocorticoid receptor signalling. To explore these possibilities, we investigated whether the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone and AÎ² have overlapping effects on the cellular proteome and whether AÎ² influences canonical glucocorticoid receptor function. Human olfactory neurosphere-derived (ONS) cells, collected from the olfactory mucosa of six adult donors, were treated with soluble AÎ²40 or AÎ²42 followed by dexamethasone. Proteins were quantified by mass spectrometry. After 32 h treatment, AÎ²40 and AÎ²42 both induced profound changes in innate immunity-related proteins. After 72 h, AÎ²42 formed widespread aggregates and induced few proteomic changes, whereas AÎ²40 remained soluble and altered expression of mitochondrial and innate immunity-related proteins. ONS cells revealed overlapping impacts of AÎ²40 and dexamethasone, with 23 proteins altered by both treatments. For 16 proteins (including eight mitochondrial proteins) dexamethasone counteracted the effects of AÎ²40. For example, caspase 4 and methylmalonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase were increased by AÎ²40 and decreased by dexamethasone. Consistent with this finding, AÎ²40 increased, but dexamethasone decreased, ONS cell proliferation. For seven proteins, including superoxide dismutase [Mn] mitochondrial, dexamethasone exacerbated the effects of AÎ²40. For some proteins, including complement C3, the effects of dexamethasone differed depending on whether AÎ²40 was present or absent. Neither AÎ² species influenced glucocorticoid receptor nuclear translocation. Overall, this study revealed that glucocorticoid receptor signalling modifies the intracellular effects of AÃ40, counteracting some effects and exacerbating others. It suggests that cellular mechanisms through which glucocorticoid receptor signalling influences Alzheimer's disease risk/progression are complex and determined by the balance of beneficial and detrimental glucocorticoid effects."

    "abstract": "Anaplasma bovis is primarily an infectious agent of ruminants, and has most commonly been reported in Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. Although the primary cause of human anaplasmosis is Anaplasma phagocytophilum, humans may rarely be infected by other Anaplasma spp. Human disease attributed to A. bovis has been occasionally reported, including an A. bovis-like agent in the United States. DNA of an A. bovis-like agent has been amplified from humans and the tick Dermacentor variabilis in the central region of the U.S., but larger prevalence studies among potential vectors or reservoir hosts in the U.S. have not been reported. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of A. bovis-like agent among D. variabilis and cattle in the Southcentral U.S. Previously extracted DNA from adult D. variabilis collected from Oklahoma (n = 38) and Kansas (n = 93), and blood of cattle from Oklahoma (n = 140) were tested by conventional PCR. Overall prevalence of A. bovis-like DNA within ticks was determined to be 3.1% (4/131), and all positive ticks originated from Oklahoma. Overall prevalence in bovine blood was determined to be 0% (0/140). These findings confirm the presence of an A. bovis-like agent, a potentially zoonotic pathogen, among ticks in the Southcentral U.S.; this agent is likely underrecognized and has been detected in parts of the U.S. that lie outside of the established geographic range for A. phagocytophilum. Further investigation and surveillance are necessary to elucidate possible reservoirs of A. bovis in the U.S., further evaluate the burden of human infection, and fully characterize genetic differences between the A. bovis-like agent detected in the U.S. and A. bovis in other regions of the world."

The frequency, sensitivity, and specificity of acute respiratory disease symptoms among hospitalized and community cohorts of adults with RSV were analyzed. RSV-LRTD signs/symptoms assessed included shortness of breath (dyspnea), cough and/or fever, wheezing/rales/rhonchi (abnormal lung sounds by auscultation), sputum production, tachypnea, hypoxemia, and pleuritic chest pain. Dyspnea and tachypnea provided the best differentiation between hospitalized and community RSV-positive cases. The severe RSV-LRTD case definition yielding one of the highest and best-balanced sensitivity and specificity was dyspnea paired with either abnormal lung sounds by auscultation, hypoxemia, tachypnea, cough and/or fever, sputum, or chest pain. Dyspnea alone, and in combination with certain other lower respiratory tract disease signs/symptoms, was a leading symptomatic indicator for severe RSV outcomes. These results contribute to the harmonization of case definitions for RSV disease."

    "abstract": "Larval source management (LSM) is re-emerging as a critical malaria intervention to address challenges associated with core vector control tools, such as insecticide-treated nets (ITNs), and to accelerate progress towards elimination. Presently, LSM is not widely used in rural settings and is instead more commonly applied in urban and arid settings. A systematic entomological assessment was conducted in rural communities of southeastern Tanzania, where insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) are widely used, to explore opportunities for deploying LSM to improve malaria control. Aquatic habitat surveys were conducted in 2022 and 2023 to understand habitat usage by different mosquito vectors, covering five villages during the rainy season and seven villages during the dry season. Additionally, samples of adult mosquitoes were collected to assess the role of various Anopheles species in malaria transmission in the area, and to explore opportunities for species sanitation using targeted LSM. Adult mosquito surveys showed that in this area, the total entomological inoculation rates (EIR) for indoor collections were 20.1 and 6.5 infectious bites per person per year for outdoors. Anopheles funestus and Anopheles arabiensis were the only Anopheles vectors identified. Anopheles funestus was responsible for over 97.6% of the malaria transmission indoors and 95.4% outdoors. The concurrent larval surveys found that habitats with late instar An. arabiensis and An. funestus comprised only a small subset of 11.2%-16.5% of all water bodies in the rainy season, and 9.7%-15.2% in the dry season. In terms of size, these habitats covered 66.4%-68.2% of the total habitat areas in the wet season, reducing to 33.9%-40.6% in the dry season. From the rainy season to the dry season, the surface area of habitats occupied by An. arabiensis and An. funestus decreased by 92.0% to 97.5%, while the number of habitats occupied by An. arabiensis and An. funestus decreased by 38.0% to 57.3%. Anopheles funestus preferred large, permanent habitats with clear water and vegetation year-round, while An. arabiensis showed contrasting seasonal preferences, favouring sunlit still waters in the rainy season and larger, opaque habitats in the dry season. These findings suggest that An. funestus, which is the dominant malaria vector in the area, mediating over 95% of malaria transmission, preferentially occupies only a small subset of uniquely identifiable aquatic habitats in both wet and dry seasons. This presents an opportunity to expand LSM in rural settings by carefully targeting An. funestus habitats, which might be effective and logistically feasible as a complementary approach alongside existing interventions. Further research should assess the impact of targeted LSM for species sanitation compared to blanket LSM."

    "title": "Projected Cost Savings With Optimal Medication Adherence in Patients With Cardiovascular Disease Requiring Lipid-Lowering Therapy: A Multinational Economic Evaluation Study.",
    "abstract": "Poor adherence to chronic cardiovascular treatments can impede targeted clinical outcomes. This study estimates the potential benefits of improving adherence among patients with cardiovascular disease requiring secondary prevention in Mexico, Thailand, and China. We performed Markov model simulation for patients with cardiovascular disease in 3 countries from health care and societal perspectives over a lifetime horizon. Two scenarios were compared: (1) optimal adherence based on a meta-analysis of 51 randomized controlled trials and (2) status quo. The association between adherence and cardiovascular disease outcomes derives from a dose-response meta-analysis of 4 051 338 patients. Outcomes include the accumulated number of cardiovascular events and associated costs in 2022 US dollars, life years, and quality-adjusted life years. Optimal adherence could prevent 42 (95% credible interval [CrI], 29-56) cardiovascular events in Mexico, 34 (95% CrI, 24-50) in Thailand, and 63 (95% CrI, 43-89) in China per 1000 patients over a lifetime. Incremental effectiveness per patient was 0.60 (95% CrI, 0.47-0.74) life-years in Mexico, 0.68 (95% CrI, 0.37-0.94) quality-adjusted life years in Thailand, and 0.93 (95% CrI, 0.44-1.27) quality-adjusted life years in China. Cost savings from societal perspective amounted to $412 (95% CrI, $211-$723), $316 (95% CrI, $187-$541), and $700 (95% CrI, $355-$1144) per patient for Mexico, Thailand, and China, respectively. Findings remained cost saving in deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Achieving optimal adherence in patients with cardiovascular disease requiring lipid-lowering therapy saves costs and improves health outcomes in Mexico, Thailand, and China. These findings support national health care systems implementing strategies to improve adherence in these countries."

    "abstract": "Atlantic reef-building corals and coral reefs continue to experience extensive decline due to increased stressors related to climate change, disease, pollution, and numerous anthropogenic threats. To understand the impact of ocean warming and reef loss on the estimated extinction risk of shallow water Atlantic reef-building scleractinians and milleporids, all 85 valid species were reassessed under the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria, updating the previous Red List assessment of Atlantic corals published in 2008. For the present assessment, individual species declines were estimated based on the modeled coral cover loss (1989-2019) and projected onset of annual severe bleaching events (2020-2050) across the Atlantic. Species traits were used to scale species' relative vulnerability to the modeled cover declines and forecasted bleaching events. The updated assessments place 45.88%-54.12% of Atlantic shallow water corals at an elevated extinction risk compared to the previous assessments conducted in 2008 (15.19%-40.51%). However, coral cover loss estimates indicate an improvement in reef coverage compared to the historic time-series used for the 2008 assessments. Based on this, we infer that, although remaining dangerously high, the rate of Atlantic reef coral cover decline has surprisingly slowed in recent decades. However, based on modeled projections of sea-surface temperature that predict the onset of annual severe bleaching events within the next 30 years, we listed 26 (out of 85) species as Critically Endangered in the IUCN Red List. Each of these species had previously been listed under a lower threatened category and this result alone highlights the severe threat future bleaching events pose to coral survival and the reef ecosystems they support."

    "abstract": "People living with sickle cell disease (SCD) experience complications indicative of an accelerated aging phenotype typified by early decline in physical function and increased risk for age-related conditions. Cellular senescence, measured by expression of p16<sup>INK4a</sup> in peripheral T-lymphocytes, is recognized as one of the underlying contributors to organismal aging. To examine if cellular senescence is increased in SCD patients, we cross-sectionally measured and compared expression of p16 mRNA in peripheral blood T lymphocytes in 18 adolescents and young adults with SCD to 27 similarly aged individuals without SCD. Expression of p16 was dramatically higher in individuals with SCD vs. without SCD (10.1 vs. 8.7 log<sub>2</sub> p16 units, respectively, <i>p</i> < 0.001) - a gap of 43 years in biological age - consistent with accelerated aging in the SCD population. Race was not associated with the increased p16 expression in the SCD group. These initial results suggest that individuals with SCD have a significantly higher cellular senescence burden which may contribute to premature aging, physiological decline, and excess morbidities. Additional longitudinal assessment and consideration for trials of senolytic therapies among individuals living with SCD and high p16 expression are warranted to improve their health span."

    "title": "Osteoarthritis and Neurological Disorder Diagnoses in Adults: A Meta-Analysis Examining Associations With Parkinson's Disease, Multiple Sclerosis, and Alzheimer's Disease.",
    "abstract": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is a highly prevalent joint disorder that is emerging as a global threat to health. OA is associated with low-grade chronic systemic inflammation that can affect overall health, leading to a sedentary lifestyle and potentially increased risk of neurological disorders (ND) such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and multiple sclerosis (MS). A meta-analysis was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for 2020 Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Embase databases were searched to identify records. The inclusion criteria for this analysis were original research articles reporting on OA and neurological disorder diagnoses (AD, PD, or MS) with non-OA comparator groups. Logarithmic odds ratios (LORs) were calculated and input into a random-effects meta-analysis using the restricted maximum-likelihood estimator. Subgroup analyses examined the associations between OA, AD, PD, and MS. A subsequent meta-regression analysis was performed to explore potential sources of heterogeneity, focusing on comorbidities and demographic factors. Publication bias was evaluated using funnel plots, Egger's test, and trim-and-fill analysis. Nine studies were included in this meta-analysis (six case-control designs, two cross-sectional designs, and one population-based cohort design) of 1,837,716 cases. The pooled odds ratio (OR) indicated a significant association between OA and ND diagnosis (OR = 1.246; confidence interval (CI): 1.01-1.53). Subsequent subgroup analyses were not statistically significant but indicated an association with PD (OR = 1.31, CI: 0.80-2.12), MS (OR = 1.12, CI: 0.80-2.81), and AD (OR = 1.50, CI: 0.80-2.81). This meta-analysis revealed that individuals with OA have approximately 25% higher odds of an accompanying ND diagnosis compared to those without OA. Importantly, these findings represent statistical associations only and do not imply causation or directionality but provide insight into factors, including shared risk factors, overlapping symptoms, or other underlying mechanisms that may influence the observed relationships."

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to ascertain whether patient age was a significant factor for the accurate identification of compressive intervertebral disc extrusions (IVDE) in Dachshunds using non-contrast computed tomography (CT). This retrospective analysis encompassed 150 Dachshunds evaluated for suspected IVDE at a referral hospital in south-eastern Queensland, Australia. Each case underwent diagnostic evaluation by CT, either with or without myelography, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), followed by surgical intervention for an intervertebral disc extrusion. In the <9-year dog cohort, 94.7% (71/75) were diagnosed with IVDE via non-contrast CT and proceeded to surgery. In contrast, the â¥9-year dog cohort, only 56% (42/75) were diagnosed via non-contrast CT, with the remaining 44% (33/75) necessitating CT myelography or MRI for diagnosis. The odds of requiring CT myelography or MRI increased 13.95-fold (95% CI, 4.62-42.13) in Dachshunds aged 9 years or older. Furthermore, each additional year of age was associated with a 0.60 increase in the odds of undergoing these advanced imaging modalities (CT myelography or MRI) (95% CI, 0.49-0.74). Age significantly affected the efficacy of non-contrast CT in diagnosing IVDE in Dachshunds. Dogs aged 9 years and above were substantially more likely to require CT myelography or MRI due to the reduced visibility of disc extrusions on non-contrast CT. Veterinarians performing advanced imaging on older Dachshunds for suspected IVDE should be aware of the limitations of non-contrast CT in obtaining an accurate diagnosis and localisation of IVDE, and be prepared to perform either CT myelography or MRI if required."

However, there is limited research on the use of teleophthalmology in retinoblastoma. The goal of this study was to explore how Orbis Cybersight affected the capacity for treatment and management of children with retinoblastoma through online mentorship and to assess the efficacy of online mentoring through disease-specific knowledge change over time. A retrospective review of Orbis Cybersight retinoblastoma consultations from 2004 to 2023 was conducted. Each participant was scored from 0 to 39 points on the basis of information provided throughout the consultation. These points were separated into six categories: patient history, clinical findings, grouping/staging, diagnostic findings, treatment plan, and patient and ocular outcomes. Data were analyzed by linear regression models to identify changes over time. Among 653 patients from 38 different mentees, significant improvement in total points over time was observed (Î² = .012 [SE, 0.004]; <i>P</i> = .009). The mean score for total points at first consult was 17.7 (standard deviation [SD], 3.5) and at fifth consult was 19.8 (SD, 5.2). Three management categories showed significant improvement: clinical findings (<i>P</i> = .005), grouping/staging (<i>P</i> < .0001), and patient and ocular outcomes (<i>P</i> = .002). However, there was a significant decline in patient history points over time (<i>P</i> = .0006). Mentorship via Orbis Cybersight improved retinoblastoma disease-specific knowledge and management over a 20-year period. Tele-education provides an opportunity for disease-specific capacity building in low- and middle-income countries for the treatment of retinoblastoma."

    "title": "Leader cells promote immunosuppression to drive ovarian cancer progression inÂ vivo.",
    "abstract": "Over 75% of patients with ovarian cancer present with late-stage disease, often accompanied by extensive metastasis. The metastatic cascade is driven by a sub-population of transcriptionally plastic cells known as \"leader cells\" (LCs), which play a critical role in collective invasion yet remain poorly understood. LCs are marked by the expression of keratin-14 (KRT14), which determines their migratory and invasive capacity in ovarian cancer. This study demonstrates that KRT14+ LCs promote tumor progression through immunosuppression and immune privilege in vivo. In the ID8 syngeneic epithelial ovarian cancer mouse model, tumor-specific loss of KRT14+ LCs impairs tumor progression and metastatic spread without affecting cellular proliferation. Immune profiling shows reduced immunosuppressive regulatory T cells (Tregs) and M2 macrophages and improved CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell/Treg ratios in LC knockout (LC<sup>KO</sup>) mice. Conversely, forced LC overexpression accelerates metastasis and increases the secretion of immunosuppressive chemokines, such as CCL22 and CCL5, highlighting the role of KRT14+ LCs in immune suppression and metastatic progression."

    "abstract": "Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) polygenic risk scores (PRSs) continue to be evaluated in primarily European-ancestry populations despite higher prevalence and worse outcomes in African-ancestry populations. To evaluate how established POAG PRSs perform in African-ancestry samples from the Genetics in Glaucoma Patients of African Descent (GIGA), Genetics of Glaucoma in Individuals of African Descent (GGLAD), and Million Veteran Program (MVP) datasets and compare these with European-ancestry samples. This was a multicenter, cross-sectional study of POAG cases and controls from Tanzania, South Africa, Nigeria, Ghana, and the US. Included were individuals of African descent from South Africa and Tanzania from the GIGA dataset; individuals of African descent from Ghana, Nigeria, and the US from the GGLAD dataset; and individuals of African or European descent from the US in the MVP dataset. Data were analyzed from January 2022 to July 2023. Three PRSs derived from large meta-analyses of European and Asian populations, namely Gharahkhani et al (Gharahkhani PRS), Han et al (Han PRS), and Craig et al (Craig PRS). Odds ratios (ORs) for POAG risk stratification comparing the highest and lowest quintiles; area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), and liability coefficient of determination (R2) for the addition of PRS to a baseline of age, sex, and first 5 principal components. A total of 11 673 cases and 66 432 controls were included in this study across 7 ancestral groups. Mean (SD) age of the total participants was 76.9 (8.7) years, with 74 304 males (95.1%). The following were included in each dataset: GIGA (663 cases, 476 controls), GGLAD (1471 cases, 1482 controls), and MVP (9559 cases, 64 474 controls). Increases in ORs were found for the highest POAG risk quintile ranging from an OR of 1.68 (95% CI, 1.17-2.43) in Ghanaians to 7.05 (95% CI, 2.73-19.6) in the South African multiple ancestry group (which derives from at least 5 distinct ancestral groups: Khoisan, Bantus, Europeans, Indians, and Southeast Asians) with the Gharahkhani PRS. The Han PRS showed OR increases for the highest POAG risk quintile ranging from 2.27 (95% CI, 1.49-3.47) in African American individuals in the GGLAD dataset to 7.24 (95% CI, 6.47-8.12) in Europeans. The Craig PRS predicted OR increases in the highest quintile for all groups ranging from 1.51 (95% CI, 1.05-2.18) in Ghanaians to 6.31 (95% CI, 5.67-7.04) in Europeans. However, AUROC and R2 increases above baseline were lower for all African-ancestry compared with European-ancestry groups in the 3 tested PRSs. In this cross-sectional study, despite some improvements in OR-based risk stratification using the Gharahkhani PRSs, Han PRSs, and Craig PRSs, consistently lower improvements in AUROC and R2 for African-ancestry compared with European-ancestry groups highlight the need for risk prediction models tailored to diverse populations."

    "abstract": "Helicobacter pylori is the primary cause of gastric cancer, and there is a need to discover new molecular targets for therapeutic intervention in H. pylori disease progression. We have previously shown that spermine oxidase (SMOX), the enzyme that catabolizes the back-conversion of the polyamine spermine to spermidine, is upregulated during infection and is associated with increased cancer risk in humans. We sought to determine the direct role of SMOX in gastric carcinogenesis during H. pylori infection. In this study, we demonstrate that transgenic FVB/N insulin-gastrin (INS-GAS) mice that develop gastric carcinoma with H. pylori infection were protected from cancer development with Smox deletion. RNA sequencing revealed that genes associated with the immune system and cancer were downregulated in the infected Smox<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Furthermore, there was a decrease in cell proliferation and DNA damage in infected Smox<sup>-/-</sup> animals. There was significant generation of adducts of the highly reactive electrophile acrolein, a byproduct of SMOX activity, in gastric tissues from H. pylori-infected humans and wild-type, but not Smox<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Genetic deletion of Smox in murine organoids or chemical inhibition of SMOX in human gastric epithelial cells significantly reduced generation of acrolein induced by H. pylori. Additionally, acrolein-induced DNA damage in gastric epithelial cells was ablated with the electrophile scavenger 2-hydroxybenzylamine (2-HOBA). Gastric acrolein adduct levels were attenuated in infected INS-GAS mice treated with 2-HOBA, which exhibit reduced gastric carcinoma. These findings implicate SMOX and acrolein in H. pylori-induced carcinogenesis, thus indicating their potential as therapeutic targets."

Cox proportional-hazards models identified significant image features which were integrated with subject demographics to predict the subject's overall hazard. Subjects were stratified using composite model predictions and feature-specific risk stratification thresholds. The model's performance was validated extensively, including 5-fold cross-validation on PLuSS baseline, PLuSS follow-up examinations, and the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST). The composite model had significantly improved prognostic ability compared to the baseline model (P < .01) with AUCs of 0.774 (95% CI: 0.757-0.792) on PLuSS, 0.723 (95% CI: 0.703-0.744) on PLuSS follow-up, and 0.681 (95% CI: 0.651-0.710) on the NLST cohort. The identified high-risk stratum were several times more likely to die, with mortality rates of 79.34% on PLuSS, 76.47% on PLuSS follow-up, and 46.74% on NLST. Two cardiopulmonary structures (intrapulmonary artery-vein ratio, intrapulmonary vein density) and two body composition tissues (SM density, bone density) identified high-risk patients. Body composition and pulmonary vasculatures are predictive of an individual's health risk; their integrations with subject demographics facilitate the assessment of an individual's overall health status or susceptibility to disease. CT-computed body composition and vasculature biomarkers provide improved prognostic value. The integration of CT biomarkers and patient demographic information improves subject risk stratification."

However, resistance to these small molecules has highlighted the need for rational combination partners necessitating a critical understanding of signaling downstream of KRAS mutant isoforms. We contrasted tumor development between Kras<sup>G12C</sup> and Kras<sup>G12D</sup> genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs). To corroborate findings and determine mutant subtype-specific dependencies, isogenic models of Kras<sup>G12C</sup> and Kras<sup>G12D</sup> initiation and adaptation were profiled by RNA sequencing. We also employed cell line models of established KRAS mutant NSCLC and determined therapeutic vulnerabilities through pharmacological inhibition. We analysed differences in survival outcomes for patients affected by advanced KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> or KRAS<sup>G12D</sup>-mutant NSCLC. KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> exhibited higher potency in vivo, manifesting as more rapid lung tumor formation and reduced survival of KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> GEMMs compared to KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>. This increased potency, recapitulated in an isogenic initiation model, was associated with enhanced PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling. However, KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> oncogenicity and downstream pathway activation were comparable with KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> at later stages of tumorigenesis in vitro and in vivo, consistent with similar clinical outcomes in patients. Despite this, established KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> NSCLC models depended more on the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway, while KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> models on the MAPK pathway. Specifically, KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> inhibition was enhanced by AKT inhibition in vitro and in vivo.

A mixed methods design with 61 semi-structured interviews and psychometrically validated questionnaires to assess pleural mesothelioma patients' (n = 36) quality of life and frailty and carers' (n = 25) caregiving experiences, quality of life, and pre-loss prolonged grief symptoms. People with mesothelioma (29 men, 7 women, aged 46-89 years) indicated moderate quality of life; 18 (50%) met criteria for frailty. Current carers (21 women, 4 men; aged 41-79 years) generally reported positive caregiving experiences and high quality of life; 5 (20%) scored in the range indicative of risk for prolonged grief disorder. Four themes were generated: a desire for tailored information with bespoke detail, assistance to coordinate tasks of treatment, improved social and peer support, and effective psychological services. Needs varied, with main concerns being about breaking the news to spouses/children, the impact of the disease and death on family, loss of personal future, managing psychological symptoms, and avoiding burden. These specific and unmet psychosocial needs provide a strong basis for individualised care pathways to address these needs via the integration of psychology into the multidisciplinary care team and the development and evaluation of mental health and wellbeing interventions for mesothelioma patients and carers.

Growing evidence supports the hypothesis that nonsense mutation identity affects therapeutic response, calling for mutation-specific CF models. We describe a novel W1282X mouse model and compare it to an existing G542X mouse. The W1282X mouse was created using CRISPR/Cas9 to edit mouse Cftr. In this model, Cftr transcription was assessed using qRT-PCR and CFTR function was measured in the airway by nasal potential difference and in the intestine by short circuit current. Growth, survival, and intestinal motility were examined as well. Correction of W1282X CFTR was assessed pharmacologically and by gene-editing using a forskolin-induced swelling (FIS) assay in small intestine-derived organoids. Homozygous W1282X mice demonstrate decreased Cftr mRNA, little to no CFTR function, and reduced survival, growth, and intestinal motility. W1282X organoids treated with various combinations of pharmacologic correctors display a significantly different amount of CFTR function than that of organoids from G542X mice. Successful gene editing of W1282X to wildtype sequence in intestinal organoids was achieved leading to restoration of CFTR function. The W1282X mouse model recapitulates common human manifestations of CF similar to other CFTR null mice. Despite the similarities between the congenic W1282X and G542X models, they differ meaningfully in their response to identical pharmacological treatments. This heterogeneity highlights the importance of studying therapeutics across genotypes."

    "title": "Epidemiology and Impact of Social Hardships in Children With Multiple Sclerosis in the United States.",
    "abstract": "Social determinants of health (SDOH) affect patient health outcomes, but the impact on patients with pediatric-onset multiple sclerosis (POMS) has not been well studied. Study objectives were to (1) describe the frequency of adverse SDOH, (2) evaluate social hardships as a potential barrier to the initiation of disease-modifying therapy (DMT), and (3) explore the association between adverse SDOH and disease outcomes in POMS, as well as study attrition. This was a retrospective multicenter observational study conducted through the United States Network of Pediatric MS Centers database. Participants were patients diagnosed with POMS (excluding primary progressive MS). The primary outcome was time to initiation of DMT. Secondary outcomes included most recent Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score, steroid treatment for the first event, time to second event, and study attrition. Demographic variables and clinical outcomes were compared between patients with and without hardships (maternal education of high school or less, public insurance/no insurance, or single/no-income household). Multivariable regression models were used to assess the impact of social hardship on study outcomes. There were 996 total participants (69% female, mean age at symptom onset and EDSS score [Â±SD] were 14.2 Â± 3 and 1.2 Â± 1.1, respectively). Of 768 patients with complete demographic information, 66% reported a hardship. Hardship was associated with younger age at symptom onset and diagnosis. While there was no difference in time to DMT initiation, patients with hardship were more likely to receive steroids for the first event (odds ratio [OR] 1.66, 95% CI 1.21-2.26, <i>p</i> = 0.002). Lack of private insurance was associated with increased risk of study attrition (OR 1.85, 95% CI 1.14-3.00, <i>p</i> = 0.012) and higher EDSS score (Î² = 0.15, 95% CI 0.01, 0.28). Living in a no-income household (vs dual-income) was associated with a shorter time to second event (hazard ratio 1.33, 95% CI 1.02-1.74, <i>p</i> = 0.034). The experience of hardships is common and associated with younger age at symptom onset and diagnosis, as well as shorter time to second event. Lack of private insurance is associated with study attrition and a higher EDSS score despite no difference in time to initiating DMT. There may be differences in early disease pathophysiology related to social hardship, and future studies are needed to better understand this complex relationship."

    "title": "Early insights from the routine use of patient reported outcome measures in elective hip and knee arthroplasty at a public teaching hospital in South Australia.",
    "abstract": "For advanced osteoarthritis of the knee and hip, the most clinically effective treatment remains total-knee arthroplasty (TKA) and total-hip arthroplasty (THA). Success of these surgeries have traditionally been appraised by economic and volume-based measures. There has been a shift towards the use of patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) to quantify success and guide treatment. The present study provides analysis of three PROMS which have been validated for use in orthopaedic settings; the Oxford Knee Score (OKS), Oxford Hip Score (OHS), Forgotten Joint Score (FJS), and the EuroQol-Visual Analogue Scale (EQ-VAS) - a non-disease specific measure of health. PROMs were completed pre-operatively, 6-weeks, and 1-year after elective TKA and THA undertaken in 2018 in a public teaching hospital in South Australia. Post-operative satisfaction/dissatisfaction was measured using a 5-point Likert scale and was collected at the same 6-week and 1-year points. PROMs were collected from 285 eligible elective knee-arthroplasty, and 205 elective hip-arthroplasty patients. There was significant average improvement, greater than minimal clinical important differences between pre-operative and 1-year post-operative scores for all three PROMs tools. Inter-PROM correlation was strongest between FJS and OKS at 1-year post TKA (r<sub>s</sub> = 0.722), and between FJS and OHS in post-THA at the same interval (r<sub>s</sub> = 0.609). TKA patients with higher pre-surgical 10-year mortality were weakly associated with lower pre-operative OKS score (r<sub>s</sub> = 0.169). BMI was weakly negatively associated with pre-operative and 6-week post-operative EQ-VAS scores (r<sub>s</sub> = -0.291 and r<sub>s</sub> = -0.149 respectively). Post-TKA satisfaction was 77.2% at 1-year, and THA 88.5% at the same interval. This study provides an early insight from the use of the OKS, OHS, the EQ-VAS and the FJS as PROMs in primary TKA and THA at our centre. All PROMs demonstrate significant increase (improvement) at both 6-week and 1-year post-operative intervals, relative to pre-operative scores. The FJS demonstrated good sensitivity. Pre-existing co-morbidities do not appear to have any significant relation with post-operative PROMs collected in this study."

    "abstract": "<b>Introduction.</b> <i>Strongyloides stercoralis</i>, the human threadworm, is a parasitic nematode with global distribution, estimated to infect over 600 million people. Chronic infection is often asymptomatic, but hyperinfection and dissemination syndromes can occur in the immunosuppressed with high case fatality rates. Whilst strongyloidiasis is endemic in Fiji, its prevalence in Fijian migrant groups in the UK is unknown.<b>Gap Statement.</b> No previous studies have been conducted on the prevalence of <i>Strongyloides</i> and other gastrointestinal parasites (GIPs) in Fijian migrants to the UK.<b>Aim.</b> We conducted a cross-sectional study of the prevalence of GIPs in a Fijian migrant population.<b>Methodology.</b> Participants completed a questionnaire on residence, travel and clinical symptoms and were asked to provide a serum sample for <i>S. stercoralis</i> IgG ELISA, venous blood samples for eosinophil count and a faecal sample for charcoal culture, multiplex real-time PCR (rtPCR) and microscopy after formalin-ethyl acetate concentration. Sequencing was performed on pooled <i>Strongyloides</i> larvae for nuclear 18S rRNA hyper-variable regions (HVRs) I and IV.<b>Results.</b> A total of 250 participants (94% male) with median (range) age 37 (20-51) years entered the study, 15 (1-24) years since leaving Fiji. <i>S. stercoralis</i> IgG ELISA was positive in 87/248 (35.1 %) and 14/74 (18.9 %) had a GIP detected in faeces. This included 7/74 (9.5 %) with <i>Strongyloides</i> and 5/74 (6.8 %) with hookworms. Dermatological symptoms were more common in those with <i>Strongyloides,</i> and eosinophilia (>0.5Ã10<sup>9</sup> cells per litre) was present in 55.6% of those with positive <i>S. stercoralis</i> IgG. rtPCR was the most sensitive faecal diagnostic test for <i>Strongyloides</i> and hookworms in faeces. Sequences of nuclear 18S rRNA for HVRs I and IV confirmed the presence of <i>S. stercoralis</i>.<b>Conclusion.</b> This first cross-sectional study in Fijian migrants found a high rate of chronic infection with GIPs, particularly <i>S. stercoralis</i>. Faecal microscopy was insensitive compared to charcoal culture, rtPCR or serology, demonstrating the importance of specialist parasitological tests when investigating people with a suspected chronic infection. Our study highlights an overlooked burden of strongyloidiasis in the UK and has implications for screening and treatment programmes in Fiji and for migrants from Fiji."

QTL mapping has been focused on multi-tissue expression QTLs or plasma protein QTLs (pQTLs). We generated a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pQTL atlas by measuring 6,361 proteins in 3,506 samples. We identified 3,885 associations for 1,883 proteins, including 2,885 new pQTLs, demonstrating unique genetic regulation in CSF. We identified CSF-enriched pleiotropic regions on chromosome (chr)3q28 near OSTN and chr19q13.32 near APOE that were enriched for neuron specificity and neurological development. We integrated our associations with Alzheimer's disease (AD) through proteome-wide association study (PWAS), colocalization and Mendelian randomization and identified 38 putative causal proteins, 15 of which have drugs available. Finally, we developed a proteomics-based AD prediction model that outperforms genetics-based models. These findings will be instrumental to further understand the biology and identify causal and druggable proteins for brain and neurological traits."

    "abstract": "DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A) plays a critical role in establishing and maintaining DNA methylation patterns in vertebrates. Here we structurally and biochemically explore the interaction of DNMT3A1 with diverse modified nucleosomes indicative of different chromatin environments. A cryo-EM structure of the full-length DNMT3A1-DNMT3L complex with a H2AK119ub nucleosome reveals that the DNMT3A1 ubiquitin-dependent recruitment (UDR) motif interacts specifically with H2AK119ub and makes extensive contacts with the core nucleosome histone surface. This interaction facilitates robust DNMT3A1 binding to nucleosomes, and previously unexplained DNMT3A disease-associated mutations disrupt this interface. Furthermore, the UDR-nucleosome interaction synergises with other DNMT3A chromatin reading elements in the absence of histone ubiquitylation. H2AK119ub does not stimulate DNMT3A DNA methylation activity, as observed for the previously described H3K36me2 mark, which may explain low levels of DNA methylation on H2AK119ub marked facultative heterochromatin. This study highlights the importance of multivalent binding of DNMT3A to histone modifications and the nucleosome surface and increases our understanding of how DNMT3A1 chromatin recruitment occurs."

    "abstract": "Mowat-Wilson syndrome (MWS) is a complex disorder caused by heterozygous ZEB2 gene variations creating haploinsufficiency. The main clinical features are evolving facial dysmorphism, intellectual disability, eye and brain malformations, and various organ anomalies. Our study examines 10 Turkish patients, who had clinical diagnosis, underwent evaluation, clinical investigations, and genetic tests in multiple tertiary centers across TÃ¼rkiye, and were molecularly diagnosed with MWS. Molecular analysis with sequencing techniques alongside array testing unveiled disease-causing variations in addition to novel variants, including two siblings with recurrent multiexon deletion. Clinical presentations varied, featuring neurodevelopmental delay and characteristic facial traits and organ malformations across all cases, alongside less frequently reported manifestations such as laryngomalacia or rocker bottom feet in addition to new features such as macroorchidism and osteoporosis. Our findings expand the genetic and phenotypical spectrum of MWS, and hint at potential implications of gonadal mosaicism. While establishing clear genotype-phenotype correlations poses challenges, comprehensive genetic testing remains pivotal for precise diagnosis and management. The study highlights the complexity of MWS genetics, with potential implications of gonadal mosaicism on recurrence. Further research is needed to elucidate mechanisms driving phenotypic variability, potential hotspots, and mechanisms for recurrent variations. We report on the largest cohort with MWS from TÃ¼rkiye."

    "abstract": "Magnolia officinalis Rehder & E.H. Wilson is traditionally used in the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders, diarrhea, and cough. Its main active ingredient, magnolol, exhibits protective effects on the lungs and gastrointestinal tract, including the inhibition of inflammation in these organs. This work aims to explore the molecular mechanism by which magnolol suppressed Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) intestinal damage by improving the intestinal epithelial barrier. The study focused on investigating the mitigation effect of magnolol on intestinal injury and epithelial barrier in a COPD rat. Caco-2 cells were induced with TNF-Î± or IL-1Î² to establish the barrier injury model in order to explore the direct protective effect of magnolol on the intestinal barrier and elucidate the molecular mechanism by which it activates peroxisome proliferators-activated receptors-Î³ (PPARÎ³). Magnolol significantly improves pulmonary function and tissue damage in COPD rats by inhibiting inflammation, protease imbalance, and oxidative stress. It also suppresses colon tissue damage and inflammation, and protects colon epithelial barrier function by suppressing the decline of tight junction proteins, reducing colon epithelial permeability. In Caco-2 cells, magnolol directly reduces monolayer permeability, increases TEER, and upregulates tight junction protein expression induced by TNF-Î± or IL-1Î². Drug Affinity Responsive Target Stability (DARTS) and thermal shift assays show that magnolol effectively binds to SRC, activating PPARÎ³ signaling in Caco-2 cells and colon tissues of COPD rats. Furthermore, magnolol enhances the binding of PPARÎ³ and RXRÎ±, promoting their activation and entry into the nucleus. The PPARÎ³ inhibitor GW9662 can reverse the effects of magnolol on PPARÎ³ activation and tight junction protein upregulation in IL-1Î² or TNF-Î± induced Caco-2 cells. This work demonstrates that magnolol enhances lung and intestinal functions in COPD rats, and elucidates its mechanism of action in protecting the intestinal epithelial barrier by activating PPARÎ³."

Relevant clinical, laboratory, and radiologic data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. <b>Results:</b> There were 268 patients, including 162 (60.4%) males and 106 (39.6%) females. The mean age was 54 Â± 15.2 years (range 16 to 71 years). The most common cause of CLD was metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) at 45.5%. The most common referring physician group was Gastroenterology at 62.7%. In 23.9% of cases, the reason for ordering the MRI was a pre-existing failed or unreliable US elastography. There were 17 cases (6.3%) of MRI technical failure. Our analysis revealed liver fibrosis in 66% of patients, steatosis in 68.3%, and iron overload in 22.1%. Combined fibrosis and steatosis were seen in 28.7%, steatosis and iron overload in 16.8%, fibrosis and iron overload in 6%, and combined fibrosis, steatosis, and iron overload in 4.1%. A positive MEFIB index, a predictor of liver-related outcomes, was found in 57 (27.5%) of 207 patients. Incidental findings were found in 14.9% of all MRIs. <b>Conclusions:</b> The liver triple screen MRI is an effective tool for evaluating liver fat, iron, and fibrosis in patients with CLD. It provides essential clinical information and can help identify MASLD patients at risk for liver-related outcomes."

    "title": "Copper and Colorectal Cancer.",
    "abstract": "Minerals constitute only 5% of the typical human diet but are vital for health and functionality. Copper, a trace element, is absorbed by the human gut at 30-40% from diets typical of industrialized countries. The liver produces metallothioneins, which store copper. Copper is crucial for mitochondrial respiration, pigmentation, iron transport, antioxidant defense, hormone production, and extracellular matrix biosynthesis. Copper deficiency, often caused by mutations in the <i>ATP7A</i> gene, results in Menkes disease, an X-linked recessive disorder. On the contrary, Wilson disease is characterized by toxic copper accumulation. Cuproptosis, a unique form of cell death regulated by copper, is a subtype of necrosis induced by enhanced mitochondrial metabolism and intracellular copper accumulation. This process can reduce the malignant potential of tumor cells by inhibiting glucose metabolism. Therapeutically, copper and its complexes have shown efficacy in malignancy treatments. The disruption of copper homeostasis and excessive cuproplasia are significant in colorectal cancer development and metastasis. Therefore, manipulating copper status presents a potential therapeutic target for colorectal cancer, using copper chelators to inhibit copper formation or copper ion carriers to promote cuproptosis. This review highlights the role of copper in human physiology and pathology, emphasizing its impact on colorectal cancer and potential therapeutic strategies. Future AI-based approaches are anticipated to accelerate the development of new compounds targeting cuproptosis and copper disruption in colorectal cancer."

To evaluate the differences and trends in single- and multiple-team sport participation among US high school students between 1999 and 2019. Descriptive epidemiology study. Using the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a biannual representative survey of US high school students, data on self-reported sport participation (no participation, single team, multiple teams) within the previous year were evaluated. Differences in sport participation prevalence between 1999 and 2019 were assessed in sex strata by grade, race/ethnicity, and US region. Weighted trends using the National Center for Health Statistics Guidelines for Analysis of Trends and logistic regression models were employed for analyses. The study sample over the 20-year period (N = 149,404) was 49.8% female; the majority were in ninth grade (27.7% female, 28.7% male), were non-Hispanic White (56.1% female, 56.8% male), and resided in the Southern US (57.6% female, 57.4% male).

A total of 30 WD patients with stable copper metabolism were identified for treatment with TETA 2-HCl (Cufenceâ¢) after prior use of TETA 4-HCl (Cupriorâ¢). Biochemical markers including urinary copper, non-ceruloplasmin bound copper (NCC) and liver function were analyzed at baseline and followed up over 12 months. Safety was assessed based on reported adverse events (AEs). Urinary copper levels and NCC remained stable across all follow-ups, indicating adequate copper metabolism control. Reported AEs during TETA 2-HCl treatment were mostly gastrointestinal discomfort (<i>n</i> = 6). In two patients, progressive elevation of transaminases occurred (despite stable copper metabolism). AEs led to discontinuation of treatment in five cases. Median baseline dose per day was 10.2 mg TETA 4-HCl/kg bodyweight, whereas median baseline dose after therapeutic switch to TETA 2-HCl was 12.8 mg/kg bodyweight. Median daily dose at 12 months did not differ significantly from TETA 2-HCl dose at switching timepoint, with stable biochemical markers and markers of copper metabolism in most (25/30) of the patients. Transitioning from TETA 4-HCl to TETA 2-HCl maintained stable copper parameters and liver function in most of analyzed patients. TETA 2-HCl treatment was generally well tolerated, suggesting that switching medications is safe and effective. In our real-life cohort, adjustment factor of ~1.25Ã for the switch of TETA 4-HCl to TETA 2-HCl resulted in adequate copper metabolism control."

Skunks serve as a natural definitive host for this metastrongylid nematode in North America, in which infections result in observable damage to the host cranium, where adult parasites reside. Additionally, skunks are considered the primary reservoir of rabies in Texas. In November 2022, the animal was discovered in northern Texas displaying neurologic signs before euthanasia and submission to the Oklahoma Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory for rabies testing. Direct fluorescent antibody testing indicated that the animal was rabies-positive, and, upon tissue collection, numerous adult nematodes were recovered from the cranium and identified as <i>S. chitwoodorum</i> by morphology and amplification of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene.

    "abstract": "<i> Salmonella enterica serovar</i> Typhimurium (STm) is a causative pathogen for robust inflammatory gastrointestinal disease and can lead to systemic infection. Eicosanoids, bioactive lipid mediators, play a crucial role in modulating both the induction and resolution of inflammatory responses during an infection. A subset of eicosanoids activates PPARs, nuclear receptor/transcription factors that regulate fatty acid metabolism, lipid body formation, and macrophage function. In this study, we determined that mice lacking PPARÎ± exhibited reduced inflammatory hallmarks of STm infection, including lower inflammatory gene expression, cecal inflammation, and bacterial dissemination, along with a significant increase in cecal eicosanoid metabolism compared to wildtype C57BL/6 mice. In macrophages, STm favored M2b-polarized macrophages for intracellular infection, leading to reduced arachidonic acid and ceramide production. Inhibition of fatty acid oxidation via Etomoxir in STm-infected macrophages reduced bacterial burdens and promoted cell death. In Etomoxir-treated wildtype mice, STm infection increased ceramide production, decreased inflammatory gene expression in the cecum, and increased the number of STm-containing M1 macrophages in mesenteric lymph nodes. These findings revealed a novel role for the lipid-immune signaling axis in <i>Salmonella</i> infections, providing significant insights into the lipid-mediated regulation of inflammation during bacterial infections in the gut."

Although H&E is ubiquitous and reveals tissue microanatomy, the classification and mapping of cell subtypes often require the use of specialized stains. The recent CoNIC Challenge focused on artificial intelligence classification of six types of cells on colon H&E but was unable to classify epithelial subtypes (progenitor, enteroendocrine, goblet), lymphocyte subtypes (B, helper T, cytotoxic T), and connective subtypes (fibroblasts). We propose to use inter-modality learning to label previously un-labelable cell types on H&E. We took advantage of the cell classification information inherent in multiplexed immunofluorescence (MxIF) histology to create cell-level annotations for 14 subclasses. Then, we performed style transfer on the MxIF to synthesize realistic virtual H&E. We assessed the efficacy of a supervised learning scheme using the virtual H&E and 14 subclass labels. We evaluated our model on virtual H&E and real H&E. On virtual H&E, we were able to classify helper T cells and epithelial progenitors with positive predictive values of <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mrow><mn>0.34</mn> <mo>Â±</mo> <mn>0.15</mn></mrow> </math> (prevalence <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mrow><mn>0.03</mn> <mo>Â±</mo> <mn>0.01</mn></mrow> </math> ) and <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mrow><mn>0.47</mn> <mo>Â±</mo> <mn>0.1</mn></mrow> </math> (prevalence <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mrow><mn>0.07</mn> <mo>Â±</mo> <mn>0.02</mn></mrow> </math> ), respectively, when using ground truth centroid information. On real H&E, we needed to compute bounded metrics instead of direct metrics because our fine-grained virtual H&E predicted classes had to be matched to the closest available parent classes in the coarser labels from the real H&E dataset. For the real H&E, we could classify bounded metrics for the helper T cells and epithelial progenitors with upper bound positive predictive values of <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mrow><mn>0.43</mn> <mo>Â±</mo> <mn>0.03</mn></mrow> </math> (parent class prevalence 0.21) and <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mrow><mn>0.94</mn> <mo>Â±</mo> <mn>0.02</mn></mrow> </math> (parent class prevalence 0.49) when using ground truth centroid information. This is the first work to provide cell type classification for helper T and epithelial progenitor nuclei on H&E."

    "abstract": "Group B <i>Streptococcus</i> (GBS) significantly contributes to neonatal sepsis and meningitis, with varying disease rates reported globally and limited population-based data. We estimated infant GBS disease burden in Ontario, Canada and assessed the association of maternal GBS screening (35-37 weeks' gestation) and intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) provision with infant disease rates. Our population-based cohort study included pregnant individuals and their offspring from April 2012 to March 2018, utilising the provincial birth registry linked to health administrative data. GBS cases were ascertained through culture results and diagnostic codes. We calculated incidence rates for early-onset disease (EOD: 0-6 days), late-onset disease (LOD: 7-89 days), and ultra-LOD (ULOD: 90-365 days). Adjusted incidence rate ratios (aIRR) were derived via log-binomial regression to compare infant GBS rates according to screening and IAP-receipt. Among 776,148 liveborn infants, we identified 803 with GBS, with multiples exhibiting a threefold incidence increase. Incidence rates of EOD, LOD and ULOD were 0.49, 0.46 and 0.07 per 1000 livebirths, respectively. Of eligible pregnancies, 94% were screened; 23% screened positive, and 81% of them received IAP. Nearly 12% of term EOD infants had mothers who missed IAP despite screening positive. Maternal screening was associated with lower rates of any infant GBS disease (aIRR: 0.60; 95% CI: 0.45, 0.80). Among screen-positive births, IAP-receipt was associated with reduced rates of EOD (aIRR: 0.72, 95% CI: 0.48, 1.29) and LOD/ULOD (aIRR: 0.69; 95% CI: 0.46, 1.05), but confidence intervals included 1.0. Our study, the largest Canadian investigation into infant GBS disease, highlights both widespread adoption and ongoing challenges of the current prevention strategy.

    "abstract": "In people with nonâdialysis-dependent CKD, revascularization may lower all-cause mortality and risk of cardiovascular events. Adverse kidney events, which are often cited as a reason to avoid revascularization, were uncommon. Additional research on the effect of revascularization on patient-reported outcomes in people with nonâdialysis-dependent CKD is needed. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in people with CKD. Coronary revascularization can improve cardiac function and prognosis in people with ischemic heart disease; however, in people with CKD, there is concern that potential harms could outweigh benefits of revascularization. Evidence on the balance of these risks and benefits, specifically in people with nonâdialysis-dependent CKD, is lacking. We conducted a systematic review of randomized controlled trials to assess the risks and benefits of revascularization, compared with medical management, among adults or children with ischemic heart disease and CKD not requiring KRT (dialysis or transplantation). We searched PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials through December 12, 2023. Two people independently screened titles and abstracts followed by full-text review, serially extracted data using standardized forms, independently assessed risk of bias, and graded the certainty of evidence (COE). Evaluating data from nine randomized controlled trials, we found that people with CKD and ischemic heart disease treated with revascularization may experience lower all-cause mortality compared with people receiving medical management (risk ratio [RR], 0.80; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.64 to 0.98; COE, low). Revascularization may reduce incidence of myocardial infarction (RR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.64 to 1.04; COE, low) and heart failure (RR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.52 to 1.23; COE, low). The effect on cardiovascular mortality is uncertain (hazard ratio, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.37 to 1.20; COE, very low). Evidence was insufficient for patient-reported outcomes and adverse kidney events. Data were limited by heterogeneity of patient populations and the limited number of trials. In people with nonâdialysis-dependent CKD, revascularization may be associated with lower all-cause mortality compared with medical management and may also lower the risk of cardiovascular events. Additional data surrounding kidney and patient-reported outcomes are needed to comprehensively engage in shared decision making and determine optimal treatment strategies for people with CKD and ischemic heart disease.

    "abstract": "This good practice paper (GPP) is intended to support clinicians in assessing patient fitness for bleomycin and in management of bleomycin pulmonary toxicity (BPT) where it occurs. Bleomycin, originally developed as an antibiotic in the 1960s, has been a cornerstone of therapy for classical Hodgkin lymphoma (CHL) since results of its use in combination with doxorubicin, vincristine and dacarbazine (ABVD) were first published by Bonadonna et al in 1975 1. The same author recognised high rates of respiratory morbidity in these patients 2, and bleomycin-;related pulmonary toxicity (BPT) is now a well-;recognised and feared complication with its use. ABVD and BEACOPP/ BEACOPDac (bleomycin, cyclophosphamide, etoposide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisolone, with procarbazine or dacarbazine) are standard first-;line treatments in CHL patients, but considerable variation remains in assessing patient fitness for bleomycin both clinically and with respiratory investigations. A recent survey of British haematologists regularly using bleomycin revealed that 87.5% have no local protocols for assessing patients in an evidence-;based fashion, with wide variations in practice captured in the same survey (personal data). A working group was established and a literature review undertaken with the goal of presenting practical recommendations for clinicians regarding bleomycin use based on available evidence and expert opinion."

Patient data are often stored in unstructured text and siloed datasets. Here we combine natural language processing annotations<sup>1,2</sup> with structured medication, patient-reported demographic, tumour registry and tumour genomic data from 24,950 patients at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center to generate a clinicogenomic, harmonized oncologic real-world dataset (MSK-CHORD). MSK-CHORD includes data for non-small-cell lung (n = 7,809), breast (n = 5,368), colorectal (n = 5,543), prostate (n = 3,211) and pancreatic (n = 3,109) cancers and enables discovery of clinicogenomic relationships not apparent in smaller datasets. Leveraging MSK-CHORD to train machine learning models to predict overall survival, we find that models including features derived from natural language processing, such as sites of disease, outperform those based on genomic data or stage alone as tested by cross-validation and an external, multi-institution dataset. By annotating 705,241 radiology reports, MSK-CHORD also uncovers predictors of metastasis to specific organ sites, including a relationship between SETD2 mutation and lower metastatic potential in immunotherapy-treated lung adenocarcinoma corroborated in independent datasets. We demonstrate the feasibility of automated annotation from unstructured notes and its utility in predicting patient outcomes. The resulting data are provided as a public resource for real-world oncologic research."

    "abstract": "Studies have used extensive clinical information to predict time-to-heart failure (HF) in patients with and without diabetes mellitus (DM). We aimed to determine a screening method using only computed tomography calcium scoring (CTCS) to assess HF risk. We analyzed CTCS scans from 1,998 patients (336 with type 2 diabetes) from a no-charge coronary artery calcium score registry (CLARIFY Study, Clinicaltrials.gov NCT04075162). We used deep learning to segment epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) and engineered radiomic features of calcifications (\"calcium-omics\") and EAT (\"fat-omics\"). We developed models incorporating radiomics to predict risk of incident HF in patients with and without type 2 diabetes. At a median follow-up of 1.7 years, 5% had incident HF. In the overall cohort, fat-omics (C-index: 77.3) outperformed models using clinical factors, EAT volume, Agatston score, calcium-omics, and calcium-and-fat-omics to predict HF. For DM patients, the calcium-omics model (C-index: 81.8) outperformed other models. In conclusion, CTCS-based models combining calcium and fat-omics can predict incident HF, outperforming prediction scores based on clinical factors.Please check article title if captured correctly.YesPlease check and confirm that the authors and their respective affiliations have been correctly identified and amend if necessary.Yes."

    "abstract": "Genetic variation at the 19q13.3 KLK locus is linked with prostate cancer susceptibility in men. The non-synonymous KLK3 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs17632542 (c.536 T > C; Ile163Thr-substitution in PSA) is associated with reduced prostate cancer risk, however, the functional relevance is unknown. Here, we identify that the SNP variant-induced change in PSA biochemical activity mediates prostate cancer pathogenesis. The 'Thr' PSA variant leads to small subcutaneous tumours, supporting reduced prostate cancer risk. However, 'Thr' PSA also displays higher metastatic potential with pronounced osteolytic activity in an experimental metastasis in-vivo model. Biochemical characterisation of this PSA variant demonstrates markedly reduced proteolytic activity that correlates with differences in in-vivo tumour burden. The SNP is associated with increased risk for aggressive disease and prostate cancer-specific mortality in three independent cohorts, highlighting its critical function in mediating metastasis. Carriers of this SNP allele have reduced serum total PSA and a higher free/total PSA ratio that could contribute to late biopsy decisions and delay in diagnosis. Our results provide a molecular explanation for the prominent 19q13.3 KLK locus, rs17632542 SNP, association with a spectrum of prostate cancer clinical outcomes."

Recently, in a scientific exploration of the Guinea Worm Eradication Program to Chad, Africa, we observed that dogs with mutilated ears, based on local awareness, were caused by cutaneous myiasis. In this study, we analyzed epidemiological, morphological, and molecular data on cutaneous myiasis in dogs from Chad. From September to October 2022, dogs (n = 1,562) from 56 villages situated along the Chari River were physically inspected for cutaneous myiasis. All larvae were collected and identified morphologically and by molecular analysis of the partial cytochrome oxidase c subunit I (COI) mitochondrial gene. The prevalence of myiasis infestation along with 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CI) was determined using the modified Wilson method. Myiasis was detected in dogs from 21 villages (37.5 %; 95 % CI 26 - 50 %), predominating in the southernmost region. Of 1,562 dogs, 66 (4.22 %; 95 % CI 3.34 - 5.34 %) were infested by calliphorid larvae, with a mean infestation of 2.28 larvae per animal (range = 1 to 24). Specimens were morphologically identified as Cordylobia anthropophaga (n = 94), Chrysomya bezziana (n = 54), and Chrysomya sp. (n = 3), which were detected in 57, eight and one dog, respectively. No co-infestations were observed. The molecular analyses confirmed the morphological identification and revealed the presence of 17 haplotypes for C. anthropophaga, 2 for C. bezziana, and one for Chrysomya sp. Our study emphasizes the veterinary importance of myiasis in dogs in Africa and proposes measures to assure their health and well-being."

Recent advances in statistical methodologies for performing inferential statistics to compare commonly used test metrics for two diagnostic tests have not yet been implemented in a statistical package. Up-to-date statistical methods to compare the test metrics achieved by two binary diagnostic tests are implemented in the new R package testCompareR. The output and efficiency of testCompareR is compared to the only other available package which performs this function, DTComPair, as well as an open-source program, compbdt, using a motivating example. testCompareR achieves similar results to DTComPair using statistical methods with improved coverage and asymptotic performance. Further, testCompareR is faster than the currently available package and requires fewer pre-processing steps in order to produce accurate results. testCompareR provides a new tool to compare the test metrics for two binary diagnostic tests compared with the gold standard. This tool allows flexible inputs, which minimises the need for data pre-processing, and operates in very few steps, so that it is easy to use even for those less experienced with R. testCompareR achieves results comparable to those computed by DTComPair, using optimised statistical methods and with improved computational efficiency."

Many previous reports indicated that mutations in <i>ATP7B</i> are well known to cause defective copper transporting copper-transporting ATPase 2 protein leading to the accumulation of copper, resulting the Wilson disease. The meta-analysis was performed to comprehensive gain a thorough grasp of the spectrum of genetic variations. A meta-analysis was conducted according to the guiding of PRISMA. aiming to assess the diversity and frequency of mutations in the <i>ATP7B</i> gene, with an emphasis on mutations located within specific exons. The dataset of detected mutations within their positions, types as well as nomenclature, were recorded from previous studies (spanning the year from 2013 to 2023). The analysis focused on exon-specific variations and their prevalence across different populations. A total of 40 studies were enrolled into current data analysis. Our comprehensive study revealed a variety of mutations, most notably over 50% of single nucleotide changes described, distributed over the 21 exons of the gene. Focusing on the exon 8, itisplayed the most diversity of mutations, with 18 studies identifying 53 unique variants, the majority of which were missense mutations (81.13%). Additionally, the variations c.2333G>A/T (p.R778Q/L), c.2305A>G (p.M769V), c.2336G>A (p.W779*), and c.2304dupC (p.M769HfsX26) are reported in many populations. The weighted mean of variants' proportion was used to calculate the pooled estimate of these percentages, which were 14.19% for c.2333G>A/T (p.R778Q/L), 2.70% for c.2305A>G (p.M769V), 1.42% for c.2336G>A (p.W779*), and 2.33% for c.2304dupC (p.M769HfsX26).

OCNDS has an evolving clinical phenotype predominantly characterized by intellectual disability, global delays, dysmorphic features, and immunological manifestations. Microcephaly, defined as a small head circumference, is not widely recognized as a classical clinical presentation. Here, we describe four individuals from three unrelated families who shared several clinical features characteristic of an underlying syndromic neurodevelopmental condition. Trio clinical exome and research genome sequencing revealed that all affected individuals had heterozygous pathogenic missense variants in CSNK2A1. Two variants (c.468T>A p.Asp156Glu and c.149A>G p.Tyr50Cys) were de novo and previously reported, but the third variant (c.137G>T p.Gly46Val) is novel and segregated in two affected individuals in a family. This adds to growing evidence of inherited disease-causing variants in CSNK2A1, an observation reported only twice previously. A detailed phenotypic analysis of our cohort together with those individuals reported in the literature revealed that OCNDS individuals, on average, have a smaller head circumference with one-third presenting with microcephaly. We also show that the incidence of microcephaly is significantly correlated with the location of the variant in the encoded protein. Our findings suggest that small head circumference is a common but under-recognized feature of OCNDS, which may not be apparent at birth."

Children in Papua New Guinea (PNG) experience profound morbidity from ALRI caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. As a result of evolutionary divergence, the human PNG population exhibits profound genetic variation and diversity. To address unmet health needs of children in PNG, we tested whether genetic variants increased ALRI morbidity. Whole-exome sequencing of a pilot child cohort identified homozygosity for a novel single-nucleotide variant (SNV) in coenzyme Q6 (COQ6) in cases with ALRI. COQ6 encodes a mitochondrial enzyme essential for biosynthesis of ubiquinone, an electron acceptor in the electron transport chain. A significant association of SNV homozygosity with ALRI was replicated in an independent ALRI cohort (P = 0.036). Mice homozygous for homologous mouse variant Coq6 exhibited increased mortality after pneumococcal lung infection, confirming causality. Bone marrow chimeric mice further revealed that expression of variant Coq6 in recipient (that is, nonhematopoietic) tissues conferred increased mortality. Variant Coq6 maintained ubiquinone biosynthesis, while accelerating metabolic remodeling after pneumococcal challenge. Identification of this COQ6 variant provides a genetic basis for increased pneumonia susceptibility in PNG and establishes a previously unrecognized role for the enzyme COQ6 in regulating inflammatory-mediated metabolic remodeling."

Following UK healthcare devolution in 1999, each nation has developed and implemented their own strategies for managing the growing demands on acute ophthalmology services. Local commissioning across England has seen Enhanced Service Pathways develop to provide acute eye care by primary care optometrists, with provision and access dependent upon locality. Northern Ireland has seen the implementation of a nationwide Primary Eyecare Acute Referral Service, whilst in Scotland and Wales, the respective Governments have redesigned primary care optometry General Ophthalmic Service contracts to incorporate provision of extended investigations and management of acute conditions by optometrists across the nation, recognising the added benefit of optometrists with higher qualifications. This narrative review summarises both peer reviewed and appropriate grey literature articles reporting on acute eye care pathways in primary care. Despite significant progress, particularly during the global COVID-19 pandemic, there is arguably still a great deal of further research and evaluation required relating to pathway innovation, the role of professionals with higher qualifications, including independent prescribing, the role of telemedicine, reassurance around clinical safety, and how digital interconnectivity could potentially add value to collaborative schemes to meet the growing demand on acute eyecare."

We evaluated the effectiveness of original monovalent and bivalent (ancestral strain and Omicron BA.4/5) COVID-19 vaccination against COVID-19-associated hospitalization and severe in-hospital outcomes. During September 8, 2022 to August 31, 2023, adults aged â¥ 18 years hospitalized with COVID-19-like illness were enrolled at 26 hospitals in 20 US states. Using a test-negative case-control design, we estimated vaccine effectiveness (VE) with multivariable logistic regression adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, admission date, and geographic region. Among 7028 patients, 2924 (41.6%) were COVID-19 case patients, and 4104 (58.4%) were control patients. Compared to unvaccinated patients, absolute VE against COVID-19-associated hospitalization was 6% (-7%-17%) for original monovalent doses only (median time since last dose [IQR] = 421 days [304-571]), 52% (39%-61%) for a bivalent dose received 7-89 days earlier, and 13% (-10%-31%) for a bivalent dose received 90-179 days earlier. Absolute VE against COVID-19-associated invasive mechanical ventilation or death was 51% (34%-63%) for original monovalent doses only, 61% (35%-77%) for a bivalent dose received 7-89 days earlier, and 50% (11%-71%) for a bivalent dose received 90-179 days earlier. Bivalent vaccination provided protection against COVID-19-associated hospitalization and severe in-hospital outcomes within 3 months of receipt, followed by a decline in protection to a level similar to that remaining from previous original monovalent vaccination by 3-6 months. These results underscore the benefit of remaining up to date with recommended COVID-19 vaccines."

Under three models of putative CNV impact (deletion, duplication, and loss of function), genome-wide association studies identified 141 candidate gene loci associated (p < 0.01) with endometrial cancer risk.

Together, these data provide evidence that rare copy number variants have a role in endometrial cancer susceptibility and that the proximal 16p11.2 BP4-BP5 region contains 25 candidate risk gene(s) that warrant further analysis to better understand their role in human disease."

    "title": "A Target Class Ligandability Evaluation of WD40 Repeat-Containing Proteins.",
    "abstract": "Target class-focused drug discovery has a strong track record in pharmaceutical research, yet public domain data indicate that many members of protein families remain unliganded. Here we present a systematic approach to scale up the discovery and characterization of small molecule ligands for the WD40 repeat (WDR) protein family. We developed a comprehensive suite of protocols for protein production, crystallography, and biophysical, biochemical, and cellular assays. A pilot hit-finding campaign using DNA-encoded chemical library selection followed by machine learning (DEL-ML) to predict ligands from virtual libraries yielded first-in-class, drug-like ligands for 7 of the 16 WDR domains screened, thus demonstrating the broader ligandability of WDRs. This study establishes a template for evaluation of protein family wide ligandability and provides an extensive resource of WDR protein biochemical and chemical tools, knowledge, and protocols to discover potential therapeutics for this highly disease-relevant, but underexplored target class."

    "title": "Understanding paediatric laryngomalacia: a study of social determinants and associated diseases.",
    "abstract": "This study investigated the influence of socioeconomic factors on the incidence of laryngomalacia in paediatric in-patients. Data from the 2016 Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project Kid Inpatient Database were analysed. Variables included zip code median income, race and/or ethnicity, primary expected payer and associated International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10th Revision codes in admission. Lower median income zip codes showed a 6.4 per cent increase in laryngomalacia admissions, while higher-income zip codes had an 8.0 per cent decrease. Black patients exhibited a 24.5 per cent increase and Asian or Pacific Islander patients showed a 42.5 per cent decrease in laryngomalacia admissions. Medicaid and other government programme payers had a 22.1 per cent increase, while Medicare, private insurance and self-pay patients had decreases of 35.5, 20.9 and 55.7 per cent, respectively. Laryngomalacia was associated with a number of disease processes from a multitude of organ systems in a statistically significant manor. Socioeconomic status, race, primary expected payer and co-morbid disease process significantly impact laryngomalacia admissions."

    "title": "D-Penicillamine-Induced Stevens-Johnson Syndrome in a Patient with Gold Cyanide Intoxication: A Case Report.",
    "abstract": "D-penicillamine is used as the mainstay of chelation therapy for Wilson's disease and for heavy metal intoxication. D-penicillamine itself has been noted to cause several systemic side effects as well as symptoms related to the skin. Common cutaneous side effects such as acute hypersensitivity reactions, elastic fiber abnormalities, and bullous diseases have been occasionally described. Herein, we report a case of a 23-year-old Thai female with gold intoxication who developed Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) following the treatment of D-penicillamine. To our knowledge, D-penicillamine-induced SJS is exceptionally rare. To raise awareness of potentially fatal cutaneous adverse drug reaction triggered by D-penicillamine, published literature regarding SJS induced by this agent has also been reviewed. D-penicillamine should be regarded as a possible culprit in patients presenting with SJS following D-penicillamine administration and should be promptly discontinued."

    "title": "Emergency Room Burden of Cardiac Complications in California.",
    "abstract": "Introduction San Bernardino County has higher age-adjusted death rates due to cardiovascular disease (CVD) and a higher ratio of patients to primary care physicians when compared to the rest of California. With these trends, it is important to consider the impact on emergency departments (EDs). This study examines the burden of cardiac complications on EDs in San Bernardino County and across California. Additionally, it examines the difference in cardiac-related ED burden between hospitals inside and outside of primary care shortage areas (PCSAs). Methods Data were obtained from the California Health and Human Services Open Data Portal. Baseline comparisons used the calculated averages and percentage of ED visits that were cardiac-related. Further analysis was done using independent samples t-tests on IBM SPSS Statistics 28.0.1.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY), checking for statistically significant differences in ED burden between PCSA and non-PCSA hospitals and between different geographical regions of California. Results Independent samples t-tests showed that rates of cardiac-related ED visits do not differ by PCSA designation in San Bernardino (p > 0.05), but they are significantly higher in PCSA hospitals when looking at Southern California and California (p < 0.05). Additionally, rates of cardiac-related ED visits seen in San Bernardino were significantly higher than in the rest of Southern California and California (p < 0.001). Conclusion Higher rates of cardiac-related ED visits in PCSAs of Southern California and California indicate a need to address issues of primary care access and enhance preventive measures for CVD. Furthermore, the increased ED burden of cardiac cases in San Bernardino County highlights the requirement for localized intervention."
