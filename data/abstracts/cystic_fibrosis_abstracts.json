    "abstract": "Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulator therapies have revolutionized the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) by targeting the underlying protein defect. Investigating how elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI) therapy affects interferon (IFN) signalling and inflammatory cytokine production in CF airway epithelial cells may clarify its role in alleviating the dysregulated innate immune response. Clinical efficacy was evaluated in 26 modulator-naive CF patients with at least one F508del mutation before and after 3 and 6 months of ETI treatment. Type I/III IFNs, IFNLR1, IFN-stimulated genes (ISG15, ISG56), interleukin 8 (IL-8) and IL-1β mRNA levels were analysed by RT real-time PCR in CF airway samples (n = 74). Patients showed significant improvements in pulmonary function (ppFEV1, 3 months: 12.5%, 6 months: 17.6%), BMI (3 months: 0.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, 6 months: 1.4 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), and sweat chloride (3 months: - 32.1 mEq/L, 6 months: - 44.4 mEq/L) compared to baseline (all p ≤ 0.001). The total number of exacerbations was also reduced (p = 0.002). Increased levels of IFNβ (p < 0.001) were found after 6 months of ETI therapy, whilst ISG15 and ISG56 decreased significantly (p = 0.022, p = 0.004). After 3 months, CF patients produced reduced levels of IL-8 and IL-1β (p = 0.001, p = 0.011) and even significantly lower levels after 6 months (p < 0.001, p < 0.001). ETI treatment appears to restore IFNβ expression and reduce levels of inflammatory genes (ISGs, IL-8 and IL-1β) in the airways, highlighting the potential of ETI to improve the dysregulated inflammatory status in CF."

    "title": "Evaluation of Cystic Fibrosis Newborn Screening and Follow-Up Process in Georgia (2022-2023).",
    "abstract": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a chronic, autosomal-recessive disorder caused by mutations in the CFTR gene, leading to thickened secretions that affect multiple organ systems. This study examines the effectiveness of Georgia's national CF screening program, which was initiated in 2012 and includes the measurement of immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT) levels at birth. An analysis of data from 2022 and 2023 revealed a decrease in follow-up attendance for sweat chloride testing among newborns with elevated IRT levels, from 59.9% to 51.2%. The birth prevalence of cystic fibrosis in Georgia varied, suggesting a need to improve both the accessibility of free testing and the quality of follow-up care. Identified barriers include limited access to screening results for pediatricians and the cost of follow-up tests. Recommendations include incorporating free sweat chloride and genetic testing into the national program, as well as improving community education and coordination with social agencies. The identification of 29 CFTR mutations in patients underscores the importance of continued genetic counseling. Overall, while the screening program shows promise, addressing these barriers is essential to improve outcomes and ensure the timely diagnosis and management of cystic fibrosis in Georgia."

    "title": "Development of a System to Deliver Inhalational Antibiotics to Marmosets.",
    "abstract": "Inhalational antibiotics have been used effectively to treat chronic diseases such as <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> infections associated with cystic fibrosis. This approach may enhance treatment options for difficult-to-treat, acute pneumonic diseases. Liposomal encapsulated ciprofloxacin (Lipoquin and/or Apulmiq) has provided protection in murine models of plague, anthrax, Q fever and tularemia. Development of the ability to deliver these drugs to nonhuman primates (NHPs) would enable further extrapolation of the data observed in small animal models of infection to humans. In this study, the methodology was established to deliver Apulmiq to common marmosets (<i>Callithrix jacchus</i>). Marmosets were anaesthetised with a novel, reversible anaesthetic comprising fentanyl, medetomidine and midazolam (FMM). They were placed into plethysmography tubes with their heads in an exposure chamber. The LC Sprint jet nebuliser or Pari eFlow Rapid nebuliser were used to aerosolise Apulmiq into the exposure chamber. Animals were euthanised after dosing and the concentration of ciprofloxacin was assessed in the plasma and lungs of the animals. Non-compartmental pharmacokinetic analysis determined that a 30 min exposure of drug was required to reach a human-equivalent target dose of 0.8 mg/kg body weight in the lungs. This approach can now be used to assess the efficacy of inhalational liposomal ciprofloxacin in NHP infection models."

    "abstract": "Poor sleep quality and excessive daytime sleepiness are commonly reported by individuals with cystic fibrosis. The potential impact of comorbid sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), particularly obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), has not been extensively studied in the CF population. At present, there are no specific recommendations available to help clinicians identify patients with CF who are at increased risk of sleep disorders. Home sleep apnea testing using a validated peripheral arterial tonometry (PAT) device may offer an accurate diagnosis of OSA in a more convenient and low-cost method than in-lab polysomnography. In this single-center study of 19 adults with CF, we found an increased prevalence of OSA among individuals with CF compared to general population estimates. Although associations with an FEV < 70% predicted and a modified Mallampati score ≥ 3 were observed, these odds ratios did not reach statistical significance, likely reflecting limited power in this small pilot sample. There was no association found between the self-reported presence of nocturnal cough or snoring and OSA. We also found no association between OSA and abnormal scores on commonly used, validated sleep questionnaires, suggesting that CF-specific scales may be needed for effective screening in the CF clinic."

    "title": "Transcriptomic profiling reveals RetS-mediated regulation of type VI secretion system and host cell responses in <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> infections.",
    "abstract": "<i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> is a major opportunistic pathogen that causes chronic infections, particularly in patients with cystic fibrosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The type VI secretion system (T6SS) is a primary virulence factor of <i>P. aeruginosa</i> in chronic infections. The objective of this study was to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms and pathogenic effects of the T6SS during <i>P. aeruginosa</i> infection, utilizing transcriptome sequencing and functional assays. We found that T6SS expression is elevated in <i>P. aeruginosa</i> isolated from chronically infected patients. Deletion of the <i>retS</i> gene activates <i>P. aeruginosa</i> PAO1 T6SS while repressing T3SS <i>in vitro</i>. Bacterial and cellular transcriptome sequencing analyses showed that T6SS genes were upregulated, while T3SS genes were downregulated in the Δ<i>retS</i> mutant. Additionally, the expression levels of the fimbriae gene <i>cupC</i>, the histidine phosphotransfer protein <i>hptC</i> (<i>PA0033</i>), and the transcription factor <i>PA0034</i> were significantly increased. Subsequent experiments revealed that adhesion mediated by <i>cupC</i> enhances the contact-killing activity of the T6SS. Deletion of the <i>hptC</i>-<i>PA0034</i> operon results in the down-regulation of <i>cupC</i> expression. The Δ<i>retS</i>Δ<i>cupC</i> and Δ<i>retS</i>Δ<i>hptC</i>-<i>PA0034</i> mutants exhibited reduced cytotoxicity compared to the Δ<i>retS</i> mutant, similar to the Δ<i>retS</i>Δ<i>clpV1</i>Δ<i>clpV2</i> mutant. The Δ<i>retS</i> infection increased cell death, inflammatory factors (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α), and reactive oxygen species compared to a T6SS-inactive strain. Importantly, our study demonstrates that the T6SS activates the PDE4C pathway in epithelial cells, leading to significant cellular alterations. The application of PDE inhibitors effectively mitigates cell damage and inflammatory responses. These findings highlight the critical role of T6SS in modulating host cell signaling and suggest potential therapeutic strategies for conditions associated with T6SS-mediated inflammation."

    "abstract": "Familial dysautonomia (FD) is characterized by skeletal morbidity, including osteoporosis and increased fracture risk. We aimed to assess bone mineral density (BMD) and trabecular bone score (TBS) in individuals with FD, and to explore correlations with disease severity. This retrospective study included all the patients with FD who performed at least one dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan at our institution during 2015-2023. Demographic and clinical data obtained from medical records included: medical treatment, anthropometric measurements, Functional Severity Scale (FuSS) score, balance assessment, the Brief Ataxia Rating Scale score, ambulation ability, blood test results and fracture history. Forty-one patients (21 males) had at least one DXA scan. The median age at the first scan was 25 years (range 7-47). The mean BMD Z-score was - 1.2 ± 1.5 at the lumbar spine and - 1.3 ± 1.1 at the bilateral proximal femur. The mean TBS Z-score was - 1.8 ± 1.6. The bilateral proximal femur BMD Z-score correlated with better scores of balance (r = 0.612, p = 0.001), ambulation (r = 0.627, p = 0.001) and ataxia (r = - 0.470, p = 0.015). For 67% of the patients, C-terminal telopeptides of type I collagen (CTX) was above the normal range for age. Both CTX and procollagen type I N-terminal propeptide (P1NP) correlated negatively with FuSS (r = - 0.515, p = 0.10 and r = - 0.619, p = 0.042, respectively) and with L<sub>1-4</sub> Z-scores (r = - 0.681, p = 0.03 and r = - 0.700, p = 0.02, respectively). Individuals with FD had low BMD and TBS Z-scores. These parameters were correlated to disease severity, specifically to balance and ambulation. The bone resorption marker was high and negatively correlated with disease severity."

    "abstract": "To adapt the supranational European Federation for Periodontology (EFP) S3-Level Clinical Practice Guideline for treatment of very severe periodontitis (stage IV) to a UK healthcare environment, considering views of a broad range of stakeholders, and patients. This UK version is based on the supranational EFP guideline published in the Journal of Clinical Periodontology. The source guideline was developed using the S3-level methodology, combining assessment of formal evidence from 13 systematic reviews with a moderated consensus process of a representative group of dental discipline stakeholders, accounting for health equality, environmental factors and clinical effectiveness. This guideline encompasses 47 clinical recommendations for the treatment of stage IV periodontitis, based on a step-wise process mapped to the 2018 periodontal and peri-implant diseases and conditions classification and UK classification implementation. The UK version was developed from the source guideline using a formal process called the GRADE ADOLOPMENT framework. The adoption allows (unmodified acceptance) adaptation (acceptance with modifications) and the de novo development of clinical recommendations. Using this framework and following the S3-process, the underlying evidence was updated and a representative guideline group of 101 delegates from 19 stakeholder organisations was assembled into three working groups. Following the formal S3-process, all clinical recommendations were formally assessed for their applicability to the UK and adoloped accordingly. Using the ADOLOPMENT protocol, a UK version of the EFP S3-level Stage IV clinical practice guideline was developed. This guideline delivers evidence- and consensus-based clinical recommendations of direct relevance to the UK dental community."

    "abstract": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) patients experience chronic lung inflammation and decline. Azithromycin (AZM), a macrolide antibiotic, offers potential anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial benefits. We aim to evaluate the safety and efficacy of AZM therapy in patients with CF. A comprehensive search was conducted across PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane on 22 December 2023. We included all relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cohort studies. Meta-analysis was conducted using R Studio software (version: 2023.12.1). Continuous outcomes were expressed as weighted mean differences with standard deviation (SD), and dichotomous variables were reported as relative risks with a 95% confidence interval (CI). A total of 18 studies comprising 2877 patients were included, with 11 studies meeting the criteria for inclusion in the meta-analysis. AZM significantly reduced the need for new oral antibiotics (RR = 0.77; 95% CI: [0.66, 0.89]). No significant increase in adverse events was observed. However, lung function (FEV1, FVC, FEF), inflammatory markers, and pulmonary exacerbations remained unchanged. Azithromycin holds promise for managing CF, but further research is needed to fully understand its long-term impact on lung health and resistance patterns."

    "abstract": "Tasty&Healthy (T&H) is a whole-food diet for Crohn's disease (CD), which excludes processed food, gluten, red meat, and dairy, without requiring formula or mandatory ingredients. TASTI-MM was a clinician-blinded, randomized-controlled trial comparing tolerability and effectiveness of T&H vs. exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN). Patients with biologic-naive mild-moderate CD aged 6-25 years were randomized to either T&H or EEN for 8 weeks, receiving weekly dietary support. Tolerability was evaluated by weekly interviews, questionnaires and intake diaries. Other outcomes included symptomatic remission, Mucosal-Inflammation Non-Invasive (MINI) index, calprotectin, C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Fecal microbiome was analyzed by metagenomics at baseline, week-4 and week-8. Data were analyzed by the intention-to-treat approach unless specified otherwise. Among 83 included patients (41 T&H, 42 EEN; mean age 14.5±3.7 years), 88% tolerated T&H vs. 52% for EEN (aOR 7.7 [95%CI 2.4-25]; p<0.001). Calprotectin, CRP and ESR decreased significantly in both groups, with no between-group differences. Symptomatic remission was achieved in 56% of T&H group vs. 38% of the EEN group (aOR 2.5 [0.98-6.3], p=0.1; per-protocol: 67% vs. 76%; p=0.47). Calprotectin <250μg/g was achieved in 34% vs. 33% (aOR 0.97 [0.37-2.6], p=0.84) and MINI<8 in 44% vs. 31% (aOR 1.8 [0.7-4.5]; p=0.33). Microbiome α-diversity improved in the T&H arm and declined in the EEN arm, showing superior species richness at both week-4 and week-8. Species associated with bowel inflammation, such as Ruminococcus gnavus, decreased in T&H and increased in EEN (q<0.001). T&H demonstrated better tolerability than EEN for inducing remission in mild-to-moderate CD, while positively affecting the microbiome (TASTI-MM, NCT#04239248)."

    "abstract": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) treatment has evolved significantly with the development of CFTR modulators, particularly elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI). This study aimed to evaluate in a real-life context, the efficacy, safety and tolerability of ETI in children and adolescents with CF at a national reference center in Brazil. A cohort of 39 patients (mean age: 11.7 years) who had been using ETI for at least three months were evaluated. Anthropometric data, pulmonary function, sweat chloride concentration, pulmonary exacerbations, antibiotic use, and liver function were assessed over a follow-up period of up to 17 months. Significant improvements were observed in weight Z-score at three months (p = 0.046) and six months (p = 0.018), as well as absolute weight gain (p < 0.001). Height showed absolute growth, but no significant changes in Z-scores. Sweat chloride concentration decreased by 52.8 mmol/L (p < 0.001). Pulmonary exacerbations and antibiotic use significantly declined (p < 0.001 for both). Despite limitations in spirometry data collection, FEV1 values showed a median increase of 6 percentage points. Oropharyngeal swab cultures for Pseudomonas aeruginosa positivity dropped from 43.6 % to 5.1 %. Safety assessments showed a transient rise in alkaline phosphatase (p = 0.011), but no significant hepatotoxicity. The most common adverse events were increased respiratory secretions (25.6 %) and abdominal pain (15.4 %). One temporary treatment suspension and one dose reduction occurred, but no patient required permanent discontinuation. ETI demonstrated effectiveness in improving weight gain, reducing pulmonary exacerbations, and significantly lowering sweat chloride concentration. The treatment was well-tolerated, with a favorable safety profile. These findings align with existing literature, supporting ETI's role as a transformative therapy in pediatric CF management."

    "abstract": "Despite recent revisions of Medicare coverage guidelines for continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in 2023, the policy change has been slow to disseminate to providers and patients. This quality improvement project aimed to increase CGM prescriptions and utilization amongst qualifying Medicare patients with diabetes on insulin. An interprofessional study team used process mapping to define the baseline state of CGM ordering and opportunities for improvement at a single diabetes specialty clinic. Several interventions were trialed through Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles, including general and targeted provider education, provider-facing technology support documents, a formulary guide, and patient-facing education about the new coverage requirements. The primary outcome was percentage of eligible patients using CGM. Process measures included the number of CGM orders started monthly. Demographic and socioeconomic factors in patients using and not using CGM were measured to assess for differences in prescribing practices. Over 8 months of intervention, the percentage of eligible Medicare patients using CGM increased from 49.6% to 62.6%. The median number of CGM orders started monthly increased from 34 to 60. Both pre- and postintervention, compared to patients not using CGM, patients using CGM were younger, had lower A1c, and were more often enrolled in the electronic health record patient portal. There were no differences in other demographic factors between the groups. Quality improvement interventions targeting providers and patients can help translate policy changes into clinical practice. Creating interventions with all patients in mind can prevent new differences in care as innovations are adopted."

    "abstract": "In this study, we present an innovative approach for tailoring treatment selection on an individualized basis in the presence of correlated multiple responses, particularly those measured on ordinal scales, including binary responses. Our methodology involves the utilization of rank lists for treatments, generated from probabilities of observing responses of higher order than each level of the ordinal outcome, conditional on patient covariate measurements. We introduce a rank aggregation technique designed to amalgamate multiple lists of ranks, allowing for correlations both within these lists and among elements within each list. Our approach is versatile, accommodating any number of treatments and responses, and is applicable across a wide range of models. Our method offers flexibility by allowing the integration of response weights, enabling customization based on patient and clinician preferences on an individual case basis for optimal treatment decisions. To evaluate the performance of our proposed method in finite samples, we conducted a simulation study. Furthermore, we provide two illustrative examples using data from clinical trials on Cystic Fibrosis and Alzheimer's Disease, demonstrating the application of our proposed procedure in real-world scenarios."

Measure development included cognitive testing with people with CF who participated in a pilot trial of CF-CBT, a CF-specific cognitive behavioral therapy skills-based intervention. Data were then collected from a baseline assessment in a multi-center randomized-controlled trial of CF-CBT for adults with mild symptoms of depression and/or anxiety (N = 60). Multitrait analysis was used to evaluate how individual CF-CSE items loaded on five hypothesized subscales, followed by assessment of subscale internal consistency and construct validity. Multitrait analysis supported retention of four subscales (21 items total; 4-7 items each) reflecting coping skill domains: Acceptance-Based Strategies/Self-Compassion, Cognitive Coping, Active Stress Management, and Coping with Daily Self-Care. Each scale had excellent internal consistency (Cronbach ⍺ = 0.81 to 0.90). Medium to large effect-size (ES) correlations were found for all CF-CSE subscales with self-reported Perceived Stress Scale scores, and medium to large ES correlations for all subscales with Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R) Emotional Functioning. There were medium ES correlations between the Coping with Daily Self-Care subscale and CFQ-R Social and Role Functioning and Health Perceptions. CF-CSE is a new CF-specific measure of coping self-efficacy with preliminary evidence of reliability and construct validity. It offers a promising strengths-based patient-reported outcome measure identifying targets for clinical intervention and evaluating outcomes in CF mental health care."

Multiple breath washout normalized phase III slope (SnIII) metrics may complement LCI when assessing lung disease; Scond describes convection-dependent inhomogeneity and Sacin reflects diffusion convection-interaction-dependent inhomogeneity respectively. We aim to determine the feasibility and utility of Scond and Sacin in preschool children with CF. We retrospectively assessed Scond and Sacin in successful MBW tests performed on preschool children. Scond and Sacin were calculated by visual breath-by-breath analysis according to ATS/ERS MBW consensus statement, with the exception that minimum SnIII was at least 30% of expired volume rather than between 65% and 95% of expired volume. We analyzed MBW tests for 40 healthy controls and 40 participants with CF, with a mean (range) baseline age of 4.1 years (2.6-5.9). Of the 372 successful MBW tests analyzed, 77% had reportable SnIII indices. Scond was elevated in CF relative to controls (∆ 0.037; 95% CI: 0.026-0.047; p < 0.001). Both within- and between-test variability was higher for Scond and Sacin than for LCI. More clinically stable test occasions were above the upper limit of normal for Scond than for LCI (64% vs. 50%, p = 0.02). MBW metrics Scond and Sacin are feasible in young children. While they differentiate preschool children with CF from healthy controls, SnIII indices are more variable than LCI, limiting their interpretability."

However, data on its sensitivity to detect lung function impairment in bronchiectasis across age groups remain limited. The aim of this study was therefore to determine the feasibility, validity and sensitivity of MBW compared with spirometry in people with bronchiectasis. We performed MBW and spirometry in 94 people with bronchiectasis (aged 0.2 to 79.3 years), 168 healthy controls, and 128 people with CF and 76 with asthma as disease controls. The overall success rate of MBW in all 466 participants was 96.1%. People with bronchiectasis had an elevated lung clearance index (LCI) and a reduced forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV<sub>1</sub>) compared with healthy controls and people with asthma (all p<0.001). Comparing bronchiectasis and CF, there was no difference in LCI, but FEV<sub>1</sub> was reduced in bronchiectasis (p=0.032). Within the bronchiectasis group, LCI correlated strongly with FEV<sub>1</sub> (r= -0.69, p<0.001). However, 34.3% of people with bronchiectasis presented with an elevated LCI but normal FEV<sub>1</sub>, while none had a reduced FEV<sub>1</sub> combined with a normal LCI (p<0.001). LCI was superior to FEV<sub>1</sub> in detecting lung function impairment in bronchiectasis (area under the curve: 0.95 <i>versus</i> 0.86). LCI is more sensitive than FEV<sub>1</sub> to detect lung function impairment in bronchiectasis.

We aimed to assess intra-individual variability in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV<sub>1</sub>) derived from spirometry to define the extent to which the observed changes were due to test variability in clinically stable PCD patients. PROVALF-PCD (Prospective Observational Multicentre Study on Variability of Lung Function in Stable PCD Patients) was a large international prospective cohort conducted in 2017-2019. We included patients aged ≥5 years who were clinically stable at two or more consecutive visits and provided spirometry-derived lung function measurements. To calculate the upper limit of normal (ULN), we fitted an unadjusted multilevel mixed-effect model, and to determine the absolute change in FEV<sub>1</sub> z-scores, we calculated the coefficient of repeatability (CR). We performed sensitivity analyses by stratifying relative change by age (adults <i>versus</i> children), number of measurements (at least four), and time between measurements (<4 months apart). We included 252 participants from 12 countries with confirmed or highly likely PCD. We included 1028 FEV<sub>1</sub> measurements from patients in stable state. The ULN for relative change between two measurements of FEV<sub>1</sub> was 25%. Test variability remained high in all sensitivity analyses. The CR was 1.88 FEV<sub>1</sub> z-score. Changes in intra-individual FEV<sub>1</sub> >25% between visits in stable PCD patients lie beyond the expected test variability and therefore could be considered physiologically relevant. These findings inform the selection of end-points for pulmonary intervention trials in PCD, as they suggest that FEV<sub>1</sub> is not a sensitive test for monitoring lung health in PCD."

Forced expiratory volume in 1 s, CASI, GINA, Paediatric Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire score, exacerbations, unscheduled medical attendance and hospital admission comparisons in patients treated with different biologics were adjusted by age, sex and biologic therapy duration. Among the 250 children (median age 13.2 years) recruited, 56.8% used omalizumab, 21.6% mepolizumab and 21.6% dupilumab. At enrolment, the dupilumab group was older (median 15.0 years), while the omalizumab group had been on biologic treatment the longest (median 622 days). Overall, 27% and 8% had partly controlled and uncontrolled asthma respectively, according to GINA. In the last 12 months, 52% and 29% had at least one and two exacerbations, respectively; airflow obstruction was found in 33%. 10% were admitted to hospital due to exacerbation. A previous switch from another biologic was recorded in 16%, predominantly due to nonresponse. Most children on biologics obtained good symptom control, but many still experienced asthma attacks. Switching between biologics was substantial. There is still an unmet need in severe paediatric asthma."

    "title": "Cholecalciferol (vitamin D3): efficacy, safety, and implications in public health.",
    "abstract": "Vitamin D₃ (cholecalciferol) is a fat-soluble secosteroid with essential roles in calcium-phosphorus metabolism, bone health, and an expanding range of extraskeletal processes. Upon synthesis in the skin via ultraviolet B exposure or ingestion from dietary sources, cholecalciferol is hydroxylated in the liver and kidneys to form its active metabolite, calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D), which exerts pleiotropic effects through vitamin D receptor (VDR)-mediated genomic and non-genomic pathways. This narrative review synthesizes evidence on the systemic effects of high-dose cholecalciferol on bone health, metabolism, cardiovascular and immune function, and its emerging roles in neurological, gastrointestinal, reproductive, oncologic, and psychiatric disorders. High-dose vitamin D₃ has demonstrated benefits in specific populations, including improved bone mineral density, immune homeostasis, glycemic control, and reduced inflammation. In patients with chronic kidney disease, cystic fibrosis, and inflammatory bowel disease, targeted supplementation has been associated with clinical improvements. Preclinical models support calcitriol's antiproliferative and neuroprotective functions, and its synergistic effects with chemotherapy, although large-scale randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have yielded mixed or inconclusive results, particularly in cancer, cardiovascular events, and cognitive decline. Methodological variability-such as inconsistent dosing regimens, baseline vitamin D status, and heterogeneous populations-limits definitive conclusions. While vitamin D supplementation is generally safe within recommended limits, excessive intake may cause hypercalcemia or nephrolithiasis, emphasizing the need for personalized strategies. Food fortification and targeted screening remain underutilized yet cost-effective public health interventions. Overall, vitamin D₃ represents a promising but complex therapeutic agent, necessitating further rigorously designed clinical trials to establish evidence-based guidelines for its use in diverse pathological conditions."

    "title": "Demonstrating Bioequivalence for a Lumacaftor Monosubstance Formulation Versus Orkambi<sup>®</sup> (Lumacaftor/Ivacaftor) in Healthy Subjects.",
    "abstract": "Lumacaftor is an active ingredient in the US Food and Drug Administration-approved combination medication Orkambi<sup>®</sup>, which is used for treating cystic fibrosis. Experimental evidence suggests that lumacaftor can be used as a monotherapy to improve brain perfusion and memory in heart failure. To clinically assess this therapeutic intervention, a formulation with demonstrated bioequivalence to the currently approved combination product is required. This comparative bioavailability and food-effect study compared lumacaftor pharmacokinetics in healthy patients following: (i) oral administration of lumacaftor (400 mg; Test Product) or Orkambi<sup>®</sup> (lumacaftor 400 mg/ivacaftor 250 mg; Reference Product) in the fed state and (ii) oral administration of lumacaftor (400 mg; Test Product) in the fasted to fed state. Plasma lumacaftor concentrations were measured with a standard liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry approach. The \"Test-to-Reference ratio\" of the geometric least-square means for maximum plasma concentration and area under the curve met the Food and Drug Administration-defined criteria for bioequivalence; median times to maximum plasma concentration values were not statistically different. The \"Fed to Fasted ratio\" of the geometric least-square means for maximum plasma concentration and area under the curve indicated a clear food effect on bioavailability. Lumacaftor exposure was approximately two times higher when administered with fatty foods than when taken in a fasting state. The monosubstance formulation was well tolerated. We conclude that the lumacaftor monosubstance formulation delivers lumacaftor exposure that is not meaningfully different than the currently approved combination product.

    "abstract": "Nonspecific gastrointestinal symptoms associated with cystic fibrosis (CF) may be misdiagnosed as food allergy (FA). There is a paucity of data regarding prevalence and phenotype of IgE-mediated FA in CF. We aimed to determine the prevalence and characteristics of pediatric FA in CF. We conducted a retrospective pediatric cohort study using the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Registries and electronic medical records from [redacted names A and B]. Demographic, biometric, and medical information were collected, and individuals suspected of having FA were identified through multiple inclusion criteria. A convincing FA diagnosis was established based on a priori criteria including medical history, testing results, and management. Estimated prevalence was calculated as a percentage and compared to the most recently reported pediatric FA prevalence in the United States (US). Among 289 patients (51.21% male, median age=12.40 years), 11 (3.81%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.91-6.71) had at least one convincing FA, yielding a smaller prevalence than the most recent estimate in the US pediatric population (7.60%, 95% CI 7.10-8.10, p=0.015). Male CF patients (6.08% versus 1.42%, p=0.038) and patients without pancreatic enzyme replacement (9.09% versus 2.25%, p=0.020) had higher prevalence of convincing FA. Our study of pediatric CF patients found a lower prevalence of FA compared to the general pediatric population in the US. Stringent criteria should be used when labeling CF patients with FA to minimize overdiagnosis. Further studies are needed to investigate if CF could potentially be protective against the development of FA."

    "abstract": "Non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are pulmonary pathogens with increasing incidence and prevalence worldwide, with people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF) traditionally considered at high risk of disease development. The imaging assessment of NTM-pulmonary disease (NTM-PD) relies heavily on high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT). However, due to lengthy treatment regimens and the need for long-term follow-up, serial HRCT's result in progressive exposure to ionizing radiation; a particular concern in younger people. We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients who had undergone serial thoracic magnetic resonance imaging (tMRI) scans to monitor NTM-PD as a novel tool to image the lung with a view to creating an algorithm for the utility of tMRI in the management of NTM-PD. Thirty-six patients, of which twenty-four had a diagnosis of CF, with suspected or confirmed NTM-PD underwent serial tMRI between 1st January 2013 and 30th June 2018. A total of 117 serial tMRI's were performed (mean number per patient 3.25; range 2-6). The associated clinical impact that each serial MRI had on management, deemed as the utility of tMRI, found that all tMRI's were classified as aiding management with 60 (51.3%) altering management. tMRI's were more likely to alter management in the non-CF cohort than the CF cohort (69.4% vs. 43.2%). No imaging-related adverse events were reported across the 117 tMRI's. This study highlights that tMRI may hold promise as a monitoring tool in NTM-PD and should be prospectively evaluated in the monitoring of individuals with NTM-PD."

    "title": "Optimizing synthetic cystic fibrosis sputum media for growth of non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae.",
    "abstract": "Non-typeable <i>Haemophilus influenzae</i> (NTHi) is an early pathogen isolated from the lungs of children with cystic fibrosis (CF). However, its role in the progression of CF lung infection is poorly understood. Additionally, whether it forms biofilms in the lungs of people with CF is an open question. The development of synthetic CF sputum media (SCFM) has given key insights into the microbiology of later CF pathogens, <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> and <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, through replicating the chemical composition of CF sputum. However, the growth of NTHi in these media has not previously been reported. We show that NTHi grows poorly in three variants of SCFM commonly used to induce <i>in vivo</i>-like growth of <i>P. aeruginosa</i> and <i>S. aureus</i> (SCFM1, SCFM2 and SCFM3). The addition of NAD and haemin to SCFM1 and SCFM2 promoted the planktonic growth and biofilm formation of both laboratory and clinical NTHi isolates, and we were able to develop a modified variant of SCFM2 that allows culture of NTHis. We show that NTHi cannot be identified in an established <i>ex vivo</i> model of CF infection, which uses SCFM and porcine bronchiolar tissue. This may in part be due to the presence of endogenous bacteria on the pig lung tissue, which outcompete NTHi, but the lack of selective agar to isolate NTHi from endogenous bacteria, and the fact that NTHi is an exclusively human pathogen, makes it hard to conclude that this is the case. Through spiking modified SCFM2 with filter-sterilized lung homogenate, biofilm growth of clinical NTHi isolates was enhanced. Our results highlight that there are crucial components present in the lung tissue, which NTHi require for growth, which are not present in any published variant of SCFM from the Palmer <i>et al.</i> Endres and Konstan in JAMA (2022;137:191-1) lineage. Our results may inform future modifications to SCFM recipes to truly mimic the environment of CF lung sputum and thus, to facilitate the study of a wide range of CF pathogens."

    "abstract": "<i>Burkholderia cepacia</i> complex (BCC) is a group of multi-drug resistant (MDR) pathogens that are challenging to treat, especially in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. Ceftazidime-avibactam is a promising antibiotic combination for treating BCC infections, but its efficacy requires further in vitro evaluation. This systematic review was conducted following the PRISMA guidelines to assess the in vitro susceptibility of BCC strains to ceftazidime-avibactam. We systematically searched PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Embase databases. Inclusion criteria required original articles reporting on BCC susceptibility to ceftazidime-avibactam using standard antimicrobial susceptibility testing methods. A total of 9 studies met the inclusion criteria. These studies were conducted between 2010 and 2024, with data from the USA, France, Germany, Belgium, and other countries. The studies used various methods, including agar dilution, broth microdilution, and disc diffusion. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) range for ceftazidime-avibactam was found to vary, with the combination showing significantly improved susceptibility compared to ceftazidime alone. This systematic review demonstrates that ceftazidime-avibactam significantly enhances the susceptibility of BCC strains, supporting its potential as an effective therapeutic option for BCC infections in CF patients. Further clinical studies are needed to confirm these findings and guide treatment strategies."

Odds ratios for dispensing were estimated using mixed-effects logistic regression. Airway therapies and oral/inhaled antibiotic use declined after ETI, whereas gastrointestinal and endocrine therapies remained stable. Elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor is associated with a reduced treatment burden in cystic fibrosis, supporting broader access."

    "abstract": "Solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients have a higher risk of developing invasive fungal infection (IFI). Isavuconazole is a novel broad-spectrum azole active against Aspergillus and Mucor. Isavuconazole is well tolerated, shows an excellent bioavailability and predictable pharmacokinetics, good diffusion to tissues, significantly reduced drug-drug interactions with immunosuppressive drugs in comparison with other broad-spectrum azoles, and few serious adverse effects, including hepatic toxicity. We have performed an extensive literature review concerning the clinical experience on the use of isavuconazole in SOT as prophylaxis and treatment of IFI, which included the SOTIS and the ISASOT studies, and fourteen published case reports. Clinical response, all-cause and invasive aspergillosis-attributable mortality in recipients treated with isavuconazole were similar to those described with voriconazole. Drug-drug interactions with immunosuppressive agents were manageable after the adjustment of tacrolimus and mTOR inhibitors. Isavuconazole showed fewer drug-related side effects and a smaller rate of premature discontinuation than voriconazole. In conclusion, isavuconazole appears to be a reasonable option for the treatment of IFI in SOT, and can be an alternative to voriconazole as antifungal prophylaxis in lung transplantation. Nonetheless, more clinical studies are needed."

    "abstract": "Deoxyribonucleases (DNases) are essential enzymes involved in DNA metabolism, playing critical roles in replication, repair, recombination, and the degradation of apoptotic DNA. They are primarily classified into two families: DNase I and DNase II, each exhibiting distinct catalytic properties and tissue-specific functions. Dysregulated DNase activity is implicated in various diseases. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the biochemical properties, gene structures, tissue distributions, and clinical significance of DNases. It explores their roles in disease mechanisms, the impact of genetic polymorphisms on enzyme activity, and their potential as biomarkers for early disease detection. While considerable progress has been made in elucidating the physiological functions of endogenous DNases, increasing attention is being directed toward the therapeutic applications of exogenous DNases. Beyond their established role in cystic fibrosis treatment, DNases show promise in addressing conditions such as cancer, acute kidney injury, sepsis, traumatic brain injury, and diabetic wound healing by modulating inflammation and clearing extracellular DNA. By providing a comprehensive overview of DNase families, this review highlights their functional diversity and clinical relevance, paving the way for future research, therapeutic advancements, and novel approaches to disease management. Therefore, this article contributes valuable insights not only to the field of legal medicine but also to broader areas of basic and clinical medical sciences."

    "abstract": "Fanconi anemia (FA) is caused by mutations affecting FANC genes involved in DNA repair, with nearly 20% of FA patients harboring nonsense mutations. Ataluren (PTC124) is a translational read-through-inducing drug (TRID) already approved in Europe that has a well-established safety profile even in pediatric patients. Amlexanox, an anti-inflammatory drug, also promotes read-through of premature stop codons caused by nonsense mutations. We compared ataluren and amlexanox in rescuing FANCA, FANCC and FANCF protein synthesis in lymphoblastoid cell lines and fibroblasts obtained from FA patients with nonsense mutations. While ataluren restored all FANC protein levels, amlexanox was partially effective only on FANCA. Notably, the rescue of FANC proteins resulted in a significant downregulation of p53. Moreover, unlike amlexanox, ataluren remarkably improved cell viability and reduced chromosomal aberrations upon exposure to genotoxic compounds. Amlexanox primarily reduced the signal transducer and activator of transcription 2 (STAT2) phosphorylation. Furthermore, FANCA-mutated fibroblasts exhibited a higher frequency of micronuclei formation as well as lower lamin B1 expression compared to their gene-edited counterpart re-expressing wild-type FANCA. Interestingly, ataluren significantly limited the generation of micronuclei in nonsense-mutated primary FANCC fibroblasts, restoring lamin B1 expression. This study represents a milestone of drug development for FA as it paves the way for clinical development of TRIDs, indicating ataluren as a promising approach to address the genetic instability and reduce the risk of malignant transformation in FA cells. Moreover, these results highlight the importance of a reliable experimental pipeline to assess whether minimal protein rescue via translational read-through can yield meaningful phenotypic rescue."

An observational multicentre study was performed on the reported CFTRm-exposed pregnancies with an expected delivery date between 2018 and 2023. We described prospective cases, defined as pregnancies for which the outcome was unknown and no adverse prenatal outcome was diagnosed at the time of first contact with the healthcare professional. Major congenital anomalies (MCA) were classified according to criteria of the European Registration of Congenital Anomalies and Twins. Fifty-eight pregnancies were included, mainly exposed to elezacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor throughout pregnancy (87.9 %).There were 53 live births, four spontaneous abortions and one medical abortion (fetus with cystic fibrosis). One atrial septal defect and one acrania/anencephaly were observed, resulting in a MCA prevalence of 3.4 % (IC95 %: 0.4- 11.9). There were three neonatal adverse outcomes without a clearly identified cause: one sudden massive alveolar hemorrhage, one delayed respiratory distress and one delayed transient hypotonia. No cataract was found in children who had an ophthalmological examination (n = 10). This prospective case series - the largest to date - does not suggest a high rate of MCA or neonatal adverse outcomes in CFTRm-exposed pregnancies. Further studies including long-term follow-up of in utero exposed children are needed to confirm these findings."

We aimed to describe the association between additional ADs and T1D-related physical and mental burden in adults. This was a cross-sectional analysis using data from the BEhaviors, Therapies, TEchnologies, and hypoglycemic Risk in T1D (BETTER) registry. Using patient reported-outcomes and validated questionnaires, we compared prevalence of vascular complications, hypoglycemia, and mental health issues between those with T1D alone (AD-) and T1D with additional AD (AD+). Among 3222 participants (66.2 % female, 42.7 ± 15.0 years), 36.3 % reported ≥ 1 AD+. The AD+ group was older (+4.4 years) and more female (+17.7 %) than the AD- group.

    "abstract": "Only a small number of antifungal therapies for invasive fungal disease (IFD) are currently available, and many pathogens are resistant to one or more of these therapies. Olorofim, the first orotomide antifungal agent to be developed, is active against fungi that are resistant to registered therapies. It impairs fungal pyrimidine biosynthesis, leading to cell death. We sought initial data on the efficacy and safety of olorofim as a therapy for IFD. In this single-arm, open-label, phase 2b study, patients aged 16 years or older with few or no treatment options for proven IFD or probable invasive pulmonary aspergillosis were recruited from 22 centres in 11 countries. The first 58 patients received a weight-based loading dose of oral olorofim 180-300 mg in two to three divided doses on day 1 followed by 120-240 mg daily in two to three divided doses from day 2 onwards. On the basis of pharmacokinetic data from the first 25 patients, dosing was simplified from patient 59 onwards to a loading dose of 150 mg twice on day 1 followed by a fixed maintenance dose of 90 mg twice a day up to day 84 (main treatment phase) with extended therapy as needed. The primary endpoint was global response rate (based on a composite of clinical, radiological, and mycological responses) at day 42, determined as success (complete or partial improvement in all three components) or failure (stable disease or progression on any one component or death from any cause) by a data review committee (DRC). Secondary efficacy endpoints included global response rate at day 84 and all-cause mortality at day 42 and day 84. Global response rate with stable disease classified as success and response rate in the clinical component of the global response at day 42 and day 84 were also assessed. Efficacy was analysed for all patients who were confirmed by the DRC to have an IFD and who received at least one dose of olorofim (the modified intention-to-treat population). Safety was analysed in all patients who received at least one dose of olorofim (the safety population). This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03583164, and is completed. Between June 6, 2018, and Sept 8, 2022, 204 patients were enrolled. Of these, 203 were treated with olorofim and 202 (124 male, 78 female) had DRC-adjudicated IFD. Causative pathogens were Aspergillus spp (n=101, including 22 azole-resistant strains), Lomentospora prolificans (n=26), Scedosporium spp (n=22), Coccidioides spp (n=41), and other fungi (n=12). Successful global response was confirmed in 58 of 202 patients (28·7%, 95% CI 22·6-35·5) at day 42 and in 55 patients (27·2%, 21·2-33·9) at day 84. Successful global response with stable disease included in the definition of success was seen in 152 patients (75·2%, 68·7-81·0) at day 42 and in 128 patients (63·4%, 56·3-70·0) at day 84. A successful clinical response was seen in 121 patients (59·9%, 52·8-66·7) at day 42 and in 109 patients (54·0%, 46·8-61·0) at day 84. All-cause mortality was documented in 24 patients (11·9%, 7·8-17·2) at day 42 and in 33 patients (16·3%, 11·5-22·2) at day 84. Mean dosing duration was 73 days (SD 25) for the 203 patients in the main treatment phase (median 84 days [range 2-99, IQR 78-87]) and 361 days (SD 220) for the 114 patients who received extended treatment after the main phase (median 309 days [38-988, 180-502]). Medically significant liver enzyme elevations adjudicated to be at least possibly due to olorofim occurred in 20 (10%) of 203 patients and were managed to resolution by dose modification in 14 (7%) patients or by discontinuation of treatment in six (3%). Gastrointestinal intolerance, which occurred in 20 (10%) patients, was predominantly reported as mild or moderate and self-limiting. There were no treatment-related deaths. Olorofim showed efficacy and good tolerability in patients with IFD with few or no treatment options. Further studies will be needed to fully delineate the role of this new antifungal agent. F2G."

    "abstract": "Rehabilitation has been shown to enhance patient performance before and after lung transplantation, but limited data exist on its role during the immediate post-transplant phase in critical care units. We conducted a single-center retrospective study. All adult patients who underwent bilateral transplantation for cystic fibrosis were included. Patients were followed from admission to discharge from critical care. All rehabilitation sessions were recorded. We aimed to evaluate the relationship between the amount of mobilization performed by the patient in critical care, and functional performance at discharge. We included 36 patients (21 males) with a median age of 29 years (IQR: 24.5-35.0) and a median critical care length of stay of 15 days (12.5-20). Patients performed a total of 388 sessions of rehabilitation. Out-of-bed mobilization started at a median of post-operative day 2.5 (IQR: 1.0-4.5), with the first walking session at day 3 (IQR: 2.0-4.5). A strong correlation was found between daily walking distance and functional performance, as measured by the 6-minute walk test, with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.70 (95 % CI: 0.48-0.84). After lung transplantation for cystic fibrosis, early initiated rehabilitation in critical care is feasible and can improve patients' functional performance. These findings are promising, but require validation in other lung transplant populations."

    "abstract": "Transplantation of airway basal stem cells could achieve a durable cure for genetic diseases of the airway, such as cystic fibrosis and primary ciliary dyskinesia. Recent work demonstrated the potential of primary- and pluripotent stem cell (PSC)-derived basal cells to efficiently engraft into the mouse trachea after injury. However, there are many hurdles to overcome in translating these approaches to humans including developing safe and efficient methods for delivery in larger animal models. We propose a model which targets preconditioning and cell-delivery to intrapulmonary airways utilizing a micro-bronchoscope for delivery. The detergent polidocanol was adapted for distal lung pre-conditioning, inducing intrapulmonary airway epithelial denudation by 5 and 24-hours post-delivery. While initial re-epithelialization of airways occurred later than tracheas, complete repair was observed within 7-days. Both PSC-derived and primary basal cells delivered via micro-bronchoscope post-polidocanol injury engrafted in tracheas and intrapulmonary airways, respectively. Transplanted cells differentiated into ciliated and secretory lineages while maintaining a population of basal cells. These findings demonstrate the utility of bronchoscopically targeted pre-conditioning and cell delivery to the conducting intra-pulmonary airways. Thus providing an important framework for pre-clinical translation of approaches for engineered airway epithelial regeneration."

    "title": "Gastrointestinal Burden in Patients with Pancreatic Insufficient Cystic Fibrosis Before and After Elexacaftor/Tezacaftor/Ivacaftor Use.",
    "abstract": "The advent of highly effective modulator therapies (HEMT), namely elexacaftor, tezacaftor and ivacaftor (ETI), has resulted in substantial improvements in lung function, growth, and quality of life, for people with cystic fibrosis (PwCF). However, the understanding of the impact of ETI on gastrointestinal (GI) disease burden is evolving. This study aims to describe and compare the prevalence of GI manifestations, prescribed GI medications, and GI procedures between two time periods pre and post-ETI approval in children with CF (CwCF). This is a retrospective cohort study utilizing TriNetX, a multicenter database. The study includes patients between 6 to 21 years old with ICD-10 diagnostic codes for CF and a prescription for pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) to match disease severity. We included 4 years before and 4 years after the release of ETI combination therapy. When comparing CwCF taking PERT, on or off ETI, the prevalence of diagnostic codes for chronic pancreatitis, constipation, unspecified noninfective gastroenteritis, and colitis significantly decreased after ETI use (all P < 0.0001). The prevalence of other luminal disorders, liver disorders, and acute pancreatitis did not differ between the two groups. The prevalence of prescribed medications including mucolytics, vitamins, PPI, and antidiarrheal was similar for both groups except for a reduction in prescribed laxatives (p-value = 0.0001). The prevalence of GI procedures was also similar in both groups. The reduction in constipation and non-infective gastroenteritis and colitis is important as GI symptoms are linked to the quality of life of CwCF. There remains a great clinical need to evaluate the effects of ETI on GI disorders, especially as the age of initial use of this therapy decreases, and the duration of use increases."

    "title": "Photoaffinity Ligand of Cystic Fibrosis Corrector VX-445 Identifies SCCPDH as an Off-Target.",
    "abstract": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) pharmacological correctors improve the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein trafficking and function. Several side effects of these correctors and adverse drug interactions have been reported, emphasizing the need to understand off-targets. We synthesized VU439, a functionalized photoaffinity ligand (PAL) of VX-445. Chemoproteomics analysis by mass spectrometry (MS) was used to identify cross-linked proteins in CF bronchial epithelial cells expressing F508del CFTR. We identified saccharopine dehydrogenase-like oxidoreductase (SCCPDH), an uncharacterized putative oxidoreductase, as a VX-445-specific off-target. We also characterized changes in the metabolomic profiles of cells overexpressing SCCPDH to determine the consequence of binding of VX-445 to SCCPDH. These data show dysregulation of amino acid metabolism and a potential inhibitory activity of VX-445 on SCCPDH. The identified off-target may explain the exacerbation of psychological symptoms observed in the clinic, thus emphasizing the need for further optimization of correctors."

    "title": "VLX600, an anticancer iron chelator, exerts antimicrobial effects on <i>Mycobacterium abscessus</i> infections.",
    "abstract": "<i>Mycobacterium abscessus</i> presents significant clinical challenges due to its intrinsic and acquired resistance to antibiotics, resulting in prolonged treatments and poor patient outcomes. Addressing the urgent need for novel therapeutics, this study explores the antimicrobial potential of VLX600, originally developed as an anticancer agent, against <i>M. abscessus</i>. Screening a library of 3,200 clinically evaluated compounds identified VLX600 as a potent antimicrobial with minimal cytotoxicity. VLX600 demonstrated inhibitory effects against various strains of <i>M. abscessus</i> with minimum inhibitory concentrations of 4 µg/mL-16 µg/mL. It also remained effective in intracellular <i>M. abscessus</i> in host cells and exhibited broad-spectrum activity against other bacterial species, including <i>Escherichia coli</i>, <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, and <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>. The antimicrobial activity of VLX600 was abrogated by supplemental iron, indicating a mechanism dependent on iron chelation. VLX600 significantly reduced bacterial burdens and inflammation in a murine model of pulmonary <i>M. abscessus</i> infection. Additionally, synergistic effects were observed when VLX600 was combined with conventional antibiotics such as amikacin and clarithromycin <i>in vitro</i>. These findings highlight VLX600 as a promising candidate for repurposing as an antimicrobial agent against <i>M. abscessus</i>, warranting further clinical investigations.IMPORTANCE<i>Mycobacterium abscessus</i> is an opportunistic pathogen that commonly causes pulmonary infections in cystic fibrosis patients. These infections are notoriously difficult to treat due to high levels of antibiotic resistance of <i>M. abscessus</i>, resulting in low cure rates. In this study, we identified a novel antibiotic candidate, VLX600, through high-throughput screening of 3,200 clinical compounds and demonstrated that VLX600 inhibits the growth of <i>M. abscessus</i> by depriving it of ferric and ferrous ions. This study highlights the potential of iron chelators as antimicrobial agents against <i>M. abscessus</i> infections. Since iron is an essential nutrient for the growth of many bacteria, the use of iron chelators could be extended to other infectious diseases. We hope this research will inspire further studies aimed at developing iron chelators as a novel class of antimicrobial agents."

    "title": "Real-World Improvements of Lung Clearance Index and Ventilation Distribution Efficiency in Children With Cystic Fibrosis After Elexacaftor/Tezacaftor/Ivacaftor Initiation.",
    "abstract": "Elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI) is a breakthrough therapy for cystic fibrosis (CF). We aimed to assess ETI's real-world impact on peripheral airway disease assessed as ventilation distribution inhomogeneity using nitrogen multiple breath washout (N<sub>2</sub>MBW) in children aged 6-17 years. Additionally, we compared the two outcomes, lung clearance index (LCI), and ventilation distribution efficiency (VDE), as VDE is considered to adjust for a theoretical overestimation of lung disease when using LCI. This nationwide study included data from N<sub>2</sub>MBW performed during routine clinical care. Linear mixed effect regression was used to assess changes in LCI and VDE after 12 months of ETI treatment. Subgroup analyses included baseline age (6-11 vs. 12-1 years) and disease severity (normal-moderate vs. severe-very severe). We included 131 children (78% homozygous for F508del mutation, mean [SD] age 11.5 [3.4]), and 339 N<sub>2</sub>MBW tests. The median (range) number of tests per child was 3 (1-10). The estimated mean (95% CI) 12-months post-ETI improvement in LCI and VDE were 1.7 units (-2.1; -1.2, p < 0.001) and 2.1%-point (1.6; 2.6, p < 0.001), respectively. Similar LCI and VDE improvements were observed across age groups. Using VDE, fewer children were categorized with very severe lung disease, and the ETI-effect did not differ between the severity groups, unlike LCI. Our research demonstrates that ETI treatment significantly improves lung function, as measured by N<sub>2</sub>MBW, in Danish children and adolescents with CF. VDE improvements were consistent across age and disease severity groups. In contrast, LCI revealed larger effect estimates for those with severe to very-severe lung impairment."

    "title": "An engineered glutamic acid tRNA for efficient suppression of pathogenic nonsense mutations.",
    "abstract": "Nonsense mutations that introduce premature termination codons (PTCs) into protein-coding genes are responsible for numerous genetic diseases; however, there are currently no effective treatment options for individuals affected by these mutations. One approach to combat nonsense-related diseases relies on the use of engineered suppressor transfer RNAs (sup-tRNAs) that facilitate translational stop codon readthrough, thereby restoring full-length protein synthesis. While several sup-tRNAs have shown promising results in preclinical models, many exhibit low PTC suppression efficiency, precluding their use as therapeutics. For example, glutamic acid (Glu) codons represent one of the most common sites for nonsense mutations, yet existing sup-tRNAs are ineffective at suppressing Glu-to-Stop mutations. To address this limitation, here we describe a rationally designed sup-tRNA (tRNAGluV13) with greatly improved ability to suppress PTCs occurring at Glu codons. We demonstrate that tRNAGluV13 efficiently restores protein synthesis from multiple nonsense-containing reporter genes, faithfully installing Glu in response to PTCs. Additionally, we demonstrate that tRNAGluV13 can functionally rescue pathogenic PTCs that cause hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome and cystic fibrosis. The ability of tRNAGluV13 to effectively suppress one of the most common PTC mutations should greatly expand the potential of sup-tRNA-based therapeutics."

    "title": "Corticosteroids modulate biofilm formation and virulence of <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>.",
    "abstract": "Corticosteroids are anti-inflammatory drugs commonly administered to patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis and similar lung pathologies, in which persistent infections with <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> are frequent. However, their therapeutic value is debatable because of their adverse impact on host immunity. The aim of this work was to determine the impact of budesonide and fluticasone propionate on <i>P. aeruginosa</i> biology. We found that these corticosteroids attenuated its intrinsic pro-inflammatory properties (reduction of IL-8 release compared to controls ca. 15 % (budesonide) and 50 % (fluticasone propionate)) and cellular invasiveness (25 % and 40 % respectively). Corticosteroids enhanced <i>P. aeruginosa</i> biofilm formation in a time/dose-dependent manner (around 1.6-fold for the highest concentration, with this increase occurring more readily in sputum media)) and stimulated the release of extracellular DNA (2-fold increase), a key component of the biofilm matrix. Regarding the mechanisms involved, our results suggest that corticosteroids diffuse through <i>P. aeruginosa</i>'s membrane influencing its fluidity and triggering cell envelope stress signalling pathways, as shown by an initial increase in <i>muc</i>A (σ<sup>22</sup> regulon) expression, outer membrane vesicle release and accumulation of cyclic diguanylate (c-di-GMP). Changes in the levels of this intracellular signalling molecule, responsible for the switch from planktonic to biofilm lifestyle, may explain some of the phenotypes observed. In conclusion, our data, first obtained with type strains and proved to be reproducible when using COPD clinical isolates, suggest that corticosteroids could mediate a faster acquisition of the phenotypic characteristics associated with <i>P. aeruginosa</i> long-term adaptation to the chronic lung niche without undergoing mutation."

Scientific software was used for segmenting the airway tree. Wall thickness (WT<sub>5-10</sub>) and the difference in median maximum airway wall attenuation (slope of the spectral attenuation curve) between 40 keV and 100 keV display energy were calculated and aggregated for subsegmental airway generations 5-10 (λHU<sub>5-10</sub>). Descriptive statistics, correlations, t-tests, and ANOVA analyses were performed. Arterial phase WT<sub>5-10</sub> was similarly increased in COVID-19 (1.70 ± 0.44 mm) and non-COVID-19 (1.64 ± 0.53 mm) pneumonia compared to controls (1.18 ± 0.34 mm, p < 0.001). Arterial phase λHU<sub>5-10</sub> was significantly higher in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia (3.09 ± 2.27 HU/keV) than in non-COVID-19 pneumonia (2.18 ± 1.54 HU/keV, p < 0.01) and lung-healthy controls (2.06 ± 1.11 HU/keV, p < 0.01). Spectral CT shows significant differences in segmental wall thickness and airway contrast enhancement between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 pneumonia and lung-healthy controls. Airway contrast enhancement may be a feasible measure to detect airway inflammation in pneumonia and neovascularization in COVID-19 pneumonia. Question Is spectral CT airway contrast enhancement a feasible quantitative method to detect airway inflammation or neovascularisation? Findings Spectral CT shows significant differences in segmental wall thickness and airway contrast enhancement between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 pneumonia, and lung-healthy controls. Clinical relevance Spectral CT can be used to assess inflammatory airway diseases such as cystic fibrosis, COPD, asthma and bronchiectasis."

In this article, we describe the development and structure of PRIDE CF, an innovative, large-scale epidemiologic study using a mixed-methods team science approach to understand the experiences and health outcomes of people with cystic fibrosis (PwCF) who identify as a gender or sexual minority. Our four separate but symbiotic projects utilize the PRIDE CF cohort (n ~ 300) with the shared goal of better understanding the needs of LGBTQIA+ PwCF. We use a fully decentralized study design to recruit a national group of participants from a small population within a small population and strive to protect participants' confidentiality and privacy. Results will inform intervention development and testing to improve health for this population. This study is the first to comprehensively investigate the long-term impact and experiences of LGBTQIA+ identity on a person with any chronic condition and, thus, can serve as a model for future collaborations outside of cystic fibrosis."

    "abstract": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive monogenic disorder caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (<i>CFTR</i>) gene, resulting in impaired <i>CFTR</i> protein function. Predominantly affecting Caucasians, CF involves multiple organ systems, including the lungs, pancreas, liver, gastrointestinal tract, and reproductive system. In contrast, CF remains rare among Asian populations, particularly within the Chinese demographic. Reported cases in China predominantly feature heterozygous <i>CFTR</i> mutations, with no confirmed instances of homozygous mutations. A 15-year-old male presented with a 6-year history of recurrent cough and purulent yellow-green sputum production, without hemoptysis. Whole exome sequencing identified a homozygous <i>CFTR</i> mutation, NM_000492.4:c.2290C>T (p.Arg764*), confirming the diagnosis of CF complicated by pulmonary infection. The patient received intravenous cefoperazone/sulbactam (2.25 g every 12 hours) and moxifloxacin (400 mg once daily). Symptomatic improvement was achieved after 2 weeks, and azithromycin was prescribed (three times weekly) upon discharge. This case highlights the importance of considering <i>CFTR</i> gene mutations in patients with prolonged respiratory symptoms (recurrent cough and sputum production) and imaging findings indicative of pulmonary CF. Whole exome sequencing is recommended to determine the genetic etiology in such cases and guide targeted management."

The primary objective was to identify the number of respondents who use an inhaled tobramycin protocol. The secondary objectives included the main indications, dosage regimens, monitoring parameters used, and administration details for inhaled tobramycin. A cross-sectional questionnaire was distributed to PPA members from March 28-May 22, 2023. Descriptive statistics were employed. The questionnaire was completed by respondents at 79 institutions; respondents at 61 institutions used inhaled tobramycin in PICUs (n = 45; 73.8%), NICUs (n = 36; 59.0%), and CICUs (n = 14; 23.0%). Most respondents (n = 73; 92.4%) in the 61 institutions that use inhaled tobramycin did not have an established protocol. The most common tobramycin product used was a tobramycin nebulization solution, and the most common indication was ventilator-associated tracheitis. Respondents noted the most common dosage regimen was 40 to 80 mg every 8 to 12 hours or 150 mg every 12 hours, regardless of patient age. Most respondents were unaware of the nebulizer used and the location of the nebulizer within the ventilator circuit. Additionally, the respondents noted that their intensive care units do not routinely check tobramycin serum concentrations. Most respondents did not have a standardized inhaled tobramycin protocol. There are variations in the dosage regimen, administration, and monitoring practices in critically ill children receiving inhaled tobramycin. Pediatric clinical pharmacists should work with interprofessional teams, including respiratory therapists and providers, to standardize the use of inhaled antibiotics."

    "abstract": "Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a severe genetic disorder caused by loss-of-function mutations in the CFTR gene. Gene editing approaches have the potential to correct such mutations. This systematic review outlines the mechanisms of the main CRISPR-based technologies, and, through cross-study comparisons, analyzes twenty-seven research articles that applied these technologies to target CF-causing variants. We report and discuss the strategy design, target cell selection, editing efficiency, prevalence of editing byproducts and levels of CFTR functional restoration achieved in each work, with the aim of providing technical insights for further exploration of CRISPR-based gene editing approaches. Our findings show that the F508del and W1282X mutations were the most extensively studied CF-causing variants, though over fifteen mutations were targeted overall. The majority of works under review explored the use of homology-directed repair (HDR) or base editing, with a growing number reporting efficient prime editing. Some studies tackled multiple individual mutations, compared different editors, or tested strategies across various models, while others focused on approaches that rescue CFTR function without directly correcting a mutation. Several works also proposed strategies that could address multiple variants with a single approach, while others highlighted technical difficulties in editing certain regions of the CFTR gene. This cross-study comparison also emphasizes the need for standardized reporting of editing efficiency and functional rescue, and stresses the importance of further single-cell RNA sequencing and in-vivo studies to reach clinically-relevant conclusions. However, as gene editing techniques continue to evolve, and with over sixty ongoing CRISPR-based clinical trials, there is growing optimism for meaningful advancements in CF gene-editing therapeutics."

With improved nutrition status in people on CFTR modulators, the emphasis on a high-energy, high-fat diet (the legacy CF diet) is declining, with an increased focus on a healthy diet. The increased survival and median predicted age of people with CF have created a need for more attention to metabolic diseases, including hypertension, dyslipidemia, and cardiovascular diseases. The effects of modulators on extrapulmonary manifestations associated with CF, such as CF-related diabetes, CF hepatobiliary involvement, gastrointestinal tract disorders, and pancreatic manifestations, are currently unknown. Approximately 95% of people with CF qualify for treatment with a CFTR modulator. This review discusses the basics of CFTR gene mutations and changes in nutrition status related to treatment with CFTR modulators."

Multiple breath washout (MBW) is an emerging pulmonary function test. Its main outcome, the lung clearance index (LCI), is a valuable sensitive measure in obstructive lung disease, especially in cystic fibrosis. The potential value of MBW as a monitoring tool for patients with PCD is not well known. This systematic review summarises all articles published by the end of 2022 reporting MBW data in patients with PCD and compares MBW parameters to spirometry and chest imaging findings. We searched PubMed, Embase and Scopus for original studies with MBW measurements in patients with PCD. 14 studies were included in the analysis with a total number of 398 patients. The mean/median LCI ranged from 7.98 to 11.8, whereas mean/median forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV<sub>1</sub>) z-score ranged from -1.98 to -0.5. The LCI was abnormally increased in all studies, whereas only two studies had abnormally decreased FEV<sub>1</sub> The LCI also had a stronger correlation with chest computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging results, compared to FEV<sub>1</sub> In conclusion, this review shows that the LCI is abnormally high in PCD from the preschool age up to adulthood. MBW appears to be more sensitive than spirometry in identifying pulmonary function impairment at the early stages of disease. These findings support the use of the LCI in daily clinical practice and provide evidence of using it as an outcome measure in upcoming clinical trials for patients with PCD."

To date, no studies have assessed the prevalence of psychosocial issues in adolescents with CF in Brazil. We sought to assess the prevalence of depression and anxiety in adolescents with CF in Brazil, as well as the impact of depression and anxiety on treatment adherence. This was a multicenter, prospective, observational, longitudinal study conducted between 2017 and 2019 at 14 CF referral centers in Brazil. We used standardized tools such as the nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire (for depression), the seven-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (for anxiety), and the eight-item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (for treatment adherence) in order to collect data on 218 CF patients at two different time points. The prevalence of depression was 19.1% at time point 1 and 15.4% at time point 2. The prevalence of anxiety was 19.1% at time point 1 and 18.0% at time point 2. Depression and anxiety were significantly higher in female patients and lower in those who underwent home physiotherapy or had psychological support. Significant correlations were found between depression and anxiety at both time points, the associations being strongest at time point 1 (r = 0.68; p < 0.001). Most (66.7%) of the study participants reported low adherence to treatment, and the remainder reported either average adherence (in 28%) or high adherence (in 5.3%). Depression and anxiety showed inverse correlations with treatment adherence. The prevalence of depression and anxiety in adolescents with CF in Brazil appears to be similar to that reported in other countries, being higher in females and lower in those undergoing home physiotherapy or receiving psychological care. Depression and anxiety appear to correlate with lower treatment adherence. Treating psychosocial issues may effectively improve rates of treatment adherence in adolescents with CF."

In CF, the small airways play a critical role, contributing to chronic symptoms such as cough, sputum production, and dyspnea. This was a single-center, retrospective observational study of adults with CF treated with ELX/TEZ/IVA for 12 months. We compared the patients who were homozygous for the F508del mutation of the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene with those who were heterozygous for that mutation, in terms of lung function outcomes (FEV1, FEF25-75%, and the RV/TLC ratio) and the extent of non-homogeneous ground-glass opacity. Among the patients within the cohort, the same parameters were evaluated separately in those who had advanced lung disease and in those who had previously undergone CFTR modulator therapy. There was a significant post-treatment improvement in lung function, with a median increase of 0.42 L/s in the FEF25-75% (p < 0.001) and a 5% reduction in the mean RV/TLC ratio (p < 0.001). There was a trend toward a higher improvement the F508del homozygous patients. A significant reduction in non-homogeneous ground-glass opacity was observed in 79.5% of the patients. Among the patients with advanced lung disease, there were notable post-treatment improvements in all of the parameters assessed. Our results highlight the positive impact that ELX/TEZ/IVA treatment can have on small airway function in patients with CF, with potential benefits even for those with advanced lung disease. Further research is needed in order to evaluate the long-term effects of this treatment and its relationship with patient-reported outcomes."

To develop a framework that groups clinical symptoms compatible with ICD-10 and DSM-5 according to their covariation and shared brain mechanisms. This diagnostic study was conducted in 2 samples, the population-based Reinforcement-Related Behaviour in Normal Brain Function and Psychopathology (IMAGEN) cohort (longitudinal assessments at 14, 19, and 23 years; study duration from March 2010 to the present) and the cross-diagnostic Brain Network Based Stratification of Mental Illness (STRATIFY)/Earlier Detection and Stratification of Eating Disorders and Comorbid Mental Illnesses (ESTRA) samples (study duration from October 2016 to September 2023). The samples are from 8 clinical research hospitals in Germany, the UK, France, and Ireland. For the population-based IMAGEN study, 794 of 1253 23-year-old participants had complete assessments including complete clinical assessments and neuroimaging data across all time points. For the cross-diagnostic STRATIFY/ESTRA samples, 209 of 485 participants aged 18 to 26 years had complete clinical and neuroimaging data. The sample included healthy control individuals and patients with alcohol use disorder, major depressive disorder, anorexia nervosa, and bulimia nervosa. Sparse generalized canonical correlation analysis was used to integrate diverse data from clinical symptoms and 7 brain imaging modalities. The prediction of symptom features was the main outcome.

One hundred eleven patients underwent 141 procedures with technical success achieved in 87.8% and clinical success in 84.8%. The most common causes of haemoptysis were aspergilloma (24.8%), bronchiectasis (19.1%) and malignancy (11.3%). Haemoptysis recurrence occurred in 65 cases (46%) with 20 patients undergoing repeat embolisation. Aspergillosis, cystic fibrosis, and non-tuberculous pneumonia were identified as risk factors for recurrent haemoptysis (p < 0.005). Pre-procedure MDCTA did not improve technical success. The rate of stroke in the cohort was 6.4% (9 cases), which is more so than quoted in the literature. Four of these patients presented with apical cavitations secondary to infection (aspergilloma or bacterial pneumonia). BAE is an effective endovascular treatment in patients with massive and recurrent haemoptysis. However, there is a well-documented risk of recurrent symptoms and early mortality, particularly in the setting of aspergilloma, cystic fibrosis and non-tuberculous pneumonia. The risk of stroke should not be underestimated. Patients should be counselled appropriately during informed consent prior to embarking on BAE."

    "title": "Molecular Advances in Cholestatic Liver Diseases.",
    "abstract": "The list of genetically defined causes of cholestatic liver diseases continues to expand; it currently includes mutations affecting bile acid synthesis, basolateral and apical membrane transporters, bile duct development, canalicular tight junctions, and bile acid conjugation, among others. The most frequently identified mutations in large multi-institutional studies of cholestasis occur in JAG1, ATP8B1, ABCB11, ABCB4, SERPINA1, and CFTR. Mutations in JAG1, SERPINA1, and CFTR cause Alagille syndrome, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, and cystic fibrosis, respectively. Mutations in ATP8B1, ABCB11, and ABCB4 cause a spectrum of diseases that range from the episodic, nonprogressive benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis and intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy to the severe and rapidly progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis. These cholestatic disorders present a wide range of symptoms and overlapping clinical features. However, in contemporary practice, diagnosis is often easily and rapidly established by clinically available comprehensive gene panels. In addition to diagnosis, these panels also aid in the discovery of novel genes or variants as potential causes of cholestasis. Genetic mutations may also be responsible for drug-induced cholestasis, as the liver plays a vital role in metabolism of drugs and xenobiotics. Uptake into hepatocytes and elimination into the bloodstream or bile of drugs and xenobiotics involve transporters across the basolateral and apical hepatocellular membranes, respectively. Therefore, mutations in any of the transporters lead to impaired metabolism and/or elimination of these substances. Furthermore, a large number of drugs and xenobiotics have a transcriptional or functional inhibitory effect on transporters such as BSEP and MDR3, setting the stage for the all-too-common drug-induced cholestasis."

    "abstract": "Growing evidence indicates that prematurity adversely affects lung function, even in early childhood, thus, a routine respiratory follow-up was implemented in our clinical setting. The aim of this study was to evaluate the acceptance of this examination and assess the feasibility of forced expiratory maneuvers and bronchodilator responsiveness test (BRT) in former preterm infants at preschool age and to present initial results. In November 2022, a respiratory follow-up was implemented for former preterm infants born at less than 32 weeks of gestation or with a birth weight below 1,500 g, who were born between 2016 and 2019 at Innsbruck Medical University Hospital. The evaluation included a standardized clinical examination, collection of medical history, spirometry, and a BRT. A total of 107 former preterm infants (median gestational age 29.9 (28.1; 31.1) weeks and mean birthweight 1,250.5 (±355.6) grams performed spirometry. Successful spirometry was achieved by 93 (86.9%) children. Among these, 64 (59.8%) had normal pulmonary function and were symptom-free, however, ten (15.6%) showed a positive BRT. Twenty-nine children (27.1%) exhibited pathological test results and/or respiratory symptoms, with 13 (44.8%) of them testing positive for bronchial hyper-responsiveness. Fourteen children (13.1%) did not meet the quality control criteria for spirometry but were symptom-free. Our study demonstrated that a respiratory follow-up for preterm infants is highly accepted and feasible at preschool age. Up to 30% of infants were identified with impaired lung function and subsequently received appropriate management, highlighting the importance of standardized and routine respiratory follow-up for these children."

Here we aimed to investigate the utility of our recently reported rat EVLP-to-LTx model as the smallest ever experimental survival model of EVLP-to-LTx and to compare late graft endpoints between strain combinations. We tested three strains as normothermic EVLP donors: Fisher 344 (F344), Lewis (LEW), and Wistar Kyoto (WKy) rats. Then we tested three strain combinations of EVLP-to-LTx (F344-to-WKy, F344-to-LEW, and LEW-to-LEW) to compare histologic and radiologic changes. F344 and LEW, but not WKy rat lungs, tolerated 4 hours of normothermic EVLP. F344-to-WKy EVLP-to-LTx developed significant histologic (as measured by acute lung injury score, ISHLT A and B grade rejection score) and radiologic (volume and mean Hounsfield units of aerated lung graft analyzed by computed tomography at day 7 after EVLP-to-LTx) changes in the lung allograft. In this strain combination, progressive deterioration with time was noted up to day 28, while F344-to-LEW grafts exhibited only mild injuries similar to LEW-to-LEW. In addition, flow cytometric analyses of F344-to-WKy EVLP-to-LTx revealed a sharp rise in activation marker expression in lung graft T cells beginning at day 3. Our F344-to-WKy EVLP-to-LTx model generates reproducible and clinically relevant histological, radiological, and immunological results similar to those seen in humans. The model is therefore well suited to experimental EVLP studies with long-term follow-up prior to moving to large animal and human studies."

    "abstract": "Attaining the Paris Agreement goal of limiting global temperature rise to below 1.5-2 °C requires the healthcare sector to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. This necessitates adopting diverse strategies, including replacing carbon-intensive metered-dose inhalers (MDIs) with more environmentally sustainable dry powder inhalers (DPIs) and soft mist inhalers (SMIs). While several European countries have successfully made this transition, patterns of MDI use and barriers to adopting sustainable alternatives in the United States remain poorly understood. Thus, we assessed inhaler utilization, costs, and insurance coverage among U.S. older adults. Using 100% fee-for-service Medicare data with pharmacy benefit (2008-2022), we described utilization trends and costs by device types and drug classes, including inhaled corticosteroids [ICS] and short-/long-acting beta-agonists [S/LABA]. Using the COVERAGE Search database, we extracted formulary data from Part D plans in 10 large US states and described insurance coverage, formulary tier placement (categorizing drugs by costs), prior authorization (requiring insurer approval for coverage), and step therapy (requiring initial trial of lower-cost drugs). Of 160,845,280 inhalers dispensed to 10,494,068 older adults (mean age 74 ± 7 years; 38% male; 85% White), 51% were MDIs. Of these MDIs, 88% were SABA and ICS. Median deductible-phase out-of-pocket costs were $3-9 for SABA MDIs vs. $42-49 for DPIs/SMIs and $3-4 for ICS MDIs vs. $3-116 for DPIs/SMIs. Only 18% and 50% of 2530 Part D plans covered SABA and ICS DPIs, respectively. Among the covering plans, >70% placed DPIs for SABA or ICS in higher-cost tiers, with 32-58% requiring prior authorization or step therapy. MDIs, primarily as SABA or ICS, accounted for over half of inhalers dispensed to US older adults. Most insurance plans excluded sustainable alternatives for SABA/ICS. When covered, additional approval steps and/or higher patient costs were posed. Multi-level efforts are needed to ensure affordable access to sustainable alternatives, as demonstrated in European countries. Funding for this study was provided by the National Institutes of Health and the National Institute on Aging (1R01AG060232-01A1)."

    "abstract": "Acute severe colitis (ASC) is a relatively frequent manifestation in children with ulcerative colitis and one of the few emergencies in paediatric gastroenterology. A standardized proactive approach based on tight monitoring and timely medical and surgical interventions may improve patients' outcomes. We aimed to update the previous ASC guidelines using detailed recommendations and practice points, based on a systematic review of the literature and consensus of experts. These guidelines update is a joint effort of the European Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition and the European Crohn's and Colitis Organization. A systematic search was performed in Pubmed Ovid Medline, Embase and Cochrane databases using 13 predefined PICO (patient, intervention, comparison, outcomes) based questions and 30 non-PICO based questions. Grading methodology was based on the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine-Levels of evidence. The questions were addressed by working subgroups following an iterative consensus voting process, including three online voting meetings and one face-to-face meeting. A total of 36 recommendations and 72 practice points were endorsed with a consensus rate of at least 88% for all statements, regarding initial evaluation, monitoring, medical and surgical treatment of ASC in children. Several topics have been revised since the previous 2018 guidelines and differ from corresponding published adult guidelines. These guidelines present a comprehensive overview of the management of ASC in children, offering practical recommendations and practice points aiming to standardize clinical and surgical treatment and improve outcomes of this severe scenario."

Over the past few decades, researchers have been working on gene therapies, and currently, terrible dreams have come true. To date, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved multiple gene therapies such as Kynamro for familial hypercholesterolaemia, Exondys51 for duchenne muscular dystrophy, Spinraza for spinal muscular atrophy, etc., rest for cancer, infectious diseases, and rare diseases. The authors have summarized recent advances in gene therapy, its background, molecular basis (e.g. viral and non-viral vectors), gene-editing techniques (e.g. CRISPR/Cas9, TALEN, ZFN), and its foremost applications in severe disorders, such as cancer, monogenic disorders (e.g. spinal muscular atrophy), polygenic disorders (e.g. autism), neurogenic disorders (e.g. Parkinson disease and Alzheimer's disease), and infectious diseases (e.g. HIV). In addition, we explored the major challenges faced by gene therapies during targeted delivery, immunogenicity, efficacy, and safety. To date, most of the promising approaches, such as different vectors, target cell populations, and both <i>in vivo</i> and <i>ex vivo</i> have paved the foundation for applications of gene therapies. Additionally, advances in enhancing the immune system that would certainly lower the healthcare costs.

    "abstract": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) affects over 100,000 people worldwide. Despite advances in CF care, sexual and reproductive health (SRH) care continues to lag behind other care priorities. Although partners of females with CF play a critical role in providing support and care, their perspectives of SRH care remain unexplored. During a mixed-methods study, interviews were conducted with 20 partners of females with CF, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using thematic analysis to determine SRH-related knowledge, experiences, preferences, and concerns. Findings indicate limited progression in CF-related SRH care. Patient-initiated discussions, paternalistic provider views, and a perceived lack of provider collaboration reinforce outdated notions that parenthood in CF is not an option. Partners provide tangible, daily support to reduce disease burden for females with CF and desire inclusion in the decision-making unit. Incorporating partners in SRH discussions and providing SRH-specific training for CF clinicians are imperative to improve patient-centered care."

There is paucity of data with similar improvement after initiation of elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI). In this cross-sectional study, we retrospectively reviewed the change in fecal elastase-1 (FE-1) at least 6 months after initiation of ETI in children less than 12 years of age. Children who demonstrated a change in FE-1 of ≥ 100 µg/g from the baseline after ETI therapy (post-ETI FE-1 minus pre-ETI FE-1) were termed as responders and those with a change in FE-1 < 100 µg/g post-ETI (or no change in FE-1) were termed as nonresponders. Thirty-five children had post-ETI FE-1 value at least 6 months after its initiation and were included for final review. The mean change (±SD) in FE-1 post-ETI from the baseline in the entire cohort was 47.2 ± 89.5. Seven children had a change in FE-1 of ≥ 100 µg/g or more post-ETI (responders). Two of these seven patients had a change in FE-1 of ≥ 200 µg/g post-ETI. Twenty-three had no change or change < 100 µg/g post-ETI (nonresponders). Another five children who did not have a baseline FE-1 and had post-ETI FE-1 < 10 µg/g were also added to the nonresponders cohort increasing the total number to 28. The pre- and post-ETI body mass index was significantly higher in the responder group compared to the nonresponders. In our cohort of 35 children, 7 (20%) were noted to have a positive change in FE-1 from the baseline value of ≥ 100 µg/g post-ETI. Further prospective multicenter studies will help identify predictive factors associated with improvement in FE-1 after initiation of CFTR-directed modulator therapies."

However, there is limited information on the safety of inhaled tobramycin in PwCF less than 1 year old and no studies primarily analyzing the safety of the 300 mg inhaled solution. The objective of this study was to compare the incidence of adverse drug events (ADE) of inhaled tobramycin in PwCF less than 1 year old to PwCF ages 1 year to 18 years old. This retrospective analysis evaluated the incidence of inhaled tobramycin ADEs in PwCF ages 14 days to 18 years with CF between January 01, 2008 to January 01, 2022. PwCF less than 1 year of age (infant group) were matched based on genotype in a 1:3 ratio with a PwCF at least a year old to 18 year-old (children group). Forty-eight patients were included (infant group: 12, children group: 36). Median (IQR) age was 0.48 years (0.2-0.7) and 4.7 years (2.3-10) in infant group and children group respectively (p < 0.05). There were 5 (41.7%) ADE in the infant group and 3 (8.3%) in the children group (p = 0.016). When cough was removed there was no significant difference between the two groups [2 (16.7%) vs. 1 (2.7%), p = 0.15]. There was no difference in treatment failure [3 (25%) vs. 7 (19.4%), p = 0.68]. This study found a higher incidence of inhaled tobramycin ADE in infants compared to children. These results show a low risk of ADE outside of cough, indicating that inhaled tobramycin may be safely used in this age group."

    "abstract": "For complex traits such as lung disease in Cystic Fibrosis (CF), Gene x Gene or Gene x Environment interactions can impact disease severity but these remain largely unknown. Unaccounted-for genetic interactions introduce a distributional shift in the quantitative trait across the genotypic groups. Joint location and scale tests, or full distributional differences across genotype groups can account for unknown genetic interactions and increase power for gene identification compared with the conventional association test. Here we propose a new joint location and scale test (JLS), a quantile regression-basd JLS (qJLS), that addresses previous limitations. Specifically, qJLS is free of distributional assumptions, thus applies to non-Gaussian traits; is as powerful as the existing JLS tests under Gaussian traits; and is computationally efficient for genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Our simulation studies, which model unknown genetic interactions, demonstrate that qJLS is robust to skewed and heavy-tailed error distributions and is as powerful as other JLS tests in the literature under normality. Without any unknown genetic interaction, qJLS shows a large increase in power with non-Gaussian traits over conventional association tests and is slightly less powerful under normality. We apply the qJLS method to the Canadian CF Gene Modifier Study (n = 1,997) and identified a genome-wide significant variant, rs9513900 on chromosome 13, that had not previously been reported to contribute to CF lung disease. qJLS provides a powerful alternative to conventional genetic association tests, where interactions may contribute to a quantitative trait."

However, limited data concerning the diagnostic impact of MDD on interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) are available. The objective of this prospective study was to assess the impact of MDD at a tertiary referral ILD center on diagnostic trajectories, prognosis, and identification of potential treatable traits in ILD management. This prospective study enrolled all consecutive adult ILD patients referred for MDD to a tertiary academic center in San Antonio, TX, USA from January 2017 to May 2020. The subjects were followed during a 3-year follow-up period after the MDD. Patients were stratified into three groups according to the pre-MDD diagnosis: unspecified ILD, IPF, and not IPF, and compared to the re-stratification post-MDD diagnosis into: unclassifiable ILD, IPF, and not IPF. The primary outcome was the percentage change in diagnostic trajectories after the MDD discussion. A total of 201 ILD patients (61.7% male; mean (DS) age: 67.2 (10.4) years) were included in the study. The total diagnostic trajectory change occurred in 122 (60.7%) patients. The diagnostic trajectories changed in 40 (46.5%) patients in the IPF group and 8 (19.5%) in the non-IPF group (<i>p</i>-value = 0.0003). Patients with pre-MDD unspecified-ILD were classified as not-IPF in 32.4% (<i>n</i> = 24), IPF in 23% (<i>n</i> = 17), and unclassifiable-ILD in 44.6% (<i>n</i> = 33) post-MDD. Considering the post-MDD diagnosis, differences in mortality were detected among the three groups (<i>p</i> = 0.037). Our results suggest that MDD has a significant impact not only on the diagnostic trajectories (DT) but also on the prognosis of patients with ILDs."

    "abstract": "RNA-protein interactions play a key role in the aberrant splicing of <i>CFTR</i> exon 9. Exon 9 skipping leads to the production of a nonfunctional chloride channel associated with severe forms of cystic fibrosis. The missplicing depends on TDP-43 binding to an extended UG-rich binding site upstream of <i>CFTR</i> exon 9 3' splicing site (3'ss) and is associated with concomitant hnRNP A1 recruitment. Although TDP-43 is the dominant inhibitor of exon 9 inclusion, the role of hnRNP A1, a protein with two RNA recognition motifs, remained unclear. In this work, we have studied the interaction between hnRNP A1 and the <i>CFTR</i> pre-mRNA using NMR spectroscopy and Isothermal Titration Calorimetry. The affinities are submicromolar, and Isothermal Titration Calorimetry data suggest complexes with a 1:1 stoichiometry. NMR titrations reveal that hnRNP A1 interacts with model <i>CTFR</i> 3'ss sequences in a fast exchange regime at the NMR timescale. Splicing assays finally show that this hnRNP A1 binding site represents a previously unknown exonic splicing silencer element. Together, our results shed light on the mechanism of aberrant <i>CFTR</i> exon 9 splicing."

It is estimated that more than 10 million individuals are heterozygous for a pathogenic CFTR gene variant in the US (heterozygotes). The phenotypic risk of these heterozygotes is not well defined, particularly among populations of predominantly non-European genetic ancestry. Understanding disease risk across each population can improve management strategies for all. To examine associations of diseases across the phenome with CFTR heterozygotes. The All of Us Research Program is a US-based ongoing longitudinal cohort study whose enrollment started nationally in 2018. In this genetic association study, whole-genome sequencing data were linked to electronic health records (EHRs) and surveys. Participants were 18 years and older. Similarity to genetic ancestral groups was genetically inferred using All of Us data and 2 large reference datasets, the 1000 Genomes Project and Human Genome Diversity Project. This analysis was conducted between February and April 2025. A single pathogenic CFTR variant. The main variables included clinical diagnoses documented in EHRs. Multivariable-adjusted phenome-wide association studies were performed. The main measures were odds ratios (ORs), indicating risk for a particular disease or condition. Overall, 363 pathogenic variants were identified in the cohort. Among 317 964 adult participants (55.7% female; mean [SD] last age in EHR, 56.1 [16.9] years), 7957 heterozygotes and 280 995 noncarriers were identified. Participants were followed up through EHRs with a mean (SD) follow-up of 12.4 (9.0) years. The genetically inferred ancestral distribution of the cohort was 18.0% African, 16.2% American or Admixed American, 2.1% East Asian, 53.4% European, 0.3% South Asian, and 0.4% West Asian. Frequencies of heterozygotes varied by groups of genetic similarity to reference populations: 3.62% in participants most genetically similar to a European reference population (n = 169 812), 1.35% in participants most genetically similar to an African reference population (n = 57 297), and 1.86% in participants most genetically similar to an Admixed American reference population (n = 51 483). A total of 2909 phenotypes were analyzed. No statistically significant associations were identified in heterozygotes of all populations combined or within each genetic ancestral group. Among 52 cystic fibrosis-associated diseases, although an elevated risk of respiratory diseases and infections was observed in some heterozygotes (allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis [OR, 2.50; 95% CI, 1.27-4.95]; bronchiectasis [OR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.00-1.47]; pneumonia due to Streptococcus pneumoniae [OR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.05-2.26]; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [OR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.05-1.24]; asthma [OR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.01-1.15]; and Pseudomonas infection [OR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.03-1.74]), effect sizes of these associations were several orders of magnitude lower than those found in homozygotes or predicted compound heterozygotes. In this genetic association study, most heterozygotes did not appear to have a substantially higher risk of cystic fibrosis-associated diseases during their adulthood compared to noncarriers. Additional studies are needed to investigate the underlying factors for the elevated risk of respiratory and infectious diseases in some heterozygotes."

    "abstract": "<i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> is an opportunistic pathogen that causes both acute and chronic infections, including pneumonia, bloodstream infections, urinary tract infections, and surgical site infections. It poses a significant threat to individuals with chronic lung conditions, particularly those with cystic fibrosis. Squalamine and claramine A1 have emerged as promising antibacterial compounds, exhibiting activity against a broad range of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Beyond their potent antibacterial properties, our findings reveal that sub-inhibitory concentrations of claramine A1 and squalamine can disperse pre-formed <i>P. aeruginosa</i> biofilm without impacting bacterial growth. While claramine A1, but not squalamine, enhances membrane fluidity, the structural difference between these compounds lies primarily in their spermine and spermidine moieties. Notably, we found that spermine, unlike spermidine, was able to both disperse biofilm and increase membrane fluidity. Together, our results suggest that while both compounds are effective at disrupting <i>P. aeruginosa</i> biofilm, they likely act through distinct mechanisms."

It is characterized by the buildup of thick, sticky mucus that can damage various body organs. The most commonly affected organs are the pancreas, liver, intestines, and lungs. Diabetes mellitus is a complex multi-system metabolic disorder. It is characterized by the relative or absolute insufficiency of insulin secretion with or without concomitant insulin resistance, leading to high blood sugar levels. One of the feared complications of CF is cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD). In this narrative review, we examine various treatment options, their mechanisms of action, their side effects, and their impact on the lives of patients with CFRD. In conclusion, insulin remains the cornerstone of treatment in the management of CFRD. However, oral medications for diabetes can also be considered safe and effective, in selected patients, with stable liver function and preserved lung capacity."

Age, sex, body mass index, smoking status, additional diseases, known etiologic factors, and vaccination status of the patients included in the retrospectively designed study were recorded as sociodemographic data. Respiratory functions, disease severity, and clinical outcomes of patients with bronchiectasis who did and did not receive inhaled anticholinergic and steroid treatments were compared. Ninety (61.6 %) of the 146 patients included in the study were women. The mean age was 56.14 ± 16.22 years. The etiology of bronchiectasis was unknown in 78 (53.4 %) patients. The most prevalent comorbidity was asthma. According to modified Reiff scoring, 91 (62.3 %) patients were classified as having mild bronchiectasis. Twenty-six (17.8 %) patients had airway obstruction. There were 93 (63.7 %) patients using inhaled corticosteroids and 32 (21.9 %) using inhaled anticholinergics. It was determined that patients using inhaler anticholinergics or inhaled steroids were in the more severe group. However, inhaler anticholinergic and inhaler steroid treatments had no effect on hospital admissions and exacerbation frequency in patients with bronchiectasis. Hospitalizations were more frequent among patients with bronchiectasis using inhaled steroids."

    "title": "Negotiating clinical practice guidelines: Doctors' experiences with implementing and rationing high-cost cystic fibrosis treatment.",
    "abstract": "In all societies, demand for healthcare exceeds available resources. When resources for healthcare are limited, clinicians inevitably engage in distributive decisions that affect the care of individual patients: so-called bedside rationing. Clinical practice guidelines intend to steer bedside rationing through transparent eligibility criteria. Still, the distributive challenge is exacerbated by increasingly available high-cost treatments for rare diseases, treatments entrenched in a great deal of uncertainty due to limited evidence of therapeutic effect. In this qualitative study, we investigated the real-life implementation of a clinical practice guideline for a costly cystic fibrosis treatment, elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (Kaftrio), reimbursed in Norway since 2022. Thereby, we provide empirical and theoretical contributions to the health economics literature on priority setting by drawing on policy enactment theory and the clinical decision-making literature. Using data from 18 in-depth interviews analysed by reflexive thematic analysis, we found that clinicians perceived Kaftrio to be exceptionally effective, making it very difficult to withdraw treatment in cases of uncertain or inadequate effect as suggested by the start-stop criteria intended to steer initiation and discontinuation of treatment. Clinicians enacted the guideline to deliver, not withhold treatment in cases of uncertain eligibility by shaping the guideline's meaning. Building on the empirical findings, we propose a model that theorises how clinicians negotiated the treatment's therapeutic effect across various axes of medical knowledge from observed to justified effects. In the era of high-cost genetic therapeutics, our study provides an important contribution to the understanding of tools and mechanisms to ensure fair and open priority setting."

    "title": "Preliminary proposals for the follow-up of infants born to mothers with cystic fibrosis treated with CFTR modulators during the first two years of life.",
    "abstract": "The number of pregnancies in women with cystic fibrosis (CF) has significantly increased in recent years, leading to a corresponding rise in the number of healthy infants exposed to cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator modulator (CFTRm) such as elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor (ETI) or Kaftrio/Kalydeco® (K/K) triple therapy. Currently, data on the immediate outcomes for these children is reassuring; however, some cases of abnormal liver tests and cataracts have been reported in a few newborns indirectly exposed to ETI in utero or postnatally. Long-term neurodevelopment remains a concern that requires further investigation. A working group from the Société Française de la Mucoviscidose has developed recommendations for monitoring these children during the first two years and beyond. Given the increasing number of infants born to mothers taking CFTR modulators, as well as questions regarding their immediate care during the maternity stay and the feasibility of breastfeeding, it is crucial for pediatricians to be aware of these recommendations, which are based on a comprehensive review of the literature."

    "title": "A descriptive cohort study of pregnancy and parenthood in women with cystic fibrosis.",
    "abstract": "Women with cystic fibrosis (wwCF) are increasingly undertaking pregnancy. This study assessed the current state of relationships, fertility, pregnancy and parenthood in a total cohort of 217 wwCF. Overall, 64% of wwCF were in long-term heterosexual relationships, 32% were single and 4% were in same-sex relationships; 64 wwCF had 111 children; 97 (87.4%) were conceived naturally and 10 (9%) by assisted reproduction. One woman had two children by surrogacy, one couple adopted a child and 6 had a role as a step-parent. Of the 217 wwCF 31 (14%) died at a mean age of 41.4 years; they had 18 children and 8 (44%) were less than 18 years old when the mother died. There was a marked increase in pregnancies associated with the introduction of CF modulator medications, from 3 in 2020 to 16 in 2023. There were 50 pregnancies between 2020 and 2024;17 (34%) were not planned (5 were terminated); and 15 (30%) partners did not have CF genetic tests pre-conception. There were 8 miscarriages. Exacerbations of lung disease occurred in 11 (31%) completed pregnancies, gestational diabetes in 12 (34%), one gastrointestinal bleeding, and one pre-eclampsia. Delivery was by caesarean section in 14 (40%) and 4 (11%) births were pre-mature (<37 weeks gestation). Although outcomes are generally good, pre-conception planning is suboptimal, pregnancy is associated with increased complications and parenthood raises complex issues regarding prognosis. CF teams should have close links with maternal medicine services to meet the specific needs of wwCF."

    "abstract": "People with cystic fibrosis (pwCF) have reduced mucociliary clearance in their airways, leading to the build-up of thick, sticky mucus susceptible to opportunistic infection. A new treatment, comprised of three small molecule drugs called Elexacaftor/Tezacaftor/Ivacaftor (ETI), has improved mucociliary clearance and lung function in pwCF, but how this therapy alters lung infections is poorly understood. This study experimentally modeled the biochemical changes in airway mucus caused by ETI to determine its effect on the CF lung microbiome structure and function. We prepared Artificial Sputum Medium (ASM) with reduced primary carbon sources (amino acids, deoxyribonucleic acid DNA, and mucin) to mimic the effects of ETI on mucus biochemistry due to improved mucociliary clearance and reduced pulmonary inflammation. The control and modified ASM were inoculated with pure CF pathogens or mixed-species communities and then grown in oxic and anoxic conditions, followed by multi-omics data analysis. Although oxygen strongly altered the community structure, the nutrient depletions in ASM had little effect. Instead, the reduced carbon sources altered the physiology of the collective community and its individual pathogens. This included modified growth kinetics in addition to altered nitrogen and nucleotide metabolism. Under reduced amino acid concentrations, a known effect of ETI on the sputum metabolome, the production of both Pseudomonas aeruginosa's quinolones and rhamnolipids was significantly reduced. This indirect effect of ETI translates to reduced killing of competing pathogens and reduced toxicity to epithelial cells isolated from the airways of explanted human lung tissues. These findings indicate that ETI may provide further benefit to pwCF by reducing the competition and virulence of its principal pathogen and highlight how microenvironmental effects can have powerful impacts on polymicrobial infections."

    "abstract": "Inhaled steroids dose reduction is a relevant goal in severe asthma management. We aimed to investigate ICS use trajectories and their clinical impact in severe asthma patients on benralizumab over 36 months. We conducted a retrospective real-life observational study including clinical and inflammatory parameters. Patients were stratified according to ICS dose trends over time: \"stable\" (same dose at ≥80 % of visits), \"decreasing\" (≥50 % of visits with lower ICS dose vs baseline), and \"increasing\" (≥50 % of visits with higher ICS dose vs baseline). 92 patients were included. Post-bronchodilation FEV<sub>1</sub> significantly increased over 36 months, while pre-bronchodilation FEV<sub>1</sub> remained stable. An overall statistically significant improvement was observed also for ACT, ACQ, AQLQ and annual exacerbation rate. The probability of decreasing ICS dose was 19.0 % at 12 months and 37.4 % at 36 months. In the decreasing group (30 % of the cohort), baseline blood eosinophil count (BEC) was higher than in the stable group, and BEC suppression over time was greater. The decreasing group was also less frequently treated with OCS at baseline. At 24 months, the stable group showed a greater reduction in OCS use compared to the decreasing group. Across all groups, OCS use dropped from 89.8 % to 4.9 % at 36 months. The findings suggest that ICS tapering is feasible and safe in selected patients under benralizumab therapy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first real-life study specifically supporting the ICS-sparing effect of benralizumab over a 36-month period."

    "abstract": "Data on the genomics of <i>Porphyromonas</i> species other than <i>Porphyromonas gingivalis</i> (POTG), particularly within pulmonary environments, are scarce. In this study, we conducted whole-genome sequencing on pulmonary isolates of POTG, specifically <i>Porphyromonas catoniae</i> (<i>n</i>=3), <i>Porphyromonas pasteri</i> (<i>n</i>=1) and <i>Porphyromonas uenonis</i> (<i>n</i>=2), from people with cystic fibrosis. These genomic analyses were complemented with antimicrobial susceptibility tests for these strains. We compared the genomic sequences of these pulmonary isolates with those of previously characterized <i>Porphyromonas</i> species. Our study revealed a distinct clade differentiation between non-pigmented and pigmented <i>Porphyromonas</i> species. Unlike <i>P. gingivalis</i>, the pulmonary POTG strains lacked known virulence genes, with the exception of a putative haemolysin gene. Regarding antibiotic resistance, notable resistances were limited to vancomycin in <i>P. catoniae</i> and clindamycin in <i>P. uenonis</i>. These findings support the hypothesis that POTG species may predominantly behave as commensals in the lung environment rather than as pathogens."

    "abstract": "Mouse models of cystic fibrosis (CF) have been used to study chronic lung infections; however, these models have lacked the airway mucus that defines human CF pathophysiology and required the use of mucoid <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>. Alternative models have used either transgenic <i>Scnn1b-Tg</i> mice overexpressing a lung epithelial sodium channel to mimic the mucus-rich CF lung environment, synthetic CF sputum medium (SCFM2) to induce bacterial phenotypes consistent with human CF, or agar beads to promote chronic infections by non-mucoid <i>P. aeruginosa</i>. Here, we combined these alternative models and established a chronic <i>P. aeruginosa</i> lung infection model using SCFM2 agar beads and <i>Scnn1b-</i>Tg mice (SCFM2-<i>Scnn1b-</i>Tg) to recapitulate nutrient and mucus characteristics of the human CF lung environment and test the effects of chronic infections on bacterial burden, lung function, and the immune response. Using wild-type SCFM2-C57BL/6 mice as controls, SCFM2-<i>Scnn1b-</i>Tg mice failed to clear bacterial infections, and lung function measurements showed that infected SCFM2-<i>Scnn1b-</i>Tg mice had decreased inspiratory capacity and compliance, elevated airway resistance, and significantly reduced forced expiratory volumes. Flow cytometry and cytokine arrays showed that, like people with CF, SCFM2-<i>Scnn1b-</i>Tg mice developed inflammation characterized by neutrophil and eosinophil infiltration and Th2 lymphocytic cytokine responses. Chronically infected SCFM2-<i>Scnn1b-</i>Tg mice developed an exacerbated mix of innate and Th1, Th2, and Th17-mediated inflammation, causing higher lung cellular damage and elevated numbers of unusual Siglec F<sup>+</sup> neutrophils. SCFM2-<i>Scnn1b-</i>Tg mice will be useful for investigating bacterial pathogenesis by non-mucoid <i>P. aeruginosa</i>, including treatments and the roles of Siglec F<sup>+</sup> neutrophils in CF inflammation."

    "abstract": "The clinical effectiveness of tezacaftor-ivacaftor in children with cystic fibrosis (cwCF) varies; some patients respond while others do not or have adverse effects. The pharmacokinetics (PK) of tezacaftor-ivacaftor are inadequately published, especially in children. Knowledge of the PK in this cohort in relation to clinical outcomes may give further insight into the drug's exposure-response relationship and its associated interindividual variability. The aim of this study was to assess the real-world PK of tezacaftor-ivacaftor in cwCF. A prospective, observational PK study was performed in cwCF using tezacaftor-ivacaftor. PK samples were obtained by dried blood spots at home and during routine outpatient hospital visits. Population PK (popPK) models were created using nonlinear mixed-effects modelling. Due to data scarcity, prior information from adolescent/adult PK models was required. The study involved 21 children (age 6-17 years, weight 24-70 kg). Novel popPK models were created for tezacaftor-ivacaftor and its main metabolites. Variability in PK was explained by variation in body weight. The area under the curve of tezacaftor-ivacaftor varied significantly within and across age groups, which corresponded to the reported area under the curve in the product information. Maximum concentration and elimination half-lives closely matched adult reported values. This is the first study to investigate the popPK of tezacaftor-ivacaftor in cwCF. The established models can be used for more personalized dosing in children experiencing suboptimal efficacy, adverse effects, drug-drug interactions, or where adherence is a concern."

    "abstract": "The F508del CFTR gene mutation primarily leads to cystic fibrosis development yet produces infertility complications in males. The presented case concerns a 32-year-old man who has azoospermia but does not display cystic fibrosis symptoms. Testing showed the presence of the F508del CFTR mutation, which resulted in identifying obstructive azoospermia with congenital absence of the vas deferens (CAVD). The woman suffered from inadequate ovarian function. Fertility solutions for couples can be obtained through assisted reproductive methods which include testicular sperm extraction (TESE) along with percutaneous epididymal sperm aspiration (PESA) that utilizes intracytoplasmic sperm injection techniques (ICSI). Genetic counseling remains essential for risk assessment because it tells family members if they carry this genetic defect. The assessment matters more when women also have the genetic defect. The research confirms how CFTR mutations affect infertility while demonstrating the need for early genetic screening to properly manage male infertility with unknown causes."

Our study aimed to investigate the role of major mutations modulating A1AT levels in several lung pathologies and control groups. Blood samples were collected from healthy non-smokers (N<sup>0</sup> = 85), healthy smokers (N<sup>0</sup> = 291), healthy ex-smokers (N<sup>0</sup> = 127), smokers with chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD, N<sup>0</sup> = 187), ex-smokers with COPD (N<sup>0</sup> = 64), and patients with asthma (N<sup>0</sup> = 194), interstitial lung disease (ILD) (N<sup>0</sup> = 93), sarcoidosis (N<sup>0</sup> = 30) and cystic fibrosis (N<sup>0</sup> = 26). Clinical and respiratory parameters, A1AT levels, the extent of emphysema and comorbidities on low-dose CT scans were evaluated, and patients answered a smoking history and comorbidity questionnaire. A1AT single-nucleotide polymorphisms were determined for the S, Z, M2/M4, 0 and eQTL locations by SNP probes using real-time PCR. A1AT levels showed significant differences between cigarette smoke-induced and other lung diseases. Compared to controls, A1AT levels were found to be lower in sarcoidosis and increasingly higher in smokers and patients with COPD, ILD and CF, respectively. The presence and pattern of emphysema were found to influence A1AT levels: lower values were observed in COPD patients without emphysema, while higher values were observed in patients with central and panlobular emphysema. Antitrypsin levels increased with COPD GOLD stages and asthma GINA stages. Variable A1AT levels were also found in ILD subgroups. The distribution of variants at the S, Z, M2/M4 and 0 polymorphic sites and the eQTL location showed no significant differences between patient groups with impaired lung function, except for Z heterozygotes, which were prevalent in patients with severe asthma. The eQTL TT genotypes had higher A1AT levels and the occurrence of emphysema and/or bronchitis was increased. A1AT levels correlated with several clinical and respiratory parameters in pulmonary patients, while FEV1/FVC inversely correlated with levels of A1AT. Molar antielastase activity was increased in smokers and patients with lung diseases; however, in COPD, antielastase activity decreased. The most reduced antielastase activity could be found in CF. Certain genotypes were characterized by increased cardiovascular comorbidity scores and antitrypsin levels. Our data suggest that in addition to emphysema, A1AT may play an important role in the development of a wide variety of lung diseases and cardiovascular comorbidities. Further research is needed to clarify the role of A1AT and its regulation in lung pathologies."

    "abstract": "Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a common genetic disease in the United States, resulting from mutations in the <i>Cystic Fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (cftr)</i> gene. CFTR modulators, particularly Elexacaftor/Tezacaftor/Ivacaftor (ETI), have significantly improved clinical outcomes for patients with CF. However, many CFTR mutations are not eligible for CFTR modulator therapy due to their rarity. In this study, we report that a patient carrying rare complex CFTR mutations, c.1680-877G>T and c.3067_3072delATAGTG, showed positive clinical outcomes after ETI treatment. We demonstrate that ETI was able to increase the expression of CFTR harboring c.3067_3072delATAGTG in a heterologous system. Importantly, patient-derived nasal epithelial cells in an air-liquid interface (ALI) culture showed improved CFTR function following ETI treatment. These findings supported the initiation of ETI with the patient. Retrospective studies have suggested that the patient has shown small but steady improvement over the past two years in several clinical metrics, including lung function, body mass index (BMI), and sweat chloride levels. Our studies suggest that ETI could be beneficial for patients carrying c.3067_3072delATAGTG."

Real-world evidence, particularly from national and international CF registries, is essential to assess their long-term effectiveness and safety. We reviewed published studies using registry data to evaluate the impact of CFTRms on clinical outcomes in individuals with CF. A narrative review of studies published between 2015 and 2025 was conducted, focusing on registry-based evaluations of ivacaftor, lumacaftor/ivacaftor, tezacaftor/ivacaftor, and elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor. Primary outcomes included lung function, pulmonary exacerbations, nutritional status, and survival. Fifty-seven registry-based studies confirmed the benefits of CFTRms across diverse CF populations. Ivacaftor has demonstrated sustained improvements in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>), reduced exacerbations, and improved nutritional outcomes. Lumacaftor/ivacaftor and tezacaftor/ivacaftor have shown modest benefits, especially in homozygous F508del patients. The introduction of elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor has led to unprecedented improvements in lung function and quality of life, along with a reduced need for lung transplantation. Methodological heterogeneity and incomplete data remain challenges. Registry data provide essential, complementary evidence to clinical trials and support the effectiveness of CFTRms in routine care. Continued efforts are needed to harmonize registry methodologies and outcome measures."

    "abstract": "<b>Background/Objectives:</b> Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a multisystem disease caused by CFTR gene variants, with a high prevalence of vitamin D (VitD) deficiency despite the supplementation and schedules specifically developed for this population. Lower VitD levels have been associated with an increased risk of respiratory infections and pulmonary exacerbations in CF, with some pilot studies indicating the potential benefits of supplementation during acute episodes. This study aimed to describe the occurrence of VitD deficiency according to the supplemented dose in pediatric patients with CF. <b>Methods</b>: A cross-sectional analytical study was conducted to assess serum VitD levels in a pediatric population with cystic fibrosis. Clinical and biochemical data were collected, along with information on VitD intake and pancreatic enzyme dosage at the time of evaluation. <b>Results</b>: A total of 48 patients were included in the study. Normal VitD levels were observed in 41.7% of the patients, insufficiency in 31.3%, and deficiency in 27%. The median VitD intake was 2050 IU. A statistically significant difference was observed in patients with a daily intake exceeding 2000 IU. Only 10% of patients achieved levels above 30 ng/mL with a lower dose. No statistically significant association was identified between the pancreatic enzyme dosage and vitamin D levels. <b>Conclusions:</b> Vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency is a persistent problem in the pediatric CF population; the interventions targeting factors associated with this condition are required to refine supplementation schedules. These findings underscore the need for personalized strategies to optimize vitamin D status in PwCF. Ideally, these strategies should consider all associated factors, including genetic variants; however, with limited resources, our results suggest that a daily dose of 2000 IU of vitamin D may represent a reasonable and effective starting point for supplementation."

    "abstract": "People with a rare disease find it difficult to obtain a diagnosis and access appropriate services. Evidence suggests that this can lead to health inequity amongst the rare disease community, i.e. systemic, unfair and avoidable differences in health opportunities and outcomes. This scoping review aims to identify and describe evidence on health inequities experienced by the rare disease community with regards to receipt of a diagnosis and access to health and social care services. We searched ASSIA, CINAHL, Embase, HMIC, MEDLINE and Social Policy and Practice for relevant studies. Studies were double screened at title and abstract and full-text using pre-specified inclusion criteria. As this research was commissioned by the UK National Institute for Health and Care Research Policy Research Programme, primary studies were limited to UK settings. These were supplemented with international systematic reviews. We also applied a 2010 date limit. Relevant data were extracted and presented narratively and tabulated. One hundred thirty-six studies met the inclusion criteria, including 96 primary studies and 40 systematic reviews. The most frequently occurring rare diseases were motor neurone disease, cystic fibrosis and sickle cell disease. Seventeen types of inequity were identified: delayed diagnosis, lack of knowledge amongst clinicians, lack of information provision, limited services provision (across six different services), limited services for undiagnosed conditions, lack of care co-ordination; in addition, inequity was identified relating to place of residence, race/ethnicity, gender, socioeconomic status, age and disability. This review has drawn attention to experiences of the rare disease community with respect to receipt of a diagnosis and access to services which are different to experiences in the general population, and within the rare disease community itself. Some of these experiences are clearly attributable to factors which are unfair, avoidable and systemic, particularly those which relate to specific groups in the rare disease community. Experiences relating to delayed diagnosis, lack of knowledge, information, care co-ordination and access to various services, also appeared to indicate inequity. These issues are less likely to be encountered with respect to more common diseases experienced in the general population."

This study assessed the association of TSE with clinical benefit from elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (E/T/I), focusing on lung function (ppFEV<sub>1</sub>) and pulmonary exacerbations (PEx). We conducted a retrospective longitudinal analysis of data from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Patient Registry (2019-2021) on PwCF aged ≥ 12 years with documented prescription of E/T/I. TSE was defined by self-report of daily or weekly exposure, including living with a smoker or active smoking. Outcome measures were change in ppFEV<sub>1</sub> and PEx after E/T/I initiation. Mixed effects modeling adjusted for sociodemographic and clinical characteristics quantified the interaction between TSE and E/T/I response. In 15,005 PwCF (mean age 27.7 years, 51.9 % F508del homozygous), TSE was associated with a 2.7 % lower ppFEV<sub>1</sub> (69.1 % vs 71.8 %, p < 0.001) before E/T/I therapy. After E/T/I initiation, ppFEV<sub>1</sub> increased in both groups, with a similar peak ΔppFEV<sub>1</sub> of 8.5 % at 6 months. However, after 6 months on E/T/I therapy, TSE was associated with an additional 0.03 % monthly decrease in ppFEV<sub>1</sub>, resulting in a 3.4 % lower ppFEV<sub>1</sub> (76.3 % vs 79.7 %, p < 0.001) at the end of 2021. Smoke-exposed PwCF on E/T/I had twice the odds of a PEx compared to unexposed counterparts (OR 2.2, p < 0.001). E/T/I increases ppFEV<sub>1</sub> and decreases PEx in all PwCF, but this benefit is not sustained past 6 months of E/T/I therapy among those with TSE, thus widening long-term disparities in pulmonary outcomes."

To determine the phenotypes of AD expression across 12 US birth cohorts and identify factors associated with phenotype and development of allergic diseases. This cohort study compiled longitudinal data from 12 observational US birth cohorts across decades (children born from April 1980 to June 2019) in the Environmental Influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) Children's Respiratory and Environmental Workgroup with follow-up to September 2022. Participants were enrolled prenatally; children with 3 or more AD assessments across the first 84 months of life were included in analyses. Data were analyzed from December 2020 to April 2024. Exposures included decade of birth, cohort type (population-based or high-risk), family history of asthma (mother, father, or sibling), birth order, gestational age at birth, delivery mode, breastfeeding, pet exposure, antibiotic use, environmental tobacco smoke exposure, allergic sensitization, peripheral blood eosinophil count, and total IgE. Primary outcomes were AD phenotype, food allergy, allergic rhinitis, asthma, and wheeze. Longitudinal latent class analysis was used to identify underlying longitudinal patterns of AD expression, and associations of AD phenotype with allergic outcomes were examined using logistic regression, multinomial logistic regression, and linear regression. In 5314 children from 9 cohorts (1896 born in the 2000s [35.7%]; 2585 female [48.6%]; 1083 Black or African American [20.4%]; 3344 White [62.9%]; 350 other reported race [6.6%; including 8 American Indian or Alaska Native (0.2%); 58 Asian (1.1%); 4 Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander (0.1%) and 280 multiracial or with any race not otherwise specified (5.3%)]), 3382 (63.6%) were from a population-based cohort, while 1932 (36.4%) were from a high-risk cohort. AD prevalence ranged from 24.1% (540 children) to 28.4% (1156 children) at each time point, and 5 phenotypes of AD were identified: transient early AD, early AD with potential reoccurrence, late-onset AD, persistent AD, and minimal or no AD. Compared with White children, Black children were at higher risk for AD (transient early AD: aOR, 3.26; 95% CI, 2.06-5.18; early AD with potential reoccurrence: aOR, 3.72; 95% CI, 2.35-5.90; persistent AD: aOR, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.54-2.63), as were children with other reported race (transient early AD: aOR, 2.31; 95% CI, 1.13-4.70; early AD with potential reoccurrence: aOR, 3.27; 95% CI, 1.73-6.18). Female children were significantly less likely to have early AD with potential reoccurrence (aOR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.27-0.74) and persistent AD (aOR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.49-0.74) than male children. Compared with miniml or no AD, phenotypes with early AD expression were associated with food allergy (transient early AD: adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 2.15; 95% CI, 1.48-3.08; early AD with potential reoccurrence: aOR, 2.43; 95% CI, 1.66-3.50; persistent AD: aOR, 2.26; 95% CI, 1.84-2.78), later AD expression was associated with allergic rhinitis (late-onset AD: aOR, 1.84; 95% CI, 1.38-2.43; persistent AD: aOR, 2.02; 95% CI, 1.64-2.48), and any AD disease was associated with asthma. In this birth cohort study of 5314 children, timing of AD expression was associated with increased risk for atopic march pathways. Identifying risk factors for AD phenotypes may inform targeted therapeutic prevention strategies."

    "abstract": "The sweat test (ST) is the gold standard for the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis. There are several reports in the literature regarding conditions that are known to be associated with a false positive result. The aim of this article is to describe a previously unreported cause of a false positive ST. An observational, cross-sectional single-center study was performed. We recruited three patients with a neurosensory deafness caused by a deletion in both alleles of connexin 30. The first-degree relatives of these three patients with hearing impairment due to other mutations were also included. A ST was performed in all the selected cases. Among the three patients with a deletion in both connexin 30 alleles, two had a positive ST, whereas the third patient had a close-to-positivity borderline result (57 mmol/L). Moreover, there were no positive sweat tests in individuals with other mutation patterns. Patients with affection of both alleles of connexin 30 were the only ones to show a positive ST, which may translate to a higher risk of hyponatremic dehydration. The reason for the ST positivity remains unclear and may be related to the fact that connexin 30 plays a role in modulating other molecules in both the inner ear and sweat glands. • The sweat test is the gold standard for the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis. However, the causes of false positives in the test are increasingly recognized. • This study describes a previously unreported cause of a false positive sweat test. Three patients with homozygous mutations in the connexin 30 gene are described. All of them had an abnormal sweat test, and two of them presented with severe hyponatremic dehydration."

    "abstract": "Modulators have revolutionized cystic fibrosis (CF) management, but their effects on respiratory pathogens remain unclear. This study evaluated changes in lower respiratory tract pathogen detection after modulator therapy in children with CF, registered in the Cystic Fibrosis Registry of Turkey. This retrospective, multicenter cohort study included children receiving modulator therapy between 2020 and 2022. Chronic respiratory tract colonization rates before and after therapy were compared, along with inhaler treatments, oral steroid, azithromycin use, pulmonary function tests, and hospitalizations for pulmonary exacerbations. The cohort was stratified by age, modulator type, and lung disease severity. Changes in microbiologic data over a 1-year period were also analyzed for children not receiving modulator therapy. A total of 101 children (mean age 9.95 ± 4.44 years) were included. Following modulator therapy, respiratory cultures of 57 (56.4%) were negative. Among 32 children with chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) colonization, 14 (44%) showed negative respiratory cultures after receiving modulator therapy (p = 0.039). Conversion to culture-negative status was significant for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) (p = 0.022) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (p = 0.034), with ETI therapy yielding the highest conversion rates. Inhaled antibiotic use for chronic respiratory pathogens decreased significantly (p = 0.039), and spirometry parameters improved (p < 0.001). Among 1232 children not receiving modulators, 180 (14.6%) had negative respiratory cultures when examined at 1-year interval. In the same group, intermittent/chronic P. aeruginosa colonization was negative in 58 cases, while 85 developed new growth, following modulator therapy, with positivity rates rising from 16.3% to 18.5% (p = 0.030). No significant changes in other pathogen detection were observed. Modulators, particularly ETI, reduced respiratory pathogen detection and improved lung function in children with CF."

    "abstract": "Growing evidence links immune dysfunction, notably impaired IFNγ production, to chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA), but understanding of the immune phenotype in CPA patients remains limited. To investigate this, we recruited 25 CPA patients and 25 controls with bronchiectasis, isolating immune cells from peripheral blood for detailed flow cytometric phenotyping at resting state and after ex vivo stimulation with the TLR2/Dectin-1 agonist Zymosan. CPA patients exhibited pronounced neutrophilia and a reduced frequency of conventional dendritic cell (DC) subsets at baseline compared to bronchiectasis controls. Post-stimulation, DC and monocyte subsets in CPA patients showed significantly lower expression of activation markers. Notably, cDC1s displayed reduced IL-12p40, TNFα, and CD86 expression. CPA patients with a history of tuberculosis (TB) had significantly higher frequencies of activated cDC1s. Machine learning analysis validated these immunological parameters as predictive of CPA status. Our findings suggest that immune dysfunction in CPA involves DC and monocyte impairments, potentially contributing to IFNγ deficiency through reduced IL-12 production and co-stimulatory capacity in cDC1s. These results also hint at the presence of innate immune memory in CPA patients with prior TB. Our study advances understanding of the immune dysfunction underlying CPA."

    "title": "A fluorescence-based protocol to monitor bacterial antagonism.",
    "abstract": "Bacteria are often found in polymicrobial communities where competition for limited space and resources drives antagonistic interactions. Therefore, bacteria have evolved various antibacterial weapons to outcompete their neighbors. These antagonistic interactions can have profound effects on the structure, dynamics, and composition of bacterial communities. To study interactions between two bacterial species, co-culture assays are often employed. The most common approach utilizes selection plates for each bacterial species to quantify recovery after co-incubation. Although this method is relatively accurate and inexpensive, there are some limitations. These assays can be time-consuming, low-throughput, and may present difficulties if the bacteria of interest show similar resistance patterns to one another or if the tolerance to selective agents is unknown. Here, we have developed and validated a method that uses fluorescence as a proxy to screen antibacterial interactions between two species. We utilized two fluorescently tagged bacteria, <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> JE2 and <i>Escherichia coli</i> DH5⍺, both expressing a red fluorescent protein (RFP), and competed them against non-fluorescent bacteria: two strains of <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> or one strain of <i>Stenotrophomonas maltophilia</i>. We observed that RFP production correlates with growth in the reporter strains and that a reduction in relative fluorescent units from the reporter strains corresponds with a reduction in colony-forming units. This method is fast, semi-quantitative, semi-high-throughput, and can be used to rapidly screen for antagonistic activity during bacterial co-cultures. We propose that our protocol can be a useful tool to detect antibacterial activity using fluorescently labeled target bacteria.IMPORTANCEIn nature, bacteria often reside in communities where limited space and resources drive competition. Bacterial antagonistic interactions can profoundly affect microbial communities. A common approach to study these interactions is to measure the recovery of each bacterium after competition by using selective media. While relatively accurate and inexpensive, this approach has a few limitations: the assay can be labor-intensive and time-consuming, is low throughput, and can present issues when the bacterial strains of interest have similar antimicrobial resistance or if their resistance profile is unknown. We developed and validated a fast and semi-high-throughput protocol that gauges antagonistic bacterial interactions using fluorescence as a proxy. As proof of principle, this screening protocol was tested with known antagonistic bacteria, using a fluorescently labeled target bacterium."

    "abstract": "For many years the major cause of morbidity and mortality in people with cystic fibrosis (PWCF) was lung disease, characterized by progressive airway inflammation, bacterial colonization and premature death. With the advent of highly effective modulator therapies (HEMT) many of the parameters predicting premature death have been beneficially altered with resultant predicted improvement in survival. It is unknown how much residual airway inflammation will persist in PWCF on HEMT, whether bacterial colonization will be eradicated and whether the beneficial effects decrease over times. In addition, a significant number of PWCF cannot avail of HEMT. We discuss pathogenesis of airways disease in CF, airway inflammation and bacterial colonization in PWCF on and off HEMT, and whether new anti-inflammatory strategies are required to decrease residual inflammation and improve bacterial eradication. We discuss the potential therapeutic options for those PWCF for whom HEMT are not an option. PWCF on HEMT may expect prolonged survival but in many, particularly those in whom HEMT therapy was instituted after the onset of structural lung disease there will be persistent inflammation requiring further therapy."

Improved survival has revealed rare complications such as constrictive pericarditis and cardiac tamponade. A 24-year-old female with cystic fibrosis, diagnosed at nine months, presented with two weeks of dyspnoea. Examination revealed bilateral rhonchi, facial oedema and non-pitting thigh oedema. Laboratory results showed a white blood cell count of 11.3 ×10<sup>9</sup>/l, erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 99 mm/hr and C-reactive protein level of 45.3 mg/dl. Initially admitted for cystic fibrosis exacerbation, she was found to have pericardial effusion. Despite facial and lower extremity swelling, she denied cardiac symptoms. During hospitalisation, she developed haemodynamic instability requiring pericardiocentesis, with echocardiography confirming constrictive pericarditis. Chest computed tomography angiography showed pericardial calcifications; autoimmune workup was negative. She was discharged on colchicine with close follow-up. Clinicians should have a high index of suspicion for underlying cardiac complications in patients presenting with exacerbations of cystic fibrosis. Pericardial disease - including constrictive pericarditis and tamponade - though rare, can complicate cystic fibrosis in adults and may mimic pulmonary exacerbations. Early cardiac imaging is crucial for timely diagnosis.This case highlights the need for a high index of suspicion in cystic fibrosis patients with unexplained dyspnoea, oedema or haemodynamic instability, especially in the setting of pericardial calcifications.Medical management with colchicine and diuretics can be effective in selected cystic fibrosis patients with constrictive physiology, potentially avoiding the need for invasive pericardiectomy."

    "abstract": "Pancreatitis is a potentially fatal and difficult to control exocrine-tissue defect with no FDA approved therapies to date. Variants of a chloride/bicarbonate transporter cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), increase the risk of pancreatitis by two- to three-fold in up to 40% of the patients. However, the relationship between the duct-restricted CFTR-function and total exocrine tissue defect during pancreatitis remains less known and animal models do not clearly translate to human disease. To overcome this challenge, we developed a robust iPSC-derived model system of pancreatic ductal tissues from an idiopathic pancreatitis patient with a common <i>CFTR</i> variant to understand CFTR-associated ductal tissue pancreatitis leading to the complete exocrine defect. In the patient line termed PANx, we found deficient CFTR function as well as a distinct gene expression signature for ductal tissue pancreatitis marked by aberrant mucin production, inflammatory cytokines and pancreatic neoplasms. By applying clinically used CFTR-modulator drug ivacaftor, we observed a remarkable restoration of deficient CFTR-mediated fluid secretion as well as upto 40% reversal of the differential gene signature for PANx including the reduction in mucinous neoplasms and cytokines such as IL-11, CCL20 and CXCL8 that drive immune cell infilteration during pancreatitis. We further employed a microsystem device that modeled pancreatitis-associated hyperamylasemia, a diagnostic feature of acute pancreatitis attack, due to a ductal reaction affecting acinar cell-released amylase and viability. The key mucinous signature was validated in primary pancreatitis ductal tissues with a <i>CFTR</i> variant. Overall, we unraveled new layers of CFTR-related pathology in pancreatitis to help us better understand the course of this debilitating condition. Additionally, the test methods and model systems discovered in this study will significantly expedite the discovery of diagnostic and therapeutic tools for treating idiopathic pancreatitis. For the first time, we provided molecular and physiologic evidence supporting the benefit of CFTR modulator drug ivacaftor in human CFTR-related pancreatitis."

    "abstract": "Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a multiorgan disease caused by mutations in the <i>CFTR</i> gene, leading to chronic pulmonary infections and hyperinflammation. Among pathogens colonizing the CF lung, <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> is predominant, infecting over 50% of adults with CF, and becoming antibiotic-resistant over time. Current therapies for CF, while providing tremendous benefits, fail to eliminate persistent bacterial infections, chronic inflammation, and irreversible lung damage, necessitating novel therapeutic strategies. Our group engineered mesenchymal stromal cell derived extracellular vesicles (MSC EVs) to carry the microRNA let-7b-5p as a dual anti-infective and anti-inflammatory treatment. MSC EVs are low-immunogenicity platforms with innate antimicrobial and immunomodulatory properties, while let-7b-5p reduces biofilm formation and inflammation. In a preclinical CF mice model, we reported that let-7b-5p-loaded MSC EVs reduced <i>P. aeruginosa</i> burden, immune cells, and proinflammatory cytokines in the lungs. We hypothesize four complementary mechanisms for the observed <i>in</i>-<i>vivo</i> effects of the let-7b-5p loaded MSC EVs: antimicrobial activity, anti-inflammatory properties, inhibition of antibiotic-resistant <i>P. aeruginosa</i> biofilm formation in CF airways, and stimulation of anti-inflammatory macrophage behaviors. This study focused on the second and third mechanisms and demonstrates that MSC EVs engineered to contain let-7b-5p effectively blocked the formation of antibiotic-resistant <i>P. aeruginosa</i> biofilms on primary human bronchial epithelial cells (pHBECs) while also reducing <i>P. aeruginosa</i>-induced inflammation. This approach holds promise for improving outcomes for people with CF. Future work will focus on optimizing delivery strategies and expanding the clinical applicability of MSC EVs to target other CF-associated pathogens."

    "abstract": "Cystic fibrosis (CF), a common genetic disease, is caused by a defective CF-transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). People with CF (pwCF) are prone to develop infections by opportunistic pathogens, including Burkholderia cenocepacia, leading to chronic inflammation and lung function loss. Neutrophils, the most abundant cells in the chronically inflamed lungs of pwCF, release granular proteins and oxida-tive products that contribute to tissue damage. The CFTR modulators are a new treat-ment for pwCF aiming to correct the subcellular location and function of the CFTR ion channel. The triple modulator combination of Elexacaftor, Tezacaftor, and Ivacaftor (ETI) or Trikafta® has significantly improved clinical symptoms and overall provided a better quality of life for pwCF. The mechanism by which the CFTR modulators help to restore the antimicrobial functions of neutrophils is unknown. The present study demonstrates that neutrophils functionally express CFTR and reveals how ETI modi-fies subcellular CFTR trafficking in CF neutrophils. In addition, ETI treatment reduces intracellular chloride levels in human neutrophils, indicating activation of CFTR-dependent chloride efflux (outflow). Finally, ETI treatment also re-established the intra-cellular antimicrobial killing of CF neutrophils by potentiating NADPH oxidase activity and producing Neutrophil Extracellular Traps (NETs). Together, our findings suggest that CFTR has an essential role in controlling neutrophil functions and that the CFTR modulators improve the health of pwCF by restoring the antimicrobial functions of CF neutrophils."

    "abstract": "Functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) and inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) present significant challenges for both pediatric and adult populations. The low FODMAP diet (LFD) has gained prominence as an evidence-based dietary intervention, offering symptom relief for abdominal pain, bloating, and altered bowel habits. However, concerns about adherence, nutritional adequacy, and long-term safety remain critical, particularly in pediatric populations. This narrative review examines the nature and physiological impact of FODMAPs, focusing on the practical application of the low-FODMAP diet (LFD) in adults and pediatric gastroenterology. Particular attention is given to emerging insights into its impact on gut microbiota and long-term safety. While LFD effectively alleviates symptoms in FGIDs and functional symptoms in IBD, its restrictive nature demands professional supervision to mitigate nutritional risks. For pediatric patients, adherence and reintroduction protocols require optimization. Further research into personalized dietary approaches and microbiome-targeted strategies could enhance the clinical utility of the LFD, ensuring its long-term safety and efficacy for diverse patient groups. Many people, both children and adults, experience stomach and bowel problems like pain, bloating, and changes in bowel habits. These symptoms are common in conditions such as functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs). One dietary approach, called the low FODMAP diet (LFD), has been shown to help reduce these symptoms. The diet limits certain types of carbohydrates, called FODMAPs, which are found in foods like some fruits, vegetables, dairy products, and grains. These carbohydrates can ferment in the gut, causing discomfort in some people.This review looks at how the LFD works, its effectiveness, and its safety. Research shows that the diet can reduce symptoms for many people, particularly those with FGIDs, and it can also help people with IBD who experience additional gut symptoms even when their disease is not active. However, the LFD is a restrictive diet, which means it may be hard to follow and could lead to nutritional issues, especially in children, without professional support.The review also explores how the LFD affects gut bacteria, as the diet can reduce some beneficial bacteria. To make the diet more practical, researchers recommend working with dietitians to ensure it is followed safely and effectively. More studies are needed to understand the long-term impact of the LFD and how it can be adapted to different people's needs.This summary aims to explain the benefits and challenges of the LFD, highlighting the importance of professional guidance and further research to improve its use."

This study aimed to assess sweat test performance and implement a quality improvement project (QIP) to reduce QNS rates.MethodsA two-part retrospective audit was conducted. Part one spanned 2 years reviewing the two-tiered testing with sweat conductivity as a screening tool, followed by chloride testing. Part two evaluated the QNS rates over two 6-month periods, separated by a QIP, which involved technologist training, clinician education, patient preparation protocols and revised testing procedures.ResultsOver the 2-year period, 425 sweat tests were performed on 291 patients. Sweat conductivity testing demonstrated a lower QNS rate, 13% (31/238), compared to sweat chloride testing's 31% (33/105). High QNS rates were observed in younger infants and in malnourished or acutely ill patients. Post-QIP, the QNS rates for the total study population decreased by 5%, from an initial 30% to 25% in the sweat chloride cohort, while the acceptable QNS rate of 12% remained unchanged in the sweat conductivity cohort.ConclusionAchieving target QNS rates remains challenging, especially in younger infants, with improved QNS rates in older infants and children.

It primarily affects the cardiovascular, ocular, and skeletal systems. Despite improved survival outcomes, organ donation from these patients remains rare due to concerns of vascular fragility. A 44-year-old male with Marfan syndrome was considered for organ donation following brain stem death due to a massive intracerebral hemorrhage caused by a ruptured arteriovenous malformation. He had a history of mitral valve replacement and kyphoscoliosis. His liver and renal function tests were within normal limits. Consent for donation was subsequently obtained. Intra-operative findings revealed a grossly deformed liver and thin, friable vasculature, prompting the retrieval team to abandon the procedure. Biopsies from the liver and iliac artery were obtained for histopathological evaluation. Liver histology showed mild fibrosis without significant steatosis or inflammation. Iliac artery biopsy revealed cystic medionecrosis (with risk of aneurysmal formation), typically seen in Marfan syndrome. Although limited literature exists on organ donation in Marfan syndrome, rare successful liver transplants have been reported. However, vascular fragility and risk of aneurysmal changes remain a concern. Our intra-operative findings and supporting histology reinforce the challenges in safely retrieving organs from donors with Marfan syndrome. While expanding donor criteria is crucial in meeting growing transplant demands, this case highlights the importance of careful intra-operative assessment and maintenance of a low threshold for abandonment in the presence of concerning vascular or organ abnormalities in donors with Marfan syndrome."

Dysregulation of this enzyme is increasingly being associated with the progression of 2 prominent types of diseases, namely viral infections, such as COVID-19, and cardiovascular disorders, such as atrial fibrillation (AF), positioning it as a potential therapeutic target. With regard to coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), SGK1 detrimentally affects inflammatory pathways and modulates the cytokine storm, leading to lung tissue damage. Considering this dysregulation, researchers are exploring SGK1 inhibition as a potential strategy for mitigating severe COVID-19 outcomes. SGK1 also regulates pumps and ion channels, significantly affecting cardiac performance in AF. This protein is responsible for promoting fibrosis and inflammation in the cardiac tissue, making it a potential target for reducing atrial fibrillation. SGK1 inhibition offers a new avenue for therapeutic targets against both COVID-19 and AF. This review is aimed at providing a comprehensive overview of SGK1 dysregulation in both diseases, underscoring the urgent need for more preclinical and clinical trials to evaluate effective SGK1 inhibitors for patients with coexisting COVID-19 and AF."

We assessed glycemic control, body weight and composition (with bio-impedance analysis), liver fibrosis and steatosis (with transient elastography). Amylase, lipase levels and concomitant therapies were recorded at basal and follow up evaluations. Patients had an e-mail contact to report any adverse events. We observed a significant decrease in fasting plasma glucose, HbA1c, weight, BMI, waist circumference. We demonstrated a reduction in total and LDL cholesterol. Liver stiffness decreased during the first 6 months. The rate of adverse events was low and the symptoms reported didn't require any medical measures: 26.9% reported mild nausea, only 3 patients (7.69%) discontinued the drug dose due to gastrointestinal intolerance. No pancreatitis episodes were detected, amylase and lipase levels didn't increase (despite concomitant calcineurin inhibitors). No adjustments in immunosuppressant therapy were reported. Among the 45 patients requiring insulin when a GLP1RA therapy was added on, 20 (33.2%) and 31 (45.5%) could suspend insulin therapy at, respectively, 6 and 18 months. In conclusion, GLP1RA-based therapy can be considered safe and effective in a short-term follow up in liver-transplanted patients. Further studies are needed to assess the effects of this drugs on long term complications, such as renal impairment, cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality."

However, the initiating events that predispose the CF lung to cycles of infection, inflammation and resultant tissue damage are still unclear. Inflammation may occur in the CF lung prior to birth in human and several large animal models suggesting an in utero origin for the disease and encouraging further studies prior to birth. Here we used the sheep model of CF (CFTR<sup>-/-</sup>) and age-matched wild-type (WT) sheep of the same breed to investigate the single cell transcriptomes of proximal and distal lung tissue at 80 days and 120 days of gestation and at term (147 days). Single cell RNA-seq was performed on tissues from 4 to 7 animals of each genotype (WT and CFTR<sup>-/-</sup>) at each time point. At term, FOXJ1-expressing ciliated cells are overrepresented in both lung regions from CFTR<sup>-/-</sup> lambs, while secretory epithelial and basal cells are underrepresented in proximal lung, as are T cells and monocytes in distal lung. The imbalance in ciliated and basal cells was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. At 120 days of gestation, lymphoid cells are slightly more abundant in proximal and distal lung from CFTR<sup>-/-</sup> animals compared to WT, consistent with the transient CF-associated inflammatory response in utero. At 80 days of gestation, T and B cells are underrepresented in both lung regions. The differences in epithelial cell abundance observed in the CFTR<sup>-/-</sup> lambs at term may reflect sequelae from the loss of CFTR on lung development and differentiation in utero. These findings provide novel insights into the cellular mechanisms of pathology and may be relevant to the design of new therapeutic approaches for CF lung disease."

Here, we demonstrate proof-of-concept of multiorgan mutation correction in CF using peptide nucleic acids encapsulated in polymeric nanoparticles and delivered systemically in utero. In utero editing was associated with sustained postnatal CFTR activity, at a level similar to that of wild-type mice, in both respiratory and gastrointestinal tissues, without detection of off-target mutations in partially homologous loci. This work suggests that systemic in utero gene editing represents a viable strategy for treating monogenic diseases before birth that impact multiple tissue types."

    "title": "Phage steering in the presence of a competing bacterial pathogen.",
    "abstract": "The rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria has necessitated the development of alternative therapeutic strategies, such as bacteriophage therapy, where viruses infect bacteria, reducing bacterial burden. However, rapid bacterial resistance to phage treatment remains a critical challenge, potentially leading to failure. Phage steering, which leverages the evolutionary dynamics between phage and bacteria, offers a novel solution by driving bacteria to evolve away from virulence factors or resistance mechanisms. In this study, we examined whether phage steering using bacteriophage Luz19 could function in the presence of a competing pathogen, <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (<i>SA</i>) (USA300), while targeting <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> (PAO1). Through <i>in vitro</i> co-evolution experiments with and without the competitor, we observed that Luz19 consistently steered <i>P. aeruginosa</i> away from the Type IV pilus (T4P), a key virulence factor, without interference from <i>SA</i>. Genomic analyses revealed mutations in T4P-associated genes, including <i>pilR</i> and <i>pilZ</i>, which conferred phage resistance. Our findings suggest that phage steering remains effective even in polymicrobial environments, providing a promising avenue for enhancing bacteriophage therapy efficacy in complex infections.IMPORTANCEPhage steering-using phages that bind essential virulence or resistance-associated structures-offers a promising solution by selecting for resistance mutations that attenuate pathogenic traits. However, it remains unclear whether this strategy remains effective in polymicrobial contexts, where interspecies interactions may alter selective pressures. Here, we demonstrate that <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> evolves phage resistance via loss-of-function mutations in Type IV pilus (T4P) when challenged with the T4P-binding phage Luz19 and that this evolutionary trajectory is preserved even in the presence of a competing pathogen, <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>. Phage resistance was phenotypically confirmed via twitching motility assays and genotypically via whole-genome sequencing. These findings support the robustness of phage steering under interspecies competition, underscoring its translational potential for managing complex infections-such as those seen in cystic fibrosis-where microbial diversity is the norm."

    "abstract": "Excessive antibiotic use can lead to gut microbiota dysbiosis, resulting in diarrhea. This study aimed to investigate the effects of <i>Bifidobacterium animalis</i> QC08 (QC08) on the antibiotic-induced diarrhea mouse model using lincomycin hydrochloride. Mice were divided into five groups: normal, diarrhea, a drug group, high-dose QC08 (QC08-H), low-dose QC08 (QC08-L). Compared with the diarrhea group, the QC08-H and QC08-L groups showed a decrease in serum serotonin, interleukin (IL)-17A, IL-6, and malondialdehyde levels, whereas total antioxidant capacity levels increased. In the colon and small intestine tissues of QC08-H and QC08-L treated mice, mRNA expression of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and transforming growth factor β1 (TGFβ1) was significantly downregulated, whereas expression of sodium-hydrogen exchanger 1 (NHE1) and NHE4 was upregulated compared to the AAD model group. Altogether, this in vivo study demonstrates the potential of QC08 in alleviating AAD in mice, providing valuable insights for understanding and potentially treating antibiotic-related gut issues."

By leveraging this technology, researchers can precisely cut, paste, and even rewrite DNA sequences within living cells. Nevertheless, the application of CRISPR screen technology goes far beyond mere experimentation. It serves as a pivotal tool in the fight against genetic diseases, systematically dissecting complex genetic landscapes, empowering researchers to unravel the molecular mechanisms underlying biological phenomena, and enabling scientists to identify and target the root causes of illnesses such as cancer, cystic fibrosis, and sickle cell anemia. Among all, cancer poses a formidable challenge for medicine, spurring eradication efforts. Radiotherapy, as a traditional treatment, yields results but has limitations. It eradicates cancer cells but also damages healthy tissues, causing adverse effects that reduce quality of life. Additionally, not all cancer cells respond to radiotherapy, and some may develop resistance, worsening the condition. To address this, a comprehensive whole-genome CRISPR screen technology is introduced, as it enables the efficient identification of radiosensitive and radioresistant genes, thereby advancing the field of cancer research and treatment. A genome-wide CRISPR screen was conducted in lung adenocarcinoma cells exposed to irradiation following the described protocol, through which both radioresistance- and radiosensitivity-associated genes were identified."

    "abstract": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a gram-negative clinical pathogen, particularly affecting immunocompromised patients, those with cystic fibrosis, and burn victims. It causes chronic infections, especially in hospital settings, and is a significant contributor to nosocomial infections. Its capacity to create biofilms resistant to antibiotics is the reason for its infamous persistence in clinical settings. P. aeruginosa infections can affect any area of the body because the bacteria's biofilm enables it to stick to any surface, living or non-living. One of the primary clinical challenges in treating P. aeruginosa biofilm is its noteworthy resistance to many classes of antibiotics. The bacterium's ability to acquire resistance through efflux pumps, beta-lactamase production, and genetic mutations complicates treatment options. Recently, multidrug- resistant (MDR) strains of P. aeruginosa are becoming increasingly prevalent, limiting the efficacy of traditional antibiotics and leading to the need for alternative therapies. There is an ongoing need for novel treatment options, including bacteriophage therapy, antimicrobial peptides, and vaccines. The rapid adaptability of P. aeruginosa and its ability to develop resistance underscores the importance of continued research into new therapeutic strategies. This review discusses the various therapeutic strategies like; antimicrobial therapy, targeting efflux pumps and biofilms of P. aeruginosa, phage therapy, immunotherapy and nanotechnology to explore the mechanisms, through which antimicrobial compounds interact with biofilm structures and the bacteria within."

In light of the limited therapeutic options currently available, the exploration of AS as a target for drug development is of paramount importance. This review offers an exhaustive analysis of the biological functions and underlying molecular mechanisms associated with various AS-induced splice variants, RNA-binding proteins, and <i>cis</i>-elements, highlighting their significance as clinical biomarkers. We place particular emphasis on the current therapeutic applications of AS in an array of lung diseases, including but not limited to lung cancer, cystic fibrosis, silicosis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, pneumonia, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, pulmonary arterial hypertension, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. The review delves into the role of AS events in the diagnosis and treatment of lung diseases, focusing on the regulatory influence of splicing factors and RNA-binding proteins, while also enumerating the mutated components implicated in AS misregulation. Consequently, a comprehensive understanding of the intricate mechanisms governing these splicing events could potentially offer novel avenues for the development of splicing-targeted therapeutics and diagnostic tools for the prevention and treatment of lung diseases."

They are generally highly vascularized solid tumors, often round in shape with clear boundaries, defined contours, and a homogeneous internal structure. However, they can also present with atypical features, such as cystic degeneration, hemorrhage, calcification, and fibrosis, making diagnosis difficult in some cases. They are also known as comorbidities of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1). This report describes a case in which endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) led to a diagnosis of MEN1. A 50-year-old man was referred to our hospital for examination of a mass in the pancreatic body. An EUS-guided fine-needle biopsy was performed, and a histological diagnosis of neuroendocrine tumor (NET) was made. In addition, the NET was also identified in the duodenum. Serum calcium and parathyroid hormone levels were elevated. Examination of the parathyroid and pituitary glands revealed concurrent hyperparathyroidism and a pituitary adenoma, confirming the diagnosis of MEN1, including a NET in the duodenum."

Shear wave elastography revealed the presence of mild liver fibrosis. The patient recovered with broad-spectrum antibiotics. Genetic testing found no evidence of variation in the <i>PKHD1</i> gene. However, a heterozygous deletion of the <i>PKD1</i> gene was identified, a deletion that has not previously been linked to disease, and therefore the patient's family was offered genetic analysis.

This study aims to characterize the relationship between constipation during hospitalization and the symptoms, complications, and associated health-care costs of constipation in the National Inpatient Sample database. National Inpatient Sample was queried for discharges in the general population and PwCF from the years 2015-2019. Using International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision codes, hospitalized PwCF were matched with the general population on the Charlson comorbidity index, markers of hospitalization severity, and demographics. Subsequently, both were split into 2 cohorts: one with comorbid constipation and one without. Study outcomes were adjusted for gastrointestinal comorbidities, age, sex, and indication for admission. Of 135,860 discharges, constipation was present in 14.0% in PwCF and 5.6% in the general population with average total charges of $104,270 and length of stay (LOS) of 8.8 days. Constipation was independently associated with increased LOS (1.22 days, standard error [SE] 0.21) and total charges ($14,280, SE $12,308) among PwCF, despite undergoing a similar number of endoscopic procedures (-0.02 SE 0.06). These findings were unchanged on subgroup analysis for sex and indication for hospitalization. Subgroup analysis showed a persistent association of higher costs with constipation in those with pancreatic insufficiency but not those with pancreatic sufficiency ($22,053 vs $493) despite a similar LOS. Comorbid constipation in hospitalized PwCF was independently associated with increased LOS and costs. The association worsened in those with pancreatic insufficiency."

Evidence supporting the benefits of BD is conflicting, with limited data to assist physicians in clinical practice. The present survey aims to evaluate current use of BD in children and adolescents with gastrostomy. An online survey evaluating the use of BD in children with gastrostomy was sent to members of the European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition with expertise on gastrointestinal motility. The questions assessed clinical indications, level of experience, preferred diet composition, and clinical outcomes. We collected 26 questionnaires filled out by members from 13 different countries. Most of the respondents (84.6%) are pediatric gastroenterologists, with 69.2% visiting gastrostomy patients on a daily/weekly basis. The majority of the sample (61.5%) declares to use BD, but only in selected conditions, and only 38.5% reports an advanced experience with BD. The main reason for BD prescription is parental request (53.8%). In addition, 57.7% prefers homemade BD compared to only 15.4% that relies on commercial BD. Finally, 69.2% states to find an impact on gastrointestinal symptoms. Positive clinical outcomes are reported for vomiting (61.1%), constipation (50%), nausea (38.9%), and bloating (38.9%). The main reason for not using BD is the non-standard nutritional composition. BD are commonly used in clinical practice. However, due to the lack of conclusive evidence and well-designed studies, there is great variability in diet composition and clinical indications. Given the increasing demand from caregivers and the potential positive outcomes, further studies are needed to provide insights and guide healthcare professionals in their clinical practice."

    "abstract": "Vitamin D deficiency is a common pathology in people with cystic fibrosis (PwCF) due to the malabsorption of fat-soluble vitamins. Vitamin D plays an integral role in bone health and lung immunity; therefore, treating deficiencies is a clinical priority in PwCF. Highly effective modulator therapy (HEMT) improves the function of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein that is altered in PwCF, resulting in improved lung function and fat absorption. However, the impact of HEMT on restoring vitamin D status, a fat-soluble vitamin, has not been fully elucidated. We retrospectively examined serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) up to ten years prior in 89 young adults with CF classified based on current HEMT use (yes or no). We used two-way ANOVA to evaluate trends in both groups. Both HEMT users (n = 68) and HEMT non-users (n = 21) on average exhibited decreased serum 25(OH)D levels over ten years (-14.2 ng/mL (SI 35.4 nmol/L) and -14 ng/mL (SI 34.9 nmol/L) respectively), with no difference in change between the two groups (p = 0.44). This suggests that HEMT may not correct vitamin D status in PwCF. Further large scale prospective studies are needed to comprehensively investigate the relationship between vitamin D and HEMT."

    "title": "Species turnover within cystic fibrosis lung microbiota is indicative of acute pulmonary exacerbation onset.",
    "abstract": "Acute pulmonary exacerbations (PEx) are associated with increased morbidity and earlier mortality for people living with cystic fibrosis (pwCF). The most common causes of PEx in CF are by bacterial infection and concomitant inflammation leading to progressive airway damage. To draw attention to the seriousness of PEx they have been labelled as 'lung attacks', much like a 'heart attack' for acute myocardial infarction. Treatment typically starts when a pwCF presents with worsening respiratory symptoms. Hence, there is a pressing need to identify indicative biomarkers of PEx onset to allow more timely intervention. Set within an ecological framework, we investigated temporal microbiota dynamics to connect changes in the lung microbiota of pwCF to changes in disease states across a PEx event. Species-time relationships (STR) describe how the richness of a community changes with time, here STRs were used to assess temporal turnover (w) within the lung microbiota of each pwCF (n = 12, mean sample duration 315.9 ± 42.7 days). STRs were characterised by high interpatient variability, indicating that turnover and hence temporal organization are a personalized feature of the CF lung microbiota. Greater turnover was found to be significantly associated with greater change in lung function with time. When microbiota turnover was examined at a finer scale across each pwCF time series, w-values could clearly be observed to increase in the exacerbation period, then peaking within the treatment period, demonstrating that increases in turnover were not solely a result of perturbations caused by PEx antibiotic interventions. STR w-values have been found to have a remarkable degree of similarity for different organisms, in a variety of habitats and ecosystems, and time lengths (typically not exceeding w = 0.5). Here, we found w-values soon increased beyond that. It was therefore possible to use the departure from that expected norm up to start of treatment to approximate onset of PEx in days (21.2 ± 8.9 days across the study participants). Here, we illustrate that changes in turnover of the lung microbiota of pwCF can be indicative of PEx onset in considerable advance of when treatment would normally be initiated. This offers translational potential to enable early detection of PEx and consequent timely intervention. Video Abstract."

    "abstract": "People with cystic fibrosis (PwCF) often have fecal dysbioses relative to those without CF, characterized by increased pro-inflammatory microbiota and gastrointestinal (GI) inflammation as measured by fecal calprotectin, suggesting that inflammation contributes to CF GI disease. The multicenter observational PROMISE study (NCT04038047) found that calprotectin decreased in PwCF treated with elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI). To better understand the dynamics between fecal dysbiosis and GI inflammation, we characterized the microbiomes of fecal samples from PROMISE and the relationships with calprotectin before, 1-month post, and 6-months post ETI. Fecal microbiota from participants ≥12 y/o were determined by shotgun metagenomic sequencing with random forest modeling and multivariate linear regression analysis to define relationships between microbiota, calprotectin, and deltaF508 genotype before and after ETI. We analyzed 345 samples from 124 participants. At baseline, we observed community-level differences in the fecal microbiota among participants with abnormal compared to normal calprotectin. With ETI, the relative abundances of 7 bacterial species - Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium scindens, Enterocloster clostridioformis, Clostridium butyricum, Anaeroglobus geminatus, and Ruminococcus gnavus - decreased significantly, correlating with calprotectin decrease. We detected community-level differences in the fecal microbiota based on CFTR genotype and a distinct pattern of microbiota change in F508del homozygous compared to heterozygous participants after ETI. We identified 7 species for which fecal abundances decreased with ETI and correlated with calprotectin decrease, supporting a close relationship between fecal microbiota and inflammation in PwCF. Future work will define these relationships with metabolites and GI symptoms during long-term ETI therapy."

Infants (aged 1-12 months) without respiratory disease hospitalized for common disorders (e.g. gastroenteritis) underwent NOx (reference). Infants with and without UAO who had NOx were included as validation group. Abnormal basal SpO<sub>2</sub> (<10th percentile for age), oxygen desaturation (≥3 %) index (ODI3) (>90th percentile), cumulative nocturnal hypoxemia score (>90th percentile) and McGill oximetry score (MOS) (>1) were assessed as predictors of UAO requiring intervention (moderate-to-severe UAO). Of 187 infants without respiratory disorder and with NOx, 138 (73.8 %) had acceptable tracings. Basal SpO<sub>2</sub> was not age-related (P = .877; 10th percentile >95 %), while ODI3 and cumulative nocturnal hypoxemia score decreased with age (P < .001). MOS>1 likelihood diminished with age (OR 0.72 [0.59-0.86]; P < .001). For reference validation, 20 infants without respiratory disorder underwent NOx, and NOx of 77 infants with UAO were analyzed retrospectively (32.5 % required intervention post-NOx). Although NOx parameters values in UAO and reference groups partially overlapped, abnormal ODI3, cumulative nocturnal hypoxemia score and MOS were associated with increased odds of moderate-to-severe UAO (OR [95 %CI]: 5.33 [1.93-14.71] for ODI3-10s (≥10s desaturation duration); 3.57 [1.27-9.99]; and 5.98 [1.82-19.69], respectively).

A machine learning-based algorithm trained with information on the biological effects and molecular descriptors of analgesics, anesthetics, hypnotics and opioids predicted antitumor effects for dexmedetomidine (DEX). DEX is a sedative acting as an alpha2-adrenoceptor (ADRA2) agonist. Based on these premises, we investigated the putative antineoplastic effects of DEX. In vitro, DEX promoted premortem stresses such as autophagy and partial endoplasmic reticulum stress with the phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha and the inhibition of the splicing of X-box binding protein 1. DEX elicited the biomarkers of immunogenic cell death, including the release of ATP and high-mobility group box 1 protein, and the cell surface exposure of calreticulin, enhancing the engulfment of malignant cells by dendritic cells. In immunocompetent mice, DEX decreased the progression of colorectal cancers, fibrosarcomas, mammary carcinomas and melanomas, as it improved overall survival. These effects were inhibited by the ADRA2 antagonist yohimbine, suggesting that DEX mediates its anticancer effects at least in part on-target. Depending on the specific tumor model, DEX also enhanced the cytotoxic T cell/regulatory T cell ratio in the tumor bed and draining lymph nodes. Programmed cell death protein 1 blockade tended to improve DEX effects. After rechallenge with antigenically identical cells, no tumor appeared, indicating the formation of immunological memory. These results confirm the machine learning-predicted anticancer activity of DEX. Beyond its utility as a sedative agent in oncological intensive care, DEX may improve anticancer immunosurveillance and sensitize tumors to immune checkpoint blockade."

An observational repeated measures design was used. 6MWD and QS% were recorded at initial assessment, waitlisting, bi-monthly reassessments until transplanted/delisted/died and 2-, 6- 13- 26- and 52-weeks following transplantation. 342 (192 males; mean (±SD) age 51 ± 14 years; 119 COPD, 93 IIP, 72 cystic fibrosis, and 58 other) were studied. Recipients had a mean increase in 6MWD of 170 ± 127 m (p < 0.001) at 52-weeks post.

Pre-transplant 6MWD decreased by -0.059 m (p < 0.001) and QS% increased by 0.014% (p < 0.001) per day between initial assessment to waitlisting (n = 287). Pre-transplant 6MWD and quadriceps strength are independent factors associated with recovery in exercise capacity after lung transplantation. However, candidates had a marked deterioration in 6MWD, but quadriceps strength had improved while being worked up for waitlisting. Quadriceps strength, along with 6MWD, should be considered when determining a candidate's lung transplant suitability."

In this context, growing interest in nanotechnology for pulmonary drug delivery has emerged, driven by its potential to enable localized treatment, reduce dosages, provide controlled release, enhance drug solubility, and improve bioavailability. Among the various nanomaterials explored, poly(lactic-<i>co</i>-glycolic acid) (PLGA)─a copolymer of lactic and glycolic acids─has gained regulatory approval as a safe, biodegradable, and biocompatible carrier, with an extended-release profile, making it an ideal candidate for the development of nanostructured drug delivery systems. Multiple methodologies are available for synthesizing PLGA nanoparticles tailored to pulmonary administration, supported by a wide array of devices designed to cater to individual patient needs. This review seeks to evaluate the advantages of PLGA-based nanoparticles for pulmonary drug delivery, with a focus on their potential to enhance inhalation therapy formulations."

    "abstract": "The sweat test is used as a biological marker of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) dysfunction, but there is growing recognition that sweat chloride concentrations of people with cystic fibrosis (CF) can overlap with those without CF. There are also people without CF whose symptoms are caused by abnormalities of CFTR. To support clinical decisions, the sweat chloride test conducted appropriately should provide consistent results between laboratories and common decision limits should be used. International consensus guidelines now recommend a standard set of clinical decision limits for sweat chloride, with values between 30 and 59 mmol/L, as the intermediate result for all ages. It is therefore timely to update the Australasian guideline decision limits to align with international consensus guidelines and peak body recommendations. At the same time, the technical aspects for performance of the sweat chloride test should be reviewed. This paper updates (and replaces) the guideline for the performance of the sweat chloride test that were last published by the AACB in 2017. This freely available guideline was developed to support Australasian laboratories, and laboratories from other regions, with the accurate performance of sweat chloride testing. The guideline provides 16 recommendations for the performance of the sweat chloride test encompassing the total testing process. Previous recommendations related to sweat conductivity testing have been removed from this guideline. The sweat chloride decision limits of ≥30 mmol/L support a review by a CF physician for all age groups. Sweat chloride concentrations of ≥60 mmol/L are supportive of a diagnosis of CF."

    "abstract": "Over 7000 rare diseases have been described, collectively affecting 350 million people worldwide. Most of these conditions result from nonsense mutations, representing approximately 10% of all genetic mutations associated with human inherited diseases. Nonsense mutations convert a sense codon into a premature termination codon (PTC), leading to premature translation termination and the production of truncated, nonfunctional proteins. This results in a loss-of-function phenotype in many genetic disorders, contributing to the disease's severity and progression. The molecular mechanisms of PTC formation involve various genetic alterations, including single-nucleotide changes, frameshifts, and splicing mutations. The nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway degrades mRNAs containing premature termination codons (PTCs). In contrast, 25% of PTC mRNAs, depending on the PTC position and cellular context, can evade NMD, resulting in the synthesis of truncated proteins. A termination codon during translation is essential for proper protein synthesis, and translational readthrough-a process in which the ribosome bypasses the PTC and reaches the natural stop codon-may restore some level of protein function. The effectiveness of readthrough depends on the surrounding genetic context and the type of amino acid incorporated at the PTC position.

    "title": "New insights into the treatment of asthma complicated by allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis.",
    "abstract": "Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is a lung disorder that arises in individuals with asthma or cystic fibrosis due to an exaggerated immune response to <i>Aspergillus fumigatus</i>. It leads to mucus plugging, recurrent exacerbations, and progressive bronchiectasis. Despite established diagnostic criteria, ABPA remains underdiagnosed, primarily due to its overlap with severe asthma and limited clinical awareness. Evolving insights into immunopathogenesis and the emergence of targeted therapies have begun to transform the management of ABPA. We discuss the current evidence on immunopathogenesis, treatment, and monitoring of ABPA in asthma. The review covers established and emerging therapies, including systemic glucocorticoids, oral triazoles (such as itraconazole), inhaled antifungals, and biological agents. We provide practical guidance for initiating treatment based on disease phenotype and discuss treatment monitoring using clinical symptoms, serum biomarkers, chest imaging, and lung function tests. The management of ABPA is poised for a paradigm shift toward precision medicine. Future strategies will likely be driven by international registries, biomarker discovery using omics-based platforms, and the identification of endotype- and phenotype-specific treatments. Randomized trials comparing biologic therapies, combination approaches using antifungals and biologics, and the development of inhaled antifungal delivery systems are likely to reshape the management of ABPA."

    "abstract": "Fear of hypoglycemia limits sports in type 1 diabetes (T1D). This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of Diabrasport glycemic management algorithms over a week with three real-life exercise sessions. A multicenter non-inferiority study including 43 adults with T1D using insulin pumps, continuous glucose monitoring was conducted over three one-week periods: rest, exercise with personal insulin algorithms (PersonalAlgo), and exercise with Diabrasport insulin algorithms (DiabraAlgo). The exercise period consisted of three sessions of 45-60 min per week of physical activity. DiabraAlgo included: (i) 100% basal rate reduction for intense post-absorptive exercise, (ii) 80% basal rate reduction during moderate exercise in the post-absorptive period and for two hours afterwards, and (iii) 50% prandial bolus reduction for moderate postprandial exercise. Hypoglycemia (<70 mg/dL) was not more frequent with DiabraAlgo (0.88 ± 0.62) during exercise than during rest (1.03 ± 0.61) (95 % CI - 0.04 to 0.33, non-inferiority margin 0.35, p < 0.001). No difference was found between PersonalAlgo and DiabraAlgo in post-absorptive exercise, but during moderate postprandial exercise, DiabraAlgo resulted in less time in hypoglycemia (6.1 ± 9.8 % vs. 10.5 ± 12.8 %, p < 0.05) and fewer hypoglycemic episodes (1.0 ± 1.1 vs. 1.4 ± 1.3, p < 0.05). DiabraAlgo enables an effective adaptation of insulin levels during exercise, promoting their immediate applicability for individuals with T1D."

    "title": "Time to replace the oral glucose tolerance test for cystic fibrosis related diabetes first-step screening? Establishing glycemic tools relevant to cystic fibrosis.",
    "abstract": "As the life expectancy of people with cystic fibrosis (CF) increases, complications related to CF, such as CF-related diabetes (CFRD), are of great concern. Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is the current gold standard test to screen for CFRD, which is associated with reduced lung function and body mass index (BMI). However, this is a cumbersome test with poor adherence, and emerging evidence suggests that HbA1c or serum fructosamine might be viable alternative screening tools. A multi-center study across four Canadian adult CF centers was conducted to determine the ability of HbA1c and serum fructosamine levels to predict screening OGTT results. Cross-sectional outcome data, including ppFEV1 and BMI within two months of testing, were collected. A total of 183 CFRD screening encounters over five years were included. HbA1c and the fructosamine-to-albumin ratio had similar predictive performances for CFRD as determined by OGTT-defined cutoffs (AUC both 0.68) and for impaired glucose tolerance (AUC 0.69 and 0.64, respectively). However, the specificity of FAR is lower, meaning fewer OGTTs can be avoided if FAR is used as a first-step screening test when screening for either CFRD and/or IGT compared to HbA1. The optimal HbA1c cut-off for CFRD screening was ≥5.5% (sensitivity, 95%; specificity, 32%). Regression analyses demonstrated a strong inverse correlation between HbA1c and ppFEV<sub>1</sub> (<i>p</i> < 0.0001), while the OGTT was inversely correlated with ppFEV<sub>1</sub> (<i>p</i> < 0.05), and the fructosamine-to-albumin ratio was inversely correlated with BMI (-0.9; 95% CI -1.5, -0.4; <i>p</i> = 0.002), but not with ppFEV1 within 2 months of testing. HbA1c is validated as a first step in screening for CFRD, allowing one-third of the patients to avoid the OGTT. As HbA1c demonstrated a stronger correlation with ppFEV<sub>1</sub> than the OGTT, consideration could be made to redefine CFRD based on HbA1c."

In addition, changes in ultra-low-dose (ULD) computed tomography (CT) Bhalla score, peripheral-blood and sputum inflammatory cytokines and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), including sino-nasal outcomes test-22 (SNOT-22) and fatigue scale (FACIT-Fatigue). Significant improvements in FEV<sub>1</sub> % pred (p=0.0001), sweat chloride (p<0.0001) and BMI (p=0.0147) after ETI treatment were noted.

    "abstract": "There are limited data on optimal management of chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD). We aimed to describe the variability of diagnostic and therapeutic practices in Europe. A structured questionnaire was sent to 71 centres in 24 countries. Questions were related to contemporary clinical practices for workup, monitoring and treatment of CLAD. The number of lung transplant procedures and patients in follow-up were collected. 44 centres (62%) responded from 20 countries, representing 74% of European activity. The prevalence of CLAD was estimated at 9.1 cases per million population (25th and 75th percentiles of 4.4, 15.7). Preferred initial workup for probable CLAD consisted of chest computed tomography (CT) (inspiratory 91% and expiratory 74%), donor-specific antibody (DSA) measurement (86%), bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) (85%) and transbronchial biopsy (81%). For monitoring of definite CLAD, inspiratory CT (67%), DSA (61%) and BAL (43%) were preferred. Body plethysmography was unavailable for 16% of cases. Prophylaxis was based on preventing infections (cytomegalovirus 99%, inhaled antibiotics 70% and antifungals 65%), tacrolimus-based immunosuppression (96%), azithromycin (72%) and universal proton pump inhibitor treatment (84%). First-line treatment of CLAD was based on azithromycin (82%) and steroid augmentation (74%). Photopheresis was used in 26% of cases. Current European practice CLAD detection is based on spirometry, inspiratory CT and DSA, with limited access to plethysmography and expiratory CT. Prophylactic treatment is based on azithromycin, tacrolimus-based immunosuppression and treatment of risk factors. No single treatment strategy is universally used, highlighting the need for an effective treatment of CLAD. The preferred first-line strategy is azithromycin and steroid augmentation."

Recent VAN TDM guidelines recommend area under the curve (AUC) monitoring to reduce the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI), despite limited evidence to support this practice in adult pwCF. <b>Methods:</b> This single-center, retrospective, observational cohort study included 143 adult pwCF admitted from July 1, 2017, to July 1, 2022, with an acute pulmonary exacerbation that received VAN for at least 72 h with available VAN plasma concentrations for TDM for AUC (<i>n</i> = 39) or trough monitoring (<i>n</i> = 104). Eligible patients with multiple hospital admissions during the study period were incorporated as separate encounters. The primary outcome was the incidence of AKI. <b>Results:</b> Receipt of concurrent nephrotoxins was more common in the AUC cohort than in the trough cohort (97% vs. 81%, <i>p</i> = 0.01), but the rate of AKI was similar (7.7% vs. 10.6%, <i>p</i> = 0.76). AUC monitoring was associated with earlier achievement of TDM goal (median 0 days (IQR 0-2) vs. 2 days (IQR 0-4), <i>p</i> < 0.01), lower total daily doses (34.8 mg/kg/day (IQR 27.6-49) vs. 57.5 mg/kg/day (IQR 43.9-68.6), <i>p</i> < 0.01), and fewer regimen changes (median 1 change (IQR 0-2) vs. 2 changes (IQR 1-3), <i>p</i> < 0.01). In patients with MRSA, pulmonary function recovery, readmission, and mortality were similar. <b>Conclusion:</b> In adult pwCF, the incidence of AKI was similar between AUC and trough monitoring cohorts; however, AUC monitoring achieved therapeutic targets sooner with fewer regimen modifications without significantly increasing the number of concentrations compared to trough monitoring."

    "abstract": "In recent years, it was recognized that type-2 inflammation connects nasal polyposis and severe asthma (SA) in addition to other type-2 diseases. Thus, some biological drugs developed for SA appeared to exert a favourable effect also in nasal polyposis. So far, there are several trials supporting this concept; therefore, some monoclonal antibodies already used for SA were assessed also in chronic rhinosinusistis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP), with promising results. Since different specialists are involved in the management of nasal polyposis (eg, pulmonologists, ENT specialists, allergists, immunologists, pediatricians), it was felt that an updated educational and informative document was needed to better identify the indications of biological therapies in nasal polyposis. We collected the main Italian scientific societies, and prepared (under the umbrella of Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma, ARIA) a document endorsed by all societies, to provide a provisional statement for the future use of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) as a medical treatment for polyposis, possibly associated with SA. The above mentioned document was the first endorsed document on this aspect, and the additional evidence required an update. The current pathogenic knowledge and the experimental evidence are herein reviewed, and some suggestions for a correct prescription and follow-up are provided."

Data were queried from the Vanderbilt University Medical Center clinical genetic database (CGdb), which includes clinically reported pathogenic variants and electronic health records (EHRs) from 2001 to 2023. Based on carrier screening results, we identified individuals heterozygous for a pathogenic CFTR variant and those who tested negative. Logistic regression tested associations between CFTR carrier status and 11 cystic fibrosis (CF)-related phenotypes. A phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) was performed to identify additional phenotypic associations, and manual chart review was conducted to evaluate recognition and clinical application of CFTR carrier status in patients diagnosed with pancreatitis. Among 12,082 women tested, CFTR carriers (n = 451) were at significantly higher risk of developing acute pancreatitis (p = 3.93 × 10<sup>-6</sup>; OR = 4.68 [2.43-9.00]). No other CF-related phenotypes were significantly associated in this female cohort. Manual chart review revealed that CFTR carrier screening results were not clinically correlated with pancreatitis diagnoses. In this large cohort of women tested for prenatal carrier screening, CFTR pathogenic variants relevant to pancreatitis were overlooked, despite informing etiology, management, and prognosis."

    "abstract": "Human airways contain specialized rare epithelial cells including CFTR-rich ionocytes that regulate airway surface physiology and chemosensory tuft cells that produce asthma-associated inflammatory mediators. Here, using a lung cell atlas of 311,748 single cell RNA-Seq profiles, we identify 687 ionocytes (0.45%). In contrast to prior reports claiming a lack of ionocytes in the small airways, we demonstrate that ionocytes are present in small and large airways in similar proportions. Surprisingly, we find only 3 mature tuft cells (0.002%), and demonstrate that previously annotated tuft-like cells are instead highly replicative progenitor cells. These tuft-ionocyte progenitor (TIP) cells produce ionocytes as a default lineage. However, Type 2 and Type 17 cytokines divert TIP cell lineage in vitro, resulting in the production of mature tuft cells at the expense of ionocyte differentiation. Our dataset thus provides an updated understanding of airway rare cell composition, and further suggests that clinically relevant cytokines may skew the composition of disease-relevant rare cells."

We aimed to focus on the evolution of hepatobiliary involvement following lumacaftor-ivacaftor (LI) and elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor (ETI) initiation. A retrospective monocentric observational study included 62 CF children treated with CFTR modulators. Data were collected at initiation and after one year of treatment. The primary objective was to describe the evolution of hepatobiliary involvement under CFTR modulator treatment. We identified hepatobiliary involvement before treatment in 37 patients (59.7 %). Fifteen had persistently (during >6 months) elevated liver enzymes (mostly ALT); 17 had abnormal ultrasound including 3 with nodular liver and 3 with pathological elastography; 5 had isolated splenomegaly. Biliary involvement was found in 19 patients. The evolution of hepatic parameters in the overall population was not significant (p > 0.05). However, we observed a trend towards improvement in laboratory values under treatment. There was only one inaugural diagnosis of nodular liver under LI and none under ETI. All patients had preserved liver function (PT>50 %). We did not find a significant improvement or worsening of hepatobiliary involvement under CFTR modulators. We hypothesize that it could be stabilized with these treatments, but this will need confirmation through further studies with longer follow-up and larger cohorts. The other hypothesis proposed is that biological monitoring may not be an accurate assessment of the hepatobiliary response to modulators. This study supports the safety of CFTR modulator use."

A pre-flight algorithm has previously been validated for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). No such tools are available for CF patients.

    "abstract": "Hypoglycemia in hospitalized patients is a persistent adverse event. Three quality improvement interventions were implemented with the aim of reducing hypoglycemia. Each intervention was targeted at one component of typical inpatient insulin management (basal, prandial, and correction) to attempt to achieve this singular quality improvement aim. Incidence of hypoglycemia in non-obstetrics patients ≥ 19 years of age at a tertiary hospital receiving scheduled insulin before and after the implementation of quality improvement initiatives was compared. Incidence was defined as the number of unique patients with a hypoglycemic event in each month, divided by all admissions for that month. The interventions included integrating weight-based insulin guidance into the electronic medical record (EMR), the addition of a carbohydrate-limited diet, and increasing the threshold for correction insulin administration from 150 mg/dL to 180 mg/dL. After implementation of the interventions, there was a significantly lower incidence of hypoglycemia associated with prandial insulin (p = 0.02) and correction insulin (p < 0.001). There was not a significant decrease in hypoglycemia associated with basal insulin in the overall sample (p =0.25). There was a significant decrease in a subgroup analysis focused on hospital-associated hyperglycemia and type 2 diabetes (via exclusion of patients with type 1 diabetes or cystic fibrosis-related diabetes) (p = 0.005). Notably, following the interventions, there was a reduction in institutional blood glucose readings within goal range (71-179 mg/dL), which presumably translates to an increase in hyperglycemia given the known decrease in hypoglycemia (p value <0.0001). Through a multipronged approach consisting of three unique QI interventions - each targeting one aspect of inpatient insulin management - our academic institution was able to significantly reduce the number of inpatient hypoglycemic events."

These novel therapies improve lung function, decrease pulmonary exacerbations, increase life expectancy, and improve quality of life. Changes in the CF population have also occurred. There are now more adults than children living with CF. A growing proportion of pwCF are black and/or Hispanic, many of whom are ineligible for modulator therapy due to their CF transmembrane regulator mutations, which may further exacerbate disparities in healthcare. Management of pulmonary exacerbations-including shared decision making between pwCF and providers, the limitations of antimicrobial susceptibility testing to predict treatment response, and the role of antimicrobial stewardship-is increasingly recognized by the CF community. Collaborations among infectious diseases specialists, antimicrobial stewards, CF care teams, and clinical microbiology laboratories are increasingly needed to optimize these newer care paradigms."

    "abstract": "Recent reports confirm that cystic fibrosis (CF) is a global disease. In Asian populations, both the spectrum of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene mutations and the clinical course differ from those observed in Western populations. Although the recognition of CF is increasing in South Asia, comprehensive data from Southeast Asian countries remain sparse. The underdiagnosis of CF in Southeast Asia is attributed to limited awareness among healthcare professionals and restricted access to sweat chloride testing. Until 2021, CF had not been documented in the indigenous population of Vietnam. This study presents the first three confirmed cases of CF in native Vietnamese individuals. Additionally, a literature review of CF cases reported across Southeast Asia was conducted to provide insights into its prevalence and variations in CFTR mutation profiles within the region. A total of 50 cases were identified, distributed across Malaysia (30 cases), Thailand (8), the Philippines (6), Vietnam (5), and Indonesia (1), revealing a mutation spectrum distinct from that observed in Caucasian populations. The most common mutations included p.Phe508del and p.Ile1295PhefsX32, each found in 11.5% of cases. These findings highlight the need for increased clinical awareness, expanded access to sweat chloride testing, and the establishment of CF centers and regional CF registries to better understand and manage CF in Southeast Asia."

    "abstract": "Aclarubicin (also called aclacinomycin A) is an antineoplastic from the anthracycline class that is used in China and Japan but not in Europe nor in the USA. Aclarubicin induces much less DNA damage than the classical anthracyclines doxorubicin, daunorubicin, epirubicin, idarubicin, and the anthracene mitoxantrone, but is equally effective in inhibiting DNA-to-RNA transcription and in eliciting immunogenic stress in malignant cells. Accordingly, aclarubicin lacks the DNA damage-associated cardiotoxicity that is dose-limiting for classical anthracyclines. Conversely, aclarubicin is at least as potent as other anthracyclines in inducing immunogenic cell death (ICD), which is key for the mode of action of efficient chemotherapeutics. This combination of reduced toxicity and equivalent ICD-stimulatory activity may explain why, as compared to other anthracyclines, aclarubicin is particularly efficient against acute myeloid leukemia. As a result, we advocate for clinical studies seeking to replace the anthracyclines used in Western medicine by aclarubicin-like compounds. Such clinical studies should not only embrace hematological malignancies but should also concern solid cancers, including those in which ICD-inducing chemotherapies are followed by immunotherapies targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction."

    "abstract": "Porcelain Gallbladder (PGB) is a condition marked by extensive calcification and thickening of the gallbladder wall. PGB is extremely rare in dogs. The exact mechanism of PGB remains unclear. However, chronic cholecystitis and factors such as biliary hyperplasia, mucin hypersecretion, and cystic duct obstruction can lead to fibrosis and calcification of the gallbladder wall, potentially resulting in PGB. A 13-year-old spayed female Shih Tzu presented with anorexia, lethargy, vomiting, and weight loss. Physical exams showed mild epigastric pain. Blood tests indicated mild alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevation, significant alkaline phosphatase, and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) increases. Hyperlipidemia, hypercholesterolemia, and elevated canine pancreatic lipase (cPL) were also noted. Diagnostic imaging revealed extensive gallbladder wall calcification and thickening, choleliths, mild bile duct dilation, pancreatitis, and duodenitis. Cholecystectomy was performed, and symptomatic treatment for pancreatitis and duodenitis was administered. Histopathological examination is essential for confirming PGB by identifying calcification of the gallbladder wall. Histopathological examination of the gallbladder revealed severe papillary hyperplasia, mucin hypersecretion, multiple ulcers, diffuse calcification, and fibrotic changes. These findings confirmed the diagnoses of gallbladder mucocele and PGB. Postoperatively, biochemical markers normalized or significantly decreased, with clinical improvement observed. This study presents the rare occurrence of PGB in dogs and emphasizes the importance of appropriate veterinary intervention for improving clinical outcomes."

    "abstract": "The opportunistic human pathogen <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> (<i>Pa</i>), a leading cause of severe infections, becomes increasingly resistant to antibiotics, including the last resort antibiotic, polymyxin-B (PMB). Previous studies have shown that calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) at the levels encountered during infections increases <i>Pa</i> resistance to PMB. However, the mechanisms of this Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulation are not known. Here, we identified three novel genes (<i>PA2803, PA3237</i> and <i>PA5317)</i> that contribute to the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent PMB resistance in <i>Pa. PA2803</i>, the focus of this work, encodes a putative phosphonatase and is a founding member of the PA2803 subfamily from the Haloacid Dehalogenase Superfamily. Since the transcription of this gene is regulated by both Ca<sup>2+</sup> and inorganic phosphate (P<sub>i</sub>), we named it \"P<sub>i</sub> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulated protein, PcrP\". Congruent with sequence-based predictions, we showed that PcrP lacks catalytic activity and instead binds protein partners, revealing a novel non-catalytic function for PA2803 subfamily proteins. By using pull-down assays and bacterial two-hybrid system, we identified and validated two protein partners of PcrP: Acp3 and PA3518. We show that PcrP is involved in oxidative stress responses in <i>Pa</i>, which are likely mediated by its interactions with Acp3, and may support its role in PMB resistance. In addition, PcrP imparts a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent growth advantage to <i>Pa</i> during P<sub>i</sub> starvation and plays a role in polyphosphate accumulation in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner. Overall, this study identified a novel protein-binding function for the PA2803 subfamily representative that mediates <i>Pa</i> responses to elevated Ca<sup>2+</sup> and P<sub>i</sub> starvation and enhances PMB resistance."

This retrospective study analyzed data from pLTX recipients aged ≤ 17 years between January 2019 and December 2023 from the China Lung Transplantation Registry. Pre-, intra-, and post-operative characteristics were described and compared between children aged 2-11 years and 12-17 years and between pLTX conducted in centers with high and low transplant volumes. The Kaplan‒Meier method was used to estimate the postoperative survival rates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). One-year postoperative survival rates were compared between pediatric and adult lung transplant (LTX) patients via log-rank tests. Between 2019 and 2023, 63 transplants were performed in 62 pediatric patients, accounting for 1.8% of the total LTX in China. The primary indication for pLTX was bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (46.0%), followed by cystic fibrosis (12.7%) and idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (11.1%). Infection was the most common complication after pLTX (63.9%), and the incidence of bronchial anastomotic stenosis was slightly higher among recipients aged 2-11 years than among those aged 12-17 years (14.3% vs. 2.9%, P = 0.244). High-volume hospitals had a higher incidence of infections (72.7% vs. 41.2%, P = 0.021) and primary graft failure (20.0% vs. 5.9%, P = 0.260) among pediatric recipients. However, acute rejection was exclusively observed in low-volume hospitals (0.0% vs. 17.6%, P = 0.018). The in-hospital mortality rate was 16.1% (95% CI = 6.7-25.5). The 30-day and one-year survival rates after pLTX were 93.5% (95% CI = 87.6-99.9) and 80.6% (95% CI = 71.4-91.1), respectively, and were significantly higher than those of adult recipients (82.0% and 58.7%, all P < 0.05). This research identified the trends, indications, donor and recipient characteristics, and complications of pLTX in China. Despite its small size, pLTX is growing gradually and has favorable outcomes. Future research on the long-term follow-up of pLTX recipients is needed to identify factors associated with the prognosis of pLTX patients."

    "abstract": "Real-world data demonstrate variability in the response to elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI) treatment among people with CF (pwCF). The aim of this study was to evaluate long-term outcomes in pwCF that had not shown early improvement in the percentage of predicted FEV<sub>1</sub> (ppFEV<sub>1</sub>) following ETI treatment. A single-center prospective study in pwCF who initiated ETI. Patients were categorized as 'early responders' if showing an improvement of at least 10 % in ppFEV<sub>1</sub> within three months of treatment or 'non-early responders' if not. Patients with pretreatment ppFEV<sub>1</sub> of above 99 % predicted were excluded. Respiratory and non-respiratory outcomes 18 to 24 months after ETI initiation were evaluated. A total of 52 pwCF (median age 30 (22-34), 22 (42 %) female) were included, of whom 21 (40 %) were 'non-early responders'. In a multivariable analysis, previous CFTR modulator therapy (p = 0.002), higher pretreatment ppFEV<sub>1</sub> (p = 0.002), and higher pretreatment BMI (p = 0.018), were negatively associated with early change in ppFEV<sub>1</sub>. After 18 to 24 months of ETI therapy, ppFEV<sub>1</sub> did not significantly improve in the 'non-early responders' group (p = 0.29). However, rates of ppFEV<sub>1</sub> decline (p < 0.001), BMI (p < 0.005), number of pulmonary exacerbations (p < 0.02), days of intravenous antibiotic treatment (p < 0.01), and chest CT scores (p < 0.05), all significantly improved in both patient groups. This study provides evidence for the long-term clinical benefits of ETI in pwCF lacking an early ppFEV<sub>1</sub> response. The data suggest that a lack of early improvement should not deter clinicians from treatment continuation."

    "abstract": "We investigate bronchopulmonary colonization patterns in Spanish people with CF (pwCF), gathering clinical, demographic, and microbiological data to supplement nine years of registry information, comparing 2021 findings with a similar multicenter study conducted in 2013. Sixteen CF units from 14 hospitals across Spain participated, each randomly recruiting around 20 patients. Patients provided sputum samples for culture. The clinical, demographical, microbiological, and treatment data from the previous year were recorded. Overall, 326 patients (48.5% females) were recruited: 185 adult and 141 pediatrics, with a median age [q3-q1] of 30 [38-24] and 12 [16-6] years, respectively. p.Phe508del mutation was present in 30.6% and 46.4% of patients with homozygosis or heterozygosis, respectively. Median FEV<sub>1</sub> (%) was significantly lower in adults (62%, range 75-43%) compared with pediatrics (90%, range 104-81%) (p<0.001). Pancreatic insufficiency was observed in 77.3%, carbohydrate metabolism alteration in 27.3%, and CF-related diabetes in 19.6% of patients. Lower prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization were noted compared to 2013, along with a significantly lower correlation in lung function among pwCF colonized by P. aeruginosa (p<0.001). Half of pwCF (51%) exhibited a single pathogen in culture, two in 30%, and three or more in 2.4%. Co-colonization of P. aeruginosa and S. aureus (36.1%) was the most prevalent combination. High resistance rates were observed in P. aeruginosa and methicillin resistant S. aureus isolates. We provide a valuable and representative current insight into the observed evolution in the clinical, demographic, and microbiological aspects in recent years among pwCF in Spain."

    "abstract": "The DNAJ/HSP40 family consists of three distinct subfamilies (DNAJA, DNAJB, and DNAJC) and is the largest and most diverse co-chaperone proteins for HSP70. The DNAJA subfamily, comprising four members, assumes a pivotal role in various pathological conditions such as cystic fibrosis, neurodegenerative disorders, and cancer. This review comprehensively investigates the participation and underlying mechanisms of DNAJA proteins in tumor proliferation and metastasis, with a specific focus on their influence on the accumulation of mutant p53 proteins. Furthermore, we conducted an extensive examination of compounds utilizing computer-based techniques that specifically target DNAJA or its associated pathways, thereby offering novel insights for the development of cutting-edge combination therapies in the realm of cancer treatment. Our findings highlight the potential significance of targeting the DNAJA subfamily as a promising approach for anti-tumor therapy. Simultaneously, we also highlighted the limitations of current DNAJA research and proposed future directions for advancement in this field. We anticipate that DNAJA will emerge as a novel therapeutic target for anti-tumor interventions."

    "abstract": "Asthma and obesity are both chronic diseases. Obesity is a common comorbidity and a risk factor of severe asthma, associated with increased asthma exacerbation risk, poorer asthma control and reduced quality of life. However, the responsible mechanisms are poorly understood. The aim of this study was to detect parameters associated with obesity in patients with severe asthma in order to check different pattern of inflammation in obese asthmatics. Baseline data from the Severe Asthma Network in Italy (SANI) registry were analysed in 1922 patients with severe asthma. Demographic, clinical and functional features were compared, according to body mass index (BMI). The prevalence of overweight and obesity among severe asthma patients was 34,8 and 20,3, respectively. Females were more prevalent in the obese cluster (p < 0.001). Asthma onset age in overweight and obese patients was higher than in normal population (p < 0.001). Obese subjects reported less frequently chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) and more frequently impaired sleep quality, cardiovascular disease, and type-2 diabetes (p < 0.001). Severe asthma patients with obesity had lower predicted FVC values (89.0 ± 19.2 vs 93.5 ± 20.2; p 0.002) and higher FEV1/FVC ratio (69.9 ± 11.5 vs 66.9 ± 12.4; p < 0.001) than patients without obesity. Obese asthmatics had lower blood eosinophilic count, and fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) levels than non-obese asthmatics. Asthma control test (ACT) was significantly poorer in obese patients (17, IQR 12-21) than other subgroups. Regarding treatment, overweight and obese patients were more likely to receive a GINA-Step 5 therapy (p 0.023), with more than 20 of obese asthmatics having frequent exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroid (OCS). Patients with severe asthma and obesity presented different characteristics that support the existence of distinct asthma phenotype in obese patients. Trial registry: ClinicalTrials.gov.

This article focuses on the outcome of a two-day multistakeholder workshop organized by EMA in 2024, which explored ways to optimize the EMA qualification procedure for patient registries, and to establish the value and enable the use of these data across the full spectrum of research questions. Key recommendations include the need to clarify the aim, scope, and added value of the qualification of registries, coupled with a review of the procedural steps to ensure the process is fit-for-purpose to evaluate the use of registries in specific regulatory contexts. Further recommendations focused on strengthening interactions between stakeholders, as well as providing them with enhanced support by increasing awareness of publicly available tools that could leverage the potential of registry data, together with existing guidance. The European Medicines Regulatory Network is now working together with all relevant stakeholders, including the EMA scientific committees and working parties, the Joint HMA/EMA Network Data Steering Group and existing focus groups with external partners, to implement concrete actions that will address these recommendations. Among others, the update of existing guidance, the development of templates and Questions & Answers documents, and the design of appropriate communication and stakeholder engagement plans will aid in achieving the common goal of making optimal use of patient registry data to support public health in the European Union."

This study aims to describe the fertility and family-building knowledge, experiences, and care utilization of this population and to compare these findings to the general United States (US) population. We conducted an anonymous cross-sectional study of self-reported survey data compared to data from the 2017-2019 US National Survey for Family Growth (NSFG). We recruited MwCF age 15 years and older at seven US cystic fibrosis (CF) centers. A total of 532 MwCF (mean age 35.3 ± 11.6 years) completed the survey. 83% knew that almost all MwCF are infertile and 84% were aware that MwCF can have biological children. 71% correctly identified the most common cause of male CF infertility. One third of MwCF stated they had never been told by anyone they were infertile due to their CF (mean age of discussion 19.3 ± 8.8 years). 31% reported being a parent. Among parents, 66% were a parent to a biological child born of a partner's pregnancy, 20% via step-parenthood, 15% adoption, 4.3% surrogacy, and 0.6% foster parenthood. Compared to 44% of NSFG males, 18% of MwCF age 15-49 years reported being a parent to a biological child born of their partner's pregnancy (p < 0.001). Among all MwCF, 82% with a biological child reported that they required medical assistance. Among those age 15-49 years, 87% of MwCF with a biological child required medical assistance compared to 9.4% of NSFG males (p < 0.001). Nearly three-quarters (73%) of MwCF who were biological parents underwent sperm retrieval via a variety of extraction techniques. 91% of those utilizing ART underwent in vitro fertilization and 9% intrauterine insemination of their partner. MwCF face significant disease-related fertility and family-building implications with suboptimal counseling. Most MwCF who are parents pursue biological parenthood via a variety of ART services, but one-third chose alternative paths to parenthood. Further research is needed to best understand and support the family-building of MwCF. Not applicable."

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in this clinical setting. In this descriptive retrospective monocentric cohort study, we collected data by using electronic medical records from all patients with CF who received ECMO therapy during the period 2012-2021. A monocentric setting at the non-surgical intensive care unit of the University Hospital of Frankfurt, Germany (tertiary care level center and nationally certified CF center). During the study period 72 cases of CF patients with intensive care treatment were detected. Of these, 46 cases required mechanical ventilation. Nine patients received ECMO therapy for severe respiratory failure due to pulmonary exacerbation. Eight of the nine patients died in the hospital. This corresponds to an in-hospital mortality rate of 88.9%. None of the patients underwent lung transplantation. The most common CF mutation was the p.Phe508del homo- or heterozygous genotype. Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization was significantly associated with the in-hospital mortality. ECMO support in CF patients and severe hypoxemic failure is associated with high mortality and its use must take into account the increased risk and poor patient outcome in this clinical setting. This was a retrospective, unregistered analysis. A clinical trial number is not applicable."

    "abstract": "Alpha-1 antitrypsin (A1AT) deficiency (AATD) is caused by a mutation in the SERPINA1 gene (PiZ allele), where misfolded A1AT liver accumulation leads to liver damage, and A1AT deficiency in the lungs results in emphysema due to unregulated neutrophil elastase activity. Base editing offers a potential cure for A1AT; however, effective treatment is hindered by the absence of dual-target delivery systems that can target key tissues. We developed Dual Selective ORgan-Targeting lipid nanoparticles (SORT LNPs) to deliver base editors to the liver and lungs. Dual SORT LNPs correct the PiZ mutation, achieving 40% correction editing in liver cells and 10% in lung AT2 cells. The liver maintains stable editing for 32 weeks, reducing Z-A1AT levels by over 80% and restoring a normal liver phenotype. In parallel, 89% neutrophil elastase inhibition is achieved in lung bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Taken together, Dual SORT LNP therapy offers a promising approach for long-lasting genome correction for multi-organ diseases such as AATD."

Tranexamic acid (TA), an antifibrinolytic agent, blocks the binding of plasminogen and plasmin to fibrin to inhibit clot breakdown. Despite its theoretical benefits, there is limited data on the use of inhaled TA for management of haemoptysis in CF. A 3-year retrospective audit of inhaled TA in CF patients with haemoptysis was conducted. Baseline demographics, hospitalisation status, haemoptysis volume, adverse events, adjuvant therapies and time to resolution of haemoptysis were extracted. We report on the safety and efficacy of nebulised TA, and outline our hospital-specific protocol for its use. Twenty-six adults [female, 12; age (yrs), 27.2 ± 3.1 95 % CI] with haemoptysis were trialled on nebulised TA, in addition to standard therapy. Nebulised TA was generally well tolerated; six patients reported chest tightness during dosing, which resolved in all cases with bronchodilators or a reduction in TA dose. In 65.4 % of cases, haemoptysis resolved within 48 h with TA use. A home haemoptysis management plan, with guidance for outpatient TA use was provided to 19 adults. Nebulised TA is a well-tolerated, non-invasive and inexpensive pharmacological option for in- and outpatient management of haemoptysis in CF. Our data support the use of TA to minimise further bleeding in CF outpatients, while waiting for further intervention from their CF service. However, first-dose trials should be supervised to assess for safety and side effects, and a personalised home haemoptysis management plan should be provided prior to use."

    "abstract": "Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is a complex inflammatory skin condition that significantly impacts patients' quality of life. Conventional treatments, such as antihistamines, often fail to provide adequate symptom control. The next step involves administering omalizumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting IgE, however, a subset of patients may not respond to this treatment underscoring the necessity for alternative treatment options. Remibrutinib, an oral, selective inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), has emerged as a promising therapy in CSU. BTK is vital for the activation of mast cells and basophils. The inhibitory action of remibrutinib on BTK may help alleviate CSU symptoms by addressing mast cell-mediated inflammation. Clinical trials, including Phase II and III studies, have shown promising efficacy and a favorable safety profile for remibrutinib in treating CSU. Patients experienced rapid symptom relief, with notable improvements in the Urticaria Activity Score (UAS7) concerning both itch intensity and the severity of hives. The safety profile was also commendable, with no significant treatment-related adverse events requiring therapy cessation or posing immediate health risks to patients. These results indicate that remibrutinib may become a preferred oral treatment for patients with moderate to severe CSU who do not adequately respond to standard therapies."

    "abstract": "Elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ELX/TEZ/IVA) was shown to be safe and efficacious in children 6 through 11 years of age with cystic fibrosis (CF) and at least one <i>F508del</i> allele in a 24-week phase 3 study. Children completing this study could enroll into a 192-week extension study. Evaluate long-term safety and efficacy of ELX/TEZ/IVA in children ≥6 years. In this 2-part (Part A [96-weeks] and Part B [96-weeks]) phase 3 extension study, children <12 years weighing <30 kg received ELX 100 mg once daily (qd)/TEZ 50 mg qd/IVA 75 mg every 12 hours (q12h) and children weighing ≥ 30 kg or aged ≥12 years received ELX 200 mg qd/TEZ 100 mg qd/IVA 150 mg q12h. Sixty-four children (<i>F</i>/MF [n=36] and <i>F/F</i> [n=28]) received ≥ 1 dose of ELX/TEZ/IVA. Mean exposure was 156.2 weeks and 60.9% of children (n=39) completed treatment in both parts of this 192-week study. The primary endpoint was safety. All children had adverse events (AEs), which for most were mild (31.3%) or moderate (64.1%) and generally consistent with common manifestations of CF. Two children (3.1%) had non-serious AEs that lead to treatment discontinuation (increased alanine aminotransferase [n=1] and aggression [n=1]). Secondary endpoints focused on efficacy. From parent study baseline, improvements were seen in ppFEV<sub>1</sub> (9.6 percentage points; 95% CI: 5.4, 13.7), sweat chloride concentration (-57.9 mmol/L; 95% CI: -63.3, -52.5), CFQ-R respiratory domain score (10.0 points; 95% CI: 6.9, 13.0), LCI<sub>2.5</sub> (-2.33; 95% CI: -2.87, -1.79), and BMI z-score (0.39; 95% CI: 0.19, 0.59) at Week 192. Rate of pulmonary exacerbations per year was 0.05. The annualized rate of change in ppFEV<sub>1</sub> and LCI<sub>2.5</sub> was -0.09 percentage points (95% CI: -1.01, 0.84) and -0.07 units (95%CI: -0.12, -0.01), respectively. In this 4-year extension study in children ≥6 years, the longest clinical trial experience with a CFTR modulator in this pediatric population, ELX/TEZ/IVA remained generally safe and well-tolerated with no new safety findings. Clinically meaningful improvements in lung function, CFTR function, and nutritional status reported in the parent study were maintained. These results confirm the long-term safety and efficacy of ELX/TEZ/IVA in children ≥6 years.

The objective of this study was to describe the experience of patient/family partners (PFPs) in a national QI collaborative and to develop recommendations for best practices for patient engagement. We conducted focus groups with PFPs in a national QI collaborative focused on improving transitions of care between cystic fibrosis (CF) and lung transplant programmes. Audio recordings were transcribed verbatim, coded inductively and analysed through thematic analysis. Member checking with PFPs, clinicians and team coaches was used to refine the findings and develop recommendations. Five PFPs participated in two focus groups, which revealed that PFPs (1) were motivated to participate as members of the QI team because they felt deeply connected to their CF care teams and wanted to help other patients, (2) felt engaged in the QI collaborative and appreciated the sense of community, support from the team coach and the opportunity to take ownership of projects, and (3) suggested improvements related to timing of meetings, compensation, being mindful when discussing sensitive information and setting clear expectations. Member checking revealed the need for equitable recruitment processes and tailoring the role to the individual participants. The findings were used to develop and change processes in the collaborative. The structure of the national QI collaborative supported patient/family partnership through structured meetings and a focus on building relationships of mutual respect. The findings demonstrated the need for a more equitable recruitment process, better expectation setting and customisation of the role to the individual skills, needs and preferences of the participants. Patients and family members of people living with CF participated in this study through focus groups and member checking.

    "title": "ENaC contributes to macrophage dysfunction in cystic fibrosis.",
    "abstract": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a chronic disease caused by dysfunctional or absent cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). CFTR is expressed in immune cells and regulates innate immunity, both directly and indirectly. The epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) contributes to dysfunction in CF airway epithelial cells. However, the impact of non-CFTR ion channel dysfunction on CF immune responses is not understood. Improved understanding of how immune function is regulated by ion channels may allow antibiotic- and mutation-agnostic treatment approaches to chronic infection and inflammation. Therefore, we hypothesized that ENaC is aberrantly expressed in CF macrophages and directly contributes to impaired phagocytic and inflammatory functions. ENaC expression was characterized in immune cells isolated from CF and non-CF blood donors. Monocyte-derived macrophage (MDM) function and bacterial killing were tested with ENaC modulation. Baseline ENaC expression in human CF MDMs, lymphocytes, and granulocytes was increased at both the transcript and protein level relative to non-CF and persisted after infection. CFTR inhibition in non-CF MDMs resulted in ENaC overexpression. CFTR modulator treatment reduced but did not eliminate ENaC overexpression in CF MDMs. Interestingly, ENaC inhibition increased CFTR expression. Amiloride-treated CF MDMs also showed normalized reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, improved autophagy, and decreased proinflammatory cytokine production. Sodium channel expression in CF MDMs normalized after amiloride treatment with minimal effect on other ion channels. In summary, ENaC modulation in immune cells is a novel potential therapeutic target for CF infection control, either in combination with CFTR modulators, or as a sole agent for people not eligible for CFTR modulators.<b>NEW & NOTEWORTHY</b> New research reveals that epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) overexpression in cystic fibrosis (CF) immune cells impairs macrophage function. Inhibiting ENaC increases cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) expression, normalizes reactive oxygen species production, improves autophagy, and reduces proinflammatory cytokine production. This suggests that ENaC modulation could be a novel therapeutic target for CF infection control, either alone or with CFTR modulators, offering new hope for patients not eligible for current treatments."

Despite its immunoregulatory potential, data on extracorporeal photopheresis as an induction therapy remain rather limited. We conducted a pilot randomized controlled study on ECP as induction therapy in cystic fibrosis patients undergoing primary lung transplantation. Primary endpoints included safety, assessed based on the incidence of adverse events, treatment-related toxicity, and procedure-related complication rates; and feasibility, evaluated through the completion rate of scheduled ECP sessions, patient tolerability, and treatment discontinuation rates. Secondary endpoint consisted of an exploratory assessment of efficacy, using a composite measure that included three key components: freedom from biopsy-proven acute rejection within the first 12 months, absence of chronic lung allograft dysfunction at 36 months, and optimal graft function, defined as a predicted forced expiratory volume in the first second ≥ 90% at 36 months. Finally, exploratory endpoints included cell phenotypic and functional analyses, secreted immune protein profiling, and gene expression analysis for mechanistic insights. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either standard immunosuppressive therapy alone or standard therapy plus six sessions of extracorporeal photopheresis, with a follow-up period of 36 months. Among 36 cystic fibrosis patients who underwent lung transplantation between 2018 and 2021 and met the eligibility criteria, 21 were randomized (9 to the study group and 12 to the control group). No patients in the treatment group experienced adverse events. The enrollment rate was 61%, and the treatment discontinuation rate was 22%. The clinical composite endpoint was achieved by 28.6% of patients in the treatment group and 16.7% in the control group. Exploratory endpoint analyses revealed significant decreases in pro-inflammatory cytokines, degranulating CD8<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes, and NK cells in the treatment group. Moreover, significant increases in Treg lymphocytes, IL-10-producing NK cells, and anti-inflammatory cytokines appeared to be associated with improved pulmonary function in the treatment group. Induction therapy with extracorporeal photopheresis is safe and feasible in lung transplantation for cystic fibrosis. Some clinical benefits appear to persist for the first 36 months of follow-up. Interestingly, a correlation between immunological modulation induced by extracorporeal photopheresis and pulmonary function was observed. https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03500575?cond=NCT03500575&rank=1, identifier NCT03500575."

    "abstract": "Chronic airway inflammatory diseases mainly comprise chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), allergic rhinitis (AR), asthma, cystic fibrosis (CF), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Epithelial cells fulfill a protective role as a barrier; however, when stimulated, these cells also release a variety of cytokines that attract and activate immune cells, including macrophages, neutrophils, and T-lymphocytes. Excessive activation and aggregation of immune cells disrupts the balance of the cellular microenvironment, and leads to impaired immune defense of the airway mucosa, which can further exacerbate an inflammatory response. In this article, we discuss the key cytokines and immune pathways involved in epithelial-immune cell interactions, and we detail discoveries in the emerging field of single-cell sequencing and summarize monoclonal antibody-targeted therapies. A comprehensive search was conducted using the search terms 'epithelial cell,' 'immune,' 'interaction,' 'cytokines,' 'asthma,' 'chronic sinusitis,' 'allergic rhinitis,' 'monoclonal antibodies,' and 'single-cell sequencing' by querying Google Scholar and PubMed. The intricate pathophysiology of airway inflammation remains to be fully elucidated. Emerging technologies, such as single-cell sequencing, have led to a more comprehensive characterization of the immune mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of airway inflammatory diseases, which points the way to further precision medicine in the future."

    "abstract": "The use of bacteriophage (phage) to treat bacterial infection of airways in persons with cystic fibrosis (CF) is gaining interest. However, phenotypic diversification of bacteria during chronic airway infection presents a potential challenge to this therapy. We recovered and subcultured two or three Burkholderia colonies from each of 12 CF sputum samples. All isolates were tested for their susceptibility to a panel of 65 Burkholderia-targeting phages. We observed that 9 (75%) of the 12 colony sets comprised mixtures of isolates that were sensitive or resistant to one or more of the phages tested. The occurrence of mixed populations of phage-sensitive and phage-resistant Burkholderia in individuals with CF needs to be considered in the development of phage therapy for this patient population."

    "abstract": "Acute cellular rejection is a key contributor to chronic lung allograft dysfunction following transplantation; while treatable, traditional immunosuppressive therapies are associated with significant side effects. Gene therapy offers an approach to modulate recipient immune responses while minimizing the toxicity of conventional immunosuppressive therapy. In this study, we evaluated adenoassociated virus (AAV)-mediated programmed death-ligand (PD-L)1 overexpression, an inhibitory ligand of T cells, in a rat single-lung transplant model. Allogeneic Brown Norway lungs were transplanted into Fischer F344 recipients and assigned to 3 groups: (1) AAV9-PD-L1 via the bronchus during static cold storage, (2) no-virus control, or (3) AAV9-luciferase control. All animals received cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 immunoglobulin on postoperative day (POD)1, and killed on POD14. Rejection was evaluated by a blinded lung transplant pathologist, and PD-L1 expression and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell infiltration assessed via immunohistochemistry. By POD14, the AAV9-PD-L1 group displayed significantly reduced rejection severity (mean score 1.40) compared to controls (mean 3.60; p=0.005). The AAV9-luciferase group exhibited comparable rejection scores to no-virus controls (mean 3.5). Immunohistochemistry confirmed exogenous PD-L1 expression, however no significant difference in CD8+ T cell count was observed between groups. These findings demonstrate that AAV-PD-L1 gene delivery can attenuate acute cellular rejection in lung transplants, offering a potential strategy to improve outcomes."

    "abstract": "Individuals living with rare diseases have conventionally been understood as being particularly vulnerable, which often promotes a negative and stigmatising interpretation of vulnerability. In this article, we embrace the framework of structural (health) vulnerability to gain a deeper understanding of the circumstances and factors contributing to adverse outcomes in the specific context of a Global South country, India, and a particular rare disease, Cystic Fibrosis (CF). By drawing on published materials and preliminary data from an evolving ethnographic research project, we contend that it is crucial to examine global power dynamics and the unequal distribution of resources to contextualize the precarious conditions experienced by Indians living with CF. Epistemologically, this stems from pervasive racialised assumptions ingrained in CF knowledge production, constituting a form of hermeneutic injustice, while economically, India's position in the global bioeconomy restricts access to potentially beneficial treatments derived from advanced clinical research. Moreover, reduced investment in healthcare by the Indian Central Government, notably evident in its rare disease policy, leaves CF patients reliant on philanthropy, which is susceptible to shifting interests and priorities. Therefore, we argue that focusing on structural (health) vulnerability is essential for shedding light on the distinct challenges faced by individuals living with CF in India, as well as in other locations in the Global South."

This analysis is part of the Qualitative Understanding of the Experience of SIMPLIFY Trial (QUEST), a qualitative companion study to a discontinuation trial of two commonly prescribed medications for people with CF. We interviewed 109 total individuals (87 people with CF and 22 caregivers). The interviews were analyzed to explore the influence of participation in a discontinuation study on clinical conversations. Respect emerged as an overarching theme of these interviews: how much the interviewees respected their clinicians and how they appreciated having their autonomy respected too. Other desirable attributes of clinical conversations surfaced including the importance of reciprocity, empowerment, sensitivity, partnership, empathy, consideration and transparency; (R.E.S.P.E.C.T). Communication is a fundamental aspect of chronic disease management. This population study focused on patient perspectives of clinical conversations after sharing the experience of being in a novel discontinuation study. Since the acronym R.E.S.P.E.C.T. emerged from the data, we believe it has value as a framework for clinical conversations with people who have chronic conditions that require active selfmanagement."

    "abstract": "Cryo-electron microscopy has yielded high-resolution structural data of the multidrug efflux transporter P-glycoprotein (ABCB1), but its direct and indirect interactions within the native membrane environment have remained largely unexplored. Here, we compared the fluidity gradients of plasma membranes of the drug-sensitive CHO cell line AuxB1 and its P-glycoprotein overexpressing derivative B30 by fluorescence anisotropy of embedded n-(9-anthroyloxy) fatty acid probes (n = 2, 7, 9, 12, 16) in the temperature range of 10-50 °C. The shape of the temperature profiles of probe mobility was comparable in AuxB1 and B30 membranes, but did not match. Overexpression of P-glycoprotein smoothened the transversal gradient of the out-of-plane mode of rotation of the probes, which may facilitate the partitioning of hydrophobic drugs into the membrane and thereby increase the speed of P-glycoprotein to pump the drug out of the cell."

    "abstract": "Despite significant clinical improvements, there is evidence of persisting airway inflammation in people with cystic fibrosis (CF) established on elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI) therapy. As CF is a multi-system disease, systemic immune profiles can reflect local inflammation within the lungs and other organs. Understanding systemic inflammation after ETI therapy may reveal important translational insights. This study aims to profile systemic inflammatory changes and relate these to the well-documented improvements observed with ETI therapy. We conducted a single-centre longitudinal study with 57 CF subjects initiating ETI therapy. All participants were Phe508del homozygous or Phe508del/minimal function. Blood samples were collected pre-ETI and 3-12 months post-therapy initiation. Analyses included mass spectrometry-based proteomics, a multiplex immunoassay, and flow cytometry for peripheral immune cell counts and phenotype. Controls samples were provided by 29 age-matched healthy controls. Systemic inflammation reduced with ETI therapy; however, the immune profile remained distinct from healthy controls. ETI reduced neutrophil counts and was associated with a more mature, less inflammatory phenotype, as well as a shift towards an immune resolving state associated with increased CD206 expression. Cytokines known to influence neutrophil levels reduced with therapy. Despite ETI therapy, neutrophil and monocyte counts remained elevated compared with healthy controls. There was no obvious association between the ETI-related improvements in systemic inflammation and lung function. Patients with CF showed evidence of persisting systemic inflammation despite ETI therapy, which may have long-term potentially adverse effects on respiratory and other organ systems."

    "title": "Towards a universal size distribution in a polymer network. Implications for drug delivery and plasmonic nanoparticle transport phenomena in polysaccharide and synthetic hydrogels.",
    "abstract": "Polymeric hydrogels are paramount to outstanding applications in materials science, biology, medicine, pharmacy. Their similarity to living tissues is leveraged in clinical branches (oncology, cardiology, immunology, neurology, wound healing) for delivering a large range of drugs (encompassing DNA, RNA, protein molecules) and realizing in-vivo models of stimuli-responsive or controlled drug release. Rubber elasticity theory and the swollen network hypothesis are key for properly designing the geometric and mechanical features of hydrogels and polymer networks. The assumption of a Gaussian distribution of end-to-end lengths in a polymer molecule, however, can break down in several cases. Here, strongly supported by Low field NMR and rheology experiments, we propound the generalized Weibull law of extreme value statistics (EVS) to have universal validity in hydrogel materials. Mesh size values that account for an intrinsic statistical dependence between monomeric positions (or stiffness) show much better agreement with measurements conducted on physically crosslinked samples (agar, alginate and scleroglucan), including sputum specimens (rich in mucins) from patients affected by chronic respiratory conditions (cystic fibrosis) and on chemically crosslinked samples (poly-vinylpyrrolidone, PVP; poly-(ethylene-glycol/propylene-glycol), PEG/PPG). Across all ten gels, the Gaussian distribution yields the smallest average mesh size, ranging roughly from 7 nm for the densest alginate 2 % (9 gL<sup>-1</sup>) hydrogel to about 80 nm for one of the sputum. Working with the pierced Gaussian inflates the mesh size to ≈1.5 × the Gaussian value, with increases from a modest +4 % in alginate 1 % up to nearly +100 % in the open PVP network (48 → 98 nm). The generalized Weibull distribution usually falls between the two Gaussians, yet in agar 1 % and scleroglucan 2 % it overtakes the pierced Gaussian (e.g. 20.2 > 15.8 nm for agar 1 %), reflecting a strong heavy-tailed distribution. The predicted mesh order therefore is Gaussian < generalized Weibull ≈ pierced Gaussian, with the precise ranking ruled by the width and skewness of each network statistics. Overall, our findings - being straightforward to apply - will profoundly impact on the description, conception and control of polymer networks, which often demand advanced instrumental techniques for compensating the lack of adequate predictive models. Among other relevant implications, aside from drug delivery, we highlight the characterization of the photothermal (or thermoplasmonic) response of hydrogel matrices hosting metal nanoparticles (e.g. with applications in hyperthermia cancer treatment and enhanced chemical processes). On the theoretical side, we emphasize the study of transport and thermomechanical properties of polymeric networks."

    "abstract": "Mycobacterium abscessus (MAB) is a clinically significant multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogen, particularly implicated in pulmonary infections among cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. Tedizolid (TZD), an oxazolidinone-class antibacterial drug, has been recommended as an alternative treatment for MAB-infected patients who are intolerant to or whose isolate is resistant to first-line drugs including linezolid (LZD). To investigate the TZD resistance mechanisms in MAB, we isolated 23 TZD-resistant MAB mutants and performed whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to identify resistance-associated genes. Frequent mutations were identified in MAB_2885, encoding a putative TetR transcriptional regulator, and MAB_2303, encoding a putative mycobacterial membrane protein large (MmpL). Drug susceptibility testing confirmed that MAB_2885 mutations contribute to both TZD and LZD resistance in MAB. RNA-seq analysis revealed that restoring wild-type MAB_2885 in mutants downregulated the MAB_2302-MAB_2303. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) showed the MAB_2885 protein binds to its target sequence upstream of MAB_2302-MAB_2303, further confirming their regulatory relationship. The W91R mutation in the MAB_2885 protein was found to impair its DNA-binding activity compared to the wild-type. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis confirmed that MAB_2302-MAB_2303 functions as a TZD efflux pump. Additionally, overexpression of MAB_2885 in M. abscessus subsp. bolletii and M. abscessus subsp. massiliense also increased their TZD susceptibility and downregulated their respective MmpS-MmpL orthologs. Overall, our study demonstrates that mutations in MAB_ 2885 contribute to TZD and LZD resistance by disrupting the negative regulation of the downstream MAB_2302-MAB_2303, which functions as a direct efflux pump for TZD. These findings provide new insights into oxazolidinone resistance mechanisms in MAB and identify potential biomarkers for detecting drug resistance."

However, various physiological barriers in the lungs, such as mucociliary clearance, macrophage phagocytosis, and lung surfactant interference, present challenges for efficient mRNA delivery. Polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) have emerged as a therapeutic platform for delivering mRNA therapeutics due to their stability, tunability, and controlled release properties, making them suitable and potentially ideal for encapsulating and protecting mRNA molecules for delivery <i>in vivo</i>. Continued advances in polymer and NP design have improved mucus penetration and cellular uptake upon lung delivery; further, administration via local and systemic routes enable modulation of NP biodistribution. These advancements benefit the potential treatment of a range of pulmonary diseases, including viral infections, cystic fibrosis (CF), asthma, and lung cancer, by facilitating immune modulation and genetic therapy delivery. In this review, we explore how polymeric NPs address disease-specific requirements and physiological challenges to expand the potential for therapeutic mRNAs in the lung."

Persons with cystic fibrosis (CF) often suffer from chronic infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic pathogen. However, the relative abundance of P. aeruginosa is not associated with the onset of increased pulmonary symptoms, known as a pulmonary exacerbation. We hypothesized that the cargo of P. aeruginosa EVs is different at times of baseline wellness and pulmonary exacerbation onset in persons with CF. This is the first study to characterize and compare P. aeruginosa EVs at these two time points, using a novel series of steps to isolate the P. aeruginosa EVs directly from the sputum of persons with CF. Our study found a differential packaging of P. aeruginosa proteins at baseline wellness and pulmonary exacerbation, with six proteins being more frequently present in pulmonary exacerbation samples. Additionally, we were able to demonstrate the P. aeruginosa EVs isolated from the sputum of persons with CF at the time of pulmonary exacerbation induced an inflammatory response in CF human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells. These data, while preliminary, support the clinical relevance of P. aeruginosa EVs in influencing gene regulation and lung inflammation and immunity in persons with CF."

Metrics such as time above range >140 mg/dL could indicate progression risk, and artificial intelligence (AI)-based modeling may enhance predictive capabilities. Further research is needed to establish CGM-based diagnostic criteria and refine screening strategies to improve T1D detection and intervention."

In recent years, it has been found that the molecular structure of calcium activated chloride ion channels, transmenbrane protein 16A（TMEM16A）, is closely related to airway mucus hypersecretion.TMEM16A not only mediates ion transepithelial transport and hydration, but also participates in the regulation of mucin secretion. TMEM16A is highly expressed in airway epithelium of a variety of inflammatory diseases of upper and lower airway, such as asthma, cystic fibrosis, allergic rhinitis, chronic sinusitis and so on. Understanding the expression level and regulation mechanism of TMEM16A in different airway diseases and revealing its physiological function and pathological mechanism is critical for targeted disease treatment. This paper summarizes the research status of the discovery process, structural characteristics and regulatory mechanism of TMEM16A, and then summarizes the expression level of TMEM16A in asthma, cystic fibrosis, allergic rhinitis and chronic sinusitis ant related pathological mechanisms, clarifies the potential value of TMEM16A as a therapeutic target for the above four diseases, in order to guide treatment of airway inflammatory diseases."

It can affect multiple organ systems, often mimicking malignancies or infections. Skull base involvement in IgG4-RD is uncommon and presents diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. We present three topographically distinct areas of skull base involvement patterns in IgG4-RD. This case series describes three patients with IgG4-RD affecting distinct skull base regions. The first case involves a 57-year-old female presenting with chief complaint of headache, sudden deterioration of vision in the right eye over the past two months, with ptosis and saddle nose deformity. Imaging revealed a heterogeneous multiloculated cystic lesion in intraconal compartment of right orbital apex with polypoidal mucosal thickening in ethmoid and sphenoid sinus. Biopsy done from posterior ethmoid and sphenoid mass confirmed IgG4-RD. The patient improved with corticosteroid therapy. The second case is a 50-year-old male with right-sided ear pain, decreased hearing, hoarseness of voice and facial nerve palsy for 3 months. Imaging showed a heterogeneous, enhancing soft tissue lesion involving right parotid, carotid, masticator, parapharyngeal and pharyngeal mucosal space with few lytic lesions involving petrous part of right temporal bone with adjacent sclerosis. Biopsy from nasopharynx confirmed IgG4-RD and corticosteroid therapy led to clinical improvement. Our third case is a 60-year-old male with IgG4-RD Oof nasopharynx, nasal obstruction and discharge for 3 months. Imaging revealed an ill defined soft tissue thickening in nasopharynx, bilateral Fossa of Rosenmuller and disease spreading to clivus. Biopsy from nasopharynx confirmed the diagnosis and patient started on oral corticosteroids, initially improved but the disease progressed, leading to multiorgan failure and death. These cases highlight the diverse clinical presentations and outcomes of IgG4-RD involving the skull base. Early diagnosis through histopathology and initiation of corticosteroid therapy is critical for improving outcomes. However, refractory cases may require immunosupressive therapies."

Its genetic tractability has advanced the understanding of complex regulatory networks and experimental evolution.

P. aeruginosa can cause acute and chronic human infections, particularly in patients with underlying immune deficiencies. Its intrinsic antibiotic tolerance and resistance, together with its ability to produce multiple virulence factors while rapidly adapting to infection conditions, pose a major clinical challenge. In this Review, we explore key features contributing to the ecological and pathogenic versatility of P. aeruginosa. We examine the molecular mechanisms and ecological and evolutionary implications of quorum sensing and biofilm formation. We explore the virulence strategies and in vivo fitness determinants, as well as the evolutionary dynamics and global epidemiology of P. aeruginosa, with a focus on antimicrobial resistance.

We retrospectively analysed food anaphylaxis cases recorded by the French-speaking Allergy-Vigilance Network (2002-2021) and compared the main characteristics of grade 3 (Ring classification) and grade 4 cases using univariate and multivariate statistical analyses. Of the 2621 food anaphylaxis cases reported, 731 (27.9%) were considered severe (grade 3, n = 687 [94%] and grade 4, n = 44 [6%]; 19 deaths). Overall, 56.1% of cases were adults (mean age: 28.3 years) and 53.7% were male. The most frequent triggers were peanut (13.9%), wheat (9.4%), cashew (5.8%), shrimp (5.3%), and cow's milk (4.6%). More grade 4 anaphylaxis cases occurred in children than in adults (26 vs. 18; p = 0.01).

Their excessive growth and biofilm formation in the respiratory tract increase the morbidity and mortality of inflammatory airway diseases in humans, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma and cystic fibrosis (CF). In horses, severe equine asthma (SEA) has many parallels to these human diseases. We hypothesized that QS molecules associated with the most common biofilm-forming lung pathogens in humans (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia) may also be present in the lungs of horses with SEA. Samples of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALf) were taken from twenty horses with exacerbated SEA. Microbiological cultures of the BALf samples were performed. Liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry was used to identify C4-HSL, C6-HSL, 3-oxo-C12-HSL and 11-methyl-2-dodecenoic acid, which are associated with the QS mechanisms of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Stenotrophomonas maltophilia was identified in three horses. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was not identified in any sample. The quorum sensing molecules C4-HSL, C6-HSL, 3-oxo-C12-HSL associated with biofilm formation by P. aeruginosa and 11-methyl-2-dodecenoic acid associated with biofilm formation by S. maltophila were not detected.

    "abstract": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a life-limiting genetic disease that affects multiple organ systems. It is caused by a mutation of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, which results in the absence or damage of a relevant protein. If left untreated, it causes death in early childhood. The advent of more efficacious treatments has resulted in a notable increase in the life expectancy of CF patients. This has, in turn, led to an elevated risk of developing specific types of cancer. This review commences with an examination of CF from the standpoint of its etiology and therapeutic modalities. Subsequently, it presents a list of epidemiological studies that suggest an altered predisposition to certain cancers. A heightened risk is well documented, particularly in relation to the gastrointestinal tract. The following section addresses the role of CFTR in view of its potential involvement in the progression of various types of cancer. Several studies have indicated that the levels of the CFTR protein are reduced in many tumors and that this reduction is associated with the progression of the tumors. These decreased expressions are known to occur in the gastrointestinal tract, lungs, bladder, and/or prostate cancer. Conversely, ovarian, stomach, and cervical cancer are connected with its higher expression. The final section of the review focuses on the molecular mechanism of action of the CFTR protein in signaling pathways that affect cell proliferation and the process of carcinogenesis. This section attempts to explain the increased predisposition to cancer observed in patients with CF."

Current therapies involving double or triple antibiotic combinations can rarely eradicate the pathogen in chronically infected patients owing to its intrinsic resistance to a variety of antibiotics. Herein, we show that a bismuth drug (and related compounds) could inhibit the growth of clinically antibiotic-resistant Bcc strains, with MIC (<i>ca.</i> 25 μg mL<sup>-1</sup>) comparable to that for <i>Helicobacter pylori</i>, and the combination of a bismuth drug and antibiotics also demonstrated excellent activity against biofilm and persisters of Bcc. Importantly, the <i>in vitro</i> antimicrobial activity of a bismuth drug could be well translated into <i>in vivo</i> evidenced by about 50% survival rates in the <i>Galleria mellonella</i> infection model. Transcriptomics analysis shows the dynamic responses of Bcc to bismuth treatment. Using a homemade metalloproteomic approach, we could identify 26 Bi<sup>III</sup>-binding proteins (15 cytosolic proteins and 11 membrane proteins). Further mechanistic studies reveal that bismuth drugs initially target the TCA cycle through the binding and inactivation of a series of enzymes including malate dehydrogenase (MDH), malate synthase (AceB), and succinyl coenzyme A synthetase (SCS), then interfere oxidative phosphorylation through binding to terminal oxidases, <i>i.e.</i>, CyoC and CydA, to disrupt electron transport chain, eventually, disrupt protein translation and ribosome <i>via</i> binding and down-regulation of key proteins.

In this study, we show that visible light centered around 425 nm inactivates each of the five SARS-CoV-2 VOC lineages that have been identified by the World Health Organization (Alpha, Beta, Delta, Gamma, and Omicron) in cell-free suspensions in a dose-dependent manner, including bamlanivimab-resistant variants. Specifically, 60 J/cm<sup>2</sup> of 425 nm light reduced SARS-CoV-2 titers by >4 log<sub>10</sub> relative to unilluminated controls. We observed that 425 nm light inactivates SARS-CoV-2 through restricted entry to host cells. In addition, a non-cytotoxic dosing regimen of 32 J/cm<sup>2</sup> of 425 nm light reduced infectious virus titers in well-differentiated air-liquid interface (ALI) human airway epithelial (HAE) cells infected with the Beta, Delta, and Omicron variants that incorporate mutations associated with immune evasion and/or increased transmissibility. Infectious SARS-CoV-2 titers were reduced when dosing began during the early stages of infection or in more established infections. Finally, we translated these findings to the RD-X19, a novel medical device that emits 425 nm light; our results showed that the RD-X19 restricted spike binding to ACE-2 and reduced SARS-CoV-2 titers in cell-free suspensions (by >2 log<sub>10</sub>) and in the ALI HAE model (by >1 log<sub>10</sub>). These findings indicate that photomedicine utilizing 425 nm visible light may serve as a novel, pan-variant treatment modality for COVID-19.<b>IMPORTANCE</b>The continued spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to the emergence of variants that can evade public health measures, including vaccines and therapeutics. Thus, the continued development of broadly applicable measures to supplement current public health measures and standards of care remains critical. Photomedicine is one such approach. In this study, we show that non-ultraviolet visible light can inactivate each SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern (VOC) by preventing entry to host cells. Furthermore, visible light reduced the amount of virus produced in an infection model of the human airway at multiple stages of infection, demonstrating the antiviral capability of visible light. This study provides preclinical support for the development of visible light to serve as a SARS-CoV-2 countermeasure and warrants further investigation."

    "title": "Exploring the role of microbiome in cystic fibrosis clinical outcomes through a mediation analysis.",
    "abstract": "Human microbiome plays a crucial role in host health and disease by mediating the impact of environmental factors on clinical outcomes. Mediation analysis is a valuable tool for dissecting these complex relationships. However, existing approaches are primarily designed for cross-sectional studies. Modern clinical research increasingly utilizes long follow-up periods, leading to complex data structures, particularly in metagenomic studies. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel mediation framework based on structural equation modeling that leverages linear mixed-effects models using penalized quasi-likelihood estimation with a debiased lasso. We applied this framework to a 16S rRNA sputum microbiome data set collected from patients with cystic fibrosis over 10 years to investigate the mediating role of the microbiome in the relationship between clinical states, disease aggressiveness phenotypes, and lung function. We identified richness as a key mediator of lung function. Specifically, <i>Streptococcus</i> was found to be significantly associated with mediating the decline in lung function on treatment compared to exacerbation, while <i>Gemella</i> was associated with the decline in lung function on recovery. This approach offers a powerful new tool for understanding the complex interplay between microbiome and clinical outcomes in longitudinal studies, facilitating targeted microbiome-based interventions. Understanding the mechanisms by which the microbiome influences clinical outcomes is paramount for realizing the full potential of microbiome-based medicine, including diagnostics and therapeutics. Identifying specific microbial mediators not only reveals potential targets for novel therapies and drug repurposing but also offers a more precise approach to patient stratification and personalized interventions. While traditional mediation analyses are ill-equipped to address the complexities of longitudinal metagenomic data, our framework directly addresses this gap, enabling robust investigation of these increasingly common study designs. By applying this framework to a decade-long cystic fibrosis study, we have begun to unravel the intricate relationships between the sputum microbiome and lung function decline across different clinical states, yielding insights that were previously unknown."

    "abstract": "People with cystic fibrosis (pwCF) are increasingly considering their reproductive options. Currently, there are many genetic testing options available for pwCF and their reproductive partners. Healthcare providers, including genetic counselors, can educate pwCF about these options and support them through the decision-making process. This study explored the role of genetics in the reproductive decisions of pwCF and their perspectives and experiences surrounding prenatal and preconception genetic counseling and testing. We conducted a qualitative study of a national US sample of pwCF age ⩾18 years recruited from the CF Foundation Community Voice platform. We conducted and recorded semi-structured telephone interviews with participants. We utilized Dedoose software and applied inductive thematic analysis to code the interview transcripts and elicit themes. We interviewed 21 participants (76.2% women, 95.2% White, 4.8% Hispanic, 57.1% parents, 23.8% considering parenthood). Key themes included: (1) pwCF appeared to understand the genetics of CF and were typically first introduced to CF genetics by CF providers, school, or their parents; (2) pwCF had diverse perspectives on having a child with CF; (3) carrier testing was an important consideration for some participants when making decisions about biological parenthood; (4) participants understood the role of genetic counselors and valued their knowledge, but only half previously met with a genetic counselor; (5) pwCF believed genetics information should be presented during childhood/adolescence and reinforced when interested in family planning. pwCF have discrepant views on passing on CF to future offspring, and although there is recognition of the role of genetic counseling and a desire for knowledge from genetic testing, genetic considerations are but one factor involved in parenthood decisions. Future work should develop patient-, provider-, or system-based interventions to best integrate high-quality genetics and genetic counseling care into the CF team for those with CF considering parenthood."

    "abstract": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by <i>CFTR</i> gene mutations. Its diagnosis mainly depends on genetic and sweat chloride tests, but the complexity of these mutations challenges diagnosis. This paper reports a new case of a Chinese child with cough and wheezing, suspected of having CF. Trio whole-exome sequencing for the pedigree was carried out to detect <i>CFTR</i> gene mutations. Five tools, namely Mutation Taster, PolyPhen-2, SIFT, FATHMM, and PROVEAN, were used to predict the impacts of mutations on protein function. AlphaFold was employed to predict protein structures, and GROMACS software was used to conduct stability analysis through molecular dynamics simulations. The child was diagnosed with severe pneumonia, plastic bronchitis, and acute asthmatic bronchitis, with a high suspicion of CF. Whole-exome sequencing revealed compound missense mutations in the <i>CFTR</i> gene: c.1408 (exon 11) G>A (p.V470M) and c.650 (exon 6) A>G (p.E217G), both of which were homozygous mutations. Parental genetic tests showed that the father was heterozygous for the mutations, and the mother was heterozygous at the c.650 (exon 6) A>G locus and homozygous at the c.1408 (exon 11) G>A locus. The results obtained by different prediction tools varied, and molecular dynamics simulations indicated that these mutations significantly affected the stability of the CFTR protein. Analysis of this new case using multiple tools and computational chemistry simulations helps to further understand the impacts of mutations on CFTR protein function and the disease, offering novel insights into the diagnosis, treatment, and genetic counseling of CF caused by the complex and diverse mutations of the <i>CFTR</i> gene."

    "abstract": "In the present review, simple approaches for the screening and characterization of natural compound agents that alter pro-inflammatory gene expression are described, with a particular focus on aged garlic extract (AGE), which has been the subject of several investigations that have supported its potential application as an anti-inflammatory agent. Additionally, evidence regarding the possible effects and mechanisms of action of two major AGE components, S-allyl cysteine (SAC) and S-1-propenyl-l-cysteine (S1PC), is reviewed. The proposed molecular targets of SAC and S1PC are IKKβ kinase, the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1-nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 complex, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ, histone deacetylase and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). Targeting these molecules causes a marked reduction in NF-κB activity accompanied by a notable decrease in the transcription of NF-κB-regulated genes. Another main objective of the present review was to discuss the possibility that AGE and its bioactive components could be employed in the treatment of several human pathologies that are characterized by a hyperinflammatory state resulting from dysregulation of the TLR4 and NF-κB pathways. SAC is of interest in the treatment of lung pathologies, neurological diseases, osteoarthritis, muscular atrophy, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and cancer. Additionally, the anti-oxidative activities of AGE, SAC and S1PC are compatible with their employment in the treatment of diseases characterized by oxidative stress, such as sickle cell disease and β-thalassemia."

    "abstract": "The triple cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators combination elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI) has been approved for people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF) bearing at least one <i>F508del</i> allele. Despite the development of CFTR modulators having dramatically improved respiratory outcomes in pwCF, clinical studies have showed variable responses to this drug formulation. Of note, airway inflammation and bacterial colonisation persist in the upper and lower respiratory tract even in ETI-treated patients. We first tested the clinical exoproducts (EXO) of <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> isolated from 15 CF patients in wild-type (WT) and F508del-CFTR CF bronchial epithelial (CFBE) cells. We were then prompted to evaluate the effects of EXO in <i>ex-vivo</i> patient-derived tissues. Therefore, we cultured primary nasal epithelial cells (HNECs) with EXO isolated from the corresponding pwCF to mimic the native status of CF airway. We found that EXO variably decreased WT-, F508del- and ETI-dependent F508del-CFTR function and increased proinflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in a clinical strain-specific manner. Similarly, we observed a variable reduction of F508del-CFTR function in presence or absence of ETI and upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines and ROS levels. Interestingly, HNECs treated with EXO isolated from the corresponding donor and three different pwCF showed a variable reduction of ETI-dependent F508del-CFTR function mainly due to clinical strains with limited effect of patient background. Furthermore, we demonstrated that ETI pretreatment decreased the cytokines and ROS levels down to the levels of uninfected cells. These preclinical studies suggest that <i>in vitro</i> screening of patient-specific response to CFTR modulators under infection/inflammation conditions could prove to be a valuable tool to enhance the prediction of clinical response."

While environmental sources of <i>P. aeruginosa</i> are well-documented in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, to our knowledge, this is the first reported case implicating toothbrush colonization as a likely source of recurrent <i>P. aeruginosa</i> infections in a patient with PCD. We present a case of a 53-year-old Puerto Rican male with a history of sinusitis, bronchiectasis, hearing loss, and chronic cough, diagnosed with PCD, having a positive genetic testing for <i>RSPH4A</i> (c.921+3_921+6del (intronic)) founder mutation. Despite aggressive treatment, the patient continued to experience recurrent <i>P. aeruginosa</i> infections. Investigation into potential environmental sources revealed that the patient's toothbrush was colonized with <i>P. aeruginosa</i>, making it a likely source of reinfection. After modifying his oral hygiene practices, the patient showed significant clinical improvement with no subsequent hospitalizations. This case highlights the novel identification of a toothbrush as a source of recurrent <i>P. aeruginosa</i> infections in a patient with PCD. It underscores the importance of considering environmental factors in the management of chronic respiratory infections in patients with PCD. These findings suggest that routine evaluation and disinfection of hygiene tools, such as toothbrushes, may be critical in preventing recurrent infections and their long-term consequences in patients with PCD. Future research should aim to establish clinical guidelines for preventing bacterial transmission from the built environment in this vulnerable population."

    "abstract": "<b>Background</b>: Sufficient choline supply is essential for tissue functions via phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin within membranes and secretions like bile, lipoproteins and surfactant, and in one-carbon metabolism via betaine. Choline requirements are linked to age and genetics, folate and cobalamin via betaine, and arachidonic (ARA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA) acid transport via the phosphatidylcholine moiety of lipoproteins. Groups at risk of choline deficiency include preterm infants, children with cystic fibrosis (CF) and patients dependent on parenteral nutrition. Fortifiers, formula and supplements may differently impact their choline supply. <b>Objective</b>: To evaluate added amounts of choline, folate, cobalamin, ARA and DHA in fortifiers, supplements and formula used in pediatric care from product files. <b>Methods</b>: Nutrient contents from commonly used products, categorized by age and patient groups, were obtained from public sources. Data are shown as medians and interquartile ranges. <b>Results</b>: 105 nutritional products including fortifiers, formula and products for special indications were analyzed. Choline concentrations were comparable in preterm and term infant formulas (≤6 months) (31.9 [27.6-33.3] vs. 33.3 [30.8-35.2] mg/100 kcal). Products for toddlers, and patients with CF, kidney or Crohn's disease showed Choline levels from 0 to 39 mg/100 kcal. Several products contain milk components and lecithin-based emulsifiers potentially increasing choline content beyond indicated amounts. <b>Conclusions</b>: Choline addition is standardized in formula for term and preterm infants up to 6 months, but not in other products. Choline content may be higher in several products due to non-declared sources. The potential impact of insufficient choline supply in patients at risk for choline deficiency suggests the need for biochemical analysis of products."

Medical records from 152 patients with genetically and laboratory-confirmed CF were reviewed through to 2025. The American Diabetes Association criteria were used to diagnose CFRD. Anthropometric and clinical data were collected from the latest medical records. A total of 17 out of 152 patients had CFRD, with a prevalence of 4.8% in the paediatric population (4/84) and 19.1% in adults (13/68). The median age of CFRD diagnosis was 14 years (range 9-22 years, SD = 3.95). Thirteen patients used insulin: one used bolus only, seven used basal-bolus multiple daily injections, and five used insulin pumps. The average total daily insulin (TDI) per kilogram (kg) body weight was 0.447 U/kg (SD = 0.429). The age at CFRD diagnosis was positively correlated with the body mass index (BMI) (<i>p</i> = 0.029). Patients requiring insulin by age 15 had higher TDI and were more likely to have CF liver disease (<i>p</i> = 0.027, <i>p</i> = 0.037, respectively). The prevalence of CFRD and age at diagnosis aligned with previous studies. Patients diagnosed at a younger age and requiring insulin earlier had lower BMIs, likely due to a faster decline in beta cell function and earlier onset of insulinopenia."

    "abstract": "Accurate genetic diagnosis is essential for appropriate treatment in cystic fibrosis (CF). Large copy number variants like duplications in the <i>CFTR</i> gene are rare and often classified as variants of uncertain significance (VUSs) due to unknown characteristics of the inserted material, complicating diagnosis and treatment decisions. We identified a previously uncharacterized exon 22 duplication (CFTRdup22) in the <i>CFTR</i> gene in two anamnestically unrelated people with CF, both exhibiting a mild phenotype. Initial classification as a VUS was based on standard genetic testing. We employed a custom next-generation sequencing (NGS) panel to determine the exact breakpoints of the duplication and conducted mRNA sequencing to confirm its effect on splicing. DNA and RNA analyses allowed for precise breakpoint determination, confirming that the duplication was in tandem and the reading frame remained intact. This, as well as a residual CFTRdup22 function of ~30% as measured via intestinal current measurement, is consistent with a clinically milder CF phenotype. Collectively, the precise characterization of the variants' breakpoints, localization and orientation enabled us to reclassify the variant as likely pathogenic. This study highlights the importance of advanced genetic techniques, such as NGS and breakpoint analysis, in accurately identifying CF-causing variants. It underscores the importance of a comprehensive approach and persistence when suspecting a specific genetic condition. This can aid in reclassifying VUSs, providing a definitive diagnosis for the affected family and enabling appropriate therapeutic interventions, including the use of CFTR modulators."

We also investigated the effects of these measures on pulmonary function tests (PFTs). <i>Materials and Methods</i>: This retrospective analysis involved adult cystic fibrosis (CF) patients who had thoracic computed tomography (CT) while in a stable clinical condition. A dedicated radiologist analyzed CT images and conducted modified Bhalla, Reiff, and PLND assessments. We analyzed the exacerbations and hospitalizations in the year after the CT scan. We also examined PFTs at the time of the CT scan and one year later. <i>Results</i>: This study's population consisted of 63 subjects (33 men), with a median age of 23.2 years. The median modified Bhalla score was 9.0 (IQR: 7.0-12.0), the median Reiff score was 11.0 (IQR: 8.0-15.0), and the median PLND was 79.4% (IQR: 74.5-82.0). The Bhalla score had the strongest relationship with both the number of exacerbations (<i>p</i> < 0.001, r: -0.559) and hospitalizations the following year (<i>p</i> < 0.001, r: -0.636), followed by the PLND score and the Reiff score. Youden's index shows that the optimum cut-off values for hospitalization at ≤2 and >2 are 6.5 for the modified Bhalla score, 13.5 for the Reiff score, and 76.5% for the PLND. <i>Conclusions</i>: The measurement of PLND may serve as a predictor for exacerbation and hospitalization rates, aligning with the modified Bhalla and Reiff scores, and shows potential for application in follow-up assessments."

    "abstract": "Chronic pancreatitis (CP) is a progressive inflammatory condition of the pancreas that leads to irreversible changes in pancreatic structure. The pancreatic α and β cells secrete hormones such as insulin and glucagon into the bloodstream. The pancreatic acinar cells secrete digestive enzymes that break down macromolecules. When these digestive enzymes do not function properly, maldigestion, malabsorption, and malnutrition may result. Presented here is a case study of an individual newly diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis, along with a genetic analysis of his son and an in-silico analysis of two of the variant proteins. This study was conducted using human subjects, namely, the proband (father) and his son. Medical genetic testing of the proband (father) identified the presence of two variants in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane receptor gene (<i>CFTR</i>): variant rs213950, resulting in a single amino acid change (p. Val470Met), and variant rs74767530, a nonsense variant (Arg1162Ter) with known pathogenicity for cystic fibrosis. Medical testing also revealed an additional missense variant, rs515726209 (Ala73Thr), in the <i>CTRC</i> gene. Cheek cell DNA was collected from both the proband and his son to determine the inheritance pattern and identify any additional variants. A variant in the human leukocyte antigen (rs7454108), which results in the HLA-DQ8 haplotype, was examined in both the proband and his son due to its known association with autoimmune disease, a condition also linked to chronic pancreatitis. In silico tools were subsequently used to examine the impact of the identified variants on protein function. Heterozygosity for all variants originally identified through medical genetic testing was confirmed in the proband and was absent in the son. Both the proband and his son were found to have the DRB1*0301 (common) haplotype for the HLA locus. However, the proband was also found to carry a linked noncoding variant, rs2647088, which was absent in the son. In silico analysis of variant rs213950 (Val470Met) in CFTR and rs515726209 (Ala73Thr) in CTRC revealed distinct changes in predicted ligand binding for both proteins, which may affect protein function and contribute to the development of CP. This case study of a proband and his son provides additional evidence for a polygenic inheritance pattern in CP. The results also highlight new information on the role of the variants on protein function, suggesting additional testing of ligand binding for these variants should be done to confirm the functional impairments."

    "abstract": "<i>Mycobacterium abscessus</i> (MABS) is an opportunistic pathogen that causes chronic, difficult-to-treat pulmonary infections, particularly in people with cystic fibrosis (PwCF), leading to rapid lung function decline and increased morbidity and mortality. Treatment is particularly challenging due to the pathogen's resistance mechanisms and the need for prolonged multidrug therapy, which is characterized by poor clinical outcomes and highlights the urgent need for novel therapeutic strategies. Imipenem/relebactam, a novel β-lactam-β-lactamase inhibitor combination, demonstrates in vitro activity against resistant MABS strains and effective pulmonary penetration. Prior research indicates synergistic activity of imipenem with various antibiotics against <i>M. abscessus</i>. This study aims to evaluate the in vitro activity of imipenem/relebactam, alone and in combination with various antibiotics, against MABS clinical isolates from PwCF (<i>n</i> = 28). Susceptibility and synergy were assessed using broth microdilution and checkerboard assays. Extracellular time-kill assays were performed to evaluate the bactericidal activity of synergistic three-drug combinations containing imipenem/relebactam. Imipenem/relebactam demonstrated potent in vitro activity against clinical MABS isolates, exhibiting substantial synergy with cefuroxime, cefdinir, amoxicillin, and cefoxitin. Rifabutin, azithromycin, moxifloxacin, clofazimine, and minocycline also demonstrated additive effects with imipenem/relebactam. Extracellular time-kill assays identified imipenem/relebactam + cefoxitin + rifabutin and imipenem/relebactam + cefoxitin + moxifloxacin as the most effective combinations. These findings suggest that imipenem/relebactam may offer a significant advancement in the management of MABS infections in PwCF. The promising efficacy of multidrug regimens combining imipenem/relebactam with agents like cefoxitin, azithromycin, moxifloxacin, clofazimine, and rifabutin highlights potential therapeutic strategies."

    "abstract": "Bronchiectasis is a chronic inflammatory airway disease characterized by a self-perpetuating vortex of impaired mucociliary clearance, persistent infection, and progressive structural lung damage. While inflammation is central to disease activity and progression, targeted anti-inflammatory treatments have been limited. Understanding the different types of inflammation involved and their significant overlap is essential for effective management. This review explores key inflammation patterns, biomarkers, and available treatments across the spectrum of inflammation in bronchiectasis, with a particular focus on non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis in adults. Neutrophilic inflammation remains the hallmark of bronchiectasis, with promising reversible dipeptidyl peptidase-1 inhibitors reducing the activation of neutrophil serine proteases during neutrophil maturation. Eosinophilic inflammation has also gained attention, with evidence indicating that patients with this endotype may benefit from glucocorticoids and biologic therapies targeting type 2 inflammation. Additional inflammatory mechanisms discussed here include impaired epithelial function and mucociliary abnormalities, immune dysregulation, and airway inflammation triggered by infections, environmental irritants, and autoimmune conditions. Written for general clinicians, this review simplifies complex concepts, underscores key aspects of diagnostic evaluation, and discusses both conventional and emerging treatments for bronchiectasis, providing practical insights for improved personalized patient care."

    "title": "Risk of Pancreatic Cancer in Cystic Fibrosis and Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator Germline Variants: A Retrospective Cohort Study.",
    "abstract": "Screening guidelines for pancreatic cancer (PC) based on genetic risk do not include patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) or cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene variants. The objective of this study was to determine risk of PC in patients with CF or CFTR pathogenic/likely pathogenic gene variants. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of CF/CFTR pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants patients in an integrated healthcare system from 2008 to 2023. Index date was the initial encounter within the health system, with censoring at loss of membership, death, or study completion. PC incidence rate was based on person-time at risk. Age-adjusted and sex-adjusted standardized incidence rate ratio (SIR) for PC was calculated for CF/CFTR compared with the non-CFTR reference population. We further stratified PC risk by age and family history of PC. A total of 12,682 patients with CF/CFTR were included with a median follow-up of 8.3 years (interquartile range 4.3-13.1). The cohort was 88% female, had median age at index of 25.8 (interquartile range 19.1-31.1) years, and was majority White and Hispanic. Eight total PC events occurred in the CF/CFTR group (incidence rate 7.3 per 100,000 person-years). The adjusted SIR for PC was 2.3 (95% confidence interval 1.2-4.7) for CF/CFTR variant patients. There was effect modification by age, with SIR (age ≥50 years) of 2.87 (95% confidence interval 1.37-6.01). Among CF/CFTR patients with family history of PC, 1 PC case was observed with SIR (age ≥50 years) of 13. Patients with CF or CFTR gene variants had an almost 3-fold higher adjusted risk of PC than the general population after the age of 50 years. The risk may be further increased with a family history of PC."

    "title": "Targeting the MEK1/2 pathway to combat <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> infection and inflammation in cystic fibrosis.",
    "abstract": "<i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> infections remain an ongoing challenge for people with cystic fibrosis (PwCF), with the increased global prevalence of multidrug-resistant strains requiring new therapeutic approaches. Our previous studies demonstrated anti-inflammatory effects of several MEK1/2 inhibitor compounds, including PD0325901, CI-1040, and trametinib, in human phagocytes from PwCF and a murine <i>S. aureus</i> pulmonary infection model (M. De, G. Serpa, E. Zuiker, K. B. Hisert, et al., Front Cell Infect Microbiol 14:1275940, 2024, https://doi.org/10.3389/fcimb.2024.1275940). A recently developed MEK1/2 inhibitor compound, ATR-002, has been recognized for its ability to exert direct antibacterial effects on gram-positive bacterial species, including <i>S. aureus</i> (C. Bruchhagen, M. Jarick, C. Mewis, T. Hertlein, et al., Sci Rep 8:9114, 2018, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-27445-7). However, whether ATR-002 elicits antibacterial effects on clinically relevant strains of <i>S. aureus</i> or anti-inflammatory effects is unknown. In this study, the effects of ATR-002 on human CF macrophage TLR2-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion were evaluated, demonstrating that ATR-002 reduced TNF-α and IL-8 secretion induced by the TLR2 agonists FSL-1 or Pam3CSK4. The antibacterial effects of ATR-002 were evaluated by minimum inhibitory concentration testing using <i>S. aureus</i> clinical isolates obtained from PwCF. Utilization of a murine methicillin-resistant <i>S. aureus</i> (MRSA) pulmonary infection model further confirmed the <i>in vivo</i> anti-inflammatory and antibacterial effects of ATR-002. Finally, infection of wild-type and <i>Mek2<sup>KO</sup></i> mice revealed that loss of MEK2 was host-protective during MRSA pulmonary infection by reducing neutrophil-mediated inflammation without altering bacterial clearance. In summary, this study highlights the therapeutic potential of targeting the MEK1/2 pathway to combat MRSA pulmonary infections.IMPORTANCE<i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> infections pose a significant burden on global healthcare systems. Community-associated transmission of methicillin-resistant <i>S. aureus</i> (MRSA) and the increasing prevalence of other drug-resistant <i>S. aureus</i> isolates limit therapeutic options to combat this opportunistic pathogen. Infection-induced inflammation is a significant driver of tissue damage, especially in cystic fibrosis pulmonary infections. However, therapeutic strategies that can reduce inflammation without compromising host defense and bacterial clearance mechanisms are lacking. This study investigates the dual anti-inflammatory and antibacterial effects of a MEK1/2 inhibitor as a therapeutic strategy to target both host and pathogen with a single compound. This work also identifies host MEK2 as a specific target that can be modulated to reduce inflammation without impairing host defense against MRSA pulmonary infection. Results from this study can inform future human clinical trials to evaluate the ability of the MEK1/2 inhibitor compound ATR-002 to both combat <i>S. aureus</i> infections and reduce inflammation that accompanies these infections."

    "title": "Advancing Therapeutic Strategies for Nonsense-Related Diseases: From Small Molecules to Nucleic Acid-Based Innovations.",
    "abstract": "Nonsense mutations in gene coding regions introduce an in-frame premature termination codon (PTC) in the mRNA transcript, resulting in the early termination of translation and the production of a truncated, nonfunctional protein. The absence of protein expression and the consequent loss of essential cellular functions are responsible for the severe phenotypes in the so-called genetic nonsense-related diseases (NRDs), such as cystic fibrosis, hemophilia, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Fabry disease, Choroideremia, Usher syndrome, Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, and even certain types of cancer. Nonsense mutations pose a significant challenge in the treatment of NRDs, as a specific approach directly addressing this genetic defect is currently unavailable. Developing new therapeutic strategies for nonsense suppression is a crucial goal of precision medicine. This review describes some of the most promising therapeutic approaches and emerging strategies for treating NRDs. It considered both the use of small molecules to interfere with molecular mechanisms related to nonsense mutations, such as translational readthrough-inducing drugs (TRIDs) or inhibitors of the nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) pathway, and also innovative approaches involving nucleic acids, such as gene editing, anticodon engineered-tRNA (ACE-tRNA), or mRNA-based therapy. Future research should focus on refining these approaches and exploring integrated and personalized treatments to enhance therapeutic outcomes and ensure continuous improvement in the quality of care."

    "title": "Ivacaftor-tezacaftor-elexacaftor, tezacaftor-ivacaftor and lumacaftor-ivacaftor for treating cystic fibrosis: a systematic review and economic evaluation.",
    "abstract": "Cystic fibrosis is a life-limiting genetic condition that affects over 9000 people in England. Cystic fibrosis is usually diagnosed through newborn screening and causes symptoms throughout the body, including the lungs and digestive system. Around 90% of individuals with cystic fibrosis have at least one copy of the <i>F508del</i> mutation on the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene. To appraise the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor, tezacaftor-ivacaftor and lumacaftor-ivacaftor within their expected marketing authorisations for treating people with cystic fibrosis and at least one <i>F508del</i> mutation, compared with each other and with established clinical management before these treatments. A de novo systematic literature review (search date February 2023) was conducted searching electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials), bibliographies of relevant systematic literature reviews, clinical trial registers, recent conferences and evidence provided by Vertex Pharmaceuticals (Boston, MA, USA). Data on the following outcomes were summarised: acute change in per cent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (change in weight-for-age <i>z</i>-score; and change in pulmonary exacerbation frequency requiring intravenous antibiotics. Network meta-analyses were conducted where head-to-head data were not available. Data from clinical trials and real-world evidence were examined to assess long-term effectiveness. A patient-level simulation model was developed to assess the cost-effectiveness of the three modulator treatments. The model employed a lifetime horizon and was developed from the perspective of the National Health Service. Data from 19 primary studies and 7 open-label extension studies were prioritised in the systematic literature review. Elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor was associated with a statistically significant increase in predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second and weight-for-age <i>z</i>-score and a reduction in pulmonary exacerbations compared with established clinical management, lumacaftor/ivacaftor and tezacaftor/ivacaftor, and also led to a reduction in the rate of predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second decline relative to established clinical management, although the magnitude of this decrease was uncertain. Lumacaftor/ivacaftor and tezacaftor/ivacaftor were also associated with a statistically significant increase in predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second and reduction in pulmonary exacerbations relative to established clinical management, but with a smaller effect size than elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor. There was some evidence that tezacaftor/ivacaftor reduced the rate of predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second decline relative to established clinical management, but little evidence that lumacaftor/ivacaftor reduced the rate of predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second decline relative to established clinical management. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios from the economic analysis were confidential. However, for all genotypes studied the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were above what would be considered cost-effective based on the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence threshold of £20,000-30,000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained. Despite the improved clinical benefits observed, none of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene modulators assessed would be considered cost-effective based on the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence threshold of £20,000-30,000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained. This is largely driven by the high acquisition costs of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene modulator treatments. This study is registered as PROSPERO CRD42023399583.

    "title": "<i>Mycobacterium abscessus</i> persistence in the face of <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> antagonism.",
    "abstract": "Chronic bacterial infections are responsible for significant morbidity and mortality in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> (<i>Pa</i>), the dominant CF pathogen, and <i>Mycobacterium abscessus</i> (<i>Mab</i>) can individually cause persistent, difficult to treat pulmonary infections. Co-infection by both pathogens leads to severe disease and poor clinical outcomes. Although interactions between <i>Pa</i> and other co-infecting pathogens in CF patients have been the focus of numerous studies, the dynamics of <i>Pa-Mab</i> interactions remain poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap, the study examined how <i>Mab</i> and <i>Pa</i> influenced each other through culture-based growth assays and molecular-based dual RNAseq analysis. Growth was measured by CFU determination and luminescence reporter -based readouts. In initial studies, we noted that the growth of <i>Pa</i> continued unimpeded in a planktonic co-culture model, whereas <i>Pa</i> appeared to exert a bacteriostatic effect on <i>Mab</i>. Strikingly, exposure of <i>Mab</i> to cell-free spent supernatant of <i>Pa</i> resulted in a dramatic, dose-dependent bactericidal effect. Initial characterization indicated that this potent <i>Pa</i>-derived anti-<i>Mab</i> cidal activity was mediated by a heat-sensitive, protease-insensitive soluble factor of >3kDa size. Further analysis demonstrated that expression of this mycobactericidal factor requires LasR, a central regulator of <i>Pa</i> quorum sensing (QS). In contrast, ΔLasR <i>Pa</i> was still able to exert a bacteriostatic effect on Mab during co-culture, pointing to additional LasR-independent factors able to antagonize <i>Mab</i> growth. However, the ability of <i>Mab</i> to adapt during co-culture to counter the cidal effects of a LasR regulated factor suggested complex interspecies dynamics. Dual RNAseq analysis of <i>Mab</i>-<i>Pa</i> co-cultures revealed significant transcriptional remodeling of <i>Mab</i>, with differential expression of 68% of <i>Mab</i> genes compared to minimal transcriptional changes in <i>Pa</i>. Transcriptome analysis reflected slowed <i>Mab</i> growth and metabolic changes akin to a non-replicating persister phase. A tailored <i>Mab</i> response to <i>Pa</i> was evident by enhanced transcript levels of genes predicted to counteract alkylquinolone QS signals, respiratory toxins, and hydrogen cyanide. The study showed <i>Mab</i> is capable of coexisting with <i>Pa</i> despite <i>Pa</i>'s antagonistic effects, eliciting an adaptive molecular response in <i>Mab</i>. This study provides the first transcriptome-level insight into genetic interactions between the two CF pathogens offering potential strategies for disrupting their communities in a CF lung to improve patient clinical performance. Moreover, identification of a novel antimicrobial natural product with potent cidal activity against <i>Mab</i> could lead to new drug targets and therapies for Mab infections."

    "title": "Simple Nephrectomy for Non-Functioning Kidney: An Institutional Experience with Non-Neoplastic and Incidentally Detected Neoplastic Lesions.",
    "abstract": "<i>Introduction.</i> Chronic kidney diseases are attributed to a variety of etiologies, including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, vascular diseases, cystic kidney diseases, chronic tubulo-interstitial diseases, chronic pyelonephritis, and glomerular diseases. Simple nephrectomy is indicated when the loss of renal function in a unilateral non-functional kidney is permanent in a persistently symptomatic patient. Uncommonly, a non-functional kidney may develop neoplasm unsuspected pre-operatively and be diagnosed only during histopathological examination of nephrectomy specimen. <i>Material and methods.</i> We examined 275 simple nephrectomies performed between 2019 and 2024 in patients with non-functional kidneys confirmed by DMSA scan. All nephrectomies done for diagnosed or even suspected tumors by pre-operative imaging were excluded from the study. <i>Results.</i> Chronic pyelonephritis (79.3%) was the most common histopathological diagnosis, followed by xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis (8.7%) and granulomatous pyelonephritis (5.4%). In five (1.8%) patients, microscopy revealed non-specific chronic interstitial inflammation and interstitial fibrosis. One patient (0.4%) was diagnosed with large solitary pyelogenic cyst and renal nocardiosis. Eleven patients (4%) were diagnosed with neoplasms. Clear cell renal cell carcinoma was the most common diagnosis (27.2%), followed by urothelial carcinomas of renal pelvis (18.2%), one patient each of collecting duct carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma of renal pelvis, and multilocular cystic renal neoplasm of low malignant potential. Three patients had papillary adenomas. <i>Conclusion.</i> Diligent histopathological examination of simple nephrectomy is crucial in establishing the final diagnosis with important further therapeutic implications. This is especially important in neoplastic pathologies developing in non-functional kidneys that may rarely be unsuspected by pre-operative imaging and diagnosed only during histopathological evaluation."

    "abstract": "To predict severe primary graft dysfunction (PGD3) after double-lung transplantation in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients using intraoperative data. A retrospective single-center cohort study. University Hospital, France. CF patients who underwent double-lung transplantation between 2012 and 2019. Patients younger than age 18 and those with multiorgan transplants, retransplantation, or intraoperative cardiopulmonary bypass were excluded. None. Sixty-nine variables were recorded in real-time across the nine time-points. PGD3 occurred in 24 patients (15.5%). PGD3 WAS ASSESSED ON POSTOPERATIVE DAY 3: A logistic regression model to predict PGD3 was developed using data collected at nine predefined time-points during surgery, from start (recipient and donor variables) to finish. The model's area under the curve improved progressively during surgery, rising from 0.764 to 0.892. The optimal model incorporated five variables: three associated with reduced PGD3 risk (preoperative pulmonary hypertension, donor body mass index, and PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio at surgery's end) and two were linked to increased risk (lactate level at second pulmonary artery clamping and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [ECMO] use at surgery's end). The risk of PGD3 increased by a factor of 11.48 (95% CI 4.48-29.39; p < 0.001) when ECMO was required at the end of surgery and by 1.29 (95% CI: 1.02-1.63; p = 0.035) for each 1 mEq/L rise in lactate concentration at time-point 7 (second pulmonary artery clamping). This predictive model underscores the adverse impact of sustained ECMO placed at the end of surgery and elevated intraoperative lactate levels on PGD3 risk."

    "abstract": "Elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI) has led to substantial improvements in the clinical outcome of people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF). However, its effects on exercise capacity remain uncertain. This retrospective cohort study included 71 pwCF who started ETI between March 2020 and September 2022. The best performance on the 6-min walk test (6MWT), defined as the peak walking distance achieved, was compared between the 12 months preceding ETI initiation and the first 14 months of treatment. Pulmonary function tests (PFT) and Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R) were analyzed at treatment initiation and after 12 months. After starting ETI, the 6MWT was performed at a median interval of 356 [296-380] days. The mean 6-min walk distance (6MWD) was 641 m ± 85.5 at baseline. After treatment, the 6MWD showed a significant absolute increase of 15.8 m (P = 0.007). Improvement was greater in pwCF with a percent predicted FEV1 (ppFEV1) ≤40, showing a mean increase of 37.8 m (P = 0.009), and in those without prior CFTR modulator therapy with an increase of 21.6 m (P = 0.016). After 12 months, the absolute increase in ppFEV1 was 15.8 (P < 0.001). The absolute changes from baseline in CFQ-R physical and respiratory scores were 17.9 (P < 0.001) and 27 points (P < 0.001), respectively. No correlation was found between changes in 6MWT and changes in PFT results. ETI improved exercise capacity in pwCF, as evidenced by a significant increase in the 6MWD. ETI was also associated with improvements in physical-related quality of life. Changes in PFT results cannot predict changes in 6MWT results after ETI therapy."

The objective of this study was to assess the prevalence of intermediate sweat chloride levels, 30-59 mmol/L, in healthy young adults and the relationship between sweat chloride and pulmonary function. Healthy volunteers >18 years of age were enrolled in this single center, prospective, cross-sectional pilot study. Sweat chloride testing was performed by pilocarpine iontophoresis. Study participants completed the ATS-DLD LHS-III modified general respiratory symptom questionnaire, spirometry pre- and post-inhaled bronchodilator, and Lung Clearance Index. 93 subjects were enrolled. 1 subject withdrew and 2 had insufficient sweat volumes collected. Median (IQR) age was 27 years (25, 33) and 40 % were male. Median (IQR) sweat chloride was 21 mmol/L (12, 29). 25/90 subjects (28 %) had intermediate sweat chloride values, median 37 (33, 40) mmol/L. 60 % of individuals with intermediate sweat chloride values were male as compared to 34 % of individuals with normal sweat chloride values, p < 0.001. Median FEV<sub>1</sub> (% predicted) was 100 (90, 109), FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC 0.83 (0.81, 0.86), and LCI was 6.01 (5.38, 6.98). There were no differences in pulmonary function between those with normal and intermediate sweat chloride values. A significant number of healthy young adults have intermediate sweat chloride levels, but no differences in spirometry and LCI were found. Larger studies, including genetic analyses, are needed to determine if mild CFTR dysfunction impacts respiratory health, especially in older individuals with respiratory co-morbidities."

In Denmark, prenatal testing is offered when there is a family history of CF or ultrasound anomalies suggest an increased risk of the disease. This study evaluates indications for prenatal CF testing and their outcomes. Clinical indications and genetic results were analyzed for pregnancies undergoing CF testing in the Central Denmark Region between August 2012 to 2023. The data were categorized according to clinical indication. Among 302 prenatal CF tests, echogenic bowel was the most frequent (44.7%, N = 135), leading to identification of one CF-affected fetus (0.7%). The second most common indication was EB together with non-CF-associated ultrasound findings (29.5%, N = 89), with no CF-affected fetuses. Known CF predisposition due to family history (15.6%, N = 47) identified five affected fetuses (10.6%) and 25 carriers (53.2%). No CF cases were detected in other included groups (N = 31). This data shows that echogenic bowel has a low positive predictive value for cystic fibrosis in the fetus (1:230) in a country with combined first trimester screening but no systematic pre-conception or prenatal screening program for cystic fibrosis. Although the relative risk is increased compared to the general population (1:2,500), echogenic bowel appears to be a marker of limited clinical utility. In settings without dedicated CF screening strategies, this underscores the importance of considering the most effective allocation of diagnostic resources."

Digital innovations have the potential to address gaps in SRH care as scalable, low-cost, patient-centered solutions that supplement the formal healthcare system. Our multidisciplinary team has developed a suite of patient-facing digital tools to help address suboptimal SRH care delivery for marginalized individuals capable of pregnancy, including those with chronic medical conditions. These tools-MyPath for reproductive preferences, prepregnancy health, and contraception; MyVoice for SRH needs of people with rheumatic/autoimmune disease or cystic fibrosis; MyDecision for tubal sterilization; and MyHealthyPregnancy for tailored pregnancy support-are guided by principles of community engagement, person-centeredness, and health equity. In the wake of the Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization 2022 Supreme Court decision overturning federal abortion protections, as well as the rapidly shifting policy landscape under the current administration, there are new considerations for use and implementation of digital SRH tools. In this commentary, we draw directly from lessons learned in our work to discuss emerging concerns related to data privacy and pregnancy criminalization, trust in healthcare providers and systems, and research. We then propose recommendations for researchers seeking to create, implement, and evaluate these tools with the goal of safeguarding reproductive autonomy and achieving health equity in this new policy context."

CF transmembrane conductance regulator modulators (CFTRm) improve lung function in people with CF. The US Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (SRTR) data were used to assess rates of lung transplant waitlisting, waitlist removal, pre-transplant mortality, and lung transplantation in people with CF (CF cohort) compared to those with other respiratory conditions (non-CF cohort) across three time periods: (i) prior to approval of any CFTRm (Pre-CFTRm era); (ii) from approval of ivacaftor to pre-approval of elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (Pre-ETI CFTRm era); and (iii) after approval of ETI (ETI era). Among the CF cohort, new waitlistings decreased by 78 % in ETI era compared to Pre-ETI CFTRm era while rates increased in the non-CF cohort. Among the CF cohort, waitlist removal for improving condition increased 18-fold in ETI era compared to Pre-ETI CFTRm era; rates remained stable among the non-CF cohort. Lung transplants decreased by 72 % in ETI era compared to pre-ETI CFTRm era; rates increased among the non-CF cohort. These results suggest the availability of ETI is associated with reductions in demand for lung transplants for people with CF, increasing availability of donor lungs for non-CF candidates."

However, it may suggest that each type of CRS is caused by a single underlying mechanism, potentially leading clinicians to overlook that, in reality, multiple factors can drive CRS development. The incidence of CRS stemming from multiple etiologies remains currently underexplored. We report an illustrative case of a CF patient with concomitant NSAID-Exacerbated Respiratory Disease (NERD), necessitating two distinct targeted therapies to achieve effective symptomatic relief."

    "title": "Unlocking Asthma Remission: Key Insights From an Expert Roundtable Discussion.",
    "abstract": "Treatment targets in severe asthma have evolved towards a remission-focused paradigm guided by precision medicine. This novel concept requires a shift from evaluating the efficacy of therapies based on a single outcome at a single time point to an outcome that captures the complexity of asthma remission involving several domains assessed over a sustained period. Since the concept is still emerging, multiple definitions have been proposed, ranging from symptom control and exacerbation-free to resolution of underlying pathobiology, with varying rigour in each parameter. Understanding the strengths and weaknesses of the current construct is needed to progress further. We conducted a roundtable discussion with 27 asthma experts to address this issue, and discussions were narratively synthesised and summarised. The participants observed that between one in three and one in five people treated with targeted biological therapies or macrolides experience low disease activity over a sustained period. They unanimously agreed that labelling the attained clinical state as clinical remission is useful as a clinical (e.g., facilitating a treat-to-target approach), policy (e.g., widening eligibility criteria for biologics), and scientific (e.g., a path to understanding cure) tool. Current remission rates vary significantly due to definition variability. When assessing remission, it is essential to consider confounding factors (e.g., steroid use for adrenal insufficiency). More research is required to reach an acceptable definition, and including the patient's voice in such research is essential. In conclusion, the concept of treatment-induced clinical remission is possible and valuable in asthma. However, further refinement of the definition is required."

    "title": "Airway epithelial cell-specific deletion of EGFR modulates mucoinflammatory features of cystic fibrosis-like lung disease in mice.",
    "abstract": "Mucoinflammatory lung disease in cystic fibrosis (CF) is characterized by airway surface liquid (ASL) layer dehydration and mucins hyperconcentration, which leads to airway obstruction, inflammation, bronchiectasis, and increased susceptibility to recurrent bacterial infections. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is known to regulate airway mucous cell metaplasia (MCM) and mucins expression, but the role of EGFR pathway in the pathogenesis of CF-like lung disease remains unclear. Therefore, we hypothesized that airway epithelial cell-specific deficiency of EGFR mitigates mucoinflammatory responses in <i>Scnn1b</i>-transgenic (Tg+) mice that phenocopy human CF-like lung disease. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effect of airway epithelial cell-specific EGFR deficiency on the manifestation of mucoinflammatory outcomes in Tg+ mice. The airway epithelial cell-specific EGFR-deficient wild-type (WT) mice did not exhibit any obvious structural and functional defects in the lungs. The deletion of EGFR in airway epithelial cells in Tg+ mice, however, resulted in increased recruitment of neutrophils and macrophages into the lung airspaces, which was accompanied by significantly increased bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) levels of inflammatory mediators, including KC, G-CSF, MIP-2, MIP-1α, TNF-α, and MIP-1β. Additionally, as compared with the EGFR-sufficient Tg+ mice, the airway epithelial cell-specific EGFR-deficient Tg+ mice exhibited significantly increased postnatal mortality and compromised bacterial clearance. The deletion of EGFR in the airway epithelial cells of Tg+ mice resulted in an increased degree of mucus obstruction, which was associated with an increase in MCM and MUC5B production. Some of the molecular markers of type 2 inflammation, including <i>Il13</i>, <i>Slc26a4</i>, and <i>Retnla</i>, were significantly increased in airway epithelial cell-specific EGFR-deficient Tg+ mice versus EGFR-sufficient Tg+ mice. Taken together, our data show that EGFR deletion in the airway epithelial cells compromises postnatal survival, delays bacterial clearance, and modulates inflammatory and mucus obstruction-relevant endpoints, i.e., MCM, MUC5B production, and mucus obstruction, in Tg+ mice."

    "title": "Population Pharmacokinetics of Elexacaftor, Tezacaftor and Ivacaftor in a Real-World Cohort of Adults with Cystic Fibrosis.",
    "abstract": "Elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor (ETI), a combination of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators, has become the therapeutic standard of care for most people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF). People with cystic fibrosis exhibit differences in CFTR genotypes and have important differences in phenotypic characteristics including age, body weight, pancreatic status, disease severity, and comorbidities. While these differences predict large interindividual variability (IIV) in ETI exposure, there is a unique dose regimen recommended for adults. This raises questions around the \"one-dose fits all\" strategy. The aims of this study were to describe real-world population pharmacokinetics (Pop-PK) of ETI in adults with CF and identify factors associated with IIV. As part of the ongoing French national observational cohort study the Pop-PK analysis included 552 plasma concentrations drawn routinely from 325 adults with CF. A one-compartment model with first order absorption and elimination best represented all three compounds, and an additional lag-time for elexacaftor PK data. Large IIV was observed in ETI, with an area under the curve (AUC<sub>0-24h</sub> for elexacaftor and tezacaftor, and AUC<sub>0-12h</sub> for ivacaftor) ranging respectively, from 58.7-422.9 mg⋅h/L; 38.0-207.7 mg⋅h/L and 4.9-64.9 mg⋅h/L. The main sources of IIV identified in the final ETI Pop-PK models were body weight, age, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and CFTR genotype. This study established the first ETI Pop-PK analysis in adults with CF and identified several covariates that explain IIV. Therapeutic drug monitoring may be beneficial for patients with a small body weight, older ages, carrying one ETI-responsive CFTR variant or those with no exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and especially for patients who combine these characteristics. Therapeutic drug monitoring may also prove to be useful in individuals experiencing adverse events, in those with reduced effectiveness, or to help manage non-adherence issues."

    "abstract": "Surveys are widely used in healthcare to gather knowledge and information about services provided. There is a recognised gap between survey findings and their impact on practice, particularly for standardised surveys conducted at the national or organisational level. Findings are more likely to be acted on where there is a culture and infrastructure supportive of quality improvement (QI), but little is known about the experiences of local QI teams designing and using surveys in practice. To understand the experiences of QI teams designing and using surveys within a national QI collaborative, including perceived value and challenges. Using an interactive research approach, 14 semistructured interviews were conducted with members of the Cystic Fibrosis Lung Transplant Transition Learning and Leadership Collaborative. Data were analysed through multiple rounds of coding and inductive thematic analysis. Collaborative participants viewed surveys positively as an improvement tool. The design and use of surveys was a team-based effort, embedded within the structure of the collaborative. Surveys illuminated local, microsystem and mesosystem data and provided patient and staff insights. As one step in the QI journey, surveys helped shape the direction of local QI work, resulting in positive changes in areas such as working relationships, patient interactions, staff education and work processes.Challenges experienced included: response rates and survey design, inability to act on findings, issues of sensitivity and anonymity, expertise to design surveys, time requirements, and survey fatigue. Surveys played a crucial role in driving QI efforts, leading to impactful changes in practice. Used within a supportive collaborative context, surveys became an essential tool for ongoing learning and improvement, highlighting the distinct needs of surveys used in QI compared with research."

    "abstract": "The care paths and lives of cystic fibrosis patients were profoundly altered during the health crisis in France. Patient experiences can be used to provide lessons on how to adapt to a crisis. The ExPaParM collaborative study analyzed the experiences of a varied sample of patients and identified changes in practices in Cystic Fibrosis Centers (CFC), with the aim of characterizing adaptations made and destabilizing events experienced during this crisis, using a systemic approach. Adaptation practices aiming to minimize the impact of the crisis or maintain the recommended quality of care, as far as possible, have been identified. These adaptations concern the individual level (patient and family), local care, care management at CFCs, and hospital organization. When the crisis has negatively affected patients, resilience factors based on individual and family skills, a relationship of trust with professionals, and informal solidarity networks have enabled complex situations to be overcome. Strong points prior to the crisis proved decisive: the structuring of CFC teams, digital resources, therapeutic patient education, and a circuit for disseminating information related to cystic fibrosis. Reducing vulnerability to a future crisis also means securing essential medicines for the disease, organizing protected hospital circuits, and developing patient preparedness plans."

    "abstract": "Stenotrophomonas maltophilia has emerged as an opportunistic pathogen originating from the environments, causing nosocomial infections, particularly in immunocompromised individuals and patients with cystic fibrosis. Although this microorganism exhibits low virulence, its infections are associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. S. maltophilia is intrinsically resistant to many antimicrobial agents used in clinical practices, therefore, posing significant treatment challenges. The multidrug resistance in S. maltophilia results from a combination of intrinsic, adaptive, and acquired mechanisms. S. maltophilia genome carries an array of genes encoding multidrug efflux pumps, which are key contributors to its broad-spectrum antibiotic resistance by expelling a wide range of drugs and reducing their intracellular concentrations to nontoxic levels. The majority of these efflux pumps belong to the resistance-nodulation-cell division (RND) family, while a lesser fraction is classified under the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) and the adenosine triphosphate binding cassette (ABC) family. In terms of function, substrate specificity, and complex gene regulation, these multidrug efflux pumps contribute not only to the survival of S. maltophilia under antibiotic stress but also to its resilience against other chemical challenges, including oxidative stress-generating substances and biocides. The roles of certain efflux pump systems in acquired and adaptive antibiotic resistance, as well as their potential applications as drug targets to enhance the efficacy of routinely used antibiotics through the use of small molecules capable of functioning as efflux pump inhibitors, are also discussed. A deeper understanding of these mechanisms can contribute to the more effective management against antibiotic-resistant S. maltophilia."

    "abstract": "Soluble ST2 (sST2), a decoy receptor for the alarmin interleukin-33 (IL-33), has been implicated in adverse clinical outcomes in acute respiratory failure (ARF). We evaluated sST2 distribution across diverse cohorts of patients with different etiologies of ARF, compared plasma and lower respiratory tract (LRT) concentrations, and examined associations with individual organ dysfunction, biological subphenotypes, and outcomes. Observational study. Multicenter cohorts of ARF patients. A total of 1432 ARF patients, including 863 non-COVID and 569 COVID-19 cases, from five cohorts. None. sST2 levels were measured in plasma and LRT specimens (when available) and analyzed for associations with ARF etiology, severity, organ dysfunction, systemic host response, subphenotypes, and 30-day mortality. Plasma sST2 levels were higher in non-COVID ARF patients compared with COVID-19 patients (p < 0.05) and were markedly elevated compared with LRT levels (> 19-fold), with weak intercompartmental correlation. Elevated plasma sST2 levels were associated with extrapulmonary organ dysfunction and a hyperinflammatory ARF subphenotype but not with respiratory indices, including hypoxemia. Plasma sST2 independently predicted 30-day mortality in pooled cohort data, adjusted for age, sex, and illness severity. In longitudinal measurements, nonsurvivors had persistently elevated plasma sST2 levels in the first 2 weeks of critical illness compared with survivors. Plasma sST2 levels independently predict outcomes in ARF and are strongly associated with extrapulmonary organ dysfunction. The weak correlation between plasma and LRT sST2 levels suggests a predominantly systemic source. These findings highlight the potential of the IL-33/ST2 axis as a therapeutic target and warrant further investigation into its role in multiple organ dysfunction in ARF."

    "title": "Molecular docking and simulation studies of outer membrane proteins with piperacillin; a broad-spectrum antibiotic against <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>.",
    "abstract": "One of the most important public health concerns is the rise of the multi-drug resistance bacteria in the recent years. <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> is a frequent Gram-negative bacterium prominent in the hospital-acquired illness and is considered as an opportunistic human pathogen responsible for causing nosocomial infections. Numerous burn victims, cystic fibrosis patients, and those with neutropenic malignancy die as a result of it. The current approach involves molecular docking for the predominant recognition of the drug binding site for the designing of the potent inhibitors for inhibiting the membrane protein of <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>. The present study has targeted 11 outer membrane proteins of <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> with 12 different FDA approved drugs. Protein modeling has been applied to create the target proteins. As per the results revealed out from the docking perspective, Piperacillin which has been categorized under the broad-spectrum antibiotics has emerged out as one of the forerunners as compared to the other group of antibiotics as it exhibited highest binding energy, i.e. -10.4 kcal/mol. Hence, the compound has been validated using <i>in-silico</i> tools such as ADME and PROTOX-II server which indicates its nontoxic nature. Molecular dynamics simulations were conducted for EGCG-OprP, Piperacillin-OprB, OprP (Apoprotein), and OprB (Apoprotein) complexes to assess their binding efficacy. Statistical parameters such as RMSD, RMSF, h-bond interactions, and % occupancies indicated stability in ligand binding. Protein RMSD values plateaued at approximately 0.5 nm, while ligand RMSD values remained below 0.2 nm, affirming stability in binding OprP and OprB. H-bond analysis revealed stable contacts for EGCG and Piperacillin, and % occupancies indicated specific interactions. Energetics analysis yielded deltaG values of -30.45 for EGCG and -56.66 for Piperacillin, suggesting efficient binding with OprP and OprB. This positioned Piperacillin as a promising candidate for future pharmacological studies, considering its classification as a broad-spectrum antibiotic against P. aeruginosa. The study served as a crucial roadmap for designing drugs to inhibit this formidable pathogen amid rising antibiotic resistance, emphasizing its significance in the ongoing battle against infectious diseases."

    "abstract": "Ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP) of donor lungs not otherwise acceptable for transplantation can provide outcomes similar to standard-criteria lung transplantation and has been reported to increase transplant volume by approximately 20% in some transplant centers. Evidence to support decisions about use of EVLP is limited, so expert opinion can be a useful decision aid. This study developed expert consensus recommendations for EVLP with acellular perfusate using a modified Delphi method. A panel of 18 physicians with expertise in lung transplantation and EVLP who practice in North America completed three surveys on EVLP: Survey 1 used open-ended questions; Survey 2 used primarily Likert-scale questions; and Survey 3 repeated Survey 2 while providing panelists with the Survey 2 results. A follow-up meeting after Survey 3 probed open questions. The primary goal for EVLP is expanding the number of donor lungs available for transplant. Lungs that are acceptable after EVLP are equivalent to lungs that met standard criteria initially. Lungs with unclear or marginal quality should be placed on EVLP for evaluation, including lungs received from third party organizations with incomplete or concerning information. Decisions on whether to put lungs on EVLP require nuanced clinical judgement and should consider compliance and deflation, the ratio of PaO2 to fraction of inspired oxygen (P/F ratio), peak inspiratory pressure (PIP), edema on imaging, and bronchoscopy, with additional parameters considered as appropriate if lung quality is unclear. EVLP lungs are appropriate for transplant if all relevant parameters are acceptable and may be appropriate if some parameters are borderline depending on clinical judgment. Decisions about transplanting EVLP lungs should consider radiography, delta PO2, overall movement, STEEN Solution™ loss, bronchoscopy, peak airway pressure, and palpation, along with other parameters as appropriate. Key open areas for research include evidence-based criteria for lung selection and assessment, the role of biomarkers, and enhanced techniques and perfusion solutions. In addition, the role of EVLP is unclear in lungs with pulmonary emboli and lungs procured with normothermic regional perfusion (NRP), as is the maximal duration of cold ischemia time (CIT). Decisions about EVLP require nuanced consideration of numerous parameters. Expert opinion from this study may help optimize use of EVLP."

    "abstract": "This narrative review aims to describe the evolution, classification, nutritional composition, and clinical applications of enteral infant formulas, with an emphasis on pediatric patients who are unable to be breastfed or follow conventional feeding methods. The primary objective is to analyze the different types of formulas available - polymeric, hydrolyzed, elemental, and blenderized - and their indications based on clinical scenarios and specific patient needs. The methodology used was a non-systematic narrative review. Relevant scientific literature was selected through a targeted search of databases such as PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar, including publications from the last 20 years in both English and Spanish. Key search terms included \"enteral nutrition,\" \"infant formula,\" \"nutritional therapy,\" and \"pediatric enteral feeding.\" The article traces the historical development of infant nutrition, from breastfeeding and wet nursing to modern enteral formulas. It explains the macronutrient composition of each formula type, their preparation methods, palatability, osmolality, and caloric density. Clinical considerations and recommended formulas for specific diseases - such as obesity, cow's milk allergy, Crohn's disease, eosinophilic esophagitis, necrotizing enterocolitis, short bowel syndrome, and cystic fibrosis - are discussed in detail. Additionally, the review outlines the regulatory context in the United States and Europe, noting that these products are classified as medical foods and not pharmaceuticals, and are thus subject to distinct safety, composition, and labeling requirements. The review concludes that although breastfeeding remains the gold standard in infant nutrition, enteral formulas are indispensable in many clinical situations. Future research is expected to focus on the development of more targeted, functional, and personalized formulas to address the needs of vulnerable pediatric populations."

The study aimed to determine the efficacy of dornase alpha nebulization on persistent atelectasis in non-cystic fibrosis patients with and without artificial airways. Methodology A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted on patients admitted to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) of King Fahad Medical City (KFMC) between February 2020 and October 2023. The pre- and post-treatment MRAS (Modified Radiologically Assisted Score) was used to determine the treatment efficacy. The independent t-test and chi-square test were used for statistical analysis. Multivariate regression analysis was applied after estimating the propensity score to adjust baseline characteristics to reduce selection and indication bias. A value of p<0.05 was taken to indicate statistical significance. Results Dornase alpha was not an independent positive predictor of MRAS score improvement (B=0.326, p=0.757, Exp(B)=1.385) beyond other variables. However, the dornase group (n = 132) significantly improved the mean MRAS score by 6.08+2.69 compared to the non-dornase group's (n=143) mean MRAS score of 5.14+2.4, with a moderate effect size (Cohen's d=0.364, 95% CI: 0.126 to 0.603; p=0.03) in resolving persistent atelectasis. Conclusion Dornase alpha did not independently improve MRAS scores in pediatric patients with persistent atelectasis, controlling for selection/indication bias and confounding variables. The observed differences in MRAS improvement in the initial analysis were most likely due to baseline differences."

    "abstract": "Following the development of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators (ivacaftor, tezacaftor, elexacaftor, and lumacaftor), the prognosis for people diagnosed with cystic fibrosis (pwCF) has improved. Understanding the pharmacokinetics (PK) of CFTR modulators is crucial to provide optimal care, particularly in special cystic fibrosis (CF) populations such as pwCF with hepatic impairment, pancreatic insufficiency, those who are pregnant or lactating, or who are children. We aim to provide an overview of the PK of CFTR modulators in these populations. A systematic literature search was carried out in PubMed and Embase on 20 June 2024. Studies were considered relevant when information on PK or exposure of CFTR-modulating drugs was available. PwCF with mild/moderate hepatic impairment do not exhibit substantially higher exposure to CFTR modulators compared with those without liver involvement or healthy individuals. Similarly, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency has no effect on the PK of CFTR modulators in adult pwCF. In contrast, pediatric pwCF are exposed to higher levels of CFTR modulators relative to adults, as children receive higher weight-based doses (mg/kg) to ensure equivalent therapeutic efficacy. The PK of CFTR modulators have been more extensively studied in adults, pwCF with mild/moderate hepatic impairment, and children. However, ensuring adequate dosing remains challenging. Knowledge gaps persist for adults with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C), children with CF-induced hepatic impairment, and pregnant or lactating pwCF. Future research addressing these gaps, through incorporating routine clinical data, is crucial for improving clinical guidelines and optimizing dosing regimens, thereby advancing towards evidence-based utilization of CFTR modulators."

Protease IV (PIV) is a secreted protease shown to be important in mammalian cornea, lung, and wound models of infection. It also contributes to <i>P. aeruginosa</i> virulence in many invertebrate models. Previous studies have shown that the expression of the gene encoding PIV is higher at 25°C than at 37°C. Thus, we hypothesized that <i>piv</i> would be more important for <i>P. aeruginosa</i> virulence at 25°C than at 37°C. To test this, we first demonstrated that more PIV is secreted by <i>P. aeruginosa</i> PAO1 cells grown at 25°C than at 37°C. We then determined the survival of larvae of the greater wax moth <i>Galleria mellonella</i> infected by PAO1 and an isogenic Δ<i>piv</i> mutant at both 25°C and 37°C. We found no significant difference in virulence between PAO1 and Δ<i>piv</i> at either 25°C or 37°C, although both strains were more virulent at 37°C than 25°C as measured by a decrease in median survival time. <i>P. aeruginosa</i> possesses an arsenal of virulence factors besides PIV, and thus loss of this single virulence factor may not result in attenuation in the highly susceptible <i>G. mellonella</i> larvae.IMPORTANCEPathogenesis of the important opportunistic pathogen <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> is often investigated using model organisms. Larvae of the greater wax moth, <i>Galleria mellonella</i>, are a popular non-mammalian model organism for <i>P. aeruginosa</i> infections that have been used to study highly attenuated mutants and characterize their defects in virulence. Our study shows that small differences in the virulence of <i>P. aeruginosa</i>, such as those caused by deleting the gene encoding a single virulence factor, may not be detectable in the <i>G. mellonella</i> model of infection. This is an important finding for researchers considering the choice of model organisms for virulence studies."

Additionally, it seeks to clinically characterize children with CF (chCF) with different trajectories of HC costs. A retrospective observational study was conducted on data from the French CF Registry (FCFR) and the French National Claims Database (SNDS) linked from 2006 to 2021. HC costs related to CF diagnosis circumstances were estimated per year of life among chCF up to age 10. Group-based trajectory modeling was performed to identify subgroups with similar cost trajectories. Between 2006 and 2011, data from 1065 chCF were recorded in the FCFR. Nine hundred seventy-three (91.4%) were matched with SNDS, and 779 (73.1%) had at least 10 years of follow-up. During the first year, HC costs of chCF diagnosed with NBS were lower than for those diagnosed with MI and ANT (all p < 0.05). However, by the tenth year HC were no longer different between groups. Three groups with different cost trajectories were identified. Groups with the highest costs had a lower lung function at 6 and 10 years and the lowest weight and height z-scores at 2 and 10 years (all p < 0.05).

While there was no FIS response in undifferentiated (crypt enterocytes) F508del-CF enteroids, partially differentiated F508del-CF enteroids had a swelling response to forskolin (cAMP) and linaclotide (cGMP), which was ∼48%, and ∼67% of the response in healthy enteroids, respectively, and was prevented by a CFTR inhibitor.

This study evaluates the prevalence of pancreatic islet autoantibodies (AABs) by glycemic status and age, and assesses the risk of developing cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD) in people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF). A random-effects meta-analysis examined AABs against glutamic acid decarboxylase (GADA), insulin (IAA), islet cell (ICA), islet antigen-2 (IA-2A) and zinc transporter 8 (ZnT8A) in pwCF (CRD42023482663). Prevalence, odds ratios (OR), and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) were calculated with subgroup analyses by glycemic status and age. Analysis of 20 studies (2229 pwCF) found an overall islet AAB positivity rate of 4 % (CI: 2-9 %) and multiple positivity at 1 % (CI: 0-11 %). IAA had the highest prevalence at 6 % (CI: 3-14 %), and ICA the lowest at 1 % (CI: 0-9 %). Islet AAB prevalence trended higher in CFRD than non-CFRD patients and in children than adults. CFRD was significantly associated with islet AAB positivity, notably for GADA (OR 4.63, CI: 3.42-6.28), ICA (OR 3.57, CI: 1.05-12.18), and IA-2A (OR 2.36, CI: 1.29-4.34).

Temperature regulates the expression of many virulence factors that contribute to <i>P. aeruginosa</i>'s ability to cause infection, yet our mechanistic understanding of virulence factor thermoregulation is poor. In this study, we show that the virulence factor protease IV is thermoregulated at the level of transcription through the quorum sensing regulator, LasR. Mechanistic studies of virulence factor thermoregulation will expand our understanding of how <i>P. aeruginosa</i> experiences different environments, including the mammalian host. Our work also highlights the importance of growth conditions in studying gene regulation, as it better elucidates the regulation of protease IV by LasR, which was previously not well understood."

    "abstract": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance (<i>CFTR</i>) gene, resulting in the secretion of hyperviscous mucus. Infective exacerbations are a major determinant of morbidity and mortality in CF patients. These infections are clinically challenging, and antimicrobial treatment should effectively target the organisms and be delivered early to improve survival. Ceftobiprole is a fifth-generation cephalosporin antibiotic that is not indicated for the treatment of CF. However, due to its activity against common causes of infective exacerbations in CF such as <i>Staphylococcus aureus,</i> including MRSA, and <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> where resistance has not developed, it has utility for managing infective exacerbations. To describe the use of ceftobiprole in the treatment of infective exacerbations in CF. Ten patients with CF (age 24-63; six male and four female) were treated with ceftobiprole for infective exacerbations following discussion within the multi-disciplinary team. In most patients, ceftobiprole was given concomitantly with other antibiotics. All patients had positive sputum cultures for <i>S. aureus</i> (including nine MRSA), and seven patients had concomitant <i>P. aeruginosa</i> infection. Ceftobiprole treatment was associated with improved lung function, and markers of systemic inflammation decreased for most patients, with some variation. There was good tolerability in all but four patients. Ceftobiprole presents a therapeutic option for susceptible infections in CF patients with limited treatment options. Its broad-spectrum coverage may help to reduce polypharmacy. However, further clinical studies are needed."

    "abstract": "Iron deficiency (ID) is frequent in adult patients with cystic fibrosis (pwCF). The effect of elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor (ETI) on iron metabolism has rarely been reported. We aimed to study the trends and variables associated with iron store modulation under ETI. We conducted a prospective adult cohort in two referral centres for pwCF. Iron supplementation during the follow-up was an exclusion criterion. Clinical, biological data and pulmonary function tests were collected prospectively at ETI initiation (V0) and after 1 year of ETI (V12). The presence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in forced sputum was assessed at V0 and V12. 220 (87 women) pwCF among the 278 screened were included. At V0, ID prevalence was 58% and was significantly associated with female sex and lower forced expiratory volume (FEV1). At V12, ID prevalence decreased significantly from 58 to 31% (p = 0.001). A significant decrease of C reactive protein and total globulins was found at V12. 60% of patients with ID at V0 achieved normalization of iron status at V12 with a significant association with the increase of FEV1 (moderate size effect: 0.68). A lower decrease of C reactive protein was significantly associated with the onset of ID in a small sample of patients (p < 0.001). The disappearance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in sputum at V12 was not correlated to the evolution of iron status under ETI. ETI was associated with a decrease of ID prevalence, and improvement of pulmonary function and a correction of systemic inflammation."

    "abstract": "Bronchiectasis is a worldwide inflammatory disease with different epidemiology and heterogenous etiology. The disease burden is high for patients and economic costs can be immense. So far there are no special disease modifying drugs available for patients with bronchiectasis other than cystic fibrosis. With rising numbers of newly diagnosed patients (prevalence 120/100000 in Germany) due to different reasons (idiopathic, postinfectious, genetic, asthma, COPD etc.) the awareness for this once called orphan disease should rise - not only among pulmonologists but also among general care practitioners. This article focuses on diagnostic algorithms and multimodal treatment options based on the latest studies and the recently published German bronchiectasis guideline from May 2024. It outlines what general care practitioners can do for their patients, what they should consider when treating an exacerbation and that special surveillance of these patients is needed in centers with expertise in this disease due to its complexity. With upcoming treatment options just as disease modifying drugs like DDP-1 inhibitors or inhaled antibiotics one can expect a change in disease treatment and outcome. Therefore, it is more and more important to raise awareness for bronchiectasis starting at the very basis when patients present at their general care practitioner with recurring productive cough, exacerbations, and further cardinal symptoms of bronchiectasis disease."

This drug profile summarizes the role of inflammation in the pathophysiology of bronchiectasis. The mechanism of action of brensocatib in reducing neutrophil-related inflammation is described. We then summarize existing efficacy and safety data from Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies of brensocatib in patients with bronchiectasis, in which the rate of exacerbation was the primary endpoint. Finally, we summarize the current marketplace for brensocatib, including the unmet for effective therapies for bronchiectasis, and the status of other potential treatments undergoing clinical trials. Brensocatib is a first-in-class DPP1 inhibitor that shows promise as a treatment for patients with bronchiectasis."

Demographic and clinical data were recorded, and fat-soluble vitamin levels were analyzed at baseline, and at 6 and 12 months after starting treatment. Two groups were analyzed separately: patients receiving dual therapy lumacaftor/ivacaftor or tezacaftor/ivacaftor (Lum/Tez+Iva), and those on triple therapy with elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI). We found that treatment with ETI produced a significant increase in vitamin D and A levels within the first 6 months, which was maintained at 12 months. However, with dual therapy, we observed an increase only in vitamin A levels within the first 6 months, which was not maintained at 12 months. No differences were found in vitamin E serum levels between the groups."

However, their increasing use has been associated with potential adverse effects, including acute pancreatitis (AP). The exact prevalence of GLP-1 agonist-induced AP remains uncertain and reliable predictors for its onset have yet to be identified. We present 3 cases of class-associated predilection for GLP-1 analog-associated AP in patients with carrier states for hemochromatosis (HC) and cystic fibrosis. Case 1 is a heterozygous carrier for the <i>C282Y</i> HC pathogenic variant. Case 2 is a heterozygous carrier of the <i>Delta F508</i> deletion of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (<i>CFTR)</i> gene. Case 3 is compound heterozygous carrier of a single <i>CFTR</i> intron 9 poly T allele pathogenic variant (5T/7T/8T), as well as a single pathogenic variant of the <i>C282Y</i> HC gene. Our observation suggests that carrier states for cystic fibrosis and HC may predispose individuals to GLP-1 agonist-associated AP. Genetic testing for these carrier states should be considered among patients with GLP-1 agonist-associated AP to provide more support and data for this as a potential true risk factor."

This study aims to investigate characteristics, waiting list dynamics, and waiting list mortality of people with CF (pwCF) registered for liver transplantation within Eurotransplant countries, to understand and improve transplant outcomes for this group. We analysed Eurotransplant liver transplantation registration data (January 2007-December 2022), comparing pwCF to people with no CF (pwnoCF) and non-CF age/liver disease severity score (Lab-MELD) matched controls, with subgroup comparisons between pwCF receiving isolated liver transplantation (LiverTx) and combined liver-lung transplantation (Liver+LungTx). 215 out of 38,125 liver transplantation registrations were for pwCF. 65.1 % of the pwCF were listed for LiverTx and 34.9 % for Liver+LungTx. At registration, pwCF were younger (17.9 ± 0.8 vs. 55.0 ± 0.1; P < 0.05) and had lower Lab-MELD scores (10.0 ± 0.4 vs. 15.0 ± 0.0; P < 0.05) compared to pwnoCF. PwCF listed for LiverTx were younger (15.1 ± 0.9 vs. 26.0 ± 1.1; P < 0.05) and had higher Lab-MELD scores at transplantation (12.0 ± 1.0 vs. 9.0 ± 0.5; P < 0.05) compared to Liver+LungTx. PwCF had a higher 2-year waiting list mortality than non-CF matched controls (14.9 % vs. 0.0 %; P < 0.05). Within pwCF, mortality was higher for pwCF listed for Liver+LungTx than for LiverTx (30.7 % vs. 6.4 %; P < 0.05). CF represents a distinct indication for liver transplantation, with increased varying waiting list mortality risks across the different CF-groups, not adequately captured by standard liver disease severity scores. PwCF considered for liver transplantation require close monitoring as their disease severity and mortality risk are not well represented in the current allocation algorithm, necessitating adaptations to the organ allocation rules."

    "abstract": "Respirable silica exposure adversely affects lung tissue immunopathology, triggering oxidative bursts in macrophages and neutrophils, releasing Damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), including calprotectin proteins, S100A8, and S100A9. Calprotectin constitutes up to 45% of these innate immune cells, and serum levels of these alarmins correlate with inflammation, fibrosis, remodelling, and drug response in chronic diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease, asthma, and cystic fibrosis. The consequence of releasing calprotectin protein could trigger the pro-fibrotic effect of silicosis. This study aimed to investigate the role of calprotectin (S100A8/S100A9) as a pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic mediator in silica-induced lung fibrosis and evaluated the therapeutic potential of the calprotectin inhibitor, paquinimod. Using a mouse model of silicosis, silica exposure significantly elevated calprotectin expression, lung inflammation, and fibrosis, as evidenced by increased levels of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers, collagen deposition, and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). In vitro, stimulation of human bronchial fibroblasts with S100A8/S100A9 upregulated fibrotic markers (COL1A1 and α-SMA), which were reduced by inhibitors of TLR4 and RAGE receptors, as well as by paquinimod. Treatment with paquinimod effectively reduced these pathological changes, normalized calprotectin levels, decreased fibrosis scores, and attenuated NF-κB activation. These findings highlighted calprotectin's pivotal role in silica-induced lung fibrosis and inflammation, suggesting that its inhibition could be a promising therapeutic approach for silicosis and other fibro-inflammatory lung diseases. Further research is warranted to explore the precise mechanisms linking calprotectin to lung fibrosis and its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target."

These organoids, generated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), embryonic stem cells (ESCs), or adult stem cells, possess remarkable capabilities for self-renewal, differentiation into diverse intestinal cell types, and functional recapitulation of physiological processes, including nutrient absorption, epithelial barrier integrity, and host-microbe interactions. The utility of intestinal organoids has been extensively demonstrated in disease modeling, drug screening, and personalized medicine. Notable examples include iPSC-derived organoids, which have been effectively employed to model enteric infections, and ESC-derived organoids, which have provided critical insights into fetal intestinal development. Patient-derived organoids have emerged as powerful tools for investigating personalized therapeutics and regenerative interventions for conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), cystic fibrosis, and colorectal cancer. Preclinical studies involving transplantation of human intestinal organoids into murine models have shown promising outcomes, including functional integration, epithelial restoration, and immune system interactions. Despite these advancements, several challenges persist, particularly in achieving reproducibility, scalability, and maturation of organoids, which hinder their widespread clinical translation. Addressing these limitations requires the establishment of standardized protocols for organoid generation, culture, storage, and analysis to ensure reproducibility and comparability of findings across studies. Nevertheless, intestinal organoids hold immense promise for transforming our understanding of gastrointestinal pathophysiology, enhancing drug development pipelines, and advancing personalized medicine. By bridging the gap between preclinical research and clinical applications, these organoids represent a paradigm shift in the exploration of novel therapeutic strategies and the investigation of gut-associated diseases."

    "abstract": "Cystic fibrosis is a serious life-threatening hereditary disease that occurs due to a mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene (CFTR). Ivacaftor (IVA) is a drug that targets the mutated CFTR protein. IVA is highly hydrophobic (log P = 5.6) with poor aqueous solubility (0.05 µg/mL) and is formulated as an amorphous solid dispersion tablet under the brand name Kalydeco<sup>®</sup>. The recommended daily dose of Kalydeco<sup>®</sup> is twice per day with a high fat meal to aid in IVA's absorption. In this research, we studied the application of cyclodextrins (CDs) to improve the dissolution of IVA. Phase solubility studies between IVA and four different CDs (α-, β-, γ-, and hydroxypropyl-β-CD [HP-β-CD]) were conducted and a significant improvement in IVA's aqueous solubility with HP-β-CD was observed. Solid state characterizations confirmed the formation of IVA/HP-β-CD inclusion complexes. In vitro dissolution studies were conducted at pH = 6.8 and showed improvement in IVA's rate and extent of dissolution with IVA/HP-β-CD (1:2) complexes in comparison to uncomplexed IVA. In vivo pharmacokinetics in mice showed a 2-fold increase in area under the curve (AUC) after the oral administration of the IVA/HP-β-CD complex in comparison to Kalydeco tablets. In addition, HP-β-CD extended the release of IVA from the IVA/HP-β-CD complexes with a longer T<sub>max</sub> of 7.05 h compared to 2.96 h with Kalydeco<sup>®</sup> tablets. These results demonstrate that CD inclusion complexes of IVA using HP-β-CD can be a successful alternative approach to improving the solubility of IVA while extending its release."

Insulin therapy given to such patients was associated with improved weight and lung function in several small, uncontrolled trials but might increase treatment burden and cause hypoglycaemia. We aimed to assess whether insulin treatment improves weight and lung function when given to patients with cystic fibrosis with early glycaemic abnormality. CF-IDEA was a multicentre, randomised controlled trial conducted at five children's hospitals in Australia and one in the USA. Eligible participants were children with cystic fibrosis aged 5-18 years without cystic fibrosis-related diabetes and with peak glucose concentration on a five-point OGTT of 8·2-11·0 mmol/L (cystic fibrosis insulin deficiency stage 1) or ≥11·1 mmol/L (cystic fibrosis insulin deficiency stage 2). Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to insulin or observation. Randomisation was done using the biased coin method, followed by minimisation when the study groups became imbalanced by chance. Randomisation was stratified by glycaemic category (cystic fibrosis insulin deficiency stage 1 or 2), weight Z score (more than or equal to -0·61 or less than -0·61), and study centre. Participants in the insulin group received once-daily, long-acting insulin detemir by subcutaneous injection before breakfast, commencing at 0·1 units per kg per day, adjusted in 0·5-unit increments to achieve all fingerstick blood glucose concentrations between 4 mmol/L and 8 mmol/L. The primary outcomes were absolute changes in weight Z score, percentage predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 s (ppFEV<sub>1</sub>), and percentage predicted forced vital capacity (ppFVC), derived with generalised estimating equations and presented with two-sided 95% CIs. Severe hypoglycaemic events (defined as requiring outside assistance or causing reduced level of consciousness or seizure), insulin-related adverse events, and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) percentage time with blood glucose below 3·9 mmol/L were recorded as safety outcomes. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01100892, and is completed. Between Dec 6, 2010, and Feb 25, 2022, 109 participants were randomly assigned to observation (n=54) or insulin (n=55). Five participants withdrew after the baseline visit, and the analysis therefore included 104 participants (53 observation and 51 insulin); 95 participants completed the 12-month protocol and nine completed only 6 months. Baseline characteristics were similar between the groups; however, the observation group included 30 (57%) boys and 23 (43%) girls, whereas the insulin group included 23 (45%) boys and 28 (55%) girls. The median daily insulin dose at 12 months was 0·12 units per kg per day (range 0·05-0·41). There were no statistically or clinically significant differences between the observation and insulin groups in change in weight Z score (difference insulin minus observation 0·07 [95% CI -0·04 to 0·18]; p=0·20), change in ppFEV<sub>1</sub> (1·2 [-2·2 to 4·7]; p=0·48), or change in ppFVC (0·6 [-2·6 to 3·8]; p=0·72). Similarly, there were no significant differences in subgroup analyses by cystic fibrosis insulin deficiency stages 1 and 2. There were no episodes of severe hypoglycaemia or insulin-related adverse events, and we found no evidence of difference between the observation and insulin groups in CGM percentage time less than 3·9 mmol/L. Insulin treatment did not improve weight or lung function when given to children and adolescents with cystic fibrosis and early glycaemic abnormalities. Insulin treatment should not be given to those who do not meet OGTT criteria for cystic fibrosis-related diabetes.

Dietary intakes were assessed via 3-day food diaries collected at baseline (M0) and one year after ETI treatment initiation (M12). Over the first year of ETI treatment, Body Mass Index (BMI) significantly increased with a median BMI Z-score gain of 0.2 (IQR: 0.7) for children and median BMI gain of 1.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (IQR: 1.8) for adults. Notably, these gains occurred without a significant increase in median daily caloric intake (2216 kcal (IQR: 750) at M0 vs. 2266 (IQR: 733) kcal at M12). Pancreatic enzyme requirements and calprotectin decreased significantly with ETI (p < 0.001 and p < 0.01, respectively), indicating improved pancreatic function and intestinal inflammation in some patients. Seven patients became overweight after one year of ETI. ETI therapy enhances nutritional status in pwCF, independently of increased caloric intake. Further research is essential to refine dietary recommendations under ETI treatment, aiming to prevent overweight and obesity while optimizing health outcomes."

    "title": "Accounting for Inconsistent Use of Covariate Adjustment in Group Sequential Trials.",
    "abstract": "Group sequential designs in clinical trials allow for interim efficacy and futility monitoring. Adjustment for baseline covariates can increase power and precision of estimated effects. However, inconsistently applying covariate adjustment throughout the stages of a group sequential trial can result in inflation of type I error, biased point estimates, and anticonservative confidence intervals. We propose methods for performing correct interim monitoring, estimation, and inference in this setting that avoid these issues. We focus on two-arm trials with simple, balanced randomization and continuous outcomes. We study the performance of our boundary, estimation, and inference adjustments in simulation studies. We end with recommendations about the application of covariate adjustment in group sequential designs."

    "abstract": "Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a progressive, lethal, and incurable disease of the pulmonary vasculature. A previous genome-wide association study (GWAS) with Affymetrix microarray analysis data exhibited elevated histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein 3 (HINT3) in the lung samples of PAH compared to control subjects (failed donors, FD) and the positive correlations of HINT3 with deubiquitinase USP11 and B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2). In this study, we aim to investigate the roles and interplay of USP11 and HINT3 in the apoptosis resistance of PAH. The levels of USP11 and HINT3 were increased in the lungs of idiopathic PAH (IPAH) patients and Hypoxia/Sugen-treated mice. USP11 and HINT3 interacted physically, as shown by co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) assay in human pulmonary arterial endothelial cells (HPAECs). HINT3 was degraded by polyubiquitination, which was reversed by USP11. Furthermore, HINT3 interacted with the anti-apoptotic mediator, BCL2. Overexpression of USP11 increased BCL2 content, congruent to elevated lung tissue levels seen in IPAH patients and Hypoxia/Sugen-treated mice. Conversely, the knockdown of HINT3 function led to a depletion of BCL2. Thus, we conclude that USP11 stabilizes HINT3 activation, which contributes to endothelial apoptosis-resistance of pulmonary arterial endothelial cells in PAH. This can potentially be a novel therapeutic target for ubiquitination modulators for PAH."

    "abstract": "Pancreatic tuberculosis is a rare manifestation of extrapulmonary tuberculosis, often mimicking pancreatic cancer clinically and radiologically. We report a 26-year-old immunocompetent farmer from a tuberculosis-endemic area presenting with a two-month history of fever, night sweats, and significant weight loss. Although malignancy was suspected, contrast-enhanced computed tomography of the abdomen showed a complex lesion in the pancreatic body with central necrosis and an enlarged lymph node. Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography also revealed increased metabolic activity in the lesion. However, endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration produced caseous necrotic material, and cytology revealed necrotizing granulomas with multinucleated giant cells. Molecular testing identified <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>, and other supportive findings included an elevated adenosine deaminase level in the cystic fluid and a positive interferon-gamma release assay. The patient was initiated on a standard four-drug anti-tuberculosis regimen and showed rapid clinical improvement within two weeks. Follow-up imaging at six months demonstrated complete resolution of the pancreatic lesion with residual fibrosis, and the patient remained asymptomatic after completing a nine-month treatment course. This case highlights the importance of including pancreatic tuberculosis in the differential diagnosis of pancreatic masses, particularly in endemic areas. A multidisciplinary approach involving endoscopic sampling, histology, and molecular testing is required to differentiate pancreatic tuberculosis from cancer and to ensure timely management."

This study aimed to investigate the inheritance of certain markers in candidate pharmacogenes among healthy Saudis. DNA samples from 95 unrelated healthy Saudi participants were genotyped using the Affymetrix Axiom Precision Medicine Diversity Array. Thirty-eight variants in 15 pharmacogenes were analyzed based on their clinical relevance and lack of previous reporting in Saudi populations. Twenty-six of the 37 tested markers were undetected in the cohort. The selected variants in six genes [<i>DPYD</i> (rs1801268), <i>CACNA1S</i> (rs772226819), <i>EGFR</i> (rs121434568), <i>RYR1</i> (rs193922816), <i>CYP2B6</i> (rs3826711), and <i>MT-RNR1</i> (rs267606617, rs267606618, rs267606619)] were found to be non-existing among Saudis. In contrast, 11 variants and alleles in nine pharmacogenes were detected at varying frequencies. Notable findings included high frequencies of variants in <i>ATIC</i> [rs4673993, minor allele frequency (MAF) = 0.71)] and <i>SLC19A1</i> (rs1051266, MAF = 0.48) affecting methotrexate efficacy. Three alleles were identified in <i>CYP3A4</i>, including a common (<i>CYP3A4</i> rs2242480) and two rare alleles (*3 and *22). Another three markers [rs16969968 in <i>CHRNA5</i>, rs11881222 in <i>IFNL3</i> (<i>IL28B</i>), and <i>SLCO1B1*14</i>] were found to be highly distributed among the participants (MAF = 0.35, 0.30, and 0.14, respectively).

Statistically significant differences in allele frequencies were observed for eight variants between Saudi and African populations, five variants compared to East Asians, and two variants compared to Europeans. This study provides novel insights into the distribution of clinically relevant PGx variants in the Saudi population. The findings have implications for personalizing treatments for various conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis, cystic fibrosis, and hepatitis C. These data contribute to the development of population-specific PGx testing panels and treatment guidelines."

However, the adsorbed serum proteins and their cognate cell receptors for removing nanoparticles from the bloodstream have not been linked. Here we use a multi-omics strategy to identify the adsorbed serum proteins binding to specific liver macrophage receptors. We discovered six absorbed serum proteins that bind to two liver macrophage receptors. Nanoparticle physicochemical properties can affect the degree of the six serum proteins adsorbing to the surface, the probability of binding to cell receptors and whether the liver removes the nanoparticle from circulation. Identifying the six adsorbed proteins allowed us to engineer decoy nanoparticles that prime the liver to take up fewer therapeutic nanoparticles, enabling more nanoparticles for targeting extrahepatic tissues. Elucidating the molecular interactions governing the nanoparticle journey in vivo will enable us to control nanoparticle delivery to diseased tissues."

    "abstract": "Cystic fibrosis is a severe genetic disease caused by variants in the CFTR gene. Although it is a multisystem disease, respiratory involvement is the main cause of morbidity and mortality. Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator modulator (CFTRm) therapies have advanced the treatment of this disease by improving function of this protein. Ivacaftor, the first CFTRm, has been found to significantly improve lung function and quality of life in patients with certain gating variants. However, only a small percentage of patients in Spain are eligible for this treatment. Combinations of correctors and potentiators, such as lumacaftor-ivacaftor or tezacaftor-ivacaftor, have been developed for treatment of patients with the most frequent variant (F508del), although with limited benefits. Triple therapy with elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor has been found to significantly improve respiratory, gastrointestinal and nutritional outcomes as well as quality of life, thus changing the management of CF in eligible patients. The impact of triple therapy is also reflected in an increase in life expectancy and a decrease in mortality and lung transplantation. As regards hepatic and pancreatic involvement, while CFTR modulators have exhibited promising effects, further research is required. The use of CFTR modulators has also shifted nutritional status trends in patients with CF, reducing the risk of undernutrition but increasing the risk of obesity. The use of these drugs for treatment of less frequent variants and for potential antenatal treatment is currently being investigated. Despite these advances, there is still a subset of patients who are ineligible for treatment with modulators or highly effective therapy."

    "abstract": "A number of disease-modifying therapies have been introduced for people with cystic fibrosis (CF) over the past two decades. The cumulative effects of this changing landscape on cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD) are unclear. We examined trends in CFRD epidemiology over time using data from the U.S. Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Patient Registry (CFFPR). CFFPR data from 2003 to 2018 were queried to determine annual screening, incidence, and prevalence rates of CFRD. Individuals with incident CFRD were compared with individuals without CFRD. Survival analyses were performed to estimate the cumulative hazard of CFRD given predictors of interest over the 15 years of study. Data were also grouped into three time periods (2003-2008, 2009-2013, and 2014-2018) to investigate whether the hazard of developing CFRD varied over time. CFRD screening rates increased from 2003 to 2018, particularly in 10- to 18-year-olds. Although screening rates increased in adults, overall rates remained low. In 10- to 18-year-olds, the incidence of CFRD was stable over time, while incident cases in adults steadily decreased, approaching incident rates in adolescents. Despite this, the prevalence of CFRD has gradually increased in adults, likely reflecting increased longevity. Age, female sex, Black race, severe mutation class, liver disease, poorer lung function, pancreatic insufficiency, enteric feeds, and low and high BMI were all risk factors associated with CFRD. Findings support the need for the development of tailored CFRD screening algorithms and increased subspecialists to care for a growing population of adults with CF and CF-associated comorbidities."

    "abstract": "<i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> routinely causes chronic lung infection in individuals with muco-obstructive airway diseases (MADs). In MADs, <i>P. aeruginosa</i> forms antibiotic-tolerant biofilm-like aggregates within hyperconcentrated airway mucus. While the contribution of mucin hyper-concentration to antibiotic tolerance and bacterial aggregation has been described, less is known about the bacterial factors involved. We previously found that <i>P. aeruginosa</i> populations isolated from people with MADs exhibited significant variability in antibiotic tolerance. This variability is not explained by antibiotic resistance or the mucus environment, suggesting bacterial-driven mechanisms play a crucial role in treatment outcomes. Here, we investigated the contribution of flagellar motility to aggregate formation and tolerance by manipulating motility behaviors. Similar to prior studies, we found that loss of flagellar motility resulted in increased aggregation and tolerance to various antibiotics. We identified novel differential roles of the MotAB and MotCD stators, which power flagellar rotation, in antimicrobial tolerance and aggregate formation. In addition, we found that control of <i>fliC</i> expression was important for aggregate formation and antibiotic tolerance. Constitutive expression of <i>fliC</i> allowed <i>P. aeruginosa</i> to overcome entropic forces of mucin, antagonizing aggregate formation and increasing antibiotic efficacy. Lastly, we demonstrate that neutrophil elastase, an abundant antimicrobial protease in chronic lung infection, promotes antibiotic treatment failure by impairing flagellar motility leading to antibiotic-tolerant aggregate formation. These results underscore the crucial role of flagellar motility in aggregate formation and antibiotic tolerance, enhancing our understanding of how <i>P. aeruginosa</i> adapts to the MADs lung environment<i>.</i> Antibiotic treatment failure of <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> infection is a key driver of mortality in muco-obstructive airway diseases (MADs). The bacterial mechanisms that contribute to antibiotic tolerance in MADS infection are poorly understood. We investigated the impact of swimming motility behaviors on <i>P. aeruginosa</i> antibiotic tolerance in the context of the diseased mucus environment. Loss of flagellar motility, a common adaptation in chronic lung infection, drives antibiotic tolerance by promoting aggregate formation under physiologically relevant mucin concentrations. We uncovered novel roles of the flagellar stators in motility and mucus aggregate formation. Furthermore, neutrophil elastase, an abundant host-derived antimicrobial protease, promotes antibiotic tolerance and aggregation by impairing flagellar motility. These results further our understanding of the formation of antibiotic-tolerant aggregates within the MADs airway, revealing potential new targets to improve antibiotic treatment of chronic <i>P. aeruginosa</i> airway infection."

Exclusion criteria were: cystic fibrosis, primary ciliary dyskinesia, pregnancy, severe lung, heart, kidney disease, use of oral probiotics, use of intranasal probiotics in the last 6 months, sinus surgery in the last 6 months, lack of consent to participate in the study, antibiotic therapy in the last 2 months. Patients were scheduled to undergo nasal rinsing with a probiotic solution, with the following parameters assessed before and after the procedure: SNOT-22 scores and the severity of nasal lesions according to the Lund-Kennedy scale. In the group of patients with rhinitis, the ENS-6 questionnaire was also conducted and symptoms assessed on the VAS scale (visual analogue scale): nasal discharge, nasal obstruction, facial pain, impaired sense of smell, nasal irritation, nasal itching, and severity of crusting. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results:&lt;/b&gt; The study showed that nasal rinsing with a probiotic solution is well tolerated and does not cause any adverse effects. In both groups, a reduction in symptoms was observed based on the SNOT-22 questionnaire (p = 0.002 in GPA, ns - in rhinitis/ rhinosinusitis). According to the Lund-Kennedy scale, the reduction in the intensity of changes in both groups was statistically significant. In addition, patients with primary rhinitis or rhinosinusitis also experienced a reduction in nasal mucosa irritation and crusting intranasal (p&lt;0.05). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/b&gt; Probiotic nasal rinsing appears to have a beneficial effect on the condition of the nasal mucosa in patients with both primary and secondary (GPA-related) rhinosinusitis and is generally well tolerated."

    "abstract": "The small intestine is well known for its nutrient-absorbing enterocytes; yet equally crucial for homeostasis is a diverse set of secretory cells, all presumed to originate from the same intestinal stem cell. Despite their major roles in intestinal function and health, understanding how the full spectrum of secretory cell types arises remains a longstanding challenge, largely due to their comparative rarity. Here, we investigate the specification of a rare population of small intestinal epithelial cells found in rats and humans but not mice: CFTR high expressers (CHEs). Using pseudotime trajectory analysis of single-cell RNA-sequencing data from rat jejunum, we provide evidence that CHEs are specified along the secretory lineage and appear to employ a second wave of Notch-based signaling to distinguish themselves from other secretory cells. We validate the transcription factors directing these cells from crypt progenitors and demonstrate that Notch signaling is necessary to induce CHE fate in vivo and in vitro. Our findings suggest that Notch reactivation along the secretory lineage specifies CHEs, which may help regulate luminal pH and have direct relevance in cystic fibrosis pathophysiology."

Due to substantial progress in highly effective cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulator therapy, nearly everyone with CF now reaches adulthood, necessitating ongoing interdisciplinary medical care. Conversely, approximately 70% of children with asthma experience a resolution of symptoms as they reach adulthood. Factors contributing to the persistence of asthma into adulthood include the presence of severe asthma, diminished lung function in childhood and allergic comorbidities. Especially for young adults with severe asthma, continuous pneumological care including uninterrupted access to biologics, must be provided. During the transition process, considerations regarding career choices are pertinent for both patient groups. Additionally, issues related to family planning and prenatal diagnostics become particularly relevant for young adults with CF and should be addressed during the transition process. In both patient groups, an early and structured initiation of the transition process is essential. The use of checklists and transition plans can facilitate the transfer of critical information and ensure a seamless transition. Joint pediatric and internal medicine consultations foster trust and ensure medical quality. Ultimately, a successful transition should enable individuals with CF as well as those with asthma to assume responsibility for their condition and treatment, recognize clinical deterioration, and seek timely assistance."

The aims of this review are to highlight the key insights gained from monitoring the MCFC over 20 years, and to discuss the challenges and advantages of establishing such a cohort in a rare disease like cystic fibrosis. Adult people with cystic fibrosis were recruited from 2004 onward in Montreal, Canada, excluding those already diagnosed with cystic fibrosis-related diabetes. Clinical and biological results (including oral glucose tolerance tests) were recorded regularly. Findings from the MCFC contributed to a better understanding of cystic fibrosis-related diabetes pathophysiology (in particular, the joint roles of reduced insulin secretion and added insulin resistance) and its relationship with lung function. Over the years, we observed a shift towards overweight and obesity among cystic fibrosis patients, along with improved lung function. This could be due to improved cystic fibrosis care and to the introduction of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator modulators. We were also able to validate new, simplified screening modalities and management strategies (<i>e.g.</i> physical activity) for cystic fibrosis-related diabetes. The MCFC has contributed to the understanding of cystic fibrosis-related diabetes and informed best practice guidelines.

This review highlights key challenges and research priorities for addressing the health needs of an ageing CF population. A growing body of evidence underscores the heightened risks of cancers, cardiovascular diseases and changing nutritional and metabolic profiles as pwCF age. CFTR modulators have improved clinical outcomes, but their effects on inflammation, immunity and long-term disease trajectories remain incompletely understood. Nutritional management, particularly the implications of obesity and body composition, poses new challenges, as does the potential accelerated ageing of immune and pulmonary systems in CF. Emerging issues such as menopause in females with CF, lifetime antimicrobial resistance and the interplay between chronic inflammation and ageing further complicate the care landscape. The review emphasises the urgent need for multidisciplinary research programmes that integrate clinical, patient and community perspectives. Leveraging established CF registries, clinical trial networks and collaborations with ageing research frameworks is critical to addressing these challenges.

    "abstract": "The pathophysiology of atopic dermatitis (AD) involves cutaneous inflammation, predominantly mediated by innate immunity and T cells, with Immunoglobulin E (IgE) playing a marginal role in most patients. Over previous decades, however, there has been an ongoing debate regarding the relevance of IgE-mediated allergy testing in AD patients. Patients with AD have a defective skin barrier that facilitates a high inflammatory response to environmental antigens, placing them at greater risk for food allergies. Nevertheless, because these patients often produce very high levels of IgE, the positive predictive value of skin prick tests and specific IgE measurements is low; such tests should be performed only when there is a concordant immediate hypersensitivity reaction (i.e. urticaria or angioedema) rather than eczema. In recent years, numerous studies have emphasized the importance of maintaining oral exposure to foods in order to prevent the development or progression of food allergies in atopic patients. While acknowledging that food allergens may contribute to AD in certain cases, it is critical that patients understand the risk of developing IgE-mediated food allergies if they exclude allergenic foods from their diet. Ultimately, controlling AD while retaining these foods in the diet should be the goal for all patients."

Specialist palliative care may be beneficial, but it is unclear which patients are most appropriate for referral and when they should be referred. To identify a set of consensus referral criteria for specialist palliative care for patients with dementia. In this survey study using 3 rounds of Delphi surveys, an international, multidisciplinary panel of clinicians from 5 continents with expertise in the integration of dementia and palliative care were asked to rate 83 putative referral criteria (generated from a previous systematic review and steering committee discussion). Specialist palliative care was defined as an interdisciplinary team consisting of practitioners with advanced knowledge and skills in palliative medicine offering consultative services for specialist-level palliative care in (nonhospice) inpatient, outpatient, community, and home-based settings. Consensus was defined a priori as at least 70% agreement among experts. A criterion was coded as major if the experts advocated that meeting 1 criterion alone was satisfactory to justify a referral.

    "abstract": "Strict and facultative anaerobic bacteria are widely associated with both acute and chronic airway diseases. However, their potential role(s) in disease pathophysiology remains poorly understood due to inherent limitations of existing laboratory models and conflicting oxygen demands between anaerobes and host cells. To address these limitations, here, we describe a dual oxic-anoxic culture (DOAC) approach that maintains an oxygen-limited microenvironment at the apical epithelial interface while host cells are oxygenated basolaterally. This platform enables epithelial-anaerobe co-culture for ~48 h, and we demonstrate its utility by evaluating reciprocal interactions between the oxygen-sensitive anaerobic bacterium, <i>Fusobacterium nucleatum,</i> and oxygen-demanding airway epithelial cells at the transcriptional level. Using bulk RNAseq, we demonstrate that epithelial colonization results in altered gene expression by <i>F. nucleatum,</i> highlighted by the differential expression of genes associated with virulence, ethanolamine and lysine metabolism, metal uptake, and other transport processes. We also combine DOAC with single-cell RNA sequencing to reveal a cell type-specific transcriptional response of the airway epithelium to <i>F. nucleatum</i> infection, including the increased expression of inflammatory marker genes and cancer-associated pathways. Together, these data illustrate the versatility of DOAC while revealing new insights into anaerobe-host interactions and their mechanistic contributions to airway disease pathophysiology.IMPORTANCEConflicting oxygen demands between anaerobes and host cells present a significant barrier to <i>in vitro</i> modeling of how these cell types interact. To this end, the significance of our dual oxic-anoxic culture (DOAC) approach lies in its ability to maintain anaerobe and epithelial viability during co-culture, paving the way for new insights into the role(s) of anaerobic microbiota in disease. We use DOAC to interrogate reciprocal interactions between the airway epithelium and <i>Fusobacterium nucleatum</i>-an anaerobic commensal with pathogenic potential. Given its link to a range of diseases, from localized infections to various cancers, these data showing how <i>F. nucleatum</i> bacterium re-shapes its metabolism and virulence upon epithelial colonization provide new mechanistic insight into <i>F. nucleatum</i> physiology and how the host responds. We use <i>F. nucleatum</i> as our model, but the DOAC platform motivates additional studies of the gut, lung, and oral cavity, where host-anaerobe interactions and the underlying mechanisms of pathogenesis are poorly understood."

    "abstract": "The <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> LasR transcription factor plays a role in quorum sensing (QS) across phylogenetically distinct lineages. However, isolates with loss-of-function mutations in <i>lasR</i> (LasR- strains) are commonly found in diverse settings, including infections where they are associated with worse clinical outcomes. In LasR- strains, the LasR-regulated transcription factor RhlR can also be stimulated by the activity of the two-component system PhoR-PhoB in low-inorganic phosphate (Pi) conditions. Here, we demonstrate a novel link between LasR and PhoB in which the absence of LasR increases PhoB activity at physiological Pi concentrations and increases the Pi concentration necessary for PhoB inhibition. PhoB activity was also less sensitive to repression by Pi in mutants lacking different QS regulators (RhlR and PqsR) and in mutants lacking genes required for QS-induced phenazine production, suggesting that decreased phenazine production is one reason for increased PhoB activity in LasR- strains. In addition, the CbrA-CbrB two-component system, which can be more active in LasR- strains, was necessary for increased PhoB activity in LasR- strains, and loss of the CbrA-CbrB-controlled translational repressor Crc was sufficient to activate PhoB in LasR+ <i>P. aeruginosa</i>. Phenazines and CbrA-CbrB affected PhoB activity independently. The ∆<i>lasR</i> mutant also had PhoB-dependent growth advantages in the Pi-deplete medium and increased virulence-associated gene expression at physiological Pi, in part through reactivation of QS. This work suggests PhoR-PhoB activity may contribute to the fitness and virulence of LasR- <i>P. aeruginosa</i> and subsequent clinical outcomes.IMPORTANCELoss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding the <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> quorum sensing (QS) regulator LasR occur frequently and are associated with worse clinical outcomes. We have found that LasR- <i>P. aeruginosa</i> have elevated PhoB activity at physiological concentrations of inorganic phosphate (Pi). PhoB activity promotes Pi acquisition as well as the expression of QS and virulence-associated genes. Previous work has shown that PhoB induces RhlR, another QS regulator, in a LasR- mutant in low-Pi conditions. Here, we demonstrate a novel relationship wherein LasR represses PhoB activity through the production of phenazines and Crc-mediated translational repression. This work suggests PhoB activity may contribute to the increased virulence of LasR- <i>P. aeruginosa</i>."

    "title": "Altered nasal and oral microbiomes define pediatric sickle cell disease.",
    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a chronic blood disorder that disrupts multiple organ systems and can lead to severe morbidity. Persistent and acute symptoms caused by immune system dysregulation in individuals with SCD could contribute to disease either directly or indirectly via dysbiosis of commensal microbes and increased susceptibility to infection. Here, we explored the nasal and oral microbiomes of children with SCD (cwSCD) to uncover potential dysbiotic associations with the blood disorder. Microbiota collected from nasal and oral swabs of 40 cwSCD were compared to eight healthy siblings using shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Commensal taxa were present at similar levels in the nasal and oral microbiome of both groups. However, the nasal microbiomes of cwSCD contained a higher prevalence of Pseudomonadota species, including pathobionts such as <i>Yersinia enterocolitica</i> and <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i>. Furthermore, the oral microbiome of cwSCD displayed lower α-diversity and fewer commensal and pathobiont species compared to the healthy siblings. Thus, subtle but notable shifts seem to exist in the nasal and oral microbiomes of cwSCD, suggesting an interaction between SCD and the microbiome that may influence health outcomes. The oral and nasal cavities are susceptible to environmental exposures including pathogenic microbes. In individuals with systemic disorders, antibiotic exposure, changes to the immune system, or changes to organ function could influence the composition of the microbes at these sites and the overall health of individuals. Children with sickle cell disease (SCD) commonly experience respiratory infections, such as pneumonia or sinusitis, and may have increased susceptibility to infection because of disrupted microbiota at these body sites. We found that children with SCD (cwSCD) had more pathobiont bacteria in the nasal cavity and reduced bacterial diversity in the oral cavity compared to their healthy siblings. Defining when, why, and how these changes occur in cwSCD could help identify specific microbial signatures associated with susceptibility to infection or adverse outcomes, providing insights into personalized treatment strategies and preventive measures."

    "title": "Clinical Disorders in Cystic Fibrosis That Affect Emergency Procedures-A Case Report and Review.",
    "abstract": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a multisystemic disease caused by a genetic defect, namely a mutation in the CFTR gene, that results in the production of an abnormal protein that regulates the flow of chloride ions through epithelial cells, leading to the dehydration of secreted mucus and changes in its biological properties. Chronic inflammation and recurrent respiratory infections progressively damage lung tissue, leading to respiratory and cardiorespiratory failure. This study aims to present a clinical case and explore the clinical changes in CF that may influence the provision of pre-hospital first aid. The study presents a case report of a 23-year-old CF patient undergoing evaluation for lung transplantation, infected with <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> and <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> with the MSSA phenotype, and in a severe condition due to infectious exacerbation. Despite antibiotic treatment, the patient's condition deteriorated, leading to respiratory failure and cardiac arrest. Emergency measures were taken to maintain airway patency-the patient was sedated, intubated, and connected to a ventilator. CF involves systemic complications that, during exacerbations, may require urgent interventions. Cystic fibrosis is associated with multiple systemic complications, some of which may, during exacerbations, require emergency medical interventions. Providing care to this patient group involves specific procedures addressing the consequences of the underlying disease. Due to increasing survival rates and the emergence of new phenotypes, there is a need for the continuous education of medical personnel, including emergency responders, regarding the management of genetically determined diseases. This study underscores the importance of recognizing CF's complex nature and adapting emergency care accordingly to ensure timely and effective intervention in life-threatening situations."

    "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> The global health burden of chronic respiratory diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) affects billions of people and is associated with high levels of healthcare expenditure. Conventional therapies (bronchodilators and corticosteroids) provide symptomatic benefit but take no effect on disease progression, demonstrating the need to develop new therapies. Emerging therapies treat the underlying mechanisms of these chronic diseases, which provide symptomatic relief and benefit the underlying disease. <b>Methods:</b> This review assesses the evolution of therapeutic interventions for chronic lung diseases from a series of established inhaled combination therapies to biologics, gene therapy, and even AI-based stratification of therapies for patients. In addressing these issues, we review the mechanisms of action, evidence of efficacy, and clinical trial evidence, while discussing access issues affecting the implementation of these therapies and ethical issues in relation to their use. <b>Results:</b> The review highlights recent developments in treatment approaches, such as gene therapies aimed at cystic fibrosis mutations, advanced drug delivery pathways for more accurate targeting, and stem cell-based therapies designed to replace damaged lung tissue. These developments have the potential to improve outcomes for chronic lung diseases, but the challenges, including a lack of access, adequate patient selection, and long-term safety, need to be addressed. <b>Conclusions:</b> New therapies offer tremendous potential, but their transition from laboratory to clinic still face numerous barriers including access, regulation, and a need for personalized therapy approaches. The review indicates that future research should develop strategies to reduce barriers to access, improve distribution, and improve clinical guidelines to successfully implement these new therapies."

    "abstract": "<b>Background/Objectives:</b> Patients with chronic lung diseases, such as cystic fibrosis, were considered a risk group for a severe course of coronavirus disease 2019 at the beginning of the pandemic. However, mounting evidence suggests that this group may not face an elevated risk for a severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. <b>Methods</b>: Here, we present data on the incidence and clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 infections in a single pediatric CF centre in Austria. Clinical variables were analyzed for their potential impact on disease acquisition and severity. A total of 135 young people with CF were assessed from February 2020 until December 2022. <b>Results</b>: Eighty-four patients were infected with SARS-CoV-2, out of which nine patients reported re-infection, resulting in 93 SARS-CoV-2 infections. Most infections, 76/93 (82%), occurred during the period of omicron variant predominance. Higher body mass index and respiratory colonization with <i>Haemophilus influenzae</i> before the beginning of the pandemic were significantly associated with the risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection. All patients had an uncomplicated COVID-19 course, regardless of the SARS-CoV-2 variant and COVID-19 vaccine status at infection. The most frequent symptoms were rhinitis (53%), fatigue (49%), cephalea (43%), and fever (38%). Neither oxygen therapy nor hospitalization were needed for any of the patients. Lung function parameters (FEV1, FVC, FEF50, LCI), both in the early post-viral as well as late post-viral stages, were not significantly impacted by SARS-CoV-2 infections. No long-term post-COVID-19 effects were reported. <b>Conclusions</b>: Our single-centre experience suggests that the course of SARS-CoV-2 infections in children and adolescents with CF is primarily mild and uncomplicated."

    "abstract": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a life-threatening disorder caused by mutations in the CFTR gene, leading to defective chloride ion transport and thickened mucus in the respiratory and gastrointestinal systems. CFTR modulators, including ivacaftor, lumacaftor, tezacaftor, and elexacaftor, have improved patient outcomes, but interindividual pharmacokinetic variability and potential drug-drug interactions require therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) for optimal efficacy and safety. In this context, a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method has been developed and validated for the simultaneous quantification of CFTR modulators and their major active metabolites in human plasma to support pharmacokinetic studies and routine TDM. The multiplex LC-MS/MS assay was established using plasma protein precipitation, followed by chromatographic separation on an Xselect HSS T3 (Waters<sup>®</sup>) column and positive electrospray ionization mode detection. The method was validated based on FDA and EMA guidelines for specificity, linearity, accuracy (89.8-107.8%), repeatability (1.1-8.1%), intermediate fidelity (1.3-10.9%), matrix effects, and stability, demonstrating a robust performance with excellent precision and accuracy. International interlaboratory comparisons confirmed the reliability of the assay. The developed method can be applied for the clinical monitoring of caftors' plasma concentrations and preliminary data suggest that it can also be applied to alternative matrices, such as breast milk. This method will serve to characterize caftors' pharmacokinetic variability and monitor drug-drug interactions to further refine personalized dosing strategies and enhance precision medicine treatments for patients with CF."

    "abstract": "Defective CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) is pathognomonic for cystic fibrosis (CF), which is characterized by an accumulation of tenacious secretions in pulmonary airways, as well as by abnormal ductal secretions in other organs, including the pancreas and prostate. The advent of CFTR modulating therapies has markedly improved the clinical status and survival of CF patients, primarily attributable to improved lung function. Previous publications reported that a decline in CFTR function was associated with a decline in activity and expression of the enzyme N-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfatase (Arylsulfatase B; ARSB). ARSB removes 4-sulfate groups from N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfate residues and is required for the degradation of chondroitin 4-sulfate (chondroitin sulfate A) and dermatan sulfate, two sulfated glycosaminoglycans which accumulate in cystic fibrosis. Declines in both ARSB and in CFTR have been associated with the development of malignancies, including prostate malignancy. The experiments in this report show that similar effects on invasiveness are present when either CFTR or ARSB is inhibited in human prostate epithelial cells, and these effects resemble findings detected in malignant prostate tissue. The effects of CFTR inhibition are reversed by treatment with recombinant human ARSB in prostate cells. These results suggest that treatment by rhARSB may benefit patients with cystic fibrosis and prostate cancer."

This route lowers the required dose, minimizing side effects, which could be beneficial in treating cystic fibrosis. In this study, a nano-spray-drying technique was applied to prepare CD/IBU complexes using sulfobutylether-β-cyclodextrin (SBECD) or (2-Hydroxy-3-N,N,N-trimethylamino)propyl-beta-cyclodextrin chloride (QABCD) as carriers as well as mannitol (MAN) and leucine (LEU) as aerosolization excipients. Various investigation techniques were utilized to examine and characterize the samples, including a Master Sizer particle size analyzer, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). We applied in vitro Andersen Cascade Impactor measurements and in silico simulation analysis to determine the sample's aerodynamic properties. We also performed in vitro dissolution and diffusion tests. Applying formulations with optimal aerodynamic properties, we achieved an improved ~50% fine particle fraction values based on the Andersen Cascade Impactor measurements. The in vitro dissolution and diffusion studies revealed rapid IBU release from the formulations; however, the QABCD-based sample exhibited reduced membrane diffusion compared to SBECD due to the formation of electrostatic interactions."

    "abstract": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations in the <i>cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator</i> (<i>CFTR</i>) gene. While CRISPR-based <i>CFTR</i> editing approaches have shown proof-of-concept for functional rescue in primary airway basal cells, induced pluripotent stem cells, and organoid cultures derived from patients with CF, their efficacy remains suboptimal. Here, we developed the CuFi<sup>Cas9(Y66S)eGFP</sup> reporter system by integrating spCas9 and a non-fluorescent Y66S eGFP mutant into CuFi-8 cells, an immortalized human airway epithelial cell line derived from a patient with CF with homozygous F508del mutations. These cells retain the basal cell phenotype in proliferating cultures and can differentiate into polarized airway epithelium at an air-liquid interface (ALI), enabling both visualized detection of gene editing and electrophysiological assessment of <i>CFTR</i> functional restoration. Using this system, recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV)-mediated homology-directed repair (HDR) was evaluated in proliferating cultures. A correction rate of 13.5 ± 0.8% was achieved in a population where 82.3 ± 5.6% of cells were productively transduced by AAV.eGFP630g2-CMVmCh, an rAAV editing vector with an mCherry reporter. Dual-editing of F508del <i>CFTR</i> and Y66S <i>eGFP</i> was explored using AAV.HR-eGFP630-F508(g03) to deliver two templates and single guide RNAs. eGFP<sup>+</sup> (Y66S-corrected) cells and eGFP<sup>-</sup> (non-corrected) cells were sorted via fluorescence-activated cell sorting and differentiated at an ALI to assess the recovery of CFTR function. Despite a low F508 correction rate of 2.8%, ALI cultures derived from the eGFP<sup>-</sup> population exhibited 25.2% of the CFTR-specific transepithelial Cl<sup>-</sup> transport observed in CuFi-ALI cultures treated with CFTR modulators. Next-generation sequencing revealed frequent co-editing at both genomic loci, with sixfold higher F508 correction rate in the eGFP<sup>+</sup> cells than eGFP<sup>-</sup> cells. In both populations, non-homology end joining predominated over HDR. This reporter system provides a valuable platform for optimizing editing efficiencies in proliferating airway basal cells, particularly for development of strategies to enhance HDR through modulation of DNA repair pathways."

To determine whether self-reported baseline FTS use among people who use drugs (PWUD) was associated with overdose risk reduction behaviors and nonfatal overdose over a 28-day follow-up. Multisite, observational cohort study of PWUD conducted from May to December 2023 as an ancillary study of the HEALing Communities Study, which consists of fixed and mobile direct service provision sites in 14 community partner organizations distributing FTS. Participants lived in Kentucky, New York, or Ohio and reported using heroin, fentanyl, cocaine, methamphetamine, or nonprescribed opioids, benzodiazepines, or stimulants within 30 days before baseline. Participants were followed up for a maximum of 37 days. Baseline FTS use. The primary outcome was a composite score measuring the self-reported number and frequency of using 8 overdose risk reduction behaviors. Secondary outcomes included multiple measures (eg, self-reported nonfatal overdose). The study included 732 participants (median [IQR] age, 41 [34.0-48.0] years; 369 [50.4%] male; 64 [8.9%] Black or African American, 587 [81.3%] White, and 71 [9.8%] other races); 414 reported baseline FTS use and 318 did not. Compared with nonusers, a higher percentage of baseline FTS users were from Ohio and White, while a lower percentage were from New York and Hispanic and/or Black. In adjusted analyses, PWUD who used FTS had a mean daily composite score for overdose risk reduction behaviors that was 0.86 (95% CI, 0.34-1.38) units higher across follow-up compared with nonusers (score for FTS users, 7.37; nonusers, 6.51). There was no difference in self-reported nonfatal overdoses between the 2 groups (mean daily risk for FTS users, 0.02; nonusers, 0.02; risk ratio, 1.20; 95% CI, 0.70-2.06). In this cohort study, baseline FTS use was associated with greater engagement in overdose risk reduction behaviors during follow-up, but not with the risk of nonfatal overdose during follow-up, suggesting PWUD who use FTS may also engage in a broader set of harm reduction strategies."

Initially described for their antimicrobial function, NETs now play a part in the fundamental processes of cancer biology, including cancer initiation, metastatic dissemination, and immune evasion strategies. NETs hijack anti-tumor immunity by entrapping circulating cancer cells, fostering the growth of tumors, and reorganizing the tumor microenvironment such that it is pro-malignancy. Emerging evidence emphasizes the role of NETosis coupled with non-coding RNAs-long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs)-as key regulators of gene expression and controllers of processes vital for cancer growth, such as immune response and programmed cell death processes like apoptosis, necroptosis, pyroptosis, and ferroptosis. Aberrantly expressed non-coding RNAs have been attributed to immune dysregulation and excessive NET production, promoting tumor growth. NETs are also associated with a myriad of pathological conditions, such as autoimmune disorders, cystic fibrosis, sepsis, and thrombotic disorders. New therapeutic approaches-such as DNase therapy and PAD4 inhibitors-target NET production and their degradation to modify immune function and the efficiency of immunotherapies. Further clarification of the intricate interactions of NETosis, lncRNAs, and miRNAs has the potential to establish new strategies for the suppression of the growth of tumors and preventing immune evasion. This review seeks to elucidate the interactions between NETosis and the regulatory networks involving non-coding RNAs that significantly contribute to the immunopathogenesis of cancer."

    "abstract": "The leading cause of death for people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF) continues to be due to respiratory-related illnesses. Both wound repair and immune cell responses are dysregulated in the CF airways, creating a cycle of unresolved injury and perpetuating inflammation. PwCF are predisposed to colonization and infections with opportunistic bacteria like <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa)</i>, the most common adult pathogen in CF. <i>Pa</i> possesses key virulence factors that can exacerbate chronic inflammation and lung injury. With the approval of highly effective modulator therapies like elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI), pwCF eligible for ETI have seen drastic improvements in lung function and clinical outcomes, including an increased life expectancy. While modulator therapies are improving bronchial epithelial cellular processes in wound repair and some areas of immunity, many of these processes do not reach a non-CF baseline state or have not been thoroughly studied. The effect of modulator therapy on <i>Pa</i> may lead to a reduction in infection, but in more longitudinal studies, there is not always eradication of <i>Pa</i>, and colonization and infection frequency can return to pre-modulator levels over time. Finally, in this review we explore the current state of additional treatments for CF lung disease, independent of CFTR genotype, including anti-inflammatories, phage-therapies, and <i>Pa</i> vaccines."

China produced the highest number of publications (<i>n</i> = 535, 21.2%, TLCS = 459), followed by the United States (<i>n</i> = 529, 21%, TLCS = 3,527) and Japan (<i>n</i> = 270, 10.7%, TLCS = 1,279), with the United States exerting the greatest influence. The UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SYSTEM (<i>n</i> = 164) and HARVARD UNIVERSITY (<i>n</i> = 141) contributed the largest bodies of work. The most prolific authors in this domain are BARGAGLI E (<i>n</i> = 45), MAHER TM (<i>n</i> = 42), and MARTINEZ FJ (<i>n</i> = 32). The AMERICAN JOURNAL OF RESPIRATORY AND CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE is widely regarded as the leading journal in this field. In recent years, research has increasingly focused on macrophages, computed tomography, and Muc5b promoter polymorphism, among other areas. The concept of \"double blind\" reflects the translational trend of biomarkers toward clinical applications, particularly their potential utility in acute exacerbations of pulmonary fibrosis, interstitial pulmonary fibrosis, cystic pulmonary fibrosis, and radiation-induced pulmonary fibrosis. The clinical application of gene and imaging biomarkers achieved through the integration of multiple parameters and multi-omics fusion represents a promising future trend and emerging hotspot in pulmonary fibrosis biomarker research."

    "title": "Italian EoExpert panel recommendation for disease control, switching criteria, and follow-up in eosinophilic esophagitis from pediatric to adult age.",
    "abstract": "Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic, progressive type 2 inflammatory disorder of the esophagus, characterized by abnormal eosinophil accumulation in esophageal epithelium. Undiagnosed or undertreated EoE leads to increased risk of fibrostenosis, strictures, and food impaction due to persistent inflammation, deeply impacting patients' health-related quality of life (HRQoL). To gather insights on comprehensive assessment of EoE, comprising clinical, endoscopic, histological outcomes, adaptive behaviors and HRQoL; to define proper evaluation of disease control and impact of continuous versus noncontinuous treatment to reach full disease control. Finally, to validate an algorithm for disease control, switching criteria, and follow-up. Literature review, survey, and panel expert opinion building by a multidisciplinary Italian EoExpert Panel (EoExpert) of nine specialists from various Italian institutions. Non-systematic literature review, followed by a survey including 21 questions on the different topics. Results were then discussed and validated by EoExpert. The current diagnostic pathway often does not allow early detection of EoE patients, especially in the presence of adaptive behaviors and unawareness of EoE best practices. In addition, there is a lack of a shared \"control\" definition. EoExpert reviewed, shared, and recommended two novel management tools for EoE, represented by I.M.P.A.C.T. Questionnaire to uncover adaptive behaviors and S.C.O.P.E. (Symptoms Control, Observation, Pathological Evaluation) scheme for comprehensive treatment efficacy evaluation. EoExpert's recommendations were gathered and turned into a therapeutic management algorithm for the definition of disease control and switching criteria. This document provides a standardized approach to EoE management in pediatric and adult settings, highlighting the importance of timely diagnosis in a multidisciplinary setting, of using unified criteria for assessment of disease control through the adoption of a comprehensive approach and of following up patients. These recommendations highlight the critical role of increased awareness and standardized care in EoE clinical setting for lifelong management."

    "title": "Pregnancy Outcomes in 53 Female Lung Transplant Recipients.",
    "abstract": "Limited data exists to inform and appropriately counsel female lung transplant (LuT) recipients regarding post-transplant pregnancy. What are the modifiable factors that impact pregnancy outcomes in female LuT recipients? Retrospective observational analysis was performed on female LuT recipients who reported post-transplant pregnancies to the Transplant Pregnancy Registry International (TPRI). Fifty-three recipients transplanted from 1991-2021 reported 72 pregnancies to TPRI. Predominant indications for transplant were cystic fibrosis (60%) and pulmonary hypertension (19%). Contraceptive use post-transplant was 36%. The majority of recipients (54%) had unplanned pregnancies. The livebirth rate was 62% resulting in 46 livebirths. Approximately 60% were premature (<37 weeks gestational age, GA) and low birth weight (LBW, <2500 grams). Birth defects were seen in 7 (16%) children; none with mycophenolic acid (MPA) embryopathy. Three neonatal deaths resulted from extreme prematurity; 43 remaining children are healthy. Twenty recipients (38%) have died a median of 23.6 years post-LuT. Recipients with transplant-to-conception interval ≤2 years had no difference in mortality compared to >2 years (HR 1.26 95% CI 0.50-3.12, p=0.625). Recipients whose first pregnancy post-transplant was unplanned had lower survival (HR 7.02, 95% CI 1.35-36.45, p=0.020). Newborns of LuT recipients with planned compared to unplanned pregnancies have higher median GA (36.9 versus 34 weeks, p=0.025) and birthweight (2639 versus 2155 grams, p=0.047), and significantly lower risk of LBW for singletons (OR 0.26, 95% CI 0.07-0.94, p=0.036). Successful pregnancy after lung transplantation is achievable, however not without risks for mother and offspring. Planned pregnancies resulted in higher GA and birth weight liveborn and had lower post-pregnancy mortality. TPRI data show 54% of recipients reported unplanned pregnancies, an obvious area for improvement. Planning pregnancy is the most modifiable factor for mitigating risks."

    "title": "Validation of a Cystic Fibrosis Co-Culture Model for the Identification of Dual Acting Compounds with Antibiotic and Antibiotic Adjuvant Properties.",
    "abstract": "Infections in the lungs of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients are often polymicrobial in nature, typically comprising <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> and <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i><i>.</i> Compounds that act as an antimicrobial agent against one of these pathogens, and as an antibiotic adjuvant against the other, could provide a valuable approach to treating such infections, however a model that mimics the unique environment found with the CF lung is required for the identification and characterization of such molecules. To address this, we employed a <i>S. aureus</i>/<i>P. aeruginosa</i> coculture screening model in synthetic sputum, and identified compounds from our in-house library that simultaneously have potent anti-<i>S. aureus</i> activity, and potentiate colistin against colistin-resistant <i>P. aeruginosa</i>. The two lead compounds, 12F1 and 12G9, control growth of both species when dosed alongside sub-inhibitory concentrations of colistin, highlighting the potential of using a single molecule as both an antibiotic and antibiotic adjuvant to target multiple species in polymicrobial infections, as well as the importance of conducting activity screens in clinically relevant media."

Among PwCF, does preparedness for LTx and knowledge about LTx improve by reading personal narratives from CF LTx recipients (\"CF Stories\")? Adults with CF were recruited and presented with online CF Stories. Pre- and post-intervention questionnaires assessed LTx preparedness, knowledge, and decisional conflict. Deductive thematic analysis of study visits was conducted. Twenty-five participants were included. Pre-intervention, 24 % (6/25) reported feeling \"very prepared\" to discuss LTx. Among the remaining 19, preparedness improved post-intervention for 74 % (n = 14, 95 % CI: 51-88 %), with 42 % (n = 8, 95 % CI: 23-64 %) transitioning to feeling \"very prepared.\" Baseline transplant knowledge was high (100 % questions correct) among 48 % (12/25) of participants; among the remaining 13, 92 % (n = 12, 95 % CI: 67-99 %) scored 100 % post-intervention. Decisional conflict improved for 67 % of participants (16/24), with a mean individual Decisional Conflict Scale change of -9.4 (95 % CI: -2.8, -15.9; p = 0.01). Thematic analysis revealed that participants valued practical LTx insights and relatable stories, identifying key medical information for LTx discussions. CF Stories improved knowledge and preparedness for LTx discussions. Personal narratives could enhance preparedness for LTx discussions and decision-making for PwCF."

    "title": "Sweat conductivity test - can it be a cheaper alternative to sweat chloride analysis for diagnosis of cystic fibrosis in low resource setting?",
    "abstract": "Background & objectives Availability of sweat chloride analysis, the gold standard test for diagnosis of Cystic Fibrosis (CF) faces significant challenges in India. This study aimed to compare sweat conductivity using Sweat-Chek™ Sweat Analyzer against sweat chloride analysis using the 926 Sherwood chloride analyser and assess if sweat conductivity test can guide CF diagnosis in resource-poor settings. Methods In this retrospective study sweat chloride analysis and sweat conductivity were simultaneously performed on samples collected via Macroduct® system from patients referred for sweat testing. CF diagnosis was based on sweat chloride levels: ≥60 mmol/l confirmed CF, 30-59 mmol/l was borderline, and <30 mmol/l excluded CF. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV), and area under curve (AUC) were calculated via ROC curve. Spearman's rho was employed to analyse the correlation between methods. Results Both tests were performed on 118 children of which 106 samples were adequately collected. CF was diagnosed in 11 children. Sweat conductivity ≥ 80 mmol/l diagnosed CF with 100 per cent sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV. Likewise, a value ≤ 49 mmol/l predicted absence of CF with 100 per cent sensitivity, 91.36 per cent specificity, 78.13 per cent PPV, and 100 per cent NPV. Spearman's rho of 0.93 (P< 0.001) showed a strong correlation between the two methods. Intermediate conductivity values also correlated well (rs 0.62, P< 0.003) with intermediate sweat chloride levels. Interpretations & conclusions Sweat conductivity reliably identified CF in the study population including those children with borderline levels, suggesting the possibility of its use in resource-limited settings where sweat chloride analyzers are unavailable."

    "title": "Elexacaftor/Tezacaftor/Ivacaftor Population Pharmacokinetics in Pediatric Patients With Cystic Fibrosis.",
    "abstract": "Elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI) significantly improves treatment outcomes for people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF) with at least one F508del allele. In 2023, the Food and Drug Administration approved ETI for children with CF aged 2-5 years. However, real-world pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic data for ETI in pediatric and adult populations are still limited. This study aimed to characterize the population PK of ETI in children with CF (chCF) and evaluate current dosing recommendations. Population PK modeling was conducted using Monolix software on 150 ETI concentrations obtained from therapeutic drug (TDM) monitoring in 96 children with CF aged 2-18 years, as part of the MODUL-CF study. Area under the curve was derived from individual Bayesian pharmacokinetic estimates. A one-compartment model with a lag time, first-order absorption, and elimination best described the PK of elexacaftor/ivacaftor, while the PK of tezacaftor followed a one-compartment model with first-order absorption and elimination. A large between-subject variability was observed. The effect of body weight was significant on apparent clearance and volume of distribution parameters using allometric scaling. Children weighing 30-40 kg who received the adult-recommended dose showed higher drug exposure compared to adults with cystic fibrosis. This is the first study to describe the population pharmacokinetics of ETI in chCF aged 2-18 years, revealing high between-subject variability for all three drugs. In this context, TDM is likely essential for managing ETI exposure levels and guiding dosing adjustments. The appropriateness of current dosing recommendations for children under 12 years old weighing 30-40 kg remains to be clarified."

    "abstract": "<b><i>Background:</i></b> Studies investigating the safety and efficacy of automated insulin delivery (AID) systems in people with cystic fibrosis-related diabetes are limited. There are no published studies investigating the tubeless Omnipod 5 (OP5) AID system. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> This dual-center retrospective cohort study compared 14 days of baseline continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data with days 1-90 and 91-180 post-OP5 initiation. Multivariable mixed-effects linear regression models were used to assess changes in glycemic metrics. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Among the 26 individuals with sufficient data initiating OP5, 65% were female, with a median age of 27.3 years and median diabetes duration of 10.9 years. Six (23%) had a history of solid organ transplant, and 2 (8%) were receiving enteral tube feeds. Participants transitioned to OP5 from multiple daily injections (54%), prior Omnipod generation (31%), or another AID system (15%). CGM time in range (70-180 mg/dL) increased from 54% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 45.0, 63.0) to 64% (95% CI: 57, 71.8, <i>P</i> < 0.001) during the first 90 days and to 62.7% (95% CI: 54.9, 70.5, <i>P</i> < 0.001) during 91-180 days. Time above range (TAR) 181-250 mg/dL and TAR >250 mg/dL improved at 1-90 days and 91-180 days compared with baseline (<i>P</i> = 0.001 and <i>P</i> = 0.002, respectively). There were no significant changes in time below range (54-69 mg/dL, <54 mg/dL) or coefficient of variation. Two individuals discontinued OP5 within 14 days due to persistent hypoglycemia. One adult experienced a hypoglycemic seizure after 3 months of use. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> Use of the OP5 system in youth and adults with CFRD led to significant improvements in multiples measures of hyperglycemia without a change in CGM-measured hypoglycemia over a 6-month period, although patient experience with hypoglycemia may limit sustained use. Given the unique comorbidities and pathophysiology of CFRD, these results emphasize the need for future studies to investigate the safety and efficacy of AID devices in this patient population."

    "abstract": "The tear film is a complex structure with rich interactions with the human body. A growing body of evidence suggests that measuring changes in protein, lipid, or other metabolite concentration in the tear film can be used to help detect disease. Particularly in the era of precision medicine, the tear film serves as a promising source of non-invasive insights into systemic health for early diagnosis and treatment. This paper analyzes the latest research in tear film biomarkers for systemic diseases. The review was conducted through PubMed and Embase databases using the PRISMA protocol and includes 54 articles. This paper first reviews the anatomy and physiology of tear film, as well as the latest proteomic analysis techniques on the tear film. We then provide a disease-by-disease review on the tear film as a biomarker including 5 articles related to Alzheimer's Disease, 10 articles related to Cancers, 1 article related to Cystic Fibrosis, 1 article related to Migraines, 4 articles related to Multiple Sclerosis, 15 articles related to Parkinson's Disease, 7 articles related to Rheumatoid Arthritis, and 11 articles related to Thyroid Disease. This paper highlights the promising results of these studies yet also reviews the challenges with limited sample sizes, reproducibility, and biological understanding of biomarkers. We conclude this paper with insights for future work to ensure clinical validity and generalizability. Ultimately, the tear film is a clinically accessible, complex structure that provides a wealth of information that may contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of systemic health."

    "title": "Antimicrobial Agent Trimethoprim Influences Chemical Interactions in Cystic Fibrosis Pathogens via the <i>ham</i> Gene Cluster.",
    "abstract": "The fungus <i>Aspergillus fumigatus</i> and the bacterium <i>Burkholderia cenocepacia</i> cause fatal respiratory infections in immunocompromised humans and patients with lung disease, such as cystic fibrosis (CF). In dual infections, antagonistic interactions contribute to increased mortality. These interactions are further altered by the presence of antimicrobial and antifungal agents. However, studies performed to date on chemical interactions between clinical <i>B. cenocepacia</i> and <i>A. fumigatus</i> have focused on pathogens in isolation and do not include the most abundant chemical signal, i.e., clinically administered therapeutics, present in the lung. Here, we characterize small molecule-mediated interactions between <i>B. cenocepacia</i> and <i>A. fumigatus</i> and their shift in response to trimethoprim exposure by using metabolomics and mass spectrometry imaging. Using these methods, we report that the production of several small-molecule natural products of both the bacteria and the fungus is affected by cocultivation and exposure to trimethoprim. By systematic analysis of metabolomics data, we hypothesize that the <i>B. cenocepacia</i>-encoded <i>ham</i> gene cluster plays a role in the trimethoprim-mediated alteration of bacterial-fungal interactions. We support our findings by generating a genetically modified strain lacking the <i>ham</i> gene cluster and querying its interaction with <i>A. fumigatus</i>. Using comparative analyses of the extracts of wild-type and knockout strains, we report the inactivation of a bacterially produced antifungal compound, fragin, by <i>A. fumigatus</i>, which was verified by the addition of purified fragin to the <i>A. fumigatus</i> culture. Furthermore, we report that trimethoprim does not inhibit fungal growth, but affects the biochemical pathway for DHN-melanin biosynthesis, an important antifungal drug target, altering the pigmentation of the fungal conidia and is associated with modification of ergosterol to ergosteryl-3β-O-l-valine in coculture. This study demonstrates the impact of therapeutics on shaping microbial and fungal metabolomes, which influence interkingdom interactions and the expression of virulence factors. Our findings enhance the understanding of the complexity of chemical interactions between therapeutic compounds, bacteria, and fungi and may contribute to the development of selective treatments."

    "abstract": "FEV<sub>1</sub> and its longitudinal change are mortality risk-factors. Visit-to-visit-FEV<sub>1</sub>-variation is a risk-factor for death in cystic fibrosis but has not been studied in other cohorts. Assess if longitudinal visit-to-visit-FEV<sub>1</sub>-variation is a mortality risk-factor in World Trade Center (WTC) exposed FDNY rescue/recovery workers. Linear mixed-effects regression of all post-9/11/2001 FEV<sub>1</sub> measurements defined time-effect on longitudinal-FEV<sub>1</sub>-decline (FEV<sub>1</sub>-slope) and its standard error (visit-to-visit-FEV<sub>1</sub>-variation). Cox proportional hazards and logistic models adjusted for age and smoking assessed the association between FEV<sub>1</sub> related risk-factors and mortality. Receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (ROC-AUC) assessed predictive model performance. Among 11,745 workers with ≥3 FEV<sub>1</sub> measurements, 575 (4.9%) died. When all FEV<sub>1</sub>-related risk-factors were combined, each 5 mL/year increase in visit-to-visit-FEV<sub>1</sub>-variation increased mortality 2.1-fold (HR=2.14; 95%CI=1.84-2.48); each 10%predicted reduction in the last-longitudinal-FEV<sub>1</sub> increased mortality 15% (HR=1.15; 95%CI=1.09-1.21), but each 10ml/year longitudinal-FEV<sub>1</sub>-decline was not associated with mortality (HR=1.04; 95%CI=0.99-1.10). The ROC-AUC of a fully adjusted multivariable cumulative mortality model was 0.82 (95%CI=0.80-0.84); for unadjusted visit-to-visit-FEV<sub>1</sub>-variation, AUC was 0.80 (95%CI=0.78-0.82); for last-longitudinal-FEV<sub>1</sub> AUC was 0.61 (95%CI=0.59-0.64) and for longitudinal-FEV<sub>1</sub>-decline AUC was 0.58 (95%CI=0.56-0.61). In the 1,988/11,745(16.9%) with high-WTC-exposure defined as arrival at the WTC-site before noon on 9/11/2001, the risk of high-visit-to-visit-FEV<sub>1</sub>-variation (top-quartile, ≥10.35 ml/year) increased 25% (OR=1.25; 95%CI=1.12-1.40). Visit-to-visit-FEV<sub>1</sub>-variation is a mortality risk-factor in FDNY rescue and recovery workers with greater accuracy for predicting cumulative mortality than either last-longitudinal-FEV<sub>1</sub> or longitudinal-FEV<sub>1</sub>-decline. Further investigation in other cohorts is needed to assess the generalizability of this rarely studied mortality risk-factor."

    "abstract": "Cervical mucus changes throughout the menstrual cycle in response to hormonal fluctuations, regulating access of sperm and pathogens to the reproductive tract. CFTR is an anion channel that plays a critical role in mediating epithelial mucus secretions. Primary endocervical cells obtained from rhesus macaques Macaca mulatta were cultured using conditional reprogramming and treated with vehicle controls or CFTR inhibitors. In order to measure changes in hydration and viscosity of secreted mucus, we adapted two airway mucus assays, airway surface liquid and particle-tracking microrheology, for our endocervical culture system. Endocervical cells treated with CFTR inhibitors demonstrated dehydrated, thicker mucus secretions compared to controls in both assay outputs. Our studies suggest that CFTR may be an important mediator of fertility changes and provide experimental evidence for the infertility phenotype seen in women with cystic fibrosis. Additionally, assays developed in these studies provide new endpoints for assessing cervical mucus changes in vitro."

    "abstract": "Cholera is a severe infectious disease caused by the Gram-negative bacterium <i>Vibrio cholerae</i> after colonization in the intestinal tract. Cholera toxin (CT), a key exotoxin protein, primarily causes acute secretory diarrhea and life-threatening complications in infected patients. Traditional approaches remain insufficient for effectively treating cholera, underscoring the need for innovative countermeasures to eliminate CT-caused symptoms. Here, we report a glycan-modified cellular nanosponge for the enhanced treatment of CT-induced secretory diarrhea. Specifically, intestinal epithelial cell membrane-camouflaged nanosponges are functionalized with a glycan receptor to promote their capability for CT neutralization, thereby competitively inhibiting CT entry into host cells. Moreover, an inhibitor is encapsulated into the cellular nanosponge to synergistically improve the therapeutic effect of diarrhea by blocking the excessive chloride ion efflux from the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (a crucial anion channel) on the membrane of CT-intoxicated epithelial cells. Upon oral administration, the biomimetic nanomedicine effectively eliminates CT-induced secretory diarrhea and intestinal injuries in mice. Overall, this study highlights the potential of glycan-modified cellular nanosponges as promising and broad-spectrum therapeutic agents against secretory diarrhea caused by bacterial exotoxins."

    "abstract": "Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is an important, life-limiting co-morbidity in cystic fibrosis (CF), where multiple mechanisms such as hypoxia, inflammation and primary CF-transmembrane regulator (CFTR) dysfunction may affect vascular integrity. We aimed to characterize the structural impact of vascular wall changes in the pulmonary microcirculation, to uncover the potential need for therapeutic strategies targeting vascular disease. End-stage inflated CF (n=6), and control (n=4) lungs were processed to lung cores (2.8cm³) and scanned with micro-computed tomography (resolution: 8.5µm). The diameter and number of distal pulmonary arteries (dPA), distal airways (DA) and open terminal bronchioles (TB) were measured on 3D models (n= 2 cores/lobe) and compared per generation and within pairs. Morphometric assessment was paired with histological analysis (n= 1/lobe) to assess tissue morphology, collagen and connective tissue components. dPA in CF were narrowed and disappeared in the last generations of dichotomous branching, resulting in a decreased total diameter per generation. While narrowing was already present where TB remained open, dPA disappearance was only present where no TB were left. dPA narrowing increased when DA collapsed. Histologically, fibrotic dPA changes were present in areas without distal airway disease. We showed for the first time the presence of dPA lumen narrowing and disappearance with fibrotic vascular wall changes in end-stage CF. Narrowing was present diffusely and fibrosis was also present in areas without airway disease. These findings suggest that vascular dysfunction in CF may not solely be secondary to hypoxic vasoconstriction and inflammation but may represent a distinct pathophysiological process related to CFTR dysfunction in the endothelium, warranting further study."

Inhaled antibiotics, such as tobramycin, have been explored for their efficacy in managing these infections, but their efficacy and safety in NCFB remains uncertain. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to assess the efficacy and safety of inhaled tobramycin in NCFB patients. PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and ISI Web of Science databases were searched up to June 2024 using predefined keywords. Studies comparing inhaled tobramycin versus placebo were included if they reported outcomes related to P. aeruginosa eradication, sputum density, exacerbations, hospital admissions, and adverse events. Nine RCTs involving 772 patients met the inclusion criteria. Inhaled tobramycin significantly increased P. aeruginosa eradication rates compared to placebo (I<sup>2</sup> = 22.0 %, P = 0.255; RR 2.422, 95 % CI 1.570 to 3.738, P < 0.001).

    "title": "Antibiofilm properties of 4-hydroxy-3-methyl-2-alkenylquinoline, a novel <i>Burkholderia</i>-derived alkaloid.",
    "abstract": "Biofilms are an important colonization mechanism employed by several microbial species to better establish themselves and monopolize the acquisition of resources across different environs. Some bacteria have evolved specialized metabolites that, when secreted, disrupt the formation and stability of biofilms generated by competing heterospecies, providing the producing organism with an ecological advantage. Soil-derived species are probable candidates for the identification of such compounds, given the intense level of competition that occurs within the terrestrial ecosystem. The MS14 strain of <i>Burkholderia contaminans</i> isolated from soil in Mississippi has previously been shown to produce antimicrobial compounds like occidiofungin and ornibactin. In this report, we demonstrate that this strain also produces 4-hydroxy-3-methyl-2-alkenylquinoline (HMAQ-7), an alkaloid-based metabolite structurally similar to others produced by <i>Burkholderia</i>. HMAQ-7 was isolated and purified in sufficient quantities to enable the elucidation of its covalent structure and the evaluation of its biological effects. The compound was found to possess a unique ability to inhibit biofilm biosynthesis in several species, including opportunistic pathogens like <i>Staphylococcus haemolyticus</i> and within saliva-derived multispecies biofilms. HMAQ-7 also demonstrated an ability to modulate additional cellular behaviors in <i>Bacillus subtilis,</i> including motility and sporulation, suggesting that this molecule is important to the interspecies dynamics present across many diverse microenvironments.IMPORTANCEThe present study furthers our understanding of the structural complexity and the biological functions of the 2-alkyl-4(1H)-quinolone metabolites produced by <i>Burkholderia</i> spp. Low micromolar concentrations of HMAQ-7' induced observable bacterial growth morphology differences. The antibiofilm properties of the HMAQ-7' characterized in this study will promote future investigations into possible biological and applied roles. The ability to alter biofilm formation using HMAQ-7' may facilitate <i>Burkholderia</i> spp. colonization in a multitude of environments, that is, aquatic, soil, and possibly during infection. HMAQ may subvert competition by potential competitor species in natural environments of <i>Burkholderia</i> spp. and possibly lung infections of cystic fibrosis patients."

    "title": "Increased delay to lung transplantation for women candidates: gender-based disparity matters in the lung transplant trajectory.",
    "abstract": "Lung transplantation is a highly dynamic segment of solid organ transplantation in which gender plays a central role. Our objective was to investigate the causes of outcome differences between women and men all along the lung transplantation pathway. We used data from the French COhort in Lung Transplantation (COLT) study (12 participating lung transplantation centres). Analyses were performed in three phases: baseline clinical characteristics, peri-transplantation period and post-transplantation follow-up. Overall, 1710 participants (802 women and 908 men) were included in this study. Women were less likely than men to undergo transplantation (91.6% <i>versus</i> 95.6%; p=0.001) and waited longer before transplantation (115 <i>versus</i> 73 days; p<0.001). Female gender and pre-transplantation class I anti-human leukocyte antigen antibodies were identified as independent factors associated with longer waiting time duration. Female transplant recipients commonly received lungs from height- and sex-matched donors, despite higher female waiting list mortality and a higher proportion of male donors. Importantly, women with oversized lung transplantation (defined by predicted total lung capacity (pTLC) ratio and weight mismatch) did not have worse survival. The overall post-transplantation survival of female recipients was significantly higher than that of male recipients (65.6% <i>versus</i> 57.3%; p<0.001), although the prevalence of specific major lung transplantation outcomes did not differ according to gender. Women waited longer and were less likely to undergo transplantation. Women transplanted with an oversized lung did not have worse survival after transplantation, suggesting that size matching criteria based on pTLC ratio and weight mismatch may be less stringent in this context."

    "title": "Efficacy of Trikafta (ELX/TEZ/IVA) & Symdeko (TEZ/IVA) in Treating Cystic Fibrosis with F508del Allele: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.",
    "abstract": "The objective of the study was to assess and compare the efficacy of elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ELX/TEZ/IVA) treatment with TEZ/IVA treatment in individuals diagnosed with cystic fibrosis (CF) and carrying the F508del allele. An extensive search of relevant literature was conducted using online resources, namely, PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar. The initial search identified 248 articles, and after a careful examination of the full text of 18 articles, 7 met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. These selected reports were then thoroughly examined to perform a comparative analysis of the effectiveness of TEZ/IVA versus ELX/TEZ/IVA in CF patients with the F508del allele. The quality of the selected reports was evaluated using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized studies, known as RoB 2. ELX/TEZ/IVA has shown significant improvements in key indicators of CF treatment. It has demonstrated a significant increase in forced expiratory volume in one second levels, indicating improved respiratory capacity and airflow. Additionally, ELX/TEZ/IVA successfully reduced sweat chloride levels and positively impacted Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised Respiratory Domain scores, reflecting enhanced respiratory function and improved quality of life for patients. Overall, the study concluded that ELX/TEZ/IVA provided a clinically robust benefit compared to TEZ/IVA alone while maintaining a favourable safety profile."

    "abstract": "Chronic care manages long-term, progressive conditions, while acute care addresses short-term conditions. Chronic conditions increasingly strain health systems, which are often unprepared for these demands. This study examines the burden of conditions requiring acute versus chronic care, including sequelae. Conditions and sequelae from the Global Burden of Diseases Study 2019 were classified into acute or chronic care categories. Data were analysed by age, sex, and socio-demographic index, presenting total numbers and contributions to burden metrics such as Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs), Years Lived with Disability (YLD), and Years of Life Lost (YLL). Approximately 68% of DALYs were attributed to chronic care, while 27% were due to acute care. Chronic care needs increased with age, representing 86% of YLDs and 71% of YLLs, and accounting for 93% of YLDs from sequelae. These findings highlight that chronic care needs far exceed acute care needs globally, necessitating health systems to adapt accordingly."

    "title": "Dual-functional silver-based metal-organic frameworks facilitate electrochemical/electrochemiluminescent dual-channel detection of chloride ions and glutathione.",
    "abstract": "The early diagnosis of diseases largely relies on the monitoring and accurate detection of biomarkers within biological systems. The quantification of chloride ions (Cl<sup>-</sup>) and glutathione (GSH) can effectively assess the progression of diseases such as cystic fibrosis and cancer, as well as the alterations in the body's internal environment. However, developing reliable sensing platforms with high sensitivity and selectivity poses significant challenges. Based on the dual-functional silver-based metal-organic frameworks (Ag MOF), an electrochemical/electrochemiluminescent (EC/ECL) dual-channel nanoplatform was developed for the detection of Cl<sup>-</sup> and GSH, aided by graphitic carbon nitride (g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>). In the EC mode, the interaction between Ag MOF and Cl<sup>-</sup> leads to the formation of silver chloride (AgCl), which is characterized by an increased peak current of AgCl solid-state electrochemistry as Cl<sup>-</sup> concentration rises. The further introduction of GSH generates a non-electroactive complex through competition with Cl<sup>-</sup>, resulting in a decrease in the peak current of AgCl. In the ECL mode, the quenching of ECL signals from g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> by Ag MOF is alleviated by Cl<sup>-</sup>, due to the etching of the Ag-MOF. The ECL recovery effect is further enhanced with the addition of GSH. For Cl<sup>-</sup>, both EC and ECL responses exhibit good linear relationships with concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 10 mM, with detection limit (LOD) of 0.4 mM and 0.1 mM, respectively. For GSH, EC and ECL also show good linear relationships in range of 0.01-100 μM, with LOD of 9.8 nM and 1.02 nM. The unique properties of Ag MOF, acting both as an electrochemical sensing component that generates sensitive current outputs for Cl<sup>-</sup> and GSH, and as a quencher for the ECL of g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>, facilitate the sequential detection of Cl<sup>-</sup> and GSH, providing mutual validation that significantly enhances accuracy and reliability. The specific interactions of Ag MOF with these analytes offer the innovative platform good selectivity, demonstrating significant potential for advancements in biological analysis and disease diagnosis."

    "abstract": "Arsenic is associated with lung disease and experimental models suggest that arsenic-induced degradation of the chloride channel CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) is a mechanism of arsenic toxicity. We examined associations between arsenic exposure, sweat chloride concentration (measure of CFTR function), and pulmonary function among 269 adults in Bangladesh. Participants with sweat chloride ≥ 60 mmol/L had higher arsenic exposures than those with sweat chloride < 60 mmol/L (water: median 77.5 µg/L versus 34.0 µg/L, p = 0.025; toenails: median 4.8 µg/g versus 3.7 µg/g, p = 0.024). In linear regression models, a one-unit µg/g increment in toenail arsenic was associated with a 0.59 mmol/L higher sweat chloride concentration, p < 0.001. Among the entire study population, after adjusting for covariates including age, sex, smoking, education, and height, toenail arsenic concentration was associated with increased odds of airway obstruction (OR: 1.97, 95%: 1.06, 3.67, p = 0.03); however, sweat chloride concentration did not mediate this association. Our findings suggest that sweat chloride concentration may serve as novel biomarker for arsenic exposure, warranting further investigation in diverse populations, and that arsenic likely acts on the lung through mechanisms other than inducing CFTR dysfunction. Alternative mechanisms by which environmental arsenic exposure may lead to obstructive lung disease, such as arsenic-induced direct lung injury and/or increase lung proteinase activity, require additional exploration in future work."

    "abstract": "This study analyzed eleven isolates of colistin-resistant <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, originating from Portugal and Taiwan, which are associated with various pathologies. The results revealed significant genetic diversity among the isolates, with each exhibiting a distinct genetic profile. A prevalence of sequence type ST235 was observed, characterizing it as a high-risk clone, and serotyping indicated a predominance of type O11, associated with chronic respiratory infections in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. The phylogenetic analysis demonstrated genetic diversity among the isolates, with distinct clades and complex evolutionary relationships. Additionally, transposable elements such as Tn3 and IS6 were identified in all isolates, highlighting their importance in the mobility of antibiotic resistance genes. An analysis of antimicrobial resistance profiles revealed pan-drug resistance in all isolates, with a high prevalence of genes conferring resistance to β-lactams and aminoglycosides. Furthermore, additional analyses revealed mutations in regulatory networks and specific loci previously implicated in colistin resistance, such as <i>pmrA</i>, <i>cprS</i>, <i>phoO</i>, and others, suggesting a possible contribution to the observed resistant phenotype. This study has a strong impact because it not only reveals the genetic diversity and resistance mechanisms in <i>P. aeruginosa</i> but also identifies mutations in regulatory genes associated with colistin resistance."

For the <i>cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator</i> (<i>CFTR</i>) gene, tissue-specific expression, especially in the pancreas, remains poorly understood. Unraveling its regulation could clarify the clinical heterogeneity observed in cystic fibrosis and CFTR-related disorders. To understand the role of 3D chromatin architecture in establishing tissue-specific expression of the <i>CFTR</i> gene, we mapped chromatin interactions and epigenomic regulation in Capan-1 pancreatic cells. Candidate CREs are validated by luciferase reporter assay and CRISPR knock-out. We identified active CREs not only around the <i>CFTR</i> gene but also outside the topologically associating domain (TAD). We demonstrate the involvement of multiple CREs upstream and downstream of the <i>CFTR</i> gene and reveal a cooperative effect of the -44 kb, -35 kb, +15.6 kb, and +37.7 kb regions, which share common predicted transcription factor (TF) motifs. We also extend our analysis to compare 3D chromatin conformation in intestinal and pancreatic cells, providing valuable insights into the tissue specificity of CREs in regulating <i>CFTR</i> gene expression."

    "abstract": "Mammalian spermatozoa undergo a series of physiological and biochemical changes in the oviduct that lead them to acquire the ability to fertilize eggs. During their transit in the oviduct, spermatozoa face a series of environmental changes that can affect sperm viability. A series of ion channels and transporters, as well as the sperm cytoskeleton, allow spermatozoa to remain viable and functional. Cl<sup>-</sup> channels such as TMEM16A (calcium-activated chloride channel), CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator), and ClC3 (chloride voltage-gated channel 3) are some of the ion transporters involved in maintaining cellular homeostasis. They are expressed in mammalian spermatozoa and are associated with capacitation, acrosomal reaction, and motility. However, little is known about their role in maintaining sperm volume. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the mechanism through which TMEM16A maintains sperm volume during capacitation. The effects of TMEM16A were compared to those of CFTR and ClC3. Spermatozoa were capacitated in the presence of specific TMEM16A, CFTR, and ClC3 inhibitors, and the results showed that only TMEM16A inhibition increased acrosomal volume, leading to changes within the acrosome. Similarly, only TMEM16A inhibition prevented actin polymerization during capacitation. Further analysis showed that TMEM16A inhibition also prevented ERK1/2 and RhoA activation. On the other hand, TMEM16A and CFTR inhibition affected both capacitation and spontaneous acrosomal reaction, whereas ClC3 inhibition only affected the spontaneous acrosomal reaction. In conclusion, during capacitation, TMEM16A activity regulates acrosomal structure through actin polymerization and by regulating ERK1/2 and RhoA activities."

    "abstract": "In patients with cystic fibrosis (pwCF) acid suppression therapy, gastrointestinal dysmotility, and post-operative bowel status, may predispose to the development of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). SIBO may continue to be present in the progression of the disease even on modulators. Breath testing is the most simple, non-invasive and available method for diagnosing SIBO. There are some divergencies over the operational procedures used to carry out and interpret breath tests in pwCF. We performed a systematic review of SIBO in pwCF to assess the methods used in breath tests and the existence of causal relationship between SIBO and following CF co-morbidities: liver disease, fat absorption, and eating disorders. We searched the PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, LILACS, MEDLINE, OpenGray, medRxiv, Google Scholar, and CAPES databases up to March 20, 2024. We selected clinical cohort and case-control studies to assess SIBO in cwCF. We selected studies that met the following criteria: (1) participants - children and adolescents diagnosed with CF; (2) intervention - assessment of SIBO using H2 and CH4 breath tests; (3) control - patients without SIBO; and (4) outcome - assessment of breath tests for SIBO diagnosis and the causal relationship between SIBO and CF co-morbidities. The PRISMA statement was used to report the search. QUADAS 2 tool was used for assessing the quality of each study methodology. The protocol for this review was registered in the Prospective Registration of Systematic Review Database (CRD42024503593). The search strategy identified 279 studies. After screening titles and abstracts, 36 studies were selected for full-text review and 27 were excluded; nine studies involving 206 pwCFs were reviewed. All nine studies used H2 breath tests as a diagnostic method for SIBO, and five of them used a combined H2/CH4 test. There was no consistency in the timing of cessation of antibiotic therapy prior to testing. All patients performed the test after an overnight fast. A basal sample was collected prior to substrate (glucose or lactulose) ingestion, which ranged from 7 to 20 ppm. There was great variability between respiratory sample collection times, being times 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 minutes the most used protocol. The methods for performing breath tests varied widely, making it difficult to reach conclusions on the role of SIBO as a co-morbidity in pwCF. There was no association between increased serum AST, ALT, and GGT levels and positive breath tests. There was no agreement regarding the role of SIBO and nutritional deficiency, but a reduction in fat absorption and the presence of hyporexia have been described under this condition. Data on assessment of SIBO in pwCF is limited by the small number of studies available, the lack of appropriate controls in some studies, and the varying test methodology and diagnostic cut-offs applied. Protocols to investigate and diagnosing SIBO in pwCF need to be developed."

    "title": "p.Phe508del-CFTR Trafficking: A Protein Quality Control Perspective Through UPR, UPS, and Autophagy.",
    "abstract": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease due to mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (<i>CFTR</i>) gene. The most frequent mutation (p.Phe508del) results in a misfolded protein (p.Phe508del-CFTR) with an altered transport to the membrane of the cells via the conventional protein secretion (CPS) pathway. Nevertheless, it can use unconventional protein secretion (UPS). Indeed, p.Phe508del-CFTR forms a complex with GRASP55 to assist its direct trafficking from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane. While GRASP55 is a key player of UPS, it is also a key player of stress-induced autophagy. In parallel, the unfolded protein response (UPR), which is activated in the presence of misfolded proteins, is tightly linked to UPS and autophagy through the key effectors IRE1, PERK, and ATF6. A better understanding of how UPS, UPR, and stress-induced autophagy interact to manage protein trafficking in CF and other conditions could lead to novel therapeutic strategies. By enhancing or modulating these pathways, it may be possible to increase p.Phe508del-CFTR surface expression. In summary, this review highlights the critical roles of UPS- and UPR-induced autophagy in managing protein transport, offering new perspectives for therapeutic approaches."

    "abstract": "Lumacaftor, the corrector of Orkambi, enhances the processing of F508del cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), but its impact on the channel activity of rescued F508del CFTR (rF508del) is unclear. Using an electrode-based, real-time iodide efflux assay performed at room temperature, acute exposure to lumacaftor was shown to increase the processing of F508del CFTR without a proportional increase in channel activity in a CFBE41o-cell line stably expressing F508del CFTR (CFBE-DF). A similar effect was not observed on wild-type CFTR in a HEK293 cell line. At 37°C, rF508del channel activity is significantly inhibited in CFBE-DF cells by acute exposure to 5 µM lumacaftor, but not to 5 µM tezacaftor or 1 µM elexacaftor, the two correctors of Trikafta. Lumacaftor's inhibitory effect was characterized by a major left shift of the peak channel activity relative to the peak CFTR processing in the dose-response chart, which is absent for tezacaftor or elexacaftor. Ussing chamber analysis on polarized CFBE-DF cells reveals an inhibitory effect for lumacaftor on the forskolin- and ivacaftor-induced change in short-circuit current. Single channel patch clamp on HEK-DF cells shows that acute application of cytosolic lumacaftor significantly decreases rF508del channel open probability. Taken together, despite its strong corrector activity, lumacaftor inhibits rF508del channel activity, compromising the degree of functional rescue. This effect may contribute to the limited clinical efficacy of Orkambi.<b>NEW & NOTEWORTHY</b> Small-molecule correctors bind to F508del cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and restore its trafficking to the plasma membrane to function as an anion channel. Despite its high efficacy as a corrector, lumacaftor inhibits the channel opening of rescued F508del CFTR, making it a weak CFTR modulator. The current work highlights the impact of CFTR correctors on the channel activity of rescued F508del CFTR as an important variable in the efficacy of modulator therapy."

    "abstract": "Ensifentrine, recently approved by the FDA for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) maintenance treatment, is a novel inhaled therapy with a dual mechanism of action targeting phosphodiesterase (PDE)3 and PDE4. While long-acting bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids remain initial guideline-based COPD treatments, persistent symptoms and disease exacerbations highlight an existing unmet need. Ensifentrine offers both bronchodilator and anti-inflammatory benefits, offering the potential to address this treatment gap. This article reviews the mechanism of action of ensifentrine, details supporting preclinical evidence, and summarizes key clinical studies. It further explores ensifentrine's potential impact on the COPD treatment landscape and its potential applicability in other pulmonary diseases. Ensifentrine's dual bronchodilator and anti-inflammatory action offer a promising adjunct to standard COPD treatments, particularly for patients with persistent symptoms despite conventional therapy. It improves lung function, meaningfully reduces exacerbation frequency, reduces symptoms, and enhances quality of life. Its inhaled delivery minimizes systemic exposure and side effects commonly observed with oral PDE inhibitors. Furthermore, its anti-inflammatory properties suggest potential applications in other chronic respiratory diseases, such as asthma and non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis."

With a deeper understanding of its immune regulation and mechanisms of action, these findings have increasingly highlighted their guiding value in clinical practice. The gut is not only the largest digestive organ in the human body but also the habitat for most microorganisms. Imbalances in gut microbial communities have been associated with various lung diseases, such as allergic asthma and cystic fibrosis. Furthermore, gut microbial communities have significant impacts on metabolic function and immune responses. Their metabolites not only regulate gastrointestinal immune systems but may also affect distant organs such as the lungs and brain. As one of the most common types of respiratory system diseases worldwide, pulmonary infections have high morbidity and mortality rates. Pulmonary infections caused by immune dysfunction can lead to gastrointestinal problems like diarrhea, further resulting in imbalances within complex interactions that are associated with abnormal manifestations under disequilibrium conditions. Meanwhile, clinical interventions can significantly modulate the composition of gut microbiota, and alteration in gut microbiota may subsequently indicate susceptibility to pulmonary infections and even contribute to the prevention or regulation of their progression. This review delves into the interaction between gut microbiota and pulmonary infections, elucidating the latest advancements in gut-lung axis research and providing a fresh perspective for the treatment and prevention of pneumonia."

The correlation between these proteomics approaches has not yet been studied among individuals with a Fontan circulation. The correlation of plasma protein measurements between SomaScan and Olink platforms was evaluated in adults with a Fontan circulation. We measured 491 proteins in plasma of 71 adults with a Fontan circulation using Olink and SomaScan. Missing Olink measurements (0.13%, 47/34,861) were imputed using non-parametric imputation. Spearman's rank correlation coefficient for absolute values of protein expression between platforms was calculated. Protein correlation frequencies were compared to 3 cohorts reported in the literature using Pearson's Chi-squared test of independence. Overall, protein correlations between Olink and SomaScan measurements were moderately strong for most proteins, (rho > 0.4 for 57.2%), but with substantial variability (median correlation = 0.457, IQR = 0.538). The distribution of protein correlations was qualitatively similar to published literature in non-Fontan cohorts. Both Olink and SomaScan identified proteins with sex-based differences; both identified differences in myostatin and leptin, but each identified additional nonoverlapping sexually dimorphic proteins (n = 14 Olink, n = 5 SomaScan). In adults with a Fontan circulation, correlations between plasma proteins measured by Olink and SomaScan varied widely, approximately in line with prior reports in other populations. While these tools may be uniquely useful to generate hypotheses, specifically regarding potential molecular mechanisms, more definitive inference requires independent validation."

However, the steep cost of targeted therapy poses significant financial burden for individuals and health systems. We aimed to determine the trends in Medicare and Medicaid spending on CFTR modulators between the years 2015 and 2022 through retrospective analysis of the Medicare and Medicaid claims data. The outcome measures included total dosage units prescribed, number of claims, spending per claim, and total spending on CFTR modulators for Medicare and Medicaid between 2015 to 2022. Average annual percentage changes (AAPC) were calculated for all outcome measures. Our results show that from 2015 to 2022, Medicaid consistently had higher total dosage units prescribed, number of claims, spending per claim, and overall spending on CFTR modulators compared to Medicare. Total spending for both Medicaid [AAPC 38.9, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 27.2-51.6, p < 0.01] and Medicare [AAPC 39.2, 95 % CI 30.2-55.1, p < 0.01] increased significantly during this period. Increases in CFTR spending was accelerated beginning in 2019, when the triple combination CFTR modulator therapy, elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor, was introduced to the US market. This increase has been accompanied by a reduction in spending and use of other CFTR agents. This study evaluated the increases in spending for CFTR modulators over the years and the main drivers behind them, which may help inform future negotiations between healthcare systems and pharmaceutical companies, as well as policy makers and stakeholders."

An effective and accessible emotion regulation-focused intervention is needed. To compare the efficacy of online dialectical behavioral therapy for chronic pain plus treatment as usual (iDBT-Pain) with only treatment as usual on emotion dysregulation in people with chronic pain. This 2-arm randomized clinical trial was conducted from March 2023 to September 2024 in Australia. Participants were adults with chronic pain (lasting ≥3 months) and weekly pain intensity of 3 or higher out of 10 (10 indicating worst pain), without psychotic or personality disorders, and without dementia. Eligible participants were randomly assigned (1:1 ratio) to receive either iDBT-Pain for 9 weeks or treatment as usual only. Intention-to-treat data analyses were performed between August and September 2024. The iDBT-Pain group received 8 group-based 90-minute therapist-guided online sessions as well as an app and a handbook for self-learning. Content focused on DBT skills training, including pain science education. Participants in the treatment-as-usual group continued usual care, which consisted of treatment options that can be accessed in the community. The primary outcome was emotion dysregulation at 9 weeks after randomization. The Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (score range: 18-90, with higher scores indicating higher emotion dysregulation) was used in assessment. Among 89 participants (mean [SD] age, 51.5 [14.2] years; 74 females [83%]), 44 (49%) were randomly assigned to the treatment-as-usual group and 45 (51%) were randomly assigned to the iDBT-Pain group. Overall, 79 participants (89%) completed the 9-week assessment. Between-group difference in emotion dysregulation over time favored iDBT-Pain over treatment as usual at 9 weeks (-4.88; 95% CI, -9.20 to -0.55; P = .03; Cohen d = -0.46 [95% CI, -0.87 to -0.08]).

    "abstract": "There have been significant improvements in the health of infants and children with cystic fibrosis (CF) since universal newborn screening (NBS) was implemented in the United States (US). However, a significant proportion of infants with CF are not evaluated in a timely manner, and delays disproportionately affect children from minoritized racial/ethnic groups. The aim of this study was to understand experiences of NBS in caregivers of young children with CF in the United States. We recruited caregivers of children (0-13 years) with CF through listservs and social media of CF organizations. The survey was administered online in 2023 and included questions about their recollections of their child's NBS and the process of getting a CF diagnosis. Of 383 caregiver respondents, 43% reported being informed that their child's race or ethnicity was a predictor of the chances of their child having CF. Most reported that after they were notified of a positive NBS test, the initial evaluation for CF was scheduled ≥ 4 days later, 45% reported a delay of ≥ 8 days, and 5% reporting a delay of ≥ 15 days. Most (91%) felt the initial evaluation for CF was thorough, but 35% reported delays in getting information about their child's diagnosis. Caregivers report delays in evaluation after a positive NBS. A significant proportion reported delays in receiving information about their child's diagnosis or being told that race or ethnicity were related to risk of CF. These findings show the need for education and practice changes in both primary care and CF center settings."

    "title": "Sodium-Coupled Monocarboxylate Absorption in the Airway Epithelium Is Facilitated by the SLC5A8 Co-Transporter.",
    "abstract": "Amino acids, sugars, short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), vitamins, and other small molecules compose the extracellular metabolome on the airway lumen surface, but how the airway epithelium deals with these molecules has not been deeply studied. Due to the broad spectrum of metabolites transported by SLC5A8 and SLC5A12, we aim to determine if they are functionally expressed and participate in the absorption of Na<sup>+</sup>, short-chain fatty acids, and monocarboxylates in mouse and human airway epithelium. Tracheas isolated from male or female mice and human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) were used for electrophysiological studies in the Ussing chamber and to detect members of the SLC16 family by RT-PCR and bulk RNAseq. Additionally, cell lines expressing the human and murine SLC5A8 transporter were employed for uptake studies using a fluorescent lactate probe. We showed for the first time that human and murine airway epithelium express a functional SLC5A8 transporter, facilitating the absorption of glucose metabolites and SCFAs. The Na<sup>+</sup>-coupled monocarboxylate transport was not additive with ENaC-mediated Na<sup>+</sup> absorption in mouse trachea. We observed that valproate acts as an inhibitor of the murine but not of the human SLC5A8 transporter. Our results demonstrate that several metabolites derived from bacterial and cellular metabolism can be transported from the airway lumen into the epithelial cells, participating in a homeostatic relation of the tissue with its environment."

    "abstract": "Previous research showed that lung function abnormalities are common in infants with cystic fibrosis (IwCF) but real-world data are missing. This single-center retrospective study analyzed infant lung function results from IwCF born in 2012-2018. The tests were conducted at Great Ormond Street Hospital, London, as part of routine care at 3 months, 1 year, and 2 years of age. Z-scores for SF<sub>6</sub> Lung Clearance Index (zLCI), plethysmographic FRC (zFRC<sub>pleth</sub>) and FEV<sub>0.5</sub> were derived. Microbiology and antibiotics prescription from 3 months before lung function assessments, up to the closest medical review following the lung function encounter, were analyzed, along with changes in management advised by the physician. A total of 126 lung function encounters (n = 43 at 3 months, 46 at 1 year, 37 at 2 years) from 60 IwCF were included. LCI was abnormal (zLCI > 1.96) in 31% (12/39) of 3-month-olds (mean± zLCI 1.21 ± 1.08), 28% (12/43) of 1-year-olds and 19% (7/36) of 2-year-olds (mean± zLCI 1.13 ± 1.10). Among 74 cases with recent positive microbiology or abnormal chest findings at medical review, 100% (31/31) of those with abnormal lung function and 86% (37/43) of those with normal lung function (p = 0.04) had a recent antibiotic prescription or a change in clinical management. Conversely, in encounters with abnormal lung function but normal clinical findings, management changes occurred in only 12% (2/16) of cases. In this real-word cohort of IwCF, clinical management was mainly influenced by clinical findings and only marginally by abnormal lung function (elevated FRC or LCI)."

    "abstract": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a chronic genetic disorder requiring regimented visits for maintenance of care. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the accessibility of telehealth (TH) and forced a trial of incorporating remote care into routine CF care. The CF Learning Network (CFLN) organized for data sharing into a telehealth innovation lab (TH-iLab) to improve access to the interdisciplinary care team and co-produced shared agenda-setting. All persons with CF (PwCF) with a CF diagnosis in the CF Foundation Registry (CFFPR) from 1/2020-12/2021 were included and categorized into CFLN TH-iLab, CFLN TH-iLab non-participants, and non-CFLN programs. standardized TH implementation in the CFLN TH-iLab is associated with increased access to the CF care model and results in similar lung function and nutrition health outcomes. In 2020 and 2021, the average number of TH visits per person per year and the percentage of PwCF with one or more TH visits per year were higher in the CFLN TH-iLab than in the other groups. Lung function was highest in PwCF, followed by a program that was part of the CFLN TH-iLab in 2020 and 2021. Anthropometric measurements, spirometry, and attainment of microbiology cultures were similar among all three groups. Access to interdisciplinary care was highest in the CFLN non-TH-iLab group. Integrating TH into CF care in the CFLN TH-iLab provided access to care during the COVID-19 pandemic without compromising clinical outcomes. Further research on optimizing the telehealth experience for PwCF can help better understand TH's long-term impact on CF care."

Food insecurity (FI) poses a significant challenge for people with CF (pwCF), impacting their ability to maintain the necessary dietary intake. This study aims to explore FI and dietary patterns among pwCF in Turkey. A cross-sectional study involving 290 pwCF from the Marmara University Selim Çöremen Cystic Fibrosis Center was conducted between April 2023 and February 2024. The \"US Household Food Security Survey Module\" and the \"Your Current Life Situation\" survey were used to assess FI and socioeconomic status among the participants. Nutritional data, including BMI, FEV1 values, and dietary intake, were recorded. Among the participants, 52.7% were female, with a mean age of 13.3 ± 8.1 years. FI was detected in 46.8% of pwCF, with 18% facing very low food security. Higher income levels were associated with better food security (p = 0.008). Nutritional inadequacies were observed even among food-secure individuals, particularly in the consumption of legumes, nuts, and fish. BMI and BMI percentile values were significantly lower in the very low FS group compared to the high FS group (p = 0.03 and p = 0.02, respectively). Ensuring adequate nutrition and calorie intake is crucial for pwCF. Our study highlights significant FI among pwCF in Turkey, with income levels influencing food security status. Nutritional inadequacies persist even among those classified as food secure. Based on these findings, targeted nutritional support will be provided to those in need to improve overall health and well-being."

    "abstract": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common genetic diseases in the Caucasian population. CFTR defects, the most common being F508del, lead to abnormal mucus accumulation. Respiratory failure caused by the resulting chronic infections is the leading cause of death in people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF). Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a major pathogen in CF and is responsible for a deterioration of respiratory function in pwCF. The increase of antibiotic-resistant P. aeruginosa strains encourages the search for alternative therapeutics for treating P. aeruginosa infection. In vitro studies have shown an interest in (R)-roscovitine (roscovitine) in the fight against bacterial infection in pwCF. Here we show a nuanced effect of roscovitine on ASL bactericidal activity and CF bronchial epithelium protection against P. aeruginosa. Using a 3D model of fully differentiated and functional F508del-CFTR human bronchial epithelium, we evidenced (i) an enhancement of the bactericidal activity of the airway surface liquid for 25 μM roscovitine but (ii) no limitation of the dynamic of the epithelium destruction upon roscovitine treatment whatever the concentrations. Our findings shed light on reasons for the lack of beneficial effects to prevent P. aeruginosa infection in pwCF treated with roscovitine in the ROSCO-CF clinical trial. We anticipate that our findings would have significant therapeutic implications in seeking to optimize roscovitine analogs."

    "abstract": "Standard pre-clinical testing methods for novel antimicrobial therapeutics used to treat chronic lung infections in people with cystic fibrosis do not reflect the environmental conditions of the hostile lung niche. Current reductionist testing conditions can lead to the progression of compounds along a preclinical pipeline without evidence of their activity under cystic fibrosis lung niche-appropriate conditions. Several approaches used to study traditional antimicrobials may not be suitable for antibiotic alternatives, including anti-virulence therapeutics like anti-quorum sensing agents and siderophore inhibitors. This protocol documents an aggregate biofilm model of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to compare resistance and infection-relevant gene expression in single-species and multi-species cultures (Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans), examining colony-forming unit (CFU) reductions and changes in gene expression, using algD as an exemplar. The model was optimized for small, static volumes of bacterial cultures to allow the study of novel compounds in the discovery phase of the drug development pipeline, where compound quantities may be limited. Single-species P. aeruginosa biofilms were formed in Synthetic Cystic Fibrosis Medium 2 (SCFM2) for 24 h before treatment with meropenem at different concentrations (1, 16, and 256 µg/mL) for a further 24 h. Polymicrobial biofilms were established by growing Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans together in SCFM2, then inoculating with P. aeruginosa for an additional 24 h and treating with meropenem. The lack of a direct connection between compound efficacy measures in pre-clinical testing and clinical trial results has cast doubt on the applicability of current laboratory screening tools. This model allows us to understand the impact of relevant factors on P. aeruginosa gene expression, including genes contributing to resistance and virulence, thereby bridging this gap."

    "abstract": "The use of elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI) has been associated with increased fertility in women with cystic fibrosis (CF) and is increasingly used during pregnancy to support both maternal and fetal health. However, little is known about the pharmacokinetics (PK) of ETI during pregnancy, which is crucial for optimizing its efficacy and safety. This study aimed to predict the PK of ETI during pregnancy and to determine the maternal dose required to achieve therapeutic concentrations in both the maternal and fetus. The pregnancy physiological-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model within the Simcyp Simulator was used to predict the maternal and feto-placental exposure of ETI. Placental kinetics were parameterized using permeability parameters determined from the physicochemical properties of these compounds. The model closely predicted the observed data, with the observed ETI maternal plasma concentrations, cord concentrations, and infant plasma concentrations mostly falling within the range of predicted 5th to 95th percentiles. Steady-state simulations up to gestational week 40 predicted a continuous decline in ETI concentrations, with the AUC declining to 32.4-37.5% of baseline levels by week 40. However, the 5th percentile of trough concentrations for ETI consistently remained above the efficacy thresholds, both in mother and fetus. Therefore, it appears reasonable to maintain standard dosing regimen during pregnancy, complemented by careful monitoring. A clinical trial, such as the ongoing Maternal and Fetal Outcomes in the Era of Modulators (MAYFLOWERS) study, is required to further confirm the efficacy and safety of ETI in this population."

    "abstract": "Remote health monitoring has the potential to enable individuals to take control of their own health and well-being and to facilitate a transition toward preventative and personalized healthcare. Sweat can be sampled non-invasively and contains a wealth of information about the metabolic state of an individual, making it an excellent candidate for remote health monitoring. An accurate, rapid, and low-cost biofluid characterization technique is required to enable the widespread use of remote health monitoring. We previously introduced microfluidic impedance spectroscopy for the detection of electrolyte concentration in fluids, whereby a novel device architecture, measurement method, and analysis technique were presented for the characterization of cationic species. The purely electrical nature of this measurement technique removes the intermediate steps inherent in common rival technologies such as optical and electrochemical sensing, offering a range of advantages. In this work, we investigate the effect of temperature on microfluidic impedance spectroscopy of ionic species commonly present in biofluids. We find that the impedance spectra and concentration determination are temperature-dependent; remote health monitoring devices must be calibrated appropriately as they are likely to experience temperature fluctuations. Importantly, we demonstrate the ability of the method to measure the concentration of anionic species alongside that of cationic species, enabling the detection of chloride and lactate, which are useful biomarkers for hydration, cystic fibrosis, fatigue, sepsis, and hypoperfusion. We show that the presence of neutral species does not impair accurate determination of ionic concentration, thus, demonstrating the suitability of microfluidic impedance spectroscopy for non-invasive biofluid characterization."

    "abstract": "Despite medical science advancements in recent years, pulmonary diseases are still hard to control and can be potentially life-threatening. These include asthma, COPD, lung cancer, cystic fibrosis, pneumonia, pleurisy, and sarcoidosis. These illnesses often cause severe breathing problems, which can be fatal if not treated properly. While some chemical drugs are used to treat these conditions, they can cause side effects and are not always effective. Herbal medicine offers an alternative treatment option with fewer side effects and has shown promise in treating respiratory issues. Certain medicinal plants, such as garlic (Allium sativum), hawthorn (Crataegus rhipidophylla), moringa (Moringa oleifera), and ashwagandha (Withania somnifera), may help manage lung diseases. Natural compounds found in plants, like apple polyphenol, ligustrazine, salidroside, resveratrol, and quercetin, can also help reduce symptoms. These plants and compounds work by reducing cell overgrowth, fighting oxidative stress, lowering inflammation, stopping tumor growth, improving blood flow, and relaxing the airways. This review outlines the types of plants and compounds that can be utilized in treating pulmonary conditions, along with their respective mechanisms of action."

    "title": "Progress of personalized medicine of cystic fibrosis in the times of efficient CFTR modulators.",
    "abstract": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a systemic disorder of exocrine glands that is caused by mutations in the CFTR gene. The basic defect in people with CF (pwCF) leads to impaired epithelial transport of chloride and bicarbonate that can be assessed by CFTR biomarkers, i.e. the β-adrenergic sweat rate and sweat chloride concentration (SCC), chloride conductance of the nasal respiratory epithelium (NPD), urine secretion of bicarbonate, intestinal current measurements (ICM) of chloride secretory responses in rectal biopsies and in bioassays of chloride transport in organoids or cell cultures. CFTR modulators are a novel class of drugs that improve defective posttranslational processing, trafficking and function of mutant CFTR. By April 2025, triple combination therapy with the CFTR potentiator ivacaftor (IVA) and the CFTR correctors elexacaftor (ELX) and tezacaftor (TEZ) has been approved in Europe for the treatment of all pwCF who do not carry two minimal function CFTR mutations. Previous phase 3 and post-approval phase 4 studies in pwCF who harbour one or two alleles of the major mutation F508del consistently reported significant improvements of lung function and anthropometry upon initiation of ELX/TEZ/IVA compared to baseline. Normalization of SCC, NPD and ICM correlated with clinical outcomes on the population level, but the restoration of CFTR function was diverse and not predictive for clinical outcome in the individual patient. Theratyping of non-F508del CF genotypes in patient-derived organoids and cell cultures revealed for most cases clinically meaningful increases of CFTR activity upon exposure to ELX/TEZ/IVA. Likewise, every second CF patient with non-F508del genotypes improved in SCC and clinical outcome upon exposure to ELX/TEZ/IVA indicating that triple CFTR modulator therapy is potentially beneficial for all pwCF who do not carry two minimal function CFTR mutations. This group who is not eligible for CFTR modulators may opt for gene addition therapy in the future, as the first-in-human trial with a recombinant lentiviral vector is underway. The upcoming generation of pwCF will probably experience a rather normal life in childhood and adolescence. To classify the upcoming personal signatures of CF disease in the times of efficient modulators, we need more sensitive CFTR biomarkers that address the long-term course of airway and gut microbiome, host defense, epithelial homeostasis and multiorgan metabolism."

This study identifies the impact of ivacaftor (IVA) and elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI) on self-reported physical well-being and burden of care among adults with CF. We conducted a secondary analysis of data from the Well-ME Survey. Participants included adults with CF (age≥18) who reported taking IVA or ETI. We used a mixed methods approach to identify self-reported health status, physical well-being, and experience of CF care while taking IVA or ETI. Among 414 eligible respondents, overall health status was reported very good/excellent by 59 % (n = 243), good by 26 % (n = 114), and poor/fair by 14 % (n = 57). While the majority of respondents experienced improvements in respiratory symptoms, PwCF reporting poor/fair health were less likely to report improvement in overall physical health, fatigue, and ability to exercise compared to those with good or very good/excellent health and less likely to report improvement in pain, sinus issues, and cough than those with very good/excellent health. PwCF reporting poor/fair health or good health were less likely to report improvements in gastrointestinal issues or experience reductions in CF medications or treatments, compared to those reporting very good/excellent health. Despite improvements in respiratory symptoms, some adults with CF taking IVA or ETI report their health is poor/fair. A better understanding of physical well-being and burden of care may help identify underrecognized comorbidities to improve care."

    "abstract": "Nephronophthisis (NPH) is classified under the category of renal ciliopathies and is the most common genetic disease leading to renal failure in children. Early-onset and progressive renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis represents one of the most significant features, culminating in renal insufficiency. However, the molecular mechanism of tubulointerstitial fibrosis remains unclear. Previously, we constructed an NPH mouse model via CRISPR-Cas9. This mouse model demonstrated typical features of tubulointerstitial fibrosis. In this study, we aimed to explore the pathogenesis of tubulointerstitial fibrosis in NPH and identify early intervention targets in both the NPH models and patients. In this study, transcriptome changes in mouse kidneys were analyzed through RNA sequencing to explore the molecular mechanisms of renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis in NPH. We found an increased abundance of calpain1 in both the NPH models and patients. Pathway enrichment analysis indicated autophagy-lysosomal pathway was altered in the NPH models. Western blot, immunofluorescence or immunohistochemical staining were used to verify the expression of calpain1. We also detected autophagy activities in NPH models by lysotracker staining and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Epithelial or mesenchymal-specific markers and Masson's trichrome staining were used to detect the status of tubulointerstitial fibrosis. Furthermore, NPH models were treated with a calpain1 inhibitor to explore the role of calpain1 in autophagy-lysosomal pathway and tubulointerstitial fibrosis. The increased abundance of calpain1 impaired the autophagy-lysosomal pathway and induced tubulointerstitial fibrosis by promoting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. On the other hand, calpain1 inhibition could enhance the autophagy-lysosomal pathway and ameliorate the phenotypes of tubulointerstitial fibrosis in NPH models. Calpain1-mediated autophagy-lysosomal pathway disorder may be an important cause of tubulointerstitial fibrosis in NPH. Calpain1 may have therapeutic implications for renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis."

STAT3-HIES is characterized by chronic pulmonary infection and inflammation, suggesting impaired innate host defense. To identify airway epithelial host defense defects caused by STAT3 mutations that, together with immune dysfunction, contribute to recurrent pulmonary infections in STAT3-HIES. STAT3-HIES sputum was analyzed for biochemical and biophysical properties. STAT3-HIES excised lungs were harvested for histology; and bronchial brush samples were collected for RNA sequencing and in vitro culture. A STAT3-HIES-specific R382W mutation, expressed via lentivirus, and STAT3 knockout (CRISPR/Cas9), were studied in normal human bronchial epithelial cells under basal or inflammatory (IL1β)-stimulated conditions. Effects of STAT3 deficiency on transcriptomics, epithelial ion channel, secretory, antimicrobial, and ciliary functions were assessed. STAT3-HIES sputum showed increased mucus concentration and viscoelasticity. STAT3-HIES excised lungs exhibited mucus obstruction and elevated IL1β expression. STAT3 mutations reduced CFTR mRNA and protein levels, impaired CFTR-dependent fluid and mucin secretion, suppressed antimicrobial peptide, cytokine, and chemokine expression, and acidified airway surface liquid at baseline and post-IL1β exposure. Notably, mutant STAT3 suppressed IL1R1 expression. Furthermore, STAT3 mutations impaired multiciliogenesis by blocking commitment to ciliated cell lineages through inhibition of HES6, leading to defective mucociliary transport. Administration of a γ-secretase inhibitor restored HES6 expression, improved ciliogenesis in STAT3 R382W mutant cells. STAT3 dysfunction leads to multi-component defects in airway epithelial innate defense, which, in conjunction with immune deficiency, contributes to chronic pulmonary infection in STAT3-HIES."

    "abstract": "The current study aimed to explore patient and provider perspectives of the impact of the pandemic on cystic fibrosis healthcare access and service delivery. We used Interpretive Description, a qualitative approach with the end-goal of informing decisions and actions in clinical practice by generating findings that are clinically meaningful and useful. Levesque et al.'s \"Conceptual framework of access to health care\" informed the development of our interview guides. Interviews were conducted via telephone or Zoom and confidentially transcribed verbatim. Data generation and analysis occurred concurrently to allow for iterative refinements of the interview guides. Analysis was informed by Braun and Clarke's six phases of reflexive thematic analysis. Strategies to enhance rigour and trustworthiness of the findings were utilized. We completed 13 interviews: 8 with patients and 5 with providers. Three key themes were generated: (a) Tensions due to infection prevention at micro- meso-, and macro- levels; (b) Modifying aspects of person-focused care can bolster perceived quality of clinical encounters; and (c) Accessibility of appropriate healthcare services could improve efficiency of service delivery. Infection prevention at the individual level was not found to be burdensome. Society's compliance with public health measures, or lack thereof, impacted the level of stigma and anxiety experienced by patients with cystic fibrosis. A changed model of care reliant on patient self-report instead of clinician-led testing and in-person assessment due to the transition to virtual care was associated with mixed perceptions since patients with cystic fibrosis were comfortable making care decisions but many participants (patient and provider) felt challenged by the lack of objective data for decision-making. It was essential for patients with cystic fibrosis to feel known, heard, and seen by their providers in order to feel the care was effective. Finally, critical insights around the need for a balance of in-person and virtual care as well as the need for mental health supports were offered. The learnings from this study could be translated into practical strategies for improving cystic fibrosis care during the pandemic and beyond. We recommend: (1) a hybrid approach to care moving forward, (2) each patient having a lead physician with others filling in as necessary when scheduling demands, and (3) a reallocation of resources to fund a mental health practitioner position."

Chloride ions, the most abundant anions in the human body, act as signaling molecules, modulating cellular behavior and playing a key role in regulating multiorgan physiological and pathophysiological mechanisms. The intra‑ and extracellular distributions of chloride ions are primarily controlled by various chloride channels and transporters. Currently, these chloride channels are classified into several groups: The chloride channels family, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, calcium‑activated chloride channels, volume‑regulated anion channels, proton‑activated chloride channels and ligand‑gated anion channels. This review aims to summarize the roles of chloride ion channels and transporter proteins in digestive system diseases, providing a theoretical basis for future research and offering potential new strategies for disease treatment."

The medical history of the couple is unremarkable, with both partners phenotypically normal. Semen analysis revealed oligoasthenzoospermia (OAT), 15% sperm DNA fragmentation and 4% aneuploidies in the sperm nuclei. Genetic analysis showed no Y chromosome of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene mutations. Karyotype analysis in the male partner revealed a small supernumerary marker chromosome (sSMC) derived from chromosome 15, specifically inverted and duplicated (inv dup(15)) corresponding to the 15q11.2 region but lacking the Prader-Willi/Angelman syndrome critical region (PWACR). Further investigations revealed that 35% of the patient's spermatozoa carried the sSMC(15). This case study highlights the potential association between the presence of an inv dup(15) sSMC, without the involvement of the PWACR, and male infertility. sSMC(15) may disrupt spermatogenesis and contribute to oligoasthenozoospermia in males with primary infertility. Further research into the association of mechanism mechanisms of male infertility related to the 15q11.2 region is warranted."

    "abstract": "The exquisite ability of bacteria to adapt to their environment is essential for their capacity to colonize hostile niches. In the cystic fibrosis (CF) lung, hypoxia is among several environmental stresses that opportunistic pathogens must overcome to persist and chronically colonize. Although the role of hypoxia in the host has been widely reviewed, the impact of hypoxia on bacterial pathogens has not yet been studied extensively. This review considers the bacterial oxygen-sensing mechanisms in three species that effectively colonize the lungs of people with CF, namely Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cepacia complex, and Mycobacterium abscessus and draws parallels between their three proposed oxygen-sensing two-component systems: BfiSR, FixLJ, and DosRS, respectively. Moreover, each species expresses regulons that respond to hypoxia: Anr, Lxa, and DosR, and encode multiple proteins that share similar homologies and function. Many adaptations that these pathogens undergo during chronic infection, including antibiotic resistance, protease expression, or changes in motility, have parallels in the responses of the respective species to hypoxia. It is likely that exposure to hypoxia in their environmental habitats predispose these pathogens to colonization of hypoxic niches, arming them with mechanisms than enable their evasion of the immune system and establish chronic infections. Overcoming hypoxia presents a new target for therapeutic options against chronic lung infections."

This analysis included data from 2800 PwCF. >75 % of PwCF with chronic Pa were prescribed inhaled antibiotics, while up to 13 % of PwCF negative for Pa received inhaled antibiotics during the study period. There was an increased risk of developing A. fumigatus among PwCF with intermittent Pa (HR 1.43, 95 %CI; 1.08-1.88; p = 0.01) and who were Pa negative (HR 2.44, 95 %CI; 1.65-3.61; p < 0.001), but not for PwCF with chronic Pa (HR 1.36, 95 %CI; 0.94-1.95; p = 0.10). No association was seen between inhaled antibiotics and developing either S. maltophilia or Achromobacter spp. Inhaled antibiotic use among Canadian PwCF was associated with an increased risk of A. fumigatus acquisition but not S. maltophilia or Achromobacter spp. Prospective studies are needed to better define this association."

    "title": "DIAGNOSTIC MANAGEMENT OF PEDIATRIC BRONCHIECTASIS: A LITERATURE REVIEW AND CLINICAL EXAMPLES.",
    "abstract": "bronchiectasis is an often underdiagnosed chronic respiratory disease in children and adolescents. Recent international guidelines highlighted the management of bronchiectasis in pediatric patients in comparison to adults. The purpose of this manuscript is to review the diagnostic, etiological work-up and follow-up in children and adolescents with bronchiectasis, using real-life clinical cases that highlight the multidisciplinary approach required for this complex condition. the diagnostic process requires both thoracic imaging and a clinical evaluation with the addition of pulmonary function tests and microbiological exams, when possible. Specific work-up should include past medical history (e.g. recurrent pneumonia, otitis or extra-respiratory infections), including family history, testing for genetic diseases (e.g. cystic fibrosis), evaluation of airways abnormalities and obstruction (e.g. bronchial foreign body), exclusion of concomitant immunodeficiencies and conditions associated to impaired mucociliary clearance. Main comorbidities and possible etiological conditions include chronic pulmonary aspiration and gastro-esophageal reflux, upper respiratory tract and otologic diseases, particularly rhinosinusitis, otitis, and asthma. Patients should be followed up every 3 to 6 months, with closer monitoring for those with severe disease; transition to adult care should be individualized, with emphasis on patient education, treatment adherence and multidisciplinary support. the diagnostic work-up for children and adolescents with bronchiectasis is challenging and requires input from multiple experts. Early detection of bronchiectasis is crucial for establishing effective diagnostic and therapeutic strategies and may help prevent further progression."

    "abstract": "<i>Mycobacterium abscessus</i> is a rapidly growing nontuberculous <i>Mycobacterium</i> causing severe pulmonary infections, especially in immunocompromised individuals and patients with underlying lung conditions like cystic fibrosis (CF). While rifamycins are the pillar of tuberculosis treatment, their efficacy against <i>M. abscessus</i> lung disease is severely compromised by intrabacterial ADP-ribosylation. Additionally, rifamycins induce cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), a major human drug-metabolizing enzyme, further limiting their use in patients with comorbidities that require treatment with CYP3A4 substrates such as CF and HIV coinfection. We chemically reengineered rifabutin to enhance its potency against <i>M. abscessus</i> by blocking intrabacterial inactivation and eliminate drug-drug interactions by removing induction of CYP3A4 gene expression. We have designed and profiled a series of C25-substituted derivatives resistant to intracellular inactivation and lacking CYP3A4 induction, while retaining excellent pharmacological properties. Against <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>, devoid of ADP-ribosyltransferase, the frontrunners are equipotent to rifabutin, suggesting superior clinical utility since they no longer come with the drug interaction liability typical of rifamycins. Prioritized compounds demonstrated superior antibacterial activity against a panel of <i>M. abscessus</i> clinical isolates, were highly bactericidal against replicating and drug-tolerant nonreplicating bacteria in caseum surrogate and were active against intracellular bacteria. As single agents, these rifamycins were as effective as a standard-of-care four-drug combination in a murine model of <i>M. abscessus</i> lung infection."

    "abstract": "Chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections are a leading cause of acute pulmonary exacerbations in people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF). Intrinsic antibiotic resistance and biofilm formation complicate treatment. This study investigates the genomic diversity and cefiderocol efficacy against planktonic and biofilm-associated forms of P. aeruginosa isolates from pwCF. Eight P. aeruginosa clinical isolates and three laboratory strains underwent whole genome sequencing (WGS). Biofilm formation was assessed through biomass, cell count, metabolic activity, and extracellular DNA (eDNA). The minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC<sub>90</sub>) and biofilm eradication concentration (MBEC<sub>90</sub>) were also determined. WGS revealed significant genomic diversity, identifying ten distinct sequence types (STs). Antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) showed that 10/11 strains were susceptible to cefiderocol, with one isolate (MPA9) displaying resistance linked to the bla<sub>OXA486</sub> gene. Adding the β-lactamase inhibitor avibactam (AVI) restored susceptibility in this resistant strain. Although iron metabolism genes were highly conserved across isolates, MPA9 lacked the fpvA iron receptor, potentially contributing to cefiderocol resistance. Biofilm formation significantly increased tolerance to cefiderocol, with an 8-fold rise in MBEC<sub>90</sub> compared to MBC<sub>90</sub>. These findings highlight the genomic diversity and adaptive potential of P. aeruginosa in pwCF. Cefiderocol shows promise against planktonic and biofilm-associated P. aeruginosa, and combining it with AVI may counteract β-lactamase-mediated resistance."

    "abstract": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a multisystem autosomal recessive disease arising from mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. Dysfunction of the CFTR protein leads to progressive pulmonary disease, pancreatic exocrine insufficiency, and nutritional deficiencies. Survival has significantly increased over the last several decades due to improved pulmonary and nutritional management, including CFTR modulator therapy. The adult CF population now faces new challenges of aging, such as menopause-related symptoms and age-related osteoporosis superimposed on underlying CF-related bone disease. The menopausal transition and early postmenopause are characterized by rapid bone loss and represent a window of opportunity to preserve bone mass. Menopausal hormone therapy may alleviate vasomotor symptoms and improve bone density in appropriately selected people. This review will discuss the current knowledge of menopause and bone health in females with CF, address CF-specific considerations on osteoporosis and menopause treatment options, and explore opportunities for future areas of research."

    "abstract": "Anti-melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 dermatomyositis (MDA5<sup>+</sup>DM) is a potentially fatal subtype of dermatomyositis. The most severe cases are characterized by rapidly progressive interstitial lung disease (RPILD), the leading cause of death in these patients. There is currently no curative treatment for these patients, and indeed, MDA5<sup>+</sup>DM-RPILD is considered one of the most challenging pathologies in medicine. Nevertheless, the recent introduction of CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapies appears to offer a serious opportunity to develop solutions for complex autoimmune diseases refractory to multiple immunosuppressant treatments, mainly rheumatic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, dermatomyositis, and systemic lupus erythematosus. In this report, we describe the first use of a second-generation CD19 CAR-T cell therapy (ARI-0001) in a pediatric patient with severe MDA5<sup>+</sup>DM-RPILD. Conventional treatments stabilized MDA5<sup>+</sup>DM-RPILD before CAR-T cell inoculation (-34 days). The presence of CD19<sup>+</sup> B lymphocytes that might serve as target cells in deeper tissues was suspected due to CAR-T cell expansion in a context of B cell aplasia. No fever or cytokine release syndrome/cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome was evident. In global terms, B cell reconstitution and cutaneous, motor, respiratory, and neurological improvements were observed gradually in the patient in an immunosuppressant-free context (-7 to +325 days). A pediatric patient with aggressive MDA5<sup>+</sup>DM-RPILD achieved progressive long-term improvement and immunosuppressant-free remission over 11 months after compassionate use of a CD19 CAR-T cell therapy (ARI-0001). This work was supported by the Programa Investigo (PI_SEPE_APM) and grants from the ISC-III (PI22/01226) from the Comunidad de Madrid (S2022/BMD-7225) and from the CRIS Cancer Foundation."

    "abstract": "The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a chloride channel residing primarily at the apical membrane of epithelial cells, plays a major role in fluid secretion and the maintenance of epithelial surface hydration. Mutations in the CFTR gene lead to the fatal disease known as cystic fibrosis (CF). Drugs that improve mutant CFTR protein folding and channel function have dramatically improved CF patient outcomes. However, the current regimen only restores the function of the most common mutant, ΔF508, to ~62% of wildtype (WT). Notably, ~10% of patients harboring hundreds of less common CFTR mutations are not eligible or do not respond at all to treatment with current CFTR modulators. Better characterizing the WT and mutant CFTR protein interactomes could provide critical insight into how to treat patients with rarer mutations and thereby improve the druggability of this devastating disease. Here we describe how BioID (proximity-dependent biotin identification) can be used to map the CFTR interactome in a human airway model-bronchial epithelial cells grown at the air-liquid interface. Approximately 26% (>5500) of all human protein-coding genes are predicted to code for membrane proteins, which together account for ~30% of the druggable proteome. The methods described here could thus also be applied to improve our understanding of many additional respiratory, autoimmune, and metabolic diseases."

    "abstract": "Macrophages play a pivotal role in the progression of atherosclerosis (AS), and targeting macrophage-associated pathological processes has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy for AS. Flavonoids have demonstrated potent antioxidant properties with potential anti-atherosclerotic effects. This study aimed to investigate the therapeutic effects of the flavonoid calycosin-7-glucoside (CG) on AS and elucidate its underlying molecular mechanisms. Macrophages were differentiated from human monocytic THP-1 cells by treatment with phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA). Foam cell formation was induced by exposing differentiated macrophages to oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL). Protein and inflammatory cytokine expression levels were assessed using RT-qPCR, Western blot, and ELISA assays. Total cholesterol and free cholesterol levels were quantified using commercial kits, and lipid droplet accumulation was visualized using Nile red staining. Activation of activating transcription factor 1 (ATF-1) was found to mediate CG-induced suppression of inflammatory responses and foam cell formation in ox-LDL-exposed THP-1-derived macrophages. CG treatment enhanced p38 MAPK activity, which was responsible for ATF-1 activation and subsequent inhibition of inflammation and foam cell formation. Mechanistically, ATF-1 facilitated CG-induced anti-atherosclerotic effects by upregulating liver X receptor beta (LXR-β) and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), which are critical for lipid metabolism and inflammation regulation, respectively. CG attenuates ox-LDL-induced foam cell formation and inflammatory responses in THP-1-derived macrophages by activating the p38 MAPK/ATF-1 signaling pathway, leading to the upregulation of LXR-β and CFTR. These findings highlight the potential of CG as a therapeutic agent for AS."

    "abstract": "Neonatal cholestasis is a group of disorders characterised by conjugated hyperbilirubinemia in the newborns and young infants. Advances in genetic testing have facilitated the identification of specific aetiology. This study examines the genetic and clinical profiles of neonates with cholestasis, focusing on genotype-phenotype correlations and diagnostic outcomes. A retrospective review of children with neonatal cholestasis treated between 1997 and 2024 was conducted. Extrahepatic causes were excluded, and genetic testing, including a targeted cholestasis panel and whole exome sequencing (WES), was employed. Clinical and biochemical data, including gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) levels, were collected. Genetic disorders were identified in 28.0% of 378 cases, including mutations in ATP8B1, ABCB11, ABCB4, DCDC2, DGUOK, KIF12, USP53, and genes related to bile acid synthesis (HSD3B7, PEX1). GGT levels played a significant role in diagnosis: patients with low or normal GGT were frequently diagnosed with progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC)1 and 2, or bile acid synthesis defects, while high GGT levels were associated with PFIC3, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, and cystic fibrosis. Consanguinity was noted in 56.0% of genetically diagnosed cases. After 2010, 35.5% of patients received a genetic diagnosis, compared to 18.2% before 2010. Genetic diseases are a major cause of neonatal cholestasis, and GGT levels serve as a useful diagnostic tool in differentiating subtypes. The increasing availability of genetic testing has improved early diagnosis and personalised management. Expanded genetic testing in clinical practice is critical for timely and accurate diagnosis of these rare disorders."

    "abstract": "The high variety of mutations found in the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Regulator (CFTR) gene is responsible for the clinical heterogeneity observed in people with Cystic Fibrosis (CF) and the atypical manifestations in CFTR-related disorders (CFTR-RD). The intronic c.489+3A>G (c.621+3A>G) variant has been reported to have questionable pathogenicity, although its alleged severity was probably due to its co-segregation in cis with another undetected mutation, as previously reported from countries in the Mediterranean region. In the island of Cyprus, several rare CFTR variants have been previously identified, among them the c.489+3A>G in co-segregation with the pathogenic p.Cys1400Ter (cDNA name = c.4200_4201del or legacy name = 4332delTG) mutation. We aimed to investigate the prevalence of these variants in Cyprus and describe their clinical impact in patients and carriers. The intronic variant c.489+3A>G has been so far identified to co-segregate with the pathogenic p.Cys1400Ter mutation in the same allele in six unrelated Cypriot families and in total of 20 subjects. Three of them were diagnosed with CF, presenting with persistent respiratory symptoms, pancreatic insufficiency and a second CF-causing mutation. Two were diagnosed with CFTR-RD, presenting with bronchiectasis, intermediate sweat test and a second mutation known to cause CFTR-RD. Also, four carriers had a high suspicion of CFTR-RD, with bronchiectasis or emphysema and intermediate sweat test, although due to the lack of another CFTR mutation and a second functional test, definite diagnosis has not been made. Haplotype analysis provided evidence of a common haplotype in all individuals with co-segregation of the c.489+3A>G variant with p.Cys1400Ter mutation. The intronic c.489+3A>G variant co-segregates extensively with p.Cys1400Ter in Cyprus as an ancestral combination due to a possible founder effect. Before providing genetic counselling to subjects identified through population screening to harbour the c.489+3A>G variant, extensive analysis of CFTR including gene rearrangements should be performed to identify possible other mutations in cis, especially in Mediterranean countries where this complex allele is probably common. Further research is warranted to fully delineate the clinical implications of the in cis co-segregation of p.Cys1400Ter with c.489+3A>G, even in the absence of pathogenic variants in the other CFTR allele."

Cystic fibrosis, a disease complicated by recurrent Pseudomonas aeruginosa pulmonary infections, is an example of the clinical impact of antimicrobial resistance. Here, using a personalized phage therapy strategy that selects phages for a predicted evolutionary trade-off, nine adults with cystic fibrosis (eight women and one man) of median age 32 (range 22-46) years were treated with phages on a compassionate basis because their clinical course was complicated by multidrug-resistant or pan-drug-resistant Pseudomonas that was refractory to prior courses of standard antibiotics. The individuals received a nebulized cocktail or single-phage therapy without adverse events. Five to 18 days after phage therapy, sputum Pseudomonas decreased by a median of 10<sup>4</sup> CFU ml<sup>-1</sup>, or a mean difference of 10<sup>2</sup> CFU ml<sup>-1</sup> (P = 0.006, two-way analysis of variance with Dunnett's multiple-comparisons test), without altering sputum microbiome, and an analysis of sputum Pseudomonas showed evidence of trade-offs that decreased antibiotic resistance or bacterial virulence. In addition, an improvement of 6% (median) and 8% (mean) predicted FEV<sub>1</sub> was observed 21-35 days after phage therapy (P = 0.004, Wilcoxon signed-rank t-test), which may reflect the combined effects of decreased bacterial sputum density and phage-driven trade-offs. These results show that a personalized, nebulized phage therapy trade-off strategy may affect clinical and microbiologic endpoints, which must be evaluated in larger clinical trials."

Advances in treatment have extended life expectancy, yet there remains a significant economic burden to manage CF. Cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) is crucial for evaluating the economic value of treatments and screening for CF. This scoping review seeks to highlight the best practices and gaps in the current evidence base, contributing to robust and comparable CEAs in CF research. A scoping review was conducted using PubMed and Embase. Studies were included if they featured a CEA focused on CF treatment. Data extraction covered study characteristics, model inputs, and modeling assumptions. A qualitative synthesis was conducted to assess the inclusion of considerations for both healthcare and societal impacts. In total, 11 studies were included. Of these, six focused on evaluations of supportive therapies for CF and five focused on evaluation of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators. Heterogeneity in comparators and drug costing methods complicated cross-study comparisons. A qualitative review revealed differences in the types of costs and outcomes considered. Studies captured long-term disease progression, health-related quality-of-life effects, and direct medical costs. This review highlights the complexity of CEAs for CF treatment and underscores the need for standardized methodologies and comprehensive evaluations, including broader economic impacts, to support more robust analyses and better-informed decision-making in CF treatment."

We analyzed longitudinal clinical data from 6 North American lung transplant centers to elucidate the effect of gliptin exposure on CLAD development after lung transplantation. This cohort included 6 North American lung transplant centers, 4 sites from the Clinical Trials in Organ Transplantation-20 study and 2 additional sites. First lung transplant recipients between December 2015 and August 2018 were eligible with follow-up through June 2021. Gliptin exposures before CLAD onset, in addition to CLAD risk factors, were included in the models. The primary end-point was a composite of probable CLAD, CLAD-related deaths, and CLAD-related retransplant. Cox regression models were used to assess the association between gliptin use and the CLAD composite end-point. Seven hundred and seventy-nine patients met inclusion criteria, with 126 (16.2%) having any gliptin exposure. Two hundred and thirty-three (29.9%) patients experienced probable CLAD composite outcome. Across all centers, gliptin exposure at any point was not associated with probable CLAD or definite CLAD across the study period. In a posthoc analysis of centers with median gliptin exposures >6 months, exposure within the first 90 days post-transplant was associated with a decreased risk of definite CLAD composite across the study period (hazard ratio [HR] 0.25; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.07, 0.83; p < 0.05). The association of gliptins and CLAD is complex, but early gliptin use may help protect against CLAD if started within 90 days post-transplant and used for a prolonged period."

    "abstract": "Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a genetic disorder that is characterized by the development of fluid-filled kidney cysts, which often lead to kidney failure. The vasopressin receptor 2 antagonist, tolvaptan, is the only approved treatment that slows the progression of ADPKD. There is an unmet need for treatment options for patients with ADPKD because tolvaptan has limited efficacy and non-negligible side effects. In vitro and in vivo data suggest that inhibition of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) may be a suitable approach to treating ADPKD. Here, we assessed the capacity of GLPG2737, a CFTR inhibitor, to inhibit cyst growth in preclinical models of ADPKD. We investigated the ability of GLPG2737 to modulate CFTR activity in mouse kidney inner medullary collecting duct (mIMCD-3) epithelial cells by measuring chloride flux and to prevent cyst growth in mIMCD-3 cells, cells from human ADPKD kidney donors, and metanephric organ cultures (MOCs). We assessed cyst volume, kidney weight or volume, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) in two mouse ADPKD models (Pkd1 kidney-specific knockout mouse model; Pkd1RC/RC mouse model) that received GLPG2737, tolvaptan, or their combination. Statistical tests used for data analysis were based on the normality and variance of the data. GLPG2737 inhibited chloride flux in mIMCD-3 cells with an IC50 of 2.41 µ<sc>m</sc>. In a 3D assay, GLPG2737 inhibited cyst growth in both wild-type (IC50 = 2.36 µ<sc>m</sc>) and Pkd1 knockout (IC50 = 2.5 µ<sc>m</sc>) mIMCD-3 cells. Preincubation of human ADPKD kidney cells with 10 µ<sc>m</sc> of GLPG2737, 10 µ<sc>m</sc> of tolvaptan, or their combination prevented forskolin-induced cyst growth by 40%, 29%, and 70%, respectively. Furthermore, 10 µ<sc>m</sc> of GLPG2737 inhibited cyst growth in MOCs, decreasing the cyst area by 67% and the number of cysts per area by 46% after 6 days of culture. In both in vivo models, GLPG2737, tolvaptan, or their combination improved the projected cyst volume. In the Pkd1RC/RC model, GLPG2737 also improved the total kidney volume normalized to tibia length (LnTKV) and BUN, while tolvaptan improved the LnTKV and fibrosis but did not lower BUN at sacrifice. The combination reduced all parameters measured in the Pkd1RC/RC model, including cyclic adenosine monophosphate content in the kidneys. Our findings in preclinical models provide evidence of the therapeutic potential of CFTR inhibition and its possible combination with tolvaptan. The present work shows that targeting CFTR is a valid strategy to slow ADPKD progression."

    "abstract": "With over 54,000 people affected, cystic fibrosis is one of the most common rare diseases in Europe. As life expectancy of this disease has steadily increased in recent years, the transition from pediatric to adult care has become a principal issue. This study aimed to identify facilitating and hindering factors in the transitional care of cystic fibrosis patients in order to derive indications for improving care. A qualitative systematized review was conducted in May 2024 with a systematic search carried out in MEDLINE, CINAHL and Livivo, including European studies from 2009 to 2024. The studies' quality was assessed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme checklist for qualitative studies. Thematic analysis was applied for analyzing the data to identify categories. Nine studies met the inclusion criteria. Their quality can be rated as medium to high. Parental support, commitment and social support were identified as beneficial factors. Preparation for the transition, appropriate communication and continuous follow-ups at the adult center also contributed to a continuous transition. However, the parents' changing roles, fears and the usual treatment in pediatrics were obstacles. The adjustment to the adult center and structural problems presented further barriers to transition. Various factors were identified to influence the transition process in cystic fibrosis, with consistency across the studies. In practice, comprehensive care is required, focused on the patients' needs, with more information provided and enhanced collaboration among stakeholders. Further research regarding the long-term effects of transition and the utilization of structured transition programs is needed."

    "abstract": "The prolonged persistence of extracellular chromatin and DNA is a salient feature of diseases like cystic fibrosis, systemic lupus erythematosus and COVID-19 associated microangiopathy. Since deoxyribonuclease I (DNase1) is a major endonuclease involved in DNA-related waste disposal, recombinant DNase1 is an important therapeutic biologic. Recently we described the production of recombinant murine DNase1 (rmDNase1) in Pichia pastoris by employing the α-mating factor prepro signal peptide (αMF-SP) a method, which we now applied to express recombinant human DNASE1 (rhDNASE1). In addition to an impaired cleavage of the αMF pro-peptide, which we also detected previously for mDNase1, expression of hDNASE1 resulted in a 70-80 times lower yield although both orthologues share a high structural and functional homology. Using mDNase1 expression as a guideline, we were able to increase the yield of hDNASE1 fourfold by optimizing parameters like nutrients, cultivation temperature, methanol supply, and codon usage. In addition, post-translational import into the rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER) was changed to co-translational import by employing the signal peptide (SP) of the α-subunit of the Oligosaccharyltransferase complex (Ost1) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These improvements resulted in the purification of ~ 8 mg pure mature rmDNase1 and ~ 0.4 mg rhDNASE1 per Liter expression medium of a culture with a cell density of OD600 = 40 in 24 hours. As a main cause for the expression difference, we assume varying folding abilities to reach a native conformation, which induce an elevated unproductive unfolded protein response within the rER during hDNASE1 expression. Concerning functionality, rhDNASE1 expressed in P. pastoris is comparable to Pulmozyme®, i.e. rhDNASE1 produced in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells by Roche - Genentech. With respect to the biochemical effectivity, rmDNase1 is superior to rhDNASE1 due to its higher specific activity in the presence of Ca2 + /Mg2 + and the lower inhibition by monomeric actin."

    "title": "Repurposing High-Throughput Screening Reveals Unconventional Drugs with Antimicrobial and Antibiofilm Potential Against Methicillin-Resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> from a Cystic Fibrosis Patient.",
    "abstract": "<b>Background/Objectives:</b> Antibiotic therapy faces challenges from rising acquired and biofilm-related antibiotic resistance rates. High resistance levels to commonly used antibiotics have been observed in methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (MRSA) strains among cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, indicating an urgent need for new antibacterial agents. This study aimed to identify potential novel therapeutics with antibacterial and antibiofilm activities against an MRSA CF strain by screening, for the first time, the Drug Repurposing Compound Library (MedChem Express). <b>Methods/Results:</b> Among the 3386 compounds, a high-throughput screening-based spectrophotometric approach identified 2439 (72%), 654 (19.3%), and 426 (12.6%) drugs active against planktonic cells, biofilm formation, and preformed biofilm, respectively, although to different extents. The most active hits were 193 (5.7%), against planktonic cells, causing a 100% growth inhibition; 5 (0.14%), with excellent activity against biofilm formation (i.e., reduction ≥ 90%); and 4, showing high activity (i.e., 60% ≤ biofilm reduction < 90%) against preformed biofilms. The potential hits belonged to several primary research areas, with \"cancer\" being the most prevalent. After performing a literature review to identify other, already published biological properties that could be relevant to the CF lung environment (i.e., activity against other CF pathogens, and anti-inflammatory and anti-virulence potential), the most interesting hits were the following: 5-(N,N-Hexamethylene)-amiloride (diuretic), Toremifene (anticancer), Zafirlukast (antiasthmatic), Fenretide (anticancer), and Montelukast (antiasthmatic) against planktonic <i>S. aureus</i> cells; Hemin against biofilm formation; and Heparin, Clemastine (antihistaminic), and Bromfenac (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory) against established biofilms. <b>Conclusions:</b> These findings warrant further in vitro and in vivo studies to confirm the potential of repurposing these compounds for managing lung infections caused by <i>S. aureus</i> in CF patients."

    "abstract": "Persistent bacterial airway infection is a hallmark feature of cystic fibrosis (CF). <i>Achromobacter</i> spp. are gram-negative rods that can cause persistent airway infection in people with CF (pwCF), but the knowledge of host immune responses to these bacteria is limited. The aim of this study was to investigate if patients develop antibodies against <i>Achromobacter xylosoxidans</i>, the most common <i>Achromobacter</i> species, and to identify the bacterial antigens that induce specific IgG responses. Seven serum samples from pwCF with <i>Achromobacter</i> infection were screened for antibodies against bacteria in an ELISA coated with <i>A. xylosoxidans</i>, <i>A. insuavis,</i> or <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>. Sera from pwCF with or without <i>P. aeruginosa</i> infection (<i>n</i> = 22 and 20, respectively) and healthy donors (<i>n</i> = 4) were included for comparison. Serum with high titers to <i>A. xylosoxidans</i> was selected for affinity purification of bacterial antigens using serum IgGs bound to protein G beads. The resulting IgG-antigen complexes were then analyzed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Selected antigens of interest were produced in recombinant form and used in an ELISA to confirm the results. Four of the seven patients with <i>Achromobacter</i> infection had serum antibodies against <i>Achromobacter</i>. Using patient serum-IgG for affinity purification of <i>A. xylosoxidans</i> proteins, we identified eight antigens. Three of these, which were not targeted by anti-<i>P</i>. <i>aeruginosa</i> antibodies, were expressed recombinantly for further validation: dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase (DLD), type I secretion C-terminal target domain-containing protein, and domain of uncharacterized function 336 (DUF336). While specific IgG against all three recombinant antigens was confirmed in the patient serum with high titers against <i>Achromobacter</i>, DLD and DUF336 showed the least binding to serum IgG from pwCF without <i>Achromobacter</i> spp. infection. Using serum IgG affinity purification in combination with LC-MS/MS and confirming the results using ELISA against recombinant proteins, we have identified bacterial antigens from <i>A. xylosoxidans</i>.IMPORTANCE<i>Achromobacter</i> species are opportunistic pathogens that can cause airway infections in people with cystic fibrosis. In this patient population, persistent <i>Achromobacter</i> infection is associated with low lung function, but the knowledge about bacterial interactions with the host is currently limited. In this study, we identify protein antigens that induce specific antibody responses in the host. The identified antigens may potentially be useful in serological assays, serving as a complement to culturing methods for the diagnosis and surveillance of <i>Achromobacter</i> infection."

    "title": "Cystic fibrosis therapy: from symptoms to the cause of the disease.",
    "abstract": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a disease with a broad clinical and genetic spectrum of manifestations, significantly impacting the quality and duration of life of patients. At present, a diagnosis of CF enables the disease to be identified at the earliest stages of its development. The accelerated advancement of scientific knowledge and contemporary research techniques has transformed the methodology employed in the treatment of CF, encompassing a spectrum of approaches from symptomatic management to pathogenetic therapies. Pathogenetic therapy represents an approach to treatment that aims to identify methods of restoring the function of the CFTR gene. The objective of this review was to analyse and summarize the available scientific data on the pathogenetic therapy of CF. This paper considers various approaches to the pathogenetic therapy of CF that are based on the use of targeted drugs known as CFTR modulators. The article presents studies employing gene therapy techniques for CF, which are based on the targeted delivery of a normal copy of the CFTR gene cDNA to the respiratory tract via viral or non-viral vectors. Some studies have demonstrated the efficacy of RNA therapeutic interventions in restoring splicing, promoting the production of mature RNA, and increasing the functional expression of the CFTR protein. The review also analyzes literature data that consider methods of etiotropic therapy for CF, which consists of targeted correction of the CFTR gene using artificial restriction enzymes, the CRISPR/Cas9 system and a complex of peptide-nucleic acids. In a prospective plan, the use of cell therapy methods in the treatment of lung damage in CF is considered."

    "abstract": "Immune cell differentials are most commonly performed manually or with the use of automated cell sorting devices. However, manual review by research personnel can be both subjective and time consuming, and cell sorting approaches consume samples and demand additional reagents to perform the differential. We have created an artificial intelligence (AI) image processing pipeline using the Biodock.ai platform to classify immune cell types from Giemsa-stained cytospins of mouse bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Through multiple rounds of training and refinement, we have created a tool that is as accurate as manual review of slide images while removing the subjectivity and making the process mostly hands off, saving researcher time for other tasks and improving core turnaround for experiments. This AI-based image processing is directly compatible with current workflows utilizing stained slides, in contrast to a change to a flow cytometry-based approach, which requires both specialized equipment, reagents, and expertise."

    "title": "Trojan Horse-Like Vehicles for CRISPR-Cas Delivery: Engineering Extracellular Vesicles and Virus-Like Particles for Precision Gene Editing in Cystic Fibrosis.",
    "abstract": "The advent of genome editing has kindled the hope to cure previously uncurable, life-threatening genetic diseases. However, whether this promise can be ultimately fulfilled depends on how efficiently gene editing agents can be delivered to therapeutically relevant cells. Over time, viruses have evolved into sophisticated, versatile, and biocompatible nanomachines that can be engineered to shuttle payloads to specific cell types. Despite the advances in safety and selectivity, the long-term expression of gene editing agents sustained by viral vectors remains a cause for concern. Cell-derived vesicles (CDVs) are gaining traction as elegant alternatives. CDVs encompass extracellular vesicles (EVs), a diverse set of intrinsically biocompatible and low-immunogenic membranous nanoparticles, and virus-like particles (VLPs), bioparticles with virus-like scaffold and envelope structures, but devoid of genetic material. Both EVs and VLPs can efficiently deliver ribonucleoprotein cargo to the target cell cytoplasm, ensuring that the editing machinery is only transiently active in the cell and thereby increasing its safety. In this review, we explore the natural diversity of CDVs and their potential as delivery vectors for the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) machinery. We illustrate different strategies for the optimization of CDV cargo loading and retargeting, highlighting the versatility and tunability of these vehicles. Nonetheless, the lack of robust and standardized protocols for CDV production, purification, and quality assessment still hinders their widespread adoption to further CRISPR-based therapies as advanced \"living drugs.\" We believe that a collective, multifaceted effort is urgently needed to address these critical issues and unlock the full potential of genome-editing technologies to yield safe, easy-to-manufacture, and pharmacologically well-defined therapies. Finally, we discuss the current clinical landscape of lung-directed gene therapies for cystic fibrosis and explore how CDVs could drive significant breakthroughs in <i>in vivo</i> gene editing for this disease."

    "title": "Non-Cystic Fibrosis Bronchiectasis in Adults: A Review.",
    "abstract": "Non-cystic fibrosis (CF) bronchiectasis is a chronic lung condition caused by permanent bronchial dilatation and inflammation and is characterized by daily cough, sputum, and recurrent exacerbations. Approximately 500 000 people in the US have non-CF bronchiectasis. Non-CF bronchiectasis may be associated with prior pneumonia, infection with nontuberculous mycobacteria or tuberculosis, genetic conditions (eg, α1-antitrypsin deficiency, primary ciliary dyskinesia), autoimmune diseases (eg, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease), allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, and immunodeficiency syndromes (eg, common variable immunodeficiency). Up to 38% of cases are idiopathic. According to US data, conditions associated with non-CF bronchiectasis include gastroesophageal reflux disease (47%), asthma (29%), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (20%). The prevalence of non-CF bronchiectasis increases substantially with age (7 per 100 000 in individuals 18-34 years vs 812 per 100 000 in those ≥75 years) and is more common in women than men (180 vs 95 per 100 000). Diagnosis is confirmed with noncontrast chest computed tomography showing dilated airways and often airway thickening and mucus plugging. Initial diagnostic evaluation involves blood testing (complete blood cell count with differential); immunoglobulin quantification testing (IgG, IgA, IgE, and IgM); sputum cultures for bacteria, mycobacteria, and fungi; and prebronchodilator and postbronchodilator spirometry. Treatment includes airway clearance techniques; nebulization of saline to loosen tenacious secretions; and regular exercise, participation in pulmonary rehabilitation, or both. Inhaled bronchodilators (β-agonists and antimuscarinic agents) and inhaled corticosteroids are indicated for patients with bronchiectasis who have asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Exacerbations of bronchiectasis, which typically present with increased cough and sputum and worsened fatigue, are associated with progressive decline in lung function and decreased quality of life. Exacerbations should be treated with oral or intravenous antibiotics. Individuals with 3 or more exacerbations of bronchiectasis annually may benefit from long-term inhaled antibiotics (eg, colistin, gentamicin) or daily oral macrolides (eg, azithromycin). Lung transplant may be considered for patients with severely impaired pulmonary function, frequent exacerbations, or both. Among patients with non-CF bronchiectasis, mortality is higher for those with frequent and severe exacerbations, infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and comorbidities, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Non-CF bronchiectasis is a chronic lung condition that typically causes chronic cough and daily sputum production. Exacerbations are associated with progressive decline in lung function and decreased quality of life. Management involves treatment of conditions associated with bronchiectasis, airway clearance techniques, oral or intravenous antibiotics for acute exacerbations, and consideration of long-term inhaled antibiotics or oral macrolides for patients with 3 or more exacerbations annually."

    "abstract": "According to estimates, globally more than 200,000 pregnant women develop tuberculosis (TB) annually. Despite this, data on perinatal TB remain scarce. This study aimed to describe perinatal TB, comprising congenital (cTB) and postnatal (pTB) TB, in a European setting. Retrospective cohort study via the Paediatric Tuberculosis Network European Trials Group (ptbnet) capturing and comparing cases of cTB and pTB diagnosed at 104 participating European healthcare institutions between 1995 and 2019. Forty-six cases reported by 20 centres were included in the final analysis (cTB, n = 27; pTB, n = 19). Median age at symptom onset was one week in cTB (IQR: 0-1 weeks), and 12 weeks in pTB patients (IQR: 5-18 weeks). Prematurity was more common in cTB than pTB patients [57.9% (11/19); 95% CI: 36.3-76.9% vs. 21.1% (4/19); 95% CI: 8.5-43.3%; p = 0.049], and the average birth weight was significantly lower [1680 g; IQR: 932-2805 g vs. 2890 g; IQR: 2461-3400 g; p = 0.0043]. Microbiological confirmation was achieved in most patients [85.2% (23/27); 95% CI: 67.5-94.1% vs. 78.9% (15/19); 95% CI: 56.7-91.5%; p = 0.70]. The sensitivity of interferon-gamma release assays was poor in both groups [25.0% (3/12) 95% CI: 8.9-53.2% vs. 35.7% (5/14) 95% CI: 16.3-61.2%; p = 0.68]; in contrast, the sensitivity of the tuberculin skin tests (at 5 mm cut-off) was significantly higher in pTB patients [16.7% (2/12) 95% CI: 4.7-44.8% vs. 66.7% (10/15); 95% CI: 41.7-84.8%; p = 0.0185]. Approximately half of the patients required intensive care support [51.9% (14/27) 95% CI: 34.0-69.3% vs. 47.4% (9/19); 95% CI: 27.3-68.3%; p > 0.99]. Four (4/46; 8.7%) patients died, and four (4/46; 8.7%) had severe long-term sequelae. There was substantial mortality and morbidity in this patient cohort, despite the high-resource setting. cTB was associated with premature birth and low birth weight. In contrast to microbiological tests, immunological tests perform poorly in perinatal TB, and should therefore not be used as rule-out tests. No study-specific funding."

    "abstract": "Dysregulated neutrophil recruitment drives many pulmonary diseases, but most preclinical screening methods are unsuited to evaluate pulmonary neutrophilia, limiting progress toward therapeutics. Namely, high-throughput therapeutic assays typically exclude critical neutrophilic pathophysiology, including blood-to-lung recruitment, dysfunctional activation, and resulting impacts on the air-blood barrier. To meet the conflicting demands of physiological complexity and high throughput, we developed an assay of 96-well leukocyte recruitment in an air-blood barrier array (L-ABBA-96) that enables <i>in vivo</i>-like neutrophil recruitment compatible with downstream phenotyping by automated flow cytometry. We modeled acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with neutrophil recruitment to 20 ng/mL epithelial-side interleukin 8 and found a dose-dependent reduction in recruitment with physiologic doses of baricitinib, a JAK1/2 inhibitor recently Food and Drug Administration-approved for severe Coronavirus Disease 2019 ARDS. Additionally, neutrophil recruitment to patient-derived cystic fibrosis sputum supernatant induced disease-mimetic recruitment and activation of healthy donor neutrophils and upregulated endothelial e-selectin. Compared to 24-well assays, the L-ABBA-96 reduces required patient sample volumes by 25 times per well and quadruples throughput per plate. Compared to microfluidic assays, the L-ABBA-96 recruits two orders of magnitude more neutrophils per well, enabling downstream flow cytometry and other standard biochemical assays. This novel pairing of high-throughput <i>in vitro</i> modeling of organ-level lung function with parallel high-throughput leukocyte phenotyping substantially advances opportunities for pathophysiological studies, personalized medicine, and drug testing applications."

These co-infections show higher antibiotic tolerance <i>in vitro</i> compared to mono-infections. <i>In vitro</i> models have been developed to study the interspecies interactions between <i>P. aeruginosa</i> and <i>S. aureus</i>. However, these model systems fail to incorporate clinical isolates with diverse phenotypes, do not reflect the nutritional environment of the CF airway mucus, and/or do not model the biofilm mode of growth observed in the CF airways. Here, we established a dual-species biofilm model grown in artificial sputum medium, where <i>S. aureus</i> was inoculated before <i>P. aeruginosa</i> to facilitate the maintenance of both species over time. It was successfully applied to ten pairs of clinical isolates exhibiting different phenotypes. Co-isolates from individual patients led to robust, stable co-cultures, supporting the theory of cross-adaptation <i>in vivo</i>. Investigation into the cross-adaptation of the VBB496 co-isolate pair revealed that both the <i>P. aeruginosa</i> and <i>S. aureus</i> isolates had reduced antagonism, in part due to reduced production of <i>P. aeruginosa</i> secondary metabolites as well as higher tolerance to those metabolites by <i>S. aureus</i>. Together, these results indicate that the two-species biofilm model system provides a useful tool for exploring interspecies interactions of <i>P. aeruginosa</i> and <i>S. aureus</i> in the context of CF airway infections."

    "abstract": "Bronchiectasis is the permanent enlargement of the bronchi following damage to the respiratory tract (bronchi) in the lungs. Bronchiectasis not associated with cystic fibrosis is gaining an increasing place among chronic respiratory diseases worldwide. The purpose of this study was to identify the levels of MMP-9, known to cause bronchial damage in chronic pulmonary illness, and SIRT-1, an anti-aging and anti-infective regulatory protein, in patients with bronchiectasis and to evaluate the importance of these biomarkers in diagnosis. This cross-sectional study was conducted in the Chest Diseases Clinic of Sivas Cumhuriyet University Medical Faculty Hospital between November 2020 and September 2022. We recruited 30 patients with bronchiectasis whose diagnosis was verified by high-resolution chest CT scan and 30 healthy controls. SIRT-1 and MMP-9 levels in the serum of the study group were determined by the ELISA method. SIRT-1 and MMP-9 concentrations were found to be statistically significant. In comparison to the control group, it was observed that the bronchiectasis group had a lower serum SIRT-1 levels (p<0.001). The bronchiectasis group had higher serum MMP-9 values than the control group (p<0.001). Age-related differences in SIRT-1 and MMP-9 concentrations were not observed. No correlation was found between MMP-9 and SIRT-1. The results of Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis indicated that MMP-9 has relatively high sensitivities. We concluded that, higher inflammation elevates MMP-9 levels while decreasing SIRT-1 levels. MMP-9 and SIRT-1 may be potential biomarkers in the diagnosis of bronchiectasis."

The environmental impact of a product is estimated by its carbon footprint (CF). Pressurized metered-dose inhalers (pMDIs) have a higher CF than dry powder inhalers (DPIs) and soft mist inhalers (SMIs) due to the incorporation of GHGs.

Retrospective determination (January 2018-December 2023) of consumption and CF (tCO<sub>2</sub>eq) by type of inhaler was conducted. Consumption and CF trends were evaluated using linear regression. Annually, 1.529 (1.279-1.613) pMDIs, 1.055 (855-1.333) DPIs, and 28 (20-42) SMIs were dispensed, representing 55.97%, 42.33%, and 1.70%, respectively. A statistically significant positive trend in the consumption of SMIs was observed.

This study examined the lung microbiome in two countries with differing antibiotic practices and its relationship to lung function in young children with CF. A binational, longitudinal, observational study was performed to define the lower airway microbiome in infants with CF. 16S rRNA sequencing was performed using lavage fluid to characterize the lung microbiota in 45 infants with and without prophylactic antibiotic therapy at an average age of approximately 3 months and 14 months. The association between pulmonary function, bacterial community diversities, and taxa was assessed. Expected CF bacterial genera and non-traditional bacteria, such as Streptococcus, were identified as core taxa. Microbial community shifts were observed in infants who received antibiotic prophylaxis, with lower alpha diversity (ANOVA, P < 0.05) and a higher proportion of Streptococcus at the first visit. Beta diversity (FEV<sub>0.5</sub>z; MiRKAT, P < 0.05) and Streptococcus were associated with FEV<sub>0.5</sub>z (LASSO and linear regression, β < 0). Functional annotation suggested that alteration of lung microbiota may be linked to antimicrobial resistance. Lung microbial diversity in infants with CF varied between the two countries, particularly during early infancy. A shift in the lung microbiome toward a higher relative abundance of Streptococcus was associated with reduced pulmonary function."

    "abstract": "People with cystic fibrosis (pwCF) are living longer and with an increased risk of malignancies, preventative cancer screening is crucial. The objectives of this study were to determine cancer screening rates for pwCF compared to the general population, and assess the impact of primary care provider (PCP) involvement on screening rates among those with CF. This population-based cohort study linked Canadian CF Registry data with health administrative databases. Four screening cohorts were identified: breast, cervical, colorectal pre-transplant, colorectal post-transplant. PCP involvement was defined using billing codes. Screening rates were calculated as the number screened divided by the number of person-years individuals were eligible for screening. Poisson regression was used to describe rates. In the CF cohort, 74/110 (67.3 %) were screened for breast cancer, and 321/541 (59.3 %) for cervical cancer. 186/402 (46.3 %) in the pre-transplant cohort were screened with colonoscopy and 75/148 (50.7 %) in the post-transplant cohort. Those with CF were significantly more likely to be screened for breast cancer (RR 3.39, 95 % CI 2.70-4.26) and colorectal cancer pre-transplant (RR 1.58, 95 % CI 1.37-1.82) compared to the non-CF cohort. Having a PCP increased the likelihood that pwCF received screening for breast cancer (RR 3.6, 95 % CI 1.13-11.44), cervical cancer (RR 1.71, 95 % CI 1.13-2.57), and colorectal cancer (pre-transplant population only) (RR 1.57, 95 % CI 1.06-2.32). Screening rates for cancers in CF remain suboptimal. These results highlight opportunities to improve screening uptake through better integration of PCP in CF care models and to increase awareness of cancer risk."

In most subgroups, ULTx was associated with worse outcomes, but no difference in OS was observed in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. ULTx reduces waiting list mortality in critical patients, but is associated with worse OS than standard LTx. ULTx may limit short-term survival rather than long-term survival compared with standard LTx."

    "abstract": "This study examines the impact of inhaled tobramycin therapy on the within-host changes in <i>P. aeruginosa</i> strains isolated from Bulgarian patients with CF prior to and post treatment. Genotypic comparison by RAPD-PCR indicated that most of the pre-treatment isolates had a high similarity and were genetically comparatively close to strains from other countries with known increased morbidity or treatment requirements. Most of the post-treatment isolates were, however, genetically distant from their pre-treatment counterparts, showing genotypic diversification after the treatment. Phenotypic comparisons showed a lower ODmax reached during groswth and an increased lag-time in the post-treatment isolates. All strains were capable of invasion and intracellular reproduction within A549 cultured cells. The addition of sub-inhibitory amounts (1/4 or 1/2 MIC) of tobramycin during growth showed the higher relative fitness (as a percentage of the untreated control) of the post-treatment strains. The effects of sub-MICs on biofilm growth did not show such a pronounced trend. However, when a resazurin-based viability test was applied, the advantage of the post-treatment strains was confirmed for both broth and biofilm cultures. In spite of that, according to the determined MIC values, all isolates were tobramycin-sensitive, and the data from this study imply the development of tolerance to the antibiotic in the strains that survived the treatment."

    "title": "The Effects of Progressive Muscle Relaxation on Mental Health and Sleep Quality in Adults with Cystic Fibrosis: A Randomized Controlled Trial.",
    "abstract": "<b>Background/Objective</b>: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a chronic genetic disease affecting multiple body systems and having a significant impact on mental health and sleep. Patients with CF frequently suffer from anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbances, but non-pharmacological strategies are understudied. Although progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) has recognized benefits, its impact on CF remains insufficiently explored. The study aimed to analyze the effect of integrating PMR into a standard pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) program on mental health, sleep quality, and quality of life in adults with CF. <b>Methods</b>: A total of 22 adult patients with CF were randomly assigned to either the intervention group (PR + PMR) or the control group (PR only). Assessments were performed at baseline, after 21 days of intervention, and at the 48-day follow-up. Outcome measures included the CFQ-R for quality of life, the HADS for mental health, and the PSQI for sleep. <b>Results</b>: Compared to the control group, participants who practiced PMR experienced significant reductions in anxiety (<i>p</i> = 0.05) and depression (<i>p</i> = 0.02) at the final assessment. A significant improvement in sleep quality was also observed (<i>p</i> < 0.01). No relevant differences were found in pulmonary function or performance on the six-minute walk test. <b>Conclusions</b>: Integrating PMR into pulmonary rehabilitation programs may be an effective strategy for improving mental health and sleep in patients with CF. Due to its accessibility and ease of implementation, PMR could be adopted as a complementary method in the holistic care of these patients."

    "title": "Exploration of Olfaction and ChiPSO in Pediatric Cystic Fibrosis.",
    "abstract": "<b>Background/Objectives</b>: Olfactory dysfunction (OD) is a common symptom among people with cystic fibrosis (PwCF) and contributes to environmental safety concerns, nutritional challenges, and an overall diminished quality of life. OD is perceived to progress along the lifespan in PwCF, often due to worsening sinonasal disease. Among children with cystic fibrosis (CwCF), OD is poorly characterized as limited resources and tolerance contribute to challenges in psychophysical olfactory evaluation among pediatric populations. The Children's Personal Significance of Olfaction (ChiPSO) questionnaire was recently proposed as a tool to assess olfaction and the importance of olfactory stimulation among children. This pilot study aimed to evaluate the utility of ChiPSO among a cohort of ethnically diverse CwCF. <b>Methods</b>: Individuals aged 7-17 with physician-diagnosed CF were asked to complete questionnaires, including ChiPSO and the brief questionnaire on olfactory dysfunction (bQOD-NS), prior to undergoing psychophysical olfactory evaluation with the U-Sniff Identification test. Potential associations between questionnaires and olfactory performance, pulmonary function, and demographic characteristics were evaluated using Pearson and Spearman correlations, independent-sample <i>t</i>-tests, Wilcoxon rank sum tests, and multiple linear regression. <b>Results</b>: U-Sniff Identification score positively correlated with the overall ChiPSO total score [<i>r</i>(13) = 0.640, <i>p</i> = 0.010] and its environmental subdomain score [<i>r</i>(13) = 0.774, <i>p</i> < 0.001], though not with the food subdomain [<i>r</i>(13) = 0.450, <i>p</i> = 0.093], the social subdomain [<i>r</i>(13) = 0.343, <i>p</i> = 0.2], or bQOD-NS score [<i>r</i>(11) = -0.125, <i>p</i> = 0.7]. Hispanic ethnicity is associated with ChiPSO (<i>p</i> = 0.041). <b>Conclusions</b>: In this preliminary study, olfactory importance increases with olfactory function among an ethnically diverse sample of CwCF, with a preferential influence of olfactory function on personal importance of environmental olfactory information. While these results should be interpreted with limitations imposed by the pilot nature of our sample size, our pilot data highlights associations with early adolescent development of importance of olfaction that can be disrupted in the setting of progressive disease among CwCF."

    "abstract": "<i>Background and Objectives:</i> In the present systematic review and meta-analysis, we aimed to discover the overall efficacy of azithromycin in children with cystic fibrosis (CF) and with or without <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> infection, specifically regarding its effect on respiratory parameters such as forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) in addition to its effect on exacerbations and the need to use additional antibiotics. <i>Materials and Method:</i> We conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis by searching for all eligible articles on PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus published between inception and September 2024. We used the following search strategy for our searching process: \"Cystic fibrosis\" AND \"Azithromycin\" and \"Children\" OR \"Pediatric\" OR \"Infant\". We conducted the meta-analysis by pooling the mean difference (MD) and comparing the continuous variables and odds ratio (OR) for dichotomous variables at 95% confidence intervals (CI), at a <i>p</i>-value of 0.05. <i>Results:</i> Azithromycin was observed to be associated with increased FEV1 compared with the control, showing an MD of 1.91 (95% CI: 1.09, 2.74, <i>p</i> < 0.00001) and non-significant heterogeneity. However, no significant difference was observed between azithromycin and control groups regarding FVC with MD = 0.62 (95% CI: -0.01, 1.25, <i>p</i> = 0.06). Compared with the control group, azithromycin was significantly associated with lower risk and a lower number of exacerbations, with OR = 0.48 (95% CI: 0.34, 0.67, <i>p</i> < 0.0001) and MD = -0.82 (95% CI: -1.32, -0.33, <i>p</i> = 0.001), respectively, with non-significant heterogeneity. Regarding the need for new antibiotic usage, azithromycin showed a significantly lower need, with OR = 0.35 (95% CI: 0.13, 0.94, <i>p</i> = 0.04), I<sup>2</sup> = 75%, <i>p</i> = 0.02. No significant difference was observed between both groups regarding hospitalization rate, with OR = 0.88 (95% CI: 0.55, 1.4, <i>p</i> = 0.59). <i>Conclusions:</i> This systematic review and meta-analysis showed the efficacy of azithromycin in pediatric patients with CF, as it improved lung function by increasing FEV1, reduced exacerbations of CF, which is the most common symptom of CF that leads to mortality, and reduced the number of antibiotics that needed to be administered to patients with CF, which reduces the risk of antibiotic resistance. Therefore, the long-term use of azithromycin is recommended for pediatric patients with CF as part of their treatment regimen."

    "abstract": "Psychosis, particularly schizophrenia (SZ), is influenced by genetic and environmental factors. The neurodevelopmental hypothesis suggests that genetic factors affect neuronal circuit connectivity during perinatal periods, hence causing the onset of the diseases. In this study, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in a sample of the first episode of psychosis (FEP). A sample of 147 individuals diagnosed with non-affective psychosis and 102 controls were recruited and assessed. After venous blood and DNA extraction, the samples were genotyped. Genetic data underwent quality controls, genotype imputation, and a case-control genome-wide association study (GWAS). After the GWAS, results were investigated using an in silico functional mapping and annotation approach. Our GWAS showed the association of 27 variants across 13 chromosomes at genome-wide significance (<i>p</i> < 1 × 10<sup>-7</sup>) and a total of 1976 candidate variants across 188 genes at suggestive significance (<i>p</i> < 1 × 10<sup>-5</sup>), mostly mapping in non-coding or intergenic regions. Gene-based tests reported the association of the SUFU (<i>p</i> = 4.8 × 10<sup>-7</sup>) and NCAN (<i>p</i> = 1.6 × 10<sup>-5</sup>) genes. Gene-sets enrichment analyses showed associations in the early stages of life, spanning from 12 to 24 post-conception weeks (<i>p</i> < 1.4 × 10<sup>-3</sup>) and in the late prenatal period (<i>p</i> = 1.4 × 10<sup>-3</sup>), in favor of the neurodevelopmental hypothesis. Moreover, several matches with the GWAS Catalog reported associations with strictly related traits, such as SZ, as well as with autism spectrum disorder, which shares some genetic overlap, and risk factors, such as neuroticism and alcohol dependence. The resulting genetic associations and the consequent functional analysis displayed common genetic liability between the non-affective psychosis, related traits, and risk factors. In sum, our investigation provided novel hints supporting the neurodevelopmental hypothesis in SZ and-in general-in non-affective psychoses."

    "abstract": "Cystic fibrosis (CF), a genetic disorder characterized by mutations in the CFTR gene, has seen significant advances in treatment through cutting-edge approaches such as gene therapy and personalized medicine. This review examines the current and emerging strategies shaping CF care, focusing on novel therapies that target the root cause of CF and optimize patient outcomes. CFTR modulators have transformed cystic fibrosis management by enhancing protein function for specific mutations, leading to improved lung function and quality of life. Concurrently, gene therapy offers transformative potential by aiming to correct CFTR mutations using tools like CRISPR/Cas9 or prime editing, though challenges remain in delivery and long-term efficacy. The integration of precision medicine, facilitated by genomic and computational technologies, allows for personalized treatment plans that account for genetic variability and disease severity. Complementing these approaches, holistic management emphasizes the importance of psychological support and nutritional optimization, acknowledging CF's multi-system impact. Future directions include exploring anti-inflammatory agents and microbiome modulation to further mitigate disease morbidity. However, global disparities in treatment access continue to challenge equitable healthcare delivery, underscoring the need for policy reform and international cooperation. By synthesizing these developments, this review highlights the transformative potential of modern CF treatments, advocating for continued innovation and global healthcare equity, with the ultimate goal of dramatically improving life expectancy and quality of life for individuals with CF."

    "abstract": "Pediatric gastroenterology is entering a pivotal phase marked by significant challenges and emerging opportunities in treating conditions like celiac disease (CeD), eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) pose significant clinical hurdles, but new therapeutic avenues are emerging. Advances in precision medicine, particularly proteomics, are reshaping care by tailoring treatments to individual patient characteristics. For CeD, therapies like gluten-degrading enzymes (latiglutenase, Kuma030) and zonulin inhibitors (larazotide acetate) show promise, though clinical outcomes are inconsistent. Immunotherapy and microbiota modulation, including probiotics and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), are also under exploration, with potential benefits in symptom management. Transglutaminase 2 inhibitors like ZED-1227 could help prevent gluten-induced damage. Monoclonal antibodies targeting immune pathways, such as AMG 714 and larazotide acetate, require further validation in pediatric populations. In EoE, biologics like dupilumab, cendakimab, dectrekumab (IL-13 inhibitors), and mepolizumab, reslizumab, and benralizumab (IL-5/IL-5R inhibitors) show varying efficacy, while thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) inhibitors like tezepelumab are also being investigated. These therapies require more pediatric-specific research to optimize their use. For IBD, biologics like vedolizumab, ustekinumab, and risankizumab, as well as small molecules like tofacitinib, etrasimod, and upadacitinib, are emerging treatments. New medications for individuals with refractory or steroid-dependent AIH have been explored. Personalized therapy, integrating precision medicine, therapeutic drug monitoring, and lifestyle changes, is increasingly guiding pediatric IBD management. This narrative review explores recent breakthroughs in treating CeD, EoE, IBD, and AIH, with a focus on pediatric studies when available, and discusses the growing role of proteomics in advancing personalized gastroenterological care."

    "abstract": "Until relatively recently, bronchiectasis (not due to cystic fibrosis) was considered an orphan disease, lacking clinical and commercial interest, and was rarely diagnosed. Since the 2000s, several working groups have emerged in Europe and the US - with the first register for bronchiectasis launching in Spain - and these have demonstrated the impact bronchiectasis has on health. Today, bronchiectasis is considered the third most common chronic inflammatory disease of the airways, after COPD and asthma, and represents a significant economic burden. We make the case for further characterization of these registries to better understand the heterogeneous epidemiology of bronchiectasis."

Given the geographical allocation change to the lung allocation score (LAS) in 2017 and the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in 2019, we aim to provide an updated analysis of the patient selection and outcomes of CLLTs. The UNOS registry was used to identify all patients who underwent CLLT between January 2014 and June 2023. To account for the changes made to LAS in 2017, baseline characteristics and outcomes were compared between era 1 (before 2017) and era 2 (after 2017). Risk factors for mortality were analyzed using the Cox regression hazard models. Recipient survival of up to 3 years was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. 117 CLLTs were performed (77.8% in era 2). Donor organs experienced significantly longer ischemic times (p = 0.039) and traveled longer distances (p = 0.025) in era 2. However, recipient (p = 0.79) and graft (p = 0.41) survival remained comparable at up to 3 years post-transplant between eras. CLLTs demonstrated similar long-term survival to isolated lung transplants (p = 0.73). Higher recipient LAS was associated with an increased mortality risk (HR 1.14, p = 0.034). Recipient diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis carried a 5.03-fold risk of mortality (p = 0.048) compared to those with cystic fibrosis. In the post-2017 LAS change era, CLLTs are increasingly performed with comparable outcomes to isolated lung transplants. A careful, multidisciplinary approach to patient selection and management remains paramount to optimizing outcomes for this rare patient population."

The median age for study group and control group participants was 31 years and 27 years, respectively. All participants completed a detailed questionnaire before undergoing a clinical examination that recorded demographic, social and oral health variables. Caries was recorded using the Decayed, Missing and Filled Teeth (DMFT) index. All data were statistically analysed using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, chi-squared test and Fisher's test. Negative binomial models were also used to analyse data.Results The study group had a higher mean DMFT score compared to the control group (6.52, 0.99, 0.41, 3.89 versus 5.33, 0.18, 0.11, 3.68). While the study group had a higher DMFT, the only component that was statistically significant between the groups was the Decayed Teeth component (p <0.001).Conclusion In this study, the cohort of people with cystic fibrosis had more caries than people without cystic fibrosis. Further research is required to establish if underlying systemic conditions, social and behavioural factors, or a combination of the aforementioned are responsible for a higher caries experience in this study group."

    "abstract": "This report highlights a clinical case of recurrent diffuse panbronchiolitis (DPB) after bilateral lung transplantation (LTx), with a focus on the therapeutic impact of off-label inhaled tobramycin solution for inhalation (TSI) in managing Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization. A Japanese woman with a history of DPB experienced disease recurrence following bilateral LTx. Persistent colonization by P. aeruginosa and recurrent respiratory symptoms were observed. Off-label TSI therapy, commonly used in cystic fibrosis, was introduced. Clinical response was assessed through radiologic imaging, bronchoscopy, and microbiological cultures. TSI administration led to significant clinical and radiological improvement. P. aeruginosa was eradicated from sputum cultures within one month and remained absent throughout six months of follow-up. No hospitalizations or adverse events were reported during therapy. This case suggests the potential of TSI as a therapeutic approach for managing recurrent DPB and indicates its role in stabilizing post-transplant outcomes. Further studies may clarify its efficacy and expand its application in broader DPB management strategies."

    "abstract": "Chronic lung infections caused by <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> and <i>Burkholderia cenocepacia</i> pose a severe threat to immunocompromised patients, particularly those with cystic fibrosis. These pathogens often infect the respiratory tract, and available treatments are limited due to antibiotic resistance. Targeting bacterial lectins involved in biofilm formation and host-pathogen interactions represents a promising therapeutic strategy. In this study, we evaluate the potential of synthetic fucosylamides as inhibitors of the two lectins LecB (<i>P. aeruginosa</i>) and BC2L-C-Nt (<i>B. cenocepacia</i>). Using a suite of biophysical assays, we assessed their binding affinities, identifying three β-fucosylamides as promising dual-target ligands, while crystallography studies revealed the atomic basis of these ligands to interact with both bacterial lectins. The emerged classes of compounds represent a solid starting point for the necessary hit-to-lead optimization for future dual inhibitors aiming at the treatment of coinfections with these two bacterial pathogens."

The adaptation influences virulence and complicates antibiotic treatment mainly for the antimicrobial resistance context. D- and L-AAs have been analyzed for their impact on quorum sensing (QS), a mechanism that regulates virulence factors. This research aimed to reconstruct the genome-scale metabolic model (GEM) of <i>P. aeruginosa</i> PAO1 to investigate the metabolic roles of D- and L-AAs in QS-related pathways. The updated GEM, iJD1249, was reconstructed by using protocols to integrate data from previous models and refined with well-standardized in silico media (LB, M9, and SCFM) to improve flux balance analysis accuracy. The model was used to explore the metabolic impact of D-Met, D-Ala, D-Glu, D-Ser, L-His, L-Glu, L-Arg, and L-Ornithine (L-Orn) at 5 and 50 mM in QS-related pathways, focusing on the effects on bacterial growth and carbon flux distributions. Among the tested AAs, D-Met was the only one that did not enhance the growth rate of <i>P. aeruginosa</i> PAO1, while L-Arg and L-Orn increased fluxes in the L-methionine biosynthesis pathway, influencing the <i>metH</i> gene. These findings suggest a differential metabolic role for D-and L-AAs in QS-related pathways. Our results shed some light on the metabolic impact of AAs on QS-related pathways and their potential role in <i>P. aeruginosa</i> virulence.

This ambispective observational analysis assessed lung CT scans performed before initiating ETI and after at least one year of treatment, using the modified Bhalla scoring system. For those patients with an earlier CT scan, a pre-treatment phase analysis was performed. Epidemiological, clinical, and functional parameters were evaluated. Results: Sixty-two patients were included (35 males, median age 30.4 ± 7.87 years).

In vitro models that emulate these properties are essential for understanding the impact of CF mucus on airway function and for the development of therapeutic strategies. This study characterizes a mucus mimic composed of xanthan gum and locust bean gum, which is designed to exhibit the rheological properties of CF mucus. Mucus concentrations ranging from 0.07% to 0.3% <i>w</i>/<i>v</i> were tested to simulate different states of bacterial infection in CF. Key rheological parameters, including yield stress, storage modulus, loss modulus, and viscosity, were measured using an HR2 rheometer with strain sweep, oscillation frequency, and flow ramp tests. The results show that increasing the concentration enhanced the mimic's elasticity and yield stress, with values aligning with those reported for CF mucus in pathological states. These findings provide a quantitative framework for tuning the rheological properties of mucus in vitro, allowing for the simulation of CF mucus across a range of concentrations. This mucus mimic is cost-effective, readily cross-linked, and provides a foundation for future studies examining the mechanobiological effects of mucus yield stress on epithelial cell layers, particularly in the context of bacterial infections and airway disease modeling."

    "abstract": "Joint models for longitudinal and survival data have become a popular framework for studying the association between repeatedly measured biomarkers and clinical events. Nevertheless, addressing complex survival data structures, especially handling both recurrent and competing event times within a single model, remains a challenge. This causes important information to be disregarded. Moreover, existing frameworks rely on a Gaussian distribution for continuous markers, which may be unsuitable for bounded biomarkers, resulting in biased estimates of associations. To address these limitations, we propose a Bayesian shared-parameter joint model that simultaneously accommodates multiple (possibly bounded) longitudinal markers, a recurrent event process, and competing risks. We use the beta distribution to model responses bounded within any interval <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"> <semantics><mrow><mo>(</mo> <mi>a</mi> <mo>,</mo> <mi>b</mi> <mo>)</mo></mrow> <annotation>$$ \\left(a,b\\right) $$</annotation></semantics> </math> without sacrificing the interpretability of the association. The model offers various forms of association, discontinuous risk intervals, and both gap and calendar timescales. A simulation study shows that it outperforms simpler joint models. We utilize the US Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Patient Registry to study the associations between changes in lung function and body mass index, and the risk of recurrent pulmonary exacerbations, while accounting for the competing risks of death and lung transplantation. Our efficient implementation allows fast fitting of the model despite its complexity and the large sample size from this patient registry. Our comprehensive approach provides new insights into cystic fibrosis disease progression by quantifying the relationship between the most important clinical markers and events more precisely than has been possible before. The model implementation is available in the R package JMbayes2."

Sonuç olarak, P.aeruginosa'nın KF hastalarında yüksek biyofilm oluşturma kapasitesine sahip olduğu belirlenirken antibiyotik tedavisinin mikroorganizmanın eradikasyonunda etkin rol oynamadığı saptanmıştır. Bu çalışma, ardışık izolatların biyofilm yapımı ve antibiyotik direnç paternlerinde anlamlı değişiklikler göstermediğini ortaya koymuştur. Benzer antibiyotik duyarlılık ve biyofilm yapımı gösteren ardışık P.aeruginosa izolatlarında bakterinin yok edilmesi için antibiyofilm duyarlılık testlerinin yapılması ve yeni antibiyofilm tedavi stratejilerinin geliştirilmesi önem arz etmektedir."

    "title": "Timing of lung transplant evaluation: considerations, barriers and alternatives.",
    "abstract": "Over the past decade, increased knowledge has contributed to improved medical and technical treatments across the spectrum of respiratory diseases. As a result, timing for transplant evaluation might be more challenging. In this review, the focus is on timing of lung transplant evaluation of patients from the main respiratory diseases referred. Disease-specific predictors of survival in relation to timing of transplant evaluation and alternative treatments will be reviewed. Treatment options have evolved for respiratory diseases like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary fibrosis, cystic fibrosis and pulmonary arterial hypertension. These treatments have led to improved quality of life, exercise tolerance, lung function and outcome. However, the effect of these alternative treatments on transplant candidacy and knowledge on timing of lung transplant evaluation are lacking. This article reviews the current best evidence to guide clinicians regarding the optimum timing for transplant referral and highlights considerations to optimize transplant candidacy and outcomes."

    "abstract": "This clinical overview reflects on a case of a nine-month-old boy presenting with mild bronchiolitis and persistently elevated transaminases. A total creatine kinase (CK) was requested to assess for dystrophinopathies, which was significantly elevated at 3000 U/L on repeat samples. Molecular testing confirmed the diagnosis of Becker's muscle dystrophy (BMD). During molecular testing, two cystic fibrosis (CF) mutations were incidentally detected, a p.Phe312del mutation and the classic CF-causing mutation p.Phe508del. Sweat chloride testing was repeatedly elevated in keeping with the diagnosis of CF. Despite the significantly elevated sweat chloride and molecular genetic profile showing heterozygosity for p.Phe508del and p.Phe312del mutations, the patient did not show any clinical manifestation of CF. During the newborn screening, immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT) was 26 ng/mL, below the upper limit value used for screening (54 ng/mL) at that time. This case illustrates two important points: firstly, patients heterozygous for p.Phe312del and p.Phe508del mutations may not be detected during newborn screening and may not have clinical manifestations of cystic fibrosis despite having unequivocally elevated sweat chloride. Secondly, an unexplained elevation of transaminases should trigger creatine kinase testing to check for dystrophinopathies."

Race-specific equations for spirometry may contribute by underestimating restriction severity in non-White candidates. We analyzed US lung transplant candidates to assess for disparities in forced vital capacity (FVC) at listing, comparing absolute and adjusted values using race-specific and race-neutral equations. We identified 17,457 adults with ILD listed May 4, 2005 to September 31, 2023. At listing, mean absolute FVC was higher for White patients (2.03 ± 0.80 liters) than Black patients (1.61 ± 0.67 liters) and Asian patients (1.49 ± 0.86 liters). Differences were attenuated after applying race-specific equations (White patients 50.0 ± 17.5%, Black patients 47.7 ± 17.9%, Asian patients 46.2 ± 24.2%). Compared with race-neutral equations, race-specific equations had higher odds of classifying FVC as severe (≤40%) requiring listing in White patients (OR 1.37, 95% CI 1.28-1.40) but lower odds in Black patients (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.74-0.90). Using race-neutral equations might help improve racial disparities for lung transplant candidates with ILD."

This clinical trial was a randomized, quasi-experimental pilot and add-on therapy controlled with a placebo for 3 months. The case group received 200 mg of oral NAC three times a day. In contrast, the control group had a placebo in the same way. From the 2021 fall to the summer of 2022, 38 CF patients referred to Imam Hossein Children's Hospital Clinic were finally examined. They were clinically stable with a forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) level of more than 50% and no history of underlying cardiovascular and renal diseases. The differences between the groups were not significant. In the placebo group, key measures remained unchanged, whereas the NAC group had an improvement in the CF Questionnaire-Revised score but no notable changes in other indices. Overall, comparisons of forced vital capacity (FVC) between the groups showed no variation. The indicators of FEV<sub>1</sub>, FVC, FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC, <i>forced expiratory flow between 25% and 75% of vital capacity</i>, and the quality of life of the case group were not significantly different from those of the placebo group, and no significant differences were observed between this medicine and placebo."

    "abstract": "Diabetes and bone disease are common in cystic fibrosis (CF) and primarily occur alongside exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (PI). \"Incretins,\" glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), augment insulin secretion and regulate bone metabolism. In CF, PI dampens the incretin response. Loss of the insulinotropic effect of GIP in CF was recently identified, but effects on bone are unknown. Determine effects of incretins on bone resorption markers in adults with PI-CF. Secondary analysis of a mechanistic double-blinded randomized placebo-controlled crossover trial including adults ages 18-40 years with PI-CF (n = 25). Adults with PI-CF received either GIP (4 pmol/kg/min) or GLP-1 (1.5 pmol/kg/min) infusion, followed by double-blind randomization to either incretin or placebo infusion. Non-CF healthy controls received double-blind GIP (4 pmol/kg/min) or placebo. Serum C-terminal telopeptide (CTX), a bone resorption marker, was assessed during the infusion over 80 (GIP) or 60 (GLP-1) minutes. CTX (mg/dL) concentrations. In PI-CF, CTX decreased during GIP infusion, but not during placebo (time-by-treatment interaction P < 0.01). GLP-1 did not affect CTX. In non-CF healthy controls, time-by-treatment interaction was not significant (P = 0.23), but CTX decreased during GIP (P = 0.02) but not placebo (P = 0.47). GIP evokes a bone anti-resorptive effect in people with PI-CF. Since the incretin response is perturbed in PI-CF, and an infusion of GIP lowers bone resorption, the \"gut-bone axis\" in CF-related bone disease requires attention."

    "abstract": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an inherited condition that leads to multiorgan dysfunction, especially in the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and reproductive tracts, with associated conditions including persistent pulmonary infection, liver disease, pancreatic insufficiency, and infertility. Historically, people with CF (pwCF) suffered a shortened lifespan due to complications of the condition, namely respiratory. The emphasis on center-based, multidisciplinary care and the widespread introduction of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulator therapy has resulted in pwCF living longer and healthier lives. Now they may encounter some of the health and social issues associated with growing older, which previously were not a typical experience for this population. In this article, we review relevant health issues for the aging CF population, including complications that arise from the condition itself, issues encountered due to treatment, and general conditions associated with aging that may manifest earlier or differently in pwCF. We discuss the recommendations for screening and treatment of relevant conditions, and considerations for the integration of healthcare professionals across disciplines into the care of this population."

    "abstract": "Innovation in cystic fibrosis (CF) supportive care, including implementing new antimicrobial agents, improved physiotherapy, and highly effective modulators therapy, has advanced patient survival into the 4th and 5th decades of life. However, even with these remarkable improvements in therapy, CF patients continue to suffer from pulmonary infection and other visceral organ complications associated with long-term deficient cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) expression. Human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been utilized in tissue engineering based upon their capacity to provide structural components of mesenchymal tissues. An alternative role of MSCs, however is their versatile utilization as cell-based infusion powerhouses due to the unique capacity to deliver milieu specific soluble biologic factors, promoting immune supportive antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory potency. MSCs derived from umbilical cord blood, bone marrow, adipose and other tissues can be expanded in ex vivo using good manufacturing procedure facilities for a safe, unique therapeutic to reduce and limit CF infection and facilitate the resolution of multi-organ inflammation. In our efforts, we conducted extensive preclinical development and validation of an allogeneic derived bone marrow derived MSC product in preparation for a clinical trial in CF. In this process, potency models were developed to ensure the functional capacity of the MSC product to provide clinical benefit. In vitro, murine in vivo and patient tissue ex vivo potency models were utilized to follow MSC anti-infective and anti-inflammatory potency associated with the CFTR deficient environment. We showed in our \"First in CF\" clinical trial that the allogeneic MSCs obtained from healthy volunteer bone marrow samples were safe. The advent of improved CF care measures and exciting new small molecules has changed the survival and morbidity phenotype of patients with CF, however, there are CF patients who cannot tolerate or have genotypes that are non-responsive to modulators. Additionally, even with the small molecule therapy, CF patients are living longer, but without genetic correction, with the CF disease manifestation aggravated by the continuance of pre-existing CFTR-associated clinical issues such as ongoing inflammation. MSCs secrete bio-active factors that enhance and protect tissue function and can promote \"self-immune\" regulation. These properties can provide therapeutic support for the traditional and changing face of CF disease clinical complications. Further, MSC-derived bio-active factors can directly mitigate colonizing pathogens' survival by producing antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) which change the pathogen surface and increase host recognition, elimination, and sensitivity to antibiotics. Herein, we review the potential of MSC therapeutics for treating many facets of CF, emphasizing the potential for providing great additive therapeutics for managing morbidity and quality of life."

    "abstract": "Lung transplantation (LTx) remains the ultimate treatment for many patients with advanced lung disease. Although the age cutoffs for LTx have been debated due to variable outcomes, the number of LTx procedures performed on patients aged ≥ 65 years has significantly increased in recent decades, reflecting the realities of an aging demographic. This trend underscores the unique management challenges faced by this cohort and highlights the importance of addressing evidence gaps in their perioperative and postoperative care. This literature review highlights that, despite the challenges, recent data indicate favorable outcomes for patients aged ≥ 65 years undergoing LTx. Although this article primarily focuses on postoperative care, it also addresses some perioperative considerations, including the use of extracorporeal life support as well as the choice of the procedure type and donor considerations. It additionally incorporates current knowledge about early and late postoperative complications, including neurologic, cardiovascular, and renal, among others, along with their management strategies and current practice patterns. In conclusion, this review emphasizes the need to optimize care for older LTx recipients. The evidence regarding ideal management practices for this population is limited. We highlight the necessity for comprehensive postoperative management guidelines and identify key areas for further research to establish evidence-based protocols for this growing demographic."

    "abstract": "Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) commonly occur in cystic fibrosis (CF) individuals with advanced disease, but their role in younger CF children is unknown. This study aimed to investigate clinical, functional, and radiological outcomes of CF children with early MRSA colonization. This retrospective cohort study compared CF individuals with MRSA isolation in cultures from respiratory secretions during the first 5 years of life (MRSA group) to age-matched controls. Data from the Brazilian CF Patient Registry and electronic medical records were used. Nutritional outcomes, lung function results between 6 and 7 years, and the first chest CT scan results were comparatively analysed. A linear regression model verified associations between MRSA identification before age 5 and potential confounders with lung function results. The MRSA group (n = 32) had greater oral antibiotic exposure but similar hospital admission rates compared to controls (n = 49). The proportion of cultures with methicillin-sensitive S. aureus was greater in the control group (48 % vs 29.4 %, p = 0.009). The MRSA group had lower FEV1 (80.02 % vs 92.51 %, p = 0.023) and higher bronchiectasis scores on chest CT scans (1.9 vs 0.38, p = 0.031). MRSA identification before age 5 was significantly associated with an average 10.1 % (95 %CI -19.518 to -0.586, p = 0.038) decrease of FEV1. Early MRSA identification was associated with increased exposure to antibiotics, higher bronchiectasis scores and lower FEV1 values at age 6. While these findings cannot define a relationship of causality, they provide insight into the associations between early MRSA infection and CF lung disease."

    "abstract": "<i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> (PA) is an opportunistic, frequently multidrug-resistant pathogen that can cause severe infections in hospitalized patients. Antibodies against the PA virulence factor, PcrV, protect from death and disease in a variety of animal models. However, clinical trials of PcrV-binding antibody-based products have thus far failed to demonstrate benefit. Prior candidates were derivations of antibodies identified using protein-immunized animal systems and required extensive engineering to optimize binding and/or reduce immunogenicity. Of note, PA infections are common in people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF), who are generally believed to mount normal adaptive immune responses. Here, we utilized a tetramer reagent to detect and isolate PcrV-specific B cells in pwCF and, via single-cell sorting and paired-chain sequencing, identified the B cell receptor (BCR) variable region sequences that confer PcrV-specificity. We derived multiple high affinity anti-PcrV monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from PcrV-specific B cells across three donors, including mAbs that exhibit potent anti-PA activity in a murine pneumonia model. This robust strategy for mAb discovery expands what is known about PA-specific B cells in pwCF and yields novel mAbs with potential for future clinical use."

In this context, planktonic, static, and dynamic biofilms and <i>in vivo</i> models of both species were optimized in this work to understand their population dynamics, disposition, virulence, and antibiotic susceptibility. From the coculture models optimized in this work, we determined that <i>B. cenocepacia</i> grows in a clustered, aggregative manner at the bottom layers of biofilms, in close contact with <i>P. aeruginosa</i>, that tends to occupy the top layers. Their coexistence increases virulence-related gene expression in both species at early stages of coinfection and in <i>in vivo</i> models, while there was a general downregulation of virulence-related genes after longer coexistence periods as they eventually reach a non-competitive stage during chronic infections. When evaluating antimicrobial susceptibility, a decrease of antimicrobial tolerance was observed in both species when co-cultured. These findings shed light on the differential behavior of <i>P. aeruginosa</i> and <i>B. cenocepacia</i> in dual-species systems, stressing the relevance of multispecies studies in the clinical context."

    "abstract": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive genetic disease caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) chloride channel. The first nucleotide-binding domain (NBD1) of the CFTR is considered to be a hotspot for CF-causing mutations, and some of these mutations compromise the domain's thermal stability as well as its interactions with other domains. The mechanisms by which such mutations exert their deleterious effects are important in the basic research of this complex disease as well as for the development of mutation-specific therapies. With this in mind, we studied two class-II, severe, CF-causing mutations, L467P and A559T, known to destabilize the domain by 19.3 and 10.7 °C, respectively, and to lead to a misfolded, nonfunctioning CFTR, by conducting microsecond-long molecular dynamics (MD) simulations at an elevated temperature of 410 K on L467P-NBD1 and A559T-NBD1 constructs. For comparison, similar simulations were also performed on the wild-type (WT) construct and on the 6SS-NBD1 and 2PT/M470V-NBD1 constructs, both bearing sets of stabilizing mutations that stabilize the domain by 17.5 and 8.2 °C, respectively. The resulting trajectories were analyzed using multiple metrics, leading to a good correlation between the experimental ΔTm values and the results of the simulations, as well as multiple experimental observations and results of previous modeling efforts. Specifically, our analyses point to specific regions within NBD1 that are substantially affected by the L467P and A559T mutations and, therefore, may play some role in their pathogenesis. Many of these regions are also known to be important for the proper folding and function of the full-length CFTR. Using time-dependent assignment of DSSP elements, we also found that the two mutants follow different disintegration pathways, that of L467P-NBD1 starting in region 464-471 which resides within the F1-like ATP-binding core subdomain and continues in regions 550-562 and 514-523 within the ABCα subdomain whereas that of A559T-NBD1 simultaneously starting at the 550-562 and 514-523 regions. We propose that the analyses presented in this work may pave the way toward the development of L467P and A559T-specific CF therapies and by extension to other mutation-specific therapies for CF and for other diseases involving mutations in NBDs of other proteins."

    "abstract": "Lung development begins during week 4 of pregnancy and continues through fetal development until early infancy. Various malformations can develop during the fetal period. There is histology overlap in several of them and partly joint etiology has been suggested as the cause of malformation. Early surgery has been supported after the diagnosis of a local pulmonary malformation due to potential malignancy risk and an increased lung infection risk. However, the evidence supporting surgery for asymptomatic patients is scarce. This comprehensive single-center study in a tertiary children's hospital included all 45 surgically treated patients at any age between 1986 and 2015. The study population consisted of 45 patients. Histology, preoperative symptoms, and radiological and operative findings were systematically reevaluated. Small cyst type congenital pulmonary airway malformation (CPAM) was the most common type of detected congenital lung malformation. There were no malignant or premalignant findings. Of all the patients, 23 (48.9%) were asymptomatic at the time of surgery. However, histology showed that four out of them (18%) had ongoing inflammation. Overall, one third of patients (n = 15, 34%) presented to have inflammation histologically. While chronic inflammation results in alveolar fibrosis, a high reported inflammation rate (34%) supports early malformation excision, regardless of the symptoms."

Patients with CF are hypersusceptible to Mycobacterium abscessus infection, a fast-growing mycobacterium and harmful opportunistic pathogen. Although CFTR dysfunction is known as a host susceptibility factor for M. abscessus infection, the functional impact of the trimeric Epithelial sodium Channel (ENaC), whose activity is negatively regulated by CFTR, towards M. abscessus infection has not been explored yet. To address this issue, we took advantage of miR-263a deficient Drosophila presenting a CF-like phenotype due to ENaC hyperactivity (ENaC+ ). We observed that the ENaC+ flies were as hypersusceptible to M. abscessus infection as the Cftr-deficient flies. The hypersensitivity of ENaC+ flies to M. abscessus infection was fully rescued by blocking ENaC hyperactivity, both chemically and genetically. Furthermore, we observed that ENaC hyperactivity per se was detrimental to ENaC+ Drosophila, as they were unable to mount an efficient humoral immune response. Upon infection, ENaC+ flies failed to upregulate 20-hydroxyecdysone production, which subsequently altered the production of protective antimicrobial peptides against M. abscessus. Overall, our results show that ENaC plays a key role in host susceptibility to M. abscessus infection and, correlatively to other CF pathogens."

Quantitative CT (QCT) scan textures of the lung can capture local disease patterns of inflammation and related respiratory morbidity. Are BVB textures, obtained from the adaptive multiple feature method, associated with systemic inflammation, morbidity, and mortality in COPD? We analyzed data from the Subpopulations and Intermediate Outcome Measures in COPD Study (SPIROMICS; n = 2,981) and the Genetic Epidemiology of COPD (COPDGene) study (n = 10,305). The predictors included 2 QCT scan biomarkers, the BVB and CT scan density gradient (CTDG) textures, age, sex, BMI, race, smoking status, pack-years of smoking, CT scan emphysema, and square root of the wall area of a hypothetical airway with a 10-mm lumen perimeter (Pi10). Outcomes included plasma biomarker concentrations from Meso Scale Discovery proteomics assays and CBC counts, both as markers of inflammation, along with FEV<sub>1</sub>, FEV<sub>1</sub> to FVC ratio, St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire score, 6-minute walk distance (6MWD), and modified Medical Research Council dyspnea scale score. Associations of these QCT scan textures with FEV<sub>1</sub> decline and all-cause mortality also were investigated. Increased BVB texture was associated significantly with elevated neutrophil and monocyte counts and the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), independent of clinical covariates, CT scan emphysema, and Pi10. Elevated CTDG was associated with increased neutrophil count, NLR, and tumor necrosis factor α. Increased CTDG and BVB textures also were associated with a lower FEV<sub>1</sub> and 6MWD. CTDG at baseline also was associated with decline in FEV<sub>1</sub> at the 5-year follow-up in the COPDGene study. We observed a significant association of both BVB texture (SPIROMICS: hazard ratio [HR], 1.084 [95% CI, 1.035-1.135; P < .001]; COPDGene: HR, 1.106 [95% CI, 1.080-1.131; P < .001]) and CTDG texture (SPIROMICS: HR, 1.033 [95% CI, 1.003-1.064; P = .03]; COPDGene: HR, 1.079 [95% CI, 1.061-1.096; P < .001]) with all-cause mortality independent of CT scan emphysema and Pi10.

Brensocatib, an oral, reversible inhibitor of dipeptidyl peptidase 1 (DPP-1), targets neutrophil serine proteases, key mediators of neutrophilic inflammation. In a phase 3, double-blind trial, we randomly assigned patients with bronchiectasis (in a 1:1:1 ratio for adults and a 2:2:1 ratio for adolescents) to receive brensocatib (10 mg or 25 mg once per day) or placebo. The primary end point was the annualized rate of adjudicated pulmonary exacerbations over a 52-week period.

In each brensocatib group, 48.5% of patients remained exacerbation-free at week 52, as compared with 40.3% in the placebo group (rate ratio, 1.20 [95% CI, 1.06 to 1.37; adjusted P = 0.02] with the 10-mg dose and 1.18 [95% CI, 1.04 to 1.34; adjusted P = 0.04] with the 25-mg dose). At week 52, FEV<sub>1</sub> had declined by 50 ml with the 10-mg dose, 24 ml with the 25-mg dose, and 62 ml with placebo (least-squares mean difference vs. placebo, 11 ml [95% CI, -14 to 37; adjusted P = 0.38] with the 10-mg dose and 38 ml [95% CI, 11 to 65; adjusted P = 0.04] with the 25-mg dose). The incidence of adverse events was similar across groups, except for a higher incidence of hyperkeratosis with brensocatib. Among patients with bronchiectasis, once-daily treatment with brensocatib (10 mg or 25 mg) led to a lower annualized rate of pulmonary exacerbations than placebo, and the decline in FEV<sub>1</sub> was less with the 25-mg dose of brensocatib than with placebo.

    "abstract": "New 2023 CF liver disease (CFLD) guidelines advocate for additional screening in people with cystic fibrosis (PwCF), including biennial abdominal ultrasound. As a first step towards effective and equitable guidelines implementation, we examined our current practice of CFLD screening and hepatobiliary involvement (HBI) evaluation. We identified characteristics of PwCF at-risk for incomplete screening and factors affecting evaluation. We retrospectively reviewed medical records of PwCF aged 0-21 years, with native liver and ≥ 2 outpatient CF clinic visits 2017-2023. Logistic regression was used to identify characteristics associated with incomplete screening and with HBI. Amongst 112 PwCF at our center: 37% (n = 42) self-reported as mixed race, 27% (n = 30) as Hispanic; 53% (n = 59) had public insurance. Incomplete lab screening was identified in 19% of our cohort. GGT was the most frequently missed component (14%, n = 16). Hispanics and publicly insured people were more likely to have incomplete screening. Of the 112, 45 met criteria for HBI. Demographics did not predict HBI. Five with CF and HBI had the full hepatitis workup recommended by the new guidelines. Those with HBI documented (42%, n = 19) were more likely to receive additional workup. PwCF who were seen by a gastroenterologist were more likely to have additional diagnostic work-up for HBI. One in five PwCF at our center were incompletely screened for CFLD, with Hispanics and publicly insured at higher risk. Accurate diagnosis and adequate documentation are the first steps to identifying HBI in PwCF. A dedicated CF gastroenterologist is key to completing CFLD screening and liver diagnosis."

    "abstract": "Because a delayed diagnosis of cystic fibrosis (CF) is detrimental and may be fatal, screening at birth has become routine in the Western world and has proven beneficial for many reasons, in addition to enabling prompt specialized care. Newborn screening (NBS) programs have elucidated the true incidence of CF in a variety of populations and enabled rapid genotype identification through the analysis of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (<i>CFTR</i>) gene. NBS studies also have revealed regional and population differences in <i>CFTR</i> variants and refuted the dogma that CF is a \"white person's disease\". But some regions have not yet implemented CF NBS, particularly in Asia where the disease prevalence has been uncertain. While the needs of a few low-and-middle-income countries are being addressed sequentially, one of the regions of greatest current interest is the Indian subcontinent because of recent data suggesting a higher incidence than that previously assumed, and clinical observations indicating tragic outcomes due to delayed diagnoses or failure to diagnose the disorder in young children. Thus, we conclude that the opportunities for research combined with service in the Indian subcontinent are urgent and potentially very impactful. Consequently, India is the <i>last and best frontier</i> for CF NBS, as we argue herein."

Systematic reviews were used to develop seven recommendations for newborn screening program practices to improve timeliness, sensitivity, and equity in diagnosing infants with CF: (1) The CF Foundation recommends the use of a floating immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT) cutoff over a fixed IRT cutoff; (2) The CF Foundation recommends using a very high IRT referral strategy in CF newborn screening programs whose variant panel does not include all CF-causing variants in CFTR2 or does not have a variant panel that achieves at least 95% sensitivity in all ancestral groups within the state; (3) The CF Foundation recommends that CF newborn screening algorithms should not limit <i>CFTR</i> variant detection to the F508del variant or variants included in the American College of Medical Genetics-23 panel; (4) The CF Foundation recommends that CF newborn screening programs screen for all CF-causing <i>CFTR</i> variants in CFTR2; (5) The CF Foundation recommends conducting <i>CFTR</i> variant screening twice weekly or more frequently as resources allow; (6) The CF Foundation recommends the inclusion of a <i>CFTR</i> sequencing tier following IRT and <i>CFTR</i> variant panel testing to improve the specificity and positive predictive value of CF newborn screening; (7) The CF Foundation recommends that both the primary care provider and the CF specialist be notified of abnormal newborn screening results. Through implementation, it is anticipated that these recommendations will result in improved sensitivity, equity, and timeliness of CF newborn screening, leading to improved health outcomes for all individuals diagnosed with CF following newborn screening and a decreased burden on families."

    "abstract": "Cystic fibrosis hepato-biliary involvement (CFHBI) is a common comorbidity in patients with CF and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The effect of the new and highly potent CF transmembrane conductance regulator modulator therapy, elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor (ETI), on CFHBI, is still unclear. This study aimed to investigate the impact of ETI on liver stiffness in children with CF, as measured using two-dimensional (2D) shear wave elastography (SWE). Twenty-one children with CF were included in this retrospective study at the CF centre, Skåne University Hospital, Lund, Sweden. Twelve children of our cohort had CFHBI; none had advanced CF liver disease. 2D SWE data from annual assessments, clinical data and liver enzymes were analysed. We found a significant reduction in liver stiffness after starting treatment with ETI in the total cohort. This reduction in liver stiffness could even be seen in children with CFHBI. Liver enzymes were within the normal range in both pre- and post-ETI therapy in the total cohort. In children with CFHBI, a decline in aspartate aminotransferase activity was observed after ETI was initiated. Lung function and lung clearance index improved significantly after ETI treatment commenced. ETI treatment could positively affect CFHBI in children with CF, as demonstrated by reduced liver stiffness during treatment."

    "abstract": "The rapid advancement of mRNA therapeutics, exemplified by COVID-19 vaccines, underscores the transformative potential of non-viral delivery systems. However, achieving efficient and targeted mRNA delivery to the lungs remains a critical challenge due to biological barriers such as pulmonary mucus, nanoparticle instability, and off-target accumulation particularly in the liver. Addressing these challenges is crucial for advancing treatments for respiratory diseases, including cystic fibrosis, primary ciliary dyskinesia, and lung cancers. This review highlights emerging strategies to enhance lung-targeted mRNA delivery, focusing on lipid nanoparticles, polymeric nanoparticles, lipid-polymer hybrids, and peptide/protein conjugates. By discussing advances in bioinspired design and nanoparticle reformulation, this review provides a roadmap for overcoming current delivery limitations and accelerating the clinical translation of lung-targeted mRNA therapies."

    "abstract": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a lethal genetic disorder caused by variants in CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). Many variants are treatable with correctors, which enhance the folding and trafficking of CFTR. However, approximately 3% of persons with CF harbor poorly responsive variants. Here, we used affinity purification mass spectrometry proteomics to profile the protein homeostasis (proteostasis) changes of CFTR variants during correction to assess modulated interactions with protein folding and maturation pathways. Responsive variant interactions converged on similar proteostasis pathways during correction. In contrast, poorly responsive variants subtly diverged, revealing a partial restoration of protein quality control surveillance and partial correction. Computational structural modeling showed that corrector VX-445 failed to confer enough NBD1 stability to poor responders. NBD1 secondary stabilizing mutations rescued poorly responsive variants, revealing structural vulnerabilities in NBD1 required for treating poor responders. Our study provides a framework for discerning the underlying protein quality control and structural defects of CFTR variants not reached with existing drugs to expand therapeutics to all susceptible CFTR variants."

    "abstract": "Pf bacteriophages, lysogenic viruses that infect Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa), are implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic Pa infections; phage-infected (Pf+) strains are known to predominate in people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF) who are older and have more severe disease. However, the transmission patterns of Pf underlying the progressive dominance of Pf+ strains are unclear. In particular, it is unknown whether phage transmission commonly occurs horizontally between bacteria via viral particles within the airway or whether Pf+ bacteria are mostly acquired via de novo Pseudomonas infections. Here, we studied Pa genomic sequences from 3 patient cohorts totaling 662 clinical isolates from 105 pwCF. We identified Pf+ isolates and analyzed transmission patterns of Pf within patients between genetically similar groups of bacteria called \"clone types.\" We found that Pf was predominantly passed down vertically within Pa clone types and rarely via horizontal transfer between clone types within the airway. Conversely, we found extensive evidence of Pa de novo infection by a new, genetically distinct Pf+ Pa. Finally, we observed that clinical isolates showed reduced activity of type IV pili and reduced susceptibility to Pf in vitro. These results cast light on the transmission of virulence-associated phages in the clinical setting."

    "abstract": "Pharmacological rescue of F508del-CFTR by the triple combination CFTR modulator therapy elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI) leads to unprecedented clinical benefits in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). However, previous studies in CF primary human airway epithelial cultures demonstrated that chronic treatment with the potentiator ivacaftor can render the F508del protein unstable, thus limiting restoration of CFTR chloride channel function. Even so, quantitative studies of this unwanted effect of ivacaftor on F508del channel function with dependency on cell culture conditions remain limited, and the impact of chronic ivacaftor exposure on restoration of mucociliary clearance that is impaired in patients with CF has not been studied. In patient-derived primary nasal epithelial cultures, we found that different culture conditions (UNC-ALI medium vs. PneumaCult medium) have profound effects on ETI-mediated restoration of F508del-CFTR function. Chronic treatment with ivacaftor as part of ETI triple therapy limited the rescue of F508del-CFTR chloride channel function when CF nasal epithelial cultures were grown in UNC-ALI medium but not in PneumaCult medium. In PneumaCult medium, both chronic and acute addition of ivacaftor as part of ETI treatment led to constitutive CFTR-mediated chloride secretion in the absence of exogenous cAMP-dependent stimulation. This constitutive CFTR-mediated chloride secretion was essential to improve viscoelastic properties of the mucus layer and to restore mucociliary transport on CF nasal epithelial cultures. Furthermore, nasal potential difference measurements in patients with CF showed that ETI restored constitutive F508del-CFTR activity in vivo. These results demonstrate that ivacaftor as a component of ETI therapy is essential to restore mucociliary clearance and suggest that this effect is facilitated by its constitutive activation of F508del channels following their folding correction in patients with CF."

Subjects aged 6-18 years with a genetic diagnosis of CF were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. After collecting demographic, anthropometric, and clinical data the following tests were performed: pulmonary function (spirometry), aerobic fitness (CPET), STS, and isometric quadriceps muscle strength (hand-held dynamometry). Data collection was performed on the same day. The study sample comprised 17 children (9.8 ± 1.6 years) and adolescents (13.7 ± 1.5 years) with a mean forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) of - 0.80 ± 1.61 (z-score). In the CPET, peak exercise oxygen consumption (VO<sub>2</sub>peak) was 35.1 ± 4.2 mL.kg<sup>-1</sup>.min<sup>-1</sup>, while in the STS mean number of repetitions was 32.5 ± 6.2 and total work (repetitions × body mass) was 1326.9 ± 379.6. At peak exercise, CPET elicited higher heart rate (<i>p</i> = .001) and subjective sensation of dyspnea (<i>p</i> = .001) compared to STS, though no significant differences were observed in peripheral oxygen saturation. Moderate and significant correlations were identified between total workload (CPET) and repetitions adjusted for body weight (<i>r</i> = 0.684; <i>p</i> = .002) and between STS repetitions and muscle strength corrected for body weight (<i>r</i> = 0.531; <i>p</i> = .034). No significant correlations were found with nutritional status (BMI), pulmonary function (FEV<sub>1</sub>), or other aerobic fitness variables (VO<sub>2</sub> at ventilatory threshold or VO<sub>2</sub>peak). In children and adolescents with CF, compared to CPET, the STS test elicits a submaximal cardiorespiratory response that is mostly dependent on quadriceps muscle strength."

    "abstract": "The prevalence of attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms among individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF) is significantly elevated compared to the general population. Given that the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is the causative gene for cystic fibrosis, this raises the possibility of CFTR playing a crucial role in ADHD. In our study, three heterozygous missense variants (p.E217G, p.F316L, and p.T1220I) were detected in the CFTR gene, which co-segregate with ADHD in two consanguineous families, impacting a total of six family members. Through the utilization of a zebrafish model, it was observed that the cftr knockout line exhibited behaviors akin to hyperactivity, impulsivity, and attention deficits, mirroring the symptoms seen in human ADHD patients. Single-cell RNA sequencing performed on 7 dpf larvae revealed clusters of neuron cells that exhibited sensitivity to cftr, particularly noting a reduction in the number of dopaminergic neuron cells within the cftr mutant fish. Additionally, bulk RNA sequencing and proteomic analysis conducted during the early gastrulation stage demonstrated abnormal expression levels of nervous system genes. Notably, we attempted to employ CFTR modulators Lumacaftor (VX-809) and Ivacaftor (VX-770) to ameliorate the ADHD zebrafish model (generated via per1b mutant), and it was found that enhanced CFTR activity could mitigate ADHD-like behaviors. In summary, our findings shed light on the potential involvement of CFTR in the pathogenesis of ADHD and pave the way for exploring novel diagnostic approaches and therapeutic strategies for ADHD by targeting CFTR."

    "title": "Decoding the role of extracellular vesicles in pathogenesis of cystic fibrosis.",
    "abstract": "Intercellular communication is a critical process that ensures cooperation between distinct cell types and maintains homeostasis. In the past decades, extracellular vesicles (EVs) have been recognized as key components in cell-to-cell communication. These EVs carry multiple factors such as active enzymes, metabolites, nucleic acids and surface molecules that can alter the behavior of recipient cells. Thus, the role of EVs in exacerbating disease pathology by transporting inflammatory mediators, and other molecular signals that contribute to chronic inflammation and immune dysregulation in various diseases including cystic fibrosis (CF) is well documented. CF is a genetic disorder characterized by chronic inflammation and persistent infections, primarily affecting the respiratory system. This review explores the multifaceted roles of EVs in CF lung disease, focusing on their biogenesis, cargo, and contributions to disease progression. It is well known that CF results from mutations in the CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) gene, leading to defective ion transport, thick mucus secretion, and a propensity for bacterial infections. However, it has been observed that EVs derived from CF patients carry altered molecular cargo, including proteins, lipids, RNA, and DNA, which can exacerbate these conditions by promoting inflammation, and modulating immune responses. Beyond their pathogenic roles, EVs also hold significant therapeutic potential. Their natural ability to transfer bioactive molecules positions them as promising vectors for delivering therapeutic agents, such as gene therapy constructs and anti-inflammatory compounds. Accordingly, a study has shown that these EVs can act as a carrier molecule for transport of functional CFTR mRNA, helping to restore proper chloride ion channel function by correcting defective CFTR proteins in affected cells. This review aims to summarize the role of EVs and their molecular cargo in pathogenesis of CF lung disease via modulation of intracellular signaling leading to persistent inflammation and increased disease severity. We also explored the mechanisms of EV biogenesis, cargo selection, and their effects on recipient cells which may provide novel insights into CF pathogenesis and open new avenues for EV-based therapies aimed at improving disease management."

Despite existing guidelines, significant gaps remain in asthma management during pregnancy, notably for women with moderate-to-severe asthma. This study aimed to explore the awareness, limitations, and challenges of asthma management during childbearing age and pregnancy from both asthmatic women (AW) and physician perspectives in Italy. Additionally, it sought to identify unmet needs and collect real-life experiences from Italian centers specialized in severe asthma care. An anonymous online survey was disseminated through scientific networks and patient associations. Separate questionnaires were developed for doctors and AW by a task force of specialists. 76 doctors and 54 AW completed the survey, with 70% of AW reporting moderate-to-severe asthma. While most physicians had experience managing asthma in pregnancy, 40% lacked systematic collaboration with gynecologists recognizing the need for integrated care. Despite guidelines supporting asthma medication continuity, 60% of doctors reported discontinuing treatments due to perceived risks. However, surveyed AW generally expressed greater confidence in medication safety. Physicians and AW highlighted the lack of pre-pregnancy counseling, with 55% of AW reporting they had never discussed pregnancy plans when starting asthma treatment. Both groups emphasized the need for improved interdisciplinary collaboration and structured asthma care pathways during pregnancy. This study reveals significant gaps in asthma management for women of childbearing age and during pregnancy, especially those with moderate-to-severe asthma. Improving outcomes requires better education for patients and healthcare providers, along with a structured multidisciplinary network."

This obstruction arises from external compression caused by one or more impacted gallstones, most often lodged in Hartmann's pouch, a segment of the gallbladder located near the cystic duct. The prolonged presence of these gallstones can lead to localized inflammation, fibrosis, and scarring, further exacerbating the narrowing of the bile ducts. This condition often presents with symptoms resembling other biliary disorders, making its diagnosis challenging. This report presents a rare case of Mirizzi syndrome Type I in a 64-year-old male patient. The patient was admitted with complaints of right upper quadrant pain for the past two days, radiating to the back, epigastric region, and left hypochondrium. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation, including magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), confirmed the diagnosis of Mirizzi syndrome Type I.

Our objectives were to identify the most-reported structural models and retained covariates and to compare the dosing regimens used in clinical routine with those recommended in literature and guidelines. A literature search was done through the PubMed database from inception to August 2024. Studies were retained only if they complied with the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The review included 21 popPK models covering the pharmacokinetic profiles of eight different molecules. Among these, five are recommended antibiotics for treating pulmonary infections in patients with cystic fibrosis. All models incorporated body composition and/or renal function measures as covariates in their pharmacokinetic parameter equations. Standard dosing regimens in the studies were consistent with guidelines and literature recommendations. This is the first review summarizing and describing all anti-infective popPK models in pediatric patients with cystic fibrosis. Improved estimation of pharmacokinetic parameters and a clearer understanding of variability sources will enhance the optimization of antibiotic treatment in clinical practice. Finally, the impact of new targeted therapies on the management of this population will have to be closely monitored in the years ahead."

Recent studies have suggested that although pancreatic insufficiency is an important explanation for CFRD development, inherent pancreatic islet cell dysfunction may play a role. This study aimed to systematically compile current data regarding the impact of pancreatic islet cell dysfunction on the development of CFRD. A systematic search was conducted in PubMed and Embase. The resulting articles were screened for relevant experimental design and outcomes. Articles underwent data extraction and quality assessment before compilation and analysis of the results. A total of 268 articles were initially screened and 19 studies conducted between 2006-2022 were finally included in this review. Half of the studies in human tissue and most of the studies in animal tissue could detect CFTR in the islets. Similarly, half of the publications in human islets and most studies in animal islets detect decreased insulin secretion with inhibition/mutation of CFTR. The literature on the role of islet CFTR is contradictory. However, a pattern emerges where CFTR loss-of-function mutations have the potential to negatively affect islet cell function in a way that, together with previously described exocrine damage occurring in CF, could play a part in the development of CFRD."

    "abstract": "Disease tolerance mitigates organ damage from non-resolving inflammation during persistent infections, yet its underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here we show, in a Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia mouse model, that disease tolerance depends on the mitochondrial metabolite itaconate, which mediates cooperative host-pathogen interactions. In P. aeruginosa, itaconate modifies key cysteine residues in TCA cycle enzymes critical for succinate metabolism, inducing bioenergetic stress and promoting the formation biofilms that are less immunostimulatory and allow the bacteria to integrate into the local microbiome. Itaconate incorporates into the central metabolism of the biofilm, driving exopolysaccharide production-particularly alginate-which amplifies airway itaconate signaling. This itaconate-alginate interplay limits host immunopathology by enabling pulmonary glutamine assimilation, activating glutaminolysis, and thereby restrain detrimental inflammation caused by the inflammasome. Clinical sample analysis reveals that P. aeruginosa adapts to this metabolic environment through compensatory mutations in the anti-sigma-factor mucA, which restore the succinate-driven bioenergetics and disrupt the metabolic synchrony essential for sustaining disease tolerance."

    "abstract": "Major progress has been made in elucidating the molecular, cellular, and supracellular mechanisms underlying aging. This has spurred the birth of geroscience, which aims to identify actionable hallmarks of aging. Aging can be viewed as a process that is promoted by overactivation of gerogenes, i.e., genes and molecular pathways that favor biological aging, and alternatively slowed down by gerosuppressors, much as cancers are caused by the activation of oncogenes and prevented by tumor suppressors. Such gerogenes and gerosuppressors are often associated with age-related diseases in human population studies but also offer targets for modeling age-related diseases in animal models and treating or preventing such diseases in humans. Gerogenes and gerosuppressors interact with environmental, behavioral, and psychological risk factors to determine the heterogeneous trajectory of biological aging and disease manifestation. New molecular profiling technologies enable the characterization of gerogenic and gerosuppressive pathways, which serve as biomarkers of aging, hence inaugurating the era of precision geromedicine. It is anticipated that, pending results from randomized clinical trials and regulatory approval, gerotherapeutics will be tailored to each person based on their genetic profile, high-dimensional omics-based biomarkers of aging, clinical and digital biomarkers of aging, psychosocial profile, and past or present exposures."

Ingested materials can result in SBO when individual or accumulated contents are too large to pass, such as in the case of foreign bodies or bezoars. Bowel stasis causing SBO can be secondary to abnormal bowel function, such as in cystic fibrosis, reduced transit of contents at sites of narrowing such as surgical anastomoses, or the formation of enteroliths in diverticula which may subsequently dislodge and result in luminal obstruction. Inflammatory causes of SBO include strictures or fistulas that allow foreign bodies (such as gallstones) formed outside the bowel to enter the bowel lumen and cause obstruction. Finally, neoplasms can present as endophytic masses that occlude the bowel lumen through a ball-valve mechanism or serve as a lead point for intussusception. Recognizing the imaging features that are suggestive of intraluminal SBO is critical for accurate diagnosis and timely patient care."

    "abstract": "The study investigates therapeutic strategies for managing chronic Mycobacterium abscessus infections, particularly in people with cystic fibrosis (PWCF) who are ineligible for standard elexacaftor, tezacaftor, ivakaftor (ETI) treatments. Apoptotic body-like liposomes loaded with phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate (ABL/PI5P) were tested in vitro in M. abscessus-infected macrophages from PWCF as potential treatment. ABL/PI5P reduced intracellular bacterial viability and showed enhanced effects on a M. abscessus clinical strain when combined with amikacin. Notably, ABL/PI5P was effective on macrophages from PWCF not receiving ETI therapy. The findings suggest ABL/PI5P liposomes as a promising alternative or adjunct therapy, especially for those who cannot access ETI treatment, warranting further clinical investigation."

    "title": "Prevalence of CFTR Pathogenic Variants in Pancreatitis: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.",
    "abstract": "Pathogenic variants (PVs) in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene are commonly reported across the spectrum of pancreatitis, including acute (AP), recurrent acute (RAP), and chronic pancreatitis (CP). We aimed to define the pooled prevalence of CFTR PVs according to pancreatitis phenotype. A systematic search using synonyms for \"CFTR\" and \"pancreatitis\" was performed in Embase and Pubmed databases. The primary outcome was the frequency of subjects with at least one CFTR PV amongst those who underwent germline CFTR testing. Subgroup analyses included age, pancreatitis etiology, and genetic testing strategy. Confidence intervals (CIs) were obtained using the exact binomial method (Clopper-Pearson), and a Sidik-Jonkman random effects model was used to calculate pooled prevalence. In total, 138 studies were included in the final analysis; 17 (n=1,873) reported populations with AP, 21 (n=1,172) with RAP, 86 (n=13,428) with CP, and 36 (n=4,521) with unspecified pancreatitis type. The pooled prevalence of at least one CFTR PV was 8.0% (95% CI: 4.3 - 14.4%) of AP, 16.4% (95% CI: 10.2 - 25.4%) of RAP, 15.3% (95% CI: 12.2 - 19.0%) of CP, and 25.0% (95% CI: 17.5 - 34.3%) of unspecified pancreatitis. Heterogeneity was high in each phenotype (I2 value range 88.3% to 96.7%). These findings underscore the complex landscape of CFTR PVs in pancreatitis, emphasizing the importance of tailored approaches in addressing this genetic component across diverse patient groups and phenotypic presentations. Additionally, these data are useful for pre-test genetic counseling, and provide a justification for developing CFTR-directed interventions."

    "abstract": "Feline fibrocystic hepatobiliary lesions (FHLs) and extrahepatic biliary malformations (EBMs) are supposedly common, but prevalence studies and detailed gross and histologic descriptions within a large cohort are lacking. Our aims were to identify the prevalence of FHLs and EBMs within a large feline population, characterize gross and histologic features, and report comorbidities. Of 140 cats, 20 (14.3%) had either FHLs and/or EBMs. FHLs were most common (15/20, 75%) and included cystic biliary lesions (CBLs, 14/20, 70%) and congenital hepatic fibrosis (CHF, 1/20, 5%). CBLs had gross variability but histologically comprised multiloculated cysts lined by biliary epithelium overlying variably hyalinized collagenous trabeculae. Gross features of CHF included severe hepatic fibrosis with embedded biliary cysts, parenchymal collapse, and nodular regeneration. Histologically, there was loss of lobular architecture, proliferation of small irregular to cystic bile ducts, bridging fibrosis, inapparent portal veins, and scattered hepatocellular necrosis. Gallbladder malformations were present in 5/20 cats (25%) and were classified as duplex (2/5) or bilobed (3/5). Two of 20 cats (10%) had anomalous, blind-ended, extrahepatic bile ducts extending from the gallbladder into the pancreas/peripancreatic mesentery. FHLs and EBMs were rarely concurrent (1/20 cats, 5%). CHF contributed to significant morbidity, but other FHLs/EBMs were incidental. Concurrent pancreatic/renal cysts were uncommon (2/20, 10%) and were seen in association with a CBL and CHF. Common comorbidities included cardiovascular and/or renal disease and neoplasia. We provide evidence that the majority of feline FHLs represent ductal plate malformations, with CBLs having morphologic features compatible with von Meyenburg complexes (VMCs)/biliary hamartomas."

    "abstract": "With the increased adoption of digital health solutions, such as telehealth, there is a need to consider current practices and considerations towards digital health Literacy. The objective of this review is to explore what digital health literacy considerations have been detailed in cystic fibrosis telehealth papers. The found papers published from a recent systematic review exploring telehealth within cystic fibrosis care were taken and analysed. These papers were obtained from PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases and included any paper written in English up to May 2021. Data pertaining to Health Literacy, Digital Literacy/Competency, Digital Health Literacy, Training, Readiness Assessments, and Sustained Use were extrapolated using Elicit AI Research Assistant 2024. From the 26 papers, the data of interest was sparse and mostly unavailable for this review. This may be due to several reasons; however the implication of this mitigation is discussed with reference to the digital divide, health in-equalities, and safety. This review highlights that a structured approach to assess digital health literacy of care teams and people with cystic fibrosis is critical to the future success of safe telehealth use, and other digital health solutions."

More recently, cases of acute myocardial infarction are reported in PwCF. The impact of elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor (ETI) on cholesterol and triglyceride (TG) concentrations, traditional cardiometabolic risk factors, is unknown. TC, LDL-C, HDL-C, and TG concentrations were analyzed from participants enrolled in the observational PROMISE study of clinically prescribed ETI prior to and 12-18 months after initiation. Pre-ETI and follow-up concentrations were compared, and relationships between TC, LDL-C, HDL-C and TG and clinical factors were tested using linear mixed-effect models.Fasting samples were available for 51 participants (25 M/26F, median age 17.4 y) with pancreatic exocrine insufficiency at baseline and 12-18 months after ETI initiation. TC and HDL-C were higher after 12-18 mo ETI in an unadjusted model, but with adjustment for BMI-Z, only HDL-C remained significantly higher at follow up (p < 0.05). Low HDL-C was the most common abnormality (>50 %), but prevalence of participants meeting criteria for low HDL-C did not differ between timepoints. In a population of youth and young adults with CF, TC and HDL-C were higher after 12-18 months of ETI, but differences in TC were attenuated with adjustment for BMI-Z. Prevalence of low HDL-C was high at both timepoints."

    "abstract": "Medication adherence data are an important quality indicator in cystic fibrosis (CF) care, yet real-time objective data are not routinely available. An online application (CFHealthHub) has been designed to deliver these data to people with CF and their clinical team. Adoption of this innovation is the focus of an National Health Service England-funded learning health system and Quality Improvement Collaborative (QIC). This study applies the capability, opportunity, and motivation model of behavior change to assess whether the QIC had supported healthcare professionals' uptake of accessing patient adherence data. This was a mixed-method study, treating each multidisciplinary team as an individual case. Click analytic data from CFHealthHub were collected between January 1, 2018, and September 22, 2019. Thirteen healthcare practitioners participated in semi-structured interviews, before and after establishing the QIC. Qualitative data were analyzed using the behavior change model. The cases showed varied improvement trajectories. While two cases reported reduced barriers, one faced persistent challenges. Participation in the QIC led to enhanced confidence in the platform's utility. Reduced capability, opportunity, and motivation barriers correlated with increased uptake, demonstrating value in integrating behavior change theory into QICs. QICs can successfully reduce barriers and enable uptake of e-health innovations such as adherence monitoring technology. However, ongoing multi-level strategies are needed to embed changes. Further research should explore sustainability mechanisms and their impact on patient outcomes."

    "title": "Gliadin-dependent UPR induction directly triggers the expression of TG2 and pro-inflammatory cytokines, dysregulates intestinal permeability, and reduces CFTR expression in intestinal epithelial cells of celiac disease patients.",
    "abstract": "Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disorder that primarily affects the gut of genetically predisposed individuals and is triggered by gliadin peptides (PT) produced by the digestion of gluten. Although inappropriate activation of the immune system is thought to be the main trigger of CD, the interaction between PT and intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) remains a key step. Recently, the possible involvement of ER stress in the pathogenesis of CD has been pointed out, although its role is still largely unclear. Therefore, discovering the molecular mechanism(s) activated in IECs exposed to PT represents a unique opportunity to better understand the disease and define new potential therapeutic targets. In this study we used three different experimental set-ups: intestinal biopsies from CD patients and non-CD control subjects, an in vitro model, based on human CaCo-2 cells, and an ex vivo model, based on our recently described mouse gut-ex-vivo system (GEVS), with the latter two systems were studied after stimulation with gliadin peptides (PT). To understand the signaling pathways involved we monitor the expression of a number of proteins by qPCR, Western blotting, IF, ELISA or a combination of tests. Specifically, we have analyzed the level of CD, ER stress, tissue permeability, and inflammation markers. Indeed, our study demonstrated a prompt induction of the transcription factors ATF4, ATF6 and XBP1 in IECs upon PT exposure. Thus, the upregulation of TG2 and downregulation of CFTR were prevented by ER stress inhibition/buffering by a pharmacological chaperone, also leading to restored physiological expression of OCL, CLD-2 and CLD-15, while preventing the expression of IFNγ, IL-15 and IL-17 A. Overall, our analysis has highlighted the key role of ER stress in the pathogenesis of CD and identified the chemical chaperones as a new potential valuable therapeutic treatment for CD patients."

    "abstract": "We aimed to investigate phenotypic and genomic traits of three Cupriavidus spp. isolates recovered from people with cystic fibrosis (PWCF). These bacteria are recognized as emerging pathogens in PWCF. Using short and long sequencing reads, we assembled three hybrid complete genomes for the genus Cupriavidus, adding to the 45 published currently, describing multipartite genomes and plasmids. The isolates likely represent three different species, and they carry a cumulative total of 30 antibiotic resistance genes with high homology to well-characterized resistance determinants from other bacteria. Multidrug resistance to antibiotics used in CF management was observed in all three isolates. However, two treatments were active across all isolates: cefotaxime and piperacillin/tazobactam. Biofilm formation was only seen at physiological temperatures (37°C) and lost at 20°C and all isolates had low lethality in Galleria mellonella larvae. Isolates demonstrated variable motility, with one non-motile isolate carrying a disrupted flhD transcriptional regulator, abolishing flagella expression. Our Cupriavidus spp. isolates showed considerable genomic and phenotypic variability that may impact their virulence and treatment in PWCF, where multidrug resistance will negate treatments and biofilm formation and motility play key roles in infection establishment, as seen in CF pathogens like Pseudomonas aeruginosa. More detailed investigation of clinical Cupriavidus isolates is needed for full understanding of the risk they pose to PWCF."

Here, we describe a patient with NCPH secondary to CFLD, with resolution of pH after starting a cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulator. As demonstrated in this patient, CFTR modulators may provide extra-pulmonary benefits including reversal of NCPH. Long-term use of CFTR modulators could potentially result in reductions in mortality from pH and need for future liver or combined lung-liver transplantation in patients with CFLD."

    "abstract": "Ensifentrine is a novel, low-molecular-weight molecule that is a selective, dual inhibitor of phosphodiesterase (PDE)3 and PDE4. Inhibition of PDE3 has been shown to relax airway smooth muscle and inhibition of PDE4 to inhibit inflammatory responses and to stimulate the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator in human airway epithelial cells through accumulation of intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate. Additionally, the dual inhibition of PDE3 and PDE4 demonstrates enhanced or synergistic effects compared with inhibition of either PDE3 or PDE4 alone on contraction of airway smooth muscle and suppression of inflammatory responses. Ensifentrine inhalation suspension 3 mg was recently approved in the USA for the maintenance treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in adult patients and is marketed under the trade name Ohtuvayre™. This manuscript describes further evidence that ensifentrine is a selective dual inhibitor of both human PDE3 and PDE4 enzymes and that this drug has significant anti-inflammatory activity in vivo in both allergic guinea pigs and non-human primates. This dual bronchodilator and anti-inflammatory activity of ensifentrine makes it a promising strategy as a novel inhaled \"bifunctional\" drug for the treatment of obstructive and inflammatory diseases of the respiratory tract."

The analytical method utilized protein precipitation with stable isotope dilution for sample preparation, facilitating a simple and rapid assay, with a total runtime of only 2.1 min. Separation of the seven components and stable isotope-labeled internal standards was achieved on a C<sub>18</sub> column, followed by detection using a tandem quadrupole mass spectrometer. Validation of the method was conducted in accordance with the \"Bioanalytical Method Validation Guidance for Industry,\" of the Food and Drug Administration and with European Medicines Agency's \"Guidance on bioanalytical method validation\". The assay covers concentrations ranging from 0.010 to 10 mg/L for ivacaftor, hydroxymethyl ivacaftor and N-desmethylelexacaftor, from 0.025 to 25 mg/L for elexacaftor and tezacaftor, from 0.050 to 50 mg/L for tezacaftor M1 and from 0.100 to 100 mg/L for lumacaftor, using a sample volume of 10 μL. Matrix comparison confirmed the applicability of the assay to human serum and heparin plasma. Stability experiments indicated stability of the CFTR modulators in EDTA plasma over ten days under different conditions. At room temperature, all seven components remained stable for eight days and for ten days in the refrigerator in EDTA plasma and in EDTA whole blood. All seven components were stable in EDTA plasma for ten days in the autosampler after sample preparation and through four freeze-thaw cycles. The developed assay was applied in routine TDM analysis to investigate exposure to elexacaftor, tezacaftor, ivacaftor and their metabolites in people with CF undergoing treatment with Kaftrio®."

The actual therapeutic regimen to treat <i>Mab</i> infections is based on repurposed drugs from therapies against <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> and <i>avium</i>. In addition to the need for new specific drugs against this bacterium, a possible strategy for shortening the therapeutic time and improving the success rate could be targeting <i>Mab</i> virulence factors. These drugs could become an important integration to the actual therapeutic regimen, helping the immune system to fight the infection. Moreover, this strategy applies a low selective pressure on the bacteria, since these elements are not essential for <i>Mab</i> survival but crucial for establishing the infection.

Demographics and clinical outcomes were obtained by retrospective review from 12 centers participating in the outpatient BPD Collaborative registry. The cohort consisted of infants born between 2016 and 2021 who were dependent on invasive mechanical ventilation at home. The respiratory outcomes of those infants with TBM were compared to those who did not have TBM. There were 154 subjects included and about half (48.7%) had documented TBM. Both the TBM and non-TBM groups had similar demographic characteristics and respiratory outcomes. However, the non-TBM were found to have lower mean birth weight (673 vs. 832 grams; p = 0.006), higher likelihood of having Nissen fundoplication (34.2% vs. 12.2%; p = 0.006) and higher use of diuretics (59.2% vs. 37.3%; p = 0.007). Both groups were similar in terms of ventilator requirements, timing of liberation from the ventilator, and rate of decannulation. The presence of TBM in ventilator-dependent infants with BPD did not affect ventilator support needs, liberation from the ventilator and the rate of tracheostomy decannulation. We speculate that the relative contributions of the other components of BPD disease may play critical roles in determining the need for tracheostomy and their ultimate respiratory outcomes. A prospective multicenter study to assess the impact of TBM in severe BPD is urgently needed."

Lysine polyphosphate modification (KPM), a strong but non-covalent interaction between polyP and lysine-rich protein sequences, has not been functionally characterized until now. In this study, we present the first investigation into KPM's biological significance using <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, a critical priority pathogen known for its antibiotic resistance and virulence. We identified two essential bacterial proteins, EngA and SrmB, as novel KPM targets. Through site-specific lysine deletions, we demonstrated that disrupting lysine-polyP interactions severely impairs biofilm formation and significantly reduces the production of key virulence factors, including pyoverdine and pyocyanin. These findings establish a direct functional link between polyP and bacterial pathogenicity mediated by KPM. Our results highlight KPM as a previously unrecognized regulatory mechanism critical for controlling bacterial virulence factors. This work uncovers the first functional role of KPM and its importance in regulating virulence phenotypes in a major human pathogen.IMPORTANCEPolyphosphate is commonly known for its roles in metabolism and stress response. How inorganic polyphosphate (polyP) facilitates bacterial virulence has remained largely elusive. This study reveals that lysine polyphosphate modification (KPM), a chemical interaction between polyP and lysine-rich proteins, is essential for bacterial survival and pathogenicity in <i>P. aeruginosa</i>, a harmful microbe responsible for difficult-to-treat infections. We discovered that disrupting KPM in key proteins impairs the bacteria's ability to form protective biofilms and produce harmful toxins. This previously unknown biological process links polyP to protein function in controlling bacterial virulence factors. Our findings open new possibilities for developing anti-virulence therapies aimed at reducing bacterial infections without promoting antibiotic resistance."

Pain sources included lung/chest, head/sinus, joint, bone, back, neuropathic, GI; 100% reported multiple sources. Pain experience: A major theme was the close interrelationship of pain and CF. Subthemes included pain being part of life with CF, having CF leads to high pain tolerance and effects of aging with CF. Participants described CFTR modulators effect pain experiences with 3 noting improvement and 4 worsening pain. Pain centralization was common: fatigue, difficulties with cognition/sleep, increased sensitivity to nonpainful stimuli. Pain impact: Pain has a widespread negative impact on quality of life and especially mental health. Resiliency was a theme: the need for coping strategies, support and strong self-advocacy. Advice for CF Care Teams: Participants endorsed a need for increased acknowledgment of pain experiences and co-development of a treatment plan. Pain remains a prominent, burdensome symptom in the modulator era, necessitating a multi-component management approach. Results informed the development and pilot of a mind-body pain intervention for adults with CF."

In a cohort of 664 children with severe lung disease 594 were either PCR-tested or had an antibody test for SARS-CoV-2 infection due to symptoms or exposure and 18 (3%) had verified SARS-CoV-2 infection. The total number of verified SARS-CoV-2 infection was at that time 34.575(4.342%) thus, not significantly different from the reference population (p = 0.152). The symptoms ranged from asymptomatic to mild symptoms, and none of the children with severe lung disease required hospitalization due to COVID-19. None of the children were treated with antiviral treatment during the acute infection. Of the 664 children in the Danish cohort with severe lung disease, none were hospitalized with COVID-19.

Among these, bacteriophage therapy has regained attention as a promising approach to combat multidrug-resistant bacteria. Bacteriophages are viruses that infect and lyse specific bacterial strains, making them attractive candidates for targeted antimicrobial treatment. Burkholderia multivorans, a Gram-negative bacterium, is known to cause opportunistic infections, particularly in individuals with a compromised immune system or with cystic fibrosis. The prevalence of antibiotic-resistant Burkholderia strains has raised concerns about treatment options. In this study, we characterized the Burkholderia phage Bm1, a virulent bacteriophage isolated from an environmental source. Electron microscopy revealed that Bm1 phage particles have myovirus morphology, with an icosahedral head of 72 nm in diameter and a contractile tail of 100 nm in length and 18 nm in width. The genome of phage Bm1 consists of a double-stranded DNA of 67,539 bp with a terminal repeat region at each end. Comparative analysis indicated that the closest relative of phage Bm1 is Burkholderia phage BCSR129, with a calculated VIRIDIC identity of 57.7%. The apparent absence of an integrase gene suggests that the Burkholderia phage Bm1 has a strictly lytic life cycle."

We hypothesized that delayed perfusion can be detected by dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE-)MRI and that bronchial artery dilatation (BAD) is associated with changes in lung perfusion. Morpho-functional MRI was prospectively acquired in 75 patients with CF (18.7 ± 7.6 years, range 6-39 years). Lungs and perfusion defects were segmented automatically to quantify perfusion defects in percent (QDP). Pulmonary blood flow (PBF), mean transit time (MTT), and perfusion delay were calculated for the whole lung, inside normally perfused and perfusion defect areas. Chest MRI score and BAD were assessed visually. QDP and PBF correlated with MRI global score (r = 0.58 and -0.53, p < 0.001). In normally perfused lung, PBF was higher (161.2 ± 77.9 mL/100 mL/min vs. 57.5 ± 26.4 mL/100 mL/min, p < 0.001), and MTT (5.4 ± 1.7 s vs. 6.9 ± 2.3 s, p < 0.001) and perfusion delay were shorter than in perfusion defect areas (4.6 ± 5.3 s vs. 13.4 ± 16.2 s, p < 0.001). 48 (64.0%) patients showed BAD, had higher QDP (44.6 ± 20.8% vs. 17.3 ± 11.0%, p < 0.001) and lower PBF (91.9 ± 54.8 mL/100 mL/min vs. 178.3 ± 77.4 mL/100 mL/min, p < 0.001) than patients without BAD. MTT was shorter (6.3 ± 1.9 s vs. 8.0 ± 2.6 s, p < 0.001), and perfusion delay was longer (13.8 ± 10.1 s vs. 12.8 ± 23.7 s, p < 0.02) inside perfusion defects of patients with BAD compared to without BAD. Perfusion parameters correlate with lung disease severity, and perfusion defects showed delayed perfusion in patients with CF. BAD was associated with more extensive perfusion defects and reduced PBF. Question Dilated bronchial arteries are a common comorbidity in cystic fibrosis (CF), which can cause hemoptysis, but their quantitative contribution to lung perfusion is little researched. Findings Perfusion defects in percent (QDP) enabled objective assessment of perfusion abnormalities in CF patients, while perfusion delay and arterial correlation showed bronchial artery perfusion contribution. Clinical relevance The usage of quantitative perfusion metrics in CF may help tracking disease progression. By also including the proposed metrics perfusion delay and arterial correlation, bronchial artery inflow could be assessed and used to detect early onset of bronchial artery dilation."

    "abstract": "Using the Australian Census survey 2021 as base population, a microsimulation model, PreconMOD was developed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of population-based expanded reproductive carrier screening (RCS) for 569 recessive conditions from the health service and societal perspectives. The model simulated the effect of expanded RCS including the downstream interventions for at-risk couples on cost and outcomes. The comparators were (i) no population screening (ii) limited screening for cystic fibrosis, spinal muscular atrophy, and fragile X syndrome and (iii) a 300 conditions screening panel. Averted affected births and health service cost with expanded RCS were projected to year 2061. At a 50% uptake, our model predicts that expanded RCS is cost saving (i.e., higher quality-adjusted life-years and lower costs) compared with other screening strategies in the model from the health service and societal perspectives. The number of affected births averted in a single cohort would increase from 84 [95% confidence interval (CI) 60-116] with limited screening to 2067 (95%CI 1808-2376) with expanded RCS. Expanded RCS was cost-saving compared to the 300-conditions screening panel. Indirect cost accounted for about one-third of the total costs associated with recessive disorders. Our model predicts that the direct treatment cost associated with current limited 3 genes screening would increase by 20% each year to A$73.4 billion to the health system by 2061. Our findings contribute insights on the cost burden of genetic diseases and the economic benefits of expanded RCS to better informed resource allocation decisions."

    "abstract": "Highly effective modulator therapies (HEMT) are increasing the lifespan for many people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF), making it necessary to identify and understand CF specific age-related consequences. In this study, we examine the impact of aging on cognitive function and age-related brain pathology in a CF mouse model focusing on phospho-Tau (pTau) pathology. Cognitive function was measured by novel object recognition and spontaneous alternation behavior tests. Hippocampal neuronal function was assessed by measuring long-term potentiation (LTP) electrophysiology, the synaptic correlate of learning and memory. Tau pathology was assessed by immunohistochemical analyses and western blot assessment of pTau levels in CF mouse brain, as well as human nasal epithelial cells isolated from pwCF. Cognitive function declined progressively with age in Cftr (G542X/G542X) (G542X) mice, a model of CF, compared to wild-type (WT) littermate controls. LTP was also deficient in older G542X mice. Increased pTau was observed by staining and western blot analysis in the hippocampus of aged CF mice. Secondary impacts of tauopathy, including increased microglial uptake of cholesterol and reduced neuronal density were also observed. Lastly, human nasal epithelial cells from pwCF were found to display elevated pTau levels compared to non-CF controls. Aging CF mice develop tauopathy, cognitive decline, LTP impairment, microglial activation, and neurodegeneration that is not experienced by age-matched WT littermates, a condition herein termed cystic fibrosis-related neurodegeneration (CFND). These findings suggest that pwCF may be at risk for tauopathy-related neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment with aging."

We undertook a systematic review to exploring the use of implementation science strategies by CF registries for healthcare improvement. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, Emcare and Web of Science databases for use of Expert Recommendations for Implementing Change (ERIC) implementations and use of the Knowledge to Action framework for improvement. We used the Risk of Bias in Non-randomised Studies - of Interventions tool for risk-of-bias assessment. 1974 citations were identified and 12 studies included. Included studies described 45 ERIC implementation strategies from nine categories. Strategies included \"use evaluative and iterative strategies\" (n=9) and \"develop stakeholder interrelationships\" (n=10). Least-used strategies were \"utilise financial strategies\" (n=1), \"support clinicians\" category (n=3) and \"provide interactive assistance\" (n=2). All 12 studies utilised monitoring of knowledge use, and assessing barriers and facilitators of knowledge use. Only seven studies utilised mechanisms to sustain knowledge use. Reported studies describe significant benefits in important CF outcomes for people with CF reported at site-specific and population levels. Studies highlighted the importance of governance, leadership, patient and family engagement, multidisciplinary engagement, quality improvement, data and analytics and research. The ready availability of clinical performance data feedback to clinicians and patients by CF registries is likely to strengthen the effectiveness of CF registries in driving healthcare improvement within a learning health system."

    "title": "Succinate Chemosensing Induces CFTR-dependent Airway Clearance Which Is Impaired in Cystic Fibrosis.",
    "abstract": "The respiratory tract possesses a highly regulated innate defence system which includes cilia-mediated mucociliary clearance (MCC). Efficient MCC relies on appropriate hydration of airway surfaces, which is controlled by a blend of transepithelial sodium and liquid absorption, and anion and liquid secretion The latter is primarily mediated by the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) anion channel. Succinate is derived from parasites, microorganisms and inflammatory cells, and its concentration increases in the airway surface liquid (ASL) during infections, activating the G-protein coupled succinate receptor (SUCNR1), which acts as a succinate sensor. Since MCC is tightly regulated by second messengers we tested the hypothesis that succinate signalling was linked to CFTR activity. We observed that SUCNR1 activation stimulated anion secretion, increased mucus transport, and induced tracheal constriction in mouse airways. In the <i>Cftr</i><sup>ΔF508/ΔF508</sup> mouse, increased mucus transport and tracheal constriction were observed, while succinate-induced electrogenic anion secretion remained unaffected. Stimulation of normal human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) with succinate activated CFTR-dependent anion secretion and increased ASL height. Moreover, when HBECs derived from ΔF508-CF individuals lacked succinate-induced anion secretion, unless incubated with elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor (ETI), which restored succinate-induced anion secretion, confirming the tight relationship between SUCNR1 signalling and CFTR function. We have identified a novel mechanism for regulating CFTR/MCC activation which is defective in CF airways. We propose that succinate acts as a danger molecule that alerts the airways to the presence of pathogens leading to a flushing out of the airways."

Because a low number of Th17 lymphocytes is associated with the risk of fungal infections, we investigated inflammatory markers, Th17 cells, and T-cell polarization in CF patients with ABPA. We analyzed the levels of inflammatory markers, blood counts, chemokines, cytokines, and T cell subsets in blood and sputum of CF subjects to elucidate the immunological factors associated with CF patients with Aspergillus fumigatus (AF) positive sputum (AFS<sup>+</sup>) or with ABPA. We observed that AFS+ patients have higher sputum and blood IL-6 levels than AF-negative sputum (AFS<sup>-</sup>) patients. Analysis of blood memory T-helper subsets associated with Th1, Th2, and Th17 polarization among circulating CD45RA-/CD4+ memory T-cell subsets showed higher numbers of CCR4<sup>+</sup>/CCR6<sup>+</sup>/CXCR3<sup>-</sup> and CCR4<sup>+</sup>/CCR6<sup>+</sup>/CXCR3<sup>+</sup> memory CD4 cells in AFS+ compared to AFS<sup>-</sup> subjects. Further analysis of Th17-related subsets and IL-17 secreting T cells in subjects with AFS+ showed that those with ABPA have statistically significantly lower levels of Th17 cells as compared to those without ABPA. In CF, AF airway colonization is associated with increased blood counts of Th17-related subsets. However, CF patients with ABPA exhibit lower numbers of CCR4+/CCR6+/CXCR3+ memory CD4 cells and IL-17-secreting CD4 cells compared to control subjects and CF patients without AF sensitization."

    "abstract": "The incidence of infection by nontuberculous mycobacteria, mainly <i>Mycobacterium abscessus</i>, is increasing in patients with cystic fibrosis and other chronic pulmonary diseases, leading to an accelerated lung function decline. In most cases, <i>M. abscessus</i> coinfects <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, the most common pathogen in these conditions. However, how these two bacterial species interact during infection remains poorly understood. This study explored their behaviour in three relevant pathogenic settings: dual-species biofilm development using a recently developed method to monitor individual species in dual-species biofilms, coinfection in bronchial epithelial cells, and <i>in vivo</i> coinfection in the <i>Galleria mellonella</i> model. The results demonstrated that both species form stable mixed biofilms and reciprocally inhibit single-biofilm progression. Coinfections in bronchial epithelial cells significantly decreased cell viability, whereas in <i>G. mellonella</i>, coinfections induced lower survival rates than individual infections. Analysis of the immune response triggered by each bacterium in bronchial epithelial cell assays and <i>G. mellonella</i> larvae revealed that <i>P. aeruginosa</i> induces the overexpression of proinflammatory and melanization cascade responses, respectively. In contrast, <i>M. abscessus</i> and <i>P. aeruginosa</i> coinfection significantly inhibited the immune response in both models, resulting in worse consequences for the host than those generated by a single <i>P. aeruginosa</i> infection. Overall, this study highlights the novel role of <i>M. abscessus</i> in suppressing immune responses during coinfection with <i>P. aeruginosa</i>, emphasizing the clinical implications for the management of cystic fibrosis and other pulmonary diseases. Understanding these interactions could inform the development of new therapeutic strategies to mitigate the severity of coinfections in vulnerable patients."

    "abstract": "Biological sex is known to affect the incidence and outcomes of infection, varying significantly by pathogen. The bacterial pathogen <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> is recognized as a serious global healthcare threat worldwide, yet understanding of how biological sex impacts its infection course is limited. We previously documented in a murine model of acute pneumonia that female mice were more susceptible to infection, but there are no published studies looking at outcomes in humans according to biological sex. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 220 adult patients with a positive <i>A. baumannii</i> culture and clinical evidence of pneumonia. Contrary to the animal data, we observed male patients to have a longer overall (32 vs 24 days, <i>P</i> < 0.05) and intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay (LOS) (23 vs 17 days, <i>P</i> < 0.001) compared to females. The primary diagnosis at admission was only a factor when it was respiratory in nature. Younger male patients had higher Pneumonia Severity Index score on admission compared to younger females. Older males required more interventions than younger males. We also observed that mortality rates were increased for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (<i>P</i> = 0.024) and renal disease (<i>P</i> < 0.001), while alcohol use or smoking within 30 days prior to admission or recent surgery all negatively impacted LOS. This study highlights the importance of sex-and-gender-based studies, identifying worse outcomes in men, the elderly, and patients with certain underlying conditions and guiding efforts to improve management of patients with <i>A. baumannii</i> pneumonia. Biological sex has been shown to influence the incidence and outcomes of infection. We had previously documented that in a mouse model of infection, the pathogen <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> caused more serious pulmonary disease in female animals. In this study, we aimed to determine if this was evident in human pneumonia data. We found that, opposite to the mice data, human males had extended hospital stays due to <i>A. baumannii</i> pneumonia. We also identified a number of risk factors that can impact mortality and duration of hospital stay. This information could be used to guide efforts to improve management of patients with <i>A. baumannii</i> pneumonia."

    "abstract": "To overcome the challenges of developing a gene therapy for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), we focused on the surface receptors expressed in cystic epithelia. Importantly, we detected altered localization in the cystic epithelium of wheat germ agglutinin, WGA, staining of sialic acids. Throughout the membrane of the cysts, we saw altered staining with <i>Maackia amurensis</i> lectin (MAL) or with <i>Sambucus nigra</i> lectin (SNL) that are specific for α2,3- and α2,6-<i>N</i>-linked sialic acids, respectively. Given that these sialic acid glycoproteins facilitate the transduction of adeno-associated virus 1 (AAV1), we injected 1-mo-old, <i>pkd1<sup>R3277C/R3277C</sup></i>, (RC/RC) ADPKD mice intraperitoneally with 2 × 10<sup>12</sup> particles/kg of AAV1 containing either a green fluorescent protein (GFP) vector or a truncated cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) vector, Δ27-264-CFTR. Two months after treatment, the cyst area and size were significantly lower in the CFTR vector-treated mice compared with those untreated and those receiving the GFP. We detected vector genomes and mRNA expression only in their corresponding CFTR vector- or GFP vector-treated mice. We observed co-staining for GFP and CFTR immunofluorescence with either the Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger or epithelial Na<sup>+</sup> channel, indicating proximal tubule or collecting duct expression, respectively. Expression of GFP and CFTR protein expression above background levels was detected. CFTR immunofluorescence was increased in the basolateral membrane after CFTR vector instillation. Finally, these data suggest that cysts are prime targets for AAV1 gene therapy and offer an exciting prospect for ADPKD gene therapy.<b>NEW & NOTEWORTHY</b> Current therapies for ADPKD involve treatment of the symptoms. A direct approach would involve a gene therapy. Here we show AAV1 is tropic for cystic epithelia, which have abundant expression of sialic acid resides known to enhance AAV1 transduction. We show that a CFTR-based vector can reduce cyst size, suggesting that it may be therapeutic.

    "title": "Role of <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> Dnr-regulated denitrification in oxic conditions.",
    "abstract": "<i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> causes acute and chronic infections such as those that occur in the lungs of people with cystic fibrosis (CF). In infection environments, oxygen (O <sub>2</sub> ) concentrations are often low. The transcription factor Anr responds to low O <sub>2</sub> by upregulating genes necessary for <i>P. aeruginosa</i> fitness in microoxic and anoxic conditions. Anr regulates <i>dnr</i> , a gene encoding a transcriptional regulator that promotes the expression of genes required for using nitrate as an alternative electron acceptor during denitrification. In CF sputum, transcripts involved in denitrification are highly expressed. While Dnr is necessary for the anoxic growth of <i>P. aeruginosa</i> in CF sputum and artificial sputum media (ASMi), the contribution of denitrification to <i>P. aeruginosa</i> fitness in oxic conditions has not been well described. Here we show that <i>P. aeruginosa</i> requires <i>dnr</i> for fitness in ASMi and the requirement for <i>dnr</i> is abolished when nitrate is excluded from the media. Additionally, we show that <i>P. aeruginosa</i> consumes nitrate in lysogeny broth (LB) under microoxic conditions. Furthermore, strains without a functioning quorum sensing regulator LasR, which leads to elevated Anr activity, consume nitrate in LB even in normoxia. There was no growth advantage for <i>P. aeruginosa</i> when nitrate was present at concentrations from 100 µM to 1600 µM. However, <i>P. aeruginosa</i> consumption of nitrate in oxic conditions created a requirement for Dnr and Dnr-regulated NorCB likely due to the need to detoxify nitric oxide. These studies suggest that Anr- and Dnr-regulated processes may impact <i>P. aeruginosa</i> physiology in many common culture conditions. <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> is an opportunistic pathogen commonly isolated from low-oxygen environments such as the lungs of people with cystic fibrosis. While the importance of <i>P. aeruginosa</i> energy generation by denitrification is clear in anoxic environments, the effects of denitrification in oxic cultures is not clear. Here, we show that nitrate is consumed even in oxic environments and while it does not appear to stimulate growth, it does impact fitness. Further, we report that two regulators that are best known for their roles in anoxic conditions also contribute to <i>P. aeruginosa</i> fitness in commonly- used laboratory media in presence of oxygen."

    "title": "Filamentous cheater phages drive bacterial and phage populations to lower fitness.",
    "abstract": "Many bacteria carry phage genome(s) in their chromosome (i.e., prophage), and this intertwines the fitness of the bacterium and the phage. Most <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> strains carry filamentous phages called Pf that establish chronic infections and do not require host lysis to spread. However, spontaneous mutations in the Pf repressor gene ( <i>pf5r</i> ) can allow extreme phage production that slows bacterial growth and increases cell death, violating an apparent détente between bacterium and phage. We observed this paradoxical outcome in an evolution experiment with <i>P. aeruginosa</i> in media simulating nutrients from the cystic fibrosis airway. Bacteria containing <i>pf5r</i> mutant phage grow to a lower density but directly outcompete their ancestor and convert them into <i>pf5r</i> mutants via phage superinfection. Reduced fitness therefore spreads throughout the bacterial population, driven by weaponized Pf. Yet high intracellular phage replication facilitates another evolutionary conflict: \"cheater miniphages\" lacking capsid genes invade populations of full-length phages within cells. Although bacteria containing both full-length phages and miniphages are most immune to superinfection by limiting the Pf receptor, this hybrid vigor is extremely unstable, as a classic Tragedy of the Commons scenario ensues that results in complete prophage loss. The entire cycle - from phage hyperactivation to miniphage invasion to prophage loss - can occur within 24h, showcasing rapid coevolution between bacteria and their filamentous phages. This study demonstrates that <i>P. aeruginosa</i> , and potentially many other bacterial species that carry filamentous prophages, risk being exploited by these phages in a runaway process that reduces fitness of both host and virus."

In the genetic disease Cystic Fibrosis (CF), chronic antibiotic resistant <i>Pseudomonas</i> lung infections and persistent inflammation remain the leading causes of morbidity and mortality. While highly effective modulator therapy (HEMT) dramatically improves lung function in CF, they fail to eradicate chronic infections or eliminate the associated hyperinflammatory state. Thus, there is an urgent need for innovative therapies that can simultaneously eliminate antibiotic resistant <i>P. aeruginosa</i> lung infection and the attendant hyperinflammatory lung environment. Mesenchymal stromal cell-derived extracellular vesicles (MSC EVs) represent a promising solution, offering potent anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and antimicrobial properties while being safe and non-toxic. This study demonstrates using a CF mouse model of infection that MSC EVs reduce acute <i>P. aeruginosa</i> lung infection and inflammation. MSC EVs reduced <i>Pseudomonas</i> burden, immune cell infiltration, and pro-inflammatory cytokine levels. As the first investigation of MSC EVs in CF, this research underscores the dual effects of MSC EVs; mitigating inflammation and reducing bacterial burden. These findings mark an important advancement in antimicrobial therapy, addressing the unmet need for reducing antibiotic resistant infections and hyperinflammation for people with CF as well as the multitude of others with chronic, antibiotic resistant <i>P. aeruginosa</i> lung infections.

Approximately 98% of MwCF have congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD).

This study retrospectively examines testicular function and intracytoplasmic sperm injection outcomes of the partners of males with CBAVD, stratified by CF mutation status (CF, CF carriers, no known mutation). This multicenter, retrospective study assessed sperm retrieval outcomes and testicular function in males with CBAVD. Participants were categorized into three groups: MwCF (Group 1), CFTR gene mutation carriers (CFTR carriers, Group 2), and CBAVD males without CFTR mutations (Group 3). We collected data on genetic testing, testicular hormone levels (FSH, LH, total testosterone), sperm retrieval methods, and reproductive outcomes. Statistical analysis was used to assess intergroup differences. Thirty subjects were included (Group 1: 14, Group 2: 11, Group 3: 5). No significant differences in demographic, anthropometric, or reproductive characteristics were found across groups. Hormone levels (LH, FSH, and testosterone) were similar among groups. In Group 1, 42 % had elevated FSH levels. The prevalence of hypogonadism was 16.7 % in Group 1. Group 3 had a significantly lower fertilization rate (p < 0.01), but no differences were found in blastocyst formation, pregnancy, miscarriage, or live birth rates.

A systematic review by the EAACI CO-FAITH taskforce recently flagged the need to better standardize and harmonize outcomes used in clinical trials of food-AIT. Using less objective symptoms to define dose-limiting symptoms can underestimate the reaction threshold determined at baseline food challenge. As a consequence, this can overestimate the efficacy of food-AIT by 15%. In this review, we perform an individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis using data from three randomized-controlled trials and one real-world registry, to evaluate how the definition of dose \"tolerance\" impacts upon reported desensitization rates. This analysis provides insight into how clinical efficacy rates for food-AIT are impacted by using different dose thresholds and definitions for when a dose might be consider tolerated. Using more patient-centric outcomes may be a more useful metric to harmonize reporting of outcomes and inform clinical practice, paving the way towards reaching a consensus on outcome reporting in trials of food-AIT."

    "abstract": "Pulmonary aspergillosis is a major global health concern, yet its diagnosis remains challenging. Aspergillus-specific IgG measurement is essential for identifying chronic and allergic forms. This study aimed to evaluate a quantitative method, the ImmunoCAP assay IgG m3 (ICAP) (Phadia-ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, USA), a qualitative method, the Aspergillus IgG Western blot kit (Asp-WB) (LDBio Diagnostics, Lyon, France) and a combination of both methods for the diagnosis of Aspergillus lung disease. A retrospective study was conducted at the University Hospital of Marseille, France, during 1 year. Patients undergoing Aspergillus serology were divided into three groups: Group 1 (G1) with ICAP ≥ 40 mgA/L and positive Asp-WB, Group 2 (G2) with ICAP ≥ 40 mgA/L and negative Asp-WB and Group 3 (G3) with ICAP < 40 mgA/L and positive Asp-WB. Data were collected on demographics, underlying diseases, imaging and biological outcomes. Patients were classified according to their Aspergillus lung disease, whether acute pulmonary aspergillosis, chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA), allergic broncho-pulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), colonisation or Aspergillus sensitisation. A total of 536 patients were studied: 173 in G1, 204 in G2 and 200 in G3, with 38 patients found in several groups. The primary underlying disease was cystic fibrosis in 44.6% of patients. Twenty-two patients were diagnosed with ABPA. The number of diagnosed ABPA cases in G1 (20; 11.6%) combining positive ICAP and Asp-WB was significantly higher than that found in the groups with a single positive test result (p < 0.001). Fifteen patients were diagnosed with CPA. Isolated positive Western blot (G3) identified five cases of aspergilloma. Significantly fewer Aspergillus lung diseases were diagnosed in isolated positive ICAP G2 (8.8%) than in G1 (53.8%) and G3 (42.5%) (p < 0.001). This study highlights the benefits of combining Asp-WB and ICAP for the diagnosis of Aspergillus lung disease and the relatively high false-positive rate in patients with isolated positive ICAP results."

    "title": "Cilia Plays a Pivotal Role in the Hypersecretion of Airway Mucus in Mice.",
    "abstract": "Airway mucus hypersecretion is a prominent pathophysiological characteristic observed in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis, and asthma. It is a significant risk factor for lung dysfunction and impaired quality of life. Therefore, it is crucial to investigate changes in the major genes expressed in the lungs during airway mucus hypersecretion. Such investigations can help to identify genetic targets for the development of effective treatments to manage airway mucus hypersecretion and improve clinical outcomes for those affected by these respiratory disorders. Our study aims to identify changes in the expression of key genes in the lungs during airway mucus hypersecretion in mice. Thirty male C57BL/6 mice were randomly allocated into two groups. The Pyocyanin (PCN) group was intranasally infected with 25 μl of pyocyanin solution (1 μg/μl), while the phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) group received 25 μl of PBS intranasally once daily. The lung tissue of mice was extracted after 21 days for the purpose of identifying causal genes through a combination of transcriptomic and proteomic analysis. Finally, we validated the differentially expressed proteins using qRT-PCR and western blot. Our findings revealed significant alterations in 35,268 genes and 7,004 proteins within the lung tissue of mice treated with PCN. Pathway enrichment analysis, utilizing the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database, showed that the differentially expressed proteins were mainly associated with apoptosis, galactose metabolism, and asthma, among the overlapping genes and proteins. To validate the results of the transcriptomic and proteomic analyses, we used qRT-PCR to examine the expression levels of fourteen differentially expressed proteins (DEPs), namely Fpr1, Ear1, Lama3, Col19a1, Spag16, Ropn1l, Dnali1, Cfap70, Ear2, Drc1, Ifit3, Lrrc23, Slpi, and Fam166b. Subsequently, we confirmed the expression of Spag16, Dnali1, and Ropn1l by western blotting. Our study identified three DEPs, namely Spag16, Dnali1, and Ropn1l, which are closely associated with the movement and organization of cilia. This study provides novel insights for the development of therapeutic interventions targeting airway mucus hypersecretion."

    "abstract": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is common genetic disorder in Europe and North America but rarer in Asian populations. To explore the clinical manifestations and gene mutations of cystic fibrosis. This case series study enrolled children with CF diagnosed in the pediatric respiratory department of Shandong Provincial Hospital affiliated to Shandong First Medical University between June 2016 and August 2022. Seven children, including 6 girls and 1 boy, were enrolled. All 7 patients had recurrent wet cough and (chronic) pneumonia. Six patients suffered from chronic sinusitis, 4 patients had recurrent wheezing; 2 patients had chronic diarrhea, malnutrition and growth lag; 2 patients were complicated by allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis; and 1 patient had pancreatic insufficiency. Bronchiectasis, thickening of bronchial wall and mucous impaction, were seen in the chest CT of 7 children. Six patients showed a large amount of viscous sputum adhered to the bronchial wall by bronchoscopy. Infection of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was found in 6 cases, Staphylococcus aureus in 2 cases, and Aspergillus fumigatus in 2 cases by bronchoalveolar lavage fluid or sputum culture. Sweat sodium chloride test was performed in 3 cases, and the result showed that Cl-> 60 mmol/L. CFTR gene mutations were found in 7 cases, which were rare mutations of Caucasians, including 2 cases with new mutation sites (c.325T>G and 326A>G). The major clinical presentations of CF could be chronic and recurrent upper and lower respiratory tract infections, malnutrition, and digestive tract diseases. The rare and even new mutations of Caucasians on CFTR gene may occur in Chinese children."

    "title": "How Effectively Can Oxidative Stress and Inflammation Be Reversed When CFTR Function Is Pharmacologically Improved?",
    "abstract": "A critical challenge in the age of advanced modulator therapies is to understand and determine how effectively chronic oxidative stress and oxidative stress-induced inflammation can be reversed and physiological balance restored when CFTR function is pharmacologically improved. The triple therapy with elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor (ETI) suggests that CFTR activity in individuals with at least one F508del mutation can be partially restored to about 50% of normal levels. Although incomplete, the partial recovery of CFTR function has been shown to drastically lower sputum pathogen content, enhance microbiome diversity, and lower inflammation markers within the first year of treatment in adolescents and adults with cystic fibrosis. However, despite these advancements, residual airway infection, oxidative stress and inflammation persist, with levels similar to other chronic lung conditions, like non-CF bronchiectasis. This persistence highlights the necessity for innovative antioxidant and anti-inflammatory treatments, in particular for individuals with advanced lung disease. To address this issue, emerging multi-omics technologies offer valuable tools to investigate the impact of modulator therapies on various molecular pathways. By analyzing changes in gene expression, epigenetic modifications, protein profiles and metabolic processes in airway-derived samples, it could be possible to uncover the mechanisms driving persistent oxidative stress and inflammation. These insights could pave the way for identifying new therapeutic targets to fully restore airway health and overall physiological balance."

    "abstract": "The primary objective of this study was to examine the performance of the Asthma Clinical Score (ACS) relative to the Pediatric Respiratory Assessment Measure (PRAM). Our secondary objectives were to determine interrater reliability, discriminative validity, responsiveness, and predictive validity of the ACS and PRAM. This was a single-site prospective observational study of children ages 2 to < 18 years presenting to the emergency department (ED) for asthma exacerbations. Clinicians completed paired assessments using ACS and PRAM at three time points of each patients ED stay. Construct validity correlating the performance of the ACS to PRAM, and interrater reliability were analyzed using Spearmen's rank correlation coefficients and Cohen's kappa coefficient, respectively. Cohen's d was calculated to compare the scores of patients who received certain treatments to patients who did not. Reliable change index (RCI) was used to determine the responsiveness of each score. Predictive validity for hospitalization was analyzed using Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROCc) and Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). 399 children were enrolled with 338 paired clinician observations. The ACS and PRAM scores were strongly correlated at all time points (n = 1383, <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"> <semantics> <mrow><mrow><mi>ρ</mi></mrow> </mrow> <annotation>$\\rho $</annotation></semantics> </math> = 0.874). Both the ACS and PRAM showed moderate interrater reliability at all time points (n = 338, κ<sub>w</sub> = 0.77 and κ<sub>w</sub> = 0.69, respectively). Patients receiving albuterol nebulization or adjunctive medications had higher average ACS and PRAM scores. ACS showed a better ability to detect responsiveness than the PRAM (31% vs 15% respectively). The pretreatment ACS showed comparable predictive validity to the PRAM. The ACS was highly correlated with PRAM and is a reliable score in this cohort. The ACS showed good discriminative validity, predictive validity and responsiveness. This study supports the ACS as a useful tool in ED assessment of asthma exacerbation severity in children."

In this study, we developed a unique 3D lung submucosal gland ductal airway model utilizing primary human submucosal gland epithelial cells, which enables the formation of physiologically relevant architecture of the ductal epithelium including ciliary cells within a 3D bioprinted scaffold. Our observation demonstrates that this model not only enables the fabrication of human lung submucosal gland ductal airway-like structure mimicking <i>in vivo</i> physiology, also facilitates quantitative measurement of patient-specific MCC and determines pharmacological effects. Our results suggest that this model could be a valuable tool for understanding mechanisms underlying impaired MCC and testing the efficacy of novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of respiratory diseases such as cystic fibrosis."

    "abstract": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a complex monogenic disorder with a large variability in disease severity. Growing evidence suggests that the variation observed depends not only on variations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (<i>CFTR</i>) gene but also on modifier genes. Utilizing five databases (including CINAHL, PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus, and Web of Science), a systematic review was conducted to examine the current literature on the known impacts of genomic variations in modifier genes on the CF disease progression, severity, and therapeutic response. A total of 70 full-text articles describing over 80 gene modifiers associated with CF were selected. The modifier genes included genes associated with the CFTR interactome, the inflammatory response, microbial profiles, and other genes affecting the critical physiological pathways of multiple organ systems, such as the respiratory and gastrointestinal systems. Limitations of the existing literature embrace the lack of clinical studies investigating pharmacogenetic impacts and the significance of gene modifiers on the CF clinical picture, including a limited number of replication and validation studies. Further investigations into other potential gene modifiers using genome-wide association studies are needed to critically explore new therapeutic targets and provide a better understanding of the CF disease phenotype under specific drug treatments."

    "abstract": "An expanding array of inhaled antibiotic therapies can be effective for the treatment of chronic <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> (<i>P. aeruginosa</i>) infection in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) and non-CF bronchiectasis (NCFB). Nonetheless, there is a paucity of direct studies comparing the curative effects of these regimens. This network meta-analysis (NMA) aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of different inhaled antibiotic therapies for the relative short-term (4 weeks) and long-term (≥4 months) management of chronic <i>P. aeruginosa</i> infection in patients with CF and NCFB, respectively. We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane Library database as at 25<sup>th</sup> February, 2024. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving inhaled antibiotic therapies for treatment of CF or NCFB were thoroughly screened. We conducted this NMA within a Bayesian framework. The surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) was calculated to estimate relative effects of interventions per outcome. A total of 39 RCTs were included, involving 18 inhaled antibiotic treatment regimens and 7,486 participants. The primary outcomes assessed were microbiological efficacy and tolerability. According to SUCRA results, for patients with CF, tobramycin inhalation powder (TIP) had the best profile regarding microbiological efficacy at both short-term and long-term follow-up (SUCRA, 94.5%; 90.5%). Colistin for inhalation (SUCRA, 84.0%) and tobramycin inhalation solution (TIS; SUCRA, 75.7%) had the best tolerability profile at short-term and long-term follow-up, respectively. For patients with NCFB, TIP (SUCRA, 84.2%) and gentamicin injectable solution (GM) for inhalation (SUCRA, 92.2%) had the best profile regarding microbiological efficacy at short-term and long-term follow-up, respectively. Ciprofloxacin inhalation powder had the best tolerability profile at both short-term and long-term follow-up (SUCRA, 66.4%; 85.6%). The present study suggests that inhalation of TIS and GM are deemed exhibiting favorable profile across various outcomes for treating chronic <i>P. aeruginosa</i> infection in patients with CF and NCFB, respectively. Further large-scale and higher-quality studies are needed to support the conclusion."

In this longitudinal, retrospective study, we assessed the psychosocial wellbeing of lung transplant recipients during the COVID-19 pandemic at 2 different time points (before and after COVID-19 vaccination). We measured wellbeing with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (cutoff of 11 points indicated anxiety and depression) and the Symptom Checklist consisting of 9 questions. Our study included 83 patients (mean age 52.4 ± 14.5 years, 55.4% male). Among the patients, 3.8% and 4.8% of patients with cystic fibrosis had abnormal values for anxiety before and after the vaccine, respectively; abnormal values for depression were shown in 0% and 2.4% of patients with cystic fibrosis before and after the vaccine, respectively. Sex, age, level of education, time since transplant, and chronic allograft dysfunction were not significantly associated with psychosocial wellbeing. Vaccination against COVID-19 was not associated with a change in psychosocial wellbeing. We found no evidence that the COVID-19 vaccine affected the psychosocial wellbeing of lung transplant recipients.

We aimed to assess its ability to predict liver transplantation (LT) over a 5-year follow-up. We retrospectively included PSC-diagnosed patients under 18 years of age from two European tertiary-care centers. The SCOPE index was calculated at diagnosis and at 1, 3, and 5 years post-diagnosis. The ability of the SCOPE index to predict LT was assessed using multivariate Cox regression and ROC curve analysis. Sixty patients were included.

Previous incision and drainage of the postauricular abscesses yielded little long-term success. Medical history was otherwise unremarkable. Physical examination revealed a cystic mass in the right ear and postauricular fibrosis, likely a result of previous surgical interventions. An audiogram revealed asymmetric hearing function, with mild-to-moderate conductive hearing loss in the left ear contrasting normal hearing in the right ear, while tympanometry confirmed an intact right tympanic membrane but was precluded on the left due to purulent otorrhea. A head CT scan revealed postauricular soft tissue swelling and well-pneumatized mastoid air cells. Both ears were explored intraoperatively via postauricular incisions. Surgical excision included removal of a cyst, cartilaginous remnants, and fibrotic tissue. The patient was followed up to assess for postsurgical complications. The surgical site healed uneventfully; no new symptoms or recurrences of past symptoms of otorrhea, cyst formation, or abscesses had developed within the twelve weeks post-surgery.

Musculoskeletal complications, affecting both peripheral and respiratory muscles, are major concerns in CF patients. Inflammatory cytokines seem to be responsible for the activation of the molecular pathways involved in the imbalance between protein synthesis and catabolism, with consequent loss of muscle mass and function. This study aims to assess the effects of amino acid supplements on functional status, muscle mass and strength, inflammation, and quality of life in adult CF patients. <b>Methods:</b> We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot trial with 60 adult CF patients, aged 18 or older. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either amino acid supplementation or a placebo for 4 weeks. Physical function tests and self-assessment questionnaires on quality of life, global health, and sleep status, as well as blood samples to measure pro-inflammatory cytokines, were performed at baseline and after the treatment period. <b>Results:</b> The amino acid supplementation group showed a significant improvement in self-perceived physical performance and health status. Interleukin-6 serum levels were significantly reduced in this group compared to those who received the placebo (<i>p</i> = 0.042). <b>Conclusions:</b> Amino acid supplementation in adult CF patients improves self-perception of health status and may reduce systemic inflammation, significantly decreasing serum levels of Interleukin-6.

    "title": "Chronic Kidney Disease After Lung Transplantation in Spain: A Retrospective Single-Center Analysis.",
    "abstract": "<b>Objectives</b>: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) among lung transplant (LTx) recipients has increased in recent decades. However, there is insufficient evidence regarding clinical outcomes, and current guidelines lack specific recommendations for its management. <b>Methods</b>: This single-center retrospective study included all patients who underwent LTx and were subsequently referred to a dedicated nephrology outpatient clinic. Major adverse renal events were defined as a composite event. <b>Results</b>: Eighty LTx recipients with underlying lung disease etiology such as cystic fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or interstitial lung disease were included. The mean time from LTx to first nephrologist evaluation was 4.7 years with an eGFR of 31.7 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>. LTx recipients experienced a 48% reduction in eGFR within the first few months after LTx. Rapid progressors require renal replacement therapy earlier than the slow progressors. Patients requiring dialysis had higher all-cause mortality compared to those who did not require dialysis. <b>Conclusions</b>: Early post-LTx functional impairment appears to be the most significant predictor for CKD progression and the eventual need for RRT. Although CNI toxicity is the most common cause of CKD, early nephrology evaluation can uncover other causes and promote early renoprotective measures. For this patient population, specific guidelines addressing CKD after LTx and a multidisciplinary approach are essential."

    "title": "Mechanisms of Endometrioma-Mediated Ovarian Damage: Myths and Facts.",
    "abstract": "Ovarian endometriomas (OEMs), cystic formations within the ovaries, are a significant manifestation of endometriosis and present in 20-40% of affected women. Despite extensive research, the pathogenesis of endometriosis remains unclear, with retrograde menstruation, coelomic metaplasia, and lymphatic dissemination being proposed mechanisms. OEMs negatively impact ovarian function by reducing the ovarian reserve, disrupting folliculogenesis, and altering the ovarian microenvironment through oxidative stress, inflammation, and fibrosis. Elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) accelerate follicular atresia, and extracellular matrix remodeling contributes to ovarian damage, while immune dysregulation and cytokine imbalances further exacerbate the condition. The presence of OEMs does not significantly affect live birth rates in in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatments, despite potential reductions in the quality and quantity of oocytes. However, their surgical excision compromises the ovarian reserve. This review highlights the complex mechanisms by which OEMs impair ovarian function and emphasizes the need for further research to develop strategies that mitigate these effects, ultimately improving reproductive outcomes for women with endometriomas."

Currently, no validated mouse model exists to study disease mechanisms, indicating an important research gap. We aimed at establishing a reproducible mouse model of non-eosinophilic CRS to allow further research on its pathophysiology. Mice were infected with relevant bacteria for sinus disease via surgical insertion of a nasal tampon in their nasal cavity. Inflammatory features in sinus mucosa were evaluated after 4, 8 and 12 weeks on decalcified skulls by histology and immunohistochemistry and by cytospins and enzyme-linked immunoassay on nasal lavage. S. aureus-inoculated mice showed better survival than S. pneumoniae- and P. aeruginosa- inoculated mice. S. aureus and, to lesser extent, P. aeruginosa were still detectable in the nasal lavage up to 12 weeks. Mice with S. aureus and P. aeruginosa-induced CRS showed significant hypertrophia of the epithelium, neutrophilic infiltration and fibrosis in the sinus mucosa, with increased non-Type 2 cytokines in the nasal lavage. S. aureus and P. aeruginosa are more potent inducers of neutrophilic inflammation than S. pneumoniae in mice. This model allows us to further study non-eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitis pathophysiology in vivo."

A 48-year-old male with asthma and a history of Guillain-Barré syndrome presented with cough, chest pain, dyspnea, and weight loss. He was diagnosed with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis after a series of investigations, including CT scans and bronchoscopy. Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is a rare lung disease caused by an immune reaction to <i>Aspergillus fungi</i> in individuals with pre-existing respiratory conditions like asthma or cystic fibrosis. The primary treatment for ABPA involves systemic corticosteroids, often combined with antifungal agents, to reduce the need for long-term high-dose steroid therapy. This case highlights the need for accurate and early diagnosis of ABPA, especially in patients with asthma or other respiratory diseases, which helps prevent potential complications. Additionally, the case provides valuable insights into how to manage patients with ABPA, contributing to the improvement of protocols and medical care in the future."

    "abstract": "Fibrosis is a key feature of a broad spectrum of cystic kidney diseases, especially autosomal recessive kidney disorders such as nephronophthisis (NPHP). However, its contribution to kidney function decline and the underlying molecular mechanism(s) remains unclear. Here, we show that kidney-specific deletion of Fbxw7, the recognition receptor of the SCF<sup>FBW7</sup> E3 ubiquitin ligase, results in a juvenile-adult NPHP-like pathology characterized by slow-progressing corticomedullary cysts, tubular degeneration, severe fibrosis, and gradual loss of kidney function. Expression levels of SOX9, a known substrate of FBW7, and WNT4, a potent pro-fibrotic factor and downstream effector of SOX9, were elevated upon loss of FBW7. Heterozygous deletion of Sox9 in compound mutant mice led to the normalization of WNT4 levels, reduced fibrosis, and preservation of kidney function without significant effects on cystic dilatation and tubular degeneration. These data suggest that FBW7-SOX9-WNT4-induced fibrosis drives kidney function decline in NPHP and, possibly, other forms of autosomal recessive kidney disorders."

This study aimed to identify factors associated with the development of ABPA in pwCF, using data from the French CF Registry (FCFR). We conducted a multicenter case-control study utilizing anonymized data from the FCFR, spanning the period from 2016 to 2021. A total of 312 ABPA cases were matched to 936 controls. Various clinical factors, including CFTR variants, nutritional status, glucose disorders, respiratory function, chronic bacterial colonization, and treatments such as antibiotics, corticosteroids, and antifungals, were analyzed. Multivariate analyses and logistic regression models were used to identify associations with ABPA. PwCF who received more frequent intravenous antibiotics (OR = 2.47, P = .013), long-term inhaled corticosteroids (OR = 1.82, P < .001), or antifungals (OR = 5.83, P < .0001) exhibited a higher likelihood of developing ABPA. Additionally, glucose disorders were significantly associated with ABPA (OR = 1.41, P = .03). In contrast, a higher body mass index (BMI >25 kg/m²) appeared to be a protective factor (OR = 0.47, P = .03). No significant associations were observed with lung function, CFTR variants, or chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization. These findings suggest that certain clinical factors and treatments, particularly glucose disorders, frequent antibiotic use, and corticosteroid therapy, are associated with the development of ABPA in pwCF. Notably, a higher BMI may have a protective effect. Further research is needed to explore the underlying mechanisms of these associations and optimize treatment strategies for ABPA in CF, especially as CF therapies continue to evolve."

Secondary and other efficacy endpoints included absolute changes from parent study baseline in sweat chloride concentration, LCI<sub>2.5</sub>, ppFEV<sub>1</sub>, and CFQ-R respiratory domain score. A total of 120 children were enrolled and dosed. One hundred and eighteen children (98.3%) had adverse events (AEs), which for most were mild (43.3%) or moderate (48.3%) in severity.

Response of HNECs to CFTR modulators was assessed by CFTR-mediated chloride current stimulated by forskolin or inhibited by CFTRinh-172 in both pwCF and healthy controls. Clinical response was defined as change in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV<sub>1</sub>), lung clearance index (LCI), sweat chloride or respiratory domain of the Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R) between baseline and within 3 months after the start of modulator treatment. In 58 unique <i>in vitro</i>-clinical pairs, <i>in vitro</i> measures of functional rescue correlated with changes in FEV<sub>1</sub>, LCI and sweat chloride, but not CFQ-R.

    "abstract": "Radiation enteritis is one of the most frequent clinical complications of radiotherapy (RT), yet few effective strategies currently exist to protect against that. Anoctamin 1 (ANO1) functions both as a chloride channel and a signal transduction protein, influencing numerous pathophysiological processes. This study aimed to investigate whether targeting ANO1 could mitigate radiation-induced enteritis while enhancing tumor radiosensitivity. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) and Western blot (WB) were used to assess ANO1 expression and its changes after irradiation. Survival rates were recorded to evaluate the effects of ANO1 agonist and inhibitors. A cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) inhibitor was administered to irradiated mice to investigate the role of chloride channel in radiation protection. qPCR and WB were executed to analyze the expression of relevant ion channels in intestinal epithelium. Functional validation was conducted using inhibitors in mice and 3D organoids. Fluorescent probe kits detected intracellular ion levels and membrane potential, and WB was performed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Finally, the radiosensitizing effect of CaCCinh-A01 was assessed in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells and validated in in vivo models. Blocking the calcium-activated chloride channel (CaCC) protein ANO1, which is highly expressed in the colon, protects the intestine from radiation-induced damage. The ANO1 inhibitor CaCCinh-A01, suppresses CaCC currents, downregulates ANO1 protein expression, alleviates radiation-induced intestine injury, and enhances the radiosensitivity of CRC. Mechanistically, CaCCinh-A01 upregulates Na-K-Cl Cotransporter 1 (NKCC1) protein expression, leading to an increase in intracellular Cl<sup>-</sup> concentration and the inhibition of membrane depolarization in MODE-K cells. This subsequently inhibits p53-mediate DNA damage signaling, ultimately alleviating ionizing radiation-induced intestinal injury. These findings suggest that targeting ANO1 not only alleviates radiation-induced intestinal injury in mice but also enhances CRC radiosensitivity. Thus, ANO1 represents a promising therapeutic target for mitigating the side effects of RT in CRC patients."

    "abstract": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a complex genetic disorder necessitating extensive treatment regimens leading to significant medication burden. The recent use of modulator therapies have questioned the necessity of traditional CF treatments, prompting re-evaluation of strategies to reduce treatment burden. This study aimed to identify the barriers and enablers to deprescribing from the perspectives of doctors, nurses, and pharmacists caring for people with CF (PwCF). A qualitative study design employing semi-structured interviews was utilised. Healthcare practitioners (HCPs) across Australia were recruited and interviewed. Interviews were transcribed and analysed using NVivo 1.3 software, guided by an existing framework focusing on self-efficacy, feasibility, inertia, and awareness. Eleven HCP participated (doctors, n = 3, nurses, n = 4, pharmacists, n = 4). Low self-efficacy was the most prominent barrier to deprescribing, founded on a perceived lack of evidence. Feasibility was an enabler when patient factors were present, particularly PwCF's experiences of reducing medications independently. Likewise, the presence of pharmacists in CF clinics and multidisciplinary team meetings were identified as facilitators. Inertia to continue entrenched prescribing habits and fear of adverse outcomes deterred deprescribing. Similarly, HCPs reported having little awareness of the need for deprescribing in daily practice, as their primary focus was on addressing acute problems. Enhancing self-efficacy through evidence-based guidelines and increasing feasibility by fostering collaborative approaches among HCPs and PwCF may improve deprescribing practices in CF care. As evidence on the benefits and safety of deprescribing grows, it should be integrated into clinical guidelines to alleviate medication burden and improve quality of life for PwCF."

Patients with chILD <18 years who underwent LuTx at our center between January 1, 2011 and September 30, 2023 were retrospectively analyzed and divided into 2 groups depending on their age at disease manifestation: children in the chILD A group predominantly became ill during the first 2 years of life, chILD B patients thereafter. Outcomes were compared to patients with CF and PH. One hundred and one children were included (chILD A 12; chILD B 19; CF 49; PH 21). Patients in the chILD A group were younger (mean age 1.5 vs 12.9, 15.2, 10.9 years) and frequently required mechanical ventilation before LuTx (41.7% vs 10.5%, 2%, 9.5%, respectively). Their median intensive care unit (ICU) stay (23 vs 4, 2, 13 days) and median hospital stay (48 vs 27, 30, 42 days) after LuTx were longer. Patients in chILD B had the lowest pretransplant ICU requirement (21.1% vs 66.7% for chILD A, 30.6% for CF, and 47.6% for PH) and short median hospital stay. Five-year survival was comparable in all groups (80.2%, 86.5%, 80.4%, and 81.2%).

Given the potential for life-long ELX/TEZ/IVA use, long-term safety and efficacy of ELX/TEZ/IVA was assessed. In this phase 3, open-label, single-arm extension study, participants with <i>F508del</i>-minimal function genotypes (from 24-week parent study 445-102 [n = 399]) or with the <i>F508del-F508del</i> genotype (from 4-week parent study 445-103 [n = 107]) received ELX/TEZ/IVA (ELX 200 mg once daily, TEZ 100 mg once daily, and IVA 150 mg every 12 hours) over 192 weeks. Primary endpoint was safety and tolerability. Mean exposure to ELX/TEZ/IVA was 172.6 weeks. Most participants had adverse events classified as mild (12.8%) or moderate (60.7%) in severity. Eighteen participants (3.6%) had adverse events that led to treatment discontinuation. After starting ELX/TEZ/IVA, participants had consistent increases in percent predicted FEV<sub>1</sub> (ppFEV<sub>1</sub>), Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised respiratory domain score, and body mass index, with decreases in sweat chloride concentration and pulmonary exacerbations rates; these improvements were maintained through 192 weeks. The mean annualized rate of change in ppFEV<sub>1</sub> was 0.02 percentage points (95% CI, -0.14 to 0.19) after initiation of ELX/TEZ/IVA. During this 192-week open label extension study, the longest clinical study of a CFTR modulator to date, ELX/TEZ/IVA remained generally safe and well-tolerated. Participants had sustained improvements in lung function, respiratory symptoms, CFTR function, pulmonary exacerbation rates, and nutritional status. The estimated annualized rate of change in ppFEV<sub>1</sub> suggests no evidence of pulmonary function loss across the study population over the 4-year treatment period.

TMEM16A is also expressed in epithelium of intestine with a minor contributor to transepithelial fluid secretion, while other unidentified Ca<sup>2+</sup> -activated Cl - channels (unCaCCs) are mainly responsible for this physiological process. TMEM16A/CaCCs dysfunction can lead to disorders of intestinal motility and transepithelial fluid secretion. TMEM16A/CaCCs regulators are important tools to identify unCaCCs and study the physiopathological functions related to TMEM16A/CaCCs. In the present study, coumarins were identified as TMEM16A inhibitors in a concentration- and time-dependent manner in TMEM16A-expressed Fischer rat thyroid (FRT) epithelial cells. Coumarins attenuated intestinal motility by inhibiting TMEM16A <i>in vivo</i> and <i>ex vivo</i>. Coumarins inhibited CaCCs-mediated Cl<sup>-</sup> currents induced by ATP in T84 and HT-29 cells or by carbachol (CCh) in mouse colonic mucosa with reduction of ATP-induced increase of cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration in HT-29 cells. Coumarins inhibited basolateral Ca<sup>2+</sup> -activated K<sup>+</sup> channels without affecting Na + /K + -ATPase activity in mouse colonic mucosa. Coumarins did not show inhibition of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), but mild activation of CFTR-mediated Cl - currents under the low concentration forskolin (FSK) in CFTR-expressed FRT cells, while coumarins did not activate CFTR-mediated Cl- currents in mouse colonic mucosa. This study was the first to demonstrate that coumarins attenuate intestinal motility by inhibiting TMEM16A, which may provide a strategy for clinical drug intervention aimed at reducing secretory diarrhea."

This study aimed to investigate the molecular epidemiology of P. aeruginosa in CF patients from the Brazilian Amazon, focusing on genotypic diversity, resistance profiles, and virulence factors. A cross-sectional study included 72 P. aeruginosa isolates from 44 CF patients treated at a regional reference center between 2018 and 2019. Antimicrobial susceptibility patterns were determined using VITEK-2 system and Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion. Virulotypes were defined by molecular detection of exoS, exoU, exoT, exoY, algU, and algD genes. Genetic diversity was assessed using multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Demographic data, clinical severity, and spirometry results were also collected. Among the patients, 54.55% experienced intermittent infections, while 45.45% had chronic infections. Chronic infections were associated with older age, lower FEV1, and reduced Shwachman-Kulczycki scores. Multidrug resistance was observed in 15.3% of isolates, particularly against ciprofloxacin and piperacillin/tazobactam. The exoU gene was present in 55.56% of isolates, an uncommon finding in CF populations. High genetic diversity was evident, with 37 sequence types (STs), including 14 novel STs. High-risk clones (HRCs) constituted 25% of isolates, with ST274 being the most prevalent (12.5%). Longitudinal analysis revealed transient colonization in intermittent infections, while chronic infections were dominated by stable clones. This study highlights the molecular and clinical dynamics of P. aeruginosa in CF patients from the Brazilian Amazon. Chronic infections were linked to severe lung impairment , while intermittent infections were dominated by HRCs. These findings underscore the need for robust genotypic surveillance to mitigate the burden of P. aeruginosa in CF populations."

However, further efforts are needed to maximize therapeutic benefits as well as to increase the number of PwCF taking CFTR modulators. The authors discuss some of the key limitations of the currently available CFTR modulator therapies (e.g. adverse reactions) and strategies in development to increase the number of available therapeutics for CF. These include novel methods to accelerate theratyping and identification of novel small molecules and cellular targets representing alternative or complementary therapies for CF. While the CF therapy development pipeline continues to grow, there is a critical need to optimize strategies that will accelerate testing and approval of effective therapies for (ultra)rare CFTR variants as traditional assays and trials are not suitable to address such issues. Another major barrier that needs to be solved is the restricted access to currently available modulator therapies, which remains a significant burden for PwCF who are from racial and ethnic minorities and/or living in underprivileged regions."

    "abstract": "<i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> is one of the major drivers of morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic underlying diseases. Whereas cystic fibrosis (CF) <i>P. aeruginosa</i> strains have been well studied, non-CF bronchiectasis isolates have received less scientific attention. We determined the antibiotic susceptibility profiles of a collection of 100 <i>P. aeruginosa</i> isolates recovered from a total of 100 non-CF bronchiectasis patients attending a Catalonian hospital. All carbapenemase-producing isolates were characterized by WGS. Twelve isolates were classified as MDR (12%) and six were found to be carbapenemase (VIM-2) producers (6%). Of note, two of the VIM-2-producing isolates were carbapenem susceptible due to the presence of inactivating mutations in MexAB-OprM efflux pump components. These isolates exhibited properties of chronic <i>P. aeruginosa</i> isolates, such as mutator or mucoid phenotypes that are associated with persistent infections despite intensive antibiotic therapies. The phylogenetic analysis evidenced that all VIM-2 isolates belonged to the high-risk clone ST235. Core-genome MLST analysis revealed 7-260 allelic differences, arguing against recent transmission but a common source of infection or an ancient interpatient transmission event could not be ruled out. Altogether, these findings suggest that <i>P. aeruginosa</i> chronic respiratory infections can be an important and silent reservoir of transferable resistance determinants and <i>P. aeruginosa</i> high-risk clones, thus contributing to their increased resistance and worldwide dissemination."

    "abstract": "To assess the impact of combining positive expiratory pressure (PEP) and nebulisation on lung delivery by measuring the urinary concentration of amikacin, used as a biomarker in people with cystic fibrosis. Randomised crossover study. Nine people with cystic fibrosis. A solution of amikacin was nebulised using a nebuliser alone or a nebuliser in combination with a PEP device. After nebulisation, urine samples were collected over 24 hours. The total amount of amikacin excreted in urine was calculated, reflecting the lung dose. The elimination rate constant was also calculated, and represents total drug elimination by excretion and metabolism. No differences in lung dose, half-life or elimination rate constant were observed between the two methods of nebulisation. Lung dose divided by respiratory rate was significantly greater for nebulisation in combination with PEP. The use of nebulisation in combination with PEP does not result in clinically significant improvements in drug delivery in people with mild-to-moderate cystic fibrosis. However, this combination can be used safely to reduce the duration of physiotherapy sessions without compromising drug delivery. NCT02535130. CONTRIBUTION OF THE PAPER."

Here, we describe trial conduct, patient characteristics, and patient-reported symptoms at baseline among patients enrolled in ARISE. Adult patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent non-cavitary MACLD who had not initiated antibiotic treatment for their current MAC infection were enrolled; data including comorbidities and prior MACLD history were collected during screening. Symptom burden was assessed using QOL-B, PROMIS F SF-7a, and Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT) questionnaires. Of 99 patients from 12 countries enrolled in ARISE, the median age was 69.0 years; most were white (80.8%) and female (77.8%). This was the first diagnosis of MACLD for 72.7% of patients. Patients frequently reported having a comorbid respiratory disorder: bronchiectasis (49.5%), asthma (21.2%), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (16.2%). At baseline, mean (± SD) and median QOL-B RD scores were 65.0 (± 15.3) and 66.7; PROMIS F SF-7a T-scores were 53.8 (± 8.2) and 55.1; and FACIT-Fatigue scores were 35.0 (± 9.6) and 37.0. Patients in ARISE were representative of a real-world patient population with MACLD. Comorbid chronic respiratory diseases were common in patients with new or recurrent MACLD, and substantial disease burden at the time physicians initiated MACLD treatment was evidenced by impairment across measures of fatigue and QOL-B domains.

    "title": "Pathogen Partnerships or Power Struggles? Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus Dynamics in Cystic Fibrosis.",
    "abstract": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a polymicrobial infection characterized by interactions among various bacterial species that affect one another's cohabitation. The investigation of interspecies interactions in dual infections is essential to understand their reaction in the environment better and assist in the development of treatment regimens and innovative disease control approaches. Our hypothesis posits that co-infection interactions promote the adaptation of Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, potentially leading to synergistic action. To explore this, we examined dual-species interactions in co-isolated pairs of these organisms from Egyptian CF patients using laboratory media and artificial sputum media (ASM). Based on demographic data, 82 collected bacterial isolates from single, dual, and triple cultures were identified from 50 enrolled patients. In the interaction of the pairs in mimic media, P. aeruginosa exo-products significantly enhanced the biofilm formation and growth of S. aureus. Conversely, S. aureus did not inhibit P. aeruginosa biofilm formation. Furthermore, the biofilm mode of dual-organism growth provides protection in the CF context, as bacterial biofilms can withstand much higher antimicrobial levels compared to planktonically grown bacteria. Additionally, key biofilm genes regulated by quorum sensing were differentially expressed in both species in an isolate-dependent manner, highlighting their significant role in coexistence dual-species biofilm coexistence. In conclusion, our study illuminates the competitive and cooperative interactions between these two pathogens, which impact their coexistence and encourage biofilm production. This, in turn, accelerates disease progression and compromises patient health."

    "abstract": "<i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> is a Gram-negative opportunistic pathogen that poses a significant public health threat, particularly in healthcare settings. A key determinant of <i>P. aeruginosa</i> virulence is the regulated synthesis and release of extracellular products, which is controlled by a cell density-dependent signaling system known as quorum sensing (QS). <i>P. aeruginosa</i> uses a complex QS network, including two systems that rely on diffusible N-acylhomoserine lactone (AHL) signal molecules. The LuxR-type receptor RhlR is unique in that it requires not only its cognate AHL but also the accessory protein PqsE to maximally bind to promoter DNA and initiate transcription. Our group previously demonstrated that PqsE physically interacts with RhlR, enhancing its affinity for target promoters across the <i>P. aeruginosa</i> genome. Although LuxR-type receptors are widespread in Gram-negative bacteria and important for pathogenesis, PqsE orthologs are restricted to <i>Pseudomonas</i> and <i>Burkholderia</i> species. This study explored the conservation of PqsE and examined PqsE ortholog structure-function across different species. Our results show that PqsE in <i>Pseudomonas</i> retains their functional interactions with RhlR homologs, unlike PqsE orthologs in <i>Burkholderia</i> spp., which do not interact with their respective LuxR-type receptors. Additionally, we assessed the AHL preferences of different receptors and hypothesized that the PqsE-RhlR interaction evolved to stabilize the inherently unstable RhlR, preventing its degradation. Indeed, we observe higher levels of RhlR protein turnover in a strain lacking <i>pqsE</i> compared to a wild-type strain of PA14, which can be partially rescued in a strain of <i>P. aeruginosa</i> lacking the Lon protease. <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, a major pathogen for patients with cystic fibrosis and a primary constituent of healthcare-associated infections, relies on a complex quorum-sensing (QS) network to coordinate virulence factor production. Central to this system is the interaction between two proteins, PqsE and RhlR, which drive gene expression essential for pathogenesis. Our study investigates the conservation of the PqsE-RhlR interaction across related bacterial species, revealing that PqsE in <i>Pseudomonas</i> can enhance RhlR activity, while orthologs in <i>Burkholderia</i> lack this capacity. These findings offer new insights into the specificity and evolution of QS mechanisms, highlighting the PqsE-RhlR interaction as a potentially selective target for treating <i>P. aeruginosa</i> infections."

    "abstract": "<i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> (PA) causes severe respiratory infections utilizing multiple virulence functions. Our previous findings on <i>PA</i> quorum sensing (QS)-regulated small molecule, 2'-aminoacetophenone (2-AA), secreted by the bacteria in infected tissues, revealed its effect on immune and metabolic functions favouring a long-term presence of <i>PA</i> in the host. However, studies on 2-AA's specific effects on bronchial-airway epithelium and pulmonary endothelium remain elusive. To evaluate 2AA's spatiotemporal changes in the human airway, considering endothelial cells as the first point of contact when the route of lung infection is hematogenic, we utilized the microfluidic airway-on-chip lined by polarized human bronchial-airway epithelium and pulmonary endothelium. Using this platform, we performed RNA-sequencing to analyse responses of 2-AA-treated primary human pulmonary microvascular endothelium (HPMEC) and adjacent primary normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells from healthy female donors and potential cross-talk between these cells. Analyses unveiled specific signaling and biosynthesis pathways to be differentially regulated by 2-AA in epithelial cells, including HIF-1 and pyrimidine signaling, glycosaminoglycan, and glycosphingolipid biosynthesis, while in endothelial cells were fatty acid metabolism, phosphatidylinositol and estrogen receptor signaling, and proinflammatory signaling pathways. Significant overlap in both cell types in response to 2-AA was found in genes implicated in immune response and cellular functions. In contrast, we found that genes related to barrier permeability, cholesterol metabolism, and oxidative phosphorylation were differentially regulated upon exposure to 2-AA in the cell types studied. Murine <i>in-vivo</i> and additional <i>in vitro</i> cell culture studies confirmed cholesterol accumulation in epithelial cells. Results also revealed specific biomarkers associated with cystic fibrosis and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis to be modulated by 2-AA in both cell types, with the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator expression to be affected only in endothelial cells. The 2-AA-mediated effects on healthy epithelial and endothelial primary cells within a microphysiological dynamic environment mimicking the human lung airway enhance our understanding of this QS signaling molecule. This study provides novel insights into their functions and potential interactions, paving the way for innovative, cell-specific therapeutic strategies to combat <i>PA</i> lung infections."

This study aimed to explore gender equality in attendance at doctor's appointments among caregivers of children with chronic diseases before and after the introduction of video conference visits. Children aged 0-17 years diagnosed with cystic fibrosis, inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes or a chronic neurological disease at Gothenburg's and Lund's paediatric hospitals were included. Data on caregiver attendance from 2019 to 2022 were retrospectively collected from medical records. Doctors' appointments were categorised as in-person, telephone or video conference visits. Using mixed-effects models, we evaluated trends in parental attendance and assessed the associations between different types of appointments and gender equality in healthcare. A total of 347 participants were included between 2019 and 2022, resulting in 6134 appointments. Overall attendance rates were 74% for mothers and 44% for fathers, corresponding to a difference of 30%-points (95% CI 27% to 32%-points, p<0.001). Mothers had consistently higher attendance rates across all types of appointments (all p<0.05). The attendance gap between mothers and fathers remained similar over time, except for video conference visits where an increase in maternal attendance was observed (p<0.001) while paternal attendance remained constant (p=0.90). Video conference visits had higher joint attendance rates than in-person and telephone appointments (both p<0.001). Mothers attended paediatric outpatient visits more frequently than fathers across all appointment types. The gender gap in attendance remained unchanged after the introduction of video conference visits, while the joint attendance increased. Future interventions should explore structural strategies to enhance gender equality in caregiver attendance."

    "abstract": "<i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> is a prevalent opportunistic Gram-negative bacterial pathogen. One of its key virulence factors is pyocyanin, a redox-active phenazine secondary metabolite that plays a crucial role in the establishment and persistence of chronic infections. This review provides a synopsis of the mechanisms through which pyocyanin exacerbates pulmonary infections. Pyocyanin induces oxidative stress by generating reactive oxygen and nitrogen species which disrupt essential defense mechanisms in respiratory epithelium. Pyocyanin increases airway barrier permeability and facilitates bacterial invasion. Pyocyanin also impairs mucociliary clearance by damaging ciliary function, resulting in mucus accumulation and airway obstruction. Furthermore, it modulates immune responses by promoting the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, accelerating neutrophil apoptosis, and inducing excessive neutrophil extracellular trap formation, which exacerbates lung tissue damage. Additionally, pyocyanin disrupts macrophage phagocytic function, hindering the clearance of apoptotic cells and perpetuating inflammation. It also triggers mucus hypersecretion by inactivating the transcription factor FOXA2 and enhancing the IL-4/IL-13-STAT6 and EGFR-AKT/ERK1/2 signaling pathways, leading to goblet cell metaplasia and increased mucin production. Insights into the role of pyocyanin in <i>P. aeruginosa</i> infections may reveal potential therapeutic strategies to alleviate the severity of infections in chronic respiratory diseases including cystic fibrosis (CF) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)."

It empowers scientists with the ability to effect precise genetic modifications, thereby potentially paving the way for advanced treatments for genetic disorders such as Huntington's disease, hemophilia, and cystic fibrosis. Yet, the significant capabilities of this technology also brings to the fore a myriad of intricate bioethical, legal, and regulatory dilemmas. In light of these complexities, this article endeavors to conduct a comprehensive scoping review of the existing literature on the most significant ethical implications emanating from genome editing. In conducting this review, we utilized the power of software tools like EndNote and Rayyan to aid in the systematic and thorough review of the literature. EndNote, a reference management software, was instrumental in organizing and managing the references and bibliographies, while Rayyan, a web application designed for managing and screening records for systematic and scoping reviews, proved crucial in the import and management of text records for the review.The review identified as main aspects of ethical, bioethical and medico-legal interest the exacerbation of social inequalities, safety concerns such as off-target mutations and immunological risks, ecological and evolutionary implications, and challenges to human dignity. It highlights the necessity for equitable access, rigorous regulation, and public engagement to address these issues responsibly.The ultimate objective of this article is to underscore the importance of an informed and inclusive dialogue regarding genome editing. Such dialogue is pivotal for fostering responsible innovation in this rapidly advancing field, ensuring that scientific progress aligns with ethical considerations. By presenting a comprehensive examination of the ethical implications of genome editing, we aim to contribute to this ongoing dialogue and promote a balanced and nuanced understanding of this impactful technology."

Its application in rare disease (RD) drug development is promising, given the genetic basis of many RDs and the need for precision medicine approaches. Despite significant advancements, challenges persist in developing effective therapies for RDs due to small patient populations, genetic heterogeneity, and limited surrogate biomarkers. The Orphan Drug Act in the U.S. has incentivized RD drug development. However, the traditional drug approval process is constrained by logistical and economic challenges, necessitating innovative PGx-driven strategies. Identifying genetic biomarkers in the early drug development stages can optimize dose selection, enhance therapeutic efficacy, and reduce ADRs. Case studies such as eliglustat for Gaucher disease and ivacaftor for cystic fibrosis demonstrate the efficacy of PGx-guided treatment strategies. Integrating PGx into global drug development requires the harmonization of regulatory policies and increased diversity in genetic research. Artificial intelligence (AI) tools further enhance genetic analysis, disease prediction, and clinical decision-making. Modernizing drug labeling with PGx information is critical to ensuring safe and effective drug use. Collectively, PGx offers transformative potential in RD therapeutics by facilitating personalized medicine approaches and addressing unmet medical needs."

    "abstract": "The cystic fibrosis (CF) causing variant G542X harbours a premature translation stop signal in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) mRNA. This results in nonsense-mediated decay and loss of functional CFTR protein which leads to defective anion transport and the development of CF disease pathology. Currently available CF modulator therapies cannot be used to treat this variant. We used an adenine base editor (ABE8e Cas9) and guide RNA (sgRNA)/enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) plasmids encapsulated in receptor targeted nanoparticles (RTN), delivered to Bmi-1 transduced basal human CF nasal epithelial cells harbouring the homozygous CFTR G542X variant, to convert the stop codon to G542R, a variant which is amenable to modulator therapy. ABE resulted in 17% of alleles edited to G542R and further selection of GFP fluorescent cells by FACS liberated a population with 52% G542R edited alleles with no editing of neighbouring adenines (A) and few off target edits using a gRNA homology-based approach. In cells differentiated at air-liquid-interface (ALI), 17% and 52% editing of CFTR G542X increased mRNA abundance. 52% editing alone or 17% and 52% editing of CFTR G542X plus treatment with CFTR modulators (VX-445/VX-661/VX-770; ETI/Trikafta/Kaftrio) increased epithelial CFTR protein expression, CFTR protein band C abundance, CFTR<sub>172</sub> inhibitable anion transport, and changes in airway surface liquid height and pH in response to vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) stimulation. Epithelial scratch repair speed and directionality was also improved. These data provide proof-of-concept that ABE of G542X to G542R in human CF airway epithelial cells could provide a feasible therapy for this variant."

Statements were completed in a 3-step process: the questions were identified via an anonymous online survey, followed by a comprehensive literature search, and a final Delphi process. The guidance recommends the use of ultra-low dose CT scans (effective radiation dose, 0.08 mSv; equivalent to 2 to 4 chest X-rays), tracking of patients' cumulative radiation and effective communication strategies using \"de-medicalized\" information for shared decision making. Chest CT scans (with lung volume monitoring) are not recommended systematically in both children and adults.

In a multicentric prospective study, children with recurrent/persistent pneumonia, failure to thrive, or steatorrhea with suspicion of CF were enrolled. Sweat chloride concentration was measured to confirm the diagnosis of CF. Diagnostic accuracy of various clinical features, ancillary laboratory investigations (serum electrolytes, blood gas, stool fat globules), and aquagenic wrinkling for CF diagnosis was estimated. CF clinical diagnostic score (CF-CDS) was developed by combining significant parameters in stepwise logistic regression. Of 860 children enrolled, 313 (36.7 %) were diagnosed with CF. History of a sibling with CF, clubbing, hyponatremia, metabolic alkalosis, stool fat globule positivity, sputum Pseudomonas isolation, and aquagenic wrinkling within 3 min were found to be independently associated with a diagnosis of CF. CF-CDS score developed by combining these parameters demonstrated excellent diagnostic accuracy for diagnosis of CF [AUROC of 0.923 (95 %CI: 0.899, 0.946)]. At a cut-off of ≥2.5, CF-CDS had sensitivity and specificity of 87.64 % and 81.02 %, respectively. CF-CDS has excellent diagnostic accuracy for diagnosis of CF in children and can be used to decide on starting treatment of CF pending confirmatory tests when confirmatory tests are not readily available."

    "abstract": "Virulent bacteriophages (or phages) are viruses that specifically infect and lyse a bacterial host. When multiple phages co-infect a bacterial host, the extent of lysis and dynamics of bacteria-phage and phage-phage interactions are expected to vary. The objective of this study is to identify the factors influencing the interaction of two virulent phages with different Pseudomonas aeruginosa growth states (planktonic, an infected epithelial cell line, and biofilm) by measuring the bacterial time-kill and individual phage replication kinetics. A single administration of phages effectively reduced P. aeruginosa viability in planktonic conditions and infected human lung cell cultures, but phage-resistant variants subsequently emerged. In static biofilms, the phage combination displayed initial inhibition of biofilm dispersal, but sustained control was achieved only by combining phages and the meropenem antibiotic. In contrast, adherent biofilms showed tolerance to phage and/or meropenem, suggesting a spatio-temporal variation in the phage-bacterial interaction. The kinetics of adsorption of each phage to P. aeruginosa during single or co-administration were comparable. However, the phage with the shorter lysis time depleted bacterial resources early and selected a specific nucleotide polymorphism that conferred a competitive disadvantage and cross-resistance to the second phage. The extent and strength of this phage-phage competition and genetic loci conferring phage resistance are, however, P. aeruginosa genotype-dependent. Nevertheless, adding phages sequentially resulted in their unimpeded replication with no significant increase in bacterial host lysis. These results highlight the interrelatedness of phage-phage competition, phage resistance, and specific bacterial growth state (planktonic/biofilm) in shaping the interplay among P. aeruginosa and virulent phages."

    "abstract": "The liver is a common site for metastatic spread, especially in advanced colorectal, breast, and pancreatic cancers. Imaging evaluation of liver metastases after systemic treatments like chemotherapy, targeted therapy, or immunotherapy is essential to distinguish treatment response from disease progression. The widely used response evaluation criteria in solid tumours (RECIST 1.1) focus on lesion size changes to evaluate treatment response. However, newer therapies, mainly targeted therapy and immunotherapy, often induce changes beyond size reduction, such as tumour necrosis, fibrosis, cystic transformation, calcifications, and modifications at the liver-tumour interface. These morphological and enhancement changes can be evaluated on CT and MRI and may better reflect the biological response in specific clinical settings. Overall, RECIST 1.1 criteria are recommended for assessing the radiological response of liver metastases after systemic treatment. The use of alternative radiological criteria validated on CT (such as Chun or Choi criteria) is recommended in specific clinical settings (e.g. metastatic colorectal cancer or metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumours). Additionally, CT and MR modifications that reflect fibrosis, necrosis, calcifications, and haemorrhage can serve as ancillary indicators of tumoural response. These alternative criteria and radiological findings should be systematically assessed, particularly in liver metastases with minimal size changes, to better identify responders. KEY POINTS: RECIST 1.1 is the standard for evaluating tumour response in solid tumours and is recommended for the assessment of liver metastases after systemic therapy. CT attenuation, enhancement, and liver/tumour interface may correlate better with tumoural response compared to size reduction. CT and MR changes suggesting necrosis, fibrosis, calcifications, and haemorrhage can be used as additional indicators of tumoural response."

This study is also very significant in showing that IOS can be performed in young children who are unable to cooperate with spirometry. In contrast, no such differences were noted between CF and healthy controls, possibly due to thick mucus affecting sound wave transmission through the airways in CF. In addition, IOS may be less effective in detecting early pulmonary disease, as in some studies it failed to identify abnormalities in young children with CF even when spirometry is abnormal."

    "title": "Identified five variants in CFTR gene that alter RNA splicing by minigene assay.",
    "abstract": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a common monogenic multisystem disease caused primarily by variants in the CFTR gene. Emerging evidence suggests that some variants, which are described as missense, synonymous or nonsense variants in the literature or databases, may be deleterious by affecting the pre-mRNA splicing process. We analyzed 27 exonic variants in the CFTR gene utilizing bioinformatics tools and identified candidate variants that could lead to splicing changes through minigene assays. Ultimately, we selected eight candidate variants to assess their effects on pre-mRNA splicing. The numbering of DNA variants is based on the complementary DNA (cDNA)sequence of CFTR (Ref Seq NM_000492.4). This study assessed the impact of CFTR variants on exon splicing by combining predictive bioinformatics tools with minigene assays. Among the eight candidate single nucleotide alterations, five variants (c.488A>T,c.1117G>T, c.1209G>T, c.3239A>G and c.3367G>C) were identified as causing exon skipping. Our study employed a minigene system, which offers great flexibility for assessing aberrant splicing patterns when patient mRNA samples are not accessible, to investigate the effects of exonic variants on pre-mRNA splicing. Our experimental outcomes highlight the importance of analyzing exonic variations at the mRNA level."

    "abstract": "Despite recent improvements in treatment modalities for cystic fibrosis (CF), there is currently limited evidence and a lack of consensus regarding optimal treatment strategies for the different aspects of CF, including pulmonary exacerbations (PEx). We aimed to establish a prospective cohort of people with CF (pwCF) to evaluate alternative approaches to managing CF in the era of modulator therapies. We prospectively enrolled children and adults with CF receiving care at specialist CF centres across Australia. Participant data were systematically collected on demography, clinical signs and symptoms, comorbidities, spirometry, participant reported outcomes, microbiology and treatments received. Here we describe the demographic, microbiological and clinical characteristics of the participants at enrolment, to understand the representativeness of the cohort for planning future nested studies. Between October 14, 2020 and December 31, 2023, 927 pwCF were enrolled across eleven Australian CF centres. Of these, 51% (n=472) were male, 77% (n=709) were <18 years old, 90% (n=831) had a highest ppFEV<sub>1</sub> (percent predicted forced expiratory volume exhaled in the first second) of ≥70% in the preceding year, and 35% (n=322) reported detection of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in their airway specimens. We have established a contemporary cohort of pwCF with granular clinical and treatment data for PEx. This cohort will enable future nested studies focused on PEx management and other aspects of CF care. Understanding the baseline characteristics of these participants, as presented here, is critical for interpreting subsequent outcomes and for identifying factors that may influence disease progression and response to therapies."

    "abstract": "Hereditary cystic kidney diseases are ciliopathies characterized by functional defects in the primary cilia of renal tubules. Abnormalities in the primary cilia enhance cell proliferation signals and cause cyst enlargement. The most common type is autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), but other diseases, such as nephronophthisis, have been discovered to be more common than previously considered. In ADPKD, several microRNAs are reportedly aberrantly expressed and involved in disease pathogenesis. Among these, we focused on miR-21, which is upregulated in response to cAMP signaling. In this study, we aimed to newly generate an anti-miR-21 oligonucleotide synthesized from serinol nucleic acid (Anti-miR-21-SNA) to improve anti-miRNA activity and investigate its effects on cyst growth in vivo and in vitro. We evaluated the effectiveness of anti-miR-21 treatment using an SNA-based antisense oligonucleotide in a mouse model of cystic kidney disease and human ADPKD cells. Our study revealed that Anti-miR-21-SNA effectively prevented cyst growth in vivo and in vitro. In the mouse model of cystic kidney disease, we systemically administered Anti-miR-21-SNA and observed its accumulation primarily in the kidneys, suggesting effective drug delivery. Anti-miR-21-SNA treatment reduced kidney size and blood urea nitrogen levels without inducing hepatotoxicity. Mechanistically, molecules related to mitochondrial metabolism, apoptosis, and fibrosis pathways were involved. In vitro, Anti-miR-21-SNA treatment of primary cultured kidney cells from an ADPKD patient reduced cyst volume and intracellular cAMP content and increased Ca2+ concentration, supporting the efficacy of this treatment. Our results showed that Anti-miR-21-SNA treatment represents a potential therapeutic strategy for cystic kidney disease."

    "abstract": "Antibiotic-resistant bacteria of the genus Pandoraea, frequently acquired from the environment, are an emerging cause of opportunistic respiratory infections, especially in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. However, their specialized metabolites, including niche and virulence factors, remained unknown. Through genome mining of environmental and clinical isolates of diverse Pandoraea species, we identified a highly conserved biosynthesis gene cluster (pan) that codes for a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) assembling a new siderophore. Using bioinformatics-guided metabolic profiling of wild type and a targeted null mutant, we discovered the corresponding metabolites, pandorabactin A and B. Their structures and chelate (gallium) complexes were elucidated by a combination of chemical degradation, derivatization, NMR, and MS analysis. Metagenomics and bioinformatics of sputum samples of CF patients indicated that the presence of the pan gene locus correlates with the prevalence of specific bacteria in the lung microbiome. Bioassays and mass spectrometry imaging showed that pandorabactins have antibacterial activities against various lung pathogens (Pseudomonas, Mycobacterium, and Stenotrophomonas) through depleting iron in the competitors. Taken together, these findings offer first insight into niche factors of Pandoraea and indicate that pandorabactins shape the diseased lung microbiota through the competition for iron."

    "abstract": "Mycobacterium abscessus is the most frequent of the rapidly growing mycobacteria responsible for lung infections in patients suffering from cystic fibrosis and COPD. Imipenem is currently recommended in the treatment of these infections in spite of β-lactamase production. Since the targets of β-lactams include transpeptidases of both the l,d and d,d specificities, we tested, in vitro, intracellularly and in vivo, a combination of two β-lactams active on these enzymes, amoxicillin and imipenem, alone or in combination with the β-lactamase inhibitor relebactam. Drug combinations were evaluated against M. abscessus CIP 104536T and clinical isolates (n = 35) by determining MICs, FIC indices and time-killing. Drug combinations were also evaluated in macrophages and in mice. In the presence of relebactam, synergy between amoxicillin and imipenem was observed against both M. abscessus CIP 104536T and the clinical isolates. Against M. abscessus CIP 104536T, the addition of 1 mg/L imipenem and 4 mg/L relebactam led to a decrease in the MIC of amoxicillin from 64 to 1 mg/L. The triple combination was active in vitro and intracellularly (a 4.30 decrease in the log10 cfu/mL and 82% killing, respectively). The triple combination was effective in reducing log10 cfu in mouse organs and mouse spleen weights, and in preventing losses in mouse weights. The amoxicillin/imipenem/relebactam combination was synergistic in vitro and effective in vivo against M. abscessus. Since these drugs are clinically available, the triple combination should be considered by clinicians and further evaluated based on the reporting of the patient outcomes."

    "abstract": "<i>Mycobacterium abscessus</i> (MAB) is a rapidly growing, non-tuberculous mycobacterium that has emerged as a significant pathogen in both pulmonary and extrapulmonary infections. It is rising in prevalence, especially among individuals with underlying lung conditions such as cystic fibrosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, highlighting its growing clinical importance. The treatment of MAB infections is notoriously challenging due to intrinsic resistance to many antibiotics and low cure rates, typically <50%. Macrolides are a cornerstone in the treatment of MAB infections because regimens that include effective macrolide therapy are associated with higher cure rates. However, MAB possesses intrinsic and acquired drug resistance mechanisms against macrolides, complicating drug susceptibility testing and selection of highly effective treatment regimens. This review aims to provide a summary of the current understanding of macrolide resistance mechanisms in MAB. We explored the epidemiology of resistance in different countries and the molecular mechanisms involved. We have highlighted the variability in sensitivity of existing markers to predict phenotypic macrolide drug resistance across different countries, suggesting the involvement of unknown resistance mechanisms. By synthesizing current knowledge and identifying gaps in the literature, this review seeks to inform clinical practice and guide future research efforts in the fight against MAB drug resistance."

    "abstract": "The combination of Elexacaftor/Tezacaftor/Ivacaftor (ETI) has resulted in a significant improvement in lung function and global clinical parameters, which have not been previously achieved with other CFTR modulators. However, there is a paucity of evidence in the literature on the long-term use of ETI in adolescents and patients with severe pulmonary impairment. Furthermore, the response to ETI may differ between homozygotes and heterozygotes, as well as between naïve patients and those previously treated with other CFTR modulators. A retrospective study was conducted to examine changes in percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 s (ppFEV<sub>1</sub>), body-mass index (BMI), and sweat chloride concentration (SwCl) at baseline and at 6, 12 and 24 months after the initiation of ETI. Secondary outcomes included the number of pulmonary exacerbations, Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R) score, adverse events, mortality and transplantation rates. 139 subjects were included and followed up for up to 2 years after starting ETI. The results demonstrated a significant improvement in ppFEV<sub>1</sub> and BMI after 12 months of therapy (respectively, 16%, p < 0.001; +1.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, p = 0.005), with a slight decline in the values after 24 months. This effect was independent of genotype and showed a different degree of response in naïve subjects compared to patients previously treated with other CFTR modulators. SwCl decreased from 84 to 37 mmol/L over 24 months (p < 0.001). 58.3% reduction of PEx rate was observed compared to the number of exacerbations prior to ETI. Overall, lung function, SwCl, PEx rate, CFQ-R scores and BMI improved after 24 months of ETI treatment. ETI was well tolerated, and none of the patients interrupted the treatment due to toxicity."

Developing an efficacious vaccine remains the most promising strategy for combating P. aeruginosa infections. In this study, we employed an advanced in silico strategy to design a highly efficient and stable mRNA vaccine using immunoinformatics tools. Whole proteome data were utilized to identify highly immunogenic vaccine candidates using subtractive proteomics. Three extracellular proteins were prioritized for T- and linear B-cell epitope prediction. Beta-definsin protein sequence was incorporated as an adjuvant at the N-terminus of the construct. A total of 3 CTL, 3 HTL, and 3 linear B cell highly immunogenic epitopes were combined using specific linkers to design this multi-peptide construct. The 5' and 3' UTR sequences, Kozak sequence with a stop codon, and signal peptides followed by a poly-A tail were incorporated into the above vaccine construct to create our final mRNA vaccine. The vaccines exhibited antigenicity scores >0.88, ensuring high antigenicity with no allergenic or toxic. Physiochemical properties analysis revealed high solubility and thermostability. Three-dimensional structural analysis determined high-quality structures. Vaccine-receptor docking and molecular dynamic simulations demonstrated strong molecular interactions, stable binding affinities, dynamic nature, and structural stability of this vaccine, with significant immunogenic responses of the immune system against the vaccine. The immunological simulation indicates successful cellular and humoral immune responses to defend against P. aeruginosa infection.

    "abstract": "Small airways (<2 mm diameter) are major sites of airflow obstruction in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This study aimed to quantify the impact of small airway disease, characterized by narrowing, occlusion, and obliteration, on airflow parameters in smokers and end-stage patients with COPDs. We performed computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of inspiratory airflow in three lung groups: control non-used donor lungs (no smoking/emphysema history), non-used donor lungs with a smoking history and emphysema, and explanted end-stage COPD lungs. Each group included four lungs, with two tissue cylinders. Micro-CT-scanned small airways were segmented into 3D models for CFD simulations to quantify pressure, resistance, and shear stress. CFD results were benchmarked against simplified linear and Weibel models. CFD simulations showed higher pressures in COPD vs. controls (p = 0.0091) and smokers (p = 0.015), along with increased resistance (p = 0.0057 vs. controls; p = 0.0083 vs. smokers) and up to a tenfold rise in shear stress (p = 0.010 vs. controls). Narrowing and occlusion were shown to independently increase pressure, resistance, and shear stress, which were validated through segmentation corrections. Pressures and resistance assessed with simplified models were up to seven-fold higher for smokers and even 72 higher for COPD compared with CFD values. These findings show that increased airflow parameters can explain the association between small airway disease and airflow limitation in COPD, underscoring small airway vulnerability. Additionally, they highlight the limitations of theoretical models in accurately capturing small airway disease. Supported by the KU Leuven (C16/19/005)."

    "abstract": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen responsible for airway infections in immunocompromised individuals, including those with cystic fibrosis (CF). P. aeruginosa has a type III secretion system (T3SS) that translocates effectors into host cells. ExoS is a T3SS effector with ADP ribosyltransferase (ADPRT) activity. ExoS ADPRT activity promotes P. aeruginosa virulence by inhibiting phagocytosis and limiting oxidative burst in neutrophils. The P. aeruginosa T3SS also translocates flagellin, which can activate the NLRC4 inflammasome, resulting in: 1) gasdermin-D pores, release of IL-1β and pyroptosis; and 2) histone 3 citrullination (CitH3), nuclear DNA decondensation and expansion into the neutrophil cytosol with incomplete NET extrusion. However, studies with P. aeruginosa PAO1 indicate that ExoS ADPRT activity inhibits the NLRC4 inflammasome in neutrophils. Here, we identified an ExoS+ CF clinical isolate of P. aeruginosa with a hyperactive T3SS. Variants of the hyperactive T3SS mutant or PAO1 were used to infect neutrophils from C57BL/6 mice that were wildtype or engineered to have a CF genotype or defects in inflammasome assembly. Responses to NLRC4 inflammasome assembly or ExoS ADPRT activity were assayed and found to be similar for C57BL/6 or CF neutrophils. ExoS ADPRT activity in the hyperactive T3SS mutant regulated inflammasome, nuclear DNA decondensation and incomplete NET extrusion responses, like PAO1, but promoted enhanced CitH3 and plasma membrane rupture (PMR). Glycine supplementation inhibited PMR by the hyperactive T3SS mutant, suggesting ninjurin-1 is required for this process. These results identify enhanced neutrophil PMR as a pathogenic activity of ExoS ADPRT in hypervirulent P. aeruginosa."

The concurrent presence of Riedel's thyroiditis with noninvasive follicular neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features (NIFTP) is exceptionally rare and has not been previously reported. A 63-year-old male presented with an acute onset anterior cervical mass, fever, and dysphagia. Imaging revealed a large cystic mass in the right thyroid lobe extending into the mediastinum. Initial treatment with antibiotics led to partial improvement, but persistent swelling necessitated a deferred total thyroidectomy. Intraoperatively, the thyroid gland was fibrotic and adherent to surrounding structures. Histopathological examination confirmed Riedel's thyroiditis with extrathyroidal extension and an underlying NIFTP. Postoperatively, the patient developed left vocal cord paresis and primary hypoparathyroidism. Systemic fibrotic involvement was ruled out through a thoracoabdominal-pelvic computed tomography (CT) scan. This case highlights the diagnostic challenges, atypical presentation, and management strategies of this unique coexistence, initially masquerading as a thyroid abscess."

This has also allowed care providers and people with cystic fibrosis in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) to become more knowledgeable and proficient in cystic fibrosis cares. This review focuses on two main aspects highly relevant to understand the current status of cystic fibrosis in LMICs: The recognition of the universal occurrence of cystic fibrosis, as well as the varying incidence in different regions of the world, and the collaborative international efforts for dissemination of best care practices as an attempt to close gaps in care. As the field continues to change rapidly, multiple international efforts are attempting to close gaps and disparities clearly apparent between affluent countries and LMICs. However, these efforts are seriously hampered by limited access to effective therapies and most dramatically to CFTR modulator drugs."

    "abstract": "<i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> is one of the most common pathogens isolated from the lungs of people with cystic fibrosis (CF), but little is known about its ability to colonize this niche. We performed a transposon-sequencing (Tn-seq) screen to identify genes necessary for <i>S. aureus</i> growth in media prepared from <i>ex vivo</i> CF sputum. We identified 19 genes that were required for growth in all sputum media tested and dozens more that were required for growth in at least one sputum medium. Depleted mutants of interest included insertions in many genes important for surviving metal starvation, as well as the primary regulator of cysteine metabolism, <i>cymR</i>. To investigate the mechanisms by which these genes contribute to <i>S. aureus</i> growth in sputum, we quantified low-molecular-weight thiols, nutrient transition metals, and the host metal-sequestration protein calprotectin in sputum from 11 individuals with CF. In all samples, the abundance of calprotectin exceeded nutrient metal concentration, explaining the <i>S. aureus</i> requirement for metal-starvation genes. Furthermore, all samples contain potentially toxic quantities of cysteine and sufficient glutathione to satisfy the organic sulfur requirements of <i>S. aureus</i>. Deletion of the cysteine importer genes <i>tcyA</i> and <i>tcyP</i> in the ∆<i>cymR</i> background restored growth to wild-type levels in CF sputum, suggesting that the mechanism by which <i>cymR</i> is required for growth in sputum is to prevent uncontrolled import of cysteine or cystine from this environment. Overall, this work demonstrates that calprotectin and cysteine limit <i>S. aureus</i> growth in CF sputum.IMPORTANCE<i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> is a major cause of lung infections in people with cystic fibrosis (CF).

Novel matrix pencil decomposition MRI (MP-MRI) is a contrast agent-free alternative, but further validation of this technique is needed. The aim of this study was to evaluate the applicability of the validated morpho-functional chest MRI score for CE perfusion and MP perfusion MRI in a multireader approach. Twenty-seven pwCF (mean age 20.8 years, range 8.4-45.7 years) underwent morpho-functional MRI including CE perfusion and MP perfusion MRI in the same examination. Nine blinded chest radiologists of different experience levels assessed lung perfusion and applied the validated chest MRI score to CE- and MP-MRI. Inter-reader agreement of perfusion scores in CE- and MP-MRI were compared with each other and with the MRI morphology score. Differences according to the readers' experience were also analyzed. The CE perfusion scores were overall lower than the MP perfusion scores (6.2 ± 3.3 vs. 6.9 ± 2.0; <i>p</i> < 0.05) with a strong correlation between both perfusion scores (<i>r</i> = 0.74; <i>p</i> < 0.01). The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) as measure for inter-reader agreement was good and significant for both perfusion scores, but higher for the CE perfusion score (0.75, <i>p</i> < 0.001) than for MP perfusion scores (0.61, <i>p</i> < 0.001). The Bland-Altman analysis revealed a difference in CE and MP perfusion scores with more extreme values in CE perfusion scores compared to MP perfusion scores (<i>r</i> = 0.62, <i>p</i> < 0.001).

We did not find a difference in scoring according to the radiological experience level. The established chest MRI score can be applied both to validated CE and novel MP perfusion MRI with a good interreader reliability. The remaining difference between CE and MP-MRI scores may be explained by a lack of routine in visual analysis of MP-MRI and may favor an automated analysis for use of MP-MRI as a noninvasive outcome measure."

    "abstract": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) affects more than 160,000 individuals globally and has seen improved survival rates due to multidisciplinary care models and pharmacotherapy innovations. However, the associated costs remain substantial, prompting the authors to study and evaluate the expense of CF ambulatory care to understand how care structure influences costs. People with CF (PwCF) at large pediatric CF centers in both the United States and Ireland were recruited for parallel observational, prospective studies. Based upon the process of care, the lead clinicians at both sites identified and agreed on three strata of patients (0-11 months, 1-5 years, and 6-17 years of age). Process maps were developed for each of the age cohorts at each site, and the costs of ambulatory care - with emphasis on routine CF clinic visits - were measured utilizing time-driven activity-based costing (TDABC). A dollar-per-minute capacity cost rate (CCR) was calculated for all resources used in the care cycle. The total direct cost was obtained by multiplying the CCR for each resource by the time the resource was used during the patient's care cycle. The cost was summed across all resource types to obtain the cost over the entire care cycle for each site. Service operations were benchmarked to one site and variance analysis was performed. In total, 58 PwCF were included in the analysis (49 in the United States and 9 in Ireland); 4 were 0-11 months, 17 were 1-5 years, and 37 were 6-17 years of age. Physicians (United States) and respiratory consultants (Ireland) had the highest CCRs. Physicians and registered dietitians spent the most time with patients in the United States, compared with the clinical nurse specialists and dietitians in Ireland. The total variance in cost for clinical visits was largest in the 6- to 17-year-old group (28% variance, with 100% in the United States vs. 128% in Ireland). In the 6- to 17-year-old group, the largest drivers in total variance were quantity variance (variance in duration of time spent with patients), which was 108% greater in Ireland); the skill mix variance (variance in clinician type performing service for a given time), which was 49% greater in the United States; and the rate variance (variance in compensation levels across sites), which was 31% greater in the United States. The authors' use of TDABC to characterize the cost of multidisciplinary care during ambulatory clinic visits for PwCF, in combination with variance analysis (the quantitative investigation of the difference between actual and expected costs), provides new and innovative ways to compare costs across similar health care service delivery sites, providing insights into the distinctive features of each. A granular understanding of cost and comparison of resource utilization between centers provides valuable, organizationally relevant insights."

The review also evaluates emerging personalized approaches such as gene and mRNA therapy that hold promise for restoring ciliary function and reducing the burden of acute infections in pediatric PCD. Acute respiratory infections have a significant impact on morbidity in pediatric PCD, driving progressive airway remodeling. While current treatment strategies focus on managing infections directly, emerging therapies targeting inflammation and genetic causes hold promise for reducing infection burden and improving long-term outcomes. Future advances in personalized medicine could further enhance therapeutic approaches in this population."

Current therapeutics have poor efficacy. Strategies of bacterial control based on host defenses are appealing; however, antimycobacterial immunity remains poorly understood and is further complicated by the appearance of smooth and rough morphotypes, which elicit distinct host responses. We investigated the role of serum components in neutrophil-mediated clearance of <i>M. abscessus</i> morphotypes. <i>M. abscessus</i> opsonization with complement enhanced bacterial killing compared to complement-deficient opsonization. Killing of rough isolates was less reliant on complement. Complement C3 and mannose-binding lectin 2 (MBL2) were deposited on <i>M. abscessus</i> morphotypes in distinct patterns, with a greater association of MBL2 on rough <i>M. abscessus</i>. Killing was dependent on C3; however, depletion and competition experiments indicate that canonical complement activation pathways are not involved. Complement-mediated killing relied on natural IgG and IgM for smooth morphotypes and on IgG for rough morphotypes. Both morphotypes were recognized by complement receptor 3 in a carbohydrate- and calcium-dependent manner. These findings indicate a role for noncanonical C3 activation pathways for <i>M. abscessus</i> clearance by neutrophils and link smooth-to-rough adaptation to complement activation."

    "title": "Pancreatic Status Is Not a Risk Factor for Cystic Fibrosis-Related Bone Disease.",
    "abstract": "As the life expectancy of people with cystic fibrosis (PwCF) increases, understanding long-term complications, including CF-related bone disease (CFBD), is crucial. This study aimed to longitudinally characterize CFBD and to compare the bone status of pancreatic sufficient (PS) and pancreatic insufficient (PI) PwCF. This longitudinal analysis included PwCF older than 8 years of age who had at least one dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry test between 2008 and 2021. Data were collected on serum parameters of bone metabolism, nutritional history, habitual activity, and fractures in addition to other demographic and clinical characteristics. The study included 80 PwCF: 32 (40%) were PS and 48 (60%) PI. Normal dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry results were found in 42 (53%) patients: 16 (50%) in the PS group and 26 (54%) in the PI group (p = 0.72). Three (9%) of the PS group and seven (15%) of the PI group had at least one Z-score below -2 (p = 0.49). The longitudinal bone density decline over a mean of 4.8 years was similar in the two groups. In a logistic regression analysis, pancreatic insufficiency was not found to be a risk factor for CFBD. Female sex was the only significant risk factor for a pathological Z-score. The prevalence and severity of CFBD were not found to correlate with pancreatic sufficiency. The similar prevalence of CFBD between patients with PS and PI suggests that screening, and eventually treatment, should be offered to all PwCF, irrespective of pancreatic status."

    "abstract": "Dipeptidyl peptidase-1 (DPP-1) inhibitors have been studied for the treatment of neutrophil-mediated inflammatory diseases including bronchiectasis, bronchial asthma and cystic fibrosis. This study evaluated the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety and tolerability of DPP-1 inhibitor HSK31858 in healthy Chinese volunteers. Volunteers in Part A randomly received single doses of HSK31858 (15, 40, 60 and 80 mg) or placebo in fasted states. The 40-mg cohort also received HSK31858 40 mg or placebo in fed states. In Part B, volunteers randomly received HSK31858 10, 20 and 40 mg or placebo once daily for 28 days in fasted states. The primary endpoints were safety and tolerability of HSK31858. Among 38 volunteers in Part A and 36 in Part B, HSK31858 was well tolerated; no deaths, serious adverse events, or discontinuations due to adverse events occurred. The median T<sub>max</sub> was 0.75 to 1.0 h and the mean terminal t<sub>1/2</sub> was 16.5 to 21.0 h in the fasted state with single doses of HSK31858. Both C<sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>0-t</sub> exhibited a dose-dependent rise. Food had no effect on AUC. Multiple doses of HSK31858 demonstrated a similar pharmacokinetics profile, with about 2-fold accumulation in AUC. HSK31858 dose-dependently inhibited neutrophil count-normalized neutrophil elastase (NE<sub>norm</sub>) activity. The maximal percentage decrease in NE<sub>norm</sub> activity relative to baseline during 28 days of HSK31858 treatments was 13.6% and 76.4% with HSK31858 10 and 40 mg once-daily, respectively. HSK31858 was safe and well tolerated. The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics profile of HSK31858 supports further clinical development for the treatment of neutrophil-mediated inflammatory diseases. NCT05663593."

    "abstract": "Azoospermia, the most severe form of male infertility, is categorized into two types: non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA) and obstructive azoospermia (OA), which exhibit significant genetic heterogeneity. Azoospermia factor (AZF) deletion is a common cause of NOA, whereas congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD), a severe subtype of OA, is frequently linked to cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene variants. This case report is the first to document the coexistence of a partial AZFa microdeletion and a homozygous CFTR variant in a CBAVD-affected azoospermic patient with intact spermatogenesis. A 32-year-old man presented with primary infertility and azoospermia. Clinical evaluation revealed CBAVD (normal hormone levels, low semen volume, pH 6.0, and absence of the vas deferens). Genetic analysis accidentally revealed a 384.9 kb AZFa deletion (sY84 and sY86, but not sY1064, 1182) that removed USP9Y but retained DDX3Y in the proband, his fertile brother, and his father. A homozygous CFTR variant (TG12-5T) was also detected in the proband and his brother and was inherited from heterozygous parental carriers. Microdissection testicular sperm extraction (micro-TESE) revealed intact spermatogenesis, confirmed by histology and immunofluorescence, indicating normal germ cell development. This case expands the intricate genetic spectrum of azoospermia by illustrating the critical role of DDX3Y in the AZFa region in spermatogenesis and the variable penetrance of CFTR variant (TG12-5T) in CBAVD. These insights may refine diagnostic strategies and underscore the necessity for tailored fertility management in individuals with multifactorial genetic anomalies."

    "abstract": "Preterm birth disrupts intestinal epithelial maturation, impairing digestive and absorptive functions. This study integrates analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing datasets, spanning fetal to adult stages, with human preterm intestinal models derived from the ileal tissue of preterm infants. We investigate the potential of extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from human Wharton's jelly mesenchymal stem cells to promote intestinal maturation. Distinct enterocyte differentiation trajectories are identified during the transition from immature to mature stages of human intestinal development. EV treatment, particularly with the EV39 line, significantly upregulates maturation-specific gene expression related to enterocyte function. Gene set enrichment analysis reveals an enrichment of TGFβ1 signaling pathways, and proteomic analysis identifies TGFβ1 and FGF2 as key mediators of EV39's effects. These treatments enhance cell proliferation, epithelial barrier integrity, and fatty acid uptake, primarily through CFTR-dependent mechanisms-unique to human preterm models, not observed in mouse intestinal organoids. This highlights the translational potential of EV39 and CFTR activation in promoting the functional maturation of the premature human intestine."

    "abstract": "Overactive neutrophilic inflammation causes damage to the airways and death in people with cystic fibrosis (CF), a genetic disorder resulting from mutations in the CFTR gene. Reducing the impact of inflammation is therefore a major concern in CF. Evidence indicates that dysfunctional NRF2 signaling in CF individuals may impair their ability to regulate their oxidative and inflammatory responses, although the role of NRF2 in neutrophil-dominated inflammation and tissue damage associated with CF has not been determined. Therefore, we examined whether curcumin, an activator of NRF2, might provide a beneficial effect in the context of CF. Combining Cftr-depleted zebrafish as an innovative biomedical model with CF patient-derived airway organoids (AOs), we aimed to understand how NRF2 dysfunction leads to abnormal inflammatory status and tissue remodeling and determine the effects of curcumin in reducing inflammation and tissue damage in CF. We demonstrate that NFR2 is instrumental in regulating neutrophilic inflammation and repair processes in vivo, thereby preventing inflammatory damage. Importantly, curcumin treatment restores NRF2 activity in both CF zebrafish and AOs. Curcumin reduces neutrophilic inflammation in CF context, by rebalancing the production of epithelial ROS and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, curcumin improves tissue repair by reducing CF-associated fibrosis. Our findings demonstrate that curcumin prevents CF-mediated inflammation via activating the NRF2 pathway. This work highlights the protective role of NRF2 in limiting inflammation and injury and show that therapeutic strategies to normalize NRF2 activity, using curcumin or others NRF2 activators, might simultaneously reduce airway inflammation and damage in CF."

    "title": "ATP depletion in anthrax edema toxin pathogenesis.",
    "abstract": "Anthrax lethal toxin (LT) and edema toxin (ET) are two of the major virulence factors of Bacillus anthracis, the causative pathogen of anthrax disease. While the roles of LT in anthrax pathogenesis have been extensively studied, the pathogenic mechanism of ET remains poorly understood. ET is a calmodulin-dependent adenylate cyclase that elevates intracellular cAMP by converting ATP to cAMP. Thus, it was postulated that the ET-induced in vivo toxicity is mediated by certain cAMP-dependent events. However, mechanisms linking cAMP elevation and ET-induced damage have not been established. Cholera toxin is another bacterial toxin that increases cAMP. This toxin is known to cause severe intestinal fluid secretion and dehydration by cAMP-mediated activation of protein kinase A (PKA), which in turn activates cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). The cAMP-activated PKA phosphorylation of CFTR on the surface of intestinal epithelial cells leads to an efflux of chloride ions accompanied by secretion of H2O into the intestinal lumen, causing rapid fluid loss, severe diarrhea and dehydration. Due to similar in vivo effects, it was generally believed that ET and cholera toxin would exhibit a similar pathogenic mechanism. Surprisingly, in this work, we found that cAMP-mediated PKA/CFTR activation is not essential for ET to exert its in vivo toxicity. Instead, our data suggest that ET-induced ATP depletion may play an important role in the toxin's pathogenesis."

Therefore, this study aimed to assess the effects of an exercise intervention on exercise capacity in adults with CF, comparing those treated with and without ETI. A total of 56 adult pwCF participated in this quasi-experimental study as part of a rehabilitation program, which included a 3.5-week exercise intervention. The program involved five weekly 45-min sessions, including endurance training on a cycle ergometer. VO<sub>2</sub> <sub>peak</sub> and W<sub>peak</sub> were the primary outcomes used to assess changes in exercise capacity. The intervention significantly increased VO<sub>2</sub> <sub>peak</sub> and W<sub>peak</sub> in all pwCF, regardless of ETI use, with similar improvements between groups. PwCF with lower baseline fitness (VO<sub>2</sub> <sub>peak</sub> ≤ 81%pred) showed greater improvements than those with higher fitness (VO<sub>2</sub> <sub>peak</sub> ≥ 82%pred). ppFEV1 remained unchanged, while BMI increased in both groups. Notably, the ETI group spent significantly more time in physical activity (PA) at hard and very hard intensities compared to the non-ETI group. Additionally, a positive correlation was observed between PA intensity and VO<sub>2</sub> <sub>peak</sub> and W<sub>peak</sub> in the ETI group. Independent of ETI treatment, adult pwCF improve their exercise capacity by participating in a regular exercise program. ETI treatment appears to enhance time spent in higher PA intensities. Despite the effectiveness of CFTR modulators, regular PA and exercise remain essential to maintain and improve exercise capacity in pwCF."

Eight participants [six male and two female, median (min-max) age 42.5 (27-52)] were purposively recruited from the Toronto Adult CF Centre at St. Michael's Hospital, Unity Health Toronto. <b>Results:</b> Four key themes were generated from participants' accounts. First, they described the intensive nature of CF self-management and its influence on their perceptions and selection of ACT techniques. Second, they emphasized the importance of healthcare professional guidance in treatment decisions. Third, physical health status, exercise, and CF transmembrane conductance regulator modulator therapy also shaped participants' self-management approaches. Lastly, their social context influenced how they navigated self-management, which evolved over time. <b>Conclusion:</b> This study shows that ACT technique selection is influenced by various evolving needs across the lifespan. Understanding the role that patient experiences play in ACT technique selection may help clinicians personalize recommendations and promote patient-centred care."

    "abstract": "An emerging body of evidence suggests that psychological flexibility may be an important and underexamined determinant of overall psychological functioning. The chronic nature of cystic fibrosis (CF) may require a greater level of flexibility to navigate complex and dynamic health concerns in an increasingly aging population. We examined associations between psychological flexibility, coping styles, psychological grit, and negative affectivity (anxiety and depressive symptoms) from baseline assessments of randomized trials among adults with CF. Regression models controlling for age, sex, income, psychotropic medication use, and pulmonary function were used to characterize associations between psychological flexibility, coping styles, and negative affect. A total of 124 individuals were included in analyses, 74 (60%) of whom were taking psychotropic medication. Depressive [Beck Depression Inventory-II = 18.6 (SD = 9.9)] and anxious [Beck Anxiety Inventory = 13.8 (SD = 9.3)] symptoms were both elevated. Greater levels of psychological flexibility were associated with lower negative affect, such that individuals reporting less cognitive fusion (B = -0.59, p < .001) and greater psychological acceptance (B = -0.51. p < .001) exhibited lesser levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms. Psychological flexibility was the most robust correlate of negative affect after accounting for other coping variables (B = -0.50, p < .001), and this association was not moderated by forced expiratory volume in 1 second/forced vital capacity levels. Psychological flexibility is robustly associated with decreased negative affect among individuals with CF, independent of background and clinical characteristics."

An observational, multicenter cohort study of IBD children with anemia at the diagnosis enrolled in the Italian Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition IBD registry. Data were collected at the diagnosis and at 1 year. Five hundred eighty-nine (295 Crohn's disease [CD] [50%] and 294 ulcerative colitis [UC]/IBD unclassified [IBDU] [50%]) of 1634 patients with IBD presented with anemia (36%). Anemia rate was higher in CD than in UC (39% vs. 33%, p = 0.009), and most patients had moderate anemia (55%). Children with CD had higher rates of mild anemia than UC (38% vs. 33%, p < 0.0001), while severe anemia was more common in UC (13% vs. 6%, p = 0.001). In CD, lower age at the diagnosis and lower albumin level correlated with anemia severity (p = 0.0007 and <0.0001, respectively). In UC, severe disease was more common in patients with severe anemia compared to those with mild and moderate anemia (20.6% vs. 43.6%, p = 0.01; 17% vs. 43.6%, p = 0.001). At 1 year, 99 children (22.9%) were persistently anemic and were characterized by a more severe disease compared to those who had resolved their anemia. More than one third of IBD children present with anemia, most commonly moderate. Severe anemia is more common in UC compared to CD. One in four patients is still anemic after 1 year from the diagnosis, suggesting inadequate attention to the issue and the need for dedicated therapeutic management and careful monitoring."

We show how G-formula can be implemented using Bayesian multiple imputation methods for synthetic data, and that by doing so, we can impute missing data and simulate the counterfactuals of interest within a single coherent approach. We describe how this can be achieved using standard multiple imputation software and explore its performance using a simulation study and an application from cystic fibrosis."

A total of 64 adults with CF were maintained on ETI therapy as part of their routine CF care, and completed the Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire. Patient demographics, lung function, body mass index and quality of life using the Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire Revised were collected as part of routine clinical care. Duration of ETI therapy along with medicines possession ratio was recorded. Patients reported strong beliefs about the necessity of ETI therapy. The majority of patients (78%) reported low concerns about ETI therapy while 22% of patients reported high concerns. A small number of patients (n=4) had concerns which were stronger than their beliefs about necessity. Patients reported strong beliefs in the necessity of ETI therapy. Although concerns were lower, a significant proportion of the sample had strong concerns about their ETI therapy. By being aware of people with CF's necessity and concerns beliefs around ETI therapy clinical teams will be better armed to engage them in treatment decisions and support optimal adherence."

    "title": "Pathophysiological mechanisms of exertional dyspnea in people with cardiopulmonary disease: Recent advances.",
    "abstract": "Physical activity is a leading trigger of dyspnea in chronic cardiopulmonary diseases. Recently, there has been a renewed interest in uncovering the mechanisms underlying this distressing symptom. We start by articulating a conceptual framework linking cardiorespiratory abnormalities with the central perception of undesirable respiratory sensations during exercise. We specifically emphasize that exertional dyspnea ultimately reflects an imbalance between (high) demand and (low) capacity. As such, the symptom arises in the presence of a heightened inspiratory neural drive - the will to breathe - secondary to a) increased ventilatory output relative to the instantaneous ventilatory capacity (excessive breathing) and/or b) its impeded translation into the act of breathing due to constraints on tidal volume expansion (constrained breathing). In patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, cystic fibrosis, and interstitial lung disease (ILD), constrained breathing assumes a more dominant role as the disease progresses. Excessive breathing due to heightened wasted ventilation in the physiological dead space is particularly important in the initial stages of COPD, while alveolar hyperventilation has a major contributory role in hypoxemic patients with ILD. Hyperventilation is also a leading driver of dyspnea in heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction (EF), while high physiological dead space is the main underlying mechanism in HF with preserved EF. Similarly, wasted ventilation in poorly perfused lung tissue dominates the scene in pulmonary vascular disease. New artificial intelligence-based approaches to expose the contribution of excessive and constrained breathing may enhance the yield of cardiopulmonary exercise testing in investigating exertional dyspnea in these patients."

    "abstract": "Mycobacterium abscessus (MABS) is an emerging pathogen causing severe infections, particularly in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. A prospective multicentre study included CF patients from four hospitals in Madrid between January 2022 and January 2024. Respiratory samples were collected, and MABS isolates were analysed to determine their antibiotic resistance profiles, growth dynamics, infection kinetics, intracellular behaviour, and pathogenicity. Intracellular bacterial growth and macrophage viability were evaluated through THP-1 cell infection experiments, with and without amikacin. Phenotypic susceptibility testing and genotypic susceptibility testing were also conducted. Among 148 patients, 28 MABS isolates were detected from 16 patients (10.8%), and the first isolate from each patient was analysed. Isolation was more prevalent in younger individuals (median age 24.4 vs. 28.4 years, p = 0.049), and most isolates (81.25%) were identified as M. abscessus subsp. abscessus (MABSa). MABS isolates exhibited high resistance rates (>85%) to doxycycline, tobramycin, ciprofloxacin, moxifloxacin (75%) and cotrimoxazole (56.3%). Amikacin resistance (18.8%) was higher than expected, and inducible (10/16 isolates) or acquired (1/16 isolate) macrolide resistance was found in 68.8% of strains. Phenotypic and genotypic testing results were fully concordant. Tigecycline demonstrated strong in vitro activity, and resistance to imipenem, linezolid, and cefoxitin remained low. Rough strains displayed lower optical density values in later growth stages, probably due to their increased aggregation. In THP-1 cell infection experiments, rough strains showed higher intracellular bacterial loads with statistically significant differences observed at 2 hours (both with and without amikacin) and at 72 hours (with amikacin) post infection. Notably, rough strains also exhibited a higher internalisation index and greater impact on THP-1 cell viability, especially in the absence of amikacin."

In particular, the triple combination therapy composed of elexacaftor, tezacaftor, and ivacaftor (ETI) has changed the CF therapeutic landscape by significantly improving lung function, quality of life, and predicted survival rates. Here, we provided a comprehensive summary of the impact of ETI on clinical outcomes and the need for further research on long-term efficacy, side effects, pregnancy, possible drug-drug interactions, and extra-pulmonary manifestations. Moreover, a significant number of pwCF are unresponsive to these drugs or cannot afford their high costs. We, therefore, discussed health inequity issues and alternative therapeutic strategies under development aiming to obtain effective therapies for all pwCF."

Bacteriophage therapy is being investigated as a treatment for antibiotic-resistant <i>P. aeruginosa</i> infections. Although virulent bacteriophages have shown promise in treating <i>P. aeruginosa</i> infections, the development of bacteriophage-insensitive mutants (BIMs) in the presence of bacteriophages has been described. The aim of this study was to examine the genetic changes associated with the BIM phenotype. Biofilms of three genetically distinct <i>P. aeruginosa</i> strains, including PAO1 (ATCC 15692), and two clinical respiratory isolates (one CF and one non-CF) were grown for 7 days and treated with either a cocktail of four bacteriophages or a vehicle control for 7 consecutive days. BIMs isolated from the biofilms were detected by streak assays, and resistance to the phage cocktail was confirmed using spot test assays. Comparison of whole genome sequencing between the recovered BIMs and their respective vehicle control-treated phage-sensitive isolates revealed structural variants in two strains, and several small variants in all three strains. These variations involved a TonB-dependent outer membrane receptor in one strain, and mutations in lipopolysaccharide synthesis genes in two strains. Prophage deletion and induction were also noted in two strains, as well as mutations in several genes associated with virulence factors. Mutations in genes involved in susceptibility to conventional antibiotics were also identified in BIMs, with both decreased and increased antibiotic sensitivity to various antibiotics being observed. These findings may have implications for future applications of lytic phage therapy.IMPORTANCELytic bacteriophages are viruses that infect and kill bacteria and can be used to treat difficult-to-treat bacterial infections, including biofilm-associated infections and multidrug-resistant bacteria. <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> is a bacterium that can cause life-threatening infections.

Some of these metabolites inhibit <i>S. aureus</i> respiration. SrrAB is a staphylococcal two-component regulatory system (TCRS) that responds to alterations in respiratory status and helps <i>S. aureus</i> transition between fermentative and respiratory metabolisms. We used <i>P. aeruginosa</i> mutant strains and chemical genetics to demonstrate that <i>P. aeruginosa</i> secondary metabolites, HQNO in particular, inhibit <i>S. aureus</i> respiration, resulting in modified SrrAB stimulation. Metabolomic analyses found that the ratio of NAD<sup>+</sup> to NADH increased upon prolonged culture with HQNO. Consistent with this, the activity of the Rex transcriptional regulator, which senses and responds to alterations in the NAD<sup>+</sup> / NADH ratio, had altered activity upon HQNO treatment. The presence of SrrAB increased fitness when cultured with HQNO and increased survival when challenged with <i>P. aeruginosa. S. aureus</i> strains with a decreased ability to maintain redox homeostasis via fermentation had decreased fitness when challenged with HQNO and decreased survival when challenged with <i>P. aeruginosa</i>.

A key challenge in EV biology as well as LNP design remains vesicle to cell interaction and the creation of a polar permeability pathway necessary for cargo exchange. Membrane to membrane recognition and intercalation are tantamount to delivery and integral to function of both EVs and LNPs, both complex and single component. We reasoned that the overlapping advantages of both nanoparticles centered on compositional lipids. EVs are encapsulations using biological membrane lipids and expressed proteins and have a larger carrier capacity. LNPs are composed of synthetic lipids differing in charge and amount mimicking those present in biological membranes and include a synthetic lipid of choice that carries a charge, designed to enhance biological membrane disruption and subsequent cargo off-loading. Our goal was to design hybrid EVs (HEVs) that combined both elements. We manufactured positively charged liposomes (Lip) carrying mRNA coding for fluorescent proteins to load isolated EVs in order to create a combinatorial delivery platform. Using knowledge from LNP-based mRNA vaccine delivery, we have formulated and characterized HEVs. Future therapeutic strategies could involve isolating EVs from patients, hybridizing them with synthetic lipids loaded with desired payloads, and reintroducing them to the patient. This approach is particularly relevant for enhancing the function of pulmonary innate immunity in diseases like cystic fibrosis, chronic granulomatous disease, and pulmonary fibrosis. By conducting both in-vitro and in-vivo assays, we demonstrate that HEVs exhibit comparable transfection efficacy to LNPs composed of complex synthetic lipids, while significantly reducing cytotoxicity. This highlights their potential as safer and more efficient delivery vehicles."

Rectal mucosal organoid cultures demonstrated residual CFTR function with responsiveness to ivacaftor and the combination of elexacaftor, tezacaftor, and ivacaftor. This case highlights a unique combination of heterozygous CFTR variants in a person with CF respiratory disease, which may be amendable to CFTR modulation therapy."

    "abstract": "Polysaccharide from Atractylodes macrocephala Koidz. (PAMK), a bioactive component of Atractylodes macrocephala Koidz. (AMK), demonstrates a wide range of pharmacological activities, including the enhancement of gastrointestinal function and regulation of internal homeostasis. This study explores the potential of PAMK in alleviating pyrotinib-induced diarrhea and modulating gut microbiota and its metabolites. Pyrotinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor used in cancer treatment, is known for its side effect of diarrhea, which significantly diminishes patients' quality of life. Our prior research suggests that pyrotinib-induced diarrhea may be linked to CFTR-mediated dysregulation of chloride secretion. The present findings indicate that PAMK alleviates pyrotinib-induced diarrhea by reducing cAMP levels, activating the LKB1/AMPK pathway, and inhibiting CFTR activity, as confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), qRT-PCR, and western blot analyses. PAMK effectively decreased CFTR-mediated chloride ion secretion in pyrotinib-treated cells, as shown by the MQAE assay. At specific doses, PAMK alleviated pyrotinib-induced diarrhea in rats and significantly restored intestinal barrier integrity. Furthermore, PAMK treatment rebalanced the gut microbiota, reversing the pyrotinib-induced increase in Clostridium and Erysipelotrichi species. Metabolomic profiling further highlighted the involvement of the AMPK signaling pathway. These findings provide a basis for future research aimed at developing cancer treatments with reduced side effects."

    "abstract": "Premature termination codon (PTC) diseases account for ∼12% of all human disease mutations. Although there are no FDA approved treatments for increasing PTC readthrough, one readthrough inducing drug, ataluren, has conditional approval for treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy elsewhere. Ataluren displays low toxicity in clinical trials for treatment of PTC diseases, but its therapeutic effects are inconsistent. The messenger RNA (mRNA) sequence context of a PTC is a major determinant of PTC readthrough efficiency. We have shown that ataluren stimulates readthrough exclusively by competitively inhibiting release factor complex (RFC) catalysis of translation termination. Here, using an in vitro reconstituted system, we demonstrate that PTC identity and the immediately adjacent mRNA sequence contexts modulate RFC activity in terminating peptide elongation. Such modulation largely determines the effectiveness of ataluren in stimulating readthrough, whether added alone or in combination with either the aminoglycoside G418 or an anticodon edited aa-tRNA, which stimulate readthrough by mechanisms orthogonal to that of ataluren. Our results suggest a potential rationale for the variability of ataluren effectiveness in stimulating readthrough. We hypothesize that patients harboring a PTC mutation within a sequence context promoting strong interaction with RFC will be resistant to ataluren, but that ataluren treatment will be more effective for patient sequences conferring weaker interaction with RFC."

    "abstract": "Olfactory dysfunction (OD) is common among people with cystic fibrosis (PwCF) and chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). OD is associated with impaired quality of life (QOL) and dietary alterations in certain non-CF populations. This study explored relationships between OD, QOL, and modulator use in PwCF. This is a cross-sectional analysis of an ongoing multicenter, prospective study (2019-2023) investigating PwCF with comorbid CRS. Participants completed the 40-Question Smell Identification Test (SIT-40), 22-question SinoNasal Outcome Test-(SNOT-22), Questionnaire of Olfactory Disorders (QOD-NS), and Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R). Clinical and sinus CT data were collected. After stratification by SIT-40 score, data was analyzed by chi-square, Kruskal-Wallis, Spearman correlation, and logistic regression to identify factors associated with OD. Of 59 participants, those with anosmia (n = 12) had worse eating-related QOL (CFQ-R eating) compared to individuals with normosmia (n = 16) and hyposmia (n = 31). Participants with anosmia had worse sinus CT scores than those with hyposmia. Although PwCF treated with highly effective modulator therapy (HEMT; n = 30) had better CT scores vs. non-HEMT individuals (n = 23), rates of OD in both groups were comparable. Higher SNOT-22 total scores were associated with increased odds of hyposmia or anosmia. In an eating-related QOD-NS subscore, those with worse CFQ-R eating had 2.38 times higher odds of having OD. Each point decrease in CFQ-R eating domain score was associated with 10% increased odds of OD. In PwCF, OD was associated with increased CRS severity, impaired olfactory QOL, and decreased CFQ-R eating. There were no differences in SIT-40 or QOD-NS scores based on HEMT status. NCT04469439."

    "abstract": "Activation of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) Cl<sup>‒</sup> channel requires PKA phosphorylation at the regulatory (R) domain to relieve inhibition of ATP-dependent channel activity. This study aimed to identify the primary inhibitory site that prevents channel activation. CFTR mutants with deletion of residues 760 to 783 (ΔR<sub>760-783</sub>) elicited constitutive macroscopic and single-channel Cl<sup>‒</sup> currents in the presence of ATP before PKA phosphorylation, suggesting that protein segment R<sub>760-783</sub> in the R domain blocks CFTR activation. With the background of ΔR<sub>760-835</sub>, further deletion of R<sub>708-759</sub> led to fully active channels in the presence of ATP, but the absence of PKA, suggesting that R<sub>708-759</sub> prevents the activation of ΔR<sub>760-835</sub>-CFTR. R<sub>760-783</sub> peptides were unstructured in buffered solutions in CD spectroscopy and the N771P mutation that interrupts the α-helix formation induced no apparent constitutive current before PKA phosphorylation. These data suggest that interpeptide interactions by α-helices likely contribute trivially to the blocking effect of R<sub>760-783</sub>. CFTR mutants with small deletions or alanine replacements containing any one of residues R<sup>766</sup> and S<sup>768</sup> in a PKA consensus sequence and M<sup>773</sup> and T<sup>774</sup> generated PKA-independent CFTR Cl<sup>‒</sup> currents. Similarly, introducing the mutations Q767C or T774C into a control CFTR construct produced constitutive CFTR Cl<sup>‒</sup> currents by positively charged 2-(trimethylammonium)ethylmethanethiosulfonate modification of target cysteines. Moreover, PKA-independent single-channel activity was evidently observed in R766K-, S768K-, and T774K-CFTR mutants. Therefore, the four residues, R<sup>766</sup>, S<sup>768</sup>, M<sup>773</sup>, and T<sup>774</sup>, may form an inhibitory module that precludes CFTR activation through side-chain interactions. This inhibitory mechanism might be emulated by other PKA-dependent proteins."

We evaluated <sup>11</sup>C-<i>para</i>-aminobenzoic acid (<sup>11</sup>C-PABA), a chemically identical radioanalog of PABA, to detect and localize infections due to <i>M. abscessus</i>. <i>In vitro</i> uptake assays were performed to test the metabolism and accumulation of PABA into <i>M. abscessus</i> reference and clinical isolates. Dynamic <sup>11</sup>C-PABA positron emission tomography (PET) was performed in a mouse model of <i>M. abscessus</i> pulmonary infection and in a patient with microbiologically-confirmed <i>M. abscessus</i> pulmonary infection (NCT05611905). <sup>11</sup>C-PABA was intracellularly metabolized by <i>M. abscessus</i> to <sup>11</sup>C-7,8-dihydropteroate.

    "abstract": "Intercellular communication is important for host immunity in response to bacterial infections. Nontuberculous mycobacterium (NTM), such as <i>Mycobacterium abscessus</i> (<i>M. ab</i>), is a group of environmental bacteria that can cause severe lung infections in individuals with pre-existing lung conditions, including cystic fibrosis (CF) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). There is limited knowledge understanding the interaction between airway epithelial cells and immune cells during NTM infections. In this study, we characterized microvesicles (MVs) released from uninfected and <i>M. ab</i>-infected human bronchial epithelial cells and investigated the effect of these MVs on the activation and polarization of THP-1-derived macrophages in cell culture. Our results indicate that MVs released by <i>M. ab</i>-infected human bronchial epithelial cells stimulated the activation of M2-polarized macrophages in cell culture when compared to MVs released by uninfected cells. Additionally, the proteomic analysis for isolated MVs showed that the proteins involved in the cell adhesion pathway were enriched in MVs from <i>M. ab</i>-infected human bronchial epithelial cells compared to MVs from uninfected cells. Among those, the cell surface protein, intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), regulated the uptake of MVs released by <i>M. ab</i>-infected human bronchial epithelial cells by recipient macrophages in cell culture. In conclusion, our data suggest that in response to <i>M. ab</i> infection, human airway epithelial cells release MVs to modulate the activation of macrophages, which are key cells for mycobacterial intracellular survival in the host."

    "abstract": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease caused by mutations in the CFTR gene, leading to multisystemic complications, particularly in the lungs. CFTR dysfunction results in altered ion transport, chronic inflammation, and progressive lung damage. The triple therapy elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI) has demonstrated significant improvements in pulmonary function and quality of life. This study aimed to evaluate the anti-inflammatory effects of ETI by analysing systemic cytokine profiles over 12 months. A prospective study included 32 CF patients ≥ 18 years with at least one delF508 mutation, undergoing ETI therapy. Clinical stability was ensured prior to therapy initiation. Demographic data, BMI (Body Mass Index), FEV1% (Forced expiratory Volume in the first second), VR/TLC (residual volume/total lung capacity) and sweat chloride concentrations were recorded at baseline, 6 months and 12 months. Inflammatory markers, including fibrinogen, C-reactive protein (CRP), and a panel of 8 cytokines, were measured using multiplex bead-based immunoassays and electrochemiluminescence. Longitudinal changes were analysed using mixed-effects models and statistical tests, with significance set at p < 0.05. During a 12-month follow-up, the neutrophils number and proinflammatory biomarkers analyzed, fibrinogen, CRP, GM-CSF, IFN- γ, IL-1 α, IL-1 β, IL-8 (CXCL8), IL-12p70, IL-17A (CTLA-8), and TNF-α, significantly decreased, while eosinophils remained stable. Mixed-effects models confirmed the significant association of inflammatory biomarkers with FEV1, BMI, sweat chloride levels, and VR/TLC highlighting the role of inflammation in the progression of CF. ETI demonstrated marked anti-inflammatory effects in CF patients, reducing systemic inflammation and improving clinical parameters."

    "abstract": "Chronic suppurative lung disease (CSLD) is an umbrella term to define the spectrum of endobronchial suppurative lung disease, including bronchiectasis and protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB), associated with chronic wet or productive cough. Research that explores new therapeutic options in children with CSLD has been identified by clinicians and patients as one of the top research priorities. Mucolytic agents work to improve mucociliary clearance and interrupt the vicious vortex of airway infection and inflammation, hence they have potential as a therapeutic option. To assess the effects of mucolytics for reducing exacerbations, improving quality of life and other clinical outcomes in children with CSLD (including PBB and bronchiectasis), and to assess the risk of harm due to adverse events. An Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Airways Trials Register to June 2022, and a review author searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and Embase databases to 27 September 2024. Other review authors handsearched respiratory journals. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), of both cross-over and parallel design, that compared a mucolytic with a placebo or 'no intervention' control group and included children (aged 18 years and under) with any type of CSLD (including PBB and bronchiectasis). We excluded studies with adult participants and studies in children with cystic fibrosis, empyema, pulmonary abscess or bronchopulmonary fistula. Two authors independently reviewed titles and abstracts to assess eligibility for inclusion. The authors then assessed study quality and extracted data. They assessed the quality of the study using the Cochrane risk of bias tool (RoB 2), and used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence. Outcomes of interest to be analysed included: i) for maintenance or stable state: rate of exacerbations, ii) for exacerbation state: time to resolution of respiratory exacerbation, iii) lung function - forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) and forced vital capacity (FVC), iv) quality of life and v) adverse events. Only one study met the inclusion criteria, so we could not perform a meta-analysis. Data were continuous, so we reported outcomes as mean differences. The sole included RCT was a cross-over study of 63 children in the total cohort, with reported data and analysis of only 52 children (26 per arm) with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis. The study compared 3% hypertonic saline nebulised before chest physiotherapy with a control arm (physiotherapy alone), with each phase lasting eight weeks. Children in the hypertonic saline arm had a mean age of 9.80 (SD 2.97) years and 42.3% were male; those in the control arm had a mean age of 9.10 (SD 2.40) years and 38.4% were male. Only results of the first arm of the cross-over study were included in this review. The RCT reported a clinically important difference between the groups for our review's primary outcome: rate of respiratory exacerbations. The mean number of exacerbations per child-year was 2.50 (SD 0.64) in the intervention group and 7.80 (SD 1.05) in the control group (mean difference (MD) -5.30, 95% CI -5.77 to -4.83; 1 study, 52 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The RCT also reported that the percentage point improvement in mean % predicted FEV<sub>1</sub> and FVC from baseline to week eight was better with hypertonic saline compared to control. Mean FEV<sub>1</sub> improvement was 14.15% (SD 5.50) in the intervention group versus 5.04% (SD 5.55) in the control group (MD 9.11%, 95% CI 6.11 to 12.11; 1 study, 52 participants; very low-certainty evidence). While for FVC, the mean improvement was 13.77% (SD 5.73) compared with 7.54% (SD 4.90), respectively (MD 6.23%, 95% CI 3.33 to 9.13; 1 study, 52 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Quality of life measures were not used. We judged the study to have a high risk of bias due to unblinding, missing data, deviation from the intended intervention and reporting bias with measurement and selection of outcome measures. The authors reported that there were no dropouts due to adverse events. No data were available regarding quality of life. The included study assessed mucolytic use during a stable state, and we found no studies of mucolytic use during an exacerbation. We also found no studies assessing oral mucolytics, other inhaled mucolytics, use in PBB, or in settings other than hospital outpatients. We also found two ongoing studies, one using hypertonic saline and one using an oral mucolytic agent erdosteine, which will potentially be included in future updates of this review. This systematic review is limited to a single small study, which we judged to be at high risk of bias. It remains uncertain whether regular nebulised hypertonic saline during a stable state reduces exacerbations or improves lung function. Further multi-centre, well-designed RCTs of longer duration that investigate various mucolytics are required to answer this important clinical question."

    "abstract": "Pancreatitis is a prominent and severe type of inflammatory disorder that has grabbed a lot of scientific and clinical interest to prevent its onset. It should be detected early to avoid the development of serious complications, which occur due to long-term damage to the pancreas. The accurate measurement of biomarkers that are released from the pancreas during inflammation is essential for the detection and early treatment of patients with severe acute and chronic pancreatitis, but this is sub-optimally performed in clinically relevant practices, mainly due to the complexity of the procedure and the cost of the treatment. Clinically available tests for the early detection of pancreatitis are often time-consuming. The early detection of pancreatitis also relates to disorders of the exocrine pancreas, such as cystic fibrosis in the hereditary form and cystic fibrosis-like syndrome in the acquired form of pancreatitis, which are genetic disorders with symptoms that can be correlated with the overexpression of specific markers such as creatinine in biological fluids like urine. In this review, we studied how to develop a minimally invasive system using hydrogel-based biosensors, which are highly absorbent and biocompatible polymers that can respond to specific stimuli such as enzymes, pH, temperature, or the presence of biomarkers. These biosensors are helpful for real-time health monitoring and medical diagnostics since they translate biological reactions into quantifiable data. This paper also sheds light on the possible use of Ayurvedic formulations along with hydrogels as a treatment strategy. These analytical devices can be used to enhance the early detection of severe pancreatitis in real time."

Participants performed home spirometry using a portable flow sensor spirometer over a one-year period, without supervision. Spirometry readings from portable spirometers were compared with the nearest in-clinic spirometry using the intra-correlation coefficient (ICC) and Bland-Altman plots. Data were collected over a period of one year, with regular intervals of measurements. <b>Results</b>: In 427 of the 877 (48.6%) attempted sessions, successful spirometry at home was recorded. Although we showed good reliability between at-home and in-clinic measurements using the Bland-Altman plots and intraclass correlation co-efficient (ICC) (values ranged from 0.76 to 0.88), analysis of the 117 pairs of at-home and in-clinic spirometries showed that mean differences of forced expiratory volume in the 1st sec (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) obtained at home (both in liter and z-score) had, on average, lower values than the corresponding values at the clinic. <b>Conclusions</b>: Home-based telehealth spirometry is feasible among pwCF and provides advantages, especially for those from remote or secluded areas. However, lower values in FVC and FEV1 obtained through home spirometry should not be used interchangeably with clinic values."

The development of novel therapeutic treatments has improved DLBCL prognosis, but patients with early relapse or refractory disease have a poor outcome (with a mortality of around 40%). Metabolic reprogramming is a hallmark of cancer cells. Fatty acid (FA) metabolism is frequently altered in cancer cells and recently emerged as a critical survival path for cancer cell survival. <b>Methods:</b> We first performed the metabolic characterization of an extended panel of DLBCL cell lines, including lipid droplet content. Then, we investigated the effect of drugs targeting FA metabolism on DLBCL cell survival. Further, we studied how the combination of drugs targeting FA and either mitochondrial metabolism or mTOR pathway impacts on DLBCL cell death. <b>Results:</b> Here, we reveal, using a large panel of DLBCL cell lines characterized by their metabolic status, that targeting of FA metabolism induces massive DLBCL cell death regardless of their OxPhos or BCR/glycolytic subtype. Further, FA drives resistance of DLBCL cell death induced by mitochondrial stress upon treatment with either metformin or L-asparaginase, two FDA-approved antimetabolic drugs. Interestingly, combining inhibition of FA metabolism with that of the mTOR oncogenic pathway strongly potentiates DLBCL cell death. <b>Conclusion:</b> Altogether, our data highlight the central role played by FA metabolism in DLBCL cell survival, independently of their metabolic subtype, and provide the framework for the use of drugs targeting this metabolic vulnerability to overcome resistance in DLBCL patients."

Additionally, this review critically examines potential drug-vitamin D interactions in the context of rare disease patient polypharmacy. <b>Results:</b> Evidence suggests that vitamin D deficiency is prevalent in rare disease patient populations, often at once exacerbating and being simultaneously exacerbated by the underlying condition. Vitamin D deficiency correlates with worse clinical outcomes and lower quality of life across the examined diseases. Immunoregulatory properties of vitamin D appear relevant for rare diseases with autoimmune components. <b>Conclusions:</b> An urgent need for developing disease-specific clinical practice guidelines, implementing routine vitamin D monitoring in rare disease patient care, and introducing tailored supplementation under the principles of precision medicine is emphasized."

This study aims to provide an overview of technology use and factors associated to its use, diabetes management, and psychosocial aspects experienced by adults aged 50 and over living with type 1 diabetes or latent autoimmune diabetes in adults. This cross-sectional study analyzed data from the Canadian BETTER registry, mostly based on self-reported outcomes from individuals living with type 1 diabetes or latent autoimmune diabetes in adults. Comparative analyses were conducted across 3 age groups: 50-59, 60-69, and ≥ 70. Participants (n = 674) were predominantly Caucasian (97% to 98% across groups) and residing in Quebec, Canada (71% to 79%).

Level 2 hypoglycemia events in the last month were more frequent among participants aged 50-59 years compared to those aged ≥70 years (6.9 vs 3.4, P = .001). Level 3 hypoglycemia, social and professional support were similar between groups. Interestingly, diabetes-related distress was lower in older age groups. Most individuals in this cohort adopted technology use but in lower proportion among the group aged ≥70. Overall, diabetes management was good and similar between age groups."

    "title": "The association between dysglycaemia and exercise capacity in cystic fibrosis.",
    "abstract": "People with cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD) are known to have reduced exercise capacity (EC), which in turn is related to increased morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study was to examine whether dysglycaemia may independently influence exercise capacity in people with CF (pwCF). Results from clinically conducted cardiopulmonary exercise tests were analysed retrospectively in 139 pwCF alongside routine clinical data. Subjects were grouped according to glycaemic status; normal glucose tolerance (NGT; n = 43) and dysglycaemia; impaired glucose tolerance (IGT; n = 17) and CFRD (n = 79). Anthropometric data was assessed using chi-squared tests. Regression models were developed using analysis of co-variance (ANCOVA) to evaluate predictors of exercise capacity and correlations between variable were assessed using the Pearson method. Maximal oxygen uptake (VO<sub>2max</sub>) was reduced in the CFRD group compared to NGT and IGT (p < 0.01), however this was dependent on higher FEV<sub>1</sub> % in the NGT and IGT groups (p < 0.001) and significant differences were no longer present when FEV<sub>1</sub> was accounted for. A higher proportion of those with dysglycaemia were ventilatory limited (NGT; 42 %, IGT; 72 % & CFRD; 65 %, p < 0.05). Age, gender, BMI, intravenous antibiotic days and FEV<sub>1</sub> % were significant predictors of VO<sub>2max</sub> across all patients (adjusted R<sup>2</sup> = 0.528, p < 0.001). HbA1<sub>c</sub> is a small but significant predictor of VO<sub>2max</sub> in patients with dysglycaemia (p < 0.05). Adults with CFRD have reduced VO<sub>2max</sub> compared to NGT or IGT which is mediated by poorer lung function and higher overall disease burden. In individuals with CFRD, better glycaemic control is associated with a greater EC."

    "abstract": "Novel therapies have increased life expectancy for people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF), shifting care to adult providers with limited CF experience. Hospitalizations expose trainees to CF care, but educational tools for managing CF exacerbations are scarce. A six-year longitudinal study assessed internal medicine resident physician trainees' (RPTs) experience managing hospitalized pwCF. A mixed-method survey of RPTs informed the creation of educational and workflow tools, including a video didactic and order set. A targeted knowledge assessment measured the effectiveness of these tools. Multidisciplinary team meetings also tracked challenges and outcomes. Among 48 RPTs surveyed, 83% cared for pwCF during training. Most reported less comfort managing pwCF compared to diseases like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Immediately after implementing targeted educational tools, knowledge scores improved, particularly in CF-related diabetes management (38.4% correct pre vs 61.5% correct post, p=0.04). Rare disease education requires focused assessments of learners' needs, sustained reinforcement, and adaptable tools to maintain effectiveness."

    "title": "Monitoring cardiovascular disease risk in children with cystic fibrosis using arterial stiffness: A new perspective.",
    "abstract": "Early diagnosis with newborn screening programs and prolonged life expectancy with new treatment strategies have made cardiovascular disease (CVD) one of the important issues in cystic fibrosis (CF). In the early stages of CVD, it is difficult to recognize and follow-up increased arterial stiffness with conventional methods. Different measurement methods are needed. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to use arterial stiffness measurements in the follow-up of children with CF. This is a follow-up study examining the changes in arterial stiffness in children with CF by repeating hemodynamic measurements [augmentation index (AIx) and pulse wave velocity (PWV)]. We repeated hemodynamic measurements and CF-related CVD risk factors (Atherosclerosis risk factors: Fasting blood sugar, lipid profiles, and HbA1c) and systemic inflammation markers [C-reactive protein (CRP) and immunoglobulin G and pulmonary function tests] in children undergoing routine annual complication evaluation and examined changes during follow-up. Hemodynamic measurements could be repeated in 37 of 52 patients due to inclusion criteria. Mean age of the study group was 12 ± 4.5 years and 48.6% were female. There was a statistically significant increase in high density lipoprotein, HbA1c, and CRP and a decrease in low density lipoprotein and FEV1 at the follow-up. Heart rate, central blood pressure, augmented pressure, and PWV were similar. AIx, peripheral systolic blood pressure (SBP), and mean arterial pressure were increased significantly (p< 0.05). The increase in AIx was greater than expected for age and greater in female patients and in those with low body mass index, moderate-severe disease, and high CRP levels. Also, the change in AIx was positively correlated with changes in peripheral SBP and CRP. This is the first study to evaluate the use of PWV and AIx in the follow-up of children with CF and showed that arterial stiffness measured with AIx increased at follow-up. The use of markers of arterial stiffness in CF from childhood onwards may enable early detection and monitoring of CVD risk and future prevention."

    "title": "Antibiotic treatment for non-tuberculous mycobacteria lung infection in people with cystic fibrosis.",
    "abstract": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a common genetic condition in which progressive lung disease leads to morbidity and mortality. Non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are mycobacteria, other than those in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, and are commonly found in the environment. NTM pulmonary infections affect a significant proportion of people with CF worldwide, which may be associated with a more rapid decline in lung function and even death in certain circumstances. Although there are guidelines for the antimicrobial treatment of NTM lung disease, there is no specific evidence from studies of people with CF to inform recommendations for their treatment. It is not clear which antibiotic regimen may be the most effective in the treatment of people with CF. This is an update of a previous review. To compare antibiotic treatment to no antibiotic treatment, or to compare different combinations of antibiotic treatment, for suppressing or eradicating non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) lung infections in people with cystic fibrosis (CF). We searched Cochrane's Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, online databases (MEDLINE, Embase and PubMed) and online trials registries (www. gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry). We also searched the reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews. The date of the last search was 14 October 2024. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs with a parallel design; non-randomised studies of interventions (NRSIs) with the following designs: instrumental variables; regression discontinuity; interrupted time series; difference-in-differences and fixed-effect designs. These should have compared antibiotic treatment to no antibiotic treatment, or different combinations of antibiotic treatment, in people with CF of any age with NTM pulmonary infection. We aimed to assess the critical outcomes of microbiological clearance of NTM in sputum, quality of life, adverse events, lung function and pulmonary exacerbations. Further, we planned to assess important outcomes of mortality, nutritional parameters, hospitalisations and use of additional oral antibiotics. We planned to use the recommended Cochrane tools for RCTs or NRSIs. These were not suitable for the included study, so we assessed the risk of bias using a tool for case series developed by the Joanna Briggs Institute. We were only able to report the limited results from the single included study narratively. We assessed the certainty of the results using GRADE. Due to a lack of studies of the types planned, we were only able to include a single retrospective case review, which presented data as the change from baseline for some outcomes. It was conducted in Sweden in 2003 and included 11 participants with CF and NTM infection (three males) aged between 10 and 36 years. The study identified the specific cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) mutation for 10 participants. All participants were chronically colonised with Pseudomonas aeruginosa; 10 participants had been vaccinated with the Bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccine. Antibiotic selection differed amongst participants and was determined according to in vitro susceptibility testing. Antibiotics included isoniazid, ethambutol, rifampicin (or rifabutin), amikacin, clarithromycin, ciprofloxacin, streptomycin and clofazimine. Of note, at the start of the study, isoniazid was the standard treatment for NTM, and three participants received this drug; however, investigators stated that following severe adverse effects, the drug was excluded in the latter part of the 1980s. Investigators reported data for lung function, weight and adverse events one year before NTM diagnosis, at baseline, at completion of therapy and at the latest follow-up (ranging from one to 14 years). Treatment was considered effective if NTM was cleared and cultures remained negative throughout treatment; it was considered to have failed if there were continued or sporadic positive cultures. We graded all the evidence as very low and are very uncertain of the effects of the different antibiotic regimens on any of the outcomes reported. The study reported that in 10/11 participants, microbiological cultures turned negative. They also stated that five participants reported adverse events; three reported photosensitivity to ciprofloxacin, while each of the following events was reported by one of the five participants: impaired hearing, convulsions, neuropathy and lupus erythematous. There was no consistent effect on lung function. Investigators reported that forced expiratory volume in one second increased by between 1% predicted and 46% predicted in six participants, decreased between 2% predicted and 31% predicted in four participants and remained the same in one participant. They also reported that forced vital capacity increased in eight participants by between 3% predicted and 53% predicted, and decreased in three participants by between 4% predicted and 21% predicted. Two participants died as a result of progression of CF respiratory disease two years after completion of therapy. A further participant died of gastrointestinal bleeding and renal insufficiency eight years after lung transplant which followed clearance of NTM infection (negative NTM cultures were maintained until death). Eight participants gained weight (range 3.30 kg to 14.00 kg), while three participants lost weight (range -0.90 kg to -6.00 kg). Investigators additionally reported body mass index values in three participants, which decreased minimally in two participants and increased slightly in the third participant. The very low-certainty evidence identified in this review suggests that antimicrobial treatment may lead to sputum clearance of NTM in people with CF, but may result in variable clinical response in terms of lung function. Very low-certainty evidence also suggests that adverse events may be common, necessitating close monitoring. This review highlights the need for larger, more standardised studies in order to make meaningful comparisons between treatment regimens. Although microbiological clearance seems feasible, studies should be powered to detect relevant clinical outcomes as well. Cochrane CF received funding from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation for a series of reviews on NTM, of which the update of this review is one. The protocol for this updated version of the review was registered at PROSPERO in November 2023."

    "abstract": "As life expectancy following lung transplantation (LT) improves, vulnerability to glucocorticoid-induced osteoporotic fractures is increased. Our institution offers LT recipients protocolized antiresorptive therapy, with zoledronic acid (ZA) used first line. Adults who underwent LT from January 2012 to December 2018 and survived at least 6 months were retrospectively studied. Coprimary outcomes were incidence, prevalence, and predictors of osteoporotic fractures and major osteoporotic fractures post-LT. Four hundred and five LT recipients (41% female, median age 59 years) had a median follow-up of 4.9 years (interquartile range 3.4-6.7). Osteoporotic fracture prevalence was 12% (<i>n</i> = 49) pre-LT and 15% (<i>n</i> = 60) post-LT. Major osteoporotic fracture post-LT occurred in 11% (<i>n</i> = 45). Antiresorptive therapy was received by 47% pre- and 89% post-LT. On multivariate analysis, risk factors for osteoporotic fracture were pre-LT osteoporotic fracture (hazard ratio (HR) 2.32 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.09-4.96)), female sex (HR 2.08 (95% CI 1.09-3.94)), glucocorticoid use pre-LT (HR 2.08 (95% CI 1.09-3.99)), and time (months) to first ZA infusion post-LT (HR 1.04 (95% CI 1.01-1.06)). Risk factors for major osteoporotic fracture were pre-LT osteoporotic fracture, female sex, age, and time to first ZA infusion. LT recipients receiving protocolized antiresorptive treatment post-LT had a low incidence of osteoporotic fracture."

Given the persistence of extrapulmonary symptoms post-LTx, this prospective study aims to investigate the benefits and safety of ETI for PwCF post-LTx. Between Nov 2022-Nov 2023 ETI was offered to PwCF post-LTx with at least one F508del mutation in 3 Dutch LTx centers. PwCF were considered eligible if they had either a BMI ≤ 19 kg/m², chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), uncontrolled diabetes or gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. BMI, HbA1c, SNOT-22 score, GI Symptom Tracker, CF Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R), FEV<sub>1</sub>, creatinine, changes in calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) doses and levels were compared between baseline and 3 months follow-up. Fifty-five PwCF post-LTx were included, of whom 5 were excluded because of ETI discontinuation due to side effects, within 3 month follow-up. Three months results showed a decrease in SNOT-22 score (<i>p</i>< 0.001) and GI symptoms (all 4, <i>p</i>< 0.05), an increase in BMI (<i>p</i>= 0.012) and CFQ-R (6 domains, <i>p</i>< 0.05). Median CNI daily dose had to be reduced from 6 to 4 mg (<i>p</i>< 0.001), to maintain stable CNI trough levels. Creatinine increased from 110 (87-141) to 115 (92-125) umol/L (<i>p</i>= 0.002). ETI for PwCF post-LTx shows favorable effects on CRS, GI symptoms, and quality of life, but not on BMI and HbA1c. Due to its high cost, careful consideration and further studies are required.

This study aims to analyze pre-transplant predictors and post-transplant outcomes of ConLi-LTx and lung transplant (LTx) only in pediatric patients with cystic fibrosis. The ISHLT International Thoracic Organ Transplant Registry was queried for patients <18 years old with CF who underwent ConLi-LTx and LTx-only from 1994-June 2018. Data were propensity matched to LTx-only controls and analyzed with Fisher's exact, Wilcoxon rank sum tests, Kaplan-Meier methods, and Cox proportional hazards where appropriate. We identified 18 ConLi-LTx who were compared to 72 LTx-only cases. No significant differences were identified in patient demographics, resting oxygen requirement prior to transplant, or six-minute walking distance at time of listing. Interestingly, ConLi-LTx patients demonstrated significantly improved overall (p=0.0220) and BOS-free survival (p=0.0167). There were no differences in pre-transplant predictors of simultaneous liver and lung transplantation in pediatric patients with cystic fibrosis compared to those who received LTx-only. The noted survival benefits of ConLi-LTx remains uncertain, as patients who underwent simultaneous transplant are likely well-selected as candidates for such an extensive procedure, and we hypothesize that the liver may play a role in immunologic benefit. Further research is warranted regarding pre-transplant characteristics of pediatric cystic fibrosis patients who may be considered for concomitant liver with lung transplant."

    "abstract": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive condition leading to progressive lung disease and often necessitating lung transplantation. Historically, CF has been one of the leading indications for lung transplants in the United States. The advent of CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators, particularly elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor (ETI), has significantly improved clinical outcomes for people with CF (pwCF), offering potential alterations in disease progression and transplantation needs. Data on lung transplants performed in the United States since 1988 were retrieved from the Organ Procurement & Transplantation Network. Custom reports were generated to compare the number of lung transplants and waitlist additions before and after ETI approval in 2019. The analysis focused on trends from 2009-2019 (pre-ETI) and 2021-2023 (post-ETI). The average annual lung transplants for CF decreased significantly from 243 (2009-2019) to 56.7 (2021-2023) post-ETI approval. Similarly, the average number of pwCF added to the lung transplant waitlist per year dropped from 295 to 55.6. Despite an overall increase in lung transplants and waitlist additions in the United States, the proportion involving pwCF has markedly declined post-ETI. The introduction of ETI has dramatically reduced the need for lung transplants among pwCF, reflecting significant improvements in lung function and disease management. These findings underscore the transformative impact of CFTR modulators like ETI on the natural history of CF, highlighting the importance of continued advancements in precision medicine for genetic disorders. Future studies should investigate long-term outcomes and sustained trends in lung transplantation needs among pwCF."

Despite this, comprehensive post-marketing assessments of its adverse drug events (ADEs) remain insufficient. This study aims to analyze the ADEs associated with ETI using the U.S. FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). We conducted a pharmacovigilance analysis utilizing FAERS data from Q4 2019 to Q3 2024. Reports of ADEs related to ETI were extracted, and disproportionality analyses-including Reporting Odds Ratio (ROR), Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR), Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN), and Multi-item Gamma Poisson Shrinker (MGPS)-were employed to evaluate signal strength. Additionally, a time-to-onset (TTO) analysis was performed. A total of 28,366 ETI-related ADEs were identified, spanning 27 organ systems. We identified 322 positive signals, with signals consistent with the drug label including headache (702 cases, ROR 2.75), infective pulmonary exacerbation of CF (691 cases, ROR 384.24), rash (538 cases, ROR 2.72), and cough (507 cases, ROR 3.79). Unexpected signals were also noted, such as anxiety (494 cases, ROR 4.16), depression (364 cases, ROR 4.59), insomnia (281 cases ROR 2.83), nephrolithiasis (79 cases, ROR 3.63) and perinatal depression (4 cases, ROR 13.59). The TTO analysis indicated that the median onset of ADEs was 70 days, with 37.08% occurring within the first month. Subgroup analyses revealed that females exhibited a higher reporting rank for mental disorder and constipation, whereas in males, they were insomnia, abdominal pain, and nasopharyngitis. This study highlights both recognized and unexpected ADEs associated with ETI, underscoring the necessity for ongoing monitoring, particularly concerning psychiatric conditions. The subgroup analysis suggests a need for personalized treatment strategies to optimize patient care."

Our study explores the use of adenine base editing to edit G542X to a non-CF-causing variant, G542R, and recover CFTR function. Using base editor engineered virus-like particles (BE-eVLPs) in patient-derived intestinal organoids, we achieved ∼2% G542X-to-G542R editing efficiency and restored CFTR-mediated chloride transport to ∼6.4% of wild-type levels, independent of modulator treatment, and with no bystander edits.

There is a need for better therapeutics as well as biomarkers to enable effective stratification of CMV seropositive patient risk for developing CMV DNAemia to inform prophylaxis duration. CMV-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) binding and functional responses were evaluated in a discovery cohort of longitudinal plasma samples from 51 CMV seropositive human lung transplant recipients, collected as part of the clinical trials in organ transplantation (CTOT)-20 and CTOT-22 consortium studies. Pre-transplant plasma from an additional 43 CMV seropositive lung transplant recipients was evaluated as a validation cohort. In the discovery cohort with longitudinal samples, pre-transplant plasma IgG binding to CMV surface glycoproteins glycoprotein H (gH)/glycoprotein L (gL), gH/gL/glycoprotein O (gO), and pentameric complex, as well as neutralization of CMV in epithelial cells, is associated with increased risk of CMV DNAemia post-prophylaxis. However, these results were not confirmed by the validation cohort. While quantification of pre-transplant CMV-specific antibody responses showed association with DNAemia in the discovery cohort, additional clinical variables and/or known risk factors for CMV, such as patient CMV-specific T-cell responses, may need to be considered in combination with humoral immunity to effectively stratify risk of CMV DNAemia."

We utilized the Lung Transplant Outcomes Group cohort of 1,538 subjects from 2011-2018. We evaluated the association between preoperative BMI and graft survival among subjects with severe PGD using Cox proportional hazards models with linear splines. Models were stratified by center and adjusted for sex, age, Lung Allocation Score, and diagnosis. PGD developed in 383 subjects. Among subjects with PGD, low BMI was associated with increased mortality while high BMI was not associated with differential mortality, compared to normal BMI. Results were similar for 90-day and 1-year survival. While high BMI increases the risk of developing PGD, it does not appear to be associated with survival after PGD. Future work should focus on PGD prevention rather than PGD management in patients with obesity."

In this study, we sought to evaluate the incidence of perioperative MACCE and CRB in lung transplant recipients who underwent ECMO BTT. Using the National Inpatient Sample from 2008-2019, we identified 5,254 lung transplant recipients who either received or did not require pretransplant ECMO. Perioperative MACCE and CRB were compared between the 2 cohorts. Patients with ECMO BTT had a higher incidence of MACCE compared to non-ECMO patients (35% vs 13.3%, <i>p</i> < 0.0001) and CRB (34.5% vs 12.9%, <i>p</i> < 0.0001).

Main and interaction effects were evaluated and adjusted across candidate age, sex, and diagnosis.

Model discrimination and calibration measures were compared. Interactions between donor and recipient factors emerged by age: lower survival for donation after circulatory death organs for recipients aged 55 to 69 years, donor smoking for recipients aged 30 to 54 and 70+, Hispanic donor for recipients <30, non-Hispanic Black donor for recipients aged 30+; sex: cytomegalovirus mismatch for males; diagnosis: higher donor recipient weight ratio for diagnosis group C (e.g., cystic fibrosis), donor diabetes for diagnosis group D (e.g., idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis). COX and RF models performed similarly to PT-CAS; however, the combined COX + PT-CAS model had improved discrimination (1-year area under the receiver operator characteristic curve [AUC] PT-CAS 0.609 vs 1-year AUC COX + PT-CAS 0.626) and improved calibration across a broader range of predicted risk. The influence of donor factors on recipient PT survival differed by age, sex, and diagnosis. The addition of donor factors to existing models predicting PT survival led to only modest improvement in prediction accuracy. Future efforts may focus on optimizing matching strategies to improve donor utilization."

The interactions may involve the potential inhibition of cytochrome P450 isoenzymes (CYPs), organic anion-transporting polypeptides (OATPs), and Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP) by ETI. This presents a therapeutic challenge in CF due to the potential for elevated statin levels, consequently heightening the risk of myopathy. This study aimed to predict potential DDIs between statins and ETI using a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling approach. <b>Methods:</b> We performed in vitro assays to measure the inhibitory potency of ETI against OATPs and CYP2C9 and incorporated these data into our PBPK models alongside published inhibitory parameters for BCRP and CYP3A4. <b>Results:</b> The PBPK simulation showed that atorvastatin had the highest predicted AUC ratio (3.27), followed by pravastatin (2.27), pitavastatin (2.24), and rosuvastatin (1.83). <b>Conclusions:</b> Based on these findings, rosuvastatin appears to exhibit a weak interaction with ETI, whereas other statins exhibited a moderate interaction, potentially requiring appropriate dose reductions. These data indicate potential clinically significant DDIs between ETI and certain statins, which warrants a clinical study to validate these findings."

Infections due to <i>Inquilinus</i> spp. are increasingly identified, especially in patients with cystic fibrosis. This review aims to present all reported cases of <i>Inquilinus</i> spp. infections in humans, with an emphasis on data regarding epidemiology, antimicrobial resistance, antimicrobial treatment, and mortality. A narrative review based on a literature search of the PubMed/MedLine and Scopus databases was performed. In total, 13 articles providing data on 25 patients with <i>Inquilinus</i> infections were included in the analysis. The median age was 19 years, while 60% were male. Cystic fibrosis was the predominant risk factor (92%). Respiratory tract infection was the most common type of infection (96%). <i>Inquilinus limosus</i> was the most commonly identified species. Polymicrobial infection was very common (77.3%). Microbial identification required the use of advanced molecular techniques, such as 16s rRNA sequencing. The pathogen exhibited resistance to beta-lactams, with the exception of carbapenems. The most commonly used antimicrobials included carbapenems (68.4%), followed by quinolones (57.9%) and aminoglycosides (52.6%). Mortality was low (4%). Due to the potential of <i>Inquilinus</i> spp. to cause infection in patients with cystic fibrosis, and given the difficulties in microbial identification, clinicians and laboratory professionals should consider it in the differential diagnosis of patients with cystic fibrosis and respiratory tract infection not responding to beta-lactam treatment or with polymicrobial infections, especially when traditional techniques are used for microbial identification."

It colonizes the lungs of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, establishing an ecological niche where it adapts and evolves from early to chronic stages, resulting in deteriorating lung function and frequent exacerbations. With antibiotics resistance on the rise, there is a pressing need for alternative personalized treatments (such as bacteriophage therapy) to combat <i>P. aeruginosa</i> infections. In this study, we aimed to isolate and characterize phages targeting both early and chronic <i>P. aeruginosa</i> isolates and evaluate their potential for phage therapy. Four highly virulent phages belonging to myoviral, podviral, and siphoviral morphotypes were isolated from sewage samples. These phages have a broad host range and effectively target 62.5% of the <i>P. aeruginosa</i> isolates with a positive correlation to the early isolates. All the phages have a virulence index of ≥0.90 (0.90-0.98), and one has a large burst size of 331 PFU/cell and a latency period of 30 min. All phages are stable under a wide range of temperature and pH conditions. Genomic analysis suggests the four phages are strictly lytic and devoid of identifiable temperate phage repressors and genes associated with antibiotic resistance and virulence. More significantly, two of the phages significantly delayed the onset of larval death when evaluated in a lethal <i>Galleria mellonella</i> infection model, suggesting their promise as phage therapy candidates for <i>P. aeruginosa</i> infections."

    "abstract": "<i>Background and Objectives</i>: Cystic fibrosis (CF), caused by CFTR gene mutations, primarily affects the respiratory and gastrointestinal systems. Microbiota modulation through probiotics, prebiotics, or synbiotics may help restore microbial diversity and reduce inflammation. This study aimed to evaluate their efficacy in CF. <i>Materials and Methods:</i> A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published between 2000 and 2024 was conducted in Cochrane, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, LILAC, BMC, PubMed, and SCOPUS following PRISMA guidelines. Methodological quality was assessed using the Jadad scale, and RevMan 5.4<sup>®</sup> estimated effects on pulmonary function (FEV<sub>1</sub>), exacerbations, hospitalizations, quality of life, and inflammatory markers. <i>Results</i>: Thirteen RCTs (<i>n</i> = 552), mostly in pediatric populations, were included. Most examined probiotics (e.g., <i>Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG</i>, <i>L. reuteri</i>), while four used synbiotics. Several studies reported reduced fecal calprotectin and proinflammatory interleukins (e.g., IL-6, IL-8), suggesting an anti-inflammatory effect. However, no significant differences were observed regarding hospitalizations or quality of life. Additionally, none of the studies documented serious adverse events associated with the intervention. The meta-analysis showed no significant decrease in exacerbations (RR = 0.81; 95% CI = 0.48-1.37; <i>p</i> = 0.43) or improvements in FEV<sub>1</sub> (MD = 4.7; 95% CI = -5.4 to 14.8; <i>p</i> = 0.37), even in subgroup analyses. Sensitivity analyses did not modify the effect of the intervention on pulmonary function or exacerbation frequency, supporting the robustness of the findings. <i>Conclusions</i>: Current evidence suggests that probiotics or synbiotics yield inconsistent clinical benefits in CF, although some reduction in inflammatory markers may occur. Larger, multicenter RCTs with longer follow-up are needed for clearer conclusions. Until more definitive evidence is available, these supplements should be considered experimental adjuncts rather than standard interventions for CF management."

    "abstract": "Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a life-shortening, multi-organ disease caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. Prominent clinical features of CF take place in the lung, hallmarked by cycles of bacterial infection and a dysfunctional inflammatory airway response, leading to eventual respiratory failure. Bidirectional crosstalk between epithelial cells, leukocytes (e.g., neutrophils, macrophages) and bacteria via release of intra-cellular mediators is key to driving inflammation in CF airways. In recent years, a highly effective combination of therapeutics targeting the CFTR defect have revolutionized treatment in CF. Despite these advancements and due to the complexity of the immune response in the CF airway, the full impact of highly effective modulator therapy (HEMT) on airway inflammation is not fully determined. This review provides the evidence to date on crosstalk mechanisms between host epithelium, leukocytes and bacteria and examines the effect of HEMT on both soluble and membrane-derived immune mediators in clinical samples. The varied effects of HEMT on expression of key proteases, cytokines and extracellular vesicles (EVs) in relation to clinical parameters is assessed. Advances in treatment with HEMT have shown potential in dampening the chronic inflammatory response in CF airways. However, to fully quell inflammation and maximize lung tissue resilience, further interventions may be necessary. Exploring the effects of HEMT on key immune mediators paves the way for identifying new anti-inflammatory approaches targeting host immune cell interactions, such as EV-directed lung therapies."

During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) lead to worldwide changes in respiratory virus epidemiology. However, evidence regarding virus circulation in the outpatient setting remains largely unknown. The aim of this study is to longitudinally assess respiratory viruses in healthy infants before and during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Switzerland. In this prospective observational birth cohort study, we followed 34 infants throughout the first year of life before and during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. We analysed 648 biweekly nasal swabs for nine different respiratory viruses by Multiplex-PCR and assessed respiratory symptoms, COVID-19 infections of family members and childcare status in weekly interviews. 712 nasal swabs from 32 infants analysed before the pandemic and published previously served as control group. During the period with strict NPIs (pandemic I), most common respiratory viruses were not detected, with a rebound (driven by Adenovirus and Parainfluenza virus) after most NPIs were relaxed (pandemic II): prepandemic: 27%, pandemic I: 19%, pandemic II: 33%; historic: 36% of collected swabs per period, p<0.001. Human rhinovirus (HRV) prevalence persisted during NPIs presence, mainly in the form of asymptomatic HRV detection: prepandemic=24%, pandemic I=19%, pandemic II=25%, historic: 25%, p=0.3. SARS-CoV-2 detection (asymptomatic and symptomatic) was low, and only present after NPIs were relaxed: pandemic II=2.4%. No severe COVID-19 infections were reported. In our cohort, infants did not contribute largely to spread of SARS-CoV-2. The role of persisting asymptomatic HRV prevalence is still unclear, but it might help to maintain population immunity to prevent more severe infections. Our results underscore the importance of capturing asymptomatic viruses via longitudinal community-based data assessment to better understand virus transmission."

    "abstract": "Lumacaftor and Ivacaftor are two FDA-approved medications currently used to treat cystic fibrosis (CF), a genetic disease caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a chloride ion channel located in epithelial cell membranes; however, the detailed mechanism(s) of their action remains to be elucidated. Both drugs, termed modulators, bind CFTR at a protein-lipid interface, yet Lumacaftor acts at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), while Ivacaftor acts at the plasma membrane (PM). A major difference among biological membranes is their level of cholesterol (viz., the ER, 5% cholesterol; the Golgi apparatus, 12.5%; and the PM, 30%). Therefore, we investigated the ability of each molecule to interact with membranes of the corresponding cholesterol content to determine if lipid cholesterol content provides a physical basis for their observed localized activity. Using differential scanning calorimetry and a terbium-based liposome disruption assay, we show that both Lumacaftor (a corrector) and Ivacaftor (a potentiator) penetrate/diffuse through membranes containing high cholesterol concentrations, such as in Golgi and the PM. The results further suggest that (1) Lumacaftor resides within membranes containing 5% cholesterol, supporting the proposition that Lumacaftor acts as a corrector of the CFTR channel at the ER level where the nascent protein is in its initial folding stage; and (2) Ivacaftor is well-suited to penetrate the PM and reach its binding pocket on CFTR. Our findings provide evidence that membrane cholesterol levels significantly modulate CFTR corrector/potentiator activity and consequently may affect sensitivity to clinical therapeutics in CF patients."

    "abstract": "The <i>Achromobacter</i> genus comprises 22 species and various genogroups. Some species with higher virulence or antibiotic resistance are more likely to cause chronic infections in people with cystic fibrosis (CF). Current identification methods often fail to accurately distinguish between the species or result in misidentifications due to biochemical similarities. This study aims to develop an accurate qPCR protocol for species-level identification that is applicable in clinical diagnostic laboratories. Whole-genome sequencing of clinical isolates from different <i>Achromobacter</i> species identified species-specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in two 16S gene regions. Based on these SNPs, two sets of primers and qPCR probes were designed to generate unique identification profiles. Thermal profiles were optimized, and qPCR was performed on serial bacterial DNA dilutions to determine the detection limit (LOD). Four probes successfully identified three species: <i>A. xylosoxidans</i>, <i>A. dolens</i>, and <i>A. insuavis</i>. Two additional probes were designed for novel genotypes unrelated to publicly available sequences. The LOD ranged from 0.005 pg/µL to 1 pg/µL. Combined probes achieved 100% sensitivity, with specificity ranging from 97.95% to 100%. This qPCR protocol enables accurate species identification, overcoming the limitations of current methods, and represents a reliable tool for clinical diagnostics."

    "abstract": "Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is the most common hereditary disorder that disrupts renal function and frequently progresses to end-stage renal disease. Recent advances have elucidated the critical role of primary cilia and ciliary ion channels, including transient receptor potential (TRP) channels, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), and polycystin channels, in the pathogenesis of PKD. While some channels primarily function as chloride conductance channels (e.g., CFTR), others primarily regulate calcium (Ca<sup>+2</sup>) homeostasis. These ion channels are essential for cellular signaling and maintaining the normal kidney architecture. Dysregulation of these pathways due to genetic mutations in <i>PKD1</i> and <i>PKD2</i> leads to disrupted Ca<sup>+2</sup> and cAMP signaling, aberrant fluid secretion, and uncontrolled cellular proliferation, resulting in tubular cystogenesis. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying these dysfunctions has opened the door for innovative therapeutic strategies, including TRPV4 activators, CFTR inhibitors, and calcimimetics, to mitigate cyst growth and preserve renal function. This review summarizes the current knowledge on the roles of ciliary ion channels in PKD pathophysiology, highlights therapeutic interventions targeting these channels, and identifies future research directions for improving patient outcomes."

    "title": "Proinflammatory Cytokines in Chronic Respiratory Diseases and Their Management.",
    "abstract": "Pulmonary homeostasis can be agitated either by external environmental insults or endogenous factors produced during respiratory/pulmonary diseases. The lungs counter these insults by initiating mechanisms of inflammation as a localized, non-specific first-line defense response. Cytokines are small signaling glycoprotein molecules that control the immune response. They are formed by numerous categories of cell types and induce the movement, growth, differentiation, and death of cells. During respiratory diseases, multiple proinflammatory cytokines play a crucial role in orchestrating chronic inflammation and structural changes in the respiratory tract by recruiting inflammatory cells and maintaining the release of growth factors to maintain inflammation. The issue aggravates when the inflammatory response is exaggerated and/or cytokine production becomes dysregulated. In such instances, unresolving and chronic inflammatory reactions and cytokine production accelerate airway remodeling and maladaptive outcomes. Pro-inflammatory cytokines generate these deleterious consequences through interactions with receptors, which in turn initiate a signal in the cell, triggering a response. The cytokine profile and inflammatory cascade seen in different pulmonary diseases vary and have become fundamental targets for advancement in new therapeutic strategies for lung diseases. There are considerable therapeutic approaches that target cytokine-mediated inflammation in pulmonary diseases; however, blocking specific cytokines may not contribute to clinical benefit. Alternatively, broad-spectrum anti-inflammatory approaches are more likely to be clinically effective. Herein, this comprehensive review of the literature identifies various cytokines (e.g., interleukins, chemokines, and growth factors) involved in pulmonary inflammation and the pathogenesis of respiratory diseases (e.g., asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary, lung cancer, pneumonia, and pulmonary fibrosis) and investigates targeted therapeutic treatment approaches."

As a secondary objective, the effect of cough induced by FET was evaluated by comparing respiratory mechanics and lung function between those who coughed and those who did not during the FET. A before-after clinical trial was conducted with children and adolescents with CF aged six to 15 years. Respiratory mechanics parameters were assessed using the impulse oscillometry system (IOS) in three stages: basal IOS, post-huff IOS, and final post-diaphragmatic breathing exercises (DBE) IOS. For the intervention, FET was requested with five low-volume followed by three high-volume huffs, and finally ten DBE repetitions. Coughing occurred randomly and was not previously requested. To investigate whether FET-induced coughing alters oscillometric parameters, the participants were divided into two groups: those who presented with cough (CG) during the protocol and those who did not (NCG). Forty-three children and adolescents with CF participated in the study (51.2% female), with an average age of 10.44±2.64 years, where forced expiratory value - FEV1=78.51±23.28%, and body mass index - BMI=17.18±2.24 kg/m2. The huffing sequence increased all oscillometric parameters, while DBE repetitions led to an increase in these parameters, without a complete return to baseline values. In terms of coughing, there was no significant difference between the NCG and CG in any of the parameters studied. It was observed that, during the FET, diaphragmatic breathing exercises can attenuate the effort exerted by the forced expiratory maneuver on the airways."

    "abstract": "<i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> is an opportunistic pathogen that uses several mechanisms to survive in the iron-limiting host environment. The innate immune protein calprotectin (CP) sequesters ferrous iron [Fe(II)], among other divalent transition metal ions, to limit its availability to pathogens. CP levels are increased in individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF), a hereditary disease that leads to chronic pulmonary infection by <i>P. aeruginosa</i>. We previously showed that aerobic CP treatment of <i>P. aeruginosa</i> induces a multi-metal starvation response that alters expression of several virulence properties. However, the CF lung is a hypoxic environment due to the growth of <i>P. aeruginosa</i> in dense biofilms. Here, we report that anaerobic CP treatment of <i>P. aeruginosa</i> induces many processes associated with an aerobic iron starvation response, including decreased phenazine production and increased expression of the PrrF small regulatory RNAs (sRNAs). However, the iron starvation response elicited by CP in anaerobic conditions shows characteristics that are distinct from responses observed in aerobic growth, including a lack of siderophore production and increased induction of genes for the FeoAB Fe(II) and Phu heme uptake systems. Also distinct from aerobic conditions, CP treatment induces expression of genes for predicted manganese transporters MntH1 and MntH2 during anaerobic growth while eliciting a less robust zinc starvation response compared to aerobic conditions. Induction of <i>mntH2</i> is dependent on the PrrF sRNAs, suggesting a novel example of metal regulatory cross-talk. Thus, anaerobic CP treatment results in a multi-metal starvation response with key distinctions from aerobic conditions, revealing differences in <i>P. aeruginosa</i> metal homeostasis during anaerobic growth.IMPORTANCEIron is critical for most microbial pathogens, and the innate immune system sequesters this metal to limit microbial growth. Pathogens must overcome iron sequestration to survive during infection. For many pathogens, iron homeostasis has primarily been studied in aerobic conditions. Nevertheless, some host environments are hypoxic, including chronic lung infection sites in individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF). Here, we use the innate immune protein calprotectin, which sequesters divalent metal ions including Fe(II), to study the anaerobic iron starvation response of a common CF lung pathogen, <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>. We report several distinctions of this response during anaerobiosis, highlighting the importance of carefully considering the host environment when investigating the role of nutritional immunity in host-pathogen interactions."

Multi-drug resistance is increasingly common in <i>S. aureus</i> infections, creating an urgent need for new antimicrobials or compounds that improve efficacy of currently available antibiotics. <i>S. aureus</i> biofilms, such as those found in the lungs of people with CF and in soft tissue infections, are notoriously recalcitrant to antimicrobial treatment due to the characteristic metabolic differences associated with a sessile mode of growth. In this work, we show that another CF pathogen, <i>Burkholderia cenocepacia</i>, produces one or more secreted compounds that can prevent <i>S. aureus</i> biofilm formation and inhibit existing <i>S. aureus</i> biofilms. The <i>B. cenocepacia</i>-mediated antagonistic activity is restricted to <i>S. aureus</i> species and perhaps some other staphylococci; however, this inhibition does not necessarily extend to other Gram-positive species.

This protocol describes a study which aims to assess the applicability of target trial emulation in CF. We aim to emulate an existing trial in CF and assess to what extent the results from the trial can be replicated using registry data. The target trial is a published randomised controlled trial which found evidence for beneficial effects of azithromycin use on lung function in young adults with CF. Two emulated trials are planned: one using data from the UK CF Registry and one using data from the US CF Registry. The inclusion and exclusion criteria, treatment and outcome definitions, follow-up period, and estimand of interest are all designed to match the published trial as closely as possible. The analysis step of the trial emulations will use causal inference methods to control for confounding.

    "abstract": "Nontuberculous mycobacterial pulmonary disease (NTMPD) is a chronic, often progressive condition associated with a significant symptom burden and increased mortality. Goals of NTMPD treatment include microbiological eradication, symptom reduction, improved quality of life (QoL), and preventing disease progression. Antibiotics are used to reduce microbial burden, and cultures of sputum are used to guide treatment. However, it is unclear whether achieving culture-negative status (often called \"culture conversion\") is associated with improved clinical outcomes. Studies use a variety of measures including symptom burden, radiological status, lung function, 6-min walk test distance, QoL assessments, and mortality to evaluate clinical outcomes related to changes in how patients feel, function, and survive. There is strong interest in more clearly understanding which clinical benefits may be associated with culture conversion. As NTMPD can cause sustained structural lung damage and declines in long-term pulmonary function, it is important to have clear evidence if prevention of these morbidities is associated with culture conversion. This targeted literature review summarizes the published evidence regarding associations between sputum culture conversion and clinical outcomes in patients with NTMPD. Identified studies used varying definitions of culture conversion and treatment success, making interpretation of outcomes across studies challenging. Although some studies suggest an association between culture conversion and aspects of clinical improvement, overall, there are currently few high-quality studies supporting a link. Further clarification of the relationship between culture conversion and clinical outcomes would be helpful in improving clinical monitoring and therapeutic decision-making during the treatment of patients with NTMPD."

CD4+ Th2 cells promote these diseases through secretion of IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13.

Loss of T cell CFTR expression increased Th2 cytokine production compared with control cells. Mice with CFTR-deficient T cells developed increased allergic airway disease to Alternaria alternata extract compared with control mice.

The CFTR potentiator ivacaftor reduced allergic inflammation and type 2 cytokine secretion in bronchoalveolar lavage of humanized CFTR mice following Alternaria alternata extract challenge and decreased Th2 development in human T cell culture. These data support a direct role of CFTR in regulating T cell sensitivity to IL-4 and demonstrate a potential CFTR-specific therapeutic strategy for Th2 cell-mediated allergic disease."

    "title": "Assessment of the efficacy of an antimicrobial peptide in the context of cystic fibrosis airways.",
    "abstract": "Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) offer a promising alternative to control airway infections with multi-resistant bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (MRSA), which commonly infects patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). However, the behavior of AMPs in the CF context has yet to be fully elucidated. CF airways produce large amounts of proteases and viscous mucus (sputum), which may affect the efficacy of AMPs. The present work aimed to determine whether CF conditions affect the bactericidal efficacy of CAMA, a promising AMP known to kill clinical MRSA strains efficiently. Using a killing assay, we quantified CAMA bactericidal activity on a CF clinical MRSA strain in the presence of several compounds of CF airways, including sputum and bronchial epithelial cells (BECs). Our results indicate that CF sputum impairs the bactericidal efficacy of CAMA. Similar results were observed when CAMA was incubated with an artificial sputum medium (ASM). When used separately, sputum components (DNA, lipids, and mucins) reproduced the inhibitory effects of ASM. Additionally, the bactericidal efficacy of CAMA was also slightly altered when planktonic <i>S. aureus</i> strains were co-cultured with CF BECs. However, CAMA was not active against <i>S. aureus</i> cultured on BEC in biofilm mode, characteristic of chronic infections in CF patients. These findings suggest that although CAMA represents a promising tool to treat MRSA strains, the CF environment may impair the efficacy of this AMP. Identifying strategies to protect AMPs from the deleterious effects of CF sputum is a key priority."

    "abstract": "Malabsorption is a complex and multifaceted condition characterised by the defective passage of nutrients into the blood and lymphatic streams. Several congenital or acquired disorders may cause either selective or global malabsorption in both children and adults, such as cystic fibrosis, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI), coeliac disease (CD) and other enteropathies, lactase deficiency, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), autoimmune atrophic gastritis, Crohn's disease, and gastric or small bowel resections. Early recognition of malabsorption is key for tailoring a proper diagnostic work-up for identifying the cause of malabsorption. A patient's medical and pharmacological history is essential for identifying risk factors. Several examinations such as endoscopy with small intestinal biopsies, non-invasive functional tests and radiological imaging are useful in diagnosing malabsorption. Because of its high prevalence, CD should always be looked for in cases of malabsorption with no other obvious explanations and in high-risk individuals. Nutritional support is key in the management of patients with malabsorption; different options are available, including oral supplements, enteral or parenteral nutrition. In patients with short bowel syndrome, teduglutide proved effective in reducing the need for parenteral nutrition, thus improving the quality of life of these patients. Primary care physicians play a central role in the early detection of malabsorption and should be involved in multidisciplinary teams for improving the overall management of these patients. In this European consensus, involving ten scientific societies and several experts, we have dissected all the issues around malabsorption, including the definitions and diagnostic testing (Part 1), high-risk categories and special populations, nutritional assessment and management, and primary care perspective (Part 2)."

    "abstract": "Hereditary bronchiectasis refers to a subset of bronchiectasis related to genetic mutations, presenting with common clinical features. Historically, diagnosing this condition has been difficult due to the inaccessibility of diagnostic services coupled with a lack of awareness of the syndrome. We hypothesize that whole exome sequencing (WES) in patients with supporting clinical features, combined with non-genetic testing methods, will enhance the diagnosis of hereditary bronchiectasis. In total, 87 patients with clinical features suggestive of hereditary bronchiectasis, such as diffuse bronchiectasis (≥ 2 lobes) combined with early onset symptoms, recurrent otitis media, rhinosinusitis, infertility, organ laterality defects or a family history of bronchiectasis, were included in this study. Among them, 49.4% (43/87) were diagnosed with hereditary bronchiectasis, including 15 patients with cystic fibrosis, 27 patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia, and 1 patient with immunodeficiency-21. The combined use of WES and non-genetic testing methods significantly improved the diagnostic rate of hereditary bronchiectasis compared to non-genetic testing alone (47.1% vs. 25.3%, P = 0.005). Re-analysis of negative commercial genetic tests led to two additional diagnoses, though this increase was not statistically significant (47.1% vs. 49.4%, P = 0.879). We have described the supporting clinical features of patients with hereditary bronchiectasis. Clinicians should recommend WES for patients exhibiting these characteristics, in combination with accessible non-genetic testing methods, to maximize diagnostic accuracy. For patients with negative initial genetic test results, re-analysis of WES data may facilitate obtaining a new diagnosis."

    "abstract": "Extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is a signaling molecule that acts as a paracrine and autocrine modulator of cell function. Here, we characterized the role of luminal ATP in the regulation of epithelial principal cells (PCs) in the epididymis, an understudied organ that plays crucial roles in male reproduction. We previously showed that ATP secretion by PCs is part of a complex communication system that ensures the establishment of an optimal luminal acidic environment in the epididymis. However, the molecular mechanisms regulating ATP release and the role of ATP-mediated signaling in PCs acidifying functions are not fully understood. In other cell types, pannexin 1 (PANX-1) has been associated with ATP-induced ATP release through the interaction with the purinergic P2X7 receptor. Here, we show that PANX-1 and P2X7 are located in the apical membrane of PCs in the mouse epididymis. Functional analysis using the immortalized epididymal PC cell line (DC2) and the mouse epididymis perfused in vivo showed that (1) PANX-1 and P2X7 participate in ATP release by DC2 cells, together with cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR); (2) several ATP-activated P2Y and P2X purinergic receptors are expressed in DC2 cells; (3) the nonhydrolyzable ATP analog ATPγS induces a dose-dependent increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration in DC2 cells, a process that is mainly mediated by P2X7; and (4) perfusion of the epididymal lumen in vivo with ATPγS induces the internalization of apical sodium-hydrogen exchanger 3 (NHE3) in PCs. Altogether, this study shows that luminal ATP, regulated by CFTR, PANX-1, and P2X7, modulates sodium-proton exchange in PCs in an autocrine manner through activation of purinergic receptor-mediated intracellular calcium signaling."

    "abstract": "Nanosized extracellular vesicles (EVs) are released by all cells to convey cell-to-cell communication. EVs, including exosomes and microvesicles, carry an array of bioactive molecules, such as proteins and RNAs, encapsulated by a membrane lipid bilayer. Epithelial cells, endothelial cells, and various immune cells in the lung contribute to the pool of EVs in the lung microenvironment and carry molecules reflecting their cellular origin. EVs can maintain lung health by regulating immune responses, inducing tissue repair, and maintaining lung homeostasis. They can be detected in lung tissues and biofluids such as bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and blood, offering information about disease processes, and can function as disease biomarkers. Here, we discuss the role of EVs in lung homeostasis and pulmonary diseases such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis, pulmonary fibrosis, and lung injury. The mechanistic involvement of EVs in pathogenesis and their potential as disease biomarkers are discussed. Finally, the pulmonary field benefits from EVs as clinical therapeutics in severe pulmonary inflammatory disease, as EVs from mesenchymal stem cells attenuate severe respiratory inflammation in multiple clinical trials. Further, EVs can be engineered to carry therapeutic molecules for enhanced and broadened therapeutic opportunities, such as the anti-inflammatory molecule CD24. Finally, we discuss the emerging opportunity of using different types of EVs for treating severe respiratory conditions."

Population pharmacokinetic (PopPk) models attempt to parameterize the behavior of plasma concentrations in different target populations and scenarios such as renal replacement therapy, to successful therapeutic outcome and avoid these side effects. A scoping review was conducted following the guidelines of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR), through a search in PubMed, LILACS, OVID Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, SAGE Journals, Google Scholar and previous known registers of PopPk models in non-critically ill adult patients, published between 1998 and 2024. A total of 190 papers were fully screened, of which were included 36 studies conducted in different populations; 12 in general population, 23 in special populations (surgical, with impaired renal function, obese, elderly, with cancer and cystic fibrosis), and 1 in mixed population (general and with cancer). The main parameters in the models were renal clearance and volume of distribution. The principal covariables that affected the models were creatinine clearance and weight. All studies used internal evaluation and 4 of them used an external group. The technology for the development and implementation of PopPk models requires experts in clinical pharmacology and is limited to university and research centers. The software is mostly expensive and, in most cases, the pharmacokinetic models and the heterogeneity in the parameters and evaluation methods depend on which compartmental model, parameters, covariates and software have been used. These models require validation in the clinical context and conducting experiments to adapt them for precision dosing in different subpopulations."

    "abstract": "<i>Mycobacterium abscessus</i> is a pathogen recently associated with patients with chronic lung conditions such as bronchiectasis and cystic fibrosis. <i>M. abscessus</i> is an environmental bacterium but recent evidence suggests that the pathogen is also transmitted from host-to-host. Because <i>M. abscessus</i> is known to form biofilms on the respiratory mucosa the release of bacteria from the biofilm becomes an important aspect on the transmission of the infection. A biofilm releasing system was established. A transposon library of <i>M. abscessus</i> was then screened to identify genes associated with the release from biofilms. Several enzymes and genes of unidentified function were linked with the ability to detach from the biofilm. It was also shown that detached bacteria were increased capable of establish a new biofilm, attach to epithelial cells, and infect macrophages. To determine the surface molecules linked with the ability to infect new hosts, a surface proteomic was performed, showing that detaching bacteria express many proteins do not present in biofilm bacteria. Detached <i>M. abscessus</i>, one of the possible infectious phenotypes, contains specific proteins and lipids in the surface that facilitate the infection of new hosts. In addition, we identified many small proteins that have the likelihood to be associated with the release of the biofilm bacteria."

This study aimed to describe the use of ICS in patients with bronchiectasis across Europe. Patients with bronchiectasis were enrolled into the European Bronchiectasis Registry from 2015 to 2022. Patients were grouped into ICS users and non-users at baseline and clinical characteristics associated with ICS use were investigated. Patients were followed up for clinical outcomes of exacerbation, hospitalisation and mortality for up to 5 years. We evaluated if elevated blood eosinophil counts (above the laboratory upper limit of normal) modified the effect of ICS on exacerbations. 19 324 patients were included for analysis and 10 109 (52.3%) were recorded as being prescribed ICS at baseline. After exclusion of patients with a history of asthma, COPD and/or ABPA, 3174/9715 (32.7%) patients with bronchiectasis were prescribed ICS. Frequency of ICS use varied across countries, ranging from 17% to 85% of included patients. ICS users had more severe disease, with significantly worse lung function, higher Bronchiectasis Severity Index scores and more frequent exacerbations at baseline (p<0.0001). Overall, ICS users did not have a reduced risk of exacerbation or hospitalisation during follow-up, but a significant reduction in exacerbation frequency was observed in the subgroup of ICS users with elevated blood eosinophil counts (relative risk 0.70, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.84, p<0.001). ICS use is common in bronchiectasis, including in those not currently recommended ICS according to bronchiectasis guidelines. ICS use may be associated with reduced exacerbation frequency in patients with elevated blood eosinophils."

The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the impact that ETI has had on body composition in people with CF. A systematic review was performed using MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Quality assessment using the Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tools were performed. Results were summarised narratively. Five observational cohort studies involving a total of 185 participants were reviewed. Three studies showed an increase in fat mass (7.0-8.6 kg, 13.2-14.3 kg, and 13.4-15.5 kg). Two studies reported an increase in fat-free mass (49.4-50.1 kg, 52.5-55 kg), while one reported a decrease (50.5-48.9 kg). Two studies found an increase in fat mass index (4.1-6.3 kgm/<sup>2</sup> and 4.7-5.4 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and fat-free mass index (17.4-17.7 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and 18.1-18.8 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). Two studies observed an increase in percentage body fat mass (12.1-15.4% and 23.1-27.6%). Four studies were classified as low quality, while one was considered medium quality. This review suggest that commencing ETI results in changes in body composition. Firm conclusions about the type and distribution of change in body composition cannot be made due to limited studies, high heterogeneity, and methodical weaknesses. It highlights the necessity for higher quality and longer-term studies to explore the impact that ETI is having on body composition."

Area under the curve (AUC), average concentrations (C<sub>avg</sub>), minimum and maximum concentrations, clearance, and other parameters were determined. Twelve transplant and fourteen non-transplant participants with CF completed the study.

This investigation aimed to test the possibility of a combination of Torulaspora delbrueckii as a probiotic with ciprofloxacin in an animal model having pulmonary fibrosis with a moderate load of Klebsiella pneumonia. Ninety adult male rats were split into six groups (15 rats/each): GI (control), GII (lung fibrosis), GIII (lung fibrosis infected by K. pneumonia), GIV (lung fibrosis infected by K. pneumonia then treated with ciprofloxacin), GV (lung fibrosis infected by K. pneumonia and fed with T. delbrueckii) and GVI (lung fibrosis infected by K. pneumonia then treated with combined therapy of ciprofloxacin and T. delbrueckii) for 28 days. Survival rate and bacterial load were determined in various experimental animal groups. Histological variations were examined as well as scanning electron microscopy. Gene expression, various levels of cytokines, redox enzymes, and oxidative stress markers were assessed and compared in different tested groups. The treatment using a combination of T. delbrueckii and ciprofloxacin is suggested as a new method to treat induced lung fibrosis in animals and infected with K. pneumonia as a possible option in complicated infection."

Adipose tissue is recognized as an important niche that supports M. tuberculosis persistence. However, the dormancy, latency, and persistence mechanisms of M. abscessus in the host remain poorly understood. This study investigated how adipose tissue serves as a niche for M. abscessus using both a human adipose tissue ex vivo infection model and a murine adipose tissue in vivo infection model. M. abscessus infected not only the cytosol of adipocytes but also entered host lipid droplets, where it formed intracytoplasmic lipid inclusions in the bacterial cell. To our knowledge, this unique localization has never been reported for M. abscessus or any other mycobacterium. Within host lipid droplets, M. abscessus lost acid-fastness and gained Nile Red positivity. These results suggest that M. abscessus acquires a dormancy-like phenotype within host lipid droplets of adipocytes, potentially contributing to its persistence, virulence, and resistance to treatment. These findings provide valuable insights into mycobacterial persistence mechanisms and could offer a promising foundation for developing novel therapeutic approaches."

Following multidisciplinary discussion and shared decision-making involving the parents, ETI was initiated at 27 weeks of gestation. At 38+4 weeks, the infant was delivered. Despite the treatment, the newborn developed meconium ileus, necessitating emergency surgery after birth. We explore potential factors contributing to the lack of success in our case compared to previously reported successful cases in USA and Spain. Drug levels measured in neonatal blood and in maternal breast milk indicated minimal drug exposure, raising questions about whether variability in placental transfer and excretion in breast milk or suboptimal ETI dosing in the overweight mother impacted the outcome. Additionally, the natural variability in meconium ileus outcome, which can range from spontaneous resolution to severe complications must be considered. In our case, ETI may have mitigated the severity of the condition, preventing serious complications like bowel perforation or peritonitis. However, given that about 20 % of all fetal bowel dilation resolves spontaneously, it remains uncertain whether the positive outcomes in prior cases were attributable to ETI or the natural course of the disease. We emphasize the need for more evidence on in utero ETI exposure by advocating for the collection of cases involving ETI treatment for fetal meconium ileus, regardless of outcomes. Developing guidelines will be essential to optimize benefits for both mother and fetus while minimizing risks."

CFTR modulators, particularly the elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI) combination, improve lung function in children older than 6 years in real-life studies. This study aimed to assess the impact of ETI on aerobic capacity in children with CF aged 6-11 years under real-life conditions and to evaluate whether prior CFTR modulator treatment affects these outcomes. A multicenter, prospective cohort study was conducted with pediatric CF patients. Participants underwent evaluations 6-8 months before ETI (T1), at the start of ETI (T2), and 6-8 months post-treatment (T3). Primary outcomes included cardiorespiratory fitness assessed via peak oxygen consumption (VO<sub>2</sub>peak) during a cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET), and secondary outcomes encompassed lung function, quality of life, physical activity, and functional mobility. Of the 28 patients (mean age 9.02±1.59 years), 19 were ETI-naive, and 9 had prior CFTR modulator treatment. Significant improvements were observed in FEV<sub>1</sub> (p<0.001), and several functional mobility tests (30CST, Stair Climb Test, 10MWT). However, VO<sub>2</sub>peak showed no significant changes between T1 and T3. Quality of life scores improved notably in emotional, eating, and respiratory domains, and a slight improvement was noted in physical activity levels (p=0.037). ETI treatment significantly enhances lung function and certain aspects of quality of life and physical fitness in pediatric CF patients. However, it does not significantly alter aerobic capacity (VO<sub>2</sub>peak) within the observed period."

Research into the health risks of CF carriers has been limited by a lack of large cohorts tested for CF carrier status, but routine clinical testing identifies CF carriers in the population. Such test records additionally contain large amounts of clinical information, making them a valuable research resource to not only identify CF carriers in the population but also to provide additional data not found elsewhere. Following governance approvals, we adapted 30 years worth of CF genetic testing records generated by the All-Wales Medical Genomics Service (AWMGS) and submitted them to the SAIL Databank for anonymised linkage. Unexpected obstacles meant that a minimum amount of clinical information could be annotated ahead of linkage. The raw data were highly heterogeneous due to the records' longitudinal collection and clinical origins, making standardisation difficult. Moreover, the presence of unique identifiers in the clinical data violated the separation principle, requiring manual annotation to produce a cleaned dataset. Explicit identification of patients or their relatives throughout the records complicated split file anonymisation. Extracting useful information from historical clinical genetic test records is a significant challenge with technical and governance aspects. The mixing of unique identifiers with clinical data in heterogeneous, unstructured free text combined with a lack of automated tools meant that manual annotation was required to adhere to the separation principle. As such, only a minimum of the available clinical data was annotatable within the project timeline and mutually exclusive access to the identifiable and pseudonymised data meant that annotations could not later be validated. Future efforts to link clinical genetic test records for research must consider these challenges in their approach."

We leveraged a prospective collection of P. aeruginosa isolates from pwCF attending the Southern Alberta Adult CF clinic from 1986 to 2020 to identify all individuals with LES infection. LES isolates collected every 1-2 years from each pwCF were sequenced and compared with 171 published LES genomes by phylogenetic analysis. Of 395 pwCF screened, ten pwCF infected with the LES were identified, from whom 46 LES isolates were sequenced. The earliest LES isolate was recovered in 1986, ∼2 years earlier than the previously oldest published LES isolate recovered in the UK. Phylogenetic analysis identified a diverse set of isolates at the root of the LES phylogeny that formed four clades, one of which gave rise to a \"classic LES\" clade. Canadian isolates formed a paraphyletic group that included the root of this clade and out of which the UK LES clade emerged. We estimated the date of the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of the UK LES clade as 1977. Our study provides genomic evidence in support of a silent epidemic of LES infection occurring in the late 1970s among pwCF first originating in Canada and being spread to the UK, where transmission markedly accelerated."

    "abstract": "CFTR modulator therapy has unprecedented positive effects on people with CF (pwCF). However, immunogenic reactions to CFTR modulator therapy may lead to drug discontinuation. We aimed to identify pwCF, intolerant to CFTR modulator therapy due to suspected immunogenic adverse events (iAE). This survey assessed the types of reaction (e.g. rash, liver injury, drug fever) including reactions after re-exposure and was completed by ECFS CTN Centers. Response rate to the survey was 74 %. 89 CF centers treating approximately 12000 to 17500 pwCF in 28 countries participated and 75 (84 %) CF centers reported discontinuation of CFTR modulator therapy. 37 (41.1 %) of CF centers reported iAE affecting 200 (1.1 - 1.7 %) pwCF. Detailed information about iAEs was provided for 41 of 200 (20.5 % of affected) pwCF. Of the iAEs reported in detail 33/41 (80.5 %) were associated with elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor modulator therapy, 6 (14.6 %) with lumacaftor/ivacaftor and 2 (4.9 %) with tezacaftor/ivacaftor. 72 % of pwCF with iAE were re-exposed to CFTR modulator therapy. 32 % of re-exposed pwCF reported a second iAE. Rash and elevated liver enzymes were most frequently reported iAEs. iAE were mostly transient. Drug allergy to CFTR modulator therapy was rare, but highly relevant for individual pwCF."

Cross-sectional retrospective cohort study of individuals with CF under 18 years old treated in a referral center between 2007 and 2023. Data was derived from medical records. A descriptive analysis of the variables at diagnosis, including pathogenic genetic variants in the CFTR gene, clinical findings, and demographic data. The population of 110 patients was predominantly male (54.5%) and white (66.4%). Age at diagnosis ranged from 13 days to 17 years (median = 2 months), 78.2% were diagnosed at < 2 years, and 50.9% were diagnosed following neonatal screening. The most frequent clinical manifestations at diagnosis were steatorrhea (70.0%), persistent respiratory symptoms (58.2%), and malnutrition (36.4%). The most common CFTR variants were F508del (49.0%), G542X (7.3%), and 3120+1G>A (5.9%). Eighty-four (76.4%) were eligible to use at least 1 of the 4 CFTR modulator therapies available in Brazil, and 29 were eligible for 3 therapies because they are homozygous for F508del. Identification of CFTR variants at diagnosis can provide many benefits to patients, such as early interventions and CFTR modulator therapy, and is feasible in Brazil. Because each country may have different distributions of CFTR variants, it is essential to evaluate these distributions as we advance methodologies for gene variant detection, particularly in the contexts of newborn screening and diagnostic testing."

    "abstract": "<i>Burkholderia cenocepacia</i> is an opportunistic pathogen that has been associated with nosocomial outbreaks in hospitals and can cause severe respiratory infections among immunocompromised patients and individuals suffering from cystic fibrosis. The transmissibility and intrinsic antibiotic resistance of <i>B. cenocepacia</i> pose a significant challenge in healthcare settings. In this study, with the aim to identify novel drug targets to fight <i>B. cenocepacia</i> infections, we employed a genome-wide transposon sequencing (Tn-seq) approach to unravel fitness determinants required for survival in <i>Galleria mellonella</i> (<i>in vivo</i> infection model) and pig lung tissue (<i>ex vivo</i> organ model). A total of 698 and 117 fitness genes were identified for each of the models, respectively, and 62 genes were found to be important for both. To confirm our results, we constructed individual mutants in selected genes and validated their fitness in the two models. Among the various determinants identified was a rare genomic island (<i>I35_RS03700-I35_RS03770</i>) involved in O-antigen and lipopolysaccharide synthesis. We demonstrate that this gene cluster is required for virulence in the <i>G. mellonella</i> infection model but, by contrast, counteracts efficient colonization of pig lung tissue. Our results highlight the power of the Tn-seq approach to unravel fitness determinants that could be used as therapeutic targets in the future and show that the choice of the infection model for mutant selection is paramount. The opportunistic pathogen <i>Burkholderia cenocepacia</i> has been associated with nosocomial infections in healthcare facilities, where it can cause outbreaks involving infections of the bloodstream, respiratory tract, and urinary tract as well as severe complications in immunocompromised patients. With the aim to identify novel targets to fight <i>B. cenocepacia</i> infections, we have used a genome-wide approach to unravel fitness genes required for host colonization in a clinical strain, <i>B. cenocepacia</i> H111. Among the various determinants that we identified is a rare genomic island that modifies the bacterial lipopolysaccharide. Our results highlight the power of the transposon sequencing approach to identify new targets for infection treatment and show the importance of using different infection models."

    "abstract": "Phages, including the viruses that lyse bacterial pathogens, offer unique therapeutic advantages, including their capacity to lyse antibiotic-resistant bacteria and disrupt biofilms without harming the host microbiota. The lack of new effective antibiotics and the growing limitations of existing antibiotics have refocused attention on phage therapy as an option in complex clinical cases such as burn wounds, cystic fibrosis, and pneumonia. This review describes clinical cases and preclinical studies in which phage therapy has been effective in both human and veterinary medicine, and in an agricultural context. In addition, critical challenges, such as the narrow host range of bacteriophages, the possibility of bacterial resistance, and regulatory constraints on the widespread use of phage therapy, are addressed. Future directions include optimizing phage therapy through strategies ranging from phage cocktails to broadening phage host range through genetic modification, and using phages as vaccines or biocontrol agents. In the future, if phage can be efficiently delivered, maintained in a stable state, and phage-antibiotic synergy can be achieved, phage therapy will offer much needed treatment options. However, the successful implementation of phage therapy within the current standards of practice will also require the considerable development of regulatory infrastructure and greater public acceptance. In closing, this review highlights the promise of phage therapy as a critical backup or substitute for antibiotics. It proposes a new role as a significant adjunct to, or even replacement for, antibiotics in treating multidrug-resistant bacterial infections."

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the airway epithelial response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection severity in patients with chronic respiratory diseases remain unelucidated. Using an <i>in vitro</i> model of differentiated primary bronchial epithelial cells, we aimed to investigate the molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection in pre-existing cystic fibrosis (CF) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Our study revealed reduced susceptibility of CF and COPD airway epithelia to SARS-CoV-2, relative to that in healthy controls. Mechanistically, reduced transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) activity potentially contributed to this resistance of CF epithelium. Upregulated complement and inflammatory pathways in CF and COPD epithelia potentially primed the antiviral state prior to infection. Analysis of a COVID-19 patient cohort validated our findings, correlating specific inflammatory markers (IP-10, SERPINA1, and CFB) with COVID-19 severity. This study elucidates SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and identifies potential biomarkers for clinical monitoring."

One of them is the Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised 14+ (CFQ-R 14+). Its measurement properties have not been comprehensively assessed in the population of Polish adults. The aim of the study is to verify the construct validity, including structural and criterion validity, as well as internal consistency, of the Polish version of the CFQ-R 14+ in the population of adults with cystic fibrosis. We conducted a cross-sectional survey among adults with cystic fibrosis. After preparing the database, we performed a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) followed by exploratory factor analysis (EFA) using the parallel analysis method principal axis factoring with Oblimin rotation. Intercorrelations of questionnaire factors and the occurrence of relationships among items for the general scale results was checked. We also presented basic descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis, minimum and maximum values). The analyses included responses from 220 adult patients. CFA results did not show adequate goodness of fit (χ<sup>2</sup>(1025) = 2112.35, p < 0.001; CFI = 0.831; TLI = 0.814; RMSEA = 0.069; SRMR = 0.074). After EFA, 6 factors were extracted, considering 40 out of 50 questions of the CFQ-R 14+. CFQ-R 14+ may be useful in assessing the quality of life of Polish adult patients with cystic fibrosis. Our analysis demonstrates that the optimal factor structure of the tool in this population includes 6 scales."

Data from randomized controlled or randomized active comparator trials were included in this network meta-analysis which used frequentist approach for comparing the efficacy of drugs and ranking based on P-scores. Outcomes of interest were mean differences in percentage-predicted forced expiratory volume in one second (ppFEV<sub>1</sub>), CF questionnaire-revised respiratory domain (CFQ-R) scores, sweat chloride (SwCl) levels, and odds ratios (OR) for serious adverse events (SAE). Data from 13 studies were analyzed. Compared to placebo, the effects of VTD and ETI on ppFEV1 were almost quadruple of Tez-Iva and Lum-Iva (VTD: 12.78 [95% confidence intervals: 6.41; 19.15] and ETI: 11.95 [7.40; 16.50]) and almost seven times of Tez-Iva and Lum-Iva for CFQ-R (VTD: 21.23 [- 28.72; 71.18] and ETI: 19.27 [10.56; 27.98]). A statistically significant difference was noted between VTD and ETI in SwCl reduction (mean difference: - 8.59 [- 15.53; - 1.65]). There were no statistically significant ORs for SAEs for any CFTR modulators but VTD, ETI, and Tez-Iva were least associated with SAEs (ORs were 0.15 [0.01; 1.79], 0.49 [0.31; 0.78], and 0.74 [0.50; 1.09], respectively, as compared to placebo). Overall, P-score ranking ranked VTD as first and ETI as second, followed by others. VTD and ETI were more efficacious than Tez-Iva and Lum-Iva in pwCF with at least one F508del-CFTR-allele."

An overview of systematic reviews with meta-analyses. Results were pooled using forest plots and certainty of evidence evaluated with GRADE. Medline, Embase, Scopus, CINAHL and SPORTDiscus were searched from January 2002 to March 2024. Systematic reviews with meta-analyses exploring CRF and health in children and adolescents aged <18 years. From the 9062 records identified, 14 reviews were included. Meta-analysed data from 125 164 observations covering 33 health outcomes were compiled, showing favourable (n=26) or null (n=7) associations with CRF. Among general populations, the associations were weak-to-moderate, with favourable links between CRF and indicators of anthropometry and adiposity, cardiometabolic and vascular health, and mental health and well-being. Among clinical populations, CRF was lower in participants with a condition compared with healthy controls, with the largest difference for newly diagnosed cancer (mean difference=-19.6 mL/kg/min; 95%CI: -21.4,-17.8). Patients with cystic fibrosis had a greater risk for all-cause mortality when comparing low CRF vs. high (relative risk=4.9; 95%CI: 1.1, 22.1). The certainty of evidence ranged from very low to moderate. CRF shows promising links to numerous health outcomes in paediatric populations, though the low certainty of evidence calls for further research. High-quality longitudinal evidence is warranted to confirm the findings and investigate a predictive role of childhood CRF for future health."

    "abstract": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a rare disease caused by mutations in the gene encoding the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a chloride channel with an important role in the airways. Despite the clinical efficacy of present modulators in restoring the activity of defective CFTR, there are patients who show persistent pulmonary infections, mainly due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Recently, we reported an unprecedented property of antimicrobial peptides i.e. Esc peptides, which consists in their ability to act as potentiators of CFTR carrying the most common mutation (the loss of phenylalanine 508) affecting protein folding, trafficking and gating. In this work, by electrophysiology experiments and computational studies, the capability of these peptides and de-novo designed analogs was demonstrated to recover the function of other mutated forms of CFTR which severely affect the channel gating (G551D and G1349D). This is presumably due to direct interaction of the peptides with the nucleotide binding domains (NBDs) of CFTR, followed by a novel local phenomenon consisting in distancing residues located at the cytosolic side of the NBDs interface, thus stabilizing the open conformation of the pore at its cytosolic end. The most promising peptides for the dual antimicrobial and CFTR potentiator activities were also shown to display antipseudomonal activity in conditions mimicking the CF pulmonary ion transport and mucus obstruction, with a higher efficacy than the clinically used colistin. These studies should assist in development of novel drugs for lung pathology in CF, with dual CFTR potentiator and large spectrum antibiotic activities."

    "abstract": "Bacterial biofilms present significant therapeutic challenges due to their resistance to conventional antimicrobial treatment. Mucins typically serve as a protective barrier against pathogens, yet certain bacteria, such as <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> (<i>P. aeruginosa</i>), can exploit these glycoproteins as attachment sites for biofilm formation. This study introduces boronic acid-functionalized polyethyleneimine (PEI-BA) as a promising antibiofilm agent that effectively blocks bacterial adhesion to mucin-rich surfaces. Through the multivalent presentation of boronic acid groups, PEI-BA reversibly forms boronate ester bonds with mucin glycans, creating a protective barrier. Our findings show that PEI-BA prevents bacterial attachment through a nonbactericidal mechanism, potentially reducing the risk of resistance development. Notably, PEI-BA synergizes with a conventional antibiotic, tobramycin, significantly enhancing biofilm inhibition compared to either treatment alone. Systematic evaluation of PEI-BA formulations identified optimal functionalization levels, balancing glycan-binding capability with solubility. From a biomaterials design perspective, we demonstrate how rational polymer modification can transform a potent but cytotoxic antimicrobial agent (i.e., PEI) into a safe and effective antibiofilm material, opening further possibilities for managing biofilm-associated infections in clinical settings. This work establishes boronic acid-based nanomaterials as promising candidates for biofilm prevention and antibiotic enhancement, particularly in conditions like cystic fibrosis, where mucin-bacterial interactions contribute to disease progression."

    "abstract": "The active transport and retention principle is an alternative mechanism to the enhanced permeability and retention effect for explaining nanoparticle tumour delivery. It postulates that nanoparticles actively transport across tumour endothelial cells instead of passively moving through gaps between these cells. How nanoparticles transport across tumour endothelial cells remains unknown. Here we show that nanoparticles cross tumour endothelial cells predominantly using the non-receptor-based macropinocytosis pathway. We discovered that tumour endothelial cell membrane ruffles capture circulating nanoparticles, internalize them in intracellular vesicles and release them into the tumour interstitium. Tumour endothelial cells have a higher membrane ruffle density than healthy endothelium, which may partially explain the elevated nanoparticle tumour accumulation. Receptor-based endocytosis pathways such as clathrin-mediated endocytosis contribute to nanoparticle transport to a lesser extent. Nanoparticle size determines the degree of contribution for each pathway. Elucidating the nanoparticle transport mechanism is crucial for developing strategies to control nanoparticle tumour delivery."

    "abstract": "Cigarette smoke (CS) is a leading cause of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Here, we investigated whether the ion channel amplifier nesolicaftor rescues CS-induced mucociliary and ion channel dysfunction. As CS increases the expression of transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-β1), human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) from healthy donors were used for TGF-β1 and COPD donors (COPD-HBEC) for CS exposure experiments. CS and TGF-β1 induce mucociliary dysfunction by increasing MUC5AC and decreasing ion channel conductance important for mucus hydration. These include cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and apical large-conductance, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> (BK) channels. Nesolicaftor rescued CFTR and BK channel dysfunction, restored ciliary beat frequency (CBF), and decreased mucus viscosity and MUC5AC expression in CS-exposed COPD-HBEC. Nesolicaftor further reversed reductions in airway surface liquid (ASL) volumes, CBF, and CFTR and BK conductance, and blocked the increase in extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling in TGF-β1-exposed normal HBECs. Mechanistically, nesolicaftor increased, as expected, not only binding of PCBP1 to <i>CFTR</i> mRNA but also surprisingly to <i>LRRC26</i> mRNA, which encodes the gamma subunit required for BK function. Similar to nesolicaftor, the angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) losartan rescued TGF-β1-mediated decreases in PCBP1 binding to <i>LRRC26</i> mRNA. In addition, the ARB telmisartan restored PCBP1 binding to <i>CFTR</i> and <i>LRRC26</i> mRNAs to rescue CFTR and BK function in CS-exposed COPD-HBEC. Thus, nesolicaftor and ARBs act on the same target and were therefore neither additive nor synergistic in their actions. These data demonstrate that nesolicaftor and ARBs may provide benefits in COPD by improving ion channel function important for mucus hydration.<b>NEW & NOTEWORTHY</b> Cigarette smoke (CS) increases transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-β1) expression that causes mucociliary dysfunction by decreasing ion channel function. In our study, a CFTR amplifier (nesolicaftor) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (losartan and telmisartan) improve CS-induced ion channel dysfunction, by increasing binding of PCBP1 to <i>CFTR</i> and <i>LRRC26</i> mRNAs. Therefore, nesolicaftor and ARBs, acting on the same target, may provide therapeutic benefits for treating smoking-related diseases."

Significant advances in treatment for CF lung disease, including the expanded use of high-efficiency modulator therapies (HEMT) such as Trikafta, have dramatically increased both quality of life and life expectancy for people with CF (PwCF). With these advances, long-term extrapulmonary manifestations are more frequently recognized. Pseudo-Barter syndrome, acute kidney injury (AKI) induced by medications or dehydration, amyloidosis, nephrolithiasis, and IgA and diabetic nephropathies have been previously reported in PwCF. Newer data suggest that chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a new morbidity in the aging CF population, affecting 19% of people over age 55. CKD carries a high risk of premature death from cardiovascular complications. Studies suggest that CFTR dysfunction increases kidneys' vulnerability to injury caused by the downstream effects of CF. Improving the mutant CFTR function by HEMT may help to tease apart the kidney responses resulting from extrinsic factors and those intrinsically related to the CFTR gene mutations. Additionally, given the novelty of HEMT approaches, the potential off-target effects of their long-term use are currently unknown. We review the evolving kidney complications in PwCF and propose the term CF-related kidney disease. We hope this review will increase awareness about the changing phenotype of kidney dysfunction in PwCF and help prevent morbidity related to this condition."

There was no significant association between the intervention and any measured neonatal outcomes. In this quality improvement study, removal of isolated cannabis use and limited prenatal care as UDS indications, coupled with clinical decision support, was associated with improved racial equity in UDS testing and CPS reporting. The intervention was not associated with a significant change in UDS positivity for nonprescribed, noncannabis substances. These findings suggest that this intervention improved equity in UDS practices without decreasing identification of clinically relevant substance use."

Transcriptional profiling and metabolomics analysis of secondary metabolites produced by one of these mutants, Δ<i>gpaB</i> (<i>gpaB</i> encodes a Gα protein), showed GpaB controls the production of several important metabolites for the dual biofilm interaction, including pyripyropene A, a potent inhibitor of mammalian acyl-CoA cholesterol acyltransferase.

    "abstract": "Sweat parameters such as volume and chloride concentration may offer invaluable clinical insights for people with CF (PwCF). Pilocarpine-induced sweat collection for chloridometry measurement is the gold-standard for sweat chloride, but this technique is cumbersome and not suitable for remote settings. We have previously reported the utility of a skin-interfaced microfluidic device (CF Patch) in conjunction with a smartphone image processing platform that enables real-time measurement of sweating rates and sodium chloride loss in laboratory and remote settings. Here we conducted clinical studies characterizing the accuracy of the CF Patch compared to pilocarpine-induced sweat measurements using chloridometry and tested the feasibility of exercise-induced sweat chloride measurements in PwCF. The CF Patch demonstrated strong correlations compared to sweat chloride measured by chloridometry across clinic and remote settings and detected greater day-to-day sweat chloride variability in PwCF on CFTR modulators than healthy volunteers. These findings demonstrate that the CF Patch is suitable as a remote management device capable of measuring chloride concentrations and offers the potential of monitoring the efficacy of CF medication regimens."

    "title": "The Validity and Reliability of the Turkish Version of the AWESCORE Test.",
    "abstract": "Objective: Patient-reported quality of life (QoL) measurement is crucial in making clinical decisions in unison with the patients. The current gold standard for cystic fibrosis (CF) is the Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R), which has different applications for different age groups and requires a computer program to be evaluated. There is a need for a straightforward way to evaluate QoL in both pediatric and adult patients with CF. The study aims to establish the validity and reliability of the Turkish version of the Alfred Wellness Score (AWESCORE) test that has been developed to evaluate QoL in patients with CF. Materials and Methods: This study is a methodological study. The AWESCORE form was translated into Turkish and was applied to patients above 10 years of age. It includes 10 questions. Each question was scored using a numerical rating scale of 0-10. Total scores ranged from 0 to 100. Test-retest reliability was assessed over 24 hours. To determine validity, comparisons were sought between stable subjects and those in pulmonary exacerbation, and between AWESCORE and CFQ-R. Results: A total of 99 patients were included, 29 of whom were during their acute exacerbation period (29%). All questions showed intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) values above 0.9, indicating excellent reliability. Scores were higher during clinical stability compared to pulmonary exacerbation (mean ± SD): 79.35 ± 6.51 versus 41.93 ± 8.58 (P < .001). All questions were significantly worse in the acute exacerbation period, showing excellent validity with P values below .001 for each question. Conclusion: The Turkish version of the AWESCORE is valid and reliable in its ability to evaluate QoL in patients with CF."

    "abstract": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a monogenic autosomal recessive disorder that primarily affects the respiratory and gastrointestinal systems. It results from variants in the CFTR gene, leading to dysfunctional chloride channels, thickened mucus secretion, and subsequent multisystem complications. Significant advances have been made in CF treatment, particularly with the development of CFTR modulators, which are unique to genotypes and have improved clinical outcomes in many people with CF. However, the benefits of these therapies are not universal, with a considerable portion of the CF population-especially those with rare mutations-still without access to effective treatment options. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the pathophysiology and genetic basis of CF, explores current and emerging treatments, and discusses the ongoing challenges in the field."

The relationship between sputum bacterial load and the severity of pulmonary exacerbations remains unclear. This study aimed to explore the relationship between sputum bacterial load and clinical response to antibiotic treatment of pulmonary exacerbations in children with CF. Multicentre prospective longitudinal study of children with CF receiving IV tobramycin for a pulmonary exacerbation who had prior isolation of Gram-negative bacteria and able to expectorate sputum. Lung function (FEV<sub>1</sub>) and sputum bacterial load were assessed. Bacterial load was performed using quantitative PCR on either intact (live) bacterial cells or all bacterial DNA (live + dead) and targeted either P. aeruginosa only or all bacteria. Twelve children (14 admissions) were enrolled and each provided ≥2 sputum samples; 11 children (13 admissions) also had ≥2 FEV<sub>1</sub> measurements. In 10 admissions where FEV<sub>1</sub> improved, five showed a reduction in all live bacteria, with a median reduction by 8.65 × 10<sup>6</sup> copies/g (73 % reduction). Live P. aeruginosa was detected in 8/10 children and in seven, a median reduction of 2.99 × 10<sup>7</sup> copies/g (90 % reduction) was observed. Improved FEV<sub>1</sub> correlated with greater reductions in live + dead P. aeruginosa (ρ = -0.63, p = 0.04). A greater reduction in total sputum P. aeruginosa bacterial load (live + dead) was associated with improved lung function (FEV<sub>1</sub>) in children with CF receiving tobramycin."

However, the effect of this therapy on glycemic control in people with cystic fibrosis related diabetes (CFRD) is unclear. This study aimed to examine real-world effects of ETI on glycemia as captured by hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) in people with pre-existing CFRD. Retrospective chart review was performed at 4 US CF centers. Individuals with CFRD included in the study started ETI before December 2020, and had an HbA1c within 1 year before and up to 2 years after ETI initiation. A sub-analysis comparing CGM data and insulin dosing within the year before and after ETI was performed. Summary statistics were calculated and within-subject results compared. A total 175 individuals with CFRD had HbA1c data before and after ETI. Mean (±SD) age was 32.4 (±12.4) years, 49.1 % female. HbA1c were compared a median (IQR) of -40 (-93, 0) days before and 290 (107, 441) days after ETI initiation. Median (IQR) HbA1c decreased from 6.4 % (5.8, 7.2) to 6.0 % (5.5, 6.8), p<0.001. A subgroup of 13 individuals had CGM and basal insulin data for comparison. No changes were observed in CGM metrics, however, basal insulin dose in these patients decreased (p=0.03). Findings suggest clinical improvements in glycemia following ETI initiation in people with CFRD. Further studies are required to better understand the mechanisms by which ETI may modulate insulin and glucose dynamics in individuals with existing CFRD."

The pharmacokinetics (PK) of ETI are poorly described in published research, particularly when it comes to children. Knowledge of the PK in this population may provide more insight into the exposure-response relationship of the drugs and its corresponding inter-patient variability (IIV). The aim of this study was to evaluate the PK of ETI in cwCF in a real-world setting. A prospective, observational PK study was conducted in cwCF starting with ETI. PK samples were collected at home using dried blood spots (DBS), and during regular outpatient hospital visits. Clinical efficacy and safety data were gathered and evaluated. Population PK (popPK) models were developed using nonlinear mixed-effects modelling. A total of 29 children were included in this study. Novel popPK models were developed for ETI and its main metabolites. There was significant variability in AUC of ETI within and between age groups, aligning with the references in the product information. All children had concentrations within or above the range needed for a clinical response. An exploratory exposure-response analysis found no direct linear relationship between AUC and sweat chloride, or ppFEV1. This study is the first analysis of ETI popPK in cwCF. The developed popPK models may be used to further study the exposure-response relationship and its variability within cwCF, as a basis for more personalized dosing."

A retrospective review of the hospital's electronic medical record database was conducted to identify patients who underwent percutaneous image-guided cryoablation for aneurysmal bone cysts between March 2014 and April 2024. Patients were excluded if they lacked pre- or post-treatment MRI, underwent surgical curettage and bone grafting between cryoablation treatments, or received adjunctive therapies such as sclerotherapy or bone grafting. Demographic data and pre- and post-cryoablation MRI characteristics of the lesions were collected and analyzed. We retrospectively analyzed 20 patients (mean age = 14.6 years). The average ABC volume decreased from 83 cm<sup>3</sup> pre-treatment to 32.7 cm<sup>3</sup> post-treatment. In the final post-treatment MRI, there was a 50% decrease in the cystic component in 90% (n = 18) of patients, improved cortical integrity in 75% (n = 9), resolution of peri-lesional edema and mass effect in all (n = 20), and development of organized fibrosis in 50% (n = 10) of the patients. The average time was 8.3 months for a 50% reduction in cystic component, 7.3 months for improvement in cortical integrity, 6.4 months for improvement in mass effect, 15 months for complete resolution of peri-lesional enhancement, and 16.1 months for the development of organized fibrosis. These findings suggest MRI is a valuable tool for monitoring ABC response to cryotherapy, guiding future treatment protocols."

    "abstract": "Malabsorption is a complex and multifaceted condition characterised by the defective passage of nutrients into the blood and lymphatic streams. Several congenital or acquired disorders may cause either selective or global malabsorption in both children and adults, such as cystic fibrosis, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI), coeliac disease (CD) and other enteropathies, lactase deficiency, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), autoimmune atrophic gastritis, Crohn's disease, and gastric or small bowel resections. Early recognition of malabsorption is key for tailoring a proper diagnostic work-up for identifying the cause of malabsorption. Patient's medical and pharmacological history are essential for identifying risk factors. Several examinations like endoscopy with small intestinal biopsies, non-invasive functional tests, and radiologic imaging are useful in diagnosing malabsorption. Due to its high prevalence, CD should always be looked for in case of malabsorption with no other obvious explanations and in high-risk individuals. Nutritional support is key in management of patients with malabsorption; different options are available, including oral supplements, enteral or parenteral nutrition. In patients with short bowel syndrome, teduglutide proved effective in reducing the need for parenteral nutrition, thus improving the quality of life of these patients. Primary care physicians have a central role in early detection of malabsorption and should be involved into multidisciplinary teams for improving the overall management of these patients. In this European consensus, involving 10 scientific societies and several experts, we have dissected all the issues around malabsorption, including the definitions and diagnostic testing (Part 1), high-risk categories and special populations, nutritional assessment and management, and primary care perspective (Part 2)."

It is typically seen in asthmatic patients and those with cystic fibrosis. Lack of clinical suspicion and misdiagnosis often make the management of this condition difficult. We are reporting a case of ABPA that was diagnosed and managed at Divisional Railway Hospital, Kharagpur, South Eastern Railway. The patient was a 66-year-old female who presented with fever, cough, and shortness of breath. She had been asthmatic since childhood and was on treatment for the same. On initial evaluation, her clinical and radiological features were suggestive of community-acquired pneumonia and were treated with antibiotics. However, the patient did not show improvement, and asthma also remained poorly controlled despite treatment. This raised the possibility of ABPA in this patient. The International Society for Human and Animal Mycology-ABPA (ISHAM-ABPA) working group criterion was used for making the diagnosis. She was successfully managed with low-dose steroids and itraconazole. A high index of clinical suspicion is needed for timely detection of ABPA. Features of nonresolving pneumonia in the background of poorly controlled asthma raised the possibility of ABPA in this patient. Misdiagnosis and delay in initiating proper treatment can lead to permanent lung damage, such as bronchiectasis and lung fibrosis, which can even lead to life-threatening complications like cor pulmonale and respiratory failure."

    "abstract": "Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a life-limiting, inherited condition in which a novel class of oral medicine, CFTR modulators, has revolutionised symptoms and health indicators, providing an opportunity to evaluate traditional treatment regimens with the hope of reducing burden. Additionally, there is cautious optimism that life expectancy for people with CF born today could ultimately compare to that of the general population. Given this potential, there is a need and requirement to optimise treatment to balance burden with the best clinical outcomes for each person with CF in an individualised manner. Personalised data-Linkage to Understand Treatment Optimisation (PLUTO) is a clinical framework, developed within the 14-Centre UK CFHealthHub Learning Health System collaborative, designed for use at an individual level for people with CF taking CFTR modulators. The PLUTO framework encourages use of two routinely collected clinical outcome measure (FEV1 and BMI) to determine health status. Where FEV1 or BMI trends suggest that optimal health outcomes are not being achieved for a person with CF, PLUTO supports consideration of adherence to both CFTR modulators and inhaled therapy to help guide the next steps. PLUTO is designed to support people with CF and their clinical teams to individualise care and optimise outcomes for those taking CFTR modulators, using data available in routine clinical encounters."

    "title": "Cell envelope polysaccharide modifications alter the surface properties and interactions of <i>Mycobacterium abscessus</i> with innate immune cells in a morphotype-dependent manner.",
    "abstract": "<i>Mycobacterium abscessus</i> is one of the leading causes of pulmonary infections caused by non-tuberculous mycobacteria. The ability of <i>M. abscessus</i> to establish a chronic infection in the lung relies on a series of adaptive mutations impacting, in part, global regulators and cell envelope biosynthetic enzymes. One of the genes under strong evolutionary pressure during host adaptation is <i>ubiA</i>, which participates in the elaboration of the arabinan domains of two major cell envelope polysaccharides: arabinogalactan (AG) and lipoarabinomannan (LAM). We here show that patient-derived UbiA mutations not only cause alterations in the AG, LAM, and mycolic acid contents of <i>M. abscessus</i> but also tend to render the bacterium more prone to forming biofilms while evading uptake by innate immune cells and enhancing their pro-inflammatory properties. The fact that the effects of UbiA mutations on the physiology and pathogenicity of <i>M. abscessus</i> were impacted by the rough or smooth morphotype of the strain suggests that the timing of their selection relative to morphotype switching may be key to their ability to promote chronic persistence in the host.IMPORTANCEMultidrug-resistant pulmonary infections caused by <i>Mycobacterium abscessus</i> and subspecies are increasing in the U.S.A. and globally. Little is known of the mechanisms of pathogenicity of these microorganisms. We have identified single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a gene involved in the biosynthesis of two major cell envelope polysaccharides, arabinogalactan and lipoarabinomannan, in lung-adapted isolates from 13 patients. Introduction of these individual SNPs in a reference <i>M. abscessus</i> strain allowed us to study their impact on the physiology of the bacterium and its interactions with immune cells. The significance of our work is in identifying some of the mechanisms used by <i>M. abscessus</i> to colonize and persist in the human lung, which will facilitate the early detection of potentially more virulent clinical isolates and lead to new therapeutic strategies. Our findings may further have broader biomedical impacts, as the <i>ubiA</i> gene is conserved in other tuberculous and non-tuberculous mycobacterial pathogens."

In contrast to Europe and the USA, the treatment eligibility profile of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients in Türkiye is not known. In this study we aimed to determine the eligibility of CF patients in Türkiye for the CFTRms. The Cystic Fibrosis Registry of Türkiye (CFrT) data was used to determine the age of patients in the year 2021 and the genetic variants they were carrying. Age- and CFTR-variant appropriate modulator therapies were determined using the Vertex® algorithm. Among a total of 1930 registered patients, CTFR gene analysis was performed on a total of 1841 (95.4%) patients. Mutations were detected in one allele in 10.7% (198 patients), and in both alleles in 79% (1455 patients) of patients. A total of 855 patients (51.7% for whom at least 1 mutation was detected) were eligible for the drugs. The most appropriate drug among genotyped patients was found to be elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor for 486 patients (26.4%), followed by ivacaftor for 327 patients (17.7%) and lumacaftor/ivacaftor for 42 patients (2%). Only half of patients registered in CFrT were eligible for CFTRms, which is a significant difference from the CFTR variant profile seen in USA and Europe. However, access to treatment is hampered for some patients whose genes are not analysed. Further studies in CF populations, where rare mutations are relatively more common, will contribute to the field of CFTR modulator treatments for such rare mutations."

    "abstract": "The coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic has been a very significant health issue in the period between 2020 and 2023, forcing research to characterize severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) sequences and to develop novel therapeutic approaches. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-8 are considered significant therapeutic targets for COVID-19 and emerging evidence has suggested that microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) serve a key role in regulating these genes. MiRNAs are short, 19-25 nucleotides in length, non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level through the sequence-selective recognition of the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of the regulated mRNAs, eventually repressing translation, commonly, via mRNA degradation. For example, among several miRNAs involved in the regulation of the COVID-19 'cytokine storm', miR-93-5p can inhibit IL-8 gene expression by directly targeting the 3'-UTR of IL-8 mRNA. In addition, miR-93-5p can regulate Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) and interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 4 (IRAK4) expression, thus affecting the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway and the expression of NF-κB-regulated genes, such as IL-6, IL-1β and other hyper-expressed genes during the COVID-19 'cytokine storm'. In the present study, the results provided preliminary evidence suggesting that the miR-93-5p-based miRNA therapeutics could be combined with the anti-inflammatory aged garlic extract (AGE) to more effectively inhibit IL-8 gene expression. The human bronchial epithelial IB3-1 cell line was employed as experimental model system. IB3-1 cells were stimulated with the BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine and transfected with pre-miR-93-5p in the absence or in the presence of AGE, to verify the inhibitory effects on the BNT162b2-induced expression of the IL-8 gene. The accumulation of IL-8 mRNA was assessed by RT-qPCR; the release of IL-8 protein was determined by Bio-Plex assay. In addition, the possible applications of TLR4/NF-κB inhibitory agents (such as miR-93-5p and AGE) for treating human pathologies at a hyperinflammatory state, such as COVID-19, cystic fibrosis and other respiratory diseases, were summarized."

A systematic search of major databases conducted between December 2019 and January 2024 identified eight cohort studies comprising 1,361 CF patients. Studies without subgroup analyses specific to CF patients were excluded, which may have limited the generalizability of findings, particularly for CF lung transplant recipients. COVID-19 vaccines generally induced robust serological responses following the second and third doses, although reduced antibody levels were observed in lung transplant recipients. Factors influencing humoral response included prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, age, inhaled corticosteroid use, and immunosuppressive therapy. Vaccination-related adverse events were predominantly mild. Although breakthrough infections were reported, severe COVID-19 outcomes were infrequent among vaccinated CF patients. The evidence supports the immunogenicity and safety of COVID-19 vaccines in the CF patients. However, individualized vaccination strategies may be necessary for CF lung transplant recipients and those on immunosuppressive therapies. Further research is essential to optimize vaccination strategies and to identify risk factors associated with breakthrough infections in this high-risk population."

Here, we show that knee OA induces a surge in plasma ACBP/DBI in mice subjected to surgical destabilization of one hind limb. Knockout of the Dbi gene or intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of a monoclonal antibody (mAb) neutralizing ACBP/DBI attenuates OA progression in this model, supporting a pathogenic role for ACBP/DBI in OA. Furthermore, anti-ACBP/DBI mAb was also effective against OA after its intraarticular (i.a.) injection, as monitored by sonography, revealing the capacity of ACBP/DBI to locally reduce knee inflammation over time. In addition, i.a. anti-ACBP/DBI mAb improved functional outcomes, as indicated by the reduced weight imbalance caused by OA. At the anatomopathological level, i.a. anti-ACBP/DBI mAb mitigated histological signs of joint destruction and synovial inflammation. Of note, i.a. anti-ACBP/DBI mAb blunted the OA-induced surge of plasma ACBP/DBI, as well as that of other inflammatory factors including interleukin-1α, interleukin-33, and tumor necrosis factor. These findings are potentially translatable to OA patients because joints from OA patients express both ACBP/DBI and its receptor GABA<sub>A</sub>Rγ2. Moreover, a novel mAb against ACBP/DBI recognizing an epitope conserved between human and mouse ACBP/DBI demonstrated similar efficacy in mitigating OA as an anti-mouse ACBP/DBI-only mAb. In conclusion, ACBP/DBI might constitute a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of OA."

    "abstract": "Autosomal Dominant and Autosomal Recessive Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD and ARPKD) are, respectively, common and rare forms of polycystic disorders, characterized by the formation and progressive growth of cysts from tubules in the kidneys and bile ducts in the liver. Alterations in the extracellular matrix (ECM) and in the activity of matrix metalloproteases (MMPs), both associated with fibrosis, have been shown to be important factors in cystic growth and progression of these diseases. We used tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to identify the most enriched proteins and pathways in an orthologous rapidly progressive mouse model of ADPKD: Pkd1<sup>flox/flox</sup>TamCre. This information was used to discover and validate novel therapeutic targets in orthologous models of ADPKD (Pkd1<sup>flox/flox</sup>TamCre) and ARPKD (Pkdh1<sup>del3-4/del3-4</sup>). ECM related pathways and expression levels of MMPs were among the most dysregulated cellular processes in polycystic kidney and liver. Selective inhibition of MMPs by marimastat (MTT) altered the ECM response and resulted in inhibition of collecting duct-derived cyst growth, delay of global kidney cyst progression and rescue of liver phenotype by normalized MMPs expression and significant reduction in fibrosis. This phenotypic improvement was further enhanced by treatment of MTT and tolvaptan, indicating an additive benefit to targeting the fibrotic and growth pathways in cysts. As conclusion, targeting of MMPs are important in ECM dysregulation and offers a new potential therapeutic strategy for both kidney and bile duct derived fibrocystic disease in ADPKD and ARPKD. Such approaches can have additive benefits with other treatment approaches, such as tolvaptan."

    "abstract": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a prominent bacterial pathogen that causes several nosocomial infections and is notorious for its environmental resilience and rapid development of resistance to frontline antibiotics. A major cause of mortality and morbidity among cystic fibrosis patients, multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa is often targeted with the antibiotic colistin as a last option. However, increasing reports of colistin resistance among P. aeruginosa is a significant concern. Though the molecular mechanisms responsible for the development of colistin resistance are well known, the evolutionary trajectory to colistin resistance is an important area of investigation. In this work, using the adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE) approach we have evolved a colistin-sensitive P. aeruginosa ancestral strain to a resistant one. During the process of laboratory evolution in 106 generations, colistin MIC was increased 32-fold. The evolved strain had lower fitness than the ancestral strain, as evidenced by a lower growth rate. Moreover, the evolved strain produced more biofilm and less pyocyanin pigment. Interestingly, the evolved strain showed collateral sensitivity to several antibiotics, including ampicillin, tetracycline, streptomycin, gentamycin, nalidixic acid, trimethoprim, rifampicin, and chloramphenicol. On analysing various TCS modules involved in the development of colistin resistance, a novel missense mutation (V136G) was detected in the PmrB sensor kinase. In silico analysis indicated that the V136G substitution would destabilize the PmrB kinase structure, making the mutation deleterious. However, the functionality of the PmrB mutant remains to be validated experimentally."

In children with cystic fibrosis (CF), conventional radiography or computed tomography (CT) has been the main modality used to evaluate acute pneumonia or the progression of chronic lung disease. This Study aimed to evaluate Lung-Ultrasound as a diagnostic tool for children and adolescents with CF. We examined 30 CF patients with lung ultrasound before and after spirometry and compared them with lung ultrasounds of 15 lung-healthy children. We used a comprehensive and complete examination procedure with 12 probe positions to determine the best examination procedure in retrospect. In addition, an acceptance survey was conducted among the children and adolescents after the examination. There was a significant difference in pleural irregularities, B-lines, consolidations and the adapted Peixoto et al. score between CF patients and healthy children before spirometry. We found excellent discrimination between patients and lung-healthy subjects using the Peixoto-score (AUC 0.968), pleural irregularities (AUC 0.890). CF patients had more B-lines, more consolidations, and a higher Peixoto score (mean difference 7.7 points). There was no significant difference in lung ultrasound results in children with CF before and after spirometry. Shortening our extended examination procedure would minimally compromise diagnostic accuracy. The lung ultrasound examination was well accepted by the children. We could demonstrate that lung ultrasound is a sensitive and reliable method for assessing pulmonary changes in cystic fibrosis."

Of note, 893 pathogenic genetic variants were identified.The genetic variants most frequently observed in all the individuals studied were associated with the following diseases (carrier frequency): alpha thalassemia (10.5%), alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (10%), congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency (9.4%), cystic fibrosis (7.3%), spinal muscular atrophy type 1 (5.6%) and Stargardt disease type 1 (5.0%). The most frequent genetic variant observed in the subgroup of Colombian origin individuals was associated with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (11.3%). Information on the frequency of recessive diseases in Colombia is limited. This pioneering carrier genetic screening identified a high percentage of carriers for at least one recessive autosomal or X-linked in the population evaluated. Screening for recessive mutations could lead to an evolution in family planning programs and a decrease in the number of patients affected by recessive disorders. Furthermore, it could become a routine test not only in cases of assisted reproduction but also in cases of natural gestation."

    "abstract": "Inequitable access to transplant in the US is well recognized, yet the nature and extent of upstream disparities in care prior to transplant are unknown. To understand patterns of referral for lung transplant by race, ethnicity, and neighborhood-level socioeconomic status. This retrospective cohort study included adults aged 18 to 80 years with obstructive and restrictive lung disease from a single large-volume transplant center in Cleveland, Ohio, who were diagnosed between January 1, 2006, and May 11, 2023. Neighborhood resources. The main outcome was the transition to the next stage of the transplant care continuum, death, or a lapse in care. Cause-specific Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to account for death as a competing risk, adjusting for age at index encounter (respective to each cohort), diagnosis, and sex as covariates. This study included 30 050 patients with obstructive and restrictive lung disease with primary care encounters (mean [SD] age, 65 [13] years; 56.1% female), 73 817 with a pulmonary medicine encounter, 4198 undergoing lung transplant evaluation, and 1378 on the lung transplant waiting list. In a multivariable model including age, diagnosis, sex, area deprivation index, and race and ethnicity (including 3.3% Hispanic, 15.2% non-Hispanic Black, and 81.5% non-Hispanic White individuals), patients residing in the least-resourced neighborhoods were 97% more likely to die without transitioning to pulmonary medicine (hazard ratio [HR], 1.97 [95% CI, 1.78-2.17]), 90% more likely to die prior to lung transplant evaluation (HR, 1.90 [95% CI, 1.77-2.04]), 40% more likely to die prior to placement on the waiting list (HR, 1.40 [95% CI, 1.11-1.76]), and 97% more likely to die prior to transplant (HR, 1.97 [95% CI, 1.18-3.29]) compared with patients residing in the most-resourced neighborhoods. These patients were also 13% less likely to transition to pulmonary medicine (HR, 0.87 [95% CI, 0.82-0.92]) and 45% less likely to be placed on the waiting list (HR, 0.55 [95% CI, 0.44-0.68]) despite a 69% increased likelihood of transplant evaluation (HR, 1.69 [95% CI, 1.36-2.09]). While non-Hispanic Black patients had lower risks of death across all stages of care, they experienced a 39% lower likelihood of proceeding to lung transplant evaluation (HR, 0.61 [95% CI, 0.51-0.74]). Racial differences in the cumulative incidence of waiting list placement were found, but differences were not consistent across levels of neighborhood resources. In this retrospective cohort study of patients diagnosed with restrictive and obstructive pulmonary disease, increased mortality risks and decreased likelihood of care escalations for patients who were socioeconomically disadvantaged and for racial and ethnic minority patients were found. These results suggest potential interventions for advancing equitable access to lung transplant."

    "abstract": "To distinguish pathogens from commensals, the intestinal epithelium employs cytosolic innate immune sensors. Activation of the NAIP-NLRC4 inflammasome initiates extrusion of infected intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) upon cytosolic bacterial sensing. We previously reported that activation of the inflammasome in tuft cells, which are primarily known for their role in parasitic infections, leads to the release of prostaglandin D2 (PGD2). We observe that NAIP-NLRC4 inflammasome activation in tuft cells leads to an antibacterial response with increased IL-22 and antimicrobial protein levels within the small intestine, which is dependent on PGD2 signaling. A NKp46+ subset of ILC3 expresses the PGD2 receptor CRTH2 and is the source of the increased IL-22. Inflammasome activation in tuft cells also leads to better control of Salmonella Typhimurium in the distal small intestine. However, tuft cells in the cecum and colon are dispensable for antibacterial immunity. These data support that intestinal tuft cells can also induce antibacterial responses, possibly in a tissue-specific manner."

    "abstract": "Mycobacterium abscessus is an important cause of pulmonary infections, particularly among people with cystic fibrosis. Current treatment options for M. abscessus are suboptimal. Apramycin is a promising alternative aminoglycoside for M. abscessus, in part due to its ability to avoid intrinsic aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes in this pathogen. Define the pharmacodynamic activity of apramycin doses against M. abscessus. Apramycin and amikacin pharmacodynamics were assessed against two amikacin-susceptible M. abscessus subsp. abscessus isolates (ATCC 19977 and NR-44261) using a 14-day hollow fibre infection model (HFIM). Viable bacterial counts were determined during exposure to amikacin (15-20 mg/kg q24h) and 3 fractionated doses of apramycin (15 mg/kg q12h, 30 mg/kg q24h, 60 mg/kg q48h) using pharmacokinetic profiles predicted in epithelial lining fluid. Against ATCC 19977, apramycin activity exceeded that of amikacin, with maximum bacterial reductions between 1.51 and 2.18 log10 cfu/mL for the different doses. Apramycin 15 mg/kg q12h displayed slightly better killing compared with the other apramycin dosing regimens between 96 and 144h before regrowth occurred. NR-44261 was not inhibited by amikacin and the activity of apramycin against this isolate was similar between the three doses (∼0.5 log10 cfu/mL reductions). After 14 days of exposure to apramycin monotherapy, ATCC 19977 and NR-44261 became apramycin resistant with MICs of >32 mg/L. Apramycin exhibited greater pharmacodynamic activity than amikacin against amikacin-susceptible M. abscessus isolates and may be a promising therapy for this pathogen. However, antibiotic combination strategies to minimize apramycin resistance from emerging may be necessary."

    "title": "Assessing respiratory therapists' compliance with cystic fibrosis guidelines in Saudi Arabia: A descriptive quantitative study.",
    "abstract": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a severe autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. This condition disrupts chloride channels and leads to the production of thick, sticky mucus, affecting the respiratory and gastrointestinal systems. CF's prevalence is particularly high in Saudi Arabia, where the incidence has increased from 1 in 2,000 to 1 in 1,000 births. Effective management of CF is essential for improving patient outcomes, yet there is a notable lack of understanding regarding respiratory therapists' (RTs) adherence to established CF management protocols. This descriptive quantitative study aimed to assess RTs' adherence to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation's guidelines. Using a convenience sampling technique, a self-report survey was distributed to 750 members of the Saudi Society for Respiratory Care (SSRC), resulting in 351 responses, of which 166 were fully completed and met the inclusion criteria. The survey focused on RTs' knowledge and management practices related to CF. Data analysis was conducted using SPSS version 25, with descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, frequency, percentage, and mode) and non-parametric tests. The Kruskal-Wallis Test was employed to evaluate differences in adherence scores across demographic groups (e.g., education level, years of experience). Chi-square analysis was applied to examine relationships between categorical demographic variables (e.g., region of practice) and adherence to guidelines. The analysis revealed significant gaps in RTs' adherence to CF guidelines, with only 42.8% accurately identifying the sweat chloride threshold for CF diagnosis and a limited 36.1% recognizing Pseudomonas aeruginosa as a common CF pathogen. Additionally, just 56.6% correctly identified the gold-standard airway clearance therapy. The Wilcoxon signed-ranks test further highlighted a statistically significant disparity (p = 0.00) between RTs' theoretical knowledge and practical application of CF management techniques, emphasizing the need for improved training. The findings suggest a need for enhanced training and resources to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical management of CF. The lack of adherence to clinical guidelines could impact patient outcomes and survival rates. Improving RTs' adherence to CF management guidelines through ongoing education and updated clinical standards is essential. Addressing these gaps could elevate the standard of care and contribute to better patient outcomes and survival rates in Saudi Arabia."

    "abstract": "Little information is available regarding whether active physical activity lowers mortality risk in individuals with bronchiectasis. We used the Korean National Health Insurance Service database from 2010 to 2016 to evaluate the association between changes in physical activity and mortality risk in individuals with bronchiectasis. Of 552,510 individuals with newly diagnosed bronchiectasis, we enrolled 165,842 individuals who had two consecutive health examinations before and after bronchiectasis diagnosis, within two years, as the study aimed to measure changes in exercise habits between the two time points. Active physical activity was defined as engaging in moderate- or vigorous-intensity physical activity at least once a week, either before or after bronchiectasis diagnosis. The outcome measure was all-cause mortality. During a mean follow-up of 6.2 ± 2.1 years, 10,535 (6.4%) individuals with bronchiectasis died. Individuals with bronchiectasis who were physically active exhibited a lower mortality rate than those who were physically inactive. Mortality reduction was particularly evident in the exercise maintainers group (aHR [adjusted hazard ratio] = 0.69, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.64-0.74) and individuals with physical activity ≥1,000 metabolic equivalent of task-min per week (aHR = 0.73, 95% CI = 0.70-0.77) compared to those who were physically inactive. Engaging in active physical activity is associated with a decreased risk of mortality in individuals with bronchiectasis."

    "abstract": "Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency in cystic fibrosis (CF) increases fecal choline losses, but the postnatal course of plasma choline and its metabolites in these patients is unknown. While choline homeostasis is crucial for cellular, bile, and lipoprotein metabolism, via phosphatidylcholine (PC) and via betaine as a methyl donor, choline deficiency is associated with impaired lung and liver function, including hepatic steatosis. The goal of our study was to evaluate the plasma levels of choline, betaine, trimethylamine oxide (TMAO), PC, and PC subclasses in CF patients from infancy to adulthood and compare those with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) to those with pancreatic sufficiency (EPS). Retrospective analysis of target parameters in plasma samples (July 2015-November 2023) of CF patients (0.64-24.6 years) with tandem mass spectrometry. A total of 477 samples from 162 CF patients were analyzed. In CF patients with EPI (N = 148), plasma choline and betaine concentrations were lower and decreased with age compared to EPS patients showing normal values. TMAO concentrations, indicating intestinal choline degradation by bacterial colonization, were frequently elevated in EPI from infancy onwards, and inversely related to plasma choline and betaine levels. PC-containing linoleic acid levels were lower in EPI, but arachidonic and docosahexaenoic acid content was similar in both patient groups. CF patients with EPI are at risk of choline and betaine deficiency compared to exocrine pancreas-sufficient CF patients. Elevated TMAO concentrations in EPI patients indicate increased bacterial colonization leading to choline degradation before absorption. These findings indicate that laboratory testing of choline, betaine, and TMAO as well as clinical trials on choline supplementation are warranted in CF patients."

    "abstract": "Atherosclerosis (AS) is a disease characterised by the accumulation of atherosclerotic plaques on the inner walls of blood vessels, resulting in their narrowing. In its early stages, atherosclerosis remains asymptomatic and undetectable by conventional pathological methods. However, as the disease progresses, it can lead to a series of cardiovascular diseases, which are a leading cause of mortality among middle-aged and elderly populations worldwide. Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are composed of chromatin and granular proteins released by neutrophils. Upon activation by external stimuli, neutrophils undergo a series of reactions, resulting in the release of NETs and subsequent cell death, a process termed NETosis. Research has demonstrated that NETosis is a means by which neutrophils contribute to immune responses. However, studies on neutrophil extracellular traps have identified NETs as the primary cause of various inflammation-induced diseases, including cystic fibrosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and rheumatoid arthritis. Consequently, the present review will concentrate on the impact of neutrophil extracellular traps on atherosclerosis formation, analysing it from a molecular biology perspective. This will involve a systematic dissection of their proteomic components and signal pathways."

    "abstract": "The introduction of CFTR modulators in the clinics has improved body mass index in cystic fibrosis (CF) individuals. Leptin is a major regulator of appetite and energy expenditure but is also involved in bone metabolism. Whether circulating leptin levels are associated with low bone mineral density (BMD) and fracture risk in CF remains unknown. Therefore, the present study aims to analyze and integrate the current evidence linking leptin and bone loss in CF. As no scientific evidence was found, we focused on secondary dysregulations of bone loss in CF that may be linked to pathologies that are similar to the various dysregulations and multisystemic manifestations in CF. Studies published from 2001 to 2022 were identified through the PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases, and screening was performed following the PRISMA guidelines. The included studies were assessed using a quality checklist. From the 774 records identified, 28 studies met the inclusion criteria. Although no evidence has been found directly related to bone loss in CF individuals, some studies revealed a positive association between leptin levels and BMD, while others found an inverse association. Current evidence suggests that for circulating leptin levels to be a predictive biomarker of bone health, further research will be needed to reveal the direct and indirect mechanisms behind leptin and bone loss and to understand whether changes in leptin levels correlate with changes in BMD. Of note, studies with CF people would be of high importance to understand the role of leptin in CF-related bone disease."

It is one of the main causes of severe nosocomial infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia, chronic infections in patients with cystic fibrosis, and bloodstream infections in immunosuppressed individuals. Development of vaccines against <i>P. aeruginosa</i> is a major challenge owing to the high capacity of this bacterium to form biofilms, its wide arsenal of virulence factors (including secretion systems, lipopolysaccharides, and outer membrane proteins), and its ability to evade the host immune system. This review provides a comprehensive historical overview of vaccine development efforts targeting this pathogen, ranging from early attempts in the 1970s to recent advancements, including vaccines based on novel proteins and emerging technologies such as nanoparticles and synthetic conjugates. Despite numerous promising preclinical developments, very few candidates have progressed to clinical trials, and none have achieved final approval. This panorama highlights the significant scientific efforts undertaken and the inherent complexity of successfully developing an effective vaccine against <i>P. aeruginosa</i>."

    "abstract": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is characterized by chronic respiratory infections and excessive inflammation, driven by both host- and pathogen-derived proteases. The dysregulated activity of proteolytic enzymes such as neutrophil elastase (NE), cathepsin G, and matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) degrades lung tissue, exacerbates airway remodeling, and perpetuates inflammatory cycles. Concurrently, bacterial proteases from pathogens such as <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> and <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> contribute to immune evasion and tissue destruction, compounding disease severity. Despite advances in antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory therapies, protease-driven lung damage remains a critical challenge. This review examines the dual role of host and bacterial proteases in CF pathophysiology, highlighting emerging protease-targeted therapies aimed at mitigating lung damage and inflammation. Strategies explored include the inhibition of NE, MMPs, and bacterial proteases, with a focus on innovative therapeutic approaches such as dual-function inhibitors, biologics, and advanced drug delivery systems. By restoring the protease-antiprotease balance, these interventions offer the potential to improve clinical outcomes and quality of life for CF patients."

This study aimed to investigate cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) variants in Chinese families and assess their association with pregnancy complications and neonatal outcomes. This prospective cohort study included 446 Chinese families (148 natural conceptions, 298 ART conceptions) who underwent whole genome sequencing. We analyzed the frequency of pathogenic/likely pathogenic CFTR variants and their association with preterm birth (PTB), pregnancy complications, and neonatal outcomes. Twelve pathogenic/likely pathogenic CFTR variants were identified, with K464N (c.1392G > T) being the most prevalent (2.9% of cohort). PTB incidence was significantly higher in pregnancies with fetal CFTR variants (43.1%, 22/51) compared to those without (17.5%, 69/395; p < 0.001). Fetuses carrying the CFTR K464N variant exhibited a 3.39-fold increased risk of PTB (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.39-8.23, p = 0.007) after adjusting for confounders. Neither fetal nor maternal CFTR variants were significantly associated with other neonatal outcomes, including neonatal weight, Apgar scores, respiratory distress, or hyperbilirubinemia (p > 0.050). These findings suggest a potential association between fetal CFTR K464N variant and increased risk of preterm birth in Chinese families, highlighting the importance of considering CFTR genotyping in prenatal care."

Female CF patients face considerable fertility challenges, with higher prevalence of deficient fertility compared to healthy women. Not much is known about the underlying causes. In particular, the pathobiology of the endometrium, the uterus' inner lining essential for pregnancy and expressing fluctuating CFTR levels during the menstrual cycle, is unexplored in CF. To address this gap, we developed organoid models from CF patient endometrium. The organoids recapitulated CF characteristics and revealed molecular and pathway differences in cycle-recapitulating hormone responses compared to healthy endometrial organoids. Furthermore, specific functional aberrations were restored by CFTR modulator treatment. To further complement human organoid models for unraveling endometrial pathobiology in CF, we also developed organoids from a genetic CF mouse model that were also found to recapitulate CF characteristics. Moreover, single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis of the CF mouse uterus revealed molecular traits in the endometrium similar to the human CF endometrium (as evidenced by its organoid model). Our study provides new endometrium models to advance our understanding of CF-associated endometrial pathobiology, particularly regarding menstrual cycle aberrations that impact fertility. This research is timely since improved CF therapeutics result in increased life expectancy, allowing more CF patients to consider starting a family."

Linear mixed-effects models were used to examine the relationship between CRP and vitality adjusted for age, sex, BMI, and lung function. Our findings demonstrated a significant, independent inverse association between CRP and vitality. These results highlight the potential role of systemic inflammation in influencing vitality in awCF undergoing ETI therapy.

    "abstract": "(1) Background: <i>Cystic echinococcosis</i> (CE) is an <i>Echinococcus granulosus</i>-induced worldwide parasitic zoonosis and is a recognized public health and socio-economic concern. The liver is the major target organ for CE's infective form protoscolex (PSCs), which causes serious liver damage and endangers the host's life. Reports show that PSC infection causes liver cell Fe<sup>2+</sup> metabolism disorder and abnormal deposition of Fe<sup>2+</sup> in liver cells and results in liver cell death. However, whether PSC-induced liver cell death is associated with ferroptosis remains to be clarified. (2) Methods: Using both an in vivo rat model and an in vitro co-culture of PSCs and the cell system, we studied the histopathological progress of PSCs infection and the cytopathogenesis of PSC-induced cell death in the liver. Hepatic-injury-related ferroptosis signaling pathways were identified by proteomics analysis at various stages of PSCs infection, and physiological and the biochemical indexes and expression of pathway proteins related to hepatic ferroptosis were studied. Ferrostatin-1, a ferroptosis inhibitor, was employed for in vivo interference with early protoscolices infection in rats, and the effects of the inhibition of hepatocyte ferroptosis on hepatocyte injury and the generation of fibrotic cysts were investigated. Additionally, PSCs were exposed to in vitro co-culture with BRL, a rat hepatocyte line, to clarify the direct influences of PSCs on BRL ferroptosis. (3) Results: The results of our in vivo studies revealed that PSCs infection induced Fe<sup>2+</sup> enrichment in liver cells surrounding the PSCs cysts, cellular oxidation, and liver tissue damage along with the prolongation of PSCs parasitism. The results of our in vitro studies verified the ability of PSCs to directly induce ferroptosis, the formation of fibrotic cysts, and alteration of the iron metabolism of liver cells. The analysis of KEGG signaling pathways revealed that ferroptosis- and ROS-related pathways were significantly induced with PSCs infection. Using Ferrostatin-1 effectively blocked ferroptosis, reversed Fe<sup>2+</sup> content, reduced liver cell oxidation, and reduced PSC-induced fibrosis cysts. (4) Conclusions: Our study reveals the histopathological progress of PSC infection and the cytopathogenesis of PSC-induced ferroptosis. Ferrostatin-1 effectively blocked PSCs infection and PSC-induced cell death in vivo and in vitro. Accordingly, the inhibition of PSC-induced hepatocyte ferroptosis may be an effective method in the control of <i>Echinococcus granulosus</i> infection and should be seriously considered in clinical studies."

Malnutrition in CF now includes an increasing prevalence of overweight and obesity, particularly in those receiving CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulator therapy (CFTRm). We aimed to characterise peripheral muscle function and body composition in pwCF on Elexacaftor/Tezacaftor/Ivacaftor (ETI) CFTRm, compared to healthy controls. Fifteen pwCF on ETI, and 15 healthy age- and sex-matched controls (CON), underwent whole-body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scans, and a comprehensive evaluation of peripheral muscle function. Tests included quadriceps maximal isometric force measurement, an intermittent isometric quadriceps fatiguing protocol, handgrip strength dynamometry, squat jump height assessment, and 1-min sit-to-stand testing. No significant differences in quadriceps maximal isometric force (CON: 181.60 ± 92.90 Nm vs. CF: 146.15 ± 52.48 Nm, p = 0.21, d = 0.47), handgrip strength (CON: 34 ± 15 kg vs. CF: 31 ± 11 kg, p = 0.62, d = 0.18), peripheral muscle endurance, fatigue, or power were observed between the groups. Moreover, no significant differences in whole-body, trunk or limb lean mass, fat-free mass, fat mass, or whole-body bone mineral density were evident. Comparable peripheral muscle mass and function has been demonstrated in pwCF on ETI, albeit a group with good lung function. Research is needed to confirm these findings longitudinally in pwCF, including those with more severe lung disease, who are less physically active, and have less optimal nutrition and exercise support."

To ascertain the frequency of HFE variants, particularly C282Y (c.845G > A) and H63D (c.187C > G) and to determine if they are associated with variations in the onset and early severity of CF lung disease as well as abnormalities in iron status. We studied with whole genome sequencing and clinical outcome measures in a cohort of 104 children with CF at 5-6 years old who were previously found to show an association between aggregated genetic modifiers and an earlier onset and a more severe lung disease phenotype. In our cohort, 23% have H63D and 11% have C282Y. Lung function at age 6 years and Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections did not differ by HFE variants, but having C282Y was associated with more pulmonary exacerbations in the first 6 years of life. Three patients have H63D/C282Y genotype, and all showed phenotypic expression of hemochromatosis with abnormal iron indices. Our study revealed that the presence of HFE variant C282Y in people with CF may lead to more severe lung disease manifestations beginning in early childhood. There is a risk of hemochromatosis in CF patients with two HFE variants, and thus they should be followed for evidence of iron overload."

Notably, women with NCFB NTM pulmonary disease (NTM-PD) bear a disproportionate burden with NTM rates increasing in this population as well as having consistently higher incidence of NTM-PD compared to men. In contrast, among people with CF, an overall increased risk among women has not been observed. In the United States, the majority of people with CF are taking highly effective cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators, and these numbers are increasing worldwide. The long-term impact of CFTR modulator medications on NTM infections is not entirely understood. Guidelines for the screening, diagnosis, and management of NTM-PD exist for people with NCFB and CF, but do not consider unique implications relevant to women. This review highlights aspects of NTM-PD among women with NCFB and CF, including the epidemiology of NTM infection, special considerations for treatment, and unmet research needs relevant to women with NTM-PD."

    "abstract": "Children with congenital lung disease (CLD) may suffer from long-term complications, such as impairments in lung growth, decreased total lung volume, recurrent lower respiratory tract infections and, in some cases, malignant transformation. we described retrospective data on diagnostic process, clinical and functional data regarding a cohort of symptomatic and asymptomatic children with CLD followed in a single third level center in the last twenty years. 91 children were included in the study. Five classes of disease were examined. Bronchial tree and pulmonary abnormalities represent the most common anomalies. Despite the improved resolution of prenatal diagnosis, most of patients underwent chest CT scan to confirm the initial diagnostic suspicion. The most reported symptoms were wheezing, recurrent respiratory infections and acute respiratory failure. According to malformation type, patients underwent to surgery, endoscopic and/or medical treatment. Improvement of symptoms occurred faster in patients surgically and endoscopically treated. No statistical difference in the number of exacerbations before and after treatment was recorded, as well as no differences in spirometry values were observed among surgically and non-surgically treated children. No malignant transformation was observed in two patients with intra-lobar sequestration and hybrid lesion during the follow up period. the clinical presentation of congenital airway and lung disorders varies significantly depending on the type of malformation, making it challenging to standardize treatment strategies and follow-up programs. Based on our experience, prompt surgical or endoscopic intervention in early symptomatic children leads to faster symptom improvement and normal lung function in the follow-up period. However, further prospective studies are needed to better define optimal treatment strategies for these rare conditions, particularly for asymptomatic patients, for whom management approaches remain poorly established."

    "abstract": "The current development of gynecology services for children and adolescents seeks to meet needs both in the overall population and in patients with rare diseases. In France, the referral center for rare gynecological diseases specializes in four major types of conditions, namely, uterovaginal malformations, hereditary hemorrhagic diseases, rare benign breast diseases, and gynecological repercussions of rare chronic diseases. To describe consecutive patients who had a first visit in 2018-2023 at the referral center for rare gynecological diseases at the Necker Pediatric University Hospital in Paris, France, and who were diagnosed with a condition in any of the four categories listed above. For this single-center retrospective observational cohort study, data from the referral-center database were collected and reviewed. These data included year of birth, age at and reason for first gynecology visit, and rare chronic disease and referring rare-disease center for patients seen for gynecological repercussions of rare chronic diseases. The 704 included patients had a median age of 15.2 years (interquartile range 3.8) at the first visit. Among them, 100 (14.2%) had uterovaginal malformations, 32 (4.6%) hereditary hemorrhagic diseases, 17 (2.4%) rare benign breast diseases, and 555 (78.8%) gynecological repercussions of rare chronic diseases. The leading reasons for the visit were dysmenorrhea (15.6%), menorrhagia (15.5%), uterovaginal malformations (15.2%), and irregular periods (14.9%). Repercussions of rare chronic diseases managed at rare-disease referral centers were by far the leading reason for seeking gynecological expertise in rare diseases. In this complex situation, the underlying disease and its treatments interact with the gynecological manifestations and their treatment, requiring close collaboration among all specialists caring for each patient."

    "abstract": "Functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lung usually assesses lung impairment as ventilation defect percentage (VDP). However, VDP only reflects the overall burden of disease and does not characterize the regional distribution (i.e. pattern) of defects.

To assess the applicability and validity of the DDI to <sup>129</sup>Xe-MRI and PREFUL-MRI of CF lung disease. The DDI algorithm was applied to fractional ventilation maps previously acquired with <sup>129</sup>Xe-MRI and PREFUL-MRI of 37 children with CF and 13 healthy controls. The calculation of DDI was feasible for all MRI data. DDI was significantly higher in patients with CF compared to healthy controls (mean difference [95 % CI] <sup>129</sup>Xe-MRI DDI<sub>60 %mean</sub> -1.94 [-2.86 - -1.02], p=0.0001), strongly correlated with other functional outcomes such as VDP and the lung clearance index, and decreased significantly in CF patients with pulmonary exacerbations after antibiotic treatment (e.g. <sup>129</sup>Xe-MRI DDI<sub>60 % mean</sub> -1.03 [-0.44 - -1.63], p=0.002). The DDI is applicable to functional <sup>129</sup>Xe-MRI and PREFUL-MRI data providing complementary information to VDP by assessing defect distribution rather than defect size. It shows meaningful clinimetric properties and improves with treatment. The DDI shows potential as a parameter for comprehensive monitoring of CF lung disease and treatment."

    "abstract": "Recent studies revealed that some people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF) receiving the full dose of Elexacaftor/Tezacaftor/Ivacaftor (ETI) experience adverse events (AEs), leading to discontinuation or dose adjustments of their modulator treatment. We aimed to investigate if pwCF who experienced AEs had high exposure to ETI, and to what extent dose reduction resulted in changes in exposure, side effects and efficacy. This retrospective case series presents ETI exposure in pwCF who required ETI dose reduction due to AEs. ETI exposure was measured by minimal concentration (C<sub>min</sub>) levels, while sweat chloride concentration (SCC) was used to assess efficacy. AEs were graded using the common terminology criteria for AEs. Ten pwCF who experienced AEs during ETI treatment were included in the study. The mean C<sub>min</sub> levels at the full ETI dose were 10.1 mg/L for elexacaftor, 4.2 mg/L for tezacaftor, and 1.2 mg/L for ivacaftor. These values exceed the mean C<sub>min</sub> values from the registration studies, which are 5.5 mg/L for elexacaftor, 2.1 mg/L for tezacaftor, and 0.8 mg/L for ivacaftor. The most frequently reported AEs were psychiatric and nervous system disorders. In all ten pwCF, an improvement of AEs was noted after dose reduction. The mean SCC measured on the full ETI dose was 38 mmol/L. Post dose reduction, the mean SCC was 44 mmol/L. This study suggest that AEs of ETI in most cases could be related to elevated exposure levels. Dose reduction decreases ETI exposure and AEs while maintaining efficacy as determined with sweat chloride levels."

    "title": "Sweating It Out: When Meconium Ileus Is Not Cystic Fibrosis-A Case Report.",
    "abstract": "Meconium ileus (MI) is the result of the accumulation of thick, dry, inspissated meconium that creates a bowel blockage, most commonly in the terminal ileum. These pockets of meconium prevent passage of stool beyond the point of obstruction, which leads to distention of the proximal bowel, bowel wall thickening, and distal microcolon. Occurring most commonly (90%) in conjunction with cystic fibrosis (CF), the occurrence of MI without CF is rare. The literature describes the incidence of MI associated with CF occurring in as many as 24.9% of those who have a pair (homozygous) of the most common CF gene mutation, Delta F508. The incidence of MI decreases with other CF mutations, of which there are over 2,000. The morbidity and mortality risks are related to whether the MI is simple or complex. Simple MI can be managed clinically with contrast enemas to relieve the obstruction and restore bowel function, while complex MI requires surgical intervention for possible bowel necrosis, perforation, peritonitis, strictures, and/or volvulus that can occur in utero or after birth. This article presents a case report of a 32-week-gestation female infant with gross abdominal distention beginning on day of life 1. The differential diagnosis, necessary testing, and required treatment that led to the final diagnosis will be presented. Additionally, radiographic modalities used to confirm the diagnosis are discussed. Finally, nursing management of the infant with simple or complex MI and short- and long-term challenges for infants and their families will be addressed."

Here, we show that off-target intestinal low-dose irradiation (ILDR) increases the clinical benefits of immune checkpoint inhibitors or chemotherapy in eight retrospective cohorts of cancer patients and in tumor-bearing mice. The abscopal effects of ILDR depend on dosimetry (≥1 and ≤3 Gy) and on the metabolic and immune host-microbiota interaction at baseline allowing CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell activation without exhaustion. Various strains of Christensenella minuta selectively boost the anti-cancer efficacy of ILDR and PD-L1 blockade, allowing emigration of intestinal PD-L1-expressing dendritic cells to tumor-draining lymph nodes. An interventional phase 2 study provides the proof-of-concept that ILDR can circumvent resistance to first- or second-line immunotherapy in cancer patients. Prospective clinical trials are warranted to define optimal dosimetry and indications for ILDR to maximize its therapeutic potential."

    "abstract": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a multisystem disease characterized by persistent lung infection. Treatment with elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI) improves respiratory-related quality of life and reduces rates of infection and antibiotic treatments. Reduced antibiotic use may alter bacterial drug resistance patterns. This was a single center, retrospective, observational study analyzing respiratory cultures obtained from people with CF (pwCF) before and after starting ETI therapy. Antibiotic courses and culture data, including susceptibilities, were obtained from the electronic medical record. There were 312 pwCF on ETI included, with an average age at ETI initiation of 20.9 ± 12.0 years and an average length of time on ETI 2.48 ± 0.69 years. Compared to the pre-ETI period, pwCF post-ETI had reductions in the number of antibiotic courses per year (2.5 to 0.7, p < 0.001), antibiotics utilized per course (1.4 to 1.0, p < 0.001), and percentage of courses including intravenous antibiotics (59% to 38%, p < 0.001). The fraction of pwCF with at least one culture positive for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia species, or Stenotrophomonas maltophilia decreased after ETI initiation, though changes were not significant for Staphylococcus aureus. Antibacterial resistance patterns were similar for most antibiotics in pre- and post-ETI periods, with P. aeruginosa exhibiting more resistance to fluoroquinolones post-ETI. Individuals with resistant organisms pre-ETI were less likely to clear the pathogen post-ETI. Treatment with ETI significantly decreased antibiotic utilization and the prevalence of gram-negative organisms. Although fewer antibiotics were used, antibiotic resistance remained unchanged or even increased post-ETI due largely to the greater persistence of resistant organisms."

    "abstract": "Intestinal current measurement (ICM) provides a sensitive bioassay for assessment of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) function in rectal biopsies <i>ex vivo</i> and is used as a diagnostic tool for cystic fibrosis (CF). Furthermore, ICM was shown to be sensitive to detect pharmacological rescue of CFTR function by CFTR modulators in people with CF carrying responsive <i>CFTR</i> mutations. Results from clinical trials of CFTR modulators across age groups indicate that CFTR function in the sweat duct may be age-dependent with children reaching higher levels than adults. However, little is known about age dependency of CFTR function in the intestinal epithelium. We investigated CFTR-mediated chloride secretion in rectal biopsies from 258 people without CF and 72 people with pancreatic-insufficient CF from 1 month to 68 years of age. Change in transepithelial short-circuit current in response to cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-mediated (100 μM IBMX, 1 µM forskolin, basolateral) and cholinergic (100 μM carbachol, basolateral) stimulation was assessed as a readout for CFTR function using perfused micro-Ussing chambers. Furthermore, quantitative real-time PCR of <i>CFTR</i> and morphometric analysis of epithelial cells lining the crypts and surface of the rectal mucosa were performed to assess regulation at the levels of gene expression and epithelial cell densities. We found that CFTR-mediated chloride secretion across rectal tissues, as determined from cAMP-mediated as well as cholinergic chloride-secretory responses was highest during infancy and early childhood and declined with age in people without CF (both P < 0.001). Although, there was no difference in cAMP-mediated currents in people with CF, potassium-secretory responses induced by cholinergic stimulation were also reduced with increasing age. Transcript analyses showed that <i>CFTR</i> mRNA expression was slightly increased with increasing age in people without CF (P < 0.05). Morphometric analyses demonstrated that CFTR expressing colonocytes at the crypt base were decreased with age (P < 0.05). A secondary analysis of the ICM data of our previous studies on the effects of lumacaftor/ivacaftor on CFTR function in <i>F508del</i> -homozygous people with CF aged 12 years and older and 2-11 year old children showed correlations of the change in cAMP-mediated and cholinergic chloride secretory response with the age of people with CF (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05, respectively). These results demonstrate that CFTR function in the rectal epithelium is reduced with increasing age and indicate that this change is likely due to a decline in the number of secretory colonocytes at the crypt base. These findings suggest that differences in CFTR expressing cells may explain increased functional responses to CFTR modulator therapies in children compared to adult people with CF."

Others and we have previously explored the use of alginate lyases in inhibiting <i>P. aeruginosa</i> biofilm formation on plastic and lung epithelial cell monolayers. We now employ a more physiologically representative model system, i.e., three-dimensional aggregates of A549 lung epithelial cells cultured under conditions of microgravity in a rotary cell culture system to mimic the natural lung environment, and a previously isolated clinical strain, <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> CF2843 that we engineered by transposon-mediated integration to express Green Fluorescent Protein and for which we also report the complete genome sequence. Immunostaining and lectin binding studies indicated that the three-dimensional cell aggregates harbored sialylated and fucosylated epitopes as well as Muc1, Muc5Ac, and β-catenin on their surfaces, suggestive of mucin secretion and the presence of tight junctions, hallmark features of lung epithelial tissue. Using this validated model system with confocal microscopy and viable bacterial counts as readouts, we demonstrated that <i>Cellulophaga algicola</i> alginate lyase and <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> Psl glycoside hydrolase, but not <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> Pel glycoside hydrolase, inhibit biofilm formation by <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> on three-dimensional lung epithelial cell aggregates."

We aimed to delineate the spectrum and estimate the prevalence of CF-causing variants in Chinese individuals with CAVD through a cohort analysis and meta-analysis. CFTR was sequenced in 145 Chinese individuals with CAVD. CFTR variants were classified as CF-causing or non-CF-causing variants regarding clinical significance. A comprehensive genotype analysis was performed in Chinese individuals with CAVD, incorporating previous studies and our study cohort. The prevalence of CF-causing variants was estimated through meta-analysis. In our cohort, 56 different CFTR variants were identified in 108 (74.5%) patients. Twenty variants were categorized as CF-causing and were detected in 28 (19.3%) patients. A comprehensive genotype analysis of 867 patients identified 174 different CFTR variants. Sixty-four were classified as CF-causing variants, 56.3% of which had not been previously reported in Chinese patients with CF. Meta-analysis showed that 14.8% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 11.0%-18.9%) CAVD cases harbored one CF-causing variant, and 68.6% (95% CI: 65.1%-72.0%) CAVD cases carried at least one CFTR variant. Our study underscores the urgent need for extensive CFTR screening, including sequencing of whole exons and flanking regions and detection of large rearrangements and deep intronic CF-causing variants, in Chinese individuals with CAVD before undergoing ART. The established CF-causing variants spectrum may aid in the development of genetic counseling strategies and preimplantation diagnosis to prevent the birth of a child with CF."

    "abstract": "Routine screening for nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) lung disease is dependent on sputum cultures. This is particularly challenging in the cystic fibrosis (CF) population due to reduced sputum production and low culture sensitivity. Biomarkers of infection that do not rely on sputum may lead to earlier diagnosis, but validation trials require a unique prospective design. The rationale of this trial is to investigate the utility of urine lipoarabinomannan (LAM) as a test to identify people with CF with a new positive NTM culture. We hypothesize that urine LAM is a sensitive, non-invasive screening test with a high negative predictive value to identify individuals with a relatively low risk of having positive NTM sputum culture. This is a prospective, single-center, non-randomized observational study in adults with CF, 3 years of negative NTM cultures, and no known history of NTM positive cultures. Patients are followed for two year-long observational periods with the primary endpoint being a positive NTM sputum culture within a year of a positive urine LAM result and a secondary endpoint of a positive NTM sputum culture within 3 years of a positive urine LAM result. Study implementation includes remote consent and sample collection to accommodate changes from the COVID-19 pandemic. This report describes the study design of an observational study aimed at using a urine biomarker to assist in the diagnosis of NTM lung infection in pwCF. If successful, urine LAM could be used as an adjunct to traditional sputum cultures for routine NTM screening, and replace cultures in low-risk individuals unable to produce sputum."

    "abstract": "The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a chloride channel whose dysfunction leads to intracellular accumulation of chloride ions, dehydration of cell surfaces, and subsequent damage to airway and ductal organs. Beyond its function as a chloride channel, interactions between CFTR, epithelium sodium channel, and solute carrier (SLC) transporter family membrane proteins and cytoplasmic proteins, including calmodulin and Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor-1 (NHERF-1), coregulate ion homeostasis. CFTR has also been observed to form mesoscale membrane clusters. However, the contributions of multivalent protein and lipid interactions to cluster formation are not well understood. Using a combination of computational modeling and biochemical reconstitution assays, we demonstrate that multivalent interactions with CFTR protein binding partners, calcium, and membrane cholesterol can induce mesoscale CFTR cluster formation on model membranes. Phosphorylation of the intracellular domains of CFTR also promotes mesoscale cluster formation in the absence of calcium, indicating that multiple mechanisms can contribute to CFTR cluster formation. Our findings reveal that coupling of multivalent protein and lipid interactions promotes CFTR cluster formation consistent with membrane-associated biological phase separation."

We have previously shown that sphingosine, which is abundantly present on epithelial cells of the respiratory tract in healthy humans and wild-type mice, but almost undetectable on the surface of epithelial cells of the respiratory tract from CF patients and CF mice, efficiently kills many bacterial species <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. Here, we show that sphingosine very rapidly induces marked changes in the membrane of <i>P. aeruginosa</i> with a rolling of the membrane followed by destruction of the bacteria. Sphingosine induced a degradation of cardiolipin via the maintenance of lipid asymmetry (Mla) system in <i>P. aeruginosa</i>. Degradation of cardiolipin induced by sphingosine is prevented in <i>P. aeruginosa</i> mutants of MlaY and reduced in mutants of MlaZ and MlaA. Mutants of MlaY and MlaZ were resistant to sphingosine-induced death of <i>P. aeruginosa</i>. In summary, our data indicate that sphingosine induces the death of <i>P. aeruginosa</i> by a persisting degradation of cardiolipin by the Mla system leading to severe membrane changes in bacteria, while leaving mammalian cells, devoid of cardiolipin in their plasma membrane, alive."

We aimed to examine anxiety and depression levels of people with CF (pwCF) and their caregivers according to their access to modulator treatment. Participants genetically eligible for elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI) were divided into Group 1 (access via court decision, not yet on treatment) and Group 2 (unable to access due to reimbursement issues). Genetically ineligible participants formed Group 3. All pwCF and parents of those under 18 were screened for depression by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and for anxiety by the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7). Surveys for Group 1 patients were conducted just before starting ETI. Binary logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate the effects of independent variables on anxiety and depression in pwCF and their primary caregivers. A total of 389 pwCF and 285 caregivers were included. Group 3 (ineligible) had the highest depression rate (72.9%, n = 35), while Group 1 (pre-ETI) had the lowest (50.0%, n = 35). Median PHQ-9 scores were significantly lower in Group 1 (p < 0.006). Anxiety rates were higher in Groups 2 and 3 compared to Group 1 (p = 0.011 and p = 0.003, respectively). Access to ETI reduced the odds of anxiety by 67.7% (p = 0.029). Caregiver GAD-7 scores showed a weak negative correlation with pwCF age (r = -0.117). Limited access to modulator therapies is associated with higher depression and anxiety symptoms among pwCF. Addressing these barriers is critical to improving their well-being."

The overuse of conventional treatments like antibiotics has raised concerns about antibiotic resistance and side effects. <i>Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus</i> GG (LGG), one of the most extensively studied probiotics, has gained attention as a potential adjunct therapies due to their ability to modulate the gut microbiota and immune responses. This review aims to assess the effectiveness of LGG in managing pediatric respiratory diseases, including respiratory tract infections (RTI), cystic fibrosis (CF), and asthma. Clinical trials suggest LGG can reduce the incidence and severity of RTI, improving CF symptoms, and enhancing quality of life in children. However, evidence for its benefits in asthma remains inconclusive. Its mechanisms include modulating immune responses, enhancing gut barrier function, and maintaining a microbial homeostasis via the gut-lung axis. Existing studies are often limited by small sample sizes, heterogeneity in intervention protocols, and short follow-up periods. Emerging technologies and novel formulations, hold promise for unraveling the complex interactions among LGG, the gut-lung axis, and respiratory health. These advancements could pave the way for personalized probiotic therapies, highlighting the potential of LGG as a cost-effective, adjunctive therapy for pediatric respiratory diseases. This review underscores the broader significance of integrating LGG into pediatric healthcare, while calling for future research to overcome current limitations, optimize clinical protocols, and explore innovative therapeutic strategies."

This study aimed to describe the clinical, radiological, and microbiological characteristics of Portuguese children with bronchiectasis. Methods A retrospective observational study was conducted at a tertiary pediatric pulmonology center in northern Portugal. Pediatric patients diagnosed with bronchiectasis and followed between July 2020 and September 2023 were included. Results A total of 38 patients were included, of whom 19 (50.0%) were male, with a median age at diagnosis of 6.3 years (3.8-11.0 years). Recurrent wheezing (n = 30, 78.9%) and chronic wet cough (n = 18, 47.4%) were the most common symptoms. An underlying etiology was identified in 36 (94.7%) patients, primarily postinfectious bronchiectasis (n = 18, 47.4%) and primary ciliary dyskinesia (n = 10, 26.3%). Multilobar involvement was observed in 25 (65.8%) patients, most frequently affecting the middle and lower lobes. Spirometry showed a mixed obstructive-restrictive pattern in 10 (33.3%) patients and a predominantly obstructive pattern in nine (30.0%) patients. <i>Haemophilus influenzae</i> and <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i> were the most frequently isolated microorganisms, both in bronchoalveolar lavage and sputum cultures. <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> was detected in nine (7.4%) sputum samples.

The study compared pregnancy outcomes amongst fwCF between pregnancies exposed and unexposed to CFTR modulators. Among 590 pregnancies in fwCF, 148 (24.7 %) were exposed to CFTR modulators, including 136 during first trimester. Of these, 147 (99.3 %) resulted in livebirths. The most common CFTR modulator used was ELX/TEZ/IVA, in 121 (81.8 %) pregnancies. The prevalence of major birth defects was similar between exposed and unexposed fwCF (3.38 % vs. 4.66 %; p = 0.72). The rate of small for gestational age (SGA, <10th percentile) was significantly lower in pregnancies exposed compared to unexposed (6.8 % vs. 16.1 %; p < 0.01). The study provides early reassurance about the safety of CFTR modulators during pregnancy, particularly in terms of teratogenicity and adverse pregnancy outcomes. While findings suggest potential benefits, such as halved rate of SGA, further research is required to confirm these outcomes and investigate long-term effects on the development of children prenatally exposed to CFTR modulators."

    "abstract": "Mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule 1 (MAdCAM-1) expression in high endothelial venules is regulated by bacterial metabolites emanating from the gut and the interaction of MAdCAM-1 with α4β7 integrin mediates lymphocyte diapedesis into gut-associated secondary lymphoid tissues. MAdCAM-1 thus controls the abundance of circulating immunosuppressive T cells that can reach malignant tissue and compromise the therapeutic efficacy of anticancer immunotherapy. Here we describe a biosensor-based phenotypic assessment that facilitates the high throughput screening (HTS)-compatible assessment of MAdCAM-1 regulation in response to exposure to bacterial metabolites. This screening routine encompasses high endothelial venule cells expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the control of the MAdCAM-1 promoter combined with robot-assisted bioimaging and a multistep image analysis pipeline. Altogether this system facilitates the discovery of bacterial composites that control anticancer immunity via the sequestration of Th17-specific regulatory T cells (Treg17) in the gut."

    "abstract": "Survival in cystic fibrosis (CF) is increasing and more women are considering their reproductive options, however there is limited data on pregnancy and neonatal outcomes in this population. The objectives of this study were to describe maternal and neonatal outcomes in women with CF and the general Canadian maternal population (general population). Maternal and neonatal clinical outcomes and healthcare utilization for in-hospital live births was retrieved from the Canadian Institute for Health Information's Discharge Abstract Database. Mothers with CF were identified using the ICD-10-CA code for CF. The observation period was fiscal year (FY) 2006-2007 to FY2020-2021 for mothers with CF, and FY2019-2020 for the general population. During the 15-year observation period, there were 154 newborns from 146 deliveries among 124 mothers with CF. Relative to the general population, mothers with CF were younger (median age 28 vs. 31 years), had more comorbidities, induction of labour, epidural, assisted delivery and use of assisted reproductive technologies, but fewer cesarean sections. Nearly 85% of mothers with CF delivered in a hospital that had a CF clinic. 6.8% of mothers with CF were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Neonates born to mothers with CF had high rates of multiple births, preterm delivery, and jaundice. 26.6% of neonates born to mothers with CF were admitted to the neonatal ICU. While no inferential analyses were done, mothers with CF and their newborns may experience worse post-delivery outcomes and may require greater use of healthcare resources than the general population."

    "abstract": "Chronic respiratory diseases, including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and bronchiectasis, are significant global health concerns associated with recurrent exacerbations, hospitalization, and increased mortality. Preventive strategies, particularly vaccination, play a crucial role in managing these diseases by reducing infection-related exacerbations and stabilizing lung function. This review summarizes the recommendations provided by four major Italian scientific societies on vaccination against key respiratory pathogens, including respiratory syncytial virus, influenza, SARS-CoV-2, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and varicella zoster virus, which pose serious risks to individuals with chronic respiratory conditions. Evidence supporting the role of vaccines in minimizing exacerbations and improving patient outcomes in asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and bronchiectasis is highlighted, alongside recent advancements in vaccine technology and recommendations for high-risk populations. This expert-led, multidisciplinary approach underlines the necessity of targeted immunization strategies to mitigate complications, lower healthcare costs, and enhance the quality of life for patients with respiratory diseases. By collecting the latest evidence-based recommendations, this article aims to guide healthcare providers in adopting optimal vaccination strategies for respiratory disease management and contribute to the broader public health effort to reduce the burden of respiratory infections."

    "abstract": "As the lifespan of people with CF (pwCF) improves, sensitive markers of lung health are needed. Dynamic chest radiography (DCR) is a low ionising radiation dose cineradiographic imaging system that provides real-time information on moving thoracic structures. We examined whether DCR provides quantitative motion analysis that correlates with pulmonary function, anthropometric and clinical variables in pwCF, to explore DCR as a marker of lung health. In this prospective, observational, single-centre, non-controlled study, participantsunderwent DCR and spirometry. We measured DCR parameters such as diaphragm motion and change in projected lung area (ΔPLA). The study is registered on the ISRCTN registry (ID 64994816). Correlation was assessed using Spearman's coefficient, and relationships between DCR and spirometric variables using linear regression modelling. Descriptive statistics are reported as mean ± standard deviation and median (interquartile range) as appropriate. We assessed 129 adult pwCF (age 29[12] years, 48 female, ppFEV1 69±25). Average inspiratory lung area (PLAinsp) was 424±72cm2, and expiratory lung area (PLAexp) 325±68cm2. Left diaphragm motion range was 34±12mm, right 29±12mm. ΔPLA correlated with FEV1 (ρ=0.70,P<0.001). PLAinsp correlated with FVC (ρ=0.56,P<0.001). PLAexp correlated with FEV1/FVC ratio (ρ=-0.49,P<0.001). BMI correlated with ΔPLA (ρ=0.29,P=0.001) and deep breathing hemidiaphragm excursion (right, ρ=0.4,P<0.001; left 0.39,P<0.001). This study is the first to describe diaphragm motion and projected lung areas using DCR in non-exacerbating adult pwCF, and complements work by our group demonstrating change in DCR parameters in pwCF undergoing pharmacological interventions. DCR shows potential as a tool to investigate lung health in pwCF."

    "abstract": "Fatty acids are a primary source of carbon for Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) in the airways of people with cystic fibrosis (CF). Here, we use tandem mass-tag proteomics to analyse the protein expression profile of a CF clinical isolate grown on different fatty acids. Two fatty acyl-CoA dehydrogenases (designated FadE1 and FadE2) are strongly induced during growth on fatty acids. FadE1 displays a strong preference for long-chain acyl-CoAs, whereas FadE2 exclusively utilizes medium-chain acyl-CoAs. Structural analysis of the enzymes enables us to identify residues comprising the substrate selectivity filter in each. Engineering these residues enables us to invert the substrate specificity of each enzyme. Mutants in fadE1 displayed impaired virulence in an infection model, and decreased growth on long chain fatty acids. The unique features of the substrate binding pocket enable us to identify an inhibitor that is differentially active against FadE1 and FadE2."

    "abstract": "Hypermutable P. aeruginosa isolates frequently display resistance emergence during treatment. Mechanisms of such resistance emergence have not been explored using dynamic hollow-fiber studies and multiomics informed mathematical modeling. Two hypermutable and heteroresistant P. aeruginosa isolates, CW8 (MIC<sub>meropenem</sub>=8 mg/L, MIC<sub>tobramycin</sub>=8 mg/L) and CW44 (MIC<sub>meropenem</sub>=4 mg/L, MIC<sub>tobramycin</sub>=2 mg/L), were studied. Both isolates had genotypes resembling those of carbapenem- and aminoglycoside-resistant strains. Achievable lung fluid concentration-time profiles following meropenem at 1 or 2 g every 8 h (3-h infusion) and tobramycin at 5 or 10 mg/kg body weight every 24 h (0.5-h infusion), in monotherapy and combinations, were simulated over 8 days. Total and resistant bacterial counts were determined. Resistant colonies and whole population samples at 191 h were whole-genome sequenced, and population transcriptomics performed at 1 and 191 h. The multiomics analyses informed mechanism-based modeling of total and resistant populations. While both isolates eventually displayed resistance emergence against all regimens, the high-dose combination synergistically suppressed resistant regrowth of only CW8 up to ∼96 h. Mutations that emerged during treatment were in pmrB, ampR, and multiple efflux pump regulators for CW8, and in pmrB and PBP2 for CW44. At 1 h, mexB, oprM and ftsZ were differentially downregulated in CW8 by the combination. These transcriptomics results informed inclusion of mechanistic synergy in the mechanism-based model for only CW8. At 191 h, norspermidine genes were upregulated (without a pmrB mutation) in CW8 by the combination, and informed the adaptive loss of synergy in the model. Multiomics information enabled mechanism-based modeling to describe the bacterial response of both isolates simultaneously. Pseudomonas aeruginosa causes serious bacterial infections in people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF), and has numerous resistance mechanisms. Current empirical approaches to informing antibiotic regimen selection have important limitations. This study exposed two P. aeruginosa clinical isolates to concentration-time profiles of meropenem and tobramycin as would be observed in lung fluid of pwCF. The combination elicited different bacterial count profiles between the isolates, despite similar bacterial baseline characteristics. We found differences between the isolates in the expression of a key resistance mechanism against meropenem at 1 h, and expression that implied a loss of cell membrane permeability for tobramycin without the expected DNA mutation. This information enabled mathematical modeling to accurately describe all bacterial profiles over time. For the first time, this multiomics informed modeling approach using DNA and RNA data was applied to a hollow-fiber infection study. Using bacterial molecular insights with mechanism-based mathematical modeling has high potential for ultimately informing personalised antibiotic therapy."

These models could assist with the study of the pathophysiology of NTM-PD as well as the preclinical development of new therapies. In the present study, an immunocompetent rat model of progressive Mycobacterium abscessus (MABs)- PD was developed using MABs originating from a patient with cystic fibrosis. MABs was embedded in agarose beads and delivered intratracheally to the lungs of Sprague Dawley rats two times at a one-week time interval. The bacterial burden of lysed lungs, spleen and liver was assessed by calculating colony forming units (CFUs) on day 28. Lung CFUs indicated a ∼1.2-2 log<sub>10</sub> total CFU increase compared to the initial total bacterial load instilled into the lungs. In all infected rats, multinodular granulomatous inflammatory lesions containing MABs were found in the lung. These findings support the establishment of an immunocompetent MABs PD rat model, characterised by an increase in mycobacterial burden over time and a chronic granulomatous inflammatory response to the MABs infection."

    "abstract": "Cyclic diguanylate (c-di-GMP) is a central biofilm regulator in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, where increased intracellular levels promote biofilm formation and antibiotic tolerance. Targeting the c-di-GMP network may be a promising anti-biofilm approach, but most strategies studied so far aimed at eliminating surface-attached biofilms, while in vivo P. aeruginosa biofilms often occur as suspended aggregates. Here, the expression profile of c-di-GMP metabolism-related genes was analysed among 32 P. aeruginosa strains grown as aggregates in synthetic cystic fibrosis sputum. The diguanylate cyclase SiaD proved essential for auto-aggregation under in vivo-like conditions. Virtual screening predicted a high binding affinity of echinacoside towards the active site of SiaD. Echinacoside reduced c-di-GMP levels and aggregate sizes and potentiated tobramycin activity against aggregates in >80% of strains tested. This synergism was also observed in P. aeruginosa-infected 3-D alveolar epithelial cells and murine lungs, demonstrating echinacoside's potential as an adjunctive therapy for recalcitrant P. aeruginosa infections."

    "abstract": "Cystic fibrosis is caused by biallelic mutations in the gene encoding the CFTR conductor channel. The recent approval of the Elexacaftor-Tezacaftor-Ivacaftor (ETI) therapy has marked a milestone in the management of this disease, alleviating respiratory and digestive symptoms. However, this treatment has no impact on the increased susceptibility to bacterial infections. In this scenario, phage therapy, viruses capable of selectively targeting and killing bacteria, is an emerging option. In the exploration of phages as therapeutic agents, a crucial consideration is their interaction with host cells, especially the immune system. In a previous study, we established the anti-inflammatory effect of four selected phages using the cftr loss-of-function (LoF) zebrafish embryos. In this study, we dissected the interactions of one of them, i.e. the phage DEV, with two cell types crucial in the context of cystic fibrosis: bronchial epithelial cells carrying biallelic CFTR F508del mutation (CuFi-1) and macrophages chemically CFTR inhibited. DEV administration to both human cell types showed anti-inflammatory effects by decreasing the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. We further demonstrated that, when in contact with CuFi-1 cells, DEV is internalized and degraded through the lysosomal compartment. In zebrafish, we showed that DEV interacts with tissue-resident macrophages and, in turn, reduces neutrophil recruitment toward the inflammation site. This information sheds light on a previously undocumented aspect of phage therapy as a modulator of the immune response, inducing anti-inflammatory effects. This could be particularly noteworthy within the context of excessive inflammation observed in the airways of individuals with cystic fibrosis."

    "abstract": "Nonsense mutations in the CFTR gene are responsible for approximately 8 % of cystic fibrosis (CF) cases worldwide. The consequent premature termination of translation leads to the production of a truncated and non-functional CFTR protein. Despite the intensive research in the field, these patients cannot benefit from specific and approved therapies yet. To address this issue, in this study we evaluated a potential therapeutic strategy to overcome the nonsense G542X (UGG > UGA) mutation in the CFF-16HBEge human bronchial epithelial cells by restoring the full-length CFTR protein. We applied the RESTORE (Recruiting endogenous ADAR to specific transcripts for oligonucleotide-mediated RNA editing) approach, based on specifically designed antisense RNA oligonucleotides (ASOs) to recruit endogenous ADAR (adenosine deaminase acting on RNA) enzymes. The ADAR's recruitment to the target CFTR mRNA is expected to promote the deamination of adenosine (A) into inosine (I) within the premature termination codon (UGA). As the ribosome reads the inosine as guanosine (G), the stop codon could be recoded as a tryptophan (UGG), thereby allowing the synthesis of a full-length CFTR protein, albeit with a different amino acid. Our results indicate that in the CFF-16HBEge G542X cell line, the transfection of a specific ASO allows the rescue of the CFTR transcript and protein expression, compared to the untransfected mutated cells. Next generation sequencing of CFTR cDNA also confirmed the occurrence of the expected RNA editing outcome. The obtained results suggest that the RESTORE approach might be explored as a promising strategy to treating nonsense mutations in CFTR, potentially contributing to novel therapeutic options for CF patients."

Although it is one of the most common chILDs, no unified diagnostic approach specific to this condition exists. Are the clinical presentation and the diagnostic approach different in patients with PTI/NEHI among European countries? This was a European multicenter, retrospective, observational study. Data on clinical characteristics and diagnostic strategies in patients with PTI/NEHI were analyzed and compared across participating countries. The study included 378 children with PTI/NEHI from 17 countries (63.5% male, 97.4% White) who received a diagnosis at a median age of 9 months (interquartile range, 6-13 months). The most common baseline symptoms were tachypnea, chest retractions, crackles on auscultation, hypoxemia, and failure to thrive. High-resolution CT (HRCT) imaging was performed in all patients, with most undergoing chest radiography, echocardiography, and immunology tests. Lung biopsy was carried out in 23.5% of patients, with a decreasing trend over time and variation by country; its use was associated with longer diagnostic delay. Histopathologic examination showed a hyperplasia of pulmonary neuroendocrine cells in 52.8% of patients. Genetic testing was rare, and its application varied significantly among countries. Additional investigations that do not have an established role, such as assessment for gastroesophageal reflux disease and OSA, infant pulmonary function tests, and lung ultrasound, were limited to single countries. Diagnosis of PTI/NEHI relies on clinical symptoms and HRCT imaging results, with lung biopsies less commonly performed. Differences exist among countries regarding the number and type of investigations. A need exists for guidelines that will standardize the diagnostic approach."

As technology advances, there is the potential to expand the newborn screening program following evaluation of the likely benefits and drawbacks. To inform these decisions, it is important to consider the family experience of screening and the views of the public. Engaging in public dialogue can be difficult. The conditions, screening processes, and associated moral and ethical considerations are complex. This study aims to develop a stand-alone online resource to enable a range of stakeholders to understand whether and how next-generation sequencing should be incorporated into the CF screening algorithm. Around 4 development workshops with policymakers, parents, and other stakeholders informed the design of an interactive activity, including the structure, content, and questions posed. Stakeholders were recruited to take part in the development workshops via purposeful and snowball sampling methods to achieve a diversity of views across roles and organizations, with email invitations sent to representative individuals with lived, clinical, and academic experience related to CF and screening. Ten stakeholders informed the development process including those with lived experience of CF (2/10, 20%), clinicians (2/10, 20%), and representatives from relevant government, charity, and research organizations (6/10, 60%). Vignettes constructed using interview data and translated into scripts were recorded to provide short films to represent and provoke consideration of families' experiences. Participants were recruited (n=6, adults older than 18 years) to test the resulting resource. Study advertisements were circulated via physical posters and digital newsletters to recruit participants who self-identified as having a reading difficulty or having English as a second language. An open access online resource, \"Cystic Fibrosis Newborn Screening: You Decide,\" was developed and usability and acceptability tested to provide the \"user\" (eg, a parent, the general public, or a health care professional) with an interactive scenario-based presentation of the potential outcomes of extended genetic testing, allowing them to visualize the impact on families. This included a learning workbook that explains key concepts and processes. The resulting tool facilitates public engagement with and understanding of complex genetic and screening concepts. Online resources such as the one developed during this work have the potential to help people form considered views and facilitate access to the perspectives of parents and the wider public on genetic testing.

This article will provide an overview of the physiologic and psychosocial challenges toward attaining optimal nutrition in pediatric cystic fibrosis patients. Newer therapies such as CFTR modulators have played significant roles in improving the nutritional status of patients with cystic fibrosis. There is also a greater focus on becoming more aware of psychosocial and cultural barriers in the care of cystic fibrosis patients. Many challenges exist in optimizing nutritional support including but not limited to the patient's clinical manifestations and disease severity, caregiver ability, and access to care. Both gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal disorders lead to insufficient caloric intake, increased loss and metabolic needs, and micronutrient and macronutrient deficiency.

Tuft cell deletion was induced in DCLK1-IRES-GFP-CreERT2/+;Rosa-DTA (DCLK1-DTA) mice by a single tamoxifen injection, concomitant with littermate controls. Transient deletion of intestinal and biliary tuft cells was maximal on day 4 and recovered by day 7 post tamoxifen. DCLK1-DTA mice presented with significantly shortened small intestinal length and greater body weight loss by day 4. The activity of Na<sup>+</sup>-dependent glucose transporter 1 (SGLT1) and cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) was reduced. Correlated with tuft cell reduction, the frequency of cholecystokinin (CCK)<sup>+</sup> enteroendocrine and intermediate secretory cells, which co-express Paneth and goblet cell markers, was increased. In the lamina propria, fewer mast cells and leukocytes were found in the Day 4 DCLK1-DTA mice compared to controls. Ablation of tuft cells may induce nutrient malabsorption through alterations in epithelial cell proliferation and differentiation, along with changes in the mucosal defense response. These observations identify a new role for tuft cells in regulating intestinal absorption and mucosal regeneration."

A national descriptive study based on a survey questionnaire was conducted. The questionnaire consisted of three different sections: distribution and characteristics of the centres, services provided by respiratory therapists, physiotherapists' perception of the unit. The survey was distributed to all healthcare providers via an online platform, and a descriptive data analysis was performed. The survey had a response rate of 97.5% with twenty-nine responses collected. The centers are heterogeneously distributed: thirteen in the northern regions, eight in the central regions and eight in the southern regions. Of the 29 centers with a physiotherapy unit, 19 had a specialized respiratory therapy unit. Respiratory therapy was provided in different care settings: regular wards (28/29 centers, 97%), outpatient service (29/29 centers, 100%), and intensive or semi-intensive care units (17/29 centers, 59%). The interventions provided by respiratory therapists involved more than just airway clearance (29/29). More specific interventions, such as pulmonary function tests (23/29), functional tests (27/29), educational training (26/29), management of workout exercise programs (25/29) and interventions developed in collaboration with physicians such as non-invasive ventilation (NIV) (23/29) and oxygen titration (21/29) are performed. It is interesting to note that therapists are also involved in various activities, such as telemedicine, physiotherapists' research projects, and supporting alongside physicians, for the prescription at home of medical devices. Perception of the unit was also evaluated. The involved centers are heterogeneous in terms of distribution and treatments offered. The role of respiratory physiotherapists still seems to be fragmented. This first descriptive analysis of the physiotherapy units and the main differences between centers opens queries on the clinical approaches used for pediatric patients with PCD in terms of respiratory physiotherapy. However,in response to evolving treatment needs, a more specialized and standardized approach to patient care is required."

    "abstract": "<i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> (<i>P. aeruginosa</i>) is a pathogen commonly associated with lung infections in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, often developing a mucoid phenotype that overproduces alginate, a major component of the biofilm's extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) matrix, increasing tolerance to antibiotics. Past studies have shown that low-frequency ultrasound (LFU) increases the antibiotic susceptibility of <i>P. aeruginosa</i> in biofilms, but its effects on mucoid strains are unknown. In this study, we assessed the combined application of LFU and antibiotics on <i>P. aeruginosa</i> FRD1, a mucoid strain, and compared it to nonmucoid <i>P. aeruginosa</i> PAO1 biofilms. The mucoid biofilm exhibited greater stiffness, thickness, and density, with polysaccharides (likely alginate) comprising over 70% of the EPS matrix. Although LFU application led to a 50% increase in biofilm creep compliance, no synergistic effect was observed with tobramycin. However, the same LFU treatment significantly improved ciprofloxacin susceptibility. We implemented a one-dimensional model that estimated a 25-fold increase in the diffusion coefficient for ciprofloxacin following LFU, though higher intensities were needed to induce comparable effects in diffusivity and mechanical properties compared to the nonmucoid biofilm. The model also suggested that tobramycin likely sorbed to alginate, hindering diffusion to the biofilm interior, thereby reducing its inactivation efficiency. Our findings suggest that LFU can impact antibiotic diffusion through the biofilm and mechanical properties but not necessarily overcome antibiotic interactions with the EPS matrix. Additionally, variations in EPS matrix composition may require different LFU intensities for effective outcomes. These results may have significant implications for potential clinical applications, especially for CF patients."

    "abstract": "Inflammatory lung diseases (ILDs) such as asthma, acute respiratory distress syndrome, bronchiectasis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COVID-19, cystic fibrosis, and lung cancer impose a substantial worldwide healthcare impact. The pathophysiology of these disorders is primarily influenced by the involvement of neutrophils, which are crucial triggers in the natural immune reaction. Neutrophils participate in pulmonary inflammation and tissue destruction. When neutrophils are activated and recruited, they migrate to inflammatory lung tissues via the chemokine receptor CXCR2. This study explores how neutrophils, directed by CXCR2 signaling, participate in the inflammatory environment in the lung, inducing tissue injury and the development of illness. We investigate both the functional and structural features of CXCR2, emphasizing its relationship with ligands such as IL-8 (CXCL8) and GRO-α (CXCL1) and its involvement in ILDs. The article also explores novel treatment approaches that focus on CXCR2, such as the use of small molecule antagonists. These compounds can regulate neutrophil behavior and reduce signs of the illness. The study provides a detailed analysis of current clinical studies and the results of inhibiting CXCR2, specifically looking at the effectiveness and safety of these new medicines. This study seeks to deliver a thorough analysis of the important function of neutrophils and CXCR2 in ILDs, as well as the possibility of CXCR2-targeted therapeutics to enhance clinical outcomes."

Such experiments are frequently used to evaluate the activity of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a cAMP-activated chloride channel that is defective in cystic fibrosis, one of the most frequent genetic diseases. Typically, CFTR activity is estimated from the effect of CFTR<sub>inh</sub>-172, a selective CFTR inhibitor. Unexpectedly, we found that CFTR<sub>inh</sub>-172, in addition to PPQ-102, another CFTR inhibitor, caused only partial inhibition of CFTR function, particularly in epithelia in pro-inflammatory conditions, which are characterized by abundant mucus secretion. We hypothesized that the mucus layer was responsible for the poor activity of CFTR inhibitors. Therefore, we treated the epithelial surface with the reducing agent dithiothreitol to remove mucus. Removal of mucus, confirmed by immunofluorescence, resulted in highly enhanced sensitivity of CFTR to pharmacological inhibition. Our results show that the mucus layer represents an important barrier whose presence limits the activity of pharmacological agents. This is particularly relevant for CFTR and the evaluation of therapeutic approaches for correction of the basic defect in cystic fibrosis. KEY POINTS: Activity of the cAMP-activated cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) chloride channel can be evaluated by measuring the inhibition elicited by the selective blockers CFTR<sub>inh</sub>-172 and PPQ-102. In short-circuit current recordings on human airway epithelia, CFTR inhibitors had only a partial effect on cAMP-dependent chloride secretion, suggesting the possible contribution of other ion channels. The mucus layer covering the epithelial surface was removed with the reducing agent dithiothreitol. Treatment of epithelia with dithiothreitol markedly improved the efficacy of CFTR inhibitors. The partial effect of CFTR inhibitors might be explained by the presence of the mucus layer acting as a barrier."

    "title": "Intestinal luminal anion transporters and their interplay with gut microbiome and inflammation.",
    "abstract": "The intestine, as a critical interface between the external environment and the internal body, plays a central role in nutrient absorption, immune regulation, and maintaining homeostasis. The intestinal epithelium, composed of specialized epithelial cells, harbors apical anion transporters that primarily mediate the transport of chloride and bicarbonate ions, essential for maintaining electrolyte balance, pH homeostasis, and fluid absorption/secretion. In addition, the intestine hosts a diverse population of gut microbiota that plays a pivotal role in various physiological processes including nutrient metabolism, immune regulation, and maintenance of intestinal barrier integrity, all of which are critical for host gut homeostasis and health. The anion transporters and gut microbiome are intricately interconnected, where alterations in one can trigger changes in the other, leading to compromised barrier integrity and increasing susceptibility to pathophysiological states including gut inflammation. This review focuses on the interplay of key apical anion transporters including Down-Regulated in Adenoma (DRA, SLC26A3), Putative Anion Transporter-1 (PAT1, SLC26A6), and Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator [CFTR, ATP-binding cassette subfamily C member 7 (ABCC7)] with the gut microbiome, barrier integrity, and their relationship to gut inflammation."

    "title": "The Additional Use of Spirometry in Evaluating Chronic Cough in Children. \"May the Force Be With You\".",
    "abstract": "Spirometry is the most common and straightforward examination following the mandatory initial steps of personal history and physical examination when assessing chronic and/or recurrent lung symptoms in children, especially cough or specific conditions that can impact lung function. When dealing with a chronic cough (lasting more than four weeks), it is not uncommon to find that no specific clues regarding the cause of the cough can be deduced from the patient's history alone. Moreover, clinical examinations can be quite normal without any abnormal lung sounds. In the next step (spirometry), surprisingly, as the child forcefully expels the air from the lungs, you can hear secretions moving along the bronchi as the rapidly moving air drifts excessive sputum to the upper airways. Less commonly, forceful exhalation during spirometry may uncover a brassy or honking sound, indicating potential collapsibility of the tracheal walls. Secretions in the bronchi can imply specific conditions, such as protracted bacterial bronchitis or suppurative bronchitis. Additionally, forced exhalation may uncover sputum in other chronic lung conditions, such as cystic fibrosis or primary cilia dyskinesia. The presence of tracheomalacia is an important parameter, as it can precipitate several respiratory symptoms, ranging from prolonged cough in acute bronchitis to recurrent and/or chronic wet cough. In conclusion, forceful exhalation during spirometry has the potential to uncover secretions in the bronchi or even tracheomalacia that might otherwise go unnoticed. Before watching the flow-volume loop or interpreting the results of the spirometry parameters, we should first \"hear\" the spirometry."

    "abstract": "Rising antibiotic resistance among bacterial pathogens has become a substantial health issue for human civilization. The emergence of these pathogens in high-risk diseases such as cystic fibrosis (CF) has led to financial and nonfinancial losses, necessitating alternative therapies. This study presents an overview of such approaches, including phage therapy, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), nanotechnology, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), microbial therapies (probiotic therapy), clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats technology (CRISPR), and aptamers focusing on their mechanisms of action and exploring the impact of combining phage and phage derivatives with the mentioned approaches. Although alternative approaches and their combinations with phages show promise, the phage-antibiotic combination has been the subject of most studies, and It has been proven to be highly effective in combating antibiotic-resistant infections. Other combinations also appear promising, but further studies are needed to determine their effectiveness. This emphasizes the need for more thorough research into different phage combination treatments beyond the well-established phage-antibiotic strategy."

    "abstract": "Although cystic fibrosis (CF) mainly affects the respiratory and gastrointestinal systems, it may frequently present with musculoskeletal manifestations including bone fractures, low bone mineral density, and spinal pathologies. Assessment of spinal pathologies in CF patients is of vital importance because the effects on lung capacity and spinal posture are clearly defined. The frequency of vertebral pathologies in CF patients has yet to be determined. The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency of scoliosis and hyperkyphosis and the relationship of coronal, sagittal, and spinopelvic parameters with disease severity in CF patients. Patients were tested with forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), and full spine radiographs. Measurements were taken of the major coronal curve in the coronal plane, cervical and lumber lordosis, thoracic kyphosis, and C7 plumb line values. Patients were categorized into 3 groups based on the FEV1 values (severity) from respiratory function tests (severe: group 1 FEV 1≤40, moderate: group 2 FEV1 40 to 80, mild: group). This cross-sectional study included 208 CF patients aged 5 to 21 years. The rates of scoliosis and thoracic hyperkyphosis were 31% (n=64) and 24% (n=50), respectively. The highest rates of scoliosis (63%) and thoracic hyperkyphosis (56%) were found in the severe CF group ( P =0.016 and P =0.006, respectively). FEV1 and thoracic kyphosis were weakly and inversely but significantly correlated (rho: -0.200 and P =0.004). There was no difference in BMD between patients with and without scoliosis and between patients with and without hyperkyphosis. There was no significant difference in DEXA Z-score between patients with and without hyperkyphosis. The L1-L4 DEXA Z-score of patients without scoliosis was significantly higher ( P =0.017). Scoliosis and hyperkyphosis were more prevalent in the severe CF patients group, although the proportion of patients requiring treatment was relatively low. Understanding the relationship between disease severity and coronal and sagittal spinal balance, and spinopelvic parameters is crucial, as it guides the early detection and management of scoliosis in CF patients.

Previous studies have profiled somatic mutations in PAAD. In contrast, the prevalence of mutations in PAAD predisposition genes has not been defined, especially in the Asian population. Using a multi-tier cohort design and whole genome/exome sequencing, we create a comprehensive germline mutation map of PAAD in 1,123 Chinese cancer patients in comparison with 11 pan-ethnic studies. For well-known pathogenic/likely pathogenic germline variants, Chinese patients exhibit overlapping but distinct germline mutation patterns comparing with Western cohorts, highlighted by lower mutation rates in known PAAD genes including BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, CDKN2A, and CHEK2, and distinct mutations in CFTR, RAD51D, FANCA, ERCC2, and GNAS exclusive to Chinese patients. CFTR emerges as a top candidate gene following loss of heterozygosity analysis. Using an integrative multi-omics and functional validation paradigm, we discover that deleterious variants of uncertain significance may compromise CFTR's tumor suppressor function, and demonstrate the clinical relevance by using patient derived organoids for drug screen. Our multifaceted approach not only deepens the knowledge of population differences in PAAD germline mutations but also unveils potential avenues for targeted therapeutic interventions."

    "abstract": "Lipoplexes are non-viral lipid vectors that effectively form complexes with genetic material, positioning them as promising alternatives to viral vectors in gene therapy. Their advantages include lower toxicity, reduced immunogenicity, improved targetability, and ease of large-scale production. A typical lipoplex is composed of cationic lipids, neutral lipids, and anionic nucleic acids (e.g., DNA, mRNA, miRNA, siRNA, shRNA). Neutral lipids play an auxiliary role and are often used as transfection enhancers. Enhancing lipoplex efficiency often involves modifying the cationic lipid structure through functional groups like PEG polymers and targeting ligands. The assembly of lipoplexes occurs spontaneously. This process involves the binding of the positively charged polar head group of the cationic lipid to the negatively charged DNA spontaneously as a result of electrostatic interaction, then irreversible rearrangement and condensation of the lipoplex occurs to form either lamellar or hexagonal structures. The transfection process encompasses several steps: cellular entry, endosomal escape and cargo release, cytoplasmic trafficking, and nuclear entry. The physicochemical and biological properties of lipoplexes are influenced by factors such as lipid structure, charge ratio, and environmental conditions. Despite certain limitations like low gene transfer efficiency and rapid clearance by serum proteins, lipoplexes show promise for clinical applications. They can be administered through various routes, offering potential treatments for diseases such as cancer, bone damage, infection, and cystic fibrosis. The study aims to examine the potential of lipoplexes as a promising vehicle for delivering therapeutic agents and their progression from theoretical concepts to practical clinical applications."

Given the subjective nature of PEx diagnosis and management, we sought to characterize provider PEx management practices in people with CF (pwCF) prescribed highly effective modulator therapy (HEMT) and to identify practice changes that may impact clinical outcomes. We conducted semi-structured qualitative interviews amongst clinicians in the United States (US) in late 2021 to 2022 to investigate changes in the management of PEx in pwCF prescribed ETI. Inductive coding of transcripts was utilized in a thematic analysis. We conducted 19 qualitative interviews with providers at 15 CF centers. Thematic analysis identified five themes regarding the presentation, diagnosis, and management of PEx in pwCF prescribed ETI: (1) PEx have changed in the era of HEMT to become a more subtle pathology that may result in providers questioning PEx diagnosis; (2) providers feel less anxious about clinical outcomes after PEx; (3) providers are expanding their assessment of PEx in the era of HEMT to identify more subtle PEx phenotypes; (4) pwCF are driving their care during PEx more than in the pre-HEMT era, with interviewees reporting that some \"patients don't really contact us [with mild PEx symptoms]…we hear about it in retrospect.\" Interviewees expressed concern that this may result in more severe PEx; (5) provider management is less aggressive in the post-HEMT era, reflecting reduced PEx severity. Participants emphasized that their approach to PEx in general is unchanged and that \"[providers] treat depending on severity…and the background of the patient.\" Interviewees reported they increasingly recommend maintenance therapies for PEx treatment before prescribing antibiotics. Participants report that PEx in pwCF prescribed ETI appear milder, resulting in less anxiety about outcomes and a more conservative approach to management. Providers express uncertainty regarding the diagnosis of PEx given its evolving presentation and reduced in-person evaluation. Further research is necessary to identify sensitive markers of PEx and to assess the impact of conservative management on clinical outcomes."

    "abstract": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (<i>CFTR</i>) gene, resulting in CFTR protein dysfunction. CFTR dysfunction has multi-organ consequences, leading to dehydrated mucus that is adherent to epithelia. In the lungs, this leads to recalcitrant infections with bacteria such as <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>. In the gut, mucus-laden feces can adhere to the intestines, resulting in distal intestinal obstruction syndrome (DIOS). There is limited information on how lung colonization and DIOS are correlated in people with CF (pwCF). In this novel work, we describe the development of spontaneous lung colonization of CF pathogens in young (<3 months old) CF rats, preceding the development of DIOS. Once DIOS is established, the lung microbiome becomes predominated by taxa also observed in the feces. Induced infection with <i>P. aeruginosa</i> in the CF rats reflects data found in pwCF, as once CF rats are infected, they retain a higher relative abundance of <i>P. aeruginosa</i> than their healthy agemates. Finally, we found that ivacaftor treatment favors a healthier gut microbiome in CF rats, decreasing the relative abundance of <i>Escherichia coli</i>. These results indicate that the CF rat model is recapitulative of human CF disease with the spontaneous lung colonization of traditional CF pathogens and maintenance of <i>P. aeruginosa</i> after induced infection. Furthermore, these results indicate a possible role for the gut-lung axis in lung colonization and DIOS in CF.IMPORTANCEThese data describe for the first time the development of spontaneous lung colonization in the cystic fibrosis (CF) rat model, a hallmark aspect of human CF disease. We also find that CF rats infected with <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> maintain higher relative abundance following chronic infection as compared to healthy rats, similar to those is seen in people with CF. Additionally, we describe the possible contribution of the gut-lung axis linking lung health with distal intestinal obstruction syndrome, a relationship largely unexplored in the context of CF."

To compare the magnitude and duration of intended (respiratory) and unintended (fecal) antimicrobial action by analyzing oropharyngeal (OP) and fecal microbiota in IWCF. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing and qPCR were performed on OP and fecal samples collected longitudinally from 14 IWCF (ages 1-17 months) during (\"On Antibiotics\") and after (\"Off Antibiotics\") β-lactam therapy, and from 5 IWCF (3-16 months) never treated with antibiotics. Total bacterial loads (TBL) for On Antibiotics samples were lower than for both Never (OP and fecal) and Off Antibiotics samples (fecal only). α-diversities (within-sample) for OP On Antibiotics samples were lower than for Never and Off Antibiotics samples but did not differ between fecal sample groups. β-diversity (between-sample) differed between all OP sample groups and between fecal On and Never Antibiotics and Off and Never antibiotics samples; however, fecal On and Off Antibiotics sample β-diversities did not differ. Patterns of change in antibiotic resistance gene abundances reflected shifts in microbial community composition. β-lactam antibiotic exposure was followed by marked alterations in both OP and fecal microbiota. While microbiota appeared to rebound after treatment in both sample types, our results suggest that fecal microbiota recovered less than OP. The clinical consequences of these findings should be studied in IWCF and other populations frequently treated with antibiotics."

    "abstract": "Bronchiectasis, a chronic suppurative lung condition, is a largely neglected disease, especially in low- to middle-income countries (LMICs), from which there is a paucity of data. Post-infectious causes are more common in LMICs, while in high-income countries, inborn errors of immunity (IEIs), recurrent aspiration, primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) and cystic fibrosis are more common. Children living with HIV (CLWH), especially those who are untreated, are at increased risk of bronchiectasis. Data on risk factors, diagnosis and follow-up of children with bronchiectasis are required to inform clinical practice and policy. To describe the demographics, medical history, aetiology, clinical characteristics and results of special investigations in children with bronchiectasis. We undertook a retrospective descriptive study of children aged <16 years with chest computed tomography (CT) scan-confirmed bronchiectasis in Johannesburg, South Africa, over a 10-year period. Demographics, medical history, aetiology, clinical characteristics and results of special investigations were described and compared according to HIV status. A total of 91 participants (51% male, 98% black African) with a median (interquartile range) age of 7 (3 - 12) years were included in the study. Compared with HIV-uninfected children, CLWH were older at presentation (median 10 (6 - 13) years v. 4 (3 - 9) years; p<0.01), and more likely to be stunted (p<.01), to have clubbing (p<0.01) and hepatosplenomegaly (p=0.03), and to have multilobar involvement on the chest CT scan (p<0.01). All children had a cause identified, and the majority (86%) of these were presumed to be post-infectious, based on a previous history of a severe lower respiratory tract infection. This group included all 38 CLWH. Only a small proportion of the participants had IEIs, secondary immune deficiencies or PCD. A post-infectious cause for bronchiectasis was the most common aetiology described in children from an LMIC in Africa, especially CLWH. With improved access to diagnostic techniques, the aetiology of bronchiectasis in LMICs is likely to change. <b>What the study adds.</b> In this retrospective descriptive study of children aged <16 years with chest computed tomography scan-confirmed bronchiectasis in Johannesburg, South Africa (SA), over a 10-year period, we report that a post-infectious cause for bronchiectasis was the most commonly described, and that HIV was an important contributor. A large proportion of children with bronchiectasis in low- and middle-income countries such as SA do not benefit from an extensive work-up for the non-infectious causes of bronchiectasis.<b>Implications of the findings.</b> With improved access to diagnostic techniques, including improvements in early diagnosis and access to treatment for children living with HIV, the aetiology of bronchiectasis is likely to change in the coming years."

About 80% of individuals with CF have the p.Phe508del variant that causes the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein to misfold and be targeted for premature degradation by the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) quality control (ERQC), thus preventing its plasma membrane (PM) traffic. Despite the recent approval of a \"highly effective\" drug rescuing p.Phe508del-CFTR, maximal lung function improvement is ∼14%.

This primary screen identified 227 p.Phe508del-CFTR traffic regulators, of which 35 could be validated by additional siRNAs.

Plasmids, which might carry resistance and virulence factors, remain largely unexplored in NTM. We used publicly available complete genome sequence data of 328 NTM isolates belonging to 125 species to study gene content, genomic diversity, and clusters of 196 annotated NTM plasmids. Furthermore, we analyzed 3755 draft genome assemblies from over 200 NTM species and 5415 short-read sequence datasets from six clinically relevant NTM species or complexes including M. abscessus, M. avium complex, M. ulcerans complex and M. kansasii complex, for the presence of these plasmids. Between one and five plasmids were present in approximately one-third of the complete NTM genomes. The annotated plasmids varied widely in length (most between 10 and 400 kbp) and gene content, with many genes having an unknown function. Predicted gene functions primarily involved plasmid replication, segregation, maintenance, and mobility. Only a few plasmids contained predicted genes that are known to confer resistance to antibiotics commonly used to treat NTM infections. Out of 196 annotated plasmid sequences, 116 could be grouped into 31 clusters of closely related sequences, and about one-third were found across multiple NTM species. Among clinically relevant NTM, the presence of NTM plasmids showed significant variation between species, within (sub)species, and even among strains within (sub)lineages, such as dominant circulating clones of Mycobacterium abscessus. Our analysis demonstrates that plasmids are a diverse and heterogeneously distributed feature in NTM bacteria. The frequent occurrence of closely related putative plasmid sequences across different NTM species suggests they may play a significant role in NTM evolution through horizontal gene transfer at least in some groups of NTM. However, further in vitro investigations and access to more complete genomes are necessary to validate our findings, elucidate gene functions, identify novel plasmids, and comprehensively assess the role of plasmids in NTM."

    "title": "Chloride channels and mast cell function: pioneering new frontiers in IBD therapy.",
    "abstract": "Emerging evidence indicates that chloride channels (ClCs) significantly affect the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) through their regulatory roles in mast cell function and epithelial integrity. IBD, encompassing conditions such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, involves chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, where channels influence immune responses, fluid balance, and cellular signalling pathways essential for maintaining mucosal homeostasis. This review examines the specific roles of ClC in mast cells, focussing on the regulation of mast cell activation, degranulation, cytokine release, and immune cell recruitment in inflamed tissues. Key channels, including Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) and ClC-2, are discussed in detail because of their involvement in maintaining intestinal epithelial barrier function, a critical factor disrupted in IBD. For example, CFTR facilitates chloride ion transport across epithelial cells, which is essential for mucosal hydration and maintenance of the intestinal barrier. Reduced CFTR function can compromise this barrier, permitting microbial antigens to penetrate the underlying tissues and triggering excessive immune responses. ClC-2, another chloride channel expressed in mast cells and epithelial cells, supports tight junction integrity, contributes to barrier function, and reduces intestinal permeability. Dysregulation of these channels is linked to altered mast cell activity and excessive release of pro-inflammatory mediators, exacerbating IBD symptoms, such as diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tissue damage. Here, we review recent pharmacological strategies targeting ClC, including CFTR potentiators and ClC-2 activators, which show the potential to mitigate inflammatory responses. Additionally, experimental approaches for selective modulation of chloride channels in mast cells have been explored. Although targeting ClC offers promising therapeutic avenues, challenges remain in achieving specificity and minimizing side effects. This review highlights the therapeutic potential of Cl channel modulation in mast cells as a novel approach for IBD treatment, aiming to reduce inflammation and restore intestinal homeostasis in affected patients."

This retrospective study utilized data from the TriNetX research network, analysing patients with bronchiectasis categorized by the presence or absence of AMR. Primary outcomes included the risk of MACE (myocardial infarction, stroke and systemic thromboembolism, and cardiac arrest) and all-cause death. Cox regression analysis with 1:1 propensity score matching (PSM) was applied to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the primary outcomes. Subgroup analyses were conducted to validate results in clinically relevant subgroups. Prior to PSM, patients with AMR (n=6,543, 61.0±22.0 years, 55.8% female) were younger, more often male, and presented a higher prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors than those without AMR (n=154,685, 67.3±16.0 years, 59.4% female). After PSM, no significant differences were found between groups. However, AMR patients showed a higher risk of MACE (HR 1.29, 95% CI 1.17-1.41) and all-cause death (HR 1.49, 95% CI 1.38-1.61) compared to non-AMR patients. The MACE risk was notably elevated among AMR patients without prior cardiovascular events (HR 1.56, 95% CI 1.34-1.81). Similar MACE risks were observed in cystic fibrosis (HR 1.24, 95% CI 0.86-1.78) and non-cystic fibrosis subgroups (HR 1.28, 95% CI 1.16-1.41), with consistent findings across different AMR types.

Magnetic resonance extracellular volume quantification (MRI ECV) in the liver may have diagnostic utility in CFLD as a more selective liver volume is assessed and can be performed using equipment readily available in clinical practice on a standard MRI protocol. Healthy volunteers (HV), CF participants with no liver disease (CF-noLD) and CF participants with cirrhosis (CF-C) aged 18 years and above had MRI ECV measured using a 3T Siemens scanner. An additional retrospective analysis was performed to calculate MRI ECV in individuals who had available images obtained using a 1.5T Siemens scanner from a previous study. 16 individuals had MRI ECV measured using a 3T Siemens scanner. Mean (SD) MRI ECV was 0.316 (0.058) for HV (n = 5), 0.297 (0.034) for CF-noLD (n = 5) and 0.388 (0.067) for CF-C (n = 6 ).

    "abstract": "Quorum sensing (QS) plays a crucial role in regulating key traits, including the upregulation of phage receptors, which leads to heightened phage susceptibility in <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>. As a result, higher cell densities typically increase the risk of phage invasions. This has led to speculation that bacteria may have evolved strategies to counterbalance this increased susceptibility. Additionally, non-synonymous mutations in LasR, the master regulator of QS, are common among cystic fibrosis patients, but the impact of these mutations on phage interactions remains poorly understood. Here, we systematically investigated the role of QS in shaping these interactions using bacterial strains with functional or altered QS systems. In the QS-functional strain ZS-PA-35, disruption of the Las system reduces cell susceptibility to the type IV pili-dependent phage phipa2, delaying bacterial lysis during the early logarithmic growth phase. At high cell densities, Las-induced dormancy further inhibits phage proliferation despite enhanced phage adsorption. Notably, nutrient supplementation fully restores phage proliferation in the strains with a functional Las system. In contrast, the QS-deficient strain ZS-PA-05, carrying a LasR mutation, fails to regulate phage-host interactions via QS. Moreover, our findings reveal that within mixed microbial populations, cells benefit from the presence of closely related kin, which collectively reduce prey density and limit phage-host interaction frequencies under nutrient-rich conditions. These results underscore the flexibility of QS-regulated defense strategies, highlighting their critical role in optimizing bacterial resilience against phage predation, particularly in heterogeneous communities most vulnerable to phages.IMPORTANCEBacteria have developed various strategies to combat phage infection, posing challenges to phage therapy. In this study, we demonstrate that <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> strains with functional or altered quorum sensing (QS) systems may adapt different survival tactics for prolonged coexistence with phages, contingent upon bacterial population dynamics. The dynamics of phage infection highlight the influence of intrinsic heterogeneity mediated by QS, which leads to the emergence of different phage-host outcomes. These variants may arise as a result of coevolutionary processes or coexistence mechanisms of mutational and non-mutational defense strategies. These insights enhance our comprehension of how bacteria shield themselves against phage attacks and further underscore the complexity of such approaches for successful therapeutic interventions."

    "abstract": "Page kidney causes secondary hypertension due to external compression of the renal parenchyma and renal hypoperfusion. A 21-year-old healthy man was diagnosed with hypertension during a medical examination 3 months after he had gotten a bruise at the right lumbar region. The patient's blood pressure was 176/120 mmHg. Computed tomography showed a large encapsulated cystic lesion around the right kidney and severe external compression of the renal parenchyma. Dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scintigraphy revealed decreased right split renal function. Therefore, the patient was diagnosed with a Page kidney. Percutaneous drainage of the hematoma was performed. However, the hematoma enlarged again. Capsulectomy was subsequently performed. The pathological findings revealed capsule fibrosis and hyperplasia of the capillaries in the inner capsule layer. After capsulectomy, the patient's blood pressure normalized. Blood leakage from the fibrotic capsule likely maintained the hematoma. Capsulectomy is recommended in cases involving an encapsulated perineal hematoma."

    "title": "Elevated glucose increases methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus antibiotic tolerance in a cystic fibrosis airway epithelial cell infection model.",
    "abstract": "In a healthy lung, the airway epithelium regulates glucose transport to maintain low glucose concentrations in the airway surface liquid (ASL). However, hyperglycemia and chronic lung diseases, such as cystic fibrosis (CF), can result in increased glucose in bronchial aspirates. People with CF are also at increased risk of lung infections caused by bacterial pathogens, including methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus</i> aureus. Yet, it is not known how increased airway glucose availability affects bacteria in chronic CF lung infections or impacts treatment outcomes. To model the CF airways, we cultured immortalized CF (CFBE41o-) and non-CF (16HBE) human bronchial epithelial cells at air liquid interface (ALI). Glucose concentrations in the basolateral media were maintained at 5.5 mM or 12.5 mM, to mimic a normal and hyperglycemic milieu respectively. 2-deoxyglucose was added to high glucose culture media to restrict glucose availability. We collected ASL, basolateral media, and RNA from ALI cultures to assess the effects of elevated glucose. We also inoculated <i>S. aureus</i> onto the apical surface of normal or high glucose ALI cultures and observed the results of antibiotic treatment post-inoculation. <i>S. aureus</i> growth was measured by enumerating viable colony forming units (CFU) and with fluorescence microscopy. The effects of elevated glucose on <i>in vitro</i> growth and antibiotic treatment were also evaluated in standard bacterial culture medium and synthetic CF medium (SCFM). We found that glucose concentrations in the ASL of ALI cultures maintained in normal or high glucose mimicked levels measured in breath condensate assays from people with CF and hyperglycemia. Additionally, we found hyperglycemia increased <i>S. aureus</i> aggregation and antibiotic resistance during infection of cells maintained in high glucose compared to normal glucose conditions. Heightened antibiotic tolerance or resistance as not observed during <i>in vitro</i> growth with elevated glucose. Limiting glucose with 2-deoxyglucose both decreased aggregation and reduced antibiotic resistance back to levels comparable to non-hyperglycemic conditions. These data indicate hyperglycemia alters <i>S. aureus</i> growth during infection and may reduce efficacy of antibiotic treatment. Glucose restriction is a potential option that could be explored to limit bacterial growth and improve treatment outcomes in chronic airway infections."

    "abstract": "Distal intestinal obstruction syndrome (DIOS) presents significant management challenges for people with cystic fibrosis (pwC). We evaluated the treatment outcomes and identified risk factors associated with the need for surgical intervention in patients admitted with DIOS. We conducted a retrospective case series of 96 encounters of DIOS over a 20-year period, observing outcomes between cases of medical management versus those requiring for operative intervention. To our knowledge, this is the largest Australian study to review intervention in DIOS. Among the patients studied, 94.8% were successfully treated non-surgically. Using computed tomography (CT) confirmation of DIOS as the gold standard, only 9.1% of abdominal x-rays were accurate in finding DIOS. Gastrografin was used in half of cases and was associated with a shorter recovery time. One in 16 patients required operative management, with two cases experiencing surgery following prolonged medical treatment. A history of previous laparotomy increased the odds of requiring surgical intervention by 16 times (95% CI: 1.2-209.9, P = 0.035), while a history of meconium ileus increased the odds by 15.6 times (95% CI: 1.2-204.8, P = 0.036). All patients who underwent surgery also had pancreatic insufficiency. Medical management was successful in the majority of DIOS presentations. Our study emphasizes a low threshold for abdominal CT scans to identify complete DIOS in high-risk patients, particularly those with a history of laparotomy or meconium ileus, who may require surgical intervention. Furthermore, we advocate for the adjunctive use of Gastrografin alongside medical management. Future research should refine protocols for these high-risk groups to improve outcomes and reduce morbidity."

    "abstract": "Despite guideline recommendations to offer continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) to all patients with diabetes using insulin, prescription rates for CGM remain low in primary care. This quality improvement project aimed to improve access to CGM in primary care for patients with type 2 diabetes on insulin. This was a quality improvement project conducted by a joint endocrinology/primary care team at a single primary care community health clinic. After defining the problem through process mapping, driver diagrams, and Pareto charts, several interventions were trialed through Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles. The study team consisted of four endocrinologists, two primary care providers (MD/NP), the lead primary care nurse, and the primary care population health specialist. Interventions included a directory for durable medical equipment (DME) suppliers, nursing education with device company representatives, a new electronic ordering system for DME, and a nursing outreach program to patients eligible for CGM. The primary outcome was percentage of eligible patients using CGM. Process measures included the number of CGM orders started weekly. Nursing comfort with CGM, knowledge of CGM, and perceptions of communication with DME suppliers were also measured. The percentage of eligible patients using CGM increased from 28 to 42%, and the percentage of patients using CGM started in primary care increased from 8 to 14%. Weekly orders increased from 0.3 per week to 2.3 per week. Nursing reported feeling more comfortable and knowledgeable about CGM after the interventions and reported improved communication with DME suppliers. CGM is known to improve outcomes for patients with diabetes but is an underutilized tool in primary care. Collaborative quality improvement projects between endocrinology and primary care can rapidly build capacity within primary care to prescribe CGM and expand access for patients with diabetes who do not have endocrinologists."

    "abstract": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, leading to chronic, unresolved inflammation of the airways due to uncontrolled recruitment of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs). Evidence indicates that CFTR loss-of-function, in addition to promoting a pro-inflammatory phenotype, is associated with an increased risk of developing cancer, suggesting that CFTR can exert tumor-suppressor functions. Three-dimensional (3D) in vitro culture models, such as the CF lung airway-on-a-chip, can be suitable for studying PMN recruitment, as well as events of cancerogenesis, that is epithelial cell invasion and migration, in CF. To gather insight into the pathobiology of CFTR loss-of-function, we generated CFTR-knockout (KO) clones of the 16HBE14o- human bronchial cell line by CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing, and performed a comparative proteomic analysis of these clones with their wild-type (WT) counterparts. Systematic signaling pathway analysis of CFTR-KO clones revealed modulation of inflammation, PMN recruitment, epithelial cell migration, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Using a latest-generation organ-on-a-chip microfluidic platform, we confirmed that CFTR-KO enhanced PMN recruitment and epithelial cell invasion of the endothelial layer. Thus, a dysfunctional CFTR affects multiple pathways in the airway epithelium that ultimately contribute to sustained inflammation and cancerogenesis in CF."

Thirty children with CF (mean age = 10.2 ± 1.9 years) were randomly allocated to TG or HG. The exercise protocol was applied thrice a week for six weeks in the TG via Skype. The same exercises were sent in an exercise booklet to the HG, and phone contact was made once a week. Muscle function (one-minute sit-to-stand (1-min STS), sit-up, pushup, squat, and plank tests)), PA (Physical Activity Questionnaire for Older Children), and sleep (Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and Pediatric Sleep Questionnaire (PSQ)) were assessed before and after the 6-week study period. The 1-min STS significantly improved in the TG compared with the HG (<i>p</i> ≤ .001, <i>η</i><sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.474). The sit-up (<i>p</i> = .005, <i>η</i><sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.247), pushup (<i>p</i> = .002, <i>η</i><sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.180), squat (<i>p</i> = .002, <i>η</i><sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.284), and plank (<i>p</i> < .001, <i>η</i><sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.360) test scores were significantly improved in the TG compared to the HG.

Long-read genome sequencing (LRS) is used for identifying and phasing genomic variants, but further efforts are needed to develop LRS for applications using low-yield DNA samples. In this study, genomic DNA with high molecular weight was obtained from 2 cystic fibrosis patients, comprising a whole-blood sample (CF1) and a newborn dried blood spot sample (CF2). Library preparation and genome sequencing (30-fold coverage) were performed using 20 ng of DNA input on both the PacBio Revio system and the Illumina NovaSeq short-read sequencer. Single-nucleotide variants, small indels, and structural variants were identified for each data set. Our results indicated that the genotype concordance between long- and short-read genome sequencing data was higher for single-nucleotide variants than for small indels. Both technologies accurately identified known pathogenic variants in the <i>CFTR</i> gene (CF1: p.(Met607_Gln634del), p.(Phe508del); CF2: p.(Phe508del), p.(Ala455Glu)) with complete concordance for the polymorphic poly-TG and consecutive poly-T tracts. Using PacBio read-based haplotype phasing, we successfully determined the allelic phase and identified compound heterozygosity of pathogenic variants at genomic distances of 32.4 kb (CF1) and 10.8 kb (CF2). Haplotype phasing of rare pathogenic variants from minimal DNA input is achieved through LRS. This approach has the potential to eliminate the need for parental testing, thereby shortening the time to diagnosis in genetic disease screening."

In addition to providing sufficient calorie intake through enteral formulas, appetite stimulants may help address nutritional deficiencies and improve overall prognosis. This retrospective study included children who received cyproheptadine (CH) as an appetite stimulant for at least three consecutive months. Data on CH-related adverse effects, z-scores for weight, height, body mass index (BMI), and percentage of forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV<sub>1</sub>%) were collected from medical records. Z-scores of growth parameters were calculated at baseline (CH initiation), three months before baseline, and three and six months after treatment. The study included 45 children with a mean age of 11 years. One patient was on modulator therapy, one was pancreatic sufficient, and another one had diabetes. Only one patient was using enteral supplementation simultaneously with CH. Significant improvements in weight and BMI z-scores were observed from baseline to three months of CH therapy (p = 0.004 and p = 0.006, respectively), with no significant changes noted in the three months before treatment. A modest increase in weight and BMI z-scores was seen from three to six months of therapy. Additionally, FEV<sub>1</sub> z-scores significantly increased from baseline to three months of therapy, with no further improvement observed in the subsequent three months. Six months of CH therapy was associated with significant improvements in weight and BMI z-scores, particularly within the first three months. No adverse effects were reported. Given the deceleration in the rate of increase in anthropometric z-scores from the third to sixth month, a three-month duration of CH therapy appears to be optimal and sufficient for children with CF."

Elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI) is an oral, small molecule, highly effective Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) corrector-potentiator drug. In people with cystic fibrosis age > 12 years, ETI improves sinonasal symptoms, endoscopy findings, polyp size, and radiologic findings. This study evaluates changes in CRS in children ages 6-12 years newly started on ETI. This was a prospective, three center, pre-post study of 11 children age 6-11 years newly started on ETI. Study endpoints included the SN-5 sinonasal health survey, Sniffin' Kids olfaction test, a sinus computerized tomography (CT) scan, and nasal endoscopy with mucus sampling for full-length 16S rRNA sequencing microbiome analysis. Study visits were conducted before ETI and at a median of 9 months after treatment initiation. ETI lead to improvement in symptoms, endoscopy scores and radiologic findings of CRS. Olfaction was below normal at baseline and did not improve. The sinonasal microbiome was dominated by typically commensal organisms before and after treatment for most participants. Additionally, Staphylococcus aureus was found in five participants at baseline and six participants on treatment. ETI improves sinonasal symptoms and endoscopy findings in children 6-11 years of age. Olfaction did not improve with ETI treatment in this age group, suggesting that olfactory dysfunction associated with CF is established early in life. This younger cohort of pediatric patients presented with abundant Staphylococcus aureus and only very rare Pseudomonas aeruginosa at baseline or after treatment."

    "abstract": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a formidable opportunistic pathogen, is notorious for its ability to form biofilms and produce virulence factors that favor chronic infections, especially in cystic fibrosis patients. The misuse of disinfectants, combined with environmental leakage and biodegradation, has led to widespread exposure of microorganisms to sub-lethal concentrations of disinfectants, particularly quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs). This study investigates the interaction between QACs, specifically ethylbenzalkyl dimethyl ammonium chloride (EBAC), and the quorum sensing (QS) mechanisms governing P. aeruginosa behavior. The results demonstrate that exposure to sub-minimum inhibitory concentrations (sub-MICs) of EBAC not only enhances the biofilm-forming capability of P. aeruginosa isolates but also modulates the expression of crucial QS-regulated genes. Notably, the bacteria exhibit increased production of biofilm-associated virulence factors such as pyocyanin and elastase, and altered antibiotic susceptibility profiles, indicating a shift towards persistent infection phenotypes. These findings reveal that QAC exposure can significantly increase resistance to antibiotics and external stressors like hydrogen peroxide. These results emphasize the need to reassess the efficacy of QACs in clinical disinfection settings, particularly against P. aeruginosa infections, and highlight the potential for unintended consequences of their use regarding bacterial behavior and virulence. This study provides novel insights into the role of QACs in modulating QS-mediated virulence and antibiotic resistance, offering a new perspective on the risks associated with sub-lethal disinfectant exposure."

A meta-analysis assessed lung microbes in adults with non-CF bronchiectasis, collecting data using both culture-based and sequencing approaches through three international databases and three Chinese databases. Subgroups were categorized by disease stage: the stable group (S), the exacerbation group (E), and unclassified data consolidated into the undetermined group (U). Culture data were analysed in random-effects meta-analyses while sequencing data were processed using QIIME 2. A total of 98 studies were included with data from 54,384 participants worldwide. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most frequently isolated bacterium (S: 26[19-34]%, E: 23[20-25]%, U: 20[16-25]%), while not specified Mycobacterium avium complex exhibited the highest mycobacterial prevalence (S: 3[1-5]%, E: 4[2-5]%, U: 15[3-27]%). Aspergillus spp. (S: 15[-10-39]%, E: 2[1-3]%, U: 10[5-15]%) and Candida spp. (S: not applicable, E: 11[2-20]%, U: 10[-8-27]%) were predominant in fungi culture with variable distributions among groups. Rhinovirus was the most commonly detected virus with varying prevalence across airway sample types rather than disease stages (S-sputum: 18[-16-53]%, S-nasopharyngeal: 4[-1-9]%, E-sputum: 22[16-29]%, E-nasopharyngeal: 6[4-8]%). Sequencing results revealed notable antibiotic persistence of Pseudomonas in 16S, and significant domination of Candida in ITS. Our findings indicate consistent bacterial patterns throughout bronchiectasis stages in both culture and sequencing results. Viruses are extensively detected in stable patients but vary across different airway sample types. Lower bacterial diversity and higher fungal diversity may be associated with exacerbation risks."

    "abstract": "Shwachman-Diamond Syndrome (SDS) is an autosomal recessive disease belonging to the inherited bone marrow failure syndromes and characterized by hypocellular bone marrow, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, and skeletal abnormalities. SDS is associated with increased risk of developing myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and/or acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Although SDS is not primarily considered an inflammatory disorder, some of the associated conditions (e.g., neutropenia, pancreatitis and bone marrow dysfunction) may involve inflammation or immune system dysfunctions. We have already demonstrated that signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-3 and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) were hyperactivated and associated with elevated IL-6 levels in SDS leukocytes. In this study, we analyzed the level of phosphoproteins involved in STAT3 and mTOR pathways in SDS lymphoblastoid cells (LCLs) and the secretomic profile of soluble pro-inflammatory mediators in SDS plasma and LCLs in order to investigate the systemic inflammation in these patients and relative pathways. Twenty-six SDS patients and seven healthy donors of comparable age were recruited during the programmed follow-up visits for clinical evaluation at the Verona Cystic Fibrosis Center Human. The obtained samples (plasma and/or LCLs) were analyzed for: phosphoproteins, cytokines, chemokines and growth factors levels by Bio-plex technology; microRNAs profiling by next generation sequencing (NGS) and microRNAs expression validation by Real Time-PCR (RT-PCR) and droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) . We demonstrated dysregulation of ERK1/2 and AKT phosphoproteins in SDS, as their involvement in the hyperactivation of the STAT3 and mTOR pathways confirmed the interplay of these pathways in SDS pathophysiology. However, both these signaling pathways are strongly influenced by the inflammatory environment. Here, we reported that SDS is characterized by elevated plasma levels of several soluble proinflammatory mediators. In vitro experiments show that these pro-inflammatory genes are closely correlated with STAT3/mTOR pathway activation. In addition, we found that miR-181a-3p is down-regulated in SDS. Since this miRNA acts as a regulator of several pro-inflammatory pathways such as STAT3 and ERK1/2, its down-regulation may be a driver of the constitutive inflammation observed in SDS patients. The results obtained in this study shed light on the complex pathogenetic mechanism underlying bone marrow failure and leukemogenesis in SDS, suggesting the need for anti-inflammatory therapies for SDS patients."

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is an example of a previously fatal malignancy that has been transformed into a chronic disease with close-to-normal life expectancy since the advent of tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy. However, it remains relatively unknown if lung transplantation could successfully be performed in patients with CML. We describe the course of a 34-year-old woman with cystic fibrosis and advanced lung disease who was diagnosed with CML while undergoing lung transplant evaluation. She was initiated on imatinib with optimal treatment response; she achieved major molecular response (MMR) and deep molecular response (DMR) at 8 and 10 months of treatment, respectively. She developed progressive respiratory failure and underwent bilateral lung transplantation at close to 3 years after achieving MMR. At 6 years post-transplant, she has excellent graft function and remains in DMR on imatinib. Treated CML in DMR should be regarded as inactive malignancy and should not preclude patients from life-saving transplant consideration. Our case also demonstrates the feasibility of long-term immunosuppression on TKI therapy."

We confirmed these findings in newborn, inflammation-free samples of a CF animal model and further identified ultrastructural alterations in the olfactory epithelium and bulbs of these animals. We established that CFTR, the anion channel whose dysfunction causes CF, is dispensable for odor-evoked signaling in sensory neurons, yet CF animals displayed defective odor-guided behaviors consistent with the morphological and molecular alterations.

This study highlights variability in communication between pwCF and their healthcare teams regarding substance use, particularly when it comes to marijuana and CBD. The findings suggest a need for standardized guidelines and educational resources to improve recreational substance screening and discussion in CF clinical care, especially given the changing landscape of marijuana regulations and increasing use among pwCF."

    "title": "Changing Epidemiology of Pediatric Pulmonary Exacerbations in Cystic Fibrosis.",
    "abstract": "The introduction of elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI), a highly effective cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulator therapy, to younger ages and the COVID-19 pandemic have significantly reduced pulmonary exacerbations requiring hospitalization among children with CF. To assess demographic and clinical characteristics of children and young adults with CF hospitalized for pulmonary exacerbations before and after pediatric ETI approval. A retrospective chart review was conducted at five United States CF Foundation-accredited care centers. Hospitalization data from children and young adults with CF in 2018 and 2022 were analyzed. Hospitalizations decreased from 471 cases (241 individuals) in 2018 to 163 cases (110 individuals) in 2022. The racial distribution shifted, with more hospitalized patients identifying as people of color in 2022 (28% vs. 14%; p = 0.018). A greater proportion of hospitalized children in 2022 had two non-F508del mutations compared with children hospitalized in 2018 (38% vs. 19%) and were less likely to be infected with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Comparing 2022-2018, children on CFTR modulator therapy, including ETI (76%), showed reduced infections with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Achromobacter xylosoxidans. The decline in hospitalizations for pulmonary exacerbations likely reflects the benefits of ETI therapy, as a higher proportion of children and young adults hospitalized in 2022 had two non-F508del mutations and were not eligible for ETI. A greater percentage of those hospitalized in 2022 identified as belonging to minority racial groups, highlighting ongoing health disparities in the ETI era. Additionally, there were notable changes in the microbiological characteristics between 2018 and 2022."

    "title": "Copy Number Variations of Human Ribosomal Genes in Health and Disease: Role and Causes.",
    "abstract": "A number of association studies have linked ribosomal DNA gene copy number (rDNA CN) to aging and pathology. Data from these studies are contradictory and depend on the quantitative method. The hybridization technique was used for rDNA quantification in human cells. We determined the rDNA CN from healthy controls (HCs) and patients with schizophrenia (SZ) or cystic fibrosis (CF) (total number of subjects N = 1124). For the first time, rDNA CN was quantified in 105 long livers (90-101 years old). In addition, we conducted a joint analysis of the data obtained in this work and previously published by our group (total, N = 3264). We found increased rDNA CN in the SZ group (534 ± 108, N = 1489) and CF group (567 ± 100, N = 322) and reduced rDNA CN in patients with mild cognitive impairment (330 ± 60, N = 93) compared with the HC group (422 ± 104, N = 1360). For the SZ, CF, and HC groups, there was a decreased range of rDNA CN variation in older age subgroups compared to child subgroups. For 311 patients with SZ or CF, rDNA CN was determined two or three times, with an interval of months to several years. Only 1.2% of patients demonstrated a decrease in rDNA CN over time. We did not find significant rDNA CN variation in eight different organs of the same patient or in cells of the same fibroblast population. The results suggest that rDNA CN is a relatively stable quantitative genetic trait statistically associated with some diseases, which however, can change in rare cases under conditions of chronic oxidative stress. We believe that age- and disease-related differences between the groups in mean rDNA CN and its variance are caused by the biased elimination of carriers of marginal (predominantly low) rDNA CN values."

    "abstract": "Newborn screening (NBS) is an essential public health initiative for early diagnosis of inborn errors of metabolism (IEM), where timely intervention can reduce morbidity and mortality. While routine in developed countries, NBS is not widely practised in India. This study aimed to implement NBS programme in a tertiary care hospital in South India and validate predetermined cut-off values tailored to the regional population. Between 2020 and 2022, 5157 neonates were screened for congenital hypothyroidism (CH), congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), cystic fibrosis (CF), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency (G6PDD), phenylketonuria (PKU), galactosemia and biotinidase deficiency. Screening was performed using dissociation-enhanced lanthanide fluorescent immunoassay technology on Victor2D platform (Revvity). Markers assessed included 17-α-OH progesterone, neonatal thyroid stimulating hormone, total galactose, immunoreactive trypsinogen, G6PD enzyme, biotinidase enzyme and phenylalanine levels. Data analysis was conducted using R V.4.1.1 software. Of the 5157 neonates, the recall rates were consistent with those reported in similar studies. However, only 26.7% of screen-positive newborns returned for retesting, indicating a significant gap in awareness about IEMs and the importance of follow-up. Of these, none were diagnosed with CAH; however, four were found to have CH, two had galactosemia, three had G6PDD, one had CF, one had PKU and none had biotinidase deficiency. The confirmed cases were promptly treated and monitored regularly. The distribution of each marker's values fell within 2.5th-97.5th percentiles suggesting consistency. The reference ranges provided by the manufacturer appear valid in the Indian context. A key challenge identified was low follow-up compliance for screen-positive infants, highlighting the need for enhanced public education on IEM and NBS. Future research will focus on determining the incidence of IEMs and improving parental awareness and follow-up rates."

Greater awareness of AWP is needed since the vast majority of AWP cases are linked with cystic fibrosis (CF) and CF carrier state. Initial assessment of AWP cases can be done in a primary care setting. A comprehensive medical history and physical examination should be done upon the diagnosis of AWP with additional investigations based on patients' presentation. We report two cases of AWP diagnosed at a family medicine center in Dammam, Saudi Arabia. The first case was related to the use of ibuprofen and discounting this medication led to a marked improvement in the patient's symptoms. The second case was related to primary palmar hyperhidrosis that was managed successfully with topical 20% aluminum chloride."

    "abstract": "Lung cystic fibrosis (CF) is a lethal inherited disease caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (<i>CFTR</i>) gene, leading to a dysfunctional CFTR protein. Gene therapy offers promise for the treatment of lung CF. However, the development and clinical application of CF gene therapy have long been hampered by the absence of safe and highly efficient delivery vectors. In this work, a novel polymer-based gene replacement treatment approach was developed. A series of poly (β-amino esters) (PAEs) with various topological structures and chemical compositions were screened to create non-viral therapeutic systems for CFTR restoration in lung CF disease. A nanoparticle, formed by the selected highly branched PAE (HPAE) with a CpG-depleted CFTR plasmid, demonstrated <i>CFTR</i> gene expression and biocompatibility in lung epithelial cells, outperforming leading commercial gene transfection reagents such as Lipofectamine 3000 and Xfect. The newly developed gene therapy system successfully restored functional CFTR protein production in lung CF epithelial monolayers. This therapeutic approach holds great potential for use as an efficient and safe non-viral treatment for CF patients."

Corticosteroids are now recommended as adjunctive therapy in severe CAP to improve outcomes. In this prospective randomized animal study, we evaluated the bactericidal efficacy of various antibiotic regimens combined with corticosteroids using a porcine pneumococcal pneumonia model. In 30 White-Landrace female pigs, pneumonia was induced by intrabronchial inoculation of macrolide-resistant S. pneumoniae 19A isolate. Animals were randomized to receive saline, ceftriaxone (CRO) with levofloxacin (LVX), CRO with azithromycin (AZM), or combinations of these with methylprednisolone (MP). The primary outcome, S. pneumoniae concentrations in lung tissue after 48 h of treatment, showed that the CRO + LVX, CRO + AZM, CRO + LVX + MP, and CRO + AZM + MP groups were equally effective in reducing bacterial load. However, complete bacterial eradication from lung tissue was achieved only in the CRO + AZM + MP group. Secondary outcomes, including bacterial burden in tracheal aspirates and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples, showed similar bactericidal activity across all treatment groups. The CRO + AZM + MP group demonstrated the most controlled inflammatory response, achieving baseline levels of inflammation, while other groups exhibited elevated inflammatory markers. Despite using a macrolide-resistant S. pneumoniae isolate, the combination of CRO, AZM, and MP achieves similar or even superior results compared to other antibiotic combinations. This regimen provides both bactericidal and immunomodulatory benefits, suggesting its effectiveness in treating macrolide-resistant S. pneumoniae pneumonia."

Mucociliary-differentiated airway epithelial cell cultures, established from airway basal cells, are relevant in vitro model systems to examine the rhinovirus-stimulated innate immune responses and changes in barrier function. The airway epithelium in patients with chronic respiratory diseases such as asthma, cystic fibrosis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease often shows remodeling, such as goblet cell metaplasia, squamous metaplasia, and basal cell hyperplasia. Such changes profoundly affect the airway epithelial responses to rhinovirus infection. Previously, we have demonstrated that mucociliary-differentiated cell cultures, established from airway basal cells isolated from COPD patients, show goblet cell and basal cell hyperplasia similar to that observed in patients. These cultures also show a pro-inflammatory phenotype and abnormal innate immune responses to rhinovirus infection. We describe a culturing method that maintains these in vivo features."

Here, we show that these cycles are linked through enzymatic redundancy, with isocitrate lyase (AceA) exhibiting secondary 2-methylisocitrate lyase activity. Furthermore, we use a combination of structural analyses, enzyme kinetics, metabolomics, and targeted mutation of PrpB<sub>Pa</sub> to demonstrate that whereas loss of PrpB function impairs growth on propionate, the promiscuous 2-methylisocitrate lyase activity of AceA compensates for this by mitigating the accumulation of toxic 2-methylcitrate cycle intermediates. Our findings suggest that simultaneous inhibition of PrpB and AceA could present a robust antimicrobial strategy to target P. aeruginosa in propionate-rich environments, such as the cystic fibrosis airways. Our results emphasize the importance of understanding pathway interconnections in the development of novel antimicrobial agents."

This review provides an update on the latest understanding of IFALD pathogenesis, emerging therapies, and ongoing challenges in the management of this complication. A number of factors are associated with the development of IFALD. PN lipid emulsions, phytosterol exposure, bacterial dysbiosis, an altered gut-liver axis, and episodes of sepsis disrupt bile acid homeostasis and promote liver inflammation in the active phase of IFALD, favoring the development of PN-associated cholestasis (PNAC) and the more chronic form of steatohepatitis with fibrosis. Based on the identification of pathophysiological pathways, potential therapies are being studied in preclinical and clinical trials, including lipid emulsion modifications; targeted therapies such as Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and liver receptor homolog 1 (LRH-1) agonists, tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-2 analogs; microbiome modulation; and supplementation with choline and antioxidants. In conclusion, the pathogenesis of IFALD is complex, and PN dependence and liver injury remain challenging, particularly in patients with IF who cannot advance to enteral nutrition and be weaned off PN."

This trial assessed sipavibart efficacy and safety for prevention of symptomatic COVID-19 in participants who are immunocompromised. In this ongoing, double-blind, international, phase 3 trial, we enrolled participants who were immunocompromised and aged 12 years or older at 197 hospitals, university health centres, and clinical trial units in 18 countries. Participants were randomly allocated 1:1 to a sipavibart group (intramuscular sipavibart 300 mg on days 1 and 181) or a comparator group (tixagevimab 300 mg-cilgavimab 300 mg on day 1 and placebo on day 181 or placebo on days 1 and 181), stratified by previous COVID-19 vaccination and infection status and use of tixagevimab-cilgavimab. The primary efficacy outcomes were symptomatic COVID-19 caused by any variant or symptomatic COVID-19 caused by non-Phe456Leu-containing variants within 181 days of dosing, assessed in the SARS-CoV-2-negative set, comprising all participants without a positive RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 at baseline and who received at least one trial intervention dose. Safety outcomes for adverse events were assessed 90 days following the first dose and for serious adverse events throughout the study in the safety analysis set (ie, all participants who received at least one injection of sipavibart or comparator). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT05648110. Participants were screened from March 31 to Oct 27, 2023; 3349 participants (56·8% female) were randomly assigned: 1674 to the sipavibart group (five no first dose; 1669 sipavibart) and 1675 to the comparator group (nine no first dose; 1105 tixagevimab-cilgavimab and 561 placebo). Within 181 days of dosing, 122 (7·4%) of 1649 participants in the sipavibart group and 178 (10·9%) of 1631 participants in the comparator group had symptomatic COVID-19 due to any variant (relative risk reduction [RRR] 34·9% [97·5% CI 15·0 to 50·1]; p=0·0006), 54 (3·3%) participants in the sipavibart group and 90 (5·5%) participants in the comparator group had symptomatic COVID-19 due to non-Phe456Leu-containing variants (RRR 42·9% [95% CI 19·9 to 59·3]; p=0·0012), and 47 (2·9%) participants in the sipavibart group and 64 (3·9%) participants in the comparator group had symptomatic COVID-19 due to Phe456Leu-containing variants (30·4% [-1·8 to 52·5]). Adverse events occurred in 833 (49·9%) of 1671 participants in the sipavibart group and 857 (51·5%) of 1663 participants in the comparator group within 3 months of the first dose. One COVID-19-related death occurred in the comparator group. Serious adverse events considered related to trial intervention occurred in two (0·1%) of 1671 participants in the sipavibart group and seven (0·4%) of 1663 participants in the comparator group (none fatal). No serious cardiovascular or thrombotic events were considered to be related to sipavibart. The primary analysis showed efficacy and safety of sipavibart in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 in participants who are immunocompromised when susceptible (ie, non-Phe456Leu-containing) variants dominated, although no efficacy was shown against resistant (ie, Phe456Leu-containing) variants that dominate as of November, 2024.

This architecture robustly integrates cofactors, self-mediates reactions at maximum enzyme capacity, and facilitates metabolite intermediation/detection and interference inactivation through multifunctional enzymatic use. Accordingly, we developed sensors targeting 12 metabolites, with 100-fold-enhanced signal-to-noise ratio and days-long stability. Leveraging these sensors, we monitored trace endogenous metabolites in sweat/saliva for noninvasive health monitoring, and a bacterial metabolite in the brain, marking a key milestone for unraveling gut microbiota-brain axis dynamics."

However, PPC is not commonly integrated into routine pediatric nephrology care. This study explores the perspectives and experiences of healthcare providers (HCPs) to better understand the experiences and specific barriers related to PPC integration for children and adolescents with advanced CKD. We conducted a qualitative study with 23 HCPs, including nurses, psychologists, social workers, and physicians from seven German pediatric nephrology centers, analyzing semi-structured focus groups and individual interviews using structured content analysis. Five main categories emerged from the analysis, revealing HCPs' perceptions of CKD as a life-limiting condition, HCPs' moral distress in addressing end-of-life issues, and barriers to PPC integration. Although HCPs reported comprehensive multidisciplinary support for end-of-life situations, a lack of interprofessional communication occasionally hindered coordinated care. HCPs rarely addressed CKD's life-limiting nature proactively. A fear of diminishing hope led HCPs to avoid conversations about prognosis unless in response to a therapeutic crisis. PPC was mostly reserved for end-of-life cases, as HCPs associated PPC with terminal care and expressed concerns over distressing families. This study highlights the gap between guidelines recommending early integration of PPC and daily nephrology practice, which tends to introduce PPC late in the course of the disease. Training for nephrology teams could improve the quality of life for children with advanced CKD and their families by promoting early integration of primary PPC principles."

    "abstract": "Asthma experienced by both adults and children is a phenotypically heterogeneous condition. Severe asthma, characterized by ongoing symptoms and airway inflammation despite high doses of inhaled and/or systemic corticosteroids, is the focus of research efforts to understand this underlying heterogeneity. Clinical phenotypes in both adult and pediatric asthma have been determined using supervised definition-driven classification and unsupervised data-driven clustering methods. Efforts to understand the underlying inflammatory patterns of severe asthma have led to the seminal discovery of type 2-high versus type 2-low phenotypes and to the development of biologics targeted at type 2-high inflammation to reduce the rates of severe asthma exacerbations. Type 2-high asthma is characterized by upregulation of T helper 2 immune pathways including interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, and IL-13 along with eosinophilic airway inflammation, sometimes allergic sensitization, and responsiveness to treatment with corticosteroids. Type 2-low asthma is poorly responsive to corticosteroids and is not as well characterized as type 2-high asthma. Type 2-low asthma is limited by being defined as the absence of type 2-high inflammatory markers. Choosing a biologic for the treatment of severe asthma involves the evaluation of a panel of biomarkers such as blood eosinophils, total and specific immunoglobulin E/allergic sensitization, and fractional exhaled nitric oxide. In this review, we focus on the underlying pathobiology of adult and pediatric asthma, discuss the different phenotype-based treatment options for adult and pediatric type 2-high with or without allergic asthma and type 2-low asthma, and describe a clinical phenotyping approach to patients to guide out-patient therapy. Finally, we end with a discussion of whether pediatric asthma exacerbations necessitating admission to an ICU constitute their own high-risk phenotype and/or whether it is a part of other previously defined high-risk subgroups such as difficult-to-control asthma, exacerbation-prone asthma, and severe treatment-resistant asthma."

It is, however, not curative. Response to treatment also varies and lung disease, although slowed, remains progressive. We have previously demonstrated inhibition of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) by selective furin inhibition to be an alternative, mutation-agnostic approach that can enhance airways hydration and restore mucociliary transport (MCT) in CF. Inhibition of furin therefore, offers a potential therapeutic strategy for those ineligible, intolerant or nonresponsive to ETI and may provide a further opportunity for clinical benefit for those currently treated with ETI. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of furin inhibition on ETI responses to assess its utility as an adjunct therapy. Differentiated primary CF human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) were treated with the highly selective furin inhibitor BOS-318 and with ETI. Ion channel function was measured using a 24-channel Transepithelial Current Clamp (TECC-24) system and airways surface hydration was investigated by measuring airway surface liquid (ASL) height and MCT rate. The presence of BOS-318 had no effect on the ability of ETI to stimulate CFTR-mediated Cl<sup>-</sup> secretion but contributed a reduced Na<sup>+</sup> transport <i>via</i> robust inhibition of ENaC. This altered ion transport profile effected an improved ASL height and MCT rate, which were significantly greater than improvements observed with ETI alone, demonstrating the benefits of the dual approach. Selective furin inhibition has the potential to further improve clinical outcomes for all people with CF and offers opportunity as an adjunct to improve responses to currently available CFTR modulator therapies."

Protein expression profiling of ACBP/DBI was performed on mouse tissues to identify organs in which this major tissue hormone is expressed. Transcriptomic and proteomic data bases corroborated a high level of human-mouse interspecies conservation of ACBP/DBI expression in different organs. Single-cell RNA-seq data confirmed that ACBP/DBI was strongly expressed by parenchymatous cells from specific human and mouse organs (e.g., kidney, large intestine, liver, lung) as well as by myeloid or glial cells from other organs (e.g., adipose tissue, brain, eye) following a pattern that was conserved among the two species. We identified a panel of 44 mRNAs that are strongly co-expressed with ACBP/DBI mRNA in normal and malignant human and normal mouse tissues. Of note, 22 (50%) of these co-expressed mRNAs encode proteins localized at mitochondria, and mRNAs with metabolism-related functions are strongly overrepresented (66%). Systematic data mining was performed to identify transcription factors that regulate ACBP/DBI expression in human and mouse. Several transcription factors, including growth response 1 (EGR1), E2F Transcription Factor 1 (E2F1, which interacts with retinoblastoma, RB) and transformation-related protein 53 (TRP53, best known as p53), which are endowed with oncosuppressive effects, consistently repress ACBP/DBI expression as well as its co-expressed mRNAs across multiple datasets, suggesting a mechanistic basis for a coregulation network. Furthermore, we identified multiple transcription factors that transactivate ACBP/DBI gene expression together with its coregulation network. Altogether, this study indicates the existence of conserved mechanisms determining the expression of ACBP/DBI in specific cell types of the mammalian organism."

Of these, ano1 was expressed 10-100 times more than clcn2 in the gills; moreover, ano1 was upregulated during seawater acclimation, while clcn2 was not. Using an antibody raised against sea lamprey Ano1, we did not detect Ano1 in the gills of larvae, found elevated levels in juveniles and observed a 4-fold increase in juveniles after seawater acclimation. Ano1 was localized to seawater-type branchial ionocytes but, surprisingly, was localized to the basolateral membrane. In vivo pharmacological inhibition experiments demonstrated that a DIDS-sensitive mechanism was critical to the maintenance of osmoregulatory homeostasis in seawater- but not freshwater-acclimated sea lamprey. Taken together, our results provide evidence of a Cftr-independent mechanism for branchial Cl- secretion in sea lamprey that leverages Ano1-expressing ionocytes. Once further characterized, the Cftr-independent, Ano1-rich ionocytes of sea lamprey could reveal novel strategies for branchial Cl- secretion, whether by Ano1 or some other Cl- transporter, not previously known in ionoregulating marine organisms."

    "abstract": "<i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, an opportunistic pathogen, causes various biofilm-associated infections like pneumonia, infections in cystic fibrosis patients, and urinary tract and burn infections with high morbidity and mortality, as well as low treatment efficacy due to the extremely wide spread of isolates with multidrug resistance. Here, we report the new bacteriophage <i>Pseudomonas</i> phage Ka2 isolated from a tributary stream of Lake Baikal and belonging to the <i>Pbunavirus</i> genus. Transmission electron microscopy resolved that <i>Pseudomonas</i> phage Ka2 has a capsid of 57 ± 9 nm and a contractile and inflexible tail of 115 ± 10 nm in the non-contracted state. The genome consists of 66,310 bp with a GC content of 55% and contains 96 coding sequences. Among them, 52 encode proteins have known functions, and none of them are potentially associated with lysogeny. The bacteriophage lyses 21 of 30 <i>P. aeruginosa</i> clinical isolates and decreases the MIC of amikacin, gentamicin, and cefepime up to 16-fold and the MIC of colistin up to 32-fold. When treating the biofilms with Ka2, the biomass was reduced by twice, and up to a 32-fold decrease in the antibiotics MBC against biofilm-embedded cells was achieved by the combination of Ka2 with cefepime for the PAO1 strain, along with a decrease of up to 16-fold with either amikacin or colistin for clinical isolates. Taken together, these data characterize the new <i>Pseudomonas</i> phage Ka2 as a promising tool for the combined treatment of infections associated with <i>P. aeruginosa</i> biofilms."

    "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> The combination of ivacaftor, tezacaftor and elexacaftor (ETI) is approved for patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) aged two years and older and at least one F508del mutation in the CFTR gene. Variability in ETI treatment response has been repeatedly reported, and its reasons are unclear and understudied. <b>Objectives:</b> We present a novel liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for the rapid and simultaneous quantification of ETI in plasma, dried plasma spots (DPS), and whole blood volumetric absorptive microsampling (VAMS). <b>Methods:</b> The method utilizes a rapid extraction protocol with 200 μL methanol after the addition of deuterated internal standards. Chromatographic separation was achieved using a reversed-phase Hypersil Gold aQ column (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The method was validated according to ICH (International Council on Harmonisation) guidelines M10 for bioanalytical method validation, demonstrating linearity in the concentration range 0.020-12.000 µg/mL. It was also proved accurate and reproducible with no matrix effect. This method was applied to anonymized samples from patients undergoing ETI treatment: eight plasma and DPS and five VAMS samples were analyzed. <b>Results:</b> ETI concentrations measured in plasma and DPS were interchangeable, whereas ETI concentrations in VAMS were lower than in plasma, as expected for molecules with high plasma protein binding (99%). A correction factor based on the hematocrit value was used to calculate the equivalent plasma concentration from VAMS concentrations. <b>Conclusions:</b> This method is suitable for pharmacokinetic (PK) studies and could facilitate the centralization of samples to specialized laboratories, supporting multicenter studies."

    "title": "Discovery of Biofilm-Inhibiting Compounds to Enhance Antibiotic Effectiveness Against <i>M. abscessus</i> Infections.",
    "abstract": "<b>Background/Objectives</b>: <i>Mycobacterium abscessus</i> (MAB) is a highly resilient pathogen that causes difficult-to-treat pulmonary infections, particularly in individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF) and other underlying conditions. Its ability to form robust biofilms within the CF lung environment is a major factor contributing to its resistance to antibiotics and evasion of the host immune response, making conventional treatments largely ineffective. These biofilms, encased in an extracellular matrix, enhance drug tolerance and facilitate metabolic adaptations in hypoxic conditions, driving the bacteria into a persistent, non-replicative state that further exacerbates antimicrobial resistance. Treatment options remain limited, with multidrug regimens showing low success rates, highlighting the urgent need for more effective therapeutic strategies. <b>Methods</b>: In this study, we employed artificial sputum media to simulate the CF lung environment and conducted high-throughput screening of 24,000 compounds from diverse chemical libraries to identify inhibitors of MAB biofilm formation, using the Crystal Violet (CV) assay. <b>Results</b>: The screen established 17 hits with ≥30% biofilm inhibitory activity in mycobacteria. Six of these compounds inhibited MAB biofilm formation by over 60%, disrupted established biofilms by ≥40%, and significantly impaired bacterial viability within the biofilms, as confirmed by reduced CFU counts. In conformational assays, select compounds showed potent inhibitory activity in biofilms formed by clinical isolates of both MAB and <i>Mycobacterium avium</i> subsp. <i>hominissuis</i> (MAH). Key compounds, including ethacridine, phenothiazine, and fluorene derivatives, demonstrated potent activity against pre- and post-biofilm conditions, enhanced antibiotic efficacy, and reduced intracellular bacterial loads in macrophages. <b>Conclusions</b>: This study results underscore the potential of these compounds to target biofilm-associated resistance mechanisms, making them valuable candidates for use as adjuncts to existing therapies. These findings also emphasize the need for further investigations, including the initiation of a medicinal chemistry campaign to leverage structure-activity relationship studies and optimize the biological activity of these underexplored class of compounds against nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) strains."

This study compared clinical outcomes, hospitalization rates, and survival between children and adolescents with CF who received CFTR modulator therapies (ivacaftor, lumacaftor, tezacaftor, and elexacaftor). A retrospective cohort study was conducted using data from the TriNetX global collaborative network. Patients with CF aged 2-12 years (children) and 13-18 years (adolescents) who received CFTR modulator therapies were included. The propensity score matching balanced baseline characteristics between the two age groups. After propensity score matching, 946 patients per group were analyzed. The incidence of respiratory failure (3.81% vs. 1.06%, <i>p</i> < 0.001) and respiratory infections (62.7% vs. 57.5%, <i>p</i> = 0.021) were significantly higher in adolescents compared to children. Adolescents had a higher risk of respiratory failure (HR = 3.6, 95% CI = 1.79-7.21, <i>p</i> < 0.001) and respiratory infections (HR = 1.09, 95% CI = 1.01-1.17, <i>p</i> < 0.001). Adolescents also had a higher hospitalization rate (29.6% vs. 20.3%, <i>p</i> < 0.001), with a 47% higher risk (HR = 1.47, 95% CI = 1.22-1.77, <i>p</i> = 0.001), more hospital visits per person (8.8 vs. 3.7, <i>p</i> = 0.004), and longer hospital stays (32.7 vs. 20.4 days, <i>p</i> = 0.006). Mortality rates were similar between the groups (1.58% vs. 1.26%, <i>p</i> = 0.56). CF patients who initiated CFTR modulator therapies during adolescence had a higher incidence of respiratory failure, respiratory infections, hospitalization rates, and healthcare resource utilization compared to those who started therapy in childhood, despite similar mortality rates. These findings highlight the importance of the early initiation of CFTR modulator therapies."

    "abstract": "<b>Background/Objectives</b>: The pulmonary administration of antibiotics can be advantageous in treating pulmonary infections by promoting high intrapulmonary drug concentrations with reduced systemic exposure. However, limited benefits have been observed for pulmonary administration versus other administration routes due to its rapid clearance from the lung. Here, the effects of structural modifications on the epithelial permeability and antibacterial potency of a third-generation cephalosporin were investigated to improve the understanding of drug properties that promote intrapulmonary retention and how they may impact efficacy. <b>Methods</b>: Ceftazidime was modified by attaching 18 hydrophobic, hydrophilic, and mucus-binding motifs to the carboxylic acid distant from the beta-lactam by amidation. Epithelial permeability was investigated by drug transport assays using human bronchial epithelial air-liquid interface cultures. Antibacterial potency was determined by microtiter MIC assays with <i>B. pseudomallei</i>, <i>P. aeruginosa</i>, <i>E. coli</i>, and <i>S. aureus</i>. <b>Results</b>: A 40-50% reduction in the transepithelial transport rate was exhibited by two PEGylated ceftazidime analogs (mPEG8- and PEG5-pyrimidin-2-amine-ceftazidime) and n-butyl-ceftazidime. An increase in the transport rate was exhibited by four analogs bearing small and hydrophobic or negatively charged motifs (n-heptane-, phenyl ethyl-, glutamic acid-, and 4-propylthiophenyl boronic acid-ceftazidime). The antibacterial potency was reduced by ≥10-fold for most ceftazidime analogs against <i>B. pseudomallei</i>, <i>P. aeruginosa</i>, and <i>E. coli</i> but was retained by seven ceftazidime analogs primarily bearing hydrophobic motifs against <i>S. aureus</i>. <b>Conclusions</b>: The covalent conjugation of PEGs with MW > 300 Da reduced the epithelial permeability of ceftazidime, but these modifications severely reduced antibacterial activity.

However, the only available formulation on the market containing tobramycin, TOBI<sup>®</sup>, is sold at a price that makes the access to the treatment difficult. Therefore, this work focuses on the development and characterization of an ionic complex between a polyelectrolyte, hyaluronic acid (HA) and its salt, sodium hyaluronate (NaHA), and TOB to be formulated as an inhalable dry powder. <b>Methods:</b> The solid state complex obtained by spray drying technique was physicochemically characterized by infrared spectroscopy, thermal analysis and X-ray diffraction, confirming an ionic interaction for both complexes. <b>Results:</b> The powder density, geometric size, and morphology along with the aerodynamic performance showed suitable properties for the powder formulations to reach the deep lung. Moisture uptake was found to be low, with the complex HA-TOB remaining physicochemically unchanged, while the NaHA-TOB required significant protection against humidity. The biopharmaceutical in vitro experiments showed a rapid dissolution which can have a positively impact in reducing side effects, while the drug release study demonstrated a reversible polyelectrolyte-drug interaction. Microbiological experiments against <i>P. aeruginosa</i> and <i>S. aureus</i> showed improved bacterial growth inhibition and bactericidal efficacy, as well as better inhibition and eradication of biofilms when compared with to TOB. <b>Conclusions:</b> A simple polyelectrolyte-drug complex technique represents a promising strategy for the development of antimicrobial dry powder formulations for pulmonary delivery in the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) lung infections."

    "abstract": "The lack of available treatments in pediatric non-cystic fibrosis (non-CF) bronchiectasis is a major concern, especially in the context of the increasing disease burden due to better detection rates with advanced imaging techniques. Recurrent infections in these patients are the main cause of deterioration, leading to impaired lung function and increasing the risk of morbidity and mortality. Since pediatric non-CF bronchiectasis with early recognition and appropriate treatment can be reversible, optimal management is an issue of growing significance. The use of inhaled antibiotics as a treatment option, although a standard of care for CF patients, has been poorly studied in patients with non-CF bronchiectasis, especially in children. In this review, we present the current data on the potential use of inhaled antibiotics in the treatment of non-CF bronchiectasis and assess their safety and efficacy profile, focusing mainly on children. We conclude that inhaled antibiotics as an adjuvant maintenance treatment option could be tried in a subgroup of patients with frequent exacerbations and recent or chronic <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> infection as they appear to have beneficial effects on exacerbation rate and bacterial load with minimal safety concerns. However, the level of evidence in children is extremely low; therefore, further research is needed on the validity of this recommendation."

    "abstract": "Antipseudomonal antibiotics are frequently used in patients admitted to hospitals. Many of these substances are classified as a reserve or watch status by the WHO. Inappropriate risk assessment of invasive detection of P. aeruginosa (PAE) can be a reason for overuse of antipseudomonal antibiotics. Therefore it is important to define relevant and specific risk factors for invasive PAE detection. The objective of this study was to identify risk factors for invasive detection of PAE in patients upon hospital admission. All patients 18 years of age and older with a detection of PAE and/or Enterobacterales in clinical samples taken within 48 h of admission to one of the hospitals of Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin between 2015 and 2020 were included into this retrospective cohort study. Overall, we included a total of 27,710 patients. In 3,764 (13.6%) patients PAE was detected in clinical samples taken within 48 h after admission. The most frequently detected Enterobacterales was E. coli in 14.142 (51%) patients followed by Klebsiella spp. in 4.432 (16%) patients. Multivariable regression analysis identified that prior colonisation with a multi drug resistant PAE or detection of a PAE in clinical samples during a previous hospitalisation increased the risk for invasive detection of PAE (OR 39.41; 95% CI 28.54-54.39) and OR 7.87 (95% CI 6.60-9.38) respectively. Admission to a specialised ward for patients with cystic fibrosis was associated with an increased risk (OR 26.99; 95% CI 20.48-35.54). Presence of chronic pulmonary disease (OR 2.05; 95% CI 1.85-2.26), hemiplegia (OR 2.16; 95% CI 1.90-2.45) and male gender (OR 1.60; 95% CI 1.46-1.75) were associated with a modest increase in risk for presence of PAE. Patients with a prior detection of P. aeruginosa or admission to a cystic fibrosis ward had the highest risk for invasive detection of P. aeruginosa. Adherence to specific risk scores based on local risk factors could help to optimize prescription of anti-pseudomonal antibiotics that categorized as reserve and watch."

Purpose To determine the prevalence and characteristics of pericardial calcification, and identify clinical variables associated with it, in adult patients with CF and to compare this prevalence with that in individuals without CF. Materials and Methods This was a retrospective, single-center case-control study including consecutive patients with CF who underwent chest CT between January 2021 and December 2022. Control group 1 included individuals without CF matched for age and sex. Control group 2 included individuals with previous <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> infection and no concomitant diagnosis of CF matched for sex. Control group 3 included patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations of pericardial calcification were performed. The χ<sup>2</sup> test and Fisher exact test were used for comparisons of categorical variables; the Kruskal-Wallis test and Mann-Whitney <i>U</i> test were used for comparisons of continuous variables. Results Of the 348 adult patients with CF (mean age, 35 years ± 13 [SD]; 193 [55%] male patients), 62 (18%) had pericardial calcification at CT. The prevalence of pericardial calcification was 1% (four of 348) in control group 1, 2% (two of 100) in control group 2, and 4% (one of 24) in control group 3 (<i>P</i> < .001). Pericardial calcification developed de novo in 66% (41 of 62) and progressed in 21% (13 of 62) of patients with CF. The distribution of pericardial calcification in patients with CF was most frequently multifocal (58%; 36 of 62). The median calcium score of pericardial calcification was 65 (IQR, 28-375). In patients with CF, older age, lower forced expiratory volume in 1 second, higher vitamin D level, and a higher prevalence of <i>Burkholderia cenocepacia</i> ET12 infection were associated with pericardial calcification. Conclusion Pericardial calcification was more prevalent in adult patients with CF than in individuals without CF and progressed over time in some patients. © RSNA, 2025 <i>Supplemental material is available for this article.</i>"

The aim of this study was to undertake a comprehensive analysis of lung function and mechanics of the adult β-ENaC-Tg model. Adult β-ENaC-Tg and wild-type littermates underwent X-ray velocimetry (XV) scans using a Permetium XV scanner (4DMedical, Melbourne, Australia). For comparative lung mechanics, lung function assessments were conducted with a flexiVent system (SCIREQ, Montreal, Canada). XV imaging demonstrated elevated ventilation defect percentage, mean specific ventilation, and ventilation heterogeneity in β-ENaC-Tg mice. Spatial analysis of ventilation maps indicated increased ventilation variability in the peripheral lung regions, as well as an increased proportion of under-ventilated areas. The flexiVent analysis indicated that compared to wild types, β-ENaC-Tg mice have a significantly more compliant lungs with increased inspiratory capacity, reduced tissue elastance, and increased hysteresivity (heterogeneity), suggesting loss of parenchymal integrity.

    "abstract": "Type IVa pili (T4aP) are important virulence factors for many bacterial pathogens. Previous studies suggested that the retraction ATPase, PilT, modulates pathogenicity due to its critical role in pilus dynamics and twitching motility. Here we use a <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> slow-killing model to show that hyperpiliation, not loss of pilus retraction, reduces virulence of <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> strains PAK and PA14. Hyperactivating point mutations in the <i>P. aeruginosa</i> PilSR two-component system that controls transcription of the major pilin gene, <i>pilA</i>, increased levels of surface pili to the same extent as deleting <i>pilT</i>, without impairing twitching motility. These functionally hyperpiliated PilSR mutants had significant defects in pathogenicity that were rescued by deleting <i>pilA</i> or through disruption of hyperpiliation via deletion of the type III secretion system needle-length regulator, PscP. Hyperpiliated <i>pilT</i> deletion or <i>pilO</i> point mutants showed similar PilA-dependent impairments in virulence, validating the phenotype. Together, our data support a model where a surfeit of pili reduces virulence, potentially through the prevention of effective engagement of contact-dependent virulence factors. These findings suggest that the role of T4aP retraction in virulence should be revised.IMPORTANCE<i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> is a major contributor to hospital-acquired infections and particularly problematic due to its intrinsic resistance to many front-line antibiotics. Strategies to combat this and other important pathogens include the development of anti-virulence therapeutics. We show that the pathogenicity of <i>P. aeruginosa</i> is impaired when the amount of T4aP expressed on the cell surface increases, independent of the bacteria's ability to twitch. We propose that having excess T4aP on the cell surface may physically interfere with productive engagement of the contact-dependent type III secretion toxin delivery system. A better understanding of how T4aP modulate interaction of bacteria with target cells will improve the design of therapeutics targeting components involved in the regulation of T4aP expression and function to reduce the clinical burden of <i>P. aeruginosa</i> and other T4aP-expressing bacteria."

As a result, cystic fibrosis patients often experience infections from bacteria, which contribute to the disease progression. <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> is one of the most common opportunistic pathogens associated with cystic fibrosis. The presence of <i>P. aeruginosa</i> complicates the treatment due to its high antibiotic resistance. Thus, research is ongoing to treat these infections with bacterial viruses instead, known as bacteriophages.

In this study, we compared the defense system repertoire of <i>P. aeruginosa</i> strains isolated from cystic fibrosis patients with those from non-cystic fibrosis patients. Our findings reveal that <i>P. aeruginosa</i> strains isolated from cystic fibrosis patients have fewer phage defense mechanisms per strain than from non-cystic fibrosis patients, suggesting altered phage selection pressures in strains colonizing CF patient lungs.IMPORTANCECystic fibrosis patients often experience chronic <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> lung infections, which are challenging to treat with antibiotics and contribute to disease progression and eventual respiratory failure. Phage therapy is being explored as an alternative treatment strategy for these infections. However, assessing strain susceptibility to phage treatment is essential for ensuring efficacy. To address this, we investigated whether CF-associated clinical <i>P. aeruginosa</i> strains have a distinct phage defense repertoire compared with those isolated from other lung patients.

Baseline characteristics are presented for the whole group and cross-sectional comparisons made according to the presence of ABPA or not in 2009. Longitudinal analysis from 2009 to 2019 was completed on the group without ABPA in 2009 to identify predictors for the subsequent development of ABPA using a complementary log-log regression model. In 2009, there were 1612 patients, of which 1420 were ABPA-negative and 192 ABPA-positive. <i>Aspergillus</i> colonisation (<i>p</i> = 0.01) and IV antibiotic use (<i>p</i> < 0.0001) were associated with having ABPA in 2009. Longitudinal analysis of the group without ABPA in 2009 identified male gender, younger age, lower lung function, <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> infection, and <i>Aspergillus</i> colonisation to be significantly associated with the development of ABPA (<i>p</i> < 0.0001). Ivacaftor was significantly associated with reduced ABPA (OR 0.46, <i>p</i> = 0.01) but not lumacaftor/ivacaftor (OR 0.64, <i>p</i> = 0.28). Chronic oral macrolide use was significantly associated with increased risk of development of ABPA (OR 1.30, <i>p</i> < 0.0001). This study shows that lower lung function, <i>Aspergillus</i> colonisation, and <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> infection in children with CF were associated with the development of ABPA, highlighting the need for enhanced surveillance in these patients. This is the first study to show a protective association of ivacaftor and ABPA."

    "title": "Unraveling the Mechanism of Action, Binding Sites, and Therapeutic Advances of CFTR Modulators: A Narrative Review.",
    "abstract": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a recessive genetic disease caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein, a chloride and bicarbonate channel localized on the plasma membrane of epithelial cells. Over the last three decades, high-throughput screening assays have been extensively employed in identifying drugs that target specific defects arising from CFTR mutations. The two main categories of such compounds are potentiators, which enhance CFTR gating by increasing the channel's open probability, and correctors, which improve CFTR protein folding and trafficking to the plasma membrane. In addition to these, other investigational molecules include amplifiers and stabilizers, which enhance the levels and the stability of CFTR on the cell surface, and read-through agents that promote the insertion of correct amino acids at premature termination codons. Currently, four CFTR modulators are clinically approved: the potentiator ivacaftor (VX-770), either as monotherapy or in combination with the correctors lumacaftor (VX-809), tezacaftor (VX-661), and elexacaftor (VX-445). Among these, the triple combination VX-445/VX-661/VX-770 (marketed as Trikafta<sup>®</sup> in the US and Kaftrio<sup>®</sup> in Europe) has emerged as the most effective CFTR modulator therapy to date, demonstrating significant clinical benefits in phase III trials for patients with at least one F508del CFTR allele. Despite these advancements, the mechanisms of action and binding sites of these modulators on CFTR have only recently begun to be elucidated. A deeper understanding of these mechanisms could provide essential insights for developing more potent and effective modulators, particularly in combination therapies. This narrative review delves into the mechanism of action, binding sites, and combinatorial effects of approved and investigational CFTR modulators, highlighting ongoing efforts to broaden therapeutic options for individuals with CF."

    "title": "Duodenal Organoids From Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatohepatitis Patients Exhibit Absorptive and Barrier Alterations.",
    "abstract": "Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) is a progressive liver disease that can lead to fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Though MASH is closely tied to metabolic risk factors, the underlying pathogenic mechanisms remain scarcely understood. Recent research has emphasized the importance of the gut-liver axis in its pathogenesis, an aspect less explored in human studies. Here, we investigated whether the duodenal epithelium of MASH patients could exhibit intrinsic dysfunctions. Duodenal epithelial organoids were generated from 16 MASH patients and 14 healthy controls. Biopsies and patient-derived organoid transcriptomes were then analyzed to evaluate if specific intestinal pathways were differentially modulated in MASH subjects. Functional assays were performed to assess the duodenal epithelial absorptive potential and barrier functionality. Organoid formation efficiency was similar between control-derived duodenal epithelial organoids and MASH-derived duodenal epithelial organoids (MDEOs) (71% and 69%, respectively). Despite global heterogeneity in growth patterns, MDEOs frequently exhibited cystic spheroid morphology. MDEOs displayed altered digestive potential associated with reduced mature absorptive cell fate, but they retained their lipid metabolic capacity, possibly mediated by lipid oxidation in stem/progenitor cells. Additionally, MDEOs misexpressed components of tight and adherens junctions and desmosomes compared to controls. However, MDEOs maintained pore and leak pathway integrity, indicating that the duodenal epithelial barrier remained functionally preserved under tested conditions. This study provides evidence that the duodenal epithelium of MASH patients exhibits significant alterations in its nutrition-related and barrier functions. This study sheds light on the intricate dynamics of duodenal epithelial alterations in MASH, highlighting potential therapeutic avenues for restoring intestinal functions."

    "abstract": "Nephronophthisis (NPH) is an autosomal recessive interstitial cystic kidney disease, which is the most common genetic cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in childhood. The Hippo pathway is regulated by the cilium and has been suggested to be linked to NPH. The aim of the study was to investigate the involvement of Hippo pathway in the pathogenesis of nphp1 defect-associated NPH (NPH1). Nphp1 knockout (nphp1<sup>KO</sup>) Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells and nphp1<sup>KO</sup> C57BL/6J mice were generated via CRISPR gene editing strategy. The siRNAs targeting Kibra, MST1 and LATS1 were designed. An AAV9 vector was designed for Kibra knockdown. The expression and phosphorylation of core Hippo pathway molecules were evaluated. Pathological renal changes were evaluated via light microscopy respectively with haematoxylin-eosin and Masson staining. In nphp1<sup>KO</sup> MDCK cells, nphp1<sup>KO</sup> mice and NPH1 patients' kidneys, Kibra, p-MST1/2, p-LATS and p-YAP exhibited a notable increase in levels, with an even greater elevation observed in renal cyst cells, indicating the Hippo pathway activated in these nphp1-deficient contexts. Nphp1 re-expression reversed the Hippo pathway activation in cells, indicating that the Hippo pathway activation is related to nphp1 deficiency in vitro. Meanwhile, in vitro, MST1 knockdown downregulated LATS1 and YAP phosphorylation, LATS1 knockdown downregulated YAP phosphorylation, suggesting the activation of the canonical Hippo pathway in nphp1-deficient contexts. Knockdown of the upstream regulator Kibra inhibited the Hippo pathway activation in both nphp1<sup>KO</sup> MDCK cells and mice. Following Kibra knockdown, the organisation of nphp1<sup>KO</sup> MDCK cells became more compact, the intensity of the actin fibres increased. Besides, decreased renal fibrosis and cyst formation were observed in nphp1<sup>KO</sup> mice. The canonical Hippo pathway is aberrantly activated in nphp1-deficient conditions. Kibra may serve as a crucial upstream regulator of nphp1 deficiency-related Hippo pathway activation. Kibra upregulation and activation of the Hippo pathway are involved in the pathogenesis of NPH1. Canonical Hippo pathway activated in nphp1-deficient disease models and patients. Kibra was a key upstream molecule in regulating the activation of canonical Hippo pathway in nphp1-deficient disease models and patients and closely related to renal cyst formation and fibrosis in nphp1<sup>KO</sup> mice."

    "abstract": "A novel lytic bacteriophage, PSA-KC1, was isolated from wastewater. In this study, the whole genome of the bacteriophage PSA-KC1 was analyzed, and its lytic properties were assessed. PSA-KC1 has a linear double-stranded DNA genome with a total length of 43,237 base pairs and a GC content of 53.6%. In total, 65 genes were predicted, 46 of which were assigned functions as structural proteins involved in genome replication, packaging or phage lysis. PSA-KC1 belongs to the genus Septimatrevirus under the Caudoviricetes class. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of the lytic bacteriophage PSA-KC1 and compare it with that of the Pyophage phage cocktail on 25 multi drug resistant (MDR) Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains isolated from sputum samples of cystic fibrosis patients. Seventeen of these strains were susceptible (68%) to the PSA-KC1 lytic phage we isolated, whereas eight clinical strains were resistant. However, 22 (88%) of the P. aeruginosa strains were susceptible to the Pyophage cocktail, and three (12%) were resistant to the Phage cocktail. At the end of our study, a new lytic phage active against multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa strains from CF patients was isolated, and its genome was characterized. Since the PSA-KC1 phage does not contain virulence factors, toxins or integrase genes, it can be expected to be a therapeutic candidate with the potential to be used safely in phage therapy."

However, it is unclear whether IBD risk is associated with genetic or immune signatures. SLC26A3 interacts with several ion transporters linked to intestinal inflammation, such as cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and solute carrier family 9 member 3 (SLC9A3) causing congenital sodium diarrhea. We hypothesized that other epithelial channels affecting intestinal salt balance might modulate CLD phenotype or IBD risk. We analyzed 495 gene variants within 33 ion transporters among 28 patients with CLD and 44,443 population controls. We found three intronic variants at or near the CFTR locus (rs17132543, rs2283054 and rs76622533) showing statistically significant (P < 1.42x10-5) associations with CLD. These data demonstrate enrichment of rare variants at the CFTR locus in chromosomes harboring the Finnish founder mutation for CLD."

It is refractory to treatment making the patient dependent on total parenteral nutrition. Immune dysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, X-linked syndrome (IPEX), is one of the rarest causes of intractable diarrhea. It occurs due to mutations in the FOXP3 gene, leading to dysfunction of T-regulatory cells and is characterised by diarrhoea, diabetes, and dermatitis.

The objective was to compare P. aeruginosa virulence and the patient's immune response during stable phases and exacerbations of bronchiectasis. We used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) to perform molecular characterization of the genomic islands and virulence genes present in 42 P. aeruginosa strains obtained from the sputum of patients with bronchiectasis during stability and exacerbations. Immunoglobulin (Ig) and interleukin (IL) levels in 32 serum samples were analyze by ELISA and Luminex assay. A greater presence of the conjugative element pKLC102, specific virulence genes (exoS, exoY) and pyoverdine production characterize the P. aeruginosa strains obtained during exacerbations. The expression levels of type III secretion system (exoS, exoY) showed an important role in the humoral immune response during exacerbations. Exacerbations were associated with high levels of IL-6. The presence of specific genomic islands, virulence genes, and increased IL-6 levels provide an accurate characterization on bronchiectasis exacerbations. These targets could be useful in the prevention, management and treatment of these exacerbations."

    "abstract": "Symptoms of depression and anxiety can contribute to lower medical treatment adherence. Given that people with cystic fibrosis (PWCF) have higher rates of depressive and anxiety symptoms than those without cystic fibrosis (CF), this study examined factors that mediated the association between mental health and adherence. Participants were 294 adults (M age=25 years) with CF who were enrolled in the Daily Care Check-in Validation Study. Participants completed in-clinic questionnaires that assessed depressive and anxiety symptoms, perceived barriers to self-management, and medication self-efficacy. Medication adherence was measured by pharmacy refill data. Parallel mediation models assessed perceived barriers and medication self-efficacy as mediators between depressive symptoms and adherence, and between anxiety symptoms and adherence. Perceived interference of barriers to self-management significantly mediated the association between depressive symptoms and adherence (β =-0.005, SE=0.002, 95 % CI [-0.009, -0.001]), and between anxiety symptoms and adherence (β=-0.005, SE=0.003, 95 % CI [-0.008, -0.001]). Additionally, self-efficacy significantly mediated the association between depressive symptoms and adherence (β=-0.004, SE=0.001, 95 % CI [-0.007, -0.002]), and between anxiety symptoms and adherence (β=-0.004, SE=0.001, 95 % CI [-0.007, -0.001]). This study found that when PWCF experienced mental health symptoms (either anxiety or depression), they were likely to report more interference from barriers to disease management or experience less medication self-efficacy, which was related to worse adherence. Building self-efficacy around taking medications may reduce the impact that mental health symptoms have on adherence. Care teams should also work with PWCF to minimize the impact of barriers on daily therapies."

    "abstract": "CFTR modulators represent the international standard of care for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF). Yet due to prices of over $250,000 per year they are functionally inaccessible for people with CF (pwCF) unless reimbursed by healthcare systems. Current prices are unaffordable for payors in almost all low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) worldwide, and resulting disparities in access are widening existing global health inequities. In comparable situations in other therapeutic areas, patients have successfully developed strategies to bypass national reimbursement systems and gain access to treatment. We therefore undertook an international survey of CF clinicians in 15 countries where CFTR modulators are not reimbursed, to characterise alternative means of accessing modulator therapy. Successful methods were identified in 11 countries, and could broadly be categorised into legal challenges to access originator modulators, use of generic formulations, and access via donations. Aside from domestically produced generics used in Argentina and an originator-led donation program in Ukraine, these methods were only able to provide treatment to limited proportions of the local CF population due to significant associated financial costs. Accordingly, they are generally not sustainable or widely applicable, and fail to address the underlying structural issues driving international disparities in access. Twelve years after the initial marketing of CFTR modulators, pwCF in LMICs are being forced to take extraordinary measures to access disease-modifying treatment. Corrective measures are urgently required to overcome barriers posed by restrictive patents and prohibitively high prices, and to promote global health equity for pwCF."

NTM-PD can severely impair lung function and quality of life, potentially leading to both increased healthcare costs and mortality. There is a lack of comprehensive understanding of the disease burden and healthcare gaps from the patients' perspective. The European NTM-PD Patient Disease Experience (ENPADE) survey aimed to collect insights into these aspects. The survey aim was addressed by several methods. First, an online questionnaire was carried out from July 2021 to February 2022 across eight European countries for quantitative data collection. Additionally, semi-structured qualitative patient interviews were conducted with a subset of patients, eliciting their insights on the aspects surveyed. Descriptive statistics were used for quantitative analysis and interview outcomes were categorised along the online questionnaire for qualitative analysis. A total of 543 patients participated in the survey and 23 patients were interviewed. Satisfaction with care received before and after diagnosis was scored, on average, moderate with 32% \"highly satisfied\" patients and 25% \"highly dissatisfied\" patients across the aspects surveyed. Dissatisfaction was expressed particularly regarding referral and access to expert care, and information received on their disease and its management. Patients reported high restrictions in daily life (49%), work (31%), and social activities (43%), often leading to substantial emotional distress, such as experiencing an increase in feeling depressed or anxious (82%). Interviews with patients highlighted a need for improved disease information, faster diagnosis, and enhanced physician-patient relationships. The ENPADE survey outcomes revealed dissatisfaction among patients with care and restrictions in daily life, work, and social activities, often leading to emotional distress. These findings underscore the need for improved disease information, standardised care, and enhanced physician-patient relationships with appropriate support measures."

Historically, pregnancy was not recommended in this population; however, more recent evidence has revealed inconsistent survival and lung function outcomes. Our aim was to assess the differences in survival and lung function between pregnant and never-pregnant pwCF and to provide updated recommendations for contemporary clinical practice. In this retrospective matched parallel cohort study, data was collected from the American Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Patient Registry (CFFPR) from 1999 to 2019. 1743 adult pwCF with a reported pregnancy were matched with 1743 never-pregnant patients. Regression models were developed to estimate associations between patient characteristics, pregnancy, and outcomes. The primary endpoint was the probability of survival comparing pregnant and never-pregnant pwCF, while the secondary endpoint was lung function over time. The study cohort (n = 3486) had a mean age of 24.96 years. There was no significant difference in survival probabilities between pregnant and never-pregnant pwCF (56.2 %, CI<sup>95 %</sup>: 51.3 %-61.5 % vs. 55.8 %, CI<sup>95 %</sup>: 52.1 %-59.7 %, p = 0.5). The multivariable time-dependent Cox regression analysis resulted in a significantly lower mortality hazard rate for pregnant cohorts (HR:0.78, p < 0.01). There was no significant association between pregnancy and lung function over time (0.99, p = 0.21). Pregnancy was associated with a reduced hazard of death compared to never-pregnant pwCF and did not demonstrate a significant impact on lung function. Therefore, pregnancy should not be generally discouraged in pwCF and clinicians should evaluate pregnancy risks and benefits on an individualized basis."

This cell population comprises a mixed population of basal cells (BCs), the predominant stem cell in airways capable of both self-renewal and functional differentiation. Despite their potential for regenerative medicine, BCs exhibit significant phenotypic variability in culture. To investigate how culture conditions influence BC phenotype and function, we expanded three independent BC isolates in three media: airway epithelial cell growth medium (AECGM), dual-SMAD inhibitor (DSI)-enriched AECGM, and PneumaCult Ex plus (PEx+). Analysis through RNA sequencing, immune assays, and impedance measurements revealed that PEx+ media significantly drove cell proliferation and a broad proinflammatory phenotype in BCs. In contrast, BCs expanded in AECGM and displayed increased expression of structural and extracellular matrix components at higher passage. AECGM increased expression of some cytokines at high passage, whereas DSI suppressed inflammation implicating the involvement TGF-β in BC inflammatory processes. Differentiation capacity of BCs declined with time in culture irrespective of expansion media. This was associated with an increase in PLUNC expressing secretory cells in AECGM and PEx+ media consistent with the known immune modulatory role of PLUNC in the airways. These findings highlight the profound impact of media conditions on inflammatory niche established by, and function of, in vitro expanded BCs. The broad proinflammatory phenotype driven by PEx+ media, in particular, should be considered in the development of cell-based models for airway diseases and therapeutic applications.<b>NEW & NOTEWORTHY</b> Airway basal cells, vital for airway regeneration and potential therapies, show significant changes based on culture conditions. Our study reveals that media composition and culture duration greatly affect basal cell properties with profound changes in the proinflammatory phenotype and extracellular matrix deposition driven by changes in growth conditions.

IgY serves as a valuable alternative to mammalian antibodies typically used in immunodiagnostics and immunotherapy. Compared to mammalian antibodies, IgY offers several biochemical advantages, and its straightforward purification from egg yolk eliminates the need for invasive procedures like blood collection, reducing stress in animals. Due to the evolutionary differences between birds and mammals, chicken antibodies can bind to a broader range of epitopes on mammalian proteins than their mammalian counterparts. Studies have shown that chicken antibodies bind 3-5 times more effectively to rabbit IgG than swine antibodies, enhancing the signal in immunological assays. Additionally, IgY does not interact with rheumatoid factors or human anti-mouse IgG antibodies (HAMA), helping to minimize interference from these factors. IgY obtained from egg yolk of hens immunized against <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> has been used in patients suffering from cystic fibrosis and chronic pulmonary colonization with this bacterium. Furthermore, IgY has been used to counteract <i>streptococcus mutans</i> in the oral cavity and for the treatment of enteral infections in both humans and animals. However, the use of avian antibodies is limited to pulmonary, enteral, or topical application and should, due to immunogenicity, not be used for systemic administration. Thus, IgY expands the range of strategies available for combating pathogens in medicine, as a promising candidate both as an alternative to antibiotics and as a valuable tool in research and diagnostics."

    "title": "Non-disruptive matrix turnover is a conserved feature of biofilm aggregate growth in paradigm pathogenic species.",
    "abstract": "Bacteria form multicellular aggregates called biofilms. A crucial component of these aggregates is a protective matrix that holds the community together. Biofilm matrix composition varies depending upon bacterial species but typically includes exopolysaccharides (EPS), proteins, and extracellular DNA. <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> is a model organism for the study of biofilms, and in non-mucoid biofilms, it uses the structurally distinct EPS Psl and Pel, the EPS-binding protein CdrA, and eDNA as key matrix components. An interesting phenomenon that we and others have observed is that the periphery of a biofilm aggregate can be EPS-rich and contain very few cells. In this study, we investigated two possible models of assembly and dynamics of this EPS-rich peripheral region: (i) newly synthesized EPS is inserted and incorporated into the existing EPS-rich region at the periphery during biofilm aggregate growth or (ii) EPS is continuously turned over and newly synthesized EPS is deposited at the outermost edge of the aggregate. Our results support the latter model. Specifically, we observed that new EPS is continually deposited at the aggregate periphery, which is necessary for continued aggregate growth but not aggregate stability. We made similar observations in another paradigm biofilm-forming species, <i>Vibrio cholerae</i>. This pattern of deposition raises the question of how EPS is retained. Specifically, for <i>P. aeruginosa</i> biofilms, the matrix adhesin CdrA is thought to retain EPS. However, current thinking is that cell-associated CdrA is responsible for this retention, and it is not clear how CdrA might function in the relatively cell-free aggregate periphery. We observed that CdrA is enzymatically degraded during aggregate growth without negatively impacting biofilm stability and that cell-free CdrA can partially maintain aggregation and Psl retention. Overall, this study shows that the matrix of <i>P. aeruginosa</i> biofilms undergoes both continuous synthesis of matrix material and matrix turnover to accommodate biofilm aggregate growth and that cell-free matrix can at least partially maintain biofilm aggregation and EPS localization. Furthermore, our similar observations for <i>V. cholerae</i> biofilms suggest that our findings may represent basic principles of aggregate assembly in bacteria. Here, we show that, to accommodate growing cellular biomass, newly produced Psl is deposited over existing Psl at the periphery of biofilm aggregates. We demonstrated that <i>V. cholerae</i> employs a similar mechanism with its biofilm matrix EPS, VPS. In addition, we found that the protease LasB is present in the biofilm matrix, resulting in degradation of CdrA to lower molecular weight cell-free forms. We then show that the released forms of CdrA are retained in the matrix and remain functional. Together, our findings support that the <i>P. aeruginosa</i> biofilm matrix is dynamic during the course of aggregate growth and that other species may employ similar mechanisms to remodel their matrix."

    "abstract": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a common autosomal recessive disease resulting from mutations of the gene that encodes the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). Although severe pulmonary neutrophilic inflammation is a primary pathologic feature of CF, more recent studies reveal a role for type 2 inflammation that is characterized by eosinophilia directed by both the innate and adaptive immune systems through ILC2 and CD4<sup>+</sup> Th2 cells, respectively. We have published that a clear type endotype exists within CF subjects stratified by Th2 inflammation, defined by increased obstructive pulmonary disease and a distinct phenotypic signature of increased allergic disease, infections, and burden of CF complications. Further, we showed an increased risk of death among CF subjects with type 2 inflammatory signatures compared to CF subjects lacking significant type 2 inflammation. The mechanisms of this heightened type 2 inflammatory signature in CF are still being defined, but it is clear that airway epithelial cells from CFTR-deficient mice have increased expression and release of IL-33, a key activator of ILC2 and Th2 cells, compared to persons with normal CFTR function. Further, there is strong evidence that CF regulates CD4<sup>+</sup> Th2 function in a cell-intrinsic fashion. These concepts are explored in this review article."

    "abstract": "Given the recent dramatic changes in medical therapy for cystic fibrosis (CF), this study aims to describe temporal changes in chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) and endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) rates. National Inpatient Sample (2004-2019; weighted estimates for 119,067 pediatric and 202,407 adult patients) was used to analyze adult (age ≥18 years) and pediatric patients with CF with pulmonary manifestations. Comorbid CRS, ESS rates, and extended length of stay (LOS, ≥75th percentile) were analyzed. The rate of CRS in both pediatric (14.1% vs 21.1%, <i>P</i> < .001) and adult (16.5% vs 40.9%, <i>P</i> < .001) patients increased. Rate of ESS in pediatric patients with CRS decreased from 25.3% to 3.4% (<i>P</i> < .001). A similar decline occurred in adults with CRS (12.3% vs 3.6%, <i>P</i> < .001). In multivariate analysis from 2015 to 2019, ESS and extended LOS were associated with admission in the Western United States (<i>P</i> < .001). CRS (OR 1.14, <i>P</i> = .002) and ESS (OR 1.78, <i>P</i> = .002) were independent predictors of extended LOS. Elective admission, primary insurance, race, and hospital teaching/location were significantly associated with ESS and extended LOS (<i>P</i> < .05). Despite the increased prevalence of CRS in adults and pediatric patients with CF, rates of inpatient ESS have declined from 2004 to 2019. Patient and hospital factors affect undergoing ESS in 2015 to 2019. CRS and ESS are associated with extended LOS in recent years."

    "abstract": "Lung cancer is uncommon among people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF). We describe the case of a 35-year-old man with mild, stable CF disease who presented with severe respiratory distress, systemic symptoms, elevated liver enzymes and hypereosinophilia along with a lung mass and pleural effusion. The patient was subsequently diagnosed with non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), featuring anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) translocation. Following treatment with a targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) there was a rapid tumor regression, however, his dyspnea and hypoxemia subsequently worsened. A trial of Elexacaftor/Tezacaftor/Ivacaftor (ETI) led to significant clinical improvement and enhanced pulmonary function. <i>In vitro</i> testing using patient-derived intestinal organoids was performed in parallel and also demonstrated a significant response to ETI. The deterioration observed following the initiation of ALK inhibitor treatment and subsequent improvement with CFTR modulators suggest that ALK inhibitor therapy may potentially impair CFTR activity. A better understanding of the relationship between these pathways could provide valuable insights and contribute to the development of more effective and tailored treatment strategies for patients with coexisting conditions<i>.</i> To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of ALK-translocated lung cancer in a CF patient, underscoring the necessity for a high degree of clinical suspicion in atypical presentations of pulmonary exacerbation and potentially linking ALK-EML4 activation pathways, TKI therapy and CFTR. Care for pwCF with lung cancer requires a unique multi-disciplinary approach to optimize their complex multifactorial treatment."

    "abstract": "Bronchiectasis is a chronic respiratory disease caused by various respiratory and systemic conditions. It is now considered a potentially reversible disease, particularly when diagnosed early and managed with appropriate respiratory care strategies. Although rare in children, it typically develops in patients with recurrent lower respiratory tract infections. The etiology of bronchiectasis in children differs from that in adults. This study aims to identify the clinical features, causes, and outcomes of non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis in children at a tertiary center. A retrospective review was conducted among children with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis who attended a university-affiliated hospital between January 2007 and December 2021. Clinical outcomes were assessed based on pulmonary function tests, exacerbation, and mortality. The study included 35 children with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis. The median age at diagnosis was 36 months (IQR: 24-170 months). Bronchiectasis was linked to underlying conditions in 22 cases (62.9%), such as primary immunodeficiency, chronic aspiration, and primary ciliary dyskinesia. Thirteen children had infectious-associated bronchiectasis (37.1%), with four cases related to pulmonary tuberculosis. At diagnosis, cystic bronchiectasis was most common (<i>n</i> = 17, 48.6%), followed by varicose (<i>n</i> = 13, 37.1%) and cylindrical bronchiectasis (<i>n</i> = 5, 14.3%). Pulmonary exacerbation occurred in 28 (80%) children, with a higher rate in noninfectious bronchiectasis than postinfectious bronchiectasis (90.9% vs 61.5%, <i>p</i> = 0.036). Hospitalization was required for 26 (77.1%) children, with a higher rate of noninfectious bronchiectasis than postinfectious bronchiectasis (86.3% vs 53.8%, <i>p</i> = 0.033). Primary immune deficiency and chronic aspiration are the most common non-infective causes of non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis. Noninfectious bronchiectasis leads to higher exacerbation and hospitalization rates."

    "abstract": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutation of the CFTR gene, encoding an epithelial anion channel. Here we evaluated the effect of the modulator combination elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor (ETI) on the function of four rare, poorly characterized CFTR variants: L383S, I507del, L1065P and R1066H. Intestinal organoids were obtained from subjects carrying the CFTR variants L383S, I507del, L1065P or R1066H in trans of a minimal function allele (class I mutation). Organoids and epithelial monolayers were used to assess the effect of ETI on CFTR protein abundance and CFTR-mediated chloride, bicarbonate, and fluid transport. In L383S-CFTR expressing cells, normal levels of fully glycosylated CFTR protein (C-band) were detected. In contrast, in I507del, L1065P or R1066H organoids, only partially glycosylated CFTR (B-band) was detected. Chloride/bicarbonate transport was severely impaired in epithelial monolayers prepared from these latter three variants, while anion transport of the L383S variant was affected to a moderate extent. ETI, but not ivacaftor alone, significantly enhanced CFTR-mediated chloride and bicarbonate transport in L1065P and R1066H monolayers, and stimulated fluid transport. A corresponding increase in the abundance of C-band protein was observed in both variants. ETI also modestly improved L383S-CFTR function, with a marginal effect on I507del-CFTR. The I507del, L1065P and R1066H variants display severely impaired function. ETI treatment markedly enhanced L1065P- and R1066HCFTR function, whereas its effect on L383S- CFTR was less pronounced. Consequently, ETI may ameliorate disease symptoms in individuals carrying the L1065P or R1066H variant. More tentative, it may also benefit those carrying the L383S variant."

    "abstract": "Cholelithiasis is increasing in the pediatric population, and there are currently no guidelines for the management of asymptomatic patients with both cholelithiasis and a predisposing condition. This study seeks to highlight situations where prophylactic cholecystectomy may be desirable. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of children who underwent elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy between October 2011 and September 2022. Thirty-two patients were included in the study. Five different groups of patients were identified based on associated pathologies. Twenty-six patients were symptomatic (81.25%), and six were asymptomatic (18.75%). All patients underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Hematologic and cystic fibrosis patients with asymptomatic cholelithiasis had a shorter length of hospital stay than patients with the same condition who progressed from asymptomatic to symptomatic gallstone disease. Consequently, patients with associated diseases (particularly hematologic diseases and cystic fibrosis) may benefit from early laparoscopic cholecystectomy, which could reduce the probability of surgical difficulties and shorten the length of hospital stay."

Comparing one-year prior to one-year on ETI therapy, significant improvements were noted in pulmonary exacerbations, hospital admissions, antibiotic courses, number of pwCF receiving daily chest therapy, dornase alfa and hypertonic saline in the total cohort and in all four subgroups (p < 0.05 for all). Though improvements were not dependent on genotype, we noted larger mean differences in ppFEV<sub>1</sub>, BMI, pulmonary exacerbations and antibiotic use in the group with more severe lung disease (ppFEV<sub>1</sub> <80 %) after one year of ETI therapy.

    "abstract": "Highly effective CFTR modulators, such as elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI), herald a new era in therapeutic strategy of cystic fibrosis (CF). ETI impact on glucose tolerance remains controversial. All the participants underwent a baseline oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) before ETI initiation (M0) and 12 months (M12), and at 24 months if possible. The cohort was stratified in two subgroups based on the baseline OGTT: normal glucose tolerance (NGT) and abnormal glucose tolerance (AGT) defined by impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance or diabetes not requiring insulin treatment. We included 106 adolescents with CF (age 14.1±1.5 years), 75 with NGT, 31 with AGT. The baseline characteristics of the two groups were similar except for a higher glucose level at 1 and 2-h OGTT in the AGT group. ETI induced an increase in BMIz-score and in Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1) (p<0.001). After 12 months, participants with NGT did not experience any change of 1-h and 2-h glucose. By contrast, those with AGT displayed a reduction of 2-h glucose at M12 (p=0.006). 15out of the 31 (48%) adolescents in the AGT group reversed to NGT but 9/75 (17%) in the NGT group progressed to AGT. 3 participants with CF related diabetes at baseline reversed to AGT. 1-hour glucose concentrations at or above 8.7 mmol/L (157mg/dL) during baseline OGTT had 80% sensitivity to identify those with AGT at 12 months (OR 1.51 [1.20, 1.92], p=0.001). 20 participants had a 24-month OGTT that confirmed preserved insulin secretion. ETI may improve glucose tolerance in adolescents with CF by preserving insulin secretion. 1-hour glucose during the OGTT helps to detect risk for AGT after ETI treatment."

    "abstract": "Obtaining sputum samples from people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF) for microbiology has become challenging due to the positive clinical effects of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator modulator therapy, elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor (ETI). Although ETI improves lung function and reduces sputum production, recent data shows that bacterial pathogens persist, making continued monitoring of infection important. As an alternative to sputum sampling, this study developed a non-invasive technique called 'Cough Breath' (CB) to identify volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) and link them to cystic fibrosis (CF) bacterial pathogens using purge and trap GC-MS. The CB culturing approach was able to isolate pathogens from expectorated particulates simultaneously with EBC collection; however, culturing positivity was low, with 6% of samples collected (<i>n</i>=47) positive for either <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> or <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>. From EBC, we identified VOCs matching those uniquely produced by <i>P. aeruginosa</i> (7), <i>S. aureus</i> (12), <i>Achromobacter xylosoxidans</i> (8) and <i>Granulicatella adiacens</i> (2); however, the overall detection rate was also low. Expanding to VOCs produced across multiple pathogens identified 30 frequently detected in the EBC of pwCF, including 2,3-pentanedione, propyl pyruvate, oxalic acid diallyl ester, methyl isobutyl ketone, methyl nitrate, 2-propenal, acetonitrile, acetoin and 2,3-butanedione. Comparing isolate volatilomes and EBC samples from the same pwCF enhanced detection rates with key VOCs, such as 2,3-pentanedione (86%) and propyl pyruvate (83%), in <i>P. aeruginosa</i> isolates. Further investigation showed that VOC production differed across strains and at different growth phases, creating variability that may explain the overall low EBC detection rate. Although this study successfully cultured CF pathogens from cough particulates and matched their unique VOCs in EBC samples, our results indicate that microbial volatiles more generally indicative of infection, such as 2,3-pentanedione, may have the most utility in aiding diagnostics in pwCF on ETI who have reduced sputum production in the clinic."

    "abstract": "To present the clinical characteristics and management outcomes of Coats disease with retinoschisis (retinal cyst). This was a retrospective review of 13 eyes from 13 consecutive Coats disease patients with retinal cyst. Clinical findings from multimodal ophthalmic imaging were recorded to characterize retinal cyst in Coats disease. All eyes were initially treated with endolaser photocoagulation combined with external drainage of cystic fluid and intravitreal ranibizumab injection. Patients were subsequently followed up to analyze anatomic and visual outcomes. All retinal cysts were associated with extensive retinal exudation; 3 eyes (23.1%) presented with exudative retinal detachment. A total of 92.3% (12/13) of the retinal cysts were located in the inferotemporal quadrant. Fluorescein angiography demonstrated telangiectasia surrounding and/or at the edge of the retinal cyst. Eleven eyes (84.6%) underwent endolaser photocoagulation via a nonvitrectomy approach, and 2 eyes (15.4%) underwent endolaser photocoagulation after vitrectomy due to the presence of epiretinal membrane. An average of 1.5 additional laser photocoagulation sessions was performed per patient. After a median follow-up of 23 months (range, 11-33 months), all eyes demonstrated retinal cyst resolution and no active disease. Subretinal fibrosis was observed in 9 eyes (69.2%); of these, 8 had macular subretinal nodules. In total, 30.8% of the eyes had a final vision ≥20/200. The presence of retinoschisis (retinal cyst) in Coats disease is strongly associated with retinal telangiectasia and exudation and is indicative of active vascular disease requiring effective ablative treatment. We propose a novel approach, endolaser photocoagulation combined with external drainage of cystic fluid and intravitreal ranibizumab injection, which was effective in achieving final anatomic improvement with retinal cyst resolution."

Using CF patient (F508del) derived <i>ex vivo</i> ileal and distal colonic/rectal enteroids as a model and the Forskolin Induced Swelling Assay (FIS), we compared CFTR mediated fluid secretion in human enterocytes across the crypt-villus axis. CFTR expression and FIS decreased as enterocytes differentiated from crypt to become partially differentiated and then mature villus cells . While there was no FIS response in undifferentiated (crypt enterocytes) F508del-CF enteroids, partially differentiated F508del-CF enteroids had a swelling response to forskolin (cAMP) and linaclotide (cGMP) which was ∼48%, and ∼67% of the response in healthy enteroids, respectively and was prevented by a CFTR inhibitor. Also, linaclotide and a general PDE inhibitor independently enhanced combined CFTR-modulator-induced FIS response from partially differentiated F508del-CF enteroids. These findings demonstrate that partially differentiated ileal and distal colonic F508del-CFTR enteroids can be stimulated to secrete fluid by cAMP and cGMP."

    "abstract": "Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) studies identified a novel subpopulation of epithelial cells along the rostrocaudal axis of human intestine specifically marked by bestrophin 4 (BEST4) that are enriched for genes regulating pH, GPCR acid-sensing receptors, satiety, cGMP signaling, HCO3<sup>-</sup> secretion, ion transport, neuropeptides, and paracrine hormones. Interestingly, BEST4+ cells in the proximal small intestine express CFTR but have not been linked to the previously described CFTR High Expresser Cell (CHE) subpopulation in rat and human intestine. ScRNA-seq studies in rat jejunum identified CHEs and a gene expression profile consistent with human small intestinal BEST4+ and neuropod cells. Protein immunolocalization confirmed that CHEs express CFTR, BEST4, neuropod proteins, high levels of intracellular uroguanylin (UGN), guanylyl cyclase-C (GC-C), and the proton channel otopetrin 2 (OTOP2), and display long basal processes connecting to neurons. OTOP2, GC-C, and CFTR traffic robustly into the apical domain of CHEs in response to acidic luminal conditions, indicating their roles in luminal pH regulation. In the ΔF508 cystic fibrosis (CF) rat jejunum, the loss of apical CFTR did not affect BEST4 protein expression in CHEs. However, there was an increased abundance of CHE cells in the ΔF508 rat jejunum compared to wild-type animals. Furthermore, ΔF508 rat CHEs expressed higher levels of GC-C at the apical domain compared to wild-type. These data implicate CHEs in intestinal CF disease pathogenesis. This is the first study to identify CFTR High Expresser cells in the rat small intestine as neuropod cells capable of sensing and responding to luminal pH. This study also provides the first characterization of CFTR and relevant mRNA and proteins in CHEs in CF rat models that provide insights into the significance of CHEs to CF intestinal disease."

    "abstract": "Ageing of the cardiovascular system is associated with frailty and various life-threatening diseases. As global populations grow older, age-related conditions increasingly determine healthspan and lifespan. The circulatory system not only supplies nutrients and oxygen to all tissues of the human body and removes by-products but also builds the largest interorgan communication network, thereby serving as a gatekeeper for healthy ageing. Therefore, elucidating organ-specific and cell-specific ageing mechanisms that compromise circulatory system functions could have the potential to prevent or ameliorate age-related cardiovascular diseases. In support of this concept, emerging evidence suggests that targeting the circulatory system might restore organ function. In this Roadmap, we delve into the organ-specific and cell-specific mechanisms that underlie ageing-related changes in the cardiovascular system. We raise unanswered questions regarding the optimal design of clinical trials, in which markers of biological ageing in humans could be assessed. We provide guidance for the development of gerotherapeutics, which will rely on the technological progress of the diagnostic toolbox to measure residual risk in elderly individuals. A major challenge in the quest to discover interventions that delay age-related conditions in humans is to identify molecular switches that can delay the onset of ageing changes. To overcome this roadblock, future clinical trials need to provide evidence that gerotherapeutics directly affect one or several hallmarks of ageing in such a manner as to delay, prevent, alleviate or treat age-associated dysfunction and diseases."

    "abstract": "Common indications to evaluate exocrine pancreatic function in children include chronic diarrhea, steatorrhea, failure to thrive, cystic fibrosis and those with chronic abdominal pain due to chronic pancreatitis where imaging studies are normal [1]. Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency (EPI) has a spectrum of severity. In children often remains an underdiagnosed condition, particularly in its mild, partial, and isolated enzyme deficiency forms. The purpose of this review is to help understand the different varieties of EPI including isolated pancreatic enzyme deficiencies as possible causes of malnutrition and growth failure in pediatric patients. Among the indirect diagnostic methods, the fecal elastase-1 (FE-1) testing is the most widely used one. While it has good sensitivity and specificity in severe pancreatic damage, like cystic fibrosis in children, its performance in the diagnosis of mild, partial, and isolated enzyme deficiencies is poor. Direct pancreatic function testing performed during endoscopy (ePFT), has emerged as a more sensitive and specific method for assessing all forms of exocrine pancreatic function. Notably, recent guidelines from the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition (NASPGHAN) emphasize the importance of ePFT in pediatric patients. Most of the pediatric practitioners taught that the pancreas has only two diseases, cystic fibrosis and pancreatitis. They are missing the fact that pancreas, like other digestive organs, can have different, many times secondary, dysfunctions that influence the growth of children. Most pediatric gastroenterologists still use the fecal elastase-1 (FE-1) test, however, this lacks sufficient specificity and sensitivity [2-5] especially in patients with mild or early pancreatic disease or those with isolated enzyme deficiencies [5]. The most accurate diagnostic modality to explore these conditions is ePFT. In this review we highlighted the critical importance of direct pancreatic function testing. Enhancing clinical awareness and incorporating direct testing methods can ultimately improve outcomes for affected children."

This study aimed to analyze the possibility of detecting CF pulmonary exacerbations (PEx) at home using an AI-aided stethoscope (AIS). In a six-month study, 129 CF patients (85 children, 44 adults) used AIS for at least weekly self-examinations, recording various parameters: wheezes, rhonchi, crackles intensity, respiratory and heart rate, and inspiration-to-expiration ratio. Health state surveys were also completed. Physicians evaluated 5160 examinations to identify PEx. Machine learning models were trained using those parameters, and AUCs were calculated for PEx detection. 522 self-examinations were diagnosed clinically as exacerbated. AI-aided home stethoscopes detected 415 exacerbated self-examinations (sensitivity 79.5 % at specificity 89.1 %). Among the single-parameter discriminators, coarse crackles intensity exhibited an AUC of 70 % (95% CI: 65-75) for young children, fine crackles intensity demonstrated an AUC of 75 % (95 % CI: 72-78) for older children, and an AUC of 93 % (95 % CI: 92-93) was achieved for adults using fine crackles intensity. The combination of parameters yielded the highest efficacy, with AUC exceeding 83% for objective parameters from the AI module alone and exceeding 90 % when incorporating both objective and subjective parameters across all groups. The AI-aided home stethoscope has proven to be a reliable tool for detecting PEx with greater accuracy than self-assessment alone. Implementing this technology in healthcare systems has the potential to provide valuable insights for timely intervention and management of PExes."

Biofilm experiments were carried out in a flow cell system and images were acquired using a confocal laser microscope (CLSM) on days 3 and 5. Four experiments were performed: Experiment 1 with two clonal isolates from sinus and lungs from patient P01 (CF430-142, CF430-11621); experiments 2 (CF430-11621 + 75885-B) and 3 (CF430-11621 + 80271-B) with two lung isolates belonging to two different clones from different patients (P02, P03) and experiment 4 with one lung strain (CF430-11621) and <i>P. aeruginosa</i> PAO1 reference strain. <i>P. aeruginosa</i> clonal isolates coming from paranasal sinuses and lungs from the same patient were able to form mixed biofilm. When different clones were employed no mixed biofilms were observed. Similar results were observed when combining the lung strain and the reference strain PAO1. Biofilms of both strains were observed in the flow-cell channels but no mixed biofilms of them were observed, with the exception of strain 75887-B which did not appear to form any biofilm when mixed with strain CF430-11621. All strains performed swarming while strains CF430-142 and 75887B lacked twitching motility. An aminoacidic change in SadB was observed in the strain 75887B. Mixed biofilms were only observed when identical clones from the same patient were cultured together. Our experiments indicate that twitching motility does not significantly affect biofilm formation or architecture in our isolates."

    "abstract": "Post-tuberculosis lung disease (PTLD) is a precursor to Aspergillus-related lung diseases. While Chronic Pulmonary Aspergillosis (CPA) has been extensively studied in the background of tuberculosis, Allergic Bronchopulmonary Aspergillosis (ABPA) has been reported sporadically with limited information on its prevalence, clinical-radiological features, and treatment outcomes. This study, conducted in a high TB burden setting, aimed to address this knowledge gap by systematically evaluating ABPA in PTLD patients. This retrospective cohort study screened PTLD patients presenting with respiratory or constitutional symptoms persisting for more than 3 months. The objective was to report the prevalence, clinical-radiological-laboratory data, and outcomes of ABPA-PTLD compared to a cohort of CPA (CPA-PTLD) and patients with PTLD (PTLD only). Out of a total of 1012 PTLD patients, ABPA was seen in 2.27%, CPA in 20.75% and Aspergillus sensitization in 0.7%. ABPA patients primarily presented with breathlessness (91.3%) and cough (82.6%) while haemoptysis (43.5%), weight loss (13%), and anorexia (21.7%) were also observed, albeit less commonly than in CPA-PTLD. Bronchiectasis (100%) and nodules (87%) were more frequent in ABPA-PTLD patients, whereas consolidation (21.7%), cavities (30.4%), pleural thickening (8.7%), and 'fungal ball' (9.1%) were also seen, although less commonly than in CPA-PTLD. Most patients received azoles (78%) as first-line therapy, with symptomatic improvement (partial/complete) observed in ~78%. ABPA may occur in PTLD patients, with specific clinical (e.g., haemoptysis) and radiological (e.g., cavity and fungal ball) features uncommon in other types of ABPA, but resembling other PTLD conditions. Future studies should focus on identifying differences in the natural course and appropriate treatment paradigms of ABPA-PTLD patients compared to ABPA occurring in asthma and cystic fibrosis patients."

    "abstract": "Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (SDS) is characterized by neutropenia, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, and bony abnormalities with an increased risk of myeloid neoplasia. Almost all cases of SDS result from biallelic mutations in Shwachman-Bodian-Diamond syndrome (SBDS). SBDS interacts with elongation factor-like 1 (EFL1) to displace eukaryotic initiation factor 6 (EIF6) from the 60S ribosomal subunit. Released EIF6 permits the assembly of ribosomal large and small subunits in the cytoplasm. Decreased EIF6 levels due to haploinsufficiency or missense mutations, which lead to decreased protein expression, may provide a somatic genetic rescue and antileukemic effects. We observed accumulation of EIF6 protein in sbds-KO zebrafish models, confirmed this accumulation in patient-derived tissues, and correlated these with changes in ribosomal proteins and tumor protein p53 (TP53) pathways. The mechanism of action for this adaptive response is unknown. To address this, we generated eif6-KO zebrafish, which do not survive more than 10 days after fertilization. We also created 2 mutants with low Eif6 expression, i.e., 5%-25% of WT levels, that could survive until adulthood. We bred them with sbds-null strains and analyzed their phenotype and biochemical properties. Low Eif6 levels reduced Tp53 pathway activation but did not rescue neutropenia in Sbds-deficient zebrafish. Further studies elucidating the interplay between SBDS, EIF6, and TP53 and cellular stress responses offer promising insights into SDS pathogenesis, somatic genetic rescue, and therapeutic strategies."

We conducted an observational, prospective, multicentre study including 108 patients over 18 years old who initiated ETI therapy between December 2019 and December 2023. Patients underwent regular evaluations, including clinical, functional, and microbiological assessments, alongside completion of quality of life, anxiety, and depression questionnaires. We evaluated whether there was a difference in anxiety and depression levels over time. After 12 months of treatment, significant improvements were noted in BMI, lung function (FEV1%), ST and various aspects of quality of life (CFQ-R). However, anxiety and depression levels did not differ significantly during the follow-up. When we stratified our sample by key groups, we observed that younger patients (under 28 years) and those with homozygous Phe508del mutations experienced significant higher anxiety with no differences on depression. Furthermore, anxiety and depression demonstrated a moderate correlation, strengthening over time. Treatment with ETI establishes significant improvements in lung function, BMI, ST and quality of life in patients with CF. However, despite these positive outcomes, there were no significant changes observed in levels of anxiety and depression, except for individuals with homozygous mutation type and those younger than 28 years old, who exhibited significant higher levels of anxiety."

    "abstract": "Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a life-limiting, inherited condition in which a novel class of oral medicine, CFTR modulators, has revolutionised symptoms and health indicators, providing an opportunity to evaluate traditional treatment regimens with the hope of reducing burden. Additionally, there is cautious optimism that life expectancy for people with CF born today could ultimately compare to that of the general population. Given this potential, there is a need and requirement to optimise treatment to balance burden with the best clinical outcomes for each person with CF in an individualised manner. Personalised data-Linkage to Understand Treatment Optimisation (PLUTO) is a clinical framework, developed within the 14-Centre UK CFHealthHub Learning Health System collaborative, designed for use at an individual level for people with CF taking CFTR modulators. The PLUTO framework encourages use of two routinely collected clinical outcome measure (FEV1 and BMI) to determine health status. Where FEV1 or BMI trends suggest that optimal health outcomes are not being achieved for a person with CF, PLUTO supports consideration of adherence to both CFTR modulators and inhaled therapy to help guide the next steps. PLUTO is designed to support people with CF and their clinical teams to individualise care and optimise outcomes for those taking CFTR modulators, using data available in routine clinical encounters."

    "title": "Thoracoabdominal Normothermic Regional Perfusion and Donation After Circulatory Death Lung Use.",
    "abstract": "Donation after circulatory death (DCD) heart procurement has increased, but concerns remain about the effect of simultaneous heart and lung procurement, particularly with thoracoabdominal normothermic regional perfusion (TA-NRP), on the use of DCD lungs. Previous analyses exclude critical donor factors and organ nonuse, and rapidly rising DCD use may bias comparisons to historical controls. To use validated risk-adjusted models to assess whether DCD heart procurement via TA-NRP and direct procurement is associated with lung use. This retrospective cohort study involved adult DCD donors between January 1, 2019, and September 30, 2024, listed in the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (SRTR). The SRTR deceased donor yield model was used to develop an observed to expected (O:E) yield ratio of lung use obtained through DCD among 4 cohorts: cardiac DCD donors vs noncardiac DCD donors and cardiac DCD donors undergoing TA-NRP vs direct procurement. Temporal trends in O:E ratios were analyzed with the Cochran-Armitage test. The O:E ratios of DCD lung use. Among 24 431 DCD donors (15 878 [65.0%] male; median [IQR] age, 49.0 [37.0-58.0] years), 22 607 were noncardiac DCD (14 375 [63.6%] male; median [IQR] age, 51.0 [39.0-58.0] years) and 1824 were cardiac DCD (1503 [82.4%] male; median [IQR] age, 32.0 [26.0-38.0] years) donors; noncardiac DCD donors were more likely to be smokers (6873 [30.4%] vs 227 [12.4%]; P < .001). Among cardiac DCD donors, 325 underwent TA-NRP, while 712 underwent direct procurement. TA-NRP donors had shorter median (IQR) lung ischemic times (6.07 [4.38-9.56] hours vs 8.12 [6.16-12.00] hours; P < .001) and distances to recipient hospitals (222 [9-626] nautical miles vs 331 [159-521] nautical miles; P = .050) than direct procurement donors. Lung use was higher among cardiac DCD donations compared with noncardiac DCD donations (16.7% vs 4.4%, P < .001). Within the cardiac DCD cohort, lung use was similar between TA-NRP and direct procurement (19.1% vs 18.7%; P = .88) cohorts. Both noncardiac DCD and cardiac DCD donors had observed lung yields greater than expected (O:E, 1.29 [95% CI, 1.21-1.35] and 1.79 [95% CI, 1.62-1.96]; both P < .001), although cardiac DCD yield was significantly higher than noncardiac DCD yield (P < .001). Both TA-NRP and direct procurement lung yields were greater than expected (O:E, 2.00 [95% CI, 1.60-2.43] and 1.77 [95% CI, 1.52-1.99]; both P < .001) but were not significantly different from each other (P = .83). The O:E ratios did not change significantly over time across all cohorts. Among recipients, the TA-NRP cohort experienced significantly better 90-day mortality (0 of 62 vs 9 of 128 patients [7.0%]; P = .03) and overall survival (4 of 62 patients [6.5%] vs 21 of 128 patients [16.4%]; P = .04) rates compared with the direct procurement cohort. In this cohort study of DCD donors, concomitant heart procurement provided better-than-expected rates of lung use as assessed with validated O:E use ratios regardless of procurement technique. The findings also suggest a survival benefit with improved 90-day and overall survival rates for the TA-NRP cohort compared with the direct procurement cohort. Policies should be developed to maximize the benefits of these donations."

    "title": "Identification of nonsense-mediated decay inhibitors that alter the tumor immune landscape.",
    "abstract": "Despite exciting developments in cancer immunotherapy, its broad application is limited by the paucity of targetable antigens on the tumor cell surface. As an intrinsic cellular pathway, nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) conceals neoantigens through the destruction of the RNA products from genes harboring truncating mutations. We developed and conducted a high-throughput screen, based on the ratiometric analysis of transcripts, to identify critical mediators of NMD in human cells. This screen implicated disruption of kinase SMG1's phosphorylation of UPF1 as a potential disruptor of NMD. This led us to design a novel SMG1 inhibitor, KVS0001, that elevates the expression of transcripts and proteins resulting from human and murine truncating mutations in vitro and murine cells in vivo. Most importantly, KVS0001 concomitantly increased the presentation of immune-targetable human leukocyte antigens (HLA) class I-associated peptides from NMD-downregulated proteins on the surface of human cancer cells. KVS0001 provides new opportunities for studying NMD and the diseases in which NMD plays a role, including cancer and inherited diseases."

TH was initially described as well-accepted by both clinicians and patients. As we move past the unusual circumstances of the pandemic, the sustainability of TH remains untested. This study sought to test the durability of clinician perceptions of TH post-pandemic. This is a cross-sectional, survey study of clinicians at seven US CF centers. We refined a previously disseminated survey initially designed to assess clinician perceptions of TH in 2020. Survey results were analyzed using descriptive statistics and current responses were compared to prior results. Clinician perceptions surrounding TH remain high but have changed over time with 75% now endorsing satisfaction (90% in 2020, p = 0.02). The most cited barriers were technology limitations (68%) and limited in-person assessments (66%). We found a significant decrease in concern over missing in-person assessments compared to 2020. Benefits of TH included convenience for patients and families (100%) and reduction in missed days of school or work (100%). In total, 83% of current respondents felt TH should remain part of routine CF care. A majority indicated certain patient characteristics increased their preference to conduct at least one TH visit per year. Despite restoration of full access to in-person care, clinicians caring for pwCF continue to use TH across the surveyed CF centers post-pandemic. Respondents continue to view TH favorably. Further study is needed to understand for which patient and clinical scenarios TH is most appropriate."

    "abstract": "1,2,4-Oxadiazoles are well recognized for their exceptional physical, chemical, and pharmacokinetic properties, making them promising candidates for various therapeutic applications. These include treatments for cystic fibrosis, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Alzheimer's disease, and a broad spectrum of other therapeutic interventions such as antituberculosis, anticancer, antibiotic, anti-inflammatory, and anticonvulsant activities. In this study, single crystals of a novel 1,2,4-oxadiazole derivative, methyl-4-(5-(4-(octyloxy)phenyl)-1,2,4-oxadiazol-3-yl)benzoate, were grown by a slow evaporation technique. The structural elucidation was performed using X-ray diffraction analysis, confirming the compound's crystalline structure in the triclinic system. The analysis revealed a linear conformation with bond lengths closely aligned with Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) averages, signifying high precision in the molecular structure. A detailed CSD study identified nine principal configurations of the phenyl octyloxy moiety, underscoring the structural diversity of the compound. Hirshfeld surface analysis highlighted the predominance of C-H···O and C-H···π interactions, with dispersion energy playing a critical role in stabilizing the crystal lattice. Docking studies against key microbial targets, particularly <i>E. coli</i> FabH, demonstrated superior binding energies, suggesting significant antimicrobial potential. The comprehensive suite of structural and computational analyses underscores the potential of the synthesized 1,2,4-oxadiazole derivative, which may be one of the promising candidates for antimicrobial drug development. Future <i>in vitro</i>, <i>in vivo</i> studies will be supportive in optimizing the derivative for enhanced efficacy and further elucidating its pharmacological mechanisms, paving the way for potential clinical applications. This study not only provides insights into the structural and functional properties of a novel 1,2,4-oxadiazole derivative but also highlights its promising role in antimicrobial drug discovery."

This systematic review aims to comprehensively evaluate the quality of CPGs for CF and its pulmonary complications, focusing on treatment recommendations for pulmonary care. We conducted a comprehensive search across four databases and relevant websites to identify eligible guidelines providing treatment recommendations. The quality of these guidelines was assessed using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II tool. Pulmonary treatment recommendations were analyzed and synthesized narratively. A total of 35 guidelines were identified. Most guidelines were of moderate quality according to the AGREE II instrument, with overall scores ranging from 21·05 to 76·13. Only six guidelines were recommended for use. These guidelines provide 359 pulmonary treatment recommendations for seven primary therapies and others. There was inconsistency in the use of airway clearance therapy, anti-inflammatories, antibiotics, inhaled drugs, and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator modulator therapy. Four guidelines conditionally advocated for oral corticosteroids, while six opposed routine inhaled corticosteroids. One guideline discouraged lumacaftor-ivacaftor in the general CF population, two recommended only for children under 12 years old, and another strongly advocated for children between 2 and 5 years of age. However, one guideline noted a lack of evidence to recommend it for children under 6. The quality of CPGs for CF and its pulmonary complications has improved over time, reaching a moderate level generally, but there is still room for further improvement. Future efforts should focus on standardizing methodological frameworks and generating robust clinical evidence to enhance the overall quality and applicability of CF guidelines."

    "abstract": "In individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF), respiratory viral infections frequently result in hospitalization and have been linked to secondary bacterial infection and colonization, highlighting viral infections as possible contributors to CF lung disease progression. We hypothesized that expression of antiviral host defense genes is dysregulated in CF airway epithelia. We infected primary CF and Non-CF airway epithelia with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and characterized their responses at 12 hr, 24 hr, 48 hr, 72 hr, and 120 hr post infection (hpi) by RNA sequencing (RNAseq). Our analysis revealed strikingly different gene expression profiles for the CF and Non-CF epithelia over the course of the infection. While both CF and Non-CF cells exhibited an early signature for interferon signaling and antiviral defense pathways, this response was relatively exaggerated and sustained in CF epithelia. We also observed, in both genotypes, a transient downregulation of cilia-associated genes and loss of ciliary activity by 72 hpi. Interestingly, recovery of cilia activity was delayed in the CF epithelia. These findings further our understanding of innate immune dysfunction in the CF airway epithelium and suggest that virus-induced cilia injury may further compromise host defenses in CF airways."

CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulator therapy, most recently Elexacaftor/Tezacaftor/Ivacaftor (ETI), has led to improved CFTR function and life expectancy. However, the rising prevalence of obesity in adults is concerning. This study assessed the micro- and macrovascular endothelial function, cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, and physical activity (PA) profiles in people with CF (pwCF) on ETI compared to healthy matched controls. In 15 pwCF and 15 age- and sex-matched controls, microvascular endothelial function (via transdermal delivery of insulin [INS] and acetylcholine [ACh] on the forearm), macrovascular endothelial function (via flow-mediated dilation [FMD] of the brachial artery), central haemodynamic parameters, including heart rate (HR), stroke volume index (SVi) and cardiac output index (Q̇I) (via thoracic impedance cardiography), body mass index (BMI), blood pressure (BP), and accelerometer-assessed PA were measured. There were no differences in INS or FMD-mediated vasodilation between the groups (P > 0.05). However, a reduced vasodilatory response was evident in pwCF following ACh-mediated vasodilation (P = 0.01) and FMD normalised for shear rate (P = 0.03). No differences in resting HR, SVi, Q̇I, BP, BMI or PA were found (P > 0.05). This study demonstrated reduced micro- and macrovascular function in pwCF.

The primary objective was to determine the prevalence of steatosis, by magnetic resonance-proton density fat fraction (MR-PDFF), and liver fibrosis, by magnetic resonance elastography (MRE), in a cohort of adults with cystic fibrosis. The secondary objective was to determine the diagnostic yield of widely available non-invasive liver markers for steatosis and fibrosis, and vibration controlled transitional elastography (VCTE) releasing Control Attenuation Parameter (CAP) (dB/m) and stiffness (kPa), with the aim of proposing a diagnostic algorithm. We conducted a cross-sectional study including 101 adult patients with cystic fibrosis seen in a multidisciplinary unit. The study encompassed a clinical evaluation, morpho-functional assessment, VCTE, non-invasive liver markers and MR-PDFF and MRE. Diagnostic accuracy was assessed using ROC curves and 2 × 2 tables. MR-PDFF detected hepatic steatosis in 18 of 101 (17.8 %) patients, while MRE detected significant liver fibrosis in 15 of 101 (14.9 %). The VCTE cut-off with the best diagnostic yield, determined by the Youden index, was 222 dB/m for the presence of steatosis (AUC 0.864 (95 % CI 0.768-0.961; p < 0.001) and the VCTE cut-off was 6.65 kPa for liver fibrosis (AUC 0.951(95 % CI 0.81-1; p = 0.053). A screening algorithm for hepatic steatosis was developed using the fatty liver index (FLI) and CAP, with a negative predictive value of 83.3 %. For liver fibrosis, it was outperformed by the Hepamet Fibrosis Score (HFS) and VCTE, with a negative predictive value of 100 %. The prevalence of hepatic steatosis and liver fibrosis was 17.8 % and 14.9 %, respectively. VCTE alone or in combination with FLI for steatosis or HFS for fibrosis demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy. This approach effectively allows for the exclusion of steatosis and fibrosis, thereby reducing the need for MR-PDFF and MRE studies."

These conditions can significantly affect child's well-being, leading to physical limitations, psychological distress, and social isolation. We aimed to evaluate the available data on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in pediatric patients with IF and without neurodevelopmental delay. For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched CINAHL, EMBASE, PsycINFO, PubMed, and Web of Science. All observational studies of pediatric patients (< 18 years) with IF which measured HRQOL and with evidence of absence of neurodevelopmental delay were included, without language or date restrictions, up to June 2024. We did separate random-effects meta-analyses for overall HRQOL and subgroup domains. Evidence from observational studies was synthesised as differences between standardised mean differences (SMDs) for all subgroup domains. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I² statistic and the Cochran Q test. The quality of the evidence was assessed with the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. This study is registered on PROSPERO, number CRD42024561812. Of 491 records identified, 14 were eligible and data were available for 12 studies, all of which had a fair/good quality. The included studies involved a pooled sample of 510 participants (mean age = 7.0 ± 3.6 years). The analysis disclosed that compared to healthy children, pediatric patients with IF had lower overall quality of life in both child- and parent-report (Standardized Mean Difference [SMD]= -0.62; 95% CI [-0.80, -0.43]; p < 0.001, and SMD= -0.70; 95% CI [-1.11, -0.28]; p < 0.001, respectively), except for emotional and social domains (SMD[child] = -0.23; 95% CI [ -0.38, -0.08]; p = 0.001 Vs SMD[parent]= -0.23; 95% CI [ -0.60, 0.14]; p = 0.21, and SMD[child] = -0.40; 95% CI [ -0.70, -0.10]; p = 0.007 Vs SMD[parent]= -0.24; 95% CI [ -0.62, 0.14]; p = 0.21, respectively), where parents overestimate emotional and social HRQOL of their children.

    "abstract": "Non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis (NCFBE) is a disease that exhibits dilatation of airways, airflow obstruction, persistent cough, excessive sputum production, and refractory respiratory infections. NCFBE exhibits clinical and pathological manifestations similar to key features of cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease. In CF, pathogenesis results from dysfunction of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), and diagnosis is made by demonstrating elevated sweat chloride concentrations (typically ≥60 mEq/L), two CFTR mutations known to be causal, multi-organ tissue injury, or combination(s) of these findings. Based on a considerable body of evidence, we believe many patients with NCFBE have disease likely to benefit from drugs such as elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI) that activate CFTR-dependent ion transport. ETI is currently prescribed solely for treatment of CF and has not been adequately tested or proposed for patients with NCFBE, many of whom exhibit decreased CFTR function. Accordingly, we are conducting a clinical trial of ETI in subjects carrying a diagnosis of NCFBE. Participants will exhibit one disease-causing CFTR mutation and/or sweat chloride measurements of 30-59 mEq/L. Cutaneous punch biopsy or blood samples will be obtained for iPS cell differentiation into airway epithelial monolayers-which will then be tested for response to ETI. Each patient will be given CFTR modulator treatment for approximately four weeks, with monitoring of clinical endpoints that include FEV1 (forced expiratory volume in one second), sweat chloride, quality of life questionnaire, and weight. The study will evaluate response of patients with NCFBE to ETI, and test usefulness of iPSC-derived airway epithelial monolayers as a novel in vitro technology for predicting clinical benefit. This trial is registered at clinicaltrials.gov (Identifier: NCT05743946. Date: 02/23/2023)."

This retrospective cohort study of live-born infants included in the National Inpatient Sample from January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2020, used survey weighting methods to estimate the national incidence of MRO by etiology. Data were analyzed from November 27, 2023, to November 12, 2024. MRO. The primary outcome was diagnosis with MRO. Secondary outcomes included mortality, need for abdominal surgery, hospitalization duration, and cost. Multivariable regression models were developed to evaluate characteristics associated with MRO and to assess the association of MRO of prematurity with clinical outcomes after adjusting for demographic and clinical covariates. Of 3 550 796 infants, 51.2% were male and 46.7% were privately insured. Overall, 9.1% (n = 322 499) were born preterm. Of 1844 (0.1%) infants treated for MRO, 41 (2.2%) had cystic fibrosis, 60 (3.3%) had Hirschsprung disease, and 1743 (94.5%) had neither predisposing condition. Preterm infants were at highest risk for MRO, with 4.7 MRO cases per 100 000 births associated with cystic fibrosis, 4.7 MRO cases per 100 000 births associated with Hirschsprung disease, and 187.3 MRO cases per 100 000 births associated with neither predisposing condition. Among infants with neither cystic fibrosis nor Hirschsprung disease, those with gestational ages from 28 weeks to 31 weeks 6 days were most likely to develop MRO compared with term infants (adjusted odds ratio, 6.08 [95% CI, 4.27-8.67]). Among preterm infants, having an MRO was associated with a 4.2 percentage point increase in the probability of abdominal surgery (95% CI, 3.1-5.4 percentage points), a 7.3-day increase in length of stay (95% CI, 5.8-8.8 days), and a $23 215 increase in hospitalization costs (95% CI, $17 739-$28 690) compared with infants who did not have an obstruction, with no change in mortality rate (0.1 percentage point change [95% CI, -0.6 to 0.8 percentage points]). In this cohort study of over 3.5 million infants, MRO was most likely to occur among preterm infants without cystic fibrosis or Hirschsprung disease. These infants more frequently required surgery and had longer and more costly hospitalizations, indicating a need for dedicated prevention and treatment pathways for this understudied disease."

    "abstract": "Phenotypic diversity in bacteria often results from adaptation to changing environmental conditions, exemplified by variable colony morphotypes. In <i>Burkholderia pseudomallei</i>, discrete genomic alterations and modulation of gene expression facilitate adaptation. Adapted variants of species within the <i>Burkholderia cepacia</i> complex (Bcc) often lose the pC3 virulence megaplasmid, impacting their colony morphology and their production of virulence factors. In this study, we characterize variants arising in <i>Burkholderia ambifaria</i> clinical isolates using proteomics and phenotypic tests and show that some of them have retained the pC3, indicating a distinct phase variation mechanism at play in this Bcc species. Interestingly, variants of <i>B. ambifaria</i> strains CEP0996 (pC3-null) and HSJ1 (pC3-positive) still share similarities in phenotypes controlled by the Cep quorum-sensing (QS) system. We further investigated the role of QS in <i>B. ambifaria</i> HSJ1 phase variation and confirmed that the Cep QS system is important for the emergence of variants. Given that DNA methylation is a key epigenetic factor regulating virulence factors in <i>Burkholderia cenocepacia</i>, we hypothesized that adenosine DNA methylation also governs phase variation in <i>B. ambifaria</i> HSJ1. By deleting the genes encoding putative adenosine DNA methyltransferases, we discovered that an orphan type II DNA methyltransferase inhibits the emergence of phase variants. This study is the first to demonstrate that quorum sensing and adenosine DNA methylation are two antagonistic systems independently controlling phase variation in <i>B. ambifaria</i>.IMPORTANCESome <i>Burkholderia</i> species are pathogenic to plants, animals, or humans. In immunocompromised individuals, and people suffering from cystic fibrosis, infection from the <i>Burkholderia cepacia</i> complex (Bcc) can lead to \"<i>cepacia</i> syndrome.\" In northern Australia and southeast Asia, melioidosis caused by <i>Burkholderia pseudomallei</i> is prevalent among native population, particularly among people with diabetes, chronic lung or kidney disease or alcoholism. <i>Burkholderia</i>'s phenotypic plasticity, including colony morphotype variation (CMV), enables rapid adaptation to diverse environments, enhancing its survival and pathogenicity. This study reveals phase variation as a new CMV mechanism within the Bcc group and is the first to report that quorum sensing and DNA methylation are involved in phase variation. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of CMV could lead to the development of targeted therapies against these highly antibiotic-tolerant bacteria."

    "abstract": "Patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) frequently require modulatory therapies such as Lumacaftor/Ivacaftor (LI) and Elexacaftor/Tezacaftor/Ivacaftor (ETI) to manage their condition. Given the potential hepatic complications associated with CF, it is critical to understand the impact of these therapies on liver function and fibrosis indices. This study aimed to evaluate the changes in liver function markers and fibrosis indices in CF patients undergoing LI and ETI therapies, with a specific focus on the influence of underlying hepatic disease. In this retrospective analysis, liver function markers and fibrosis indices were assessed in CF patients receiving ETI (n=24), LI (n=4), or LI transitioned to ETI (LI/ETI, n=8). Key liver function markers, including alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), bilirubin, platelet count, and fibrosis indices (APRI and FIB-4), were measured at baseline and at various time points up to 12 months. In patients receiving LI therapy, ALT and AST levels demonstrated a slight but non-significant decrease over six months, accompanied by significant fluctuations in total bilirubin levels. Among those receiving ETI therapy, ALT and AST levels initially increased but stabilized over time, while total bilirubin levels significantly increased from baseline to 12 months. No significant differences were observed in liver function markers between patients with and without hepatic disease under ETI therapy. Trends in fibrosis indices (APRI and FIB-4) were modest and largely non-significant across both therapies. ETI therapy appears to be safe for CF patients, including those with pre-existing hepatic disease, with no significant deterioration in liver function over a 12-month period. However, the observed fluctuations in bilirubin levels underscore the necessity for ongoing monitoring. Further research is warranted to investigate the long-term hepatic effects of LI and ETI therapies."

It is a prevalent infection in developing countries like Bolivia, Peru, and Egypt, affecting both humans and livestock. It remains under-reported due to lack of awareness. Humans accidentally acquire it by consuming contaminated watercress or water contaminated with infective metacercaria. It affects the hepatobiliary system, manifesting as tender hepatomegaly, bile duct obstruction, liver fibrosis, and secondary cholangitis. Diagnosing fascioliasis is a challenge as it presents with nonspecific symptoms like prolonged fever, anorexia, ascites, and with limited availability of testing. Triclabendazole, currently the only approved drug, is unavailable in India. Fascioliasis has been reported only in reports from India. We here report a case of a 4-year-old patient who presented with fever and tender hepatomegaly. Hepatobiliary imaging showed infiltrative liver disease with small cystic lesions and periportal thickening. Liver biopsy showed microabscesses with eosinophilic infiltration. The patient was tested for Fasciola IgG antibody, which was positive. Triclabendazole was procured from Geneva for treatment. Through this report, we highlight this neglected parasitic infection that presented in a nonendemic region that needs improved diagnostic tools, increased awareness, and control measures to mitigate the disease."

The impact of ETI on health care resource utilization in the context of universal health care is largely unknown. We aimed to assess the impact of ETI on hospital and non-hospital health care resource utilization in a national cohort of pwCF up to 2 years after ETI initiation. We included all pwCF aged 12 years or older in the Danish Cystic Fibrosis Cohort initiating ETI therapy between 1 September 2020 and 31 December 2022. The following health care contacts were reported: acute and elective hospitalizations, acute and elective outpatient contacts, general practitioner (GP) visits, other specialist visits, physiotherapist/chiropractor visits, pharmacy visits, and blood sampling appointments. Pre- and post-ETI data were analyzed using logistic and linear regression models estimating number of visits, days in hospital, and odds ratios (ORs) for one monthly contact. A total of 283 pwCF initiated ETI in the study period. At 24 months post-ETI, utilization of the following health care resources was reduced: elective hospitalizations [OR 0.20 (95% CI: 0.08; 0.50)], elective outpatient hospital contacts [0.70 (0.57; 0.86)], pharmacy visits [0.56 (0.45; 0.71)], and blood sampling appointments [0.61 (0.49; 0.77)]. Number of contacts per month was reduced for the aforementioned outcomes, as well as number of days in hospital for elective hospitalizations. A downward but not statistically significant trend was observed for acute hospitalizations. No significant change was observed for acute outpatient visits, GP visits, other specialist visits, or visits to a physiotherapist/chiropractor. In a national cohort of pwCF, ETI was associated with substantial reductions in elective hospitalizations, elective outpatient contacts, duration of elective hospitalizations, pharmacy visits, and blood sampling appointments, sustained 2 years post-ETI initiation. These findings highlight the real-world effectiveness of ETI in the context of a universal health care system."

Effective anti-microbial immunity and maintaining lung homeostasis require continuous structural-immune cell communication. Whether and how this crosstalk is altered in CF remains poorly understood, obscuring potential new angles for therapy development to restore airway homeostasis in pwCF. We performed droplet-based single cell RNA-sequencing on bronchial biopsies from pwCF to investigate structural-immune cell crosstalk. Computational analyses were used to compare these data to samples obtained from healthy controls. CF airway wall biopsies showed lower proportions and altered transcriptomes of basal cells, submucosal gland cells and endothelial cells, and a higher abundance of ciliated cells, monocytes, macrophages and T cells. Both B and T lymphocytes displayed aberrantly activated phenotypes with transcriptional changes linked to hypoxia and vascular endothelial growth factor signaling, indicative of crosstalk with endothelial cells. The CF lung displayed unique changes in intercellular communication potential involving ionocytes, macrophages, endothelial cells and lymphocytes. This included interactions between HLA-E on structural cells and the druggable CD94/NKG2A immune checkpoint on CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells. We report the first single cell transcriptome atlas of the CF lung containing the full spectrum of structural and immune cells, providing a valuable resource for investigating changes to cellular composition, phenotypes and crosstalk linked to CF. Our analyses highlight dysregulated basal cell function and adaptive immunity in pwCF - despite favorable responses to CFTR modulator therapy. We identify novel aspects of CF pathophysiology and potential entry points for therapeutic strategies."

    "abstract": "During the COVID-19 pandemic, mortality from some chronic diseases increased. In this study, we evaluated monthly excess mortality from all causes, cancer, cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and diabetes during the months of 2020 and 2021, examining its relationship with COVID-19 cases. Monthly cause-specific mortality data were downloaded from public repositories of national statistics offices or directly requested from them, and population data were obtained from the United Nations archives. Excess deaths were estimated as the difference between observed and expected deaths. Monthly expected deaths for 2020 and 2021 were calculated using a quasi-Poisson regression model trained on 2010-19 data (or a shorter timespan if the full decade of data was not available). To quantify the correlation between COVID-19 cases and monthly excess mortality, we used the Spearman's correlation coefficient (rs). The study included 16 countries that provided monthly national data on causes of death (Argentina, Austria, Brazil, Switzerland, Chile, the Czech Republic, Germany, Georgia, Hungary, Italy, Lithuania, Latvia, Mexico, Serbia, Slovakia and the USA). A positive correlation was found between COVID-19 cases and monthly excess mortality from all causes in all countries (rs ranging from 0.61 to 0.91), from CVD in 11 countries (rs ranging from 0.45 to 0.85) and for diabetes in 13 countries (rs ranging from 0.42 to 0.79). Excess mortality above 5% was estimated from all causes in 14 countries for both 2020 and 2021, from CVD in seven countries for 2020 and in nine countries for 2021, and from diabetes in 11 countries for 2020 and in 12 countries for 2021. No excess above 5% was estimated for cancer mortality in any of the countries considered. Excess mortality from CVD and diabetes persisted in several countries throughout 2021. These increases coincide with COVID-19 peaks, supporting a short-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mortality from these causes."

Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a main cause of chronic infections in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) and wounds. Here, by immersing wounded zebrafish embryos in a suspension of P. aeruginosa isolates from CF patients, we established a model of persistent infection that mimics a murine chronic skin infection model. Live and electron microscopy revealed persisting aggregated P. aeruginosa inside zebrafish cells, including macrophages, at unprecedented resolution. Persistent P. aeruginosa exhibited adaptive resistance to several antibiotics, host cell permeable drugs being the most efficient. Moreover, persistent bacteria could be partly re-sensitized to antibiotics upon addition of anti-biofilm molecules that dispersed the bacterial aggregates in vivo. Collectively, this study demonstrates that an intracellular location protects persistent P. aeruginosa in vivo in wounded zebrafish embryos from host innate immunity and antibiotics, and provides new insights into efficient treatments against chronic infections."

To assess this, sequencing analysis of EV-miRNAs prepared from human bone marrow-derived MSCs (hMSCs) exposed ex vivo to bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from ARDS patients or healthy volunteers (HV) identified a number of differentially expressed miRNAs. Discriminant, differential expression, and functional enrichment analyses identified 14 miRNAs significantly changed following ARDS versus HV BALF exposure. Network analysis showed 4 (miR-760, miR-3175, miR-885-3p, and miR-766-3p) of the 14 EV-miRNAs formed a regulatory \"hub\", suggesting co-targeting of specific gene pathways. In silico prediction identified a number of pathways important in lung injury. Two miRNAs involved in regulation of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), miRNA-145-5p and miRNA-138-5p, were also significantly increased in ARDS BALF-exposed hMSCs EVs. Functionally, EVs from hMSCs exposed to either ARDS or HV BALF had differential effects on CFTR Cl<sup>-</sup> secretion by cultured primary human bronchial epithelial cells, an effect predicted to reduce mucociliary clearance.

    "title": "Persistent delay in maturation of the developing gut microbiota in infants with cystic fibrosis.",
    "abstract": "The healthy human infant gut microbiome undergoes stereotypical changes in taxonomic composition between birth and maturation to an adult-like stable state. During this time, extensive communication between microbiota and the host immune system contributes to health status later in life. Although there are many reported associations between microbiota compositional alterations and disease in adults, less is known about how microbiome development is altered in pediatric diseases. One pediatric disease linked to altered gut microbiota composition is cystic fibrosis (CF), a multi-organ genetic disease involving impaired chloride secretion across epithelia and heightened inflammation both in the gut and at other body sites. Here, we use shotgun metagenomics to profile the strain-level composition and developmental dynamics of the infant fecal microbiota from several CF and non-CF longitudinal cohorts spanning from birth to greater than 36 months of life. We identify a set of keystone species that define microbiota development in early life in non-CF infants but are missing or decreased in relative abundance in infants with CF, resulting in a delayed pattern of microbiota maturation, persistent entrenchment in a transitional developmental phase, and subsequent failure to attain an adult-like stable microbiota. Delayed maturation is strongly associated with cumulative antibiotic treatments, and we also detect the increased relative abundance of oral-derived bacteria and higher levels of fungi in infants with CF, features that are associated with decreased gut bacterial density. These findings suggest the potential for future directed therapies targeted at overcoming developmental delays in microbiota maturation for infants with CF.IMPORTANCEThe human gastrointestinal tract harbors a diversity of microbes that colonize upon birth and collectively contribute to host health throughout life. Infants with the disease cystic fibrosis (CF) harbor altered gut microbiota compared to non-CF counterparts, with lower levels of beneficial bacteria. How this altered population is established in infants with CF and how it develops over the first years of life is not well understood. By leveraging multiple large non-CF infant fecal metagenomic data sets and samples from a CF cohort collected prior to highly effective modulator therapy, we define microbiome maturation in infants up to 3 years of age. Our findings identify conserved age-diagnostic species in the non-CF infant microbiome that are diminished in abundance in CF counterparts that instead exhibit an enrichment of oral-derived bacteria and fungi associated with antibiotic exposure. Together, our study builds toward microbiota-targeted therapy to restore healthy microbiota dynamics in infants with CF."

However, the contribution of lysogenic bacteriophages to the incidence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in clinical settings is poorly understood. Here, in a set of 186 clinical isolates of <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> collected from respiratory cultures from 82 patients with cystic fibrosis, we evaluate the links between prophage counts and both genomic and phenotypic resistance to six anti-pseudomonal antibiotics: tobramycin, colistin, ciprofloxacin, meropenem, aztreonam, and piperacillin-tazobactam. We identified 239 different prophages in total. We find that <i>P. aeruginosa</i> isolates contain on average 3.06 ± 1.84 (SD) predicted prophages. We find no significant association between the number of prophages per isolate and the minimum inhibitory concentration for any of these antibiotics. We then investigate the relationship between particular prophages and AMR. We identify a single lysogenic phage associated with phenotypic resistance to the antibiotic tobramycin and, consistent with this association, we observe that AMR genes associated with resistance to tobramycin are more likely to be found when this prophage is present. However, we find that they are not encoded directly on prophage sequences. Additionally, we identify a single prophage statistically associated with ciprofloxacin resistance but do not identify any genes associated with ciprofloxacin phenotypic resistance. These findings suggest that prophages are only infrequently associated with the AMR genes in clinical isolates of <i>P. aeruginosa</i>.IMPORTANCEAntibiotic-resistant infections of <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> (<i>Pa</i>), a leading pathogen in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), are a global health threat. While lysogenic bacteriophages are known to facilitate horizontal gene transfer, their role in promoting antibiotic resistance in clinical settings remains poorly understood. In our analysis of 186 clinical isolates of <i>P. aeruginosa</i> from CF patients, we find that prophage abundance does not predict phenotypic resistance to key antibiotics but that specific prophages are infrequently associated with tobramycin resistance genes. In addition, we do not find antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes encoded directly on prophages. These results highlight that while phages can be associated with AMR, phage-mediated AMR transfer may be rare in clinical isolates and difficult to identify. This work is important for future efforts on mitigating AMR in CFCF and other vulnerable populations affected by <i>Pa</i> infections and advances our understanding of bacterial-phage dynamics in clinical infections."

Especially in patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) disease, DLBCL remains a challenging cancer to treat. Metabolic reprogramming is a hallmark of malignant cells. Our research focuses on developing strategies to enhance clinical outcomes for R/R DLBCL patients by targeting metabolic vulnerabilities. <b>Methods:</b> We investigated the effects of combining metformin and L-asparaginase, two FDA-approved antimetabolic drugs, on DLBCL cell metabolism and survival. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy was employed to assess metabolic disturbances induced by the drug combination. The impact on lipid metabolism, glycolysis, glutaminolysis, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and antioxidant responses was examined. Induction of apoptosis was evaluated by FACS analysis. <b>Results:</b> The combination of metformin and L-asparaginase strongly sensitized DLBCL cells to apoptosis, independently of their oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) or BCR/glycolytic status. NMR spectroscopy revealed that this combination induces broader metabolic disturbances than either drug alone. It disrupts lipid metabolism by altering levels of phospholipids, cholesterol, and fatty acids. Additionally, it counteracts the pro-glycolytic effect of metformin, decreases glycolysis, and reduces glutaminolysis. It also affects the TCA cycle and antioxidant responses, critical for cellular energy production and redox balance. Furthermore, this combination interferes with two key cancer survival pathways, mTORC1 and MAPK signaling. Importantly, proof of principle for its beneficial effect was demonstrated in DLBCL patients. <b>Conclusions:</b> Combining metformin and L-asparaginase affects DLBCL cell survival by targeting multiple metabolic pathways and may represent a novel therapeutic approach for R/R DLBCL patients."

However, the potential connection between GLP-1 RAs and the risk of pancreatitis presents a complex and nuanced issue. Although these drugs are effective in improving blood sugar control and cardiovascular health, their association with pancreatitis remains an area of concern. Our study aims to evaluate the association between the use of GLP-1 RAs, considered as a single class, and the risk of pancreatitis in a comorbidity-free subgroup of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in the United States. <b>Methods:</b> Data were retrieved from the TriNetX research database using the US Collaborative Network, which included information from 61 healthcare organizations within the U.S. Patients diagnosed with T2DM were categorized into two cohorts: one consisting of the patients prescribed with GLP-1 RAs and the other comprising patients who did not receive GLP-1 RAs. Of this class of medications, the agents analyzed were dulaglutide, lixisenatide, exenatide, liraglutide, and semaglutide. Using a 1:1 propensity score matching (PSM) model, we matched patients of both cohorts based on baseline demographics, comorbidities (hypertensive disorders, ischemic heart disease, gallstones, annular pancreas, alcohol use disorders, hypertriglyceridemia, hypercalcemia, cystic fibrosis, and cannabis use), medications known to cause drug-related pancreatitis, and laboratory values. <b>Results:</b> Of 969,240 patients with T2DM, 9.7% (93,608) were on GLP-1 RA, and 90.3% (875,632) were not.

The risk of pancreatitis between the two groups was not statistically different between the two cohorts at 6 months at (0.1% vs. 0.1%, <i>p</i> = 0.04), and remained without significant increase with time; at 1 year (0.1% vs. 0.2%, <i>p</i> = 0.02), 3 years (0.2% vs. 0.3%, <i>p</i> = 0.001), and 5 years (0.3% vs. 0.4%, <i>p</i> < 0.001). The lifetime risk of developing pancreatitis in patients on GLP-1 RA was lower (0.3% vs. 0.4%, <i>p</i> < 0.001). <b>Conclusions:</b> In our comorbidity-free U.S.-based population with T2DM, the use of GLP-1 RAs did not increase their risk of pancreatitis. Their use was associated with a lower lifetime risk of pancreatitis."

We investigated LibAirty, a novel medical device, and compared it with the common practice performed today. <b>Methods</b>: Twenty adults enrolled, and each one had three different treatments in a randomized order: a human respiratory physiotherapist, a High-Frequency Chest Wall Oscillator, and LibAirty with BiPAP. The outcome parameters were mucus weight and a questionnaire. Further studies were performed to investigate LibAirty with hypertonic saline (HS) inhalation and using the device as a standalone. <b>Results</b>: No adverse events were recorded. The sputum amount expectorated in all arms using LibAirty was 14.4 ± 11.1 g with BIPAP, 16.4 ± 7 g with HS, and 11.3 ± 4.1 g for the standalone treatment. For HFCWO, 4.45 ± 3.28 g was obtained, and for CPT, 15.9 ± 11.1 g was obtained. The amount obtained by LibAirty (all arms) was significantly higher than HFCWO. <b>Conclusions</b>: All arms of LibAirty were superior to HFCWO and similar to the human physiotherapist. Further studies should be performed to investigate the long-term effects of LibAirty."

    "abstract": "During the pandemic, the pneumology team at Bambino Gesù Children's Hospital highlighted that telemedicine was a valuable tool for remotely managing the medical needs of children with medical complexity (CMC). Following the telemedicine experience during the emergency phase, a telemedicine service was established, and new tools were tested to optimize televisits and the overall eHealth approach for patients. In this context, the TytoHome™ device was tested for performing objective examinations remotely. This pilot study, conducted at our hospital, explored the management of CMC patients on long-term mechanical ventilation via the telemedicine platform and the TytoHome™ device. This study involved the treatment of 10 pediatric patients over one year using this approach. The patients were already receiving care at our hospital and were undergoing long-term mechanical ventilation (LTV) at home-4 on invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) and 6 on non-invasive ventilation (NIV). A database was developed to collect patient data, including personal details, vital parameters, objective examinations, audio quality, and patient satisfaction. A descriptive analysis was subsequently performed using the data collected during the earlier stages of the study. The utility of the TytoCare device for medically complex children was evaluated. The families were \"satisfied\" with the remote follow-up visits, and healthcare personnel rated the audio quality of the visits as \"good.\" In conclusion, the remote management of these patients using the Tyto device offered several advantages. In our experience, Tyto proved to be a useful tool for the remote medical management of complex patients."

    "abstract": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms contribute to the persistent presence of this bacterium in the cystic fibrosis airways. P. aeruginosa produces histamine in vitro and expresses histamine receptors. We investigated whether histamine regulated P. aeruginosa biofilm formation in vitro and contributed to bacterial virulence in Galleria mellonella. P. aeruginosa biofilms were measured by staining bacteria adhered on polystyrene with crystal violet. Histamine concentrations were measured by ELISA. G. mellonella survival upon inoculation with P. aeruginosa was measured in the absence or presence of histamine. The concentration of histamine in the BHI broth was 140 ng/mL (1.3 μ<sc>m</sc>). Addition to the broth of diamine oxidase (DAO), an enzyme that catabolizes histamine, reduced by ∼3-fold the concentration of histamine and by 2-fold PAO1 strain biofilms. Addition of histamine (10-9<sc>m</sc>-10-4<sc>m</sc>) to the LB medium augmented P. aeruginosa biofilms. Maximum effects were observed with concentrations of 10-5<sc>m</sc> and 10-8<sc>m</sc> for the mucoid NH57388A strain and the PAO1 strain, respectively. DAO reduced mucoid NH57388A biofilms induced by histamine (10-4<sc>m</sc>) added to the LB medium. Addition of histamine to 48 h formed biofilms reduced anti-biofilm activities of gentamicin and azithromycin. Inoculation of G. mellonella with the PAO1 strain led to augmented histamine concentration in the haemolymph. Inoculation of histamine (10-8<sc>m</sc>) reduced the survival rate of G. mellonella infected with the PAO1 strain. Histamine produced during periods of infection may augment P. aeruginosa virulence by promoting the biofilm mode of life of this bacterium."

    "title": "Mucus Physically Restricts Influenza A Viral Particle Access to the Epithelium.",
    "abstract": "Prior work suggests influenza A virus (IAV) crosses the airway mucus barrier in a sialic acid-dependent manner through the actions of the viral envelope proteins, hemagglutinin, and neuraminidase. However, host and viral factors that influence how efficiently mucus traps IAV remain poorly defined. In this work, how the physicochemical properties of mucus influence its ability to effectively capture IAV is assessed using fluorescence video microscopy and multiple particle tracking. Our studies suggest an airway mucus gel layer must be produced with virus-sized pores to physically constrain IAV. While sialic acid binding by IAV may improve mucus trapping efficiency, sialic acid binding preference is found to have little impact on IAV mobility and the fraction of viral particles expected to penetrate the mucus barrier. Further, synthetic polymeric hydrogels engineered with mucus-like architecture are similarly protective against IAV infection despite their lack of sialic acid decoy receptors. Together, this work provides new insights on mucus barrier function toward IAV with important implications on innate host defense and transmission of respiratory viruses."

    "abstract": "Dalbavancin exposures select for VAN and daptomycin cross-resistance in Staphylococcus aureus often by walK-related mutations. Oritavancin is another long-acting lipoglycopeptide, but its proclivity to select for cross-resistance is unknown. The objective of this study was to determine if post-distributional pharmacokinetic oritavancin exposures select for meaningful susceptibility changes in S. aureus. We simulated average post-distributional, free-drug exposures of oritavancin 1200 mg IV once (fCmax 11.2 µg/mL; β-elimination t1/2 13.4 h; γ-elimination t1/2 245 h) in an in vitro pharmacodynamic model for 28 days against five S. aureus including four MRSA. Samples were taken daily for colony enumeration and resistance screening. Susceptibility testing was repeated on isolates from resistance screening plates against oritavancin, vancomycin, daptomycin, dalbavancin and 6 beta-lactams with varying penicillin-binding protein affinities. Tested oritavancin exposures were bactericidal against 5/5 strains for 2-17 days before regrowth of less-susceptible subpopulations occurred. Isolates with reduced susceptibility to oritavancin were detected as early as 5 days, but the MIC increased above the susceptibility breakpoint (>0.125 mg/L) in 4/5 strains eventually. Vancomycin and daptomycin MICs increased by 2- to 8-fold but did not exceed the susceptibility breakpoints in most isolates. β-lactam MICs were largely unchanged among the recovered isolates with reduced oritavancin susceptibility. Mutations were diverse but often involved purR with 13 unique variants identified among 4/5 strains. Oritavancin-selected resistance was primarily associated with purR mutation and less frequently associated with cross-resistance and walK mutation than dalbavancin-selected resistance in similar strains and conditions. The reason for this is unclear but may stem from differences in the mechanism(s) and divergent mutational pathways."

How elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor (ETI) fails to improve innate immune signaling responsible for bacterial clearance and inflammation resolution remains unknown. We used an unbiased proteomics approach to measure the effect of ETI on inflammatory proteins. Plasma from 20 pediatric pwCF and 20 non-CF (NCF) was collected during routine examination and 3 months after ETI initiation. Protein screening was performed with an inflammation panel (Target 96, Olink<sup>®</sup>). Bioinformatics analysis was used to determine changes in protein expression. There were significantly fewer pulmonary exacerbations after ETI initiation, along with sustained improvement in lung function and reduced bacterial colonization. Unpaired analysis of CF pre-ETI and NCF resulted in 34 significantly different proteins. Of these, CCL20, MMP-10, EN-RAGE, and AXIN1 had a log<sub>2</sub> fold change of 1.2 or more. There was a modest shift in overall CF protein profiles post-ETI toward the NCF cluster. Unpaired analysis of protein differential expression between NCF and CF post-ETI identified a total of 24 proteins significantly impacted by ETI therapy (<i>p</i>-value ≤ 0.05), with only CCL20 having a log<sub>2</sub> fold change higher than 1.2. Paired analysis (CF pre- and CF post-ETI) of differential protein expression demonstrated significant expression changes of MMP-10, EN-RAGE, and IL-17A. Pathway analysis identified significantly impacted pathways such as the NF-κB pathway. This study showed that ETI in a pediatric cohort had a modest effect on several inflammatory proteins with potential as biomarkers. Pathways significantly impacted by ETI can be further studied for future therapies to combat persistent inflammation and dysregulated immunity."

    "abstract": "People with CF (pwCF) are often treated with prolonged courses of aminoglycosides (AGs), for which known adverse effects include ototoxicity as a subset of hearing impairment (HI). The PIANO-CF trial was a single-center study conducted at The Royal Children's Hospital where 28 pediatric patients aged < 7 years underwent sequential hearing tests at increased range up to 12,500 Hz in relation to receiving intravenous (IV) AGs. More than 85% of the cohort (n = 24) participated in the follow-up hearing testing up to 1 year. HI was defined by degree (dB) and frequency (Hz) on the audiogram. This was further reviewed to determine if the type of HI was consistent with ototoxicity as there are frequently other causes of HI in this age group. At baseline the prevalence of HI and ototoxicity were 11% and 7%, respectively. Over a period of 1 year, HI was identified in 12.5% and that of ototoxicity in 6%. No correlation was found between degree of IV AG exposure and HI or ototoxicity. The finding of HI in young children with CF, including in those with minimal IV AG exposure, has implications for CF services to proactively screen for HI. Undetected HI may compromise learning outcomes and given the age of children studied, this is not insignificant during the acquisition and development of language skills. Routine audiometric testing for pwCF up to 12,500 Hz or beyond may increase sensitivity in detection of ototoxicity and should be considered for use in screening, monitoring, and future research."

Furthermore, the transcript expression of type I and type III interferon (IFN) genes was examined in the cells of respiratory samples from these patients and compared with a <i>Pandoraea</i>-negative group of CF individuals. Increased respiratory levels of IFNβ, IFNε and IL28R1 mRNA were found in the three siblings.

    "abstract": "This study aimed to provide the first evidence of the socioeconomic burden of cystic fibrosis (CF) in Czechia. In a cross-sectional questionnaire-based primary data collection conducted from 2020 to 2021 among Czech patients with CF, we collected demographic, clinical, and healthcare resource use data, out-of-pocket and social transfer costs, and questionnaires: Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised, Work Productivity and Activity Impairment, EQ-5D, and Zarit Burden Interview. Productivity loss/costs were assessed using the human capital approach with patient patient-assumed life expectancy of 45 years and caregiver retirement age of 64 years and discounted by 3%. A total of 257 patients completed the questionnaires (37% of the Czech CF population). The average age was 17 years; most were females (59%), and the average forced expiratory volume in 1 second was 81.4% (SD 25.4%). A total of 107 patients had caregivers with an average age of 39 years and a significant caregiver time burden (extra 4.6 hours/day). The average Zarit Burden Interview score (25.4) was comparable with advanced cancer, dementia, or Duchenne muscular dystrophy. The proportion of unemployed caregivers was 10× higher than the general population (31% vs 3.2%). Total out-of-pocket family costs related to CF were €278/month, mainly for medicines (€105), foods (€73), and transport (€59); 25% received a disability pension and 18% other social security benefits. The work impairment of employed patients and caregivers was 25% and 15%, respectively, mostly due to presenteeism. Total lifetime productivity costs extrapolated to all Czech patients with CF (n = 687) and their caregivers were €155 181 286 (€225 883/person). The societal burden imposed on Czech patients with CF and their caregivers is significant. Caregivers seem to be affected by higher disease activity more than patients."

    "abstract": "Ciprofloxacin (CIP) is effective against many Gram-negative pathogens and penetrates well into respiratory secretions and pulmonary tissues, thus making it useful for treating respiratory infections in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). A 13-year-old patient with severe CF and an acute respiratory exacerbation from multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa was treated with 700 mg of CIP every 8 hours. Bronchial secretions confirmed that P. aeruginosa was sensitive to high doses of CIP. Pharmacokinetic monitoring using 2 blood samples estimated the AUC24 at 50 hours*mg/L. This led to an increase in CIP dosage to 850 mg three time a day (TID), then to 1000 mg TID, and finally to 1200 mg every 6 hours. CIP pharmacokinetics can vary significantly, particularly in patients with CF due to increased clearance, ultimately resulting in shorter half-lives and higher risks of therapeutic failure and resistance. Therapeutic drug monitoring helps when adjusting dosages to maintain effective blood concentrations. This case underscores the role of therapeutic drug monitoring in optimizing CIP dosing for patients with CF and highlights the necessity for close collaboration between clinicians and pharmacologists to ensure effective antibiotic exposure."

    "abstract": "Rare diseases affect a small percentage of an individual country's population; however, with over 7,000 in total, rare diseases represent a significant disease burden impacting up to 10% of the world's population. Despite this, there are no approved treatments for almost 95% of rare diseases, and the existing treatments are cost-intensive for the patients. More than 70% of rare diseases are genetic in nature, with patient-specific mutations. This calls for the need to have personalised and patient-specific preclinical models that can lead to effective, speedy, and affordable therapeutic options. Complex <i>in vitro</i> models (CIVMs), including those using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), organoids, and organs-on-chips are emerging as powerful human-based pre-clinical systems with the capacity to provide efficacy data enabling drugs to move into clinical trials. In this narrative review, we discuss how CIVMs are providing insights into biomedical research on rare diseases. We also discuss how these systems are being used in clinical trials to develop efficacy models for rare diseases. Finally, we propose recommendations on how human relevant CIVMs could be leveraged to increase translatability of basic, applied and nonclinical research outcomes in the field of rare disease therapeutics in developed as well as middle-and low-income countries."

To evaluate the impact of ETI on systemic inflammation in children and adolescents with CF. Retrospective, dual-center observational, propensity score-matching study of pediatric pwCF on ETI. PwCF aged ⩽ 18 years treated with ETI at two Italian reference centers were included in this study. Data on immunoglobulins (Ig) (A, G, and M), γ-globulin, leukocyte levels, percent predicted forced expiratory volume in the first second (ppFEV1), sweat chloride (SC) concentration, and sputum cultures were collected at baseline, 12, and 24 months of treatment. Laboratory data of a control group (pwCF, not in ETI therapy, same demographic characteristics as the study group) were also collected. Sixty-six patients (30 males, median age: 12 years, F508del homozygous: 23) were included. Mean IgG levels (SD) significantly decreased (<i>p</i> = 0.001) from 1168.20 mg/dl (344.41) at baseline to 1093.05 mg/dl (258.73; 12 months) and 1092.87 mg/dl (232.42; 24 months).

Aim of study was to evaluate the prognostic significance of the MELD-XI score and compare it with the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation 2 (APACHE 2) scores in patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for respiratory failure. Out of 822 patients with respiratory failure between September 2020 and June 2023, a total of 727 patients with etiologies of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation, cardiogenic pulmonary edema, pulmonary thromboembolism, pneumonia, bronchiectasis, kyphoscoliosis, neuromuscular diseases, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, and diffuse parenchymal lung disease were included. A statistically significant correlation was found between MELD-XI, SOFA, and APACHE 2 scores. The cutoff value of the MELD-XI score was 11 on receiver operating characteristic analysis, indicating a higher risk of mortality in patients with a score of 11 or above. The APACHE 2 and SOFA scores of the MELD-XI ≥11 group were found to be higher and the Glasgow Coma Scale were lower than the MELD-XI <11 group. MELD-XI ≥11 was associated with an increased risk of mortality in overall [Hazard ratio (HR): 4.1, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2-6.4, <i>P</i> < 0.001] and subgroups with different etiologies in Cox regression analysis. In the multivariate analysis, MELD-XI was the most important independent variable indicating an increased risk of mortality, regardless of etiology (HR: 2.4, 95% CI: 2.0-2.5, <i>P</i> < 0.001). MELD-XI is an important marker of ICU mortality in patients with respiratory failure due to different etiologies and is as effective as the SOFA and APACHE 2 in predicting mortality."

    "abstract": "Nanoparticles-based gene delivery has emerged as a promising approach for the treatment of genetic diseases based on efficient delivery systems for therapeutic nucleic acids (NAs) into the target cells. For pulmonary diseases such as cystic fibrosis (CF), chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD), infectious disease or lung cancer, aerosol delivery is the best choice to locally deliver NAs into the lungs. It is, therefore, important to investigate the effects of nebulization conditions on the efficiency of delivery. To this purpose, the non-viral vector branched polyethyleneimine (b-PEI, 25 kDa) was investigated for plasmid delivery by aerosol. Two types of nebulizers, jet nebulizer and mesh nebulizer, were compared regarding the properties of the nanoparticles (NPs) formed, the efficiency of NAs delivery <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> models and the pulmonary deposition. The results indicate that the mesh nebulizer has a better gene delivery performance than the jet nebulizer in this application. This superiority was demonstrated in terms of size, concentration, distribution of NPs and efficiency of NAs delivery. However, pulmonary deposition appears to be similar regardless of the nebulizer used, and the difference between the two systems lies in the inhalable dose. These results underline the crucial role of nebulization techniques in optimizing aerosol-mediated gene delivery by b-PEI and highlight the potential of mesh nebulizers as promising tools to improved gene therapy. Therefore, the comparison must be performed for each gene therapy formulation to determine the most suitable nebulizer."

Lung function variability is a leading predictor of decline, but the association between ivacaftor initiation and FEV<sub>1</sub>pp variability has not been characterized. We utilized the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Patient Registry (2008-2020) to quantify this association and identify risk factors of increased variability. Linear mixed effects models were used to compare pre- and post-ivacaftor initiation periods for established outcome measures of FEV<sub>1</sub>pp variability: i) maximum and ii) median deviations from the best (highest) FEV<sub>1</sub>pp during each period; iii) maximum, iv) median, and v) standard deviation about the trendline of the FEV<sub>1</sub>pp trajectory in each period. The analysis cohort included 527 individuals. Across outcomes, FEV<sub>1</sub>pp variability was reduced after ivacaftor initiation (median reduction: 1.85 % predicted). Reductions were robust with highest magnitudes of effect identified using maximum deviation from the best FEV<sub>1</sub>pp while most consistent findings were reached with trendline measures, particularly median deviation. Risk factors for increased FEV<sub>1</sub>pp variability differed between children and adults but were consistent between G551D and R117H subgroups. F508del homozygous patients followed contemporaneously exhibited minimal change in variability (median change: 0.25 % predicted). Reduced variability weakly correlated with changes in FEV<sub>1</sub>pp and slope, but higher levels of pre-ivacaftor variability were associated with greater reductions. There was evidence that ivacaftor initiation reduces FEV<sub>1</sub>pp variability in people with CF. Quantifying FEV<sub>1</sub>pp variability may have utility as a marker of therapeutic effectiveness."

    "abstract": "Early-life inflammation has long been recognised as a key pathophysiological process in the evolution of cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease. Despite this, no CF-specific anti-inflammatory treatments have been developed. This is crucial even in the era of highly effective modulator therapy as recent evidence suggests that modulators alter, but may not fully resolve, pulmonary inflammation. In this study, we used clinical microbiology data, high-dimensional flow cytometry and multiplex immunoassays to compare pulmonary (bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)) and systemic immunity in 70 preschool children with CF and a total of 32 age-matched preschool controls. We show that inflammation in the early-life CF lung is characterised by innate cell infiltration (neutrophils: 31.31 vs 1.8% of BAL in CF compared with controls, FDRp=0.0001; eosinophils: 0.55 vs 0.06%, FDRp=0.001, and monocytes: 1.91 vs 0.45%, FDRp=0.004) and widespread upregulation of both traditional and type 2 inflammatory soluble signatures (40 analytes significantly elevated in BAL of CF compared with controls, all FDRp<0.1). Key targetable features of this response included pulmonary interleukin (IL)-8 and IL-13 which were most significantly associated with neutrophilic and eosinophilic infiltration, respectively (IL-8 and neutrophils; Spearman rho=0.68, FDRp=0.002: IL-13 and eosinophils; Spearman rho=0.75, FDRp=0.01). Signatures of type 2 inflammation, as identified by REACTOME pathway analysis, including IL-4, IL-13 and FGF-2, were highly elevated in both the lungs and circulation in early CF. When exploring the efficacy of Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator modulators to resolve pulmonary and systemic inflammation in early life, we showed that different classes of modulators have varying effects on inflammation, with ivacaftor showing a more significant effect in the lungs and circulation than lumacaftor/ivacaftor. Finally, we showed that CF children with pathogen colonisation had similar levels of pulmonary inflammation as CF children without pathogen colonisation (no significant differences), and that inflammation was evident during infancy even without evidence of colonisation (as observed by significant increases in levels of SDF-1alpha, M-CSF, IL-2, IL-9, IL-12p40, IL-17, MCP-1 and LIGHT/TNFSF14, all FDRp<0.1), highlighting a role for intrinsic dysregulation of inflammation that begins in early life. We provide a rationale for targeted anti-inflammatory intervention in early-life CF."

    "abstract": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) treatment has revolutionised care over the past three decades with major advances in survival. Despite these advances, CF continues to create psychological and social challenges for people with CF (PWCF) throughout their life and is associated with worse health outcomes and higher healthcare costs. Anxiety and depression screening and management protocols are widely implemented within CF care; however, a much broader scope of psychosocial challenges exist which lack a standardised screening and management approach. The advent of CF transmembrane conductance regulator modulator therapies is transforming the psychosocial landscape for PWCF with new challenges and evolving psychosocial needs. What it means to have CF, the expectations, hopes and stressors are rapidly changing, and psychosocial care must keep pace if health outcomes are to be fully optimised. A symposium of international CF and psychosocial experts was convened in November 2022 to explore current and emerging issues in psychosocial health and identify opportunities and approaches to optimise psychosocial care. This state-of-the-art review summarises key symposium proceedings and highlights priorities for clinical practice and research in psychosocial health across the lifespan among PWCF. It also summarises state-of-the-art initiatives for screening and intervention to optimise CF psychosocial healthcare and patient outcomes."

Telerehabilitation, which provides remote rehabilitation services <i>via</i> digital platforms, gained importance during the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite its growing use, there is little clarity on the available tools and devices for CF telerehabilitation. This scoping review aims to map the existing tools and devices used in telerehabilitation for pediatric and adult CF patients. The review was conducted following the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology, using the PRISMA-ScR checklist. Comprehensive searches were performed across seven databases, alongside grey literature. Studies involving CF patients and telerehabilitation interventions were included. Data were extracted and analyzed both numerically and thematically. Eighteen studies were included, involving 622 CF patients. The review identified 10 platforms, seven telemonitoring devices, and three rehabilitation devices. Most studies focused on motor rehabilitation with individual, synchronous sessions. Commonly used platforms included Zoom, Skype, and Google Meet, while only three studies used platforms specifically designed for CF. Telerehabilitation for CF is in its early stages and less developed than for other conditions. There is a need for dedicated platforms and devices that address CF patients' specific motor and respiratory needs. Future efforts should focus on developing these tools to improve patient engagement and outcomes."

Despite significant advances, the complex molecular mechanisms underlying CF-related airway pathology are not fully understood. Building upon previous single-cell transcriptomics studies in CF patients and healthy controls, this study employs enhanced analytical methodologies to deepen our understanding of CF-associated gene expression. We employed advanced single-cell transcriptomics techniques, integrating data from multiple sources and implementing rigorous normalization and mapping strategies using a comprehensive lung reference panel. These sophisticated methods were designed to enhance the accuracy and depth of our analysis, with a focus on elucidating differential gene expression and characterizing co-expression network dynamics associated with cystic fibrosis (CF). Our analysis uncovered novel genes and regulatory networks that had not been previously associated with CF airway disease. These findings highlight new potential therapeutic targets that could be exploited to develop more effective interventions for managing CF-related lung conditions. This study provides critical insights into the molecular landscape of CF airway disease, offering new avenues for targeted therapeutic strategies. By identifying key genes and networks involved in CF pathogenesis, our research contributes to the broader efforts to improve the prognosis and quality of life for patients with CF.

Single-center retrospective cohort study of CF LTx candidates (July 2009-June 2019) with available pre-transplant exercise data, who participated in PR 2 to 3 times/week until transplantation. Demographics, CF-related characteristics, aerobic and muscle training volumes, and six-minute walk distance (6MWD) were characterized using descriptive statistics, paired t-tests and Spearman correlations to describe relationships between CF-related characteristics and training volumes. In 86 CF LTx candidates (32 ± 10 years, 49 % males, FEV1: 23 ± 5 %; listing 6MWD 421 ± 89 m), the median PR time was 87 days (24-36 sessions). 78 % had at least one exacerbation and 55 % required hospitalization. 88 % used supplemental oxygen and 37 % required home non-invasive ventilation.

    "abstract": "Pulmonary infections with multidrug-resistant nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM), particularly Mycobacterium abscessus (MAB), are increasingly more prevalent in individuals with lung disease such as cystic fibrosis and are extremely difficult to treat. Protracted antibiotic therapies consist of multidrug regimens that last for months to years. Despite these intense protocols, failure rates are high with 50%-60% of patients not achieving a sustained culture-negative status. A major contributor to the difficult medical management of NTM infections is formation of pulmonary aggregate MAB biofilms which protect the resident bacteria from antimicrobials and host immune effectors. Thereby, novel and more effective approaches to combat recalcitrant NTM infections are urgently needed. We developed an epitope-targeted monoclonal antibody-based technology to rapidly disrupt biofilms and release resident bacteria into a transient yet highly vulnerable phenotype that is significantly more sensitive to killing by both antibiotics and host innate immune effectors (e.g., PMNs and antimicrobial peptides). Herein, we tested this technology in a pre-clinical murine lung infection model to determine whether this treatment would mediate clearance of MAB from the lungs and speed return to homeostasis. As early as 48 h after a single treatment, bacterial loads were reduced to below the level of detection and histopathologic analysis showed markedly decreased inflammation and rapid eradication of aggregate biofilms compared to controls. These new data add to those from multiple prior published studies which show the significant efficacy of this novel therapeutic approach to resolve recalcitrant bacterial biofilm diseases, now potentially including those induced by NTM."

    "abstract": "Elucidating the molecular and cellular effects caused by CFTR variants is crucial to understand Cystic Fibrosis (CF) disease pathophysiology, but also to predict disease severity, to provide genetic counselling, and to determine the most adequate therapeutic strategy for people with CF (pwCF). While the current CFTR modulator drugs (CFTRm) are approved mainly for pwCF with the most prevalent variant, p.Phe508del, pwCF carrying rare and/or uncharacterized CFTR variants are not eligible. However, previous studies have shown that such rare variants can be rescued by the approved CFTRm, suggesting clinical benefit for those pwCF. Here, we characterized the rare and non-eligible p.Ile148Asn CFTR variant found in Portuguese pwCF, regarding CFTR processing, traffic and function, and response to existing CFTRm. We used the forskolin-induced swelling (FIS) assay in intestinal organoids (IOs) from 2 CF individuals carrying p.Ile148Asn in heterozygosity with p.Phe508del and p.Gly542Ter, respectively. Additionally, a Cystic Fibrosis Bronchial Epithelial (CFBE) cell line expressing p.Ile148Asn-CFTR was generated to study the molecular defect of this variant individually. Our results show that p.Ile148Asn is a CF-causing variant, impairing both CFTR plasma membrane (PM) traffic and function, albeit partially. Moreover, p.Ile148Asn-CFTR can be rescued by approved CFTRm in CFBE cells and IOs, suggesting potential clinical benefit for these individuals. The work emphasizes the importance of testing CFTRm for rare variants not included in the drug label. It also shows that the 'theranostic' approach using IOs from pwCF, which captures the genetic background of each individual, complements theratyping in cell lines that focuses only on CFTR variants."

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this unconventional protein secretion (UPS) remain largely elusive. Here, we report that an ER tubulovesicular structure (ER tubular body [ER-TB]), shaped by the tubular ER-phagy receptors ATL3 and RTN3L, plays an important role in stress-induced UPS of transmembrane proteins such as cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein. Correlative light-electron microscopy analyses demonstrate the formation of ER-TB under UPS-inducing conditions in HEK293 and HeLa cells. Individual gene knockdowns of ATL3 and RTN3 inhibit ER-TB formation and the UPS of trafficking-deficient ΔF508-CFTR. Combined supplementation of ATL3 and RTN3L induces ER-TB formation and UPS. ATL3 also participates in the SARS-CoV-2-associated convoluted membrane formation and Golgi-independent trafficking of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. These findings suggest that ER-TB serves a common function in mediating stress-induced UPS, which participates in various physiological and pathophysiological processes."

Substantial evidence demonstrates its critical involvement in the progression of chronic infections. Treating chronic infections seems critical, and there is a worldwide quest for drugs that target pathogens' unique and complex virulence-associated signaling networks. c-di-GMP is a promising therapeutic target by serving as a distinct virulence factor, solving problems associated with drug resistance, biofilm dispersion, and its related septicemia complications. c-di-GMP levels act as checkpoints for several biofilm-associated molecular pathways, viz., Gac/Rsm, BrlR, and SagS signaling systems. C-di-GMP is also engaged in the Wsp chemosensory pathway responsible for rugose small colony variants observed in cystic fibrosis-related lung infections. Considering all factors, c-di-GMP serves as a pivotal hub in the intricate cascade of biofilm regulation. By overseeing QS systems, exopolysaccharide synthesis, and antibiotic resistance pathways in chronic infections, it emerges as a linchpin for effective drug development strategies against biofilm-related ailments. This underscores the significance of understanding the multifaceted signaling networks. c-di-GMP's role is highlighted in this review as a concealed virulence component in various bacterial pathogens, suggesting that medications targeting it could hold promise in treating chronic disorders associated with biofilms."

These data, coupled with data indicating that obesity is associated with accelerated cyst growth in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), led us to hypothesize that maternal obesity may influence the rate of disease progression in offspring. To test this hypothesis, we induced maternal obesity by high-fat diet (HFD) feeding in the orthologous <i>Pkd1</i><sup>RC/RC</sup> mouse model of ADPKD and followed polycystic kidney disease (PKD) progression in offspring for up to 1 year. Surprisingly, and in contrast to our initial hypothesis, exposure to maternal obesity during pregnancy and lactation did not significantly impact PKD severity in offspring at 3 mo or 1 yr of age. In contrast, reexposure to HFD for ∼3 m beginning at 12 wk of age worsened PKD severity in female, but not male, offspring born to obese dams as measured by cystic index, cyst number, and cyst area. Despite worsened cystic parameters, fibrosis and blood urea nitrogen were not altered in these animals. Collectively, these findings indicate that maternal obesity may accelerate PKD severity in female offspring exposed to an obesogenic diet.<b>NEW & NOTEWORTHY</b> Due to the growing obesity pandemic, almost one third of all children are born to mothers with obesity; however, the impact of maternal obesity on polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is unknown.

Isolates of <i>P. aeruginosa</i> from CF patients commonly carry filamentous phages (Pf phages), which constitute a family of temperate phages known to be related to biofilm production and antibiotic sequestration. In this study, we identified 12 new Pf phage genomes in a collection of clinical isolates of <i>P. aeruginosa</i> from CF patients. Study of the anti-phage defense systems in the bacterial isolates revealed the presence of 89 such systems, of which eight were encoded in the Pf phage genomes. Finally, although a weak relation between resistance to phage infection and the number of anti-phage defense systems was detected, it was observed that the phage resistance was related to the presence of Pf phages and the anti-phage defense systems encoded in these phages.IMPORTANCEBacteria harbor a wide range of defense mechanisms to avoid phage infections that hamper the application of phage therapy because they can lead to the rapid acquisition of phage resistance. In this study, eight anti-phage defense systems were found in the genome of 12 Pf phages that were presents in 56% of the CF isolates of <i>P. aeruginosa</i>. The high prevalence of these phages underlines the importance of our findings about newly discovered filamentous phages and the role of these phages in resistance to phage infections. Thus, the knowledge of the anti-defense system in the Pf phage genomes could be useful in assessing the possible application of phage therapy to treat an infectious disease."

    "abstract": "Aspergillus fumigatus (Af) is a major mould pathogen found ubiquitously in the air. It commonly infects the airways of people with cystic fibrosis (CF) leading to Aspergillus bronchitis or allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. Resident alveolar macrophages and recruited neutrophils are important first lines of defence for clearance of Af in the lung. However, their contribution to the inflammatory phenotype in CF during Af infection is not well understood. Here, utilising CFTR deficient mice we describe a hyperinflammatory phenotype in both acute and allergic murine models of pulmonary aspergillosis. We show that during aspergillosis, CFTR deficiency leads to increased alveolar macrophage death and persistent inflammation of the airways in CF, accompanied by impaired fungal control. Utilising CFTR deficient murine cells and primary human CF cells we show that at a cellular level there is increased activation of NFκB and NFAT in response to Af which, as in in vivo models, is associated with increased cell death and reduced fungal control. Taken together, these studies indicate that CFTR deficiency promotes increased activation of inflammatory pathways, the induction of macrophage cell death and reduced fungal control contributing to the hyper-inflammatory of pulmonary aspergillosis phenotypes in CF."

In addition, manual searches of bibliographies from the studies included in the analysis and grey literature were performed. Quality assessment of the included studies was performed according to the guidelines of COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments (COSMIN). The systematic search identified 3,359 studies, of which 26 met the inclusion criteria for the analysis. Two publications were additionally included as a result of the manual search. A total of 16 tools for measuring the quality of life in adults with cystic fibrosis were identified, the measurement properties of which were presented in the included studies. Among these tools, the Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R) and the Cystic Fibrosis Quality of Life Questionnaire (CFQoL) were most frequently analyzed. There were also other new, promising tools. Most studies reported acceptable measurement properties of tools used to measure quality of life in adult patients with cystic fibrosis. In many cases, however, significant limitations were observed related to the lack of comprehensive analysis of the factor structure and other aspects related to validation and responsiveness. There have also been problems with the reliability of some tool scales (including the CFQ-R 14+). The small number of studies makes it difficult to present clear conclusions regarding the usefulness of existing tools. In turn, new tools that may be used in economic analyses (CFQ-R-8 dimensions) or in individualized assessment of quality of life using a mobile application (Q-Life) seem promising. However, further research on large patient populations is necessary to analyze the measurement properties of all tools."

    "abstract": "Cystic Fibrosis (CF) significantly affects the respiratory system, often requiring lung transplantation in advanced stages. This life-saving procedure presents substantial challenges and uncertainties. While there is existing research on support and information needs post-lung transplant from various perspectives, this study aims to specifically address the unique experiences and challenges faced by individuals with CF during both the pre-transplant and post-transplant periods. Twenty-three lung-transplanted individuals with CF participated in this exploratory qualitative study. Data was collected through individual semi-structured interviews and analyzed using inductive content analysis. Participants faced physical and mental challenges, including fatigue, depression, and anxiety. The waiting period involved isolation, dependence on family, and guilt. Post-transplant, they dealt with relief but also severe pain and adjusted to a new identity. Participants highlighted the importance of taking immunosuppressive medications as prescribed, even though the regimen was complicated and these medications had side effects. Participants stressed the need for earlier and more open dialogue with healthcare professionals and better emotional preparation for the transplant process, including preparedness for pain and previously inadequately addressed concerns such as depression and anxiety. This study underscores the significant physical and emotional challenges individuals with CF face during lung transplantation, highlighting the need for comprehensive, person-centered care. Psychological support, effective post-transplant pain management, and early palliative care may be beneficial approaches to improve the patient experience. Nurses can play a pivotal role in this process by ensuring clear communication, managing pain, educating patients on immunosuppressive regimens, and advocating for holistic care."
