    "title": "Decoding Huntington's disease: a global survey on symptoms and genetic testing practices.",
    "abstract": "Huntington's disease (HD) is a fatal, autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the HTT gene. While chorea is the hallmark motor symptom, HD presents with diverse psychiatric and cognitive manifestations that usually precede motor onset. A 10-question online survey was distributed to 130 neurologists and neuro-geneticists from the European Huntington's Disease Network (EHDN) to identify clinical symptoms considered pathognonomic of HD and criteria for genetic testing. Responses from 52 specialists were anonymized and analysed using Microsoft Excel and SPSS 26. Respondents, averaging 18.4 years of experience, universally identified chorea as indicative of HD, alongside cognitive slowing, irritability, and gait abnormalities. Symptoms like neuropathy, limb weakness, and tremor were deemed inconsistent with HD. Notably, 19% of experts reported that ancillary symptoms would not deter them from recommending testing if a primary HD symptom was present. Without a family history, only chorea with or without additional symptoms was deemed sufficient for testing. The findings highlight the complexity of diagnosing HD, the importance of considering subtle psychiatric and cognitive symptoms, and the need for comprehensive patient counselling. Advances in genetic testing and therapeutic trials targeting the molecular root of HD offer hope for curative treatments. This study underscores the growing recognition of HD's pleiotropy, the ethical considerations in testing, and the importance of clinical vigilance as patients may often first present in a non-neurological setting."

    "abstract": "<b>Background</b>: Huntington's disease (HD) is a progressive, autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expanded CAG repeat in the <i>HTT</i> gene. Despite advances in understanding its molecular basis, epidemiological data in many countries, including Bulgaria, remain limited. This study aims to present clinical and genetic findings from a 20-year single-centre cohort. <b>Methods</b>: A retrospective review was conducted of patients evaluated for HD at the University Hospital \"St. Marina\" in Varna between 2004 and 2024. Data included demographics, CAG repeat length, clinical features, imaging, and psychiatric assessments. Statistical analysis focused on correlations between variables, with significance set at <i>p</i> < 0.05. <b>Results</b>: Out of 79 referred individuals, 43 were molecularly confirmed. The mean age of onset was 43 years, with a four-year diagnostic delay. The average CAG repeat length was 44.6, though two symptomatic patients had reduced penetrance alleles (38 and 39 repeats). Cognitive and psychiatric symptoms were each present in 72% of cases. Depression was significantly more prevalent in women (<i>p</i> = 0.011). Most patients had a positive family history, predominantly maternal. <b>Conclusions</b>: Our findings highlight diagnostic delays, gender-specific psychiatric vulnerabilities, and the importance of personalized care. Improved access to genetic counselling and early diagnosis are essential for optimizing outcomes."

    "title": "Modulating Cognition-Linked Histone Acetyltransferases (HATs) as a Therapeutic Strategy for Neurodegenerative Diseases: Recent Advances and Future Trends.",
    "abstract": "Recent investigations into the neuroepigenome of the brain are providing unparalleled understanding into the impact of post-translational modifications (PTMs) of histones in regulating dynamic gene expression patterns required for adult brain cognitive function and plasticity. Histone acetylation is one of the most well-characterized PTMs shown to be required for neuronal function and cognition. Histone acetylation initiates neural circuitry plasticity via chromatin control, enabling neurons to respond to external environmental stimuli and adapt their transcriptional responses accordingly. While interplay between histone acetylation and deacetylation is critical for these functions, dysregulation during the aging process can lead to significant alterations in the neuroepigenetic landscape. These alterations contribute to impaired cognitive functions, neuronal cell death, and brain atrophy, all hallmarks of age-related neurodegenerative disease. Significantly, while age-related generation of DNA mutations remains irreversible, most neuroepigenetic PTMs are reversible. Thus, manipulation of the neural epigenome is proving to be an effective therapeutic strategy for neuroprotection in multiple types of age-related neurodegenerative disorders (NDs) that include Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Huntington's disease (HD). Here, we highlight recent progress in research focusing on specific HAT-based neuroepigenetic mechanisms that underlie cognition and pathogenesis that is hallmarked in age-related NDs. We further discuss how these findings have potential to be translated into HAT-mediated cognitive-enhancing therapeutics to treat these debilitating disorders."

    "abstract": "Variable and imprecise use of the term \"Parkinsonism\" has produced confusion among patients, clinicians, caregivers, and researchers. The term \"atypical Parkinsonism\" can be dispiriting and even demeaning to patients. We therefore propose a slight terminological revision for Parkinsonian disorders to eliminate the terms \"typical\" and \"atypical\" and to confine the term \"Parkinsonism\" to the phenotypic syndrome and not to disease entities. We also suggest replacing the \"atypical Parkinsonism\" term with \"Parkinson's disease-like disorders\" to emphasize that it is not PD but does resemble it at some level. \"Parkinson-like disorders\" would comprise the primary neurodegenerative Parkinsonian disorders other than PD, chiefly MSA, DLB, PSP, and CBD, and would be consistent with the existing neurologic terms, \"Huntington's disease-like,\" \"polio-like,\" and \"stroke-like.\" We would continue the practice of referring to the non-degenerative Parkinsonian disorders as \"secondary Parkinsonian disorders.\""

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases involve toxic protein aggregation. Recent evidence suggests that biomolecular phase separation, a process in which proteins and nucleic acids form dynamic, liquid-like condensates, plays a key role in this aggregation. Optogenetics, originally developed to control neuronal activity with light, has emerged as a powerful tool to investigate phase separation in living systems. This is achieved by fusing disease-associated proteins to light-sensitive oligomerization domains, enabling researchers to induce or reverse condensate formation with precise spatial and temporal control. This review highlights how optogenetic systems such as OptoDroplet are being used to dissect the mechanisms of neurodegenerative disease. We examine how these tools have been applied in models of neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's disease. These studies implicate small oligomeric aggregates as key drivers of toxicity and highlight new opportunities for therapeutic screening. Finally, we discuss advances in light-controlled dissolution of condensates and future directions for applying optogenetics to combat neurodegeneration. By enabling precise, dynamic control of protein phase behavior in living systems, optogenetic approaches provide a powerful framework for elucidating disease mechanisms and informing the development of targeted therapies."

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative conditions, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease, result in a substantial health problem for the elderly, marked by ongoing neuronal degeneration and a deterioration in mental faculties. These disorders are frequently linked to oxidative stress, problems with mitochondria, and persistent inflammation in the brain, which worsen neuronal damage. The neurohormone melatonin, primarily secreted by the pineal gland, has gained recognition as a promising therapeutic agent due to its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective effects. Melatonin's functions extend beyond its regulation of circadian rhythms, as research has demonstrated its ability to remove free radicals, improve mitochondrial performance, and adjust immune system responses, ultimately reducing the progression of neurodegenerative disease. Research findings from preclinical and clinical trials imply that taking melatonin supplements could lead to improved cognitive abilities, slower disease progression, and an overall better quality of life for elderly individuals suffering from neurodegenerative conditions. The mechanisms through which melatonin acts, the best dosage, and its long-term effectiveness are still being researched. This review underscores the potential benefits of melatonin as a supplementary treatment for neurodegenerative disorders in older adults, stressing the necessity for additional studies to confirm its efficacy and standardize its use in treatment plans."

    "abstract": "Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) enzymes are critical in repairing DNA damage induced by chemotherapy and/or radiation. Due to PARP's role in DNA repair, inhibiting PARP leads to genomic instability and accumulation of damaged cells in cell cycle arrest. Previous studies have shown that PARP1 activation contributes to the development of various malignant disorders, and using PARP inhibitors is a promising intervention in these diseases. However, PARP activation is also common in neurological and inflammatory disorders. PARP inhibitors were studied in preclinical models of neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's, Huntington's, and Alzheimer's Disease (AD). In neurodegenerative disorders like AD, activated PARP1 induces Aβ and forms Tau tangles, worsening cognitive symptoms. PARP inhibitors are currently used in combination therapy with chemotherapy drugs, including cisplatin and temozolomide, which are all described as having significant rates of central and peripheral nervous system side-effects, raising the potential question of using PARP inhibition not only as a cancer treatment but as an approach to mitigate the toxicity of the cancer drugs. This review will summarize evidence for the potential use of PARP inhibitors for neurologic disorders and discuss future prospects of how PARP inhibitors could be repurposed as neuroprotective agents against the cognitive complications of chemotherapeutic drugs."

Past studies have also linked cirrhosis patients with poorer influenza outcomes following admissions. To compare how patients with liver cirrhosis fared when admitted for COVID-19 as compared with influenza in the United States. The National Inpatient Sample (NIS) from 2016 to 2021 was used. The influenza group of cirrhosis patients was extracted for admissions between 2016 and 2019, while the COVID-19 group involved hospitalizations in 2020 and 2021. Baseline characteristics and differences in outcomes were compared between cirrhosis patients with COVID-19 versus influenza. We recruited 59,590 cirrhosis patients, among whom 6800 (11.4%) had influenza and 52790 (88.6%) were infected with COVID-19. COVID-19 cases were younger, with more patients having dyslipidemia, diabetes, chronic kidney disease (CKD), obesity, and dementia, but fewer patients were smokers, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), history of stroke, history of myocardial infarction, drug abuse, alcohol abuse, chronic ischemic heart disease (IHD), asthma, COPD, and cancer. Our propensity-score matched sample had 6670 cases with COVID-19 and 6670 with influenza. COVID-19 patients were more likely to suffer from hyponatremia, acute myocardial infarction, cardiogenic shock, severe septic shock, mechanical ventilation use, prolonged mechanical ventilation use, cardiac arrest, acute ischemic stroke, acute kidney injury, and all-cause death, but fewer cases with ascites, and hepatorenal syndrome. The characteristics of cirrhosis patients admitted with COVID-19 differed from those admitted for influenza, with COVID-19 showing a higher mortality risk and varying differences in other complications."

    "abstract": "Many studies have linked greater social participation to less cognitive decline with aging. Understanding of how social participation transitions can be associated with older adults' cognitive function is crucial. We analyzed histories of social participation among middle-aged (50-64 years, n = 1900) and older (65+ years, n = 2500) participants in the Taiwan Longitudinal Study on Aging. We applied sequence analysis to define clustered social participation and work history in 1996, 1999, 2003, 2007, and 2011. We applied linear regression models for the associations between cluster membership and cognitive function in 2015, measured with the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire (SPMSQ). We used multinomial regression analysis to explore the factors related to belonging to a cluster. In middle-aged adults, participation in multiple social activities was associated with higher cognition scores. Working and multiple activity participation among older adults were associated with higher scores. More active patterns of social participation were found for men, at younger ages, and among non-urban residents. Our study findings support the value of social engagement and work involvement for healthy cognitive aging. Additionally, we identified subgroups that were more likely to be socially engaged."

    "abstract": "Vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) inhibitors are often prescribed for the treatment of hyperkinetic movement disorders such as tics, stereotypy, tardive dyskinesia and chorea. These dopamine depleters have been FDA approved in adults for the treatment of chorea in Huntington's disease and tardive dyskinesia. Use of VMAT2 inhibitors in pediatric hyperkinetic movement disorders, however, is limited due to lack of pediatric FDA approval. We review the real-world prescribing practices and patient experiences with VMAT2 inhibitors in children. We performed a retrospective chart review of patients treated with VMAT2 inhibitors at a pediatric movement disorders clinic from 2011 to 2023. Demographics, indication, medical history, and clinical notes were reviewed. We identified 340 pediatric patients (65.3% male, average age 11.9 years) who had been prescribed a VMAT2 inhibitor for a variety of hyperkinetic movement disorders (359 total prescriptions) at our large pediatric movement disorders center. Of the 359 prescriptions for VMAT2 inhibitors, 94% included tetrabenazine, 4.6% deutetrabenazine, and 1.4% valbenazine. Most common clinical indication was tics (73.5%), followed by chorea (9.1%) and self-injurious stereotypy (7.1%). Of these prescriptions, 75.8% (N = 275) successfully commenced treatment. Most patients (62.8%) had clinical improvement with an average Clinical Global Impression-Improvement of 1.8 (±1.2), indicating \"very much\" or \"much\" improved, but 11.5% experienced no improvement in symptoms. Most patients (63.9%) reported some side effects, most commonly drowsiness; however, only 35 (10.1%) necessitated discontinuation due to side effects. Seven patients were transitioned from tetrabenazine to deutetrabenazine with resolution of side effects, and one to valbenazine with similar effect. Of the 359 prescriptions, 194 (54%) experienced at least one denial from insurance companies; 24.2% were unable to initiate treatment due to barriers such as insurance denials and 19.6% expressed financial concerns regarding medication affordability. Our study suggests that VMAT2 inhibitors are effective for treating pediatric hyperkinetic movement disorders. Furthermore, this study provides insights into barriers to access to these drugs by pediatric patients."

    "abstract": "Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited, neurodegenerative disorder caused by the expansion of an unstable CAG repeat sequence in the Huntingtin (HTT) gene. The prevalence of HD, allelic diversity, rate of novel expansions and the clinical correlates vary across populations. We analyzed the diversity of alleles and their clinical correlates and examined the inheritance patterns and the pattern of instability of CAG repeats in a few families. Clinical history and pedigree structure were collected from records or through interviews between 2016 and 2019. Genetic testing at the HD locus was done on clinical suspicion, or relatedness, after counseling. Descriptive statistics and correlation analysis were used. Expanded repeats were detected in 239 individuals, including 232 who were symptomatic and 7 presymptomatic relatives. The number of CAG repeats (mean = 45.6) and age at onset (mean = 39.2 years) showed a strong inverse correlation (<i>r</i> = -0.67). We found atypical alleles such as 8 intermediate alleles (IA), 12 reduced penetrance alleles and 14 large (>60) expansion alleles corresponding to juvenile HD. Three individuals carried biallelic expansions. Paternal inheritance was more common, and the mean increase in repeats in the available parent-child pairs was 14. Thirty-seven individuals had no family history of HD, with <i>de novo</i> expansion confirmed in three cases. Novel mutations at the HTT locus may not be rare in India. A lack of family history should not exclude appropriate testing. The prevalence of IA and incidence of <i>de novo</i> expansions suggest that there may be a reservoir of alleles prone to expansion."

Due to various neurological conditions, there is a significant number of deaths every year around the world. The healthcare burden is also increasing each year. Development and progress in nanotechnology enable the creation of nanocarriers that transport drugs to the site of disease, thereby enhancing the therapeutic performance of the drug. However, the transport of nanocarrier-based therapeutics to the brain is restricted by barriers such as the Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) and Blood-Cerebrospinal Fluid Barrier (BCFB), which are further impeded by P-glycoproteins. Hence, current research and development focus on overcoming these obstacles. A biomimetic drug delivery system is one of the best ways to overcome these challenges. One of the promising biomimetic drug delivery systems is cell membrane-coated nanoparticles. In this review, we have comprehensively reviewed the recent progress and development in various cell membranes coated nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems for the effective management of a range of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, Glioblastoma, Ischemic Stroke, Huntington's Disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, Glioma, Peripheral Nerve Injury, and Motor Neuron Disorder. We also reviewed the challenges associated with cell membrane-coated nanoparticles, such as biosafety hurdles, toxicity, regulatory requirements, and clinical translation. Ultimately, we provided the conclusions and future research directions that must be investigated to overcome the current limitations."

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and Huntington's disease (HD), represent a significant global health burden due to their progressive and debilitating nature. While the etiology of these disorders is multifaceted, oxidative stress, resulting from an imbalance between the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and neuronal antioxidant stress responses, has emerged as a pivotal factor in their pathogenesis. Amongst the cellular defense mechanisms counteracting oxidative stress, signaling cascades regulated by the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) signaling axis, play a crucial role. Nrf2 signaling is modulated at multiple levels and regulates redox homeostasis and other cellular processes such as expression of neuroprotective genes, resolution of neuroinflammation, stimulating mitochondrial bioenergetics, facilitating cellular repair, and proteostasis. In recent years, the gaseous molecule or gasotransmitter, hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S), was shown to modulate Nrf2-mediated signaling through processes that include disruption of Keap1-Nrf2 interaction, leading to enhanced Nrf2 activation. This review explores the intricate relationship between hydrogen sulfide and Nrf2-Keap1 signaling, highlighting their potential to counteract neurodegenerative processes. The interplay between H<sub>2</sub>S and Nrf2 signaling underscores their potential as endogenous regulators of cellular resilience against neurodegeneration. Understanding how gasotransmitters fine-tune the Nrf2-Keap1 pathway opens up new avenues for therapeutic interventions in these neurodegenerative disorders. By elucidating how gasotransmitters influence Nrf2-mediated responses, we aim to underscore promising therapeutic strategies that target oxidative damage, modulate neuroinflammation, and enhance neuronal survival pathways in neurodegenerative diseases."

    "abstract": "Huntington's disease (HD) is a life-limiting, progressive monogenic neurodegenerative disorder characterised by chorea, hypokinesis and psychosocial symptoms. HD is characterised by a variable CAG expansion in exon 1 of the HTT gene, which encodes the huntingtin (htt) protein. This expansion results in an extended polyglutamine tract, which is widely thought to confer a toxic gain of function on the protein that is responsible for disease progression. Most individuals with HD are heterozygous for this mutation, meaning that loss of wild-type htt function may also contribute to disease pathology. We previously identified that the recycling of synaptic vesicle proteins at the presynapse was specifically disrupted in striatal neurons from a preclinical model of HD, the Htt<sup>Q140/Q140</sup> knockin mouse. This defect was only revealed during high activity and, notably, was due to loss of wild-type htt function. The dominant endocytosis mode at the presynapse during high activity is activity-dependent bulk endocytosis (ADBE). Therefore, we determined whether dysfunction in this pathway was linked to this recycling defect. We revealed that three independent neuronal subtypes derived from Htt<sup>Q140/Q140</sup> mice displayed enhanced recruitment, but no change in the extent of ADBE via the evoked uptake of fluid phase markers. Importantly, this phenotype was due to a loss of wild-type htt function, since depletion of htt in Htt<sup>+/+</sup> neurons mimicked the defect, and removal of mutant htt from Htt<sup>Q140/Q140</sup> neurons did not correct this dysfunction. Neurons from Htt<sup>Q140/+</sup> mice, which mimic the human condition, also displayed increased activity-dependent triggering of ADBE, suggesting that htt haploinsufficiency may be responsible. This was confirmed by the inability of zinc finger proteins that selectively target mutant htt to correct this defect in Htt<sup>Q140/+</sup> neurons. Therefore, htt haploinsufficiency drives dysfunction in a key endocytosis mode that is dominant during high neuronal activity, providing a potential mechanism for circuit dysfunction that results in neurodegeneration in later life in HD."

This review explores key epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation, histone modifications, non-coding RNAs, and chromatin remodeling, that contribute to neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and Huntington's disease (HD). Pharmacological interventions such as DNA methylation modulators, histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, and non-coding RNA therapies have shown potential in restoring normal gene function. Advanced approaches, including CRISPR-dCas9 epigenetic editing, synthetic transcription factors (STFs), and Yamanaka factor-mediated cellular rejuvenation, offer precise control over disease-associated gene expression. Despite these advancements, several challenges and controversies remain, including off-target effects, delivery limitations, long-term safety concerns, and ethical implications. Emerging research focuses on multi-target combination therapies, integrating epigenetic interventions with stem cell therapy, immune checkpoint inhibitors, and AI-driven precision medicine. Future directions involve the development of non-invasive drug delivery systems, AI-powered biomarker discovery, and personalized epigenome-based treatments to enhance therapeutic outcomes. As research advances, epigenetic reprogramming holds the potential to revolutionize neurodegenerative disease treatment, providing more effective, individualized, and disease-modifying interventions."

    "abstract": "Research into lactylation modifications across various target organs in both health and disease has gained significant attention. Many essential life processes and the onset of diseases are not only related to protein abundance but are also primarily regulated by various post-translational protein modifications. Lactate, once considered merely a byproduct of anaerobic metabolism, has emerged as a crucial energy substrate and signaling molecule involved in both physiological and pathological processes within the nervous system. Furthermore, recent studies have emphasized the significant role of lactate in numerous neurological diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, acute cerebral ischemic stroke, multiple sclerosis, Huntington's disease, and myasthenia gravis. The purpose of this review is to synthesize the current research on lactate and lactylation modifications in neurological diseases, aiming to clarify their mechanisms of action and identify potential therapeutic targets. As such, this work provides an overview of the metabolic regulatory roles of lactate in various disorders, emphasizing its involvement in the regulation of brain function. Additionally, the specific mechanisms of brain lactate metabolism are discussed, suggesting the unique roles of lactate in modulating brain function. As a critical aspect of lactate function, lactylation modifications, including both histone and non-histone lactylation, are explored, with an emphasis on recent advancements in identifying the key regulatory enzymes of such modifications, such as lactylation writers and erasers. The effects and specific mechanisms of abnormal lactate metabolism in diverse neurological diseases are summarized, revealing that lactate acts as a signaling molecule in the regulation of brain functions and that abnormal lactate metabolism is implicated in the progression of various neurological disorders. Future research should focus on further elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying lactate and lactylation modifications and exploring their potential as therapeutic targets for neurological diseases."

    "abstract": "Neuroinflammation contributes to a wide range of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and multiple sclerosis. It is driven by non-neuronal glial cells, mainly microglia and astrocytes. Microglia are the resident immune cells of the central nervous system, while astrocytes are the main support cells for neuronal functions but can also participate in neuroimmune responses. Both these glial cell types can become reactive upon detection of certain endogenous intracellular molecules that appear in the extracellular space under specific circumstances; these can be pathology-associated abnormal structures, such as amyloid β proteins, or damage-associated molecular patterns released from injured cells, including their mitochondria. Once in the extracellular space, damage-associated molecular patterns act as ligands for specific pattern recognition receptors expressed by glia inducing their reactivity and neuroimmune responses. This review considers the following mitochondrial damage-associated molecular patterns: heme, cytochrome c, cardiolipin, adenosine triphosphate, mitochondrial DNA, mitochondrial transcription factor A, N-formyl peptides, and the tricarboxylic acid cycle metabolites: succinate, fumarate, and itaconate. We describe their well-established functions as damage-associated molecular patterns of the peripheral tissues before summarizing available evidence indicating these molecules may also play significant roles in the neuroimmune processes of the central nervous system. We highlight the pattern recognition receptors that mitochondrial damage-associated molecular patterns interact with and the cellular signaling mechanisms they modulate. Our review demonstrates that some mitochondrial damage-associated molecular patterns, such as cytochrome c, adenosine triphosphate, and mitochondrial transcription factor A, have already demonstrated significant effects on the central nervous system. In contrast, others including cardiolipin, mitochondrial DNA, N-formyl peptides, succinate, fumarate, and itaconate, will require additional studies corroborating their roles as damageassociated molecular patterns in the central nervous system. For all of the reviewed mitochondrial damage-associated molecular patterns, there is a shortage of studies using human cells and tissues, which is identified as a significant knowledge gap. We also assess the need for targeted research on the effects of mitochondrial damage-associated molecular patterns in the central nervous system pathologies where their roles are understudied. Such studies could identify novel treatment strategies for multiple neurodegenerative diseases, which are characterized by chronic neuroinflammation and currently lack effective therapies."

    "abstract": "Neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative illnesses constitute a global health issue and a foremost economic burden since they are a large cause of incapacity and death worldwide. Altogether, the burden of neurological disorders has increased considerably over the past 30 years because of population aging. Overall, neurological diseases significantly impair cognitive and motor functions and their incidence will increase as societies age and the world's population continues to grow. Autism spectrum disorder, motor neuron disease, encephalopathy, epilepsy, stroke, ataxia, Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington's disease, and Parkinson's disease represent a non-exhaustive list of neurological illnesses. These affections are due to perturbations in cellular homeostasis leading to the progressive injury and death of neurons in the nervous system. Among the common features of neurological handicaps, we find protein aggregation, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and mitochondrial impairment in the target tissues, e.g., the brain, cerebellum, and spinal cord. The high energy requirements of neurons and their inability to produce sufficient adenosine triphosphate by glycolysis, are responsible for their dependence on functional mitochondria for their integrity. Reactive oxygen species, produced along with the respiration process within mitochondria, can lead to oxidative stress, which compromises neuronal survival. Besides having an essential role in energy production and oxidative stress, mitochondria are indispensable for an array of cellular processes, such as amino acid metabolism, iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis, calcium homeostasis, intrinsic programmed cell death (apoptosis), and intraorganellar signaling. Despite the progress made in the last decades in the understanding of a growing number of genetic and molecular causes of central nervous diseases, therapies that are effective to diminish or halt neuronal dysfunction/death are rare. Given the genetic complexity responsible for neurological disorders, the development of neuroprotective strategies seeking to preserve mitochondrial homeostasis is a realistic challenge to lastingly diminish the harmful evolution of these pathologies and so to recover quality of life. A promising candidate is the neuroglobin, a globin superfamily member of 151 amino acids, which is found at high levels in the brain, the eye, and the cerebellum. The protein, which localizes to mitochondria, is involved in electron transfer, oxygen storage and defence against oxidative stress; hence, possessing neuroprotective properties. This review surveys up-to-date knowledge and emphasizes on existing investigations regarding neuroglobin physiological functions, which remain since its discovery in 2000 under intense debate and the possibility of using neuroglobin either by gene therapy or its direct delivery into the brain to treat neurological disorders."

A crucial factor contributing to this decline is the dysfunction of mitochondria, particularly those located at synapses.

In contrast, non-synaptic mitochondria primarily involve cellular metabolism and long-term energy supply. Both pools of mitochondria differ in their form, proteome, functionality, and cellular role. The proper functioning of synaptic mitochondria depends on processes such as mitochondrial dynamics, transport, and quality control. However, synaptic mitochondria are particularly vulnerable to age-associated damage, characterized by oxidative stress, impaired energy production, and calcium dysregulation. These changes compromise synaptic transmission, reducing synaptic activity and cognitive decline during aging. In the context of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's, the decline of synaptic mitochondrial function is even more pronounced. These diseases are marked by pathological protein accumulation, disrupted mitochondrial dynamics, and heightened oxidative stress, accelerating synaptic dysfunction and neuronal loss. Due to their specialized role and location, synaptic mitochondria are among the first organelles to exhibit dysfunction, underscoring their critical role in disease progression. This review delves into the main differences at structural and functional levels between synaptic and nonsynaptic mitochondria, emphasizing the vulnerability of synaptic mitochondria to the aging process and neurodegeneration. These approaches highlight the potential of targeting synaptic mitochondria to mitigate age-associated cognitive impairment and synaptic degeneration. This review emphasizes the distinct vulnerabilities of hippocampal synaptic mitochondria, highlighting their essential role in sustaining brain function throughout life and their promise as therapeutic targets for safeguarding the cognitive capacities of people of advanced age."

    "title": "Recent Advances in Visual Dysfunction and Ocular Biomarkers in Neurological Disorders.",
    "abstract": "The visual system is an integral part of the central nervous system, and visual symptoms often serve as an early manifestation of underlying neurological pathologies. This review synthesizes recent findings on visual dysfunction in various neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases. These reports emphasize that ophthalmological symptoms are increasingly recognized as part of a broader spectrum of neurological conditions, enhancing their clinical relevance for differential diagnosis and symptom management. Non-invasive, high-resolution ocular imaging techniques can identify retinal pathologies at the subcellular level. Additionally, the non-invasive visual functional assay, electroretinography, can further corroborate findings of retinal pathology. Distinct retinal changes are detectable in the early stages of progressive neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease, and are strongly correlated with cognitive decline in conditions like Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and Joubert syndrome. These findings highlight the clinical potential of retinal imaging for risk assessment, diagnosis, and monitoring the progression of diseases with insidious onset. Furthermore, this review emphasizes the retina's accessibility as a key component in investigating the underlying pathophysiology of neurological conditions. Additional clinical and basic science research is needed to better understand the distinct and potentially interconnected contributions of the brain and retina to specific visual symptoms. Investigating suitable preclinical mouse models will be vital for developing and refining novel ocular diagnostic markers, which are important for symptom management and the advancement of therapeutic strategies."

    "abstract": "RNA therapeutics present a disruptive technology that has changed the drug discovery and manufacturing landscape, which established itself more prominently upon the recent COVID-19 pandemic. RNA therapeutics encompass diverse molecules like antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs), small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs), RNA aptamers, and messenger RNAs (mRNAs), which can function through different mechanisms. RNA therapeutics are witnessing expanding applications across a range of diseases, notably in the treatment of neurological disorders. For instance, ASO therapies like nusinersen for spinal muscular atrophy and eteplirsen for Duchenne muscular dystrophy exemplify successful RNA therapeutic strategies. Emerging ASO treatments for Huntington's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis are also promising, with ongoing clinical trials demonstrating significant reductions in disease-associated proteins. Still, delivery of these molecules remains a pivotal challenge in RNA therapeutics, especially for ASOs in penetrating the blood-brain barrier to target neurological disorders effectively. Nanoparticlebased formulations have emerged as leading strategies to enhance RNA stability, reduce immunogenicity, and improve cellular uptake. Despite these advances, significant hurdles remain, including optimizing pharmacokinetics, minimizing off-target effects, and ensuring sustained therapeutic efficacy. Regulatory frameworks are evolving to accommodate the unique challenges of RNAbased therapies, including ASOs with efforts underway to establish comprehensive guidelines for RNA therapeutics, yet there are also sustainable manufacturing issues that need to be considered for long-term feasibility. By addressing these challenges, RNA therapeutics hold immense potential to revolutionize treatment paradigms for neurological disorders. Looking forward, the future of RNA therapeutics in neurology appears promising but requires continued interdisciplinary collaboration and technological innovation."

    "title": "The Regulatory Roles of REST in the Synaptic Development, Function and Related Neurological Disorders.",
    "abstract": "The synaptic system is the core of the nervous system, coordinating neural communication. Synaptic dysfunctions, including deficits in synaptogenesis, neurotransmission and plasticity, underlie various neurological diseases. Repressor element-1 silencing transcription factor (REST), an epigenetic transcription factor, plays a crucial role in neurodevelopment and neuroprotection by fine-tuning the expression of neuronal genes. REST binds to the RE-1 motif on target genes and recruits cofactors to exert transcriptional regulation. Dysregulation of REST, affecting thousands of downstream neuronal genes, is characteristic of neurological diseases with synaptic dysfunctions, including Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, cerebral ischaemia, bipolar disorder and Kleefstra syndrome. Research on REST-targeted synaptic genes has been ongoing since 1993, using various fundamental and disease neuronal models. However, there has been no comprehensive review to consolidate the scattered knowledge of the regulatory role of REST in the synaptic system. Therefore, we reviewed and identified a list of REST-targeted and -regulated synaptic genes to address this gap. We found that REST plays significant roles in synapse development and function, particularly in the synaptic vesicle cycle, chemical neurotransmission systems and homeostasis of synaptic plasticity. Importantly, approaches to restore REST level in various neurological diseases have successfully rescued REST-targeted synaptic gene expression and ameliorated their synaptic and neuronal functions. This review serves as a foundation for future research on REST and neurological diseases. It aims to delineate the regulatory role of REST in the synaptic system and explore the potential of targeting REST restoration to improve synaptic functions in various neurological conditions."

This paper proposes the Dual-Branch Attention-Enhanced Residual Network (DAERN), a novel deep learning architecture that integrates Dilated Causal Convolutions (DCCBlock) for local gait pattern extraction and Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA) for long-range dependency modeling. A CrossAttention Fusion module enhances feature integration, while SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and Integrated Gradients (IG) improve interpretability, providing clinically relevant insights into gait-based NDD classification. Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) visualizations reveal well-separated clusters corresponding to distinct NDDs categories, demonstrating the model's ability to capture discriminative features. Comprehensive ablation studies validate the contributions of model components and preprocessing strategies, highlighting the significance of each in achieving state-of-the-art classification performance. Experimental evaluations on the Gait in Neurodegenerative Disease (GaitNDD) dataset demonstrate that DAERN achieves an accuracy of 99.64%, an F1-score of 99.65%, and an AUC of 0.9997, significantly outperforming conventional deep learning and machine learning baselines. These findings suggest that DAERN could be a valuable and interpretable tool for clinical gait assessment, aiding in early-stage monitoring and automated screening of NDDs, with potential applications in real-time wearable sensor-based gait analysis."

Prior research has demonstrated that sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (SZC) can enable continued RAASi use in patients with hyperkalemia. This study, GALVANIZE RAASi, sought to describe the proportion of patients with hyperkalemia who had an optimized or maximized RAASi dose after the initiation of outpatient SZC therapy. Using data from a large US insurance claims database from July 2018-December 2022, adults initiating SZC in the outpatient setting (index) while using a RAASi (≥ 7 day overlap with index and ≥ 1 RAASi fill in the 6-month follow-up period) were selected. Sub-studies included patients with baseline diagnosis codes for CKD or HF and patients with ≥ 1 MRA prescription during follow-up. The proportion of patients with an optimized (≥ 50% of target dose) or maximized (≥ 100% of target dose) RAASi dose during follow-up was described. Of the 2973 patients meeting study inclusion criteria who were included in the overall sample, 2549 were included in the CKD sub-study, 879 in the HF sub-study and 395 in the MRA sub-study. In the overall sample, 63.7% of patients had an optimized RAASi dose and 27.2% of patients had a maximized RAASi dose during follow-up, and the results were similar across sub-studies (optimized RAASi dose: 62.9-72.6%; maximized RAASi dose: 26.9-36.1%). In this real-world study of patients with RAASi use after SZC initiation, about two-thirds of patients had an optimized RAASi dose and more than a quarter of patients had a maximized RAASi dose within 6 months of starting SZC. Findings were consistent across sub-studies of patients with CKD, HF and treatment with MRA. SZC may support the maintenance of optimal RAASi therapy; however, further comparative analyses are warranted. Graphical abstract available for this article."

Collectively, these studies reveal that progranulin has diverse roles as a cell signaling molecule that regulates lysosomal function, immune processes, and growth. Given the functional and pathological implications of aberrant progranulin expression, we also summarize the mechanisms of progranulin regulation. We then highlight therapeutic strategies for progranulin upregulation. Ultimately, we explore the relationship between progranulin function and regulation with the goals of identifying key open questions and facilitating rational therapeutic development."

We delve into the dynamic ecosystem of gut microbiota, examining factors influencing its composition and the bidirectional communication established via the gut-brain axis. Emerging evidence suggests that gut microbiota can modulate neurodegenerative disease progression through mechanisms including inflammatory responses, production of neuroactive substances, and regulation of neurotransmitters. Furthermore, we discuss the potential therapeutic implications of targeting gut microbiota with probiotics, prebiotics, and postbiotics. While promising, these interventions face challenges and limitations that must be addressed through ongoing research. Understanding the role of gut microbiota in neurodegenerative diseases is crucial for developing innovative therapeutic strategies and improving patient outcomes."

    "abstract": "With the gradual advancement of research methods and technologies, various biological processes have been identified as playing roles in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. However, current descriptions of these biological processes do not fully explain the onset, progression, and development of these conditions. Therefore, exploration of the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases remains a valuable area of research. This review summarizes the potential common pathogeneses of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington's disease, frontotemporal lobar dementia, and Lewy body disease. Research findings have indicated that several common biological processes, including aging, genetic factors, progressive neuronal dysfunction, neuronal death and apoptosis, protein misfolding and aggregation, neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, axonal transport defects, and gut microbiota dysbiosis, are involved in the pathogenesis of these six neurodegenerative diseases. Based on current information derived from diverse areas of research, these biological processes may form complex pathogenic networks that lead to distinctive types of neuronal death in neurodegenerative diseases. Furthermore, promoting the regeneration of damaged neurons may be achievable through the repair of affected neural cells if the underlying pathogenesis can be prevented or reversed. Hence, these potential common biological processes may represent only very small, limited elements within numerous intricate pathogenic networks associated with neurodegenerative diseases. In clinical treatment, interfering with any single biological process has proven insufficient to completely halt the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, future research on the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases should focus on uncovering the complex pathogenic networks, rather than isolating individual biological processes. Based on this, therapies that aim to block or reverse various targets involved in the potential pathogenic mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases may be promising directions, as current treatment methods that focus on halting a single pathogenic factor have not achieved satisfactory efficacy."

Dysregulation of this system has been implicated in several dementia-related neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). This review aims to synthesize current research on the involvement of the OX system in dementia-related neurological diseases, focusing on its effects on cognitive function and its potential as a therapeutic target. The OX system, encompassing hypothalamic neuropeptides and receptors (OX1R and OX2R), exhibits dysregulation in neurodegenerative diseases associated with dementia. Changes in OX concentrations strongly correlate with cognitive decline, and this correlation varies with disease progression. OX regulates essential molecular mechanisms, including neuronal survival, synaptic plasticity, neural network integrity, and circadian rhythm stability-processes impaired as cognitive deficits intensify. These findings emphasize OX's critical and context-dependent role in cellular resilience and cognitive function. OX system emerges as a multifaceted therapeutic target for dementia-related cognitive impairment. Its effects vary across disease stages, initially offering neuroprotection but later contributing to pathology. Moreover, OX's involvement in circadian rhythm regulation complicates its clinical utility, as disruptions exacerbate cognitive deficits. These opposing functions highlight the need for tailored, stage-specific interventions to maximize cognitive benefits while minimizing adverse signaling."

PolyQ expansions are associated with neurodegenerative diseases like Huntington's disease, and <i>Drosophila</i> is a valuable model organism for studying these diseases due to its genetic tractability and short generation time. We found that expressing a polyQ protein in class IV da neurons caused significant locomotion deficits. Specifically, larvae with polyQ expression exhibited slower crawling speed and increased turn frequency, indicating impaired movement. The most intriguing finding of our study was that electrically silencing class IV da neurons completely rescued the locomotion deficits caused by polyQ expression. By expressing a potassium channel that makes the neurons less active, we effectively reversed the locomotion defects. This suggests that modulating the activity of these neurons could be a promising therapeutic approach for treating polyQ diseases. Our findings have significant implications for understanding polyQ diseases and developing new therapeutic approaches. By electrically silencing these neurons, we may be preventing the harmful effects of polyQ-induced cation channels, which are thought to disrupt cellular function. This opens up exciting possibilities for exploring electrical silencing as a potential treatment for polyQ diseases, offering hope for future therapies that target the underlying mechanisms of these devastating conditions."

Explore the relationship between abnormal spontaneous resting-state activity and atrophy in HD-specific brain regions and clarify effective connectivity changes among them across different stages of HD. Amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) analysis was used to detect abnormal spontaneous neural activity; voxel-based morphometry analysis was applied to assess atrophy; spectral dynamic causal model (DCM) was conducted to estimate regional effective connectivity between HD participants and healthy controls, as well as between preclinical mutation carriers and symptomatic patients. Voxel-wise whole-brain ALFF analysis identified the bilateral caudate nucleus, putamen, and motor cortex as HD-specific brain regions. ALFF changes in the caudate nucleus and putamen correlated with their respective volumetric atrophy, whereas ALFF changes in the motor cortex preceded its atrophy in the HD preclinical stage. Subsequently, DCM revealed increased inhibitory connectivity from the bilateral caudate nucleus to the motor cortex in HD participants compared to controls. Moreover, compared to preclinical mutation carriers, symptomatic patients showed decreased inhibitory connectivity from the right putamen to the bilateral caudate nucleus, with nonlinear relationships with motor scores. Our results indicate that striatal atrophy and hyper-inhibition of caudate-motorial connectivity might contribute to the regional function alterations in HD. Furthermore, disruption of inhibitory connectivity in the striatal-motor circuit may play an important role in the emergence of motor symptoms."

BA acceleration was the residual from regressing BA on chronological age; positive values indicated a biologically older individual. PhenoAge acceleration showed stronger associations than KDMAge acceleration. Per the 1-SD increase in PhenoAge acceleration; HRs (95% CIs) were observed at 1.18 (1.17-1.19) for baseline to first CRMD; 1.24 (1.22-1.26) for first CRMD to CRMM; 1.25 (1.22-1.27) for baseline to death; 1.13 (1.11-1.15) for first CRMD to death; and 1.09 (1.06-1.12) for CRMM to death. Biologically older individuals by PhenoAge acceleration showed greater reductions in CRMD-free and total life expectancy than those by KDMAge acceleration. Age, socioeconomic status, education, smoking status, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and diet-modified risks for specific transitions. BA acceleration, particularly PhenoAge acceleration, relates to higher CRMM progression risk and shorter life expectancy. Combining BA acceleration with sociodemographic or lifestyle factors improves risk identification for specific transitions. BA acceleration offers the potential to guide CRMM prevention across its entire progression."

    "title": "Restoring endogenous Dlg4/PSD95 expression by an artificial transcription factor ameliorates cognitive and motor learning deficits in the R6/2 mouse model of Huntington's disease.",
    "abstract": "Huntington's disease (HD) is an incurable hereditary disorder caused by an expansion of CAG repeats in exon 1 of the Huntingtin gene (HTT). HD is characterized by motor dysfunction and cognitive decline. The pathophysiology of HD begins in cortico-striatal circuits and later spreads to other brain regions, notably the hippocampus. At the cellular level, structural changes in synapses have been observed prior to neuronal degeneration, significantly disrupting the formation and maintenance of neuronal circuits. The postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95, hereafter Dlg4/PSD95) is a key synaptic plasticity protein reduced in HD and other neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Epigenetic silencing of plasticity and memory genes contributes to AD pathology and cognitive impairment. To restore endogenous Dlg4/PSD95 expression in AD, we previously developed an epigenetic editing strategy where a zinc finger DNA-binding domain targeting the Dlg4/PSD95 gene promoter was fused to the transactivation domain VP64 and driven under a CMV promoter. AAV-PhP.B-mediated delivery of this artificial transcription factor (ATF) CMV-PSD95-6ZF-VP64 improved cognition in an AD mouse model. Here, we assessed the therapeutic potential of AAV9-mediated delivery of the synapsin-driven ATF PSD95-6ZF-VP64 in the R6/2 HD mouse model. Consistent with the previous studies, R6/2 mice exhibited reduced hippocampal Dlg4/PSD95 mRNA and protein levels in young adulthood (7 weeks), which persisted into early adulthood (14 weeks). Starting at adolescents (4 weeks), the R6/2 mice also displayed motor (i.e., accelerated rotarod) and cognitive (i.e., Barnes maze and object location memory) impairments. In wild-type primary hippocampal cultures, AAV9-PSD95-6ZF-VP64 led to an increase in synaptic PSD-95 clusters and spine size. Intracerebroventricular injections of neonatal R6/2 mice with AAV9-PSD95-6ZF-VP64 elevated hippocampal Dlg4/PSD95 expression levels to those observed in control non-transgenic mice. Importantly, AAV9-PSD95-6ZF-VP64 effectively improved hippocampal-dependent deficits in spatial learning and memory in young adult HD mice, as well as impairments in motor coordination and motor skill learning, with these benefits persisting into adulthood. This work validates Dlg4/PSD95 as a key player in the prodromal phase of HD pathology and establishes the ATF PSD95-6ZF-VP64 as an attractive therapeutic tool for treating the disease's early phase."

    "abstract": "Amyloid fibril formation is a hallmark of various neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington's (HD), Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's disease. The protein aggregation process involves slow nucleation events followed by rapid growth and elongation of formed fibrils. Understanding the pathways of amyloid formation is key to development of novel therapeutic agents that can interfere with the pathogenic protein misfolding events. Recent studies of aggregation by polypeptides from Alzheimer's and Huntington's disease have identified the importance of a poorly understood secondary nucleation process that may even be the dominant source of protein aggregate formation. Here, we focus on the polyglutamine-expansion disorder HD and employ mechanistic and structural studies to study different aspects of secondary nucleation in the aggregation of huntingtin Exon 1 (HttEx1). Notably, we apply high-speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM) to directly observe the process on the single-particle level and in real time. Our observations show unique features of the amyloid formation dynamics in real time, including secondary nucleation, elongation, and the formation of large bundles of fibrils as a result of nucleated branching. We examine the role of HttEx1 flanking segments during the aggregation process, revealing that the N-terminal Htt<sup>NT</sup> segment exhibits a clear primary nucleation-aggregation-enhancing ability; however, it does not seem to induce or affect the secondary nucleation process. The obtained results illuminate the complex aggregation process of HttEx1 and have implications for attempts to inhibit or modulate it for therapeutic purposes."

Here, we ask if transplanting human glial progenitor cells (hGPCs) into adult R6/2 HD mice can ameliorate the phenotype, and how diseased host neurons are affected by healthy glia. We find that the introduction of hGPCs into the striata of adult R6/2 HD mice indeed slows their motor and cognitive decline and extends survival. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) reveals that while genes associated with synaptic development and structure are downregulated in R6/2 striatal neurons, their transcription is partially rescued by healthy glia. Rabies labeling reveals that while dendritic complexity and spine density are deficient in R6/2 striatal neurons, each is largely restored by hGPC engraftment. These findings suggest that glial replacement in HD leads to partial normalization of neuronal gene expression, along with a restoration of dendritic complexity and delay in disease progression."

Multiple testing correction used false discovery rate (FDR) with significance thresholds of OR >1.5 or <0.5 and FDR <0.05. Our cohort included 29.2% non-White participants versus 10-15% in traditional studies. We identified 22 significant associations across seven organ systems. Three novel discoveries included delayed postmyocardial infarction pericarditis (adjusted OR = 4.80), contact dermatitis (adjusted OR = 1.84), and carotid artery aneurysm (adjusted OR = 2.21). Other significant associations included drug-induced lupus (adjusted OR = 4.32), autoimmune hepatitis (adjusted OR = 2.43), and restricting-type eating disorders (adjusted OR = 4.00).

    "abstract": "Huntington's disease (HD) is characterized by neuronal dysfunction and degeneration that varies markedly by brain region and cell type. We previously showed that CAG repeat expansion in exon 1 of the <i>mHTT</i> gene correlates with increased expression of the mismatch repair genes <i>MSH2</i> and <i>MSH3</i> in striatal medium spiny neurons <sup>1</sup> , and demonstrated that, in the striatum and cerebral cortex of individuals with HD, hundreds of genes are dysregulated in neuronal cell types carrying somatically expanded CAG repeat in <i>mHTT</i> <sup>1,2</sup> . Here we employ comprehensive epigenetic profiling in specific neuronal and glial cell types from the human striatum, cerebral cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum of control and HD donor samples to identify cell type- and species-specific transcriptional control mechanisms in the mismatch repair genes <i>MSH2</i> , <i>MSH3</i> and <i>FAN1</i> that can explain the specificity of somatic CAG expansion in the first stage of HD. In the second, toxic phase of HD we identify two distinct epigenetic mechanisms that disrupt regulation of hundreds of genes in the majority of HD MSNs, including several that cause haploinsufficient neurological disorders. Our data support a mechanistic model of HD pathogenesis in which regulation of mismatch repair gene transcription determines the selectivity of somatic expansion, and DNA methylation stabilizes the toxic effect of mutant huntingtin on HD-modifying proteins MED15 and TCERG1, which regulate enhancer function and transcription elongation."

Although an expanded CAG allele is the causal mutation for HD, there is evidence that somatic expansion may not be the only disease driver. We report here that double strand breaks (DSBs) drive HD toxicity by an independent mechanism from somatic expansion. The mutant HD protein inhibits non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) activity, leading to the accumulation of DSBs. DSBs promote transcriptional pathology in mice that cannot expand their CAG tracts somatically. Conversely, Inhibition of DSBs reverses neuronal toxicity in animals that undergo somatic expansion. Although they coexist in neurons, DSBs and somatic expansion are independent therapeutic targets for HD."

    "abstract": "The central nervous system is susceptible to gradual decline with age, affecting all types of glial cells in the process. Compared to other glial cells, the oligodendroglial lineage is highly vulnerable to ageing and undergoes significant characteristic changes that impact upon its structure and impair its physiological functions. Therefore, the ageing and degeneration of oligodendroglia become major risk factors for neurodegenerative diseases. During the age-related disease process, changes in oligodendroglia lead to a decline in their ability to regenerate myelin and respond to the aged microenvironment, which are closely linked to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, facilitating the emergence of these diseases in older populations. In this chapter, we introduce the physiological changes of oligodendroglia during ageing and the related mechanisms and then summarise their pathophysiological contributions to age-related cognitive disorders. Finally, we discuss potential therapeutic strategies that target oligodendroglia for future research on neurodegenerative diseases."

Consolidating current understanding regarding these unique difficulties would better inform health and social care services and enable more tailored and appropriate service delivery. The proposed scoping review will summarise evidence from studies that provide evidence about people with dementia, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease or motor neurone disease who live alone. This protocol sets out the processes that will be followed in the subsequent scoping review to ensure that a transparent, rigorous and reproducible approach is used to identify, select and synthesise relevant evidence. This scoping review protocol uses well-established methodology outlined by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic review and Meta-Analysis and the Joanna Briggs Institute. Relevant publications will be searched using PubMed, Web of Science Core Collection, CINAHL and AgeLine via EBSCOhost and EMBASE, PsycInfo and Social Policy and Practice via Ovid. Grey literature will be searched via Google looking specifically for pdf documents. As there was no previous review on the topic, no date restrictions will be applied to the searches. Piloting of the search strategy provided an estimate of the number of titles likely to require title and abstract screening, which, along with prior experience from a similar review approach, informed the feasibility of the proposed strategy. For research publications, a two-stage screening approach will be undertaken. The first stage will involve screening titles and abstracts for relevant literature on people with neurodegenerative conditions living alone in the community. The second stage will involve full text screening of selected articles. For grey literature, the first 20 PDFs per website identified in Google will be downloaded and screened. Summary data will be extracted from publications selected for inclusion. Data synthesis will involve tabulating study characteristics and findings and preparing narrative summaries to identify commonalities, gaps and areas for future research. Ethical approval is not required for this review, as the information included is in the public domain and people with lived experience are consultees rather than research participants. Consultation with people with lived experience, stakeholders and experts linked with the National Institute for Health and Care Research Policy Research Unit in Dementia and Neurodegeneration University of Exeter will help to ensure the relevance and applicability of findings. Dissemination will include a policy report and peer-reviewed publications aimed at informing policy, practice and improving support services for people living alone with neurodegenerative conditions."

The phase 3 study reported here assessed the safety, tolerability, and effectiveness of repeated cycles of rimabotulinumtoxinB (RIMA) injections in adults with troublesome sialorrhea. In this phase 3, open-label multicenter study, 187 adult participants with troublesome sialorrhea due to Parkinson disease (65.8%), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (13.9%), and other etiologies (20.3%) received up to 4 cycles of RIMA treatment (3500 U every 11-15 weeks). Participants (69% male, 31% female; mean age 64.1 years) had sialorrhea for a mean of 3.2 years at baseline with a mean Unstimulated Salivary Flow Rate (USFR) of 0.63 ± 0.49 g/min. During the first treatment cycle, RIMA significantly reduced the mean±standard deviation (SD) USFR from baseline to week 4 by - 0.34 ± 0.37 g/min (p < 0.0001), and efficacy was maintained through week 13 (- 0.14 ± 0.29 g/min; p < 0.0001). Reductions were maintained at subsequent injection cycles 2-4, with mean absolute USFRs at weeks 4 and 13 of each cycle similar to those of cycle 1. Most adverse events (AEs) were mild, and the most commonly reported AEs in each cycle that were considered to be treatment-related were dry mouth (≤ 15.5% participants/cycle) and dental caries (≤ 6.0% participants/cycle). This study demonstrates that RIMA 3500 U safely reduces saliva production over repeated treatment cycles through 1 year, thereby supporting its utility in the management of troublesome sialorrhea in adults.

    "abstract": "The kynurenine (KYN) pathway is a branch of tryptophan metabolic cascade. The KYN pathway is unique since it generates multiple neuroactive metabolites, including 3-hydroxykynurenine (3-HK), kynurenic acid (KYNA), quinolinic acid (QUIN), and picolinic acid (PIC). Whereas KYNA and PIC are neuroprotective, 3-HK and QUIN are potently neurotoxic and attribute to major neurodegenerative diseases like schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, bipolar disorder, and depression. It is increasingly evident that the ratio(s) between the neurotoxic versus neuroprotective metabolites may help predict the manifestations of disease versus health. Therefore, high-throughput platforms for determining the relative levels of these kynurenine metabolites in biofluids offer considerable potential. Current analytical tools for studying the KYN pathway include assays of branching enzymes, PCR, immunoanalysis, and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Neither of these offers high-throughput, cost-effective analyses suited for clinical or drug-screening applications. In this report, a Laser Desorption Ionization Mass Spectrometry (LDI-MS) method is described using SBA-15 mesoporous silica. The system allows fast, high-resolution relative quantitation of neurotoxic kynurenines using targeted metabolomics on conventional Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-of-Flight (mass spectrometry) (MALDI-TOF) platforms."

Huntington's disease (HD), a genetic neurodegenerative disorder, can significantly affect work capacity. Anosognosia (lack of awareness of impairments) and avoidant coping are common in HD but remain unexplored in relation to work outcomes.ObjectiveThis study investigated the relationships between anosognosia, coping styles, and work capacity in individuals with pre-motor manifest and motor manifest HD.MethodsUtilizing the HD-Work dataset, we analyzed motor and cognitive functioning, coping styles, work capacity, and anosognosia in participants with pre-motor manifest and motor manifest HD (n = 117). Anosognosia was operationalized through expert rating, participant - proxy, and cognitive - performance discrepancies. Work capacity was measured using the occupation item of the Total Functional Capacity scale, and coping styles were assessed with the <i>Utrechtse Coping Lijst</i>.ResultsAnosognosia was strongly associated with cognitive decline, while avoidant coping was less prevalent. Both anosognosia and avoidance coping were correlated with frontal behaviors but not with work capacity. A positive association between avoidant coping and anosognosia was found. The most common coping style used was passive coping. Participants did not often seek social comfort.ConclusionsThe best predictor of anosognosia was cognitive decline. The positive association between avoidant coping and anosognosia suggested a potential misattribution of avoidant coping to anosognosia. This study emphasized the importance of recognizing avoidant and passive coping strategies in early-stage HD, as well as anosognosia in relation to cognitive decline, even though these factors do not directly impact work capacity."

To gain insights into this molecular mechanism, we compared genome-wide association studies of somatic expansion in blood and somatic expansion-driven HD clinical phenotypes. Here, we show that somatic expansion is driven by a mismatch repair-related process whose genetic modification and consequences show unexpected complexity, including cell-type specificity. The HD clinical trajectory is further modified by non-DNA repair genes that differentially influence measures of cognitive and motor dysfunction. In addition to shared (DNA repair genes MSH3, PMS2 and FAN1) and distinct trans-modifiers, a synonymous CAG-adjacent variant in HTT dramatically hastens motor onset without increasing somatic expansion, while a cis-acting 5'-untranslated region variant promotes blood repeat expansion without influencing clinical HD. Our findings are directly relevant to the therapeutic suppression of expansion in DNA repeat disorders and provide additional clues to HD pathogenic mechanisms beyond somatic expansion."

As a direct precursor to dopamine, L-DOPA is synthesized from L-tyrosine through the action of tyrosine hydroxylase and is subsequently converted into dopamine via aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase. Its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) makes it a crucial therapeutic agent for restoring dopaminergic neurotransmission, thereby influencing motor function, cognition, and neuroprotection. Beyond Parkinson's, L-DOPA's therapeutic potential extends to neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, multiple sclerosis, Lewy body dementia, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, where dopamine modulation plays a critical role. Furthermore, L-DOPA has demonstrated efficacy in neurological disorders including epilepsy, peripheral neuropathy, cerebrovascular diseases, and traumatic brain injury, suggesting broader neurobiological applications. However, long-term use is associated with challenges such as motor fluctuations, dyskinesias, and loss of therapeutic efficacy due to progressive neurodegeneration and alterations in dopaminergic pathways. Recent advancements in drug delivery systems, combination therapies, and nanotechnology, including plant-derived carbon dots, offer promising strategies to enhance L-DOPA's effectiveness while mitigating its limitations. This comprehensive review explores L-DOPA's synthesis, pharmacokinetics, mechanism of action, and its evolving role in neurological diseases, while highlighting ongoing challenges and future directions for optimizing its clinical application."

Our data suggest regional, temporal, and cell-type-specific regulatory pathways that establish distinct gene expression changes. Synaptic dysfunction is observed broadly throughout the brain, whereas we observed early dysregulation of the transcription factor 4 (Tcf4) that may drive cortical changes. Mitochondrial deficits are the earliest changes, beginning at P0 in the striatum. Striatal identity genes show early increased expression that becomes progressively downregulated. Finally, we identified a time-dependent dysregulation of neuropeptide Y signaling and potential interaction with the cyclic adenosine monophosphate/protein kinase A (cAMP/PKA) pathway, which may be involved in the imbalance between Drd1 and Drd2 neuron vulnerability."

    "abstract": "Neuroinflammation is caused by various factors, such as the activation of glial cells, the excessive release of chemokines and cytokines, and the accumulation of blood cells in the brain parenchyma. The inflammatory processes occur in acute and chronic phases, with traumatic brain injuries triggering the release of neurotoxins from CNS-specific glial cells. Furthermore, activation of microglia, astrocytes, and mast cells worsens the situation by producing pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and glia maturation factors. Chronic activation of astroglia and microglial cells promotes loss of neurons, memory, and impaired learning capacity, leading to neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. These implications have led to a rational search for inflammatory druggable targets. Based on various preclinical and clinical studies, NSAIDs (aspirin, ibuprofen, diclofenac, and mefenamic acid), SSRIs (fluoxetine and sertraline), antipsychotics (risperidone), corticosteroids (dexamethasone), antidiabetics (metformin and rosiglitazone), and statins (simvastatin and atorvastatin) have exhibited promising results. These drugs have anti-inflammatory and neuromodulation activities that enhance neuroplasticity and effectively manage neurodegenerative symptoms. In addition, non-pharmacological interventions such as art creation and physical exercise have been linked with improving neural development and stimulating the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines, which can attenuate disease progression and promote synaptic plasticity. Hence, it is imperative to understand the complex interplay between glial cells, inflammatory signalling and neural pathways. We reviewed the interconnected pathways between neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Moreover, recommendations for pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions to address these issues are discussed herein."

    "abstract": "Huntington's disease (HD) is a genetic neurodegenerative disorder caused by the abnormal expansion of the polyglutamine (polyQ) tract (> 35Q) in the first exon of the huntingtin (Htt), HttEx1. This N-terminal fragment tends to form fibrillar inclusions, which constitute a key pathological hallmark of HD. Although polyQ expansion is commonly understood to be a primary cause of HttEx1 pathology, the molecular mechanism of aggregations of non-pathogenic polyQ tract with the N-terminally flanking region of N17 in HttEx1 (HttEx1-17Q) remains largely unknown. In this study, we exclusively investigated the effect of the protein concentration on the structural transition of HttEx1-17Q and its relation to the amyloid fibril formation by employing biophysical techniques including nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence. Complementary analyses showed that monomeric HttEx1-17Q undergoes a multiple structural transition from largely unfolded structures to β structures via helical structures in a concentration-dependent manner in the early stages of aggregation. This structural rearrangement accelerates kinetically the formation of short amyloid fibrils of HttEx1-17Q by facilitating nucleation. Our findings provide new insights into the amyloid formation of HttEx1 by highlighting the critical role of a structural conversion into an amyloidogenic structure, of which mechanism is helpful to understand amyloidogenesis of other amyloid-forming molecules."

This review explores how IR promotes amyloidogenesis by disrupting cholesterol homeostasis and enhancing Amyloid beta (Aβ) production and aggregation. Specifically, we examine the role of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters in cholesterol homeostasis along with their impact on insulin signaling pathways, highlights how their dysregulation can lead to IR, a significant contributor to the development of amyloidogenesis, a key factor in causing NDDs. We explore the novel molecular mechanisms linking IR and Aβ aggregation, focusing on the interplay between ABC transporters and Amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing. Furthermore, we also explore emerging evidence linking ABC transporters to oxidative stress, inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction critical factors in the development of amyloidogenesis. Additionally, this review also discusses potential therapeutic strategies targeting ABC transporters to mitigate IR and reduce amyloid burden by various mechanisms including Insulin receptors/IRS-1 signaling, Phosphatidylinositol3kinase-Protein kinase-B (PI3K/AKT), Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), Glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3), mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR), Insulin-Degrading Enzyme (IDE), Advanced glycation end products (AGEs), Glucose transporters (GLUTs), Apolipoprotein E (ApoE), Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), Adiponectin, Mitochondrial dysfunctioning, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) Wingless-related integration site/beta-catenin (Wnt/β-catenin) and Sirtuin1 (SIRT1).

We analysed physician- and caregiver-reported real-world data from France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America collected July 2017-March 2021 via Adelphi Disease Specific Programmes™ in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), graft versus host disease (GvHD), Huntington's disease (HD), myasthenia gravis (MG), and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). Non-professional caregivers completed the EQ-5D-5L and Work Productivity and Activity Impairment questionnaire. Multivariate regression analysis modelled the relationship of care recipient/caregiver characteristics with caregiver HRQoL and productivity. Data were provided by 365 caregivers; 114, 89, 75, 32, 29 and 26 in GvHD, PSP, ALS, MG, EoE and HD, respectively. Care recipients' mean (standard deviation [SD]) age was 58.7 (15.6) years, 59% were male and 23% had both professional and non-professional caregivers. Patients' mean (SD) EuroQol visual analogue scale (EQ VAS) score was 50.9 (23.3) and mean EQ-5D utility was 0.460 (0.350). Caregivers' mean age was 55.8 (13.8) years, 66% were female. Caregivers' EQ-5D-5L indicated their greatest problems in anxiety/depression. Overall, 45% of caregivers were employed, mostly part-time. In the past 7 days, mean (SD) caregiver absenteeism was 5.2% (13.1%), presenteeism was 28.0% (23.7%), and activity impairment was 43.1% (27.2%). Regressions identified multiple significant associations with caregivers' HRQoL and productivity. Caregivers' HRQoL (EQ-5D utility and EQ VAS) was associated with care recipients' EQ-5D utility and caregivers' age. Outcomes relating to caregivers' employment and productivity (hours spent caring, employment status, hours in employment, hours of employment missed, absenteeism, presenteeism, work impairment and activity impairment) were most frequently associated with care recipients' EQ-5D utility, caregivers' age and sex, caregiver living with the care recipient, the presence of a professional caregiver, and the care recipient having HD. The substantial burden of providing non-professional caregiving to adults with rare diseases is associated with multiple factors. Interventions improving care recipient HRQoL could enhance caregiver HRQoL and productivity."

    "abstract": "The hung-up reflex (HUR) is a tonic reflex response characterized by delayed muscular relaxation following the elicitation of a tendon reflex. First described by Woltman in patients with myxedema and hypothyroidism, it is best demonstrated in the Achilles tendon. Currently, two primary techniques are used for its measurement: photomotography and the anemometer. The pathogenic mechanism underlying this phenomenon is closely linked to the physiological process of cellular membrane recovery, particularly the reabsorption of calcium by the sarcoplasmic reticulum. This sign has been documented in various pathologies, including Huntington's disease, stiff-person syndrome, stiff-limb syndrome, hypothyroidism, myxedema, and Sydenham's chorea. Over time, it has played a significant role in the clinical examination of movement disorders. The objective of this review is to analyze the historical description, pathophysiological mechanisms, and clinical significance of HUR, aiming to enhance the understanding of its presence in different pathological entities and facilitate differential diagnoses."

    "abstract": "Inflammasomes, particularly the NLRP3 inflammasome, play a pivotal role in mediating neuroinflammation in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), multiple sclerosis (MS), and Huntington's disease (HD). Recent findings indicate that the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in microglia and astrocytes triggers the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1β and IL-18, which contribute to chronic inflammation and neuronal damage. This process accelerates neurodegeneration and exacerbates disease progression. Misfolded protein aggregates, mitochondrial dysfunction, and oxidative stress are key factors in the pathological activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in these diseases. Recent studies have highlighted that targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome, either through direct inhibitors like MCC950 or natural compounds such as oridonin and β-hydroxybutyrate, shows promise in mitigating neuroinflammation and protecting neuronal integrity. These inhibitors have demonstrated neuroprotective effects in animal models of AD, PD, and MS, presenting a new therapeutic approach for halting disease progression. However, the complexity of NLRP3 regulation requires further investigation to balance its inflammatory and protective roles. This review examines the recent advancements in NLRP3 inflammasome research and discusses potential strategies for modulating inflammasome activity to slow or prevent the progression of neurodegenerative diseases."

    "abstract": "Neurons, as post-mitotic and long-lived cells, rely heavily on autophagy to maintain cellular homoeostasis and ensure proper function. Huntingtin (HTT), a protein central to Huntington's disease (HD), has emerged as a putative multifunctional regulator within the neuronal autophagy-lysosome pathway. This review explores normal HTT's multifaceted role in neuronal autophagy, from its potential involvement in autophagy induction, its capacity to influence cargo recognition and autophagosome formation, and its contribution to autophagosome-lysosome fusion and transport. We also discuss the unique challenges that neurons face in maintaining proteostasis through autophagy, emphasising the need for specialised mechanisms like axonal transport of autophagosomes and distinct regulatory pathways. Furthermore, we highlight the spatial and temporal regulation of neuronal autophagy, particularly in the context of ageing and neuronal maturation, underscoring the importance of understanding HTT's role in different neuronal states. By elucidating the intricate relationship between HTT and neuronal autophagy, this review aims to shed light on specific mechanisms of action in autophagy that can be disrupted in neurodegenerative diseases including HD."

    "abstract": "Protein aggregation, which is implicated in aging and neurodegenerative diseases, typically involves a transition from soluble monomers and oligomers to insoluble fibrils. Polyglutamine (polyQ) tracts in proteins can form amyloid fibrils, which are linked to polyQ diseases, including Huntington's disease (HD), where the length of the polyQ tract inversely correlates with the age of onset. Despite significant research on the mechanisms of Httex1 aggregation, atomistic information regarding the intermediate stages of its fibrillation and the morphological characteristics of the end-state amyloid fibrils remains limited. Recently, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations based on a hybrid multistate structure-based model, Multi-eGO, have shown promise in capturing the kinetics and mechanism of amyloid fibrillation with high computational efficiency while achieving qualitative agreement with experiments. Here, we utilize the multi-eGO simulation methodology to study the mechanism and kinetics of polyQ fibrillation and the effect of the N17 flanking domain of Huntingtin protein. Aggregation simulations of polyQ produced highly heterogeneous amyloid fibrils with variable-width branched morphologies by incorporating combinations of β-turn, β-arc, and β-strand structures, while the presence of the N17 flanking domain reduces amyloid fibril heterogeneity by favoring β-strand conformations. Our simulations reveal that the presence of N17 domain enhanced aggregation kinetics by promoting the formation of large, structurally stable oligomers. Furthermore, the early-stage aggregation process involves two distinct mechanisms: backbone interactions driving β-sheet formation and side-chain interdigitation. Overall, our study provides detailed insights into fibrillation kinetics, mechanisms, and end-state polymorphism associated with Httex1 amyloid aggregation. Polyglutamine (polyQ) aggregation is central to Huntington's disease and related neurodegenerative disorders. Despite extensive experimental efforts, a complete molecular understanding of this process-from early aggregation events to the origins of fibril polymorphism-has remained elusive, with varied interpretations of complex fibril architectures. Through multiscale simulations, we reveal how polyQ fibrils adopt diverse tertiary and quaternary structures and demonstrate how the N-terminal flanking domain (N17) modulates fibril architecture and accelerates aggregation. Our hybrid multi-eGO simulations capture early-stage fibrillation kinetics and identify distinct structural polymorphs that align with experimental observations. This work provides a molecular framework for understanding amyloid polymorphism and illuminates the role of flanking domains in shaping aggregation pathways-offering valuable insights for therapeutic strategies targeting early toxic intermediates."

Clinical features are UV-light hypersensitivity with erythema, corneal lesions, and increased risk for skin cancers. Around 20% of affected individuals develop neurological manifestations like movement disorders due to neurodegeneration. We report a 33-year-old man, presenting with mild choreatic movements of the lower face and limbs, executive dysfunction and mild atactic features. Dermatological changes were seen on sun-exposed skin. Brain MRI revealed global atrophy. Whole exome sequencing and familial segregation analysis revealed two compound heterozygous mutations in the <i>ERCC4</i> gene, confirming XP-F diagnosis. An extensive literature review identified sixteen studies reporting patients with confirmed XP as well as chorea as extrapyramidal movement disorder in their clinical phenotype. The clinical phenotyping of these patients was carefully evaluated, listed and analysed. In addition, available genetic data was systematically collected and reviewed. We describe an XP-patient with a Huntingtońs disease (HD)-like syndrome with discrete cerebellar ataxia. Through reviewing the literature, we identified a total of 41 XP-patients with chorea. Therefore, we suggest testing of NER genes in patients with a HD-like syndrome and negative genetic testing for HD, especially when dermatological changes and atactic features are present."

    "abstract": "Uterine serous carcinoma (USC) accounts for 40% of endometrial cancer-related deaths. The standard of care for stages III and IV USC yields a 20%-30% survival at 2 years and a 10%-20% survival at 3-5 years. Recent advances in the second-line treatment of advanced or recurrent USC are rapidly evolving. Targeted therapeutic approaches with the use of lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab, as well as the use of trastuzumab deruxtecan, offer new hope for successful second-line therapies for patients. However, further investigation into novel targeted therapeutic approaches is warranted, given the high burden of disease associated with this aggressive histological subtype. USC shares clinical and genomic similarities with epithelial ovarian cancer, suggesting a correlation with 'BRCAness'. Niraparib, a potent PARP1 and PARP2 inhibitor, was shown to have a positive impact on platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer, regardless of the presence or absence of BRCA status. Our hypothesis is that patients with stage III, stage IV and platinum-sensitive recurrent USC receiving niraparib maintenance in addition to standard therapy for USC may have an improved progression-free survival. Participating sites include the primary site, Northwell Health Zucker Cancer Centre, and secondary site, Rutgers Cancer Institute of NJ. Females over the age of 18 with stage III, stage IV or platinum-sensitive recurrent USC will be recruited and enrolled based on inclusion/exclusion criteria. 24 subjects will be enrolled during phase 1 and 21 subjects will be enrolled during phase 2, over a total of 3 years. Patients will receive an individualised dose of niraparib daily every 28 days per cycle for 1 year or until progression of disease. Follow-up of disease status will continue for 5 years poststudy treatment. This phase II clinical trial will employ a Simon two-stage minimax design to test the null hypothesis that the 1 year response rate is <20% versus the alternative hypothesis that the 1 year response rate is ≥40%, with alpha=0.05 and power=0.90. Ethical approval was granted by Northwell Health Cancer Institute institutional review board (reference number: 19-0380) and PRMS.

    "abstract": "Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is the most reliable noninvasive predictor of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). Individuals with no detectable or minimal CAC (Agatston score 1-100) are considered at the lowest risk. However, MACE do occur in these groups. This study evaluated whether quantification of cardiac vagal activity by heart rate fragmentation (HRF) improved MACE risk prediction beyond CAC imaging. Our study population is a cohort of the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA). Cox regression models were used to assess the association between HRF, derived from polysomnographic ECGs, and incident MACE in the overall cohort with concurrent polysomnographic ECG and CAC data, and three non-overlapping subgroups: \"very-low-risk\" (CAC = 0), \"low-risk\" (0 < CAC < 100), and \"higher-risk\" (CAC ≥ 100). Over a median (1<sup>st</sup>; 3<sup>rd</sup> quartiles) follow-up period of 8.9 (8.4; 9.4) years, there were 164, 29, 47 and 88 incident MACE in the overall cohort (n=1,354), very-low-risk (n=495), low-risk (n=422) and higher-risk (n=437) subgroups, respectively. A one-standard deviation increment in HRF was associated with a 22% (3% - 44%) and a 60% (16% - 122%) increase in the rate of MACE in the overall cohort and those without detectable CAC, respectively. Neither the Framingham nor MESA-CAC index was predictive of MACE in the lowest-risk subgroup until nearly a decade of follow-up. From a physiologic perspective, our results suggest that vagal dysfunction precedes the onset of overt cardiovascular disease (CVD). From a translational perspective, they indicate that HRF enhances risk stratification, especially in populations traditionally classified as very-low risk."

While Alzheimer's disease, Multiple Sclerosis, and Parkinson's disease have garnered considerable attention due to their incidence and socioeconomic significance, many additional neurological illnesses remain unclear in terms of underlying pathophysiology and prospective treatment targets. This review synthesizes evidence linking LPA's function in neurological diseases such as traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, cerebellar ataxia, cerebral ischemia, seizures, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome, autism, migraine, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated complications Despite recent advances, the specific mechanisms underlying LPA's actions in various neurological disorders remain unknown, and further research is needed to understand the distinct roles of LPA across multiple disease conditions, as well as to investigate the therapeutic potential of targeting LPA receptors in these pathologies. The purpose of this review is to highlight the multiple functions of LPA in the aforementioned neurological diseases, which frequently share the same poor prognosis due to a scarcity of truly effective therapies, while also evaluating the role of LPA, its receptors, and signaling as promising actors for the development of alternative therapeutic strategies to those proposed today."

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by progressive neuronal loss and dysfunction, with protein kinases playing crucial roles in their pathogenesis. This article explores the involvement of protein kinases in these disorders, focusing on their contributions to disease mechanisms, potential as therapeutic targets and challenges in developing effective treatments. In Alzheimer's disease, kinases such as CDK5, GSK3β and MARK4 are implicated in tau hyperphosphorylation and the formation of neurofibrillary tangles. Kinases also regulate amyloid-β processing and plaque formation. In Parkinson's disease, LRRK2, PINK1 and other kinases contribute to α-synuclein pathology, mitochondrial dysfunction and neuroinflammation. LRRK2 inhibitors and PROTACs have shown promise in preclinical models. Huntington's disease involves altered kinase activity, with CK2, GSK3 and MAPK pathways influencing mutant huntingtin toxicity and aggregation. Kinases are also implicated in less common neurodegenerative diseases, such as ALS and spinocerebellar ataxias. Despite the therapeutic potential of targeting kinases, challenges remain, including the complexity of kinase networks, blood-brain barrier permeability and the lack of robust biomarkers. Emerging technologies, such as covalent inhibitors, targeted protein degradation and combination therapies, offer new avenues for addressing these challenges and developing more effective treatments for neurodegenerative diseases."

This has generated significant research interest in the field. The proper functioning of mitochondria relies on the dynamic regulation of the mitochondrial quality control system. Key processes such as mitochondrial biogenesis, mitophagy, and mitochondrial dynamics (division/fusion) are essential for maintaining this balance. These processes collectively govern mitochondrial function and homeostasis. Therefore, the mitochondrial quality control system plays a critical role in the onset and progression of neurodegenerative diseases. This article provides a concise overview of the molecular mechanisms involved in mitochondrial biogenesis, mitophagy, and mitochondrial dynamics, explores their interactions, and summarizes current research progress in understanding the mitochondrial quality control system in the context of neurodegenerative diseases."

    "abstract": "DNA triplet repeat expansion is the mutational cause of neurodegenerative disorders such as Huntington's disease, myotonic dystrophy type 1, and fragile-X related disorders. There is a general consensus that recognition of extrahelical extrusions or hairpin-loop structures (formed by strand slippage) by the DNA mismatch repair protein MutSβ leads to repeat expansion by a mutagenic repair process. By contrast, the FAN1 nuclease prevents triplet repeat expansion, the molecular basis of which was explained by our recent finding that FAN1 nuclease cleaves and initiates removal of extrahelical extrusions. We have proposed that competition for extrusion binding between FAN1 and MutSβ governs the outcome of the opposing effects of these two pathways. Here we show that extrusions containing 2-3 triplet repeats are recognized and processed by both FAN1 and MutSβ pathways. However, a single triplet extrusion escapes FAN1 cleavage and is exclusively processed by MutSβ-dependent MMR, leading to repeat expansion. Thus, the size of the extrahelical extrusions formed by strand slippage events affects the ultimate fate of the repeat elements, and controls the bias between repeat expansion or stability. These findings provide new insights into the role of DNA structural dynamics in establishing pathway choice in DNA repair."

    "abstract": "Huntington's disease (HD) is a progressive, autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the selective dysfunction and loss of neurons in the striatum and cerebral cortex. Experimental evidence suggests that GABAergic medium-sized spiny neurons (MSNs) in the striatum are particularly vulnerable to glutamate-induced toxicity (excitotoxicity) and its analogues. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying MSN-specific death in HD remain poorly understood. The serine/threonine protein kinase D1 (PKD1) confers neuroprotection in various neuropathological conditions, including ischemic stroke. While excitotoxicity inactivates PKD1 in cortical glutamatergic neurons without altering its levels, active PKD1 potentiates the survival of excitatory neurons in highly excitotoxic environments. Here, we investigated whether PKD1 activity dysregulation contributes to MSN death in HD and its association with neurodegeneration. We found an unexpected reduction in PKD1 protein levels in striatal neurons from HD patients. Similarly, the R6/1 mouse model of HD exhibited progressive PKD1 protein loss, commencing at early disease stages, accompanied by decreased Prkd1 transcript levels. PKD1 downregulation also occurred in the cerebral cortex of R6/1 mice, but only at late stages. Functionally, pharmacological PKD inhibition in primary striatal neurons exacerbated excitotoxic damage and apoptosis induced by glutamate N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, whereas expression of constitutively active PKD1 (PKD1-Ca) conferred neuroprotection. Furthermore, PKD1-Ca protected against polyQ-induced apoptosis in a cellular model of HD. In a translational approach, intrastriatal lentiviral delivery of PKD1-Ca in symptomatic R6/1 mice prevented the loss of DARPP-32, a molecular marker of MSNs. Collectively, our findings strongly suggest that PKD1 loss-of-function contributes to HD pathogenesis and the selective vulnerability of MSNs. These findings position PKD1 as a promising therapeutic target for mitigating MSN death in HD."

This study presents the first case of Huntington disease-like 1 (HDL-1) in a Chinese family and summarises the clinical features of previously reported HDL-1 cases and patients with octapeptide repeat insertion (OPRI) mutations. The proband, a 36-year-old woman, presented with progressive involuntary movements, bradykinesia, cognitive decline and personality changes over 6 years, worsening over the past year. Similar manifestations were noted in her grandmother, father and aunt. Genetic testing revealed an 8-OPRI mutation in <i>PRNP</i>, confirming HDL-1. Neuroimaging showed increased T2-Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) signals in the hippocampi and atrophic changes in the frontal and parietal lobes. Electroencephalography indicated a slowed background rhythm. A 1-year follow-up visit showed amelioration of choreic movements. A literature review identified five families with HDL-1, with age of onset ranging from 18 years to 54 years and disease duration from 3 months to over 20 years. Common manifestations included movement disorders, dementia, personality changes and heterogeneous symptoms such as epilepsy. Imaging showed ventricular enlargement and diffuse brain atrophy, primarily affecting the basal ganglia, frontal lobes, temporal lobes and cerebellum. Pathologically, prion protein antibody staining was positive, although spongiform changes were not prominent. These cases highlight the importance of considering familial prion diseases in patients with hereditary chorea and a negative HD gene test. Careful attention to treatment and follow-up can provide valuable insights for managing these patients."

A principal component analysis was performed on pooled data (n = 109) to identify components and factor loadings of subscales. Linear mixed models were used to examine differences in components between groups and timepoints. Three meaningful components emerged. Component 1 comprised positive loading for dimensions of apathy and impulsive behaviour pertaining to goal-directedness, namely attention, planning, initiation, and perseverance. In contrast, other dimensions of apathy and impulsive behaviour loaded onto components two and three in opposite directions. People with HD only scored worse than controls on the goal-directedness component. All components remained stable over time and closely resembled factors from the five-factor personality model. Component 1 mapped onto the factor conscientiousness, component 2 to extraversion, and component 3 to neuroticism. The clinical overlap between apathy and impulsive behaviour in HD relates to goal-directedness, whilst other dimensions of these constructs did not overlap."

    "abstract": "While Huntington's disease (HD), a Mendelian disorder caused by an expanded CAG repeat in <i>HTT</i>, is considered rare, the true prevalence could be significantly higher due to substantial underascertainment. Given inherent biases in empirically assessing disease prevalence, we performed mathematical modelling and validation analyses to estimate the frequency of expanded CAG repeats in the general population to better understand the disease prevalence. We developed an exponential decay model after confirming that the logarithmic decrease in frequency of CAG repeats extends into the pathogenic range (CAG > 35). The model was further refined by incorporating HD onset and mortality probabilities to estimate the clinical ascertainment rate. Our age-adjusted exponential decay model estimated one expanded repeat in 325 people and further showed that the frequency of expanded repeats decreases with age due to the early mortality associated with HD, which was validated by All of Us and UK Biobank data. Importantly, our data suggest that approximately half of symptomatic HD individuals aged 30-70 are not clinically ascertained/diagnosed. Our data, showing higher frequencies of expanded repeats in the general population and significant underascertainment rates, imply that HD prevalence could be twice as high as current estimates."

    "abstract": "Circular RNAs are a large class of non-coding RNA molecules, conserved across species and produced by back-splicing. While their molecular functions are still elusive, the ones primarily retained in the nucleus are usually associated to regulation of transcription and mRNA processing patterns. Instead, the majority, are transported to the cytoplasm where they elicit micro-RNA (miRNA) or RNA binding protein (RBP)-sponging functions, or could be translated. CircRNAs are abundantly expressed in brain tissue, where they do not only act as regulators of brain development and physiology, but can also contribute to complex neurological conditions. In fact, deregulated circRNA expression levels were described in neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders, like Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease. Because of their described roles in pathology, these molecules may not only represent possible disease bio-markers, but they could even function as disease modifiers. As such, they could be targeted or protected in search of novel routes of therapeutic intervention. In this review, we highlight recent developments in the field, first discussing circRNAs involved in physiologic brain development and function, then reviewing studies that implicate circRNAs in neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders, with major attention to experimental studies exploring circRNA function and their role in neuropathologic processes. Such experimental strategies are mainly based on depletion or over-expression approaches and provide important insights into the modulatory potential of these molecules.

Mann-Whitney U Tests were used to compare groups on all measures. A multiple regression model was developed within the HD Family group to investigate which aspects of childhood trauma best predicted psychological distress in adulthood.ResultsCompared to controls, people raised in an HD family reported significantly more total childhood trauma as well emotional abuse, physical abuse, and emotional and physical neglect. Global psychological distress in adulthood, depression, and psychoticism were also observed to be significantly higher in the HD Family Group. The regression model identified childhood emotional abuse as the only significant predictor of global psychological distress in adulthood.ConclusionsGrowing up in an HD family may be significantly associated with higher levels of self-reported childhood trauma as well as psychological distress in adulthood, with emotional abuse playing a more significant role in shaping long-term mental health outcomes."

The purpose of this review is to provide clinicians with a comprehensive summary of the latest information on the diagnosis and management of EF. The pathogenesis of EF is unclear; however, it is believed to involve increased fibroblast activity and interleukins linked to eosinophilia, such as interleukin (IL)-5. While mostly idiopathic, triggers include exercise, trauma, infection, and specific medications. The disease is typically characterized by erythema, edema, and induration of extremities, with laboratory findings including peripheral eosinophilia and hypergammaglobulinemia. EF is typically mistaken for other sclerosing diseases, such as systemic sclerosis and morphea. Diagnostic workup for EF may include an initial complete blood count (CBC) with differential, followed by erythrocyte sedimentation rate and aldolase to classify severity, and a systemic hematologic workup if indicated. A full-thickness skin-to-muscle (including fascia) incisional biopsy is the diagnostic gold standard though magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be highly sufficient. Ultrasound presents as an accessible tool for determining the biopsy site and supporting a diagnosis of EF. While commonly treated with corticosteroids and methotrexate, studies have revealed that many patients are refractory to these traditional therapies. Biologic therapies have shown utility in treatment-resistant EF, often resulting in at least partial resolution of their disease. The long-term prognosis for EF is reliant on treatment and its timelines. Complications, such as decreased range of motion, can significantly impact patients' quality of life. Further research should focus on understanding EF pathogenesis, diagnostic strategies for early detection, and assessing newer therapies in prospective clinical trials."

Although no disease-modifying therapies are available, lowering levels of the causative mutant polyQ protein is a promising potential treatment. Preclinically, the efficacy of polyQ protein-lowering compounds is often assessed using time-consuming Western blots (WB), which can produce variable results. Therefore, to improve throughput and accuracy of polyQ protein level quantification, Simple Western (SW) capillary immunoassays were developed. A panel of antibodies was screened for reactivity to the polyQ proteins on SW. The most promising antibodies were selected for further assay development. This resulted in optimised SW immunoassays for huntingtin (HTT), ataxin 1, 2 and 3 (ATXN1, 2, 3), atrophin 1 (ATN1) and androgen receptor (AR). Additionally, size-separation of the wild-type and polyQ-expanded mutant protein isoforms on SW was shown for ATXN1, ATXN3 and ATN1, allowing for their separate quantification. To facilitate size-separation of the larger HTT protein (≥ 348 kDa), a novel caspase 3-based assay was developed to generate N-terminal wild-type and mutant HTT fragments that could be separately quantified on SW in contrast to full-length HTT. In conclusion, SW capillary immunoassays were developed for polyQ proteins to improve preclinical research and aid the development of polyQ-lowering therapies for polyQ diseases."

    "title": "Large scale gene set ranking for survival-related gene sets.",
    "abstract": "Disease progression is closely linked to shifts in the expression levels of specific genes within molecular pathways. While gene set enrichment analysis is a widely employed method for identifying key disease markers, it has been underutilized in survival analysis. Here, we introduce a novel computational approach that adapts gene set enrichment analysis for survival analysis. The proposed approach considers a gene set, computes a single-sample gene set enrichment score, and, based on this score, splits the samples into cohorts. It then scores the gene sets by evaluating the differences in survival rates between the resulting cohorts. We aim to find gene sets that can lead to cohorts with significantly different survival probabilities. Utilizing gene expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas and gene sets from the Molecular Signature Database, our results demonstrate that existing empirical research consistently supports the top gene sets our approach associates with survival prognosis. The proposed method broadens gene set enrichment analysis applications to include information on survival, bridging the gap between alterations in molecular pathways and their implications on survival."

    "title": "Association between the Planetary Health Diet Index and growth differentiation factor-15: the Seniors ENRICA-2 cohort.",
    "abstract": "The growth differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15) is an inflammaging biomarker, predictor of cardiovascular disease (CVD), and several other non-communicable diseases (NCD) that represent the main causes of death globally, for which prevention is essential. Current worldwide threats include NCD and environmental burden, where diet is a key determinant. Therefore, the EAT-Lancet Commission developed the Planetary Health Diet Index (PHDI), a dietary pattern designed to ameliorate human and environmental health. The objective of the study was to evaluate the association between the PHDI and serum concentrations of GDF-15 in older adults. Study participants were 2497 people aged + 65 years from the Seniors-ENRICA-2 study. Food consumption was obtained through a validated diet history, and adherence to the PHDI was estimated with a score of 15 food groups (range 0-140), where higher scores indicated better adherence. Analyses for the association between the PHDI and GDF-15 concentrations were performed using multivariable linear regression models, adjusting for main potential confounders. The PHDI showed an inverse dose-response association with GDF-15 concentrations. Compared with participants in the lowest quartile of the PHDI, those in the highest quartile had a mean percentage difference (95% CI) of - 6.8% (- 11.1, - 2.4) in GDF-15 concentrations. The mean percentage difference (95% CI) per 20-point increase of adherence was - 4.4% (- 7.7, - 0.9). Consumption of whole grains, fruits, nuts, and a low intake of trans and saturated fat were important drivers of this association. Results remained robust after adjustment for other inflammation (interleukin 6), renal and cardiac (creatinine, NT-proBNP, cardiac troponin T) biomarkers, and after excluding participants with CVD, type 2 diabetes, and obesity. The PHDI was associated with lower concentrations of GDF-15. Adopting the PHDI may be a useful approach to reduce chronic inflammation and target NCD prevention in the older adult population, while staying within planetary boundaries."

    "title": "The Imitation Game: Melanoma Metastasis Poses as a Primary Breast Tumor.",
    "abstract": "Metastatic melanoma to the breast is a rare phenomenon often mistaken for primary breast cancer due to overlapping clinical and imaging characteristics. We report the case of a 51-year-old woman with a history of melanoma resected 7 years earlier, presenting with severe left hip pain and a 6-month history of a right breast lump. Imaging revealed extensive metastatic disease, including lesions in the femoral head, breast, lung, adrenal gland, and thoracic spine. Pathologic examination of the hip lesion obtained during total arthroplasty, as well as biopsies of the breast and lung, confirmed metastatic melanoma. Histology revealed pleomorphic tumor cells with necrosis, while immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated SOX10 and S100 positivity, confirming the diagnosis. Genetic testing identified microsatellite stability with a tumor mutational burden of 16 mutations per mega base. This case shows the importance of thorough cancer histories and the use of immunohistochemical staining to distinguish metastatic melanoma from primary breast malignancies. Despite timely diagnosis and intervention, the patient's condition deteriorated rapidly, reflecting the aggressive nature of metastatic melanoma. This case highlights the need for vigilance in patients with a history of melanoma presenting with new breast masses to ensure accurate diagnosis and appropriate management."

    "abstract": "Loss of Y chromosome (LOY), an age-related somatic mutation, is associated with various age-related diseases, but its role in the onset and progression of Parkinson's disease (PD) remains unclear. This study investigated the relationship between blood LOY levels and the risk of PD onset and progression. We estimated the LOY level for each male participant based on genome-wide arrays or whole genome sequencing data. We performed Cox proportional hazards regression analysis among 222,598 male participants in the UK Biobank and linear mixed model analysis involving 2574 male individuals with PD across 14 cohorts, encompassing 19,562 visits. In the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) cohort, we further compared brain structure using T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, and carried out brain network functional connectivity analysis based on resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) datasets. Additionally, we assessed the LOY status in single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) data, which included 1,303,531 cells from 279 post-mortem samples across five brain regions, and performed temporal dynamic gene expression analysis. Male participants with LOY had a slightly higher risk of developing PD during follow-up (HR = 1·16, 95% CI = 1·01-1·34, P = 0·04). Among males affected by PD, LOY carriers experienced accelerated neurodegenerative progression, manifesting as more rapid motor impairment (P = 0·0072) and cognitive decline (P = 0·0005) compared to non-LOY carriers. Patients with PD carrying LOY also exhibited decreased network functional connectivity in certain brain regions. Notably, LOY cells were particularly enriched in microglia/immune and vascular/epithelial cells, and a subset of genes in LOY-Mic P2RY12 cells were associated with PD progression. This data-driven study highlights the potential association of LOY with the onset and progression of PD through the analysis of multi-scale data, including clinical phenotypes, brain neuroimaging maps, and molecular profiles from single-nucleus transcriptome across multi-brain regions. These findings suggest that LOY may be an accomplice to the onset and progression of PD.

    "title": "Research Progress of G Protein-coupled Receptor 52 on Central Nervous System Diseases.",
    "abstract": "The G protein-coupled receptor 52 (GPR52) is a Gs-coupled receptor and is located principally in the striatum alongside D<sub>2</sub> receptor and in the pre-frontal cortex alongside D<sub>1</sub> receptor. Its stimulation leads to potentiation of intracellular cAMP levels, producing effects on cAMP levels similar to those of a Gi-coupled D<sub>2</sub> receptor antagonist in the striatum and a Gscoupled D<sub>1</sub> receptor agonist in the prefrontal cortex. This dual mechanism suggests that GPR52 activation could result in antipsychotic effects akin to D<sub>2</sub> antagonism and pro-cognitive effects resembling D<sub>1</sub> agonism. As a result, GPR52 has emerged as a promising therapeutic target for central nervous system (CNS) disorders, including schizophrenia and substance use disorder. Additionally, knocking out (KO) GPR52 not only significantly reduces mutant huntingtin protein (mHTT) levels in the striatum but also rescues Huntington's disease-associated behavioral phenotypes in a knock-in Huntington's disease mouse model, which provides evidence that GRP52 may also serve as a potential target for Huntington's disease. This review summarizes the current state of small-molecule ligand/drug discovery for GPR52, focusing on the latest findings about the role of GPR52 in schizophrenia and Huntington's disease."

    "abstract": "Thermoregulation is critical for preventing hyperthermia during physical activity. In Huntington's disease (HD), research on possible thermoregulatory alterations has received little attention. We aimed to investigate and compare skin temperature differences before and after exercise between HD patients and healthy controls. Additionally, we aimed to evaluate potential correlations between thermoregulation, body composition, and HD severity. This was a cross-sectional study. HD severity was assessed using the Total Functional Capacity and Unified HD rating scales. Skin temperature was assessed using thermographic infrared imaging of standardized 13 anatomical locations on the trunk and upper and lower extremities at baseline and after a treadmill test. Resting oxygen consumption was measured by indirect calorimetry. Differences between groups and correlation analyses between alterations in skin temperature and body composition, and HD severity were performed. We included 14 patients with mild-moderate HD, mean age 60.5 (32-68) years, and 10 healthy-matched controls, mean age 56 (29-65) years. Although, similar thermoregulation capacity was observed between HD patients and controls, uniquely in HD, reduced temperature recovery after exercise was inversely correlated with body mass index (particularly fat mass), resting oxygen consumption, and CAG repeats, and positively correlated with age and quality of life (mental health domain). Although thermoregulation appears to remain largely intact in patients with mild to moderate HD, it tends to decline with aging, CAG repeat expansion, and lower BMI, which may negatively impact overall well-being in HD patients. However, further research with larger sample sizes is essential to confirm these results."

    "abstract": "Recently, oligonucleotide post-transcriptional gene silencing, antisense oligonucleotides, small interfering RNA, ribozymes, and Deoxyribozymes (DNAzymes) have been used to tackle neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and polyglutamine diseases like Huntington's disease. However, the primary obstacle to the therapeutic effectiveness of these oligonucleotides is the blood-brain barrier (BBB), a crucial protective mechanism limiting drug penetration into brain cells. In this study, we generated a DNAzyme-loaded nanoliposome (DNZ-NLP) as a drug delivery system to effectively deliver and release the DNAzymes to the brain. The investigation of physicochemical characteristics of fabricated nanoliposomes, particularly size, morphology, and surface charge, revealed that the size of DNZ-NLPs was ~ 68 nm, an optimum size for brain delivery. Cellular uptake and cytocompatibility studies using SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells demonstrated that both blank nanoliposomes (B-NLPs) and DNZ-NLPs were cytocompatible, and DNZ-NLPs had a stable biphasic release profile in 48 h. Most importantly, about 60% of intravenously administered DNZ-NLPs to the healthy mouse were found in the brains of the animals. These findings confirmed that DNZ-NLPs passed the BBB. The controlled release of DNAzymes, the maximal cytocompatibility, and significantly improved BBB permeability suggest that our DNZ-NLPs offer a promising formulation for delivering all types of oligonucleotides to the brain for neurodegenerative disease treatments."

    "abstract": "Peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) are synthetic nucleic acid analogues offering distinct structural and functional advantages over conventional RNA and DNA, positioning them as powerful molecules in molecular biology. Recently, PNAs have gained significant attention for their potential in the prevention and management of neurological diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple sclerosis (MS), Huntington's disease (HD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), stroke, traumatic brain injury (TBI), spinal cord injury (SCI), depression, and anxiety. PNA5, a specific PNA variant, is highly expressed in neocortical association regions, particularly in primates, and plays a critical role in high-level cognitive functions such as reasoning, decision-making, and problem-solving. It can form stable, sequence-specific hybridizations with nucleic acids, resist nuclease degradation, and efficiently cross cellular membranes, making them ideal candidates for targeting disease-related genes in the brain. PNA5 has shown neuroprotective properties by improving cognitive function, reducing neuroinflammation, and preserving the integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Additionally, it supports critical processes such as neural migration, axon guidance, and synaptogenesis, which are vital for maintaining proper brain function. This review explores the mechanisms by which PNAs, particularly PNA5, exert therapeutic effects in neurological disorders. It highlights their role in gene modulation, protein regulation, and potential strategies for enhancing PNA delivery to the central nervous system (CNS) and its related disorders."

    "title": "Executive Summary of the Clinical Practice Guideline on the Surgical Management of Chronic Rhinosinusitis.",
    "abstract": "The purpose of this specialty-specific clinical practice guideline is to identify quality improvement opportunities and provide clinicians with trustworthy, evidence-based recommendations for the surgical management of chronic rhinosinusitis in adults. The target audience includes otolaryngologist-head and neck surgeons who manage adults with chronic rhinosinusitis, including candidacy and performance of endoscopic sinus surgery. This executive summary describes the guideline developed using the 55-page protocol published as the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation's Clinical Practice Guideline Development Manual (3rd edition), which summarizes the methodology for assessments of current data, topic prioritization, development of key action statements (KASs), application of value judgments, and related procedures. The guideline group represented otolaryngologists, rhinologists, advanced practice nursing and physician assistants, and consumers who represented participating national professional organizations. The Guideline Development Group made strong recommendations for the following KASs: Before considering surgery, the surgeon should verify an existing diagnosis of chronic rhinosinusitis to ensure established diagnostic criteria (signs and symptoms) from clinical practice guidelines are met, and the surgeon should assess candidacy for sinus surgery based on symptoms, disease characteristics, quality of life, and prior medical or surgical therapy (KASs 1A and 1B). The surgeon or their designee should not prescribe antibacterial therapy to an adult with chronic rhinosinusitis if significant or persistent purulent nasal discharge (anterior, posterior, or both) is absent on examination (KAS 3). The Guideline Development Group made recommendations for the following KASs: The surgeon should not endorse or require a predefined, one-size-fits-all regimen or duration of medical therapy (eg, antibiotics, steroids, antihistamines) as a prerequisite to sinus surgery for an adult with chronic rhinosinusitis (KAS 2). The surgeon should identify patients with chronic rhinosinusitis that would benefit most from surgery and are least likely to benefit from continued medical therapy alone, such as those with chronic rhinosinusitis subtypes that include, but are not limited to, chronic rhinosinusitis with polyps, polyps with bony erosion, eosinophilic mucin, or fungal balls (KAS 4). The surgeon or their designee should counsel patients before sinus surgery to establish realistic expectations, including the potential for chronicity or relapse, and the likelihood of long-term medical management, taking into account their chronic rhinosinusitis subtype (KAS 5). The surgeon should offer sinus surgery to an adult with chronic rhinosinusitis when the anticipated benefits exceed that of nonsurgical management alone, there is clarity regarding the anticipated outcomes, and the patient understands the expectation for long-term disease management following surgery (KAS 6). For an adult who is a candidate for sinus surgery, the surgeon or their designee should obtain a computed tomography (CT) scan with a fine-cut protocol, if not already available, to examine the paranasal sinuses for surgical planning (KAS 7). The surgeon should not plan the extent of sinus surgery (eg, which specific sinuses to operate on) solely based on arbitrary criteria regarding a minimal level of mucosal thickening, sinus opacification, or outflow obstruction on a CT scan (KAS 8). The surgeon or their designee should educate an adult with chronic rhinosinusitis who is scheduled for sinus surgery regarding anticipated postoperative care, specifically pain control, debridement, medical management, activity restrictions, return to work, duration and frequency of follow-up visits, and the potential for recurrent disease or revision surgery (KAS 9). When the sinus involves polyps, osteitis, bony erosion, or fungal disease in an adult with chronic rhinosinusitis who is scheduled for sinus surgery, the surgeon should perform sinus surgery that includes full exposure of the sinus cavity (lumen) and removal of diseased tissue, not just balloon or manual ostial dilation, or refer the patient to a surgeon who can perform this extent of surgery (KAS 10). The surgeon or their designee should routinely follow up to assess and document outcomes of sinus surgery for chronic rhinosinusitis, between 3 and 12 months after the procedure, through history (symptom relief, quality of life, complications, adherence to therapy, need for rescue medications, and ongoing care) and nasal endoscopy (KAS 11). There were no recommendations that were considered options from the Guideline Development Group."

Twenty-three cognitively healthy (CH) participants, including those with pathological (CH-PAT) and normal (CH-NAT) Aβ42/tau ratios, underwent lumbar puncture for CSF Aβ42/tau and ptau-181 quantification using electrochemiluminescence assays. OCTA en face images of the choriocapillaris were analyzed for flow deficits within a 6 × 6 mm macular grid and 3- and 6-mm Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) perifoveal rings. The association between CC FD% and CSF Aβ42/tau and CSF ptau-181 levels was evaluated. Perifoveal microvascular changes in the choriocapillaris outer ring (6-mm ETDRS ring) were significantly correlated with the CSF Aβ42/tau ratio in CH-PATs compared to CH-NATs. However, linear regression analysis across all CH participants (CH-PAT + CH-NAT) revealed that only age was significantly associated with CSF ptau-181 levels. Our findings suggest that this cohort is in an early preclinical AD stage, without ptau-181 biomarker evidence of established AD. SS-OCTA measures may complement CSF A/T (amyloid/tau) levels, helping to define transitional stages from CH-NAT to CH-PAT during presymptomatic AD. By identifying the transition from normal aging to presymptomatic AD, SS-OCTA metrics combined with biofluid markers could enhance AD oculomics by stratifying disease risk and prioritizing treatment interventions."

The striatum and hippocampus are affected in HD, functionally interacting allowing intact object-location memory. The present study investigated if object location memory impairment in premanifest and manifest HD was associated with aberrations in effective connectivity between striatum and hippocampal formation. Using dynamic causal modelling, we examined effective connectivity between the striatum and hippocampus and association with object-location memory in 35 HD participants (23 premanifest, 12 early manifest) and 32 controls. HD participants' object-location memory was worse than controls, with performance associated with aberrant effective connectivity from the striatum to hippocampal formation, lower connectivity was associated with poorer object-location memory. Connectivity from hippocampal formation to the striatum was lower in manifest HD. In premanifest HD, connectivity from parahippocampal gyrus to the striatum was stronger and associated with better object-location memory. Findings raise questions regarding compensatory neural processes in HD and other neurodegenerative diseases, providing pathophysiological evidence that cognitive impairment may be related to connectopathy. © 2025 The Author(s).

Gallbladder involvement is exceedingly rare and poses significant diagnostic challenges. Few cases in the literature describe gallbladder follicular lymphoma, particularly in elderly male patients, leaving notable gaps in clinical understanding and management. Herein, we present the case of an 82-year-old male who presented with acute abdominal pain and unintentional weight loss. Initial imaging, including contrast-enhanced computed tomography, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging, revealed a suspicious gallbladder mass with wall thickening and regional lymphadenopathy, raising concern for malignancy. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration and subsequent immunophenotyping confirmed a diagnosis of PFL. The patient underwent radical cholecystectomy with lymphadenectomy, and histopathological examination corroborated the diagnosis of gallbladder follicular lymphoma. During follow-up, the patient developed complications, yet no evidence of lymphoma recurrence was observed. A literature review identified 8 similar cases, further emphasizing the rarity of this presentation. Future research should focus on optimizing diagnostic techniques, refining therapeutic strategies, and conducting longer-term follow-up studies to better assess patient outcomes in such a rare disease. This case highlights the need for heightened clinical suspicion and comprehensive evaluation in atypical presentations of extranodal lymphoma."

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's disease, due to their multifaced and complicated nature, remain uncurable and impose substantial financial and human burdens on society. Therefore, developing new innovative therapeutic strategies is vital. In this context, drug repurposing has emerged as a promising avenue to expedite the development of treatments for these challenging conditions. One particularly compelling target in this regard is the chaperone protein sigma-1 receptor (S1R), which has garnered significant attention for its neuroprotective properties. Interestingly, several medications, including fluvoxamine (an antidepressant), dextromethorphan (a cough suppressant), and amantadine (an antiviral), which were initially developed for unrelated indications, have shown encouraging results in neurodegenerative therapy through S1R activation. These findings suggest that existing drugs in pharmacopeias can play an essential role in alleviating neurodegenerative symptoms by modulating S1R, thereby offering a faster route and cost-effective path to clinical applications compared to the de novo development of entirely new compounds. Furthermore, as a synergistic benefit, combining S1R-targeting drugs with other therapeutic agents may also improve treatment efficacy. In this review, we highlight key repurposed drugs targeting S1R and explore their mechanisms of action, shedding light on their emerging therapeutic potential in the fight against neurodegeneration."

    "title": "Reversing Epigenetic Dysregulation in Neurodegenerative Diseases: Mechanistic and Therapeutic Considerations.",
    "abstract": "Epigenetic dysregulation has emerged as an important player in the pathobiology of neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs), such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's diseases. Aberrant DNA methylation, histone modifications, and dysregulated non-coding RNAs have been shown to contribute to neuronal dysfunction and degeneration. These alterations are often exacerbated by environmental toxins, which induce oxidative stress, inflammation, and genomic instability. Reversing epigenetic aberrations may offer an avenue for restoring brain mechanisms and mitigating neurodegeneration. Herein, we revisit the evidence suggesting the ameliorative effects of epigenetic modulators in toxin-induced models of NDDs. The restoration of normal gene expressions, the improvement of neuronal function, and the reduction in pathological markers by histone deacetylase (HDAC) and DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitors have been demonstrated in preclinical models of NDDs. Encouragingly, in clinical trials of Alzheimer's disease (AD), HDAC inhibitors have caused improvements in cognition and memory. Combining these beneficial effects of epigenetic modulators with neuroprotective agents and the clearance of misfolded amyloid proteins may offer synergistic benefits. Reinforced by the emerging methods for more effective and brain-specific delivery, reversibility, and safety considerations, epigenetic modulators are anticipated to minimize systemic toxicity and yield more favorable outcomes in NDDs. In summary, although still in their infancy, epigenetic modulators offer an integrated strategy to address the multifactorial nature of NDDs, altering their therapeutic landscape."

    "abstract": "The neurotrophic system includes neurotrophins, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its precursor proBDNF, which play conflicting roles in neuronal survival and apoptosis, with their balance having a significant impact on neurodegenerative outcomes. While BDNF is widely acknowledged as a potent neurotrophin that promotes neuronal survival and differentiation, its precursor, proBDNF, has the opposite effect, promoting apoptosis and neuronal death. This review highlights the new and unique aspects of BDNF/proBDNF interaction in the modulation of neuronal apoptotic pathways in neurodegenerative disorders. It systematically discusses the cross-talk in apoptotic signaling at the molecular level, whereby BDNF activates survival pathways such as PI3K/Akt and MAPK/ERK, whereas proBDNF activates p75NTR and sortilin to induce neuronal apoptosis via JNK, RhoA, NFkB, and Rac-GTPase pathways such as caspase activation and mitochondrial injury. Moreover, this review emphasizes the factors that affect the balance between proBDNF and BDNF levels within the context of neurodegeneration, including proteolytic processing, the expression of TrkB and p75NTR receptors, and extrinsic gene transcription regulators. Cellular injury, stress, or signaling pathway alterations can disrupt the balance of BDNF/proBDNF, which may be involved in apoptotic-related neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's diseases. This review provides a comprehensive framework for targeting neurotrophin signaling in the development of innovative therapies for neuronal survival and managing apoptotic-related neurodegenerative disorders, addressing the mechanistic complexity and clinical feasibility of BDNF/proBDNF interaction."

Genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors, which include dietary habits, interact with aging and influence brain health, thus having an impact on the development of neurodegenerative disorders. In this context, fungal-derived bioactive compounds have emerged as promising neuroprotective agents due to their diverse biological properties that include antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, pro-autophagic, and neurotrophic effects. Key fungal metabolites, including polysaccharides, terpenoids, alkaloids, and phenolic compounds have been shown to modulate neuroinflammatory pathways, enhance neuronal survival, stimulate protective autophagy, and promote synaptic plasticity. Still, challenges related to their bioavailability, standardization, and clinical translation remain unresolved. Future deep research will be crucial to unlocking the full therapeutic potential of fungal-derived neuroprotective compounds. This review examines the potential therapeutic role of fungal metabolites, providing a comparative evaluation with a focus on their mechanisms of action in promoting brain health and longevity."

    "title": "A Strategy Potentially Suitable for Combined Preimplantation Genetic Testing of Aneuploidy and Monogenic Disease That Permits Direct Detection of Pathogenic Variants Including Repeat Expansions and Gene Deletions.",
    "abstract": "Combined preimplantation genetic testing of aneuploidy (PGT-A) and monogenic disease (PGT-M) can be achieved through PCR-based whole genome amplification (WGA) and next-generation sequencing (NGS). However, pathogenic variant detection is usually achieved indirectly through single nucleotide polymorphism haplotyping, as direct detection of pathogenic variants is not always possible. We evaluated whether isothermal WGA was suitable for combined PGT-A and PGT-M that also permitted direct detection of repeat expansions and large deletions, in addition to indirect linkage analysis using microsatellite markers. Five-cell replicates from selected cell lines were subjected to isothermal or PCR-based WGA, followed by NGS-based PGT-A and direct and indirect PGT-M of Huntington's disease and spinal muscular atrophy. Both WGA methods accurately detected aneuploidy and large (10 Mb) segmental imbalances. However, isothermal WGA produced higher genotyping accuracy compared with PCR-based WGA for all analysed microsatellite markers (93.5% vs. 75.6%), as well as at the <i>HTT</i> CAG repeat locus (100% vs. 7.7%) and the <i>SMN1/2</i> locus (100% vs. 71.8%). These results demonstrate that isothermal WGA is potentially ideal for combined PGT-A and PGT-M that permits both direct and indirect detection of pathogenic variants including repeat expansions and gene deletions."

    "abstract": "Susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) is a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequence sensitive to substances that alter the local magnetic field, such as calcium and iron, allowing phase information to distinguish between them. SWI is a 3D gradient-echo sequence with high spatial resolution that leverages both phase and magnitude effects. The interaction of paramagnetic (such as hemosiderin and deoxyhemoglobin), diamagnetic (including calcifications and minerals), and ferromagnetic substances with the local magnetic field distorts it, leading to signal changes. Neurodegenerative diseases are typically characterized by the progressive loss of neurons and their supporting cells within the neurovascular unit. This cellular decline is associated with a corresponding deterioration of both cognitive and motor abilities. Many neurodegenerative disorders are associated with increased iron accumulation or microhemorrhages in various brain regions, making SWI a valuable diagnostic tool in clinical practice. Suggestive SWI findings are known in Parkinson's disease, Lewy body dementia, atypical parkinsonian syndromes, multiple sclerosis, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, hereditary ataxias, Huntington's disease, neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation, and chronic traumatic encephalopathy. This review will assist radiologists in understanding the technical framework of SWI sequences for a correct interpretation of currently established MRI findings and for its potential future clinical applications."

    "abstract": "Dysfunction of the lysosome and autophagy-lysosome pathway is closely associated with various diseases, such as neurodegenerative diseases, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), etc. Additionally, chloroquine is a clinically widely used drug for treating malaria and autoimmune diseases, but long-term or high-dose administration may lead to significant toxic side effects. Attapulgite (ATT), a natural nanomaterial with excellent adsorption capacity and biocompatibility, herein demonstrated a novel biological function in regulating the lysosomal and autophagy-lysosome pathway. ATT could be effectively internalized into lysosome-related acidic compartments. Further study revealed that ATT could restore lysosomal pH, activate cathepsin D, alleviate autophagy blockage in chloroquine-treated cells, and reduce chloroquine-elicited cell death. In a cell model related to Huntington's disease, treatment with ATT reinforced the degradation of the mutant huntingtin proteins by increasing cathepsin D maturation and autophagy flux. ATT could also promote lipid droplet clearance in hepatocytes with palmitic acid-induced steatosis, reduce hepatic lipid accumulation, and improve fasting blood glucose in high-fat-diet-induced NAFLD mice. These findings establish ATT as a lysosomal modulator, providing a foundation for its therapeutic potential in mitigating the adverse effects associated with long-term chloroquine use, especially improving neurodegenerative and metabolic disorders."

    "title": "Modelling Population Genetic Screening in Rare Neurodegenerative Diseases.",
    "abstract": "<b>Importance:</b> Genomic sequencing enables the rapid identification of a breadth of genetic variants. For clinical purposes, sequencing for small genetic variations is considered a solved problem, while challenges remain for structural variants, given the lower sensitivity and specificity. Interest has recently risen among governing bodies in developing protocols for population-wide genetic screening. However, usefulness is constrained when the probability of being affected by a rare disease remains low, despite a positive genetic test. This is a common scenario in neurodegenerative disorders. The problem is recognised among statisticians and statistical geneticists but is less well-understood by clinicians and researchers who will act on these results, and by the general public who might access screening services directly without the appropriate support for interpretation. <b>Observations:</b> We explore the probability of subsequent disease following genetic screening of several variants, both single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and larger repeat expansions, for two neurological conditions, Huntington's disease (HD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), comparing these results with screening for phenylketonuria, which is well-established. The risk following a positive screening test was 0.5% for <i>C9orf72</i> in ALS and 0.4% for <i>HTT</i> in HD when testing repeat expansions, for which the test had sub-optimal performance (sensitivity = 99% and specificity = 90%), and 12.7% for phenylketonuria and 10.9% for ALS <i>SOD1</i> when testing pathogenic SNVs (sensitivity = 99.96% and specificity = 99.95%). Subsequent screening confirmation via PCR for <i>C9orf72</i> led to a 2% risk of developing ALS as a result of the reduced penetrance (44%). <b>Conclusions and Relevance:</b> We show that risk following a positive screening test result can be strikingly low for rare neurological diseases, even for fully penetrant variants such as <i>HTT</i>, if the test has sub-optimal performance. Accordingly, to maximise the utility of screening, it is vital to prioritise protocols with very high sensitivity and specificity, and a careful selection of markers for screening, giving regard to clinical interpretability, actionability, high penetrance, and secondary testing to confirm positive findings."

    "abstract": "TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) pathology is linked to the neurodegenerative disorders amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and Huntington disease (HD). Dysregulation of metabolism and emotion is shared across these disorders and may be caused by hypothalamic pathology. Inclusions with TDP-43 are present in the hypothalamus in clinical ALS, as well as selective loss of hypothalamic neurons expressing the metabolism and emotion regulating neuropeptides hypocretin (orexin), melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) and oxytocin. We aimed to investigate whether there is a casual link between the effects of TDP-43 in the hypothalamus and the development of neuropathology, as well as changes in metabolism and behavior. We generated an adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector expressing human TDP-43 under the neuronal-specific synapsin promoter, which was injected bilaterally into the hypothalamus of wild-type FVB/N mice. TDP-43 overexpression resulted in hypothalamic pathology in a dose-dependent fashion replicating clinical pathology with hypothalamic atrophy and loss of hypocretin-, MCH- and oxytocin-expressing neurons. Nuclear and cytoplasmic inclusions of TDP-43 were found in the hypothalamus. Mice overexpressing TDP-43 in the hypothalamus developed metabolic dysregulation with hyperglycaemia independent of food intake. Additionally, mice overexpressing TDP-43 in the hypothalamus exhibited reduced motor activity and nesting ability, suggesting the development of an apathy-like phenotype. Taken together, AAV-vector mediated TDP-43 overexpression in the hypothalamus leads to neuropathology with the development of metabolic dysfunction and apathy-like behavior. These results indicate that TDP-43 can exert direct pathological effects in the hypothalamus, which may contribute to the development of the non-motor phenotype in TDP-43 proteinopathies."

    "abstract": "Inflammation and insulin resistance are associated with increased mortality in the general population. However, it remains unclear how physical activity and proinflammatory/hyperinsulinemic diets influence overall survival in prostate cancer patients. We analyzed 4779 men with nonmetastatic prostate cancer from the Health Professionals Follow-up Study. Postdiagnosis physical activity and diet were assessed using validated self-reported questionnaires. We used the validated dietary scores to empirically assess the anti-inflammatory (rEDIP) and anti-insulinemic (rEDIH) potential of dietary patterns based upon specific combinations of food groups. Cox regression model was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). During a median of 15 years of follow-up, we identified 2282 deaths. Compared to men with < 3 MET-h/week of postdiagnosis physical activity, multivariable-adjusted HRs (95% CI) were 0.80 (0.68-0.95) for 9-< 24 MET-h/week, 0.63 (0.53-0.75) for 24-< 48 MET-hours/week and 0.61 (0.51-0.73) for ≥ 48 MET-hours/week in relation to all-cause mortality (P-trend < 0.001). Both vigorous and non-vigorous activities after diagnosis were associated with lower all-cause mortality (P-trend < 0.001). Moreover, post-diagnosis rEDIP and rEDIH scores were inversely associated with all-cause mortality (HR per 1-SD increase: 0.93 (0.89-0.99) for rEDIP; 0.91 (0.86-0.96) for rEDIH). In joint analyses, men with high physical activity and high rEDIP (or rEDIH) score showed approximately 30-36% lower risks of all-cause mortality, compared to those with low physical activity and low diet scores. In conclusion, high physical activity and low proinflammatory and hyperinsulinemic diets were independently associated with decreased risk of all-cause mortality in men with prostate cancer. Men with both high physical activity and low proinflammatory and hyperinsulinemic diets after diagnosis have the lowest mortality rate."

    "abstract": "Neurodegeneration in Huntington disease (HD) contributes to dopaminergic system dysfunction via the loss of striatal medium spiny neurons expressing dopamine receptors. Given the key role for ascorbic acid (vitamin C) in dopamine synthesis and neurotransmission, we investigated whether mild cellular ascorbate deficiency accelerates dopaminergic dysfunction in the development of HD pathology and behavioral deficits. YAC128 mice expressing mutant human huntingtin were crossed with SVCT2<sup>+/-</sup> mice, which carry a heterozygous knockout of the sodium-dependent vitamin C transporter, to generate mice with approximately 30% decreased neuronal vitamin C as well as progressive changes in dopamine signaling. Behavioral and neurochemical outcomes were assessed at early disease stages. At 14 and 20 weeks, YAC128 and SVCT2<sup>+/-</sup> YAC128 mice showed similar deficits in grip strength, locomotor activity, and rotarod performance compared to controls, suggesting modest ascorbate deficiency did not accelerate motor phenotypes. Gene expression analysis revealed six significantly upregulated genes in the striatum of SVCT2<sup>+/-</sup> YAC128 mice, including those involved in dopamine synthesis, packaging, and transport. Notably, striatal dopamine and serotonin and their metabolites were decreased in both single mutant mouse lines (YAC128 and SVCT2<sup>+/-</sup>) but without a compounding effect of the double mutation (SVCT2<sup>+/-</sup> YAC128). These results indicate that while moderate ascorbate deficiency may not worsen early behavioral phenotypes in the YAC128 model, it does impact dopamine system regulation at the molecular level. These findings highlight the potential importance of ascorbate in modifying disease progression and suggest that humans with HD, who cannot synthesize ascorbate, may be particularly vulnerable to vitamin C deficiency effects on dopamine dynamics."

    "title": "Clinical Practice Guideline: Surgical Management of Chronic Rhinosinusitis.",
    "abstract": "The purpose of this specialty-specific clinical practice guideline is to identify quality improvement opportunities and provide clinicians with trustworthy, evidence-based recommendations for the surgical management of chronic rhinosinusitis in adults. The target audience includes otolaryngologist-head and neck surgeons who manage adults with chronic rhinosinusitis, including candidacy and performance of endoscopic sinus surgery. This guideline was developed using the 55-page protocol published as the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation's Clinical Practice Guideline Development Manual (3rd edition), which summarizes the methodology for assessments of current data, topic prioritization, development of key action statements (KASs), application of value judgments, and related procedures. The guideline group represented otolaryngologists, rhinologists, advanced practice nursing and physician assistants, and consumers who represented participating national professional organizations. The Guideline Development Group made strong recommendations for the following KASs: Before considering surgery, the surgeon should verify an existing diagnosis of chronic rhinosinusitis to ensure established diagnostic criteria (signs and symptoms) from clinical practice guidelines are met, and the surgeon should assess candidacy for sinus surgery based on symptoms, disease characteristics, quality of life, and prior medical or surgical therapy (KASs 1A and 1B). The surgeon or their designee should not prescribe antibacterial therapy to an adult with chronic rhinosinusitis if significant or persistent purulent nasal discharge (anterior, posterior, or both) is absent on examination (KAS 3). The Guideline Development Group made recommendations for the following KASs: The surgeon should not endorse or require a predefined, one-size-fits-all regimen or duration of medical therapy (eg, antibiotics, steroids, antihistamines) as a prerequisite to sinus surgery for an adult with chronic rhinosinusitis (KAS 2). The surgeon should identify patients with chronic rhinosinusitis that would benefit most from surgery and are least likely to benefit from continued medical therapy alone, such as those with chronic rhinosinusitis subtypes that include, but are not limited to, chronic rhinosinusitis with polyps, polyps with bony erosion, eosinophilic mucin, or fungal balls (KAS 4). The surgeon or their designee should counsel patients before sinus surgery to establish realistic expectations, including the potential for chronicity or relapse, and the likelihood of long-term medical management, taking into account their chronic rhinosinusitis subtype (KAS 5). The surgeon should offer sinus surgery to an adult with chronic rhinosinusitis when the anticipated benefits exceed that of nonsurgical management alone, there is clarity regarding the anticipated outcomes, and the patient understands the expectation for long-term disease management following surgery (KAS 6). For an adult who is a candidate for sinus surgery, the surgeon or their designee should obtain a computed tomography (CT) scan with a fine-cut protocol, if not already available, to examine the paranasal sinuses for surgical planning (KAS 7). The surgeon should not plan the extent of sinus surgery (eg, which specific sinuses to operate on) solely based on arbitrary criteria regarding a minimal level of mucosal thickening, sinus opacification, or outflow obstruction on a CT scan (KAS 8). The surgeon or their designee should educate an adult with chronic rhinosinusitis who is scheduled for sinus surgery regarding anticipated postoperative care, specifically pain control, debridement, medical management, activity restrictions, return to work, duration and frequency of follow-up visits, and the potential for recurrent disease or revision surgery (KAS 9). When the sinus involves polyps, osteitis, bony erosion, or fungal disease in an adult with chronic rhinosinusitis who is scheduled for sinus surgery, the surgeon should perform sinus surgery that includes full exposure of the sinus cavity (lumen) and removal of diseased tissue, not just balloon or manual ostial dilation, or refer the patient to a surgeon who can perform this extent of surgery (KAS 10). The surgeon or their designee should routinely follow up to assess and document outcomes of sinus surgery for chronic rhinosinusitis, between 3 and 12 months after the procedure, through history (symptom relief, quality of life, complications, adherence to therapy, need for rescue medications, and ongoing care) and nasal endoscopy (KAS 11). There were no recommendations that were considered options from the Guideline Development Group."

    "title": "Impaired DNAJB2 Response to Heat Shock in Fibroblasts from a Neuropathy Patient with <i>DNAJB2/HSJ1</i> Mutation: Cystamine as a Potential Therapeutic Intervention.",
    "abstract": "<b>Background and Objectives:</b> Neuropathy is a debilitating disorder characterized by peripheral nerve dysfunction and damage to sensory, motor, and autonomic neurons and their axons. While homozygous mutations in DNAJB2/HSJ1 have been linked to early-onset neuropathy, a heterozygous DNAJB2 c.823+6C>T was discovered in an adult patient with severe sensory-motor polyneuropathy. This mutation is predicted to affect both isoforms of the protein. DNAJB2 (HSP40), a key member of the heat shock protein family, plays a critical role in cellular protection and stress, including response to heat shock. DNAJB2 traffics unfolded proteins to another heat shock protein, HSP70, and activates its ATPase activity to result in a correctly folded protein(s). In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of the heterozygous DNAJB2 c.823+6C>T mutation on the stress response of DNAJB2 in fibroblasts obtained from the neuropathy patient. <b>Methods:</b> The fibroblasts were subjected to one hour of heat shock at 42 °C, and the time course of expression levels of DNAJB2 was established. Additionally, we evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of Cystamine, which has been shown to modulate DNAJB2 levels in cellular and animal models of Huntington's disease. <b>Results:</b> Our results revealed reduced baseline levels of DNAJB2 between the mutant and control fibroblasts. Importantly the mutant cells exhibited a diminished response to heat shock. Thus, the mutation affects the upregulation of DNAJB2 under stress, possibly contributing to the pathogenesis of sensory-motor polyneuropathy. A 48-h pretreatment with 150 μM of Cystamine increased the levels of DNAJB2 in both the control and patient's fibroblasts. <b>Conclusions:</b> To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore this mutant form of DNAJB2 in neuropathy. The study demonstrated that the heterozygous DNAJB2 c.823+6C>T mutation leads to impaired DNAJB2 response to heat shock in the fibroblasts. Cystamine showed promise in restoring DNAJB2 expression, highlighting the need for further research into targeted therapeutic strategies for DNAJB2-related disorders."

    "abstract": "While neuropsychiatric symptoms are common in Huntington's Disease (HD), there is a dearth of evidence about the effectiveness of psychotropic medication for treating behavioral and cognitive symptoms. This article systematically reviews and aggregates the evidence of the effects of antidepressants on individuals with early HD. A systematic review and random-effects meta-analysis of RCTs comparing antidepressants to placebo in individuals with HD was performed, with a focus on outcomes of executive functioning, functional capacity, mood, motor function, and adverse events. A total of 4 studies with 123 of patients with early HD, of whom a total of 63 (51.2%) received an antidepressant, were identified in our search. In our pooled analysis, a modest but statistically significant improvement in mood resulted from antidepressant treatment in HD (OR -1.22; 95% CI -2.16,-0.27; <i>p</i> = 0.02). No significant differences in the other outcomes of interest were found following antidepressant exposure. Our investigation suggests that antidepressant use may modestly improve mood, but not ameliorate functional, cognitive, or movement-related symptoms in mild HD. Further studies involving novel agents, larger samples, and longer follow-up times are needed to better characterize the effect of antidepressants on neuropsychiatric symptoms in HD."

The CAG•CTG sequence is found in approximately one-third of pathogenic TNR loci, including the HTT gene that causes Huntington's disease. Friedreich's ataxia, the most prevalent hereditary ataxia, results from GAA repeat expansion at the FXN gene. Here we used cytosine and adenine base editing to reduce the repetitiveness of TNRs in patient cells and in mice. Base editors introduced G•C>A•T and A•T>G•C interruptions at CAG and GAA repeats, mimicking stable, nonpathogenic alleles that naturally occur in people. AAV9 delivery of optimized base editors in Htt.Q111 Huntington's disease and YG8s Friedreich's ataxia mice resulted in efficient editing in transduced tissues, and significantly reduced repeat expansion in the central nervous system. These findings demonstrate that introducing interruptions in pathogenic TNRs can mitigate a key neurological feature of TNR diseases in vivo."

Improved clinical diagnostic workups and the development and tracking of successful disease-modifying treatments are made possible by detecting appropriate neurodegenerative disease (ND) biomarkers. Important biomarkers, such as Tau proteins, amyloid-β, and α-synucleins, are essential for precise identification but are often evaluated using time-consuming, expensive, and traditional techniques like polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Due to its exceptional selectivity and sensitivity, electrochemical biosensing has become a popular, low-cost substitute for more conventional diagnostic methods. Nanoparticles in biosensors are particularly noteworthy because they improve electron transport and aid in immobilizing biorecognition components. Conducting polymers have shown great potential in the field of electrochemical sensing. Conducting polymers have shown great potential in electrochemical sensing. Additionally, research has shown that polypyrrole, polyaniline, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene), and poly(thiophene) are often regarded as among the best conducting polymers for fabricating electrochemical sensors. Moreover, a hydrogel biosensor allows for the detection of many parameters simultaneously with real-time monitoring, allowing for more accurate and timely tracking of multiple indicators of a patient. Hydrogel nano(bio)composite sensors that use electrochemical transduction methods to detect analytes are also available. Hydrogel-based polymer sensors for early-stage neurodegenerative diagnosis are examined in this review in a novel way. Afterward, we reviewed electrochemical sensors developed for detecting biomarkers related to diseases, including multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's. There have also been developments devised to enhance efficacy of electrochemical diagnostic tools to address their limitations. In this respect, we have also reviewed many polymers used in electrochemical diagnosis of neurological disorders.

    "abstract": "Currently, new research projects aim to develop prognostic models that more accurately predict the age of onset and progression of disease for adult-onset autosomal dominant neurodegenerative diseases that lack disease-modifying treatments. While such predictions can be important for medical research and valuable in clinical practice, the perspectives of mutation carriers on receiving onset and progression predictions have not yet been explored. In this Dutch qualitative interview study, conducted between May and August 2023, the preferences, views, and concerns of 25 asymptomatic mutation carriers of Huntington's Disease, Spinocerebellar Ataxia type 1, or Spinocerebellar Ataxia type 3 regarding onset and progression predictions were examined. Reasons for wanting to receive onset and progression predictions included life planning, preparing for the disease, informing family members, and reducing uncertainty and hypervigilance. Reasons against included concerns about negative psychological effects, the expectation of similar disease progression as family members, and a preference for receiving progression information at a later stage. Most participants were open towards disclosure of onset predictions but more hesitant regarding receiving progression information. The reasons expressed and the preferred predicted age ranges varied among age groups, and some differences in preferences were observed between the three diseases. These findings may guide the development and responsible implementation of such prognostic models and can support healthcare professionals in the counselling of mutation carriers of adult-onset genetic neurodegenerative diseases."

Participants receive care from multiple clinical specialists, who collaborate to perform deep phenotyping and state-of-the-art multi-omics analyses. As bioinformatics of short-read sequencing has matured, the discovery of repeat expansion disorders (REDs) is accelerating. REDs comprise ∼60 characterized disorders, which exhibit a broad spectrum of phenotypes. Thus, a largely unbiased genome-wide approach in a phenotypically diverse sample will add to the diagnostic depth, explore the limits of short-read genome analysis, and establish novel candidate RED loci. Methods Here, we present a genome-wide analysis of repeat expansions conducted on 1,018 genomes from the UDN. By leveraging two distinct bioinformatics tools, ExpansionHunter Denovo and STRling, we show that repeat expansions can be accurately detected in short-read genomes. Results We demonstrate that a genotype-first approach can diagnose atypical cases of known REDs and provide valuable clinical insights. We present clinical details on participants with expansions in ATXN7, DMPK, FMR1, GLS, HTT, RFC1, AFF3, and MARCH6. Importantly, we highlight two cases of juvenile Huntington disease that were discovered through our analysis. Finally, we present a list of novel candidate TRs that could potentially be pathogenic if expanded. Conclusion Importantly, our approach showcases the bioinformatic advancements in genome analysis for RED detection and highlights its practical applications."

    "abstract": "Mature plasmacytoid dendritic cell proliferation (MPDCP) is a rare, clonal but nonmalignant entity often associated with myeloid neoplasms such as chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), myelodysplastic syndromes, and acute myeloid leukemia. While typically confined to the bone marrow, nodal MPDCP is exceedingly rare and may mimic blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN), posing diagnostic challenges. We report a 78-year-old male with CMML-1 and progressive cervical lymphadenopathy. Workup revealed monocytosis, ASXL1 and CBL mutations, and CMML. Lymph node biopsy showed paracortical expansion by small mononuclear cells with plasmacytoid features. Immunophenotyping identified a CD4+, CD123+, CD303+, HLA-DR+, lysozyme+, CD56- population, consistent with MPDCP. A subset expressed TdT and granzyme B, with a Ki-67 index of 20% to 30%. Next-generation sequencing confirmed the same ASXL1 and CBL mutations in the lymph node, supporting clonal relation to CMML. Key differential diagnoses included BPDCN, T-cell lymphomas, Langerhans cell histiocytosis, and Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease. Absence of CD56, mature cytomorphology, and molecular concordance favored MPDCP. This case highlights the importance of distinguishing nodal MPDCP from malignant mimics. MPDCP may reflect immune evasion, altered cytokine signaling, or clonal progression in myeloid neoplasms. The patient was initially treated with hydroxyurea, later transitioned to decitabine/cedazuridine (Inqovi) for disease progression. Follow-up marrow biopsy showed stable CMML-2 with persistent mutations, and the patient remains under close monitoring. Recognizing MPDCP in unusual locations is critical for accurate diagnosis and prognostication. Further studies are warranted to clarify its molecular pathogenesis and potential as a biomarker of disease evolution in CMML and related disorders."

Dysbiosis influences immune responses and HD pathogenesis through microbial metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). We discuss advanced mathematical models, telemedicine, and biosensors for tracking HD progression and detecting gut dysbiosis. Nutritional interventions to restore microbiota balance and using artificial intelligence and machine learning to predict disease prognosis and personalized treatments have been highlighted. Based on their unique immune profiles and gut microbiota, personalized medicine has been proposed as a promising strategy for effective HD treatment."

    "abstract": "N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is an effective pleiotropic drug with a strong safety profile. It is predominantly used as a mucolytic agent and in the treatment of paracetamol overdose. However, extensive research in the last decade has shown the prominent efficacy of NAC in many neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. NAC acts through multiple mechanisms; primarily, it releases cysteine and modulates glutamatergic and monoaminergic transmission. Further, it restores glutathione levels, promotes oxidative balance, reverses decreased synaptic plasticity, reduces neuroinflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction, and provides neurotrophic support. Additionally, it regulates one-carbon metabolism pathways, leading to the production of key metabolites. In this review, we will be discussing in-depth mechanisms of action of NAC and its promising ability to reverse neuropathological changes, cognitive deficits and associated plasticity changes in various psychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases, including depression, bipolar disorders, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, traumatic brain injury, aging. Overall, several preclinical studies and clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of NAC in reversing regressive plasticity, cognitive deficits, and associated changes in the brain.

Here, we found that the autophagic marker Atg8-PE was upregulated through the target of rapamycin complex 1 signaling pathway in <i>Nd</i>. However, as autophagy substrates, SQSTM1/p62 and ubiquitinated protein levels increased in <i>Nd</i>. Furthermore, treatment with BafA1 showed no effect on the protein levels of SQSTM1/p62, indicating impaired autophagic flux in <i>Nd</i>. Abnormal acidification of lysosomes was further detected, which resulted in a decreased proportion of matured CtsL1 (cathepsin L1). Thus, the substrate in autolysosomes cannot be degraded within a rapid time frame, resulting in the accumulation of protein aggregates, which cause atrophy and degeneration of the PSG. We also found that acidic nanoparticles rescued lysosomal acidification and relieved the degenerative changes of <i>Nd</i>-PSG. The findings of this study suggest that the <i>Nd</i> mutant silkworm can be used as an animal model for studying protein aggregation diseases.<b>Abbreviations</b>: AD: Alzheimer disease; aNP: acidic nanoparticle; APP: amyloid beta precursor protein; Atg8: autophagy related 8; BACE1: beta-secretase 1; BafA1: bafilomycin A<sub>1</sub>; CtsL1: cathepsin L1; CRY: crystallin; ER: endoplasmic reticulum; FibH: fibroin heavy chain; FibL: fibroin light chain; FUS: FUS RNA binding protein; HD: Huntington disease; HRP: horseradish peroxidase; <i>Nd</i>: naked pupa; OSBPL2: oxysterol binding protein like 2; PD: Parkinson disease; PE: phosphatidylethanolamine; p-EIF4EBP: phosphorylated eukaryotic initiation factor 4E binding protein; PROM1: prominin 1; p-RPS6KB: phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6 kinase B; PSEN: presenilin; PSG: posterior silk gland; SDS-PAGE: sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; SEM: standard error of the mean; SOD1: superoxide dismutase 1; SQSTM1/p62: sequestosome 1; TARDBP: TAR DNA binding protein; TORC1: target of rapamycin complex 1; UBQLN2: ubiquilin 2; V-ATPase: vacuolar-type ATPase."

    "abstract": "Neurite growth is regulated by NADPH Oxidase (NOX1 and 2) and in this study, we investigate whether neuritic abnormalities observed in stem cell models of Huntington's disease relates to altered NOX function during NGF-driven differentiation of PC12 neuronal cells. NOX1 and 2 were contained in separate vesicular compartments, and by overexpression inhibited or promoted neurite extension, respectively. Expression of mutant Htt (mHtt; exon 1 fragment) accelerated neuronal induction causing longer neurites in the first phase of differentiation, but fewer and shorter mature neurites. Htt/mHtt increased NOX2 protein levels but did not change global oxidant production; However, Htt/mHtt prominently redistributed NOX activity to neurites. Oxidant production was concentrated in intraluminal vesicles in multivesicular bodies, and mHtt specifically increased secretion of NOX1 in exosomes, which demonstrated oxidant production capacity, while rerouting NOX2 to lysosomal degradation. Knockdown of TSG101, required for intraluminal vesicle formation, increased cellular levels of NOX2/p22phox and neurite growth. Our study provides new insights on the disposition of NOX enzymes in nerve cells, indicating that deficient neurites in HD may be a correlate of altered trafficking, distribution, and activity of NOX."

A questionnaire about institutional practices and guidelines on PND for AOND was distributed through the National Society of Genetic Counselors, Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, and Huntington's Disease Society of America Centers of Excellence. Of 104 responses, 50 met eligibility criteria and were analyzed for commonalities and shared themes. Of those who provided responses, 80% reported that their institution does not have a formal protocol or written guidelines on PND for AOND. Challenges to PND for AOND included ethical decision making after a positive genetic result, double disclosure of fetal and parental status, and differing values among relevant stakeholders. Of those who provided responses, 100% indicated that national guidelines would be beneficial. This study helps establish the need for national guidelines on PND for AOND given that most institutions surveyed do not have standardized protocols. Points of consensus and shared areas of uncertainty may serve as starting points for the formation of national practice guidelines."

Participants included n = 233 predominantly cognitively unimpaired adults enrolled in the African Americans Fighting Alzheimer's in Midlife study. Subsamples had creatinine (n = 137) and positron emission tomography (PET; amyloid-PET = 65 [amyloid-PET-positive = 16/65]; tau-PET = 70). We tested whether p-tau217 (ALZPath, Inc.) varied by medical condition and amyloid- and tau-PET-positivity status and assessed the diagnostic accuracy of p-tau217. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <60 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and amyloid- and tau-PET-positive status demonstrated higher p-tau217. Effect sizes (r<sub>pb</sub>): eGFR <60 group = 0.48, CVD = 0.25, amyloid-PET-positive status = 0.54; tau-PET-positive status = 0.56. Lower eGFR was related to higher p-tau217 when adjusting for amyloid-PET. For abnormal amyloid-PET and tau-PET, p-tau217 exhibited areas under the curve of 0.90 and 0.89, respectively. Plasma p-tau217 showed promise as an Alzheimer's biomarker in Black adults; however, kidney function and CVD should be considered when interpreting levels. Plasma tau phosphorylated at threonine 217 (p-tau217) was tested in a sample of Black middle-aged and older adults. Level of p-tau217 was higher in impaired kidney function and cardiovascular disease. Obesity and diabetes were not related to p-tau217. Level of p-tau217 was higher in amyloid- and tau-PET-positive status. Plasma p-tau217 showed good receiver-operating characteristic area under the curve for abnormal amyloid- and tau-PET."

    "abstract": "Natural killer (NK) cells have evolved to detect abnormalities in tissues arising from infection with pathogens, genomic damage, or transformation and respond rapidly to the production of potent proinflammatory and cytolytic mediators. While this acute proinflammatory response is highly efficient at orchestrating sterilizing immunity to pathogens in a matter of days, cellular transformation often avoids the innate detection mechanisms of NK cells. When cellular transformation results in malignancy, tumor cells and/or the tumor microenvironment can evolve additional mechanisms to circumvent NK cell responses, and cancer is now a dominant disease burden worldwide. Here, we review recent advances in our understanding of the combined relationship between malignancies and natural killer (NK) cells, learn from recent clinical efforts in therapeutically targeting natural killer (NK) cells in cancer and outline some emerging therapeutic concepts that aim to improve the innate immune response against cancer."

    "abstract": "The tropomyosin-related tyrosine kinases or neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptors are a group of tyrosine kinases that play a crucial role in regulating neuronal growth and development. Neurotrophins are a class of protein-secreting cells that serve as the primary ligand for the Trk receptors. The four primary neurotrophins are nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived nerve factor (BDNF), neurotrophin-3, and neurotrophin-4/5. Mounting evidence suggests that Trk receptors can be categorized into three types: TrkA, TrkB, and TrkC. These receptors play a crucial role in facilitating neuronal growth and development. Trk receptors influence the survival and differentiation of neurons via many signalling cascades. Neurotrophin interaction with Trk receptors triggers a signalling cascade involving PLC, PI3K/Akt, and Ras/MAPK signalling pathways. Emerging evidence suggests that diminished neurotrophic support, changes in Trk receptor expression, or disruptions in signalling cascades play a crucial role in the development of various neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and many more. This review specifically explores therapeutic approaches targeting Trk receptors, their ligands, and Trk signaling in the context of various brain disorders. We focus on the potential for modulating or inhibiting Trk receptors as a treatment strategy for brain diseases."

It holds significant value for clinical applications and offers broad market potential due to the large patient population affected by various conditions. For instance, in 2023, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved 55 new drugs, including five specifically for gene therapy targeting hematologic and rare diseases. Recently, with advancements in understanding the pathogenesis and development of neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs), gene therapy has emerged as a promising avenue for treating Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), particularly in personalized medicine. Notably, the FDA has approved three clinical applications for combating SMA, utilizing viral vectors delivered via intravenous and intrathecal injections. However, gene therapy for other NDDs remains in clinical trials, necessitating improvements in viral vectors, exploration of new vectors, optimization of delivery routes, and further investigation into pathogenesis to identify novel targets.

    "abstract": "Despite the wealth of evidence suggesting a protective role of lifestyle factors on Huntington's disease (HD) onset and progression, their association with mortality has not been extensively studied. The aim of this study was to examine whether lifestyle factors such as caffeine and alcohol consumption, smoking, physical activity level, and Mediterranean diet (MeDi) adherence are associated with mortality among a Spanish cohort of patients with HD with a 9-year surveillance period. This national study was performed using a nested, observational, longitudinal design. We included subjects diagnosed with HD who participated in the European Huntington's disease network and Enrol-HD studies. Date of death and baseline lifestyle factor information, demographics, disease severity assessed by the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS), Problem Behaviours Assessment, total functional capacity (TFC) scores, and comorbidities were collected. Adjusted Cox proportional hazards models were conducted to determine the association of lifestyle factors with mortality. We included 87 patients (52 females) with a mean age of 48.62±14.43 years and CAG repeats of 43.76±5.92. Sixteen deaths were recorded. After correcting for multiple comparisons, deceased patients had higher UHDRS scores at baseline and lower caffeine consumption than live patients. In multivariate Cox regression models, after adjusting for age, CAG repeats, and TFC, mortality risk was associated with lower caffeine consumption (HR 0.13, 95% CI 0.04, 0.45). This national-based study suggests that increased caffeine consumption is associated with decreased HD mortality. Our results may help guide clinicians in counselling lifestyle practices for decreasing mortality in HD."

    "abstract": "Although an association between brain atrophy and decreased fine motor function has been reported, results from previous studies are inconsistent. We aimed to investigate whether decreased fine motor function is reflected in age- and sex-associated changes in brain structure across the adult lifespan in a large community dwelling cohort study. The Rhineland Study is an on-going population-based prospective cohort study in Bonn, Germany. We used cross-sectional data from the first 8318 participants of the Rhineland Study (age range: 30-95 years), who underwent baseline assessments between March 2016 and November 2022. A digital spiral drawing test was utilised to evaluate fine motor skills: tracing precision (deviation area), tracing velocity, and frequency of tremor. Brain volumetric and cortical thickness measures were obtained from 3T T1 MRI scans. The relationship between brain structure and fine motor function was examined with multivariable regression, while adjusting for age, sex, education, smoking status and grip strength. Smaller volumes and/or thinner cortices in several brain regions were associated with decreased tracing precision (higher tracing deviation area) and higher tremor frequency, including total brain volume (tracing area: β = -0.108, 95% CI = -0.180 to -0.037; tremor frequency: β = -0.077, 95% CI = -0.164 to -0.011), hippocampal volume (tracing area: β = -0.052, 95% CI = -0.089 to -0.015), and cortical thickness of the precentral gyrus (tracing area: β = -0.052, 95% CI = -0.082 to -0.023). Smaller total cerebellar volume (β = 0.061, 95% CI = 0.022-0.100) and total cerebellar grey matter volume (β = 0.060, 95% CI = 0.022-0.099) were both associated with lower tracing velocity. Women performed significantly better on all three dimensions of fine motor function, but age-associated changes in fine motor function did not differ between sexes. Our findings indicate that fine motor function is worse in older adults, and is better in women. Moreover, changes in total brain volume and the thickness of several key motor cortices are robustly related to fine motor function, with the strongest effect for tracing precision.

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) share key pathological features, including neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, autophagic dysfunction, and DNA damage. By identifying cytosolic DNA and triggering the type I interferon response, the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway regulates neuroinflammation. Dysregulated cGAS-STING signaling has been linked to neuroinflammation and neuronal degeneration across multiple neurodegenerative conditions. In many neurodegenerative disorders, neuroinflammation is mediated by the cGAS-STING pathway. Mitochondrial malfunction and impaired autophagy cause cytosolic DNA buildup in Huntington's, Parkinson's, and Alzheimer's diseases, which activates cGAS-STING and drives chronic inflammation. This pathway is triggered by TDP-43 pathology and nucleic acid dysregulation in ALS and FTD, which leads to neuronal destruction. Both central demyelination and peripheral immunological responses are linked to cGAS-STING activation in multiple sclerosis. Various inhibitors, such as RU.521, H-151, and naturally occurring compounds like metformin, potentially attenuate cGAS-STING-mediated neuroinflammation and associated pathologies. H-151 significantly decreased the expression of pro-inflammatory markers in murine macrophage J774 cells activated with cGAMP: TNF-α by 68 %, IFN-β by 84 %, and CXCL10 by 96 %. cGAS-STING inhibitors target neuroinflammation, offering a disease-modifying approach unlike current symptomatic treatments. However, challenges like blood-brain barrier penetration, off-target effects, and immune suppression hinder clinical translation, necessitating optimized drug delivery and immune modulation. With a focus on its potential for future clinical applications, this review explores the role of the cGAS-STING pathway in neurodegeneration and new treatment approaches."

Stem cells are classified based on their differentiation potential into totipotent, pluripotent, and multipotent stem cells. Among them, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are widely used in regenerative medicine due to their tissue regeneration capabilities and ability to differentiate into multiple cell types. Stem cells are being explored for treating neurodegenerative disorders like Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, Huntington's, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). These conditions result from progressive neuronal degeneration, leading to irreversible damage. Challenges such as cell survival, immune rejection, tumor formation, and ethical concerns related to embryonic stem cells need to be addressed. Nanotechnology is emerging as a tool for enhancing stem cell therapy, improving targeted delivery and effectiveness. Nanoparticles possess the ability to create microenvironments as substrates, facilitate targeted administration, and enable real-time, precise imaging of stem cells. This review explores the integration of stem cells and nanotechnology as regenerative medicine tool for neurodegenerative disease treatment, analyzing current strategies and therapeutic approaches. Integrating nanotechnology with stem cell therapy may significantly improve targeted delivery and enhance regenerative outcomes for neurodegenerative disorders."

While IH has been extensively studied, the independent effects of SF remain underexplored. This study investigated the cardiovascular impact of chronic SF in a murine model mimicking moderate-to-severe OSA. Male C57BL/6J mice were exposed to chronic SF or control conditions for 12 weeks. Mean blood pressure (MBP), cardiac function, pulse wave velocity (PWV), and coronary flow velocity reserve (CFVR) were assessed. Endothelium-dependent relaxation in aortic and coronary vessels was examined ex vivo, and aortic histological analysis evaluated intima-to-media thickness and collagen content. SF significantly elevated MBP (107 ± 8 mmHg vs. 89 ± 5 mmHg; p = 0.0001) and PWV (4.3 ± 0.6 m/s vs. 3.1 ± 0.2 m/s; p = 0.0001), indicating hypertension and arterial stiffness. Endothelium-dependent relaxation was impaired in coronary (67 ± 9 % vs. 86 ± 5 %; p = 0.0004) and aortic (73 ± 12 % vs. 87 ± 7 %; p = 0.045) vessels. Histology revealed increased intima-to-media thickness (128 ± 9 μm vs. 102 ± 14 μm; p = 0.008) and collagen deposition (56 ± 10 μm vs. 41 ± 7 μm; p = 0.027). Cardiac function and CFVR were unaffected. Chronic SF independently drives cardiovascular dysfunction through hypertension, arterial stiffness, endothelial impairment, and vascular remodeling. These findings emphasize SF as a distinct pathological factor in OSA, necessitating adjunctive interventions to mitigate cardiovascular risks."

Several astrocytic dysfunctions contribute to the pathophysiology of various neurodegenerative disorders, including Huntington's disease (HD), an autosomal-dominant neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized by motor and cognitive defects with behavioral/psychiatric disturbances. One dysfunction in HD related to astrocytes is reduced cholesterol synthesis, leading to a decreased availability of local cholesterol for synaptic activity. This review describes the specific role of astrocytes in the brain local cholesterol synthesis and presents evidence supporting a defective astrocyte-neuron cholesterol crosstalk in HD, by focusing on SREBP-2, the transcription factor that regulates the majority of genes involved in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway. The emerging coordination of SREBP-2 with other physiological processes, such as energy metabolism, autophagy, and Sonic Hedgehog signaling, is also discussed. Finally, this review intends to stimulate future research directions to explore whether the impairment of astrocytic SREBP-2-mediated cholesterol synthesis in HD associates with other cellular dysfunctions in the disease."

We conducted this bibliometric analysis to identify the key research hotspots and predict the future research directions of this field. Studies relating to the treatment of polyQ SCA published from 1999 to 2024 were retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection database. Relevant papers were selected using predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. HistCite, VOSviewer, CiteSpace, and alluvial generator were used in the bibliometric analysis. Overall, 935 papers were included. The number of publications in this field showed a trend toward a fluctuating increase. The United States and the University of Coimbra were the leading countries and institutions, respectively, in terms of publication number. The two most productive and highly cited authors were Luis Pereira de Almeida and Patricia Maciel. The journals Cerebellum, Human Molecular Genetics, and Movement Disorders were considered the most influential based on the number of publications and citations. Furthermore, \"new SCA types\", \"Huntington's disease\", \"clinical trial\", \"gene therapy\", \"disease models,\" and \"Aggregation clearance therapy\" emerged as current hotspots in this field, as revealed by the reference and keyword analyses. This study presents a systematic bibliometric analysis of research on the polyQ SCA treatment, which we hope will assist researchers in identifying the key topics and future research directions in this field."

These effects, attributed to the constant activation of multiple languages, may contribute to cognitive reserve, expressed as delayed cognitive decline in multilinguals diagnosed with progressive neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's, Huntington's and Parkinson's diseases, and Multiple Sclerosis. However, the evidence remains inconsistent due to methodological shortcomings, including variations in defining multilingualism and inadequate accounting for other lifestyle factors that may also promote cognitive reserve. To address these limitations, we developed a comprehensive protocol which incorporates detailed measurement of factors that are related to cognitive reserve, including multilingual experiences, standardized clinical and experimental cognitive assessments suitable for multilingual patients diagnosed with the above progressive neurological diseases, as well as thorough neuroimaging testing batteries. This protocol enables systematic investigation across linguistic and cultural contexts, facilitating cross-laboratory data pooling to advance understanding of multilingualism's neuroprotective potential in aging and disease. Its purpose is to spearhead an open-ended project which will keep adding to an increasing dataset of multilingual patients internationally; crucially, it sets a new standard in how to gather evidence investigating multilingualism as a factor contributing to cognitive reserve."

The transcription factor NF-κB1 is implicated in both neuroprotective and pro-inflammatory processes, with its activity varying between neurons and glial cells. While previous studies have explored the genetic and epigenetic contributions to these diseases, the infection hypothesis has re-emerged as a potential framework for identifying novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets. We conducted bulk RNA sequencing on human postmortem caudate nucleus tissue samples obtained from cognitively normal controls (<i>n</i> = 5), AD patients (<i>n</i> = 6), and PD patients (<i>n</i> = 3). Differential gene expression analysis and pathway enrichment were performed to identify dysregulated signaling mechanisms relevant to neuroinflammation and mitochondrial function. TNFα signaling through the NF-κB pathway was identified as a prominently dysregulated mechanism in both AD and PD samples. Transcript levels of NFE2L2 (NRF2) and NF-κB1 were elevated, coinciding with reduced expression of the mitochondrial transporter gene SLC25A6, suggesting a compensatory response to oxidative stress. Additionally, PLCG2 expression was markedly increased in microglial populations, reflecting heightened immune activation. A significant 10-fold reduction in hemoglobin subunit alpha (HbA1) RNA was observed in disease groups compared to controls, indicating compromised oxygen transport and cellular stress. These findings highlight candidate biomarkers and suggest that therapeutic strategies targeting mitochondrial integrity and neuroinflammation may be effective in AD and PD."

Global HD prevalence and incidence vary worldwide, though the highest numbers are reported in Latin American cluster regions. Within North America, there are disparities in diagnosis and outcomes among Black and Latino patients. Socioeconomic status, educational attainment, and sex were also associated with differences in diagnosis, access, and outcomes. Many of the recent studies in this review used the ENROLL-HD longitudinal study.

In the Q175 and/or TRGL/Q175 mice, mHTT was detected in autophagic vacuoles and also exhibited a high level of colocalization with autophagy receptors p62/SQSTM1 and ubiquitin in the IBs. Compared to the robust lysosomal pathology in late-stage human HD striatum, ALP alterations in Q175 models are also late-onset but milder, that included a lowered phospho-p70S6K level, lysosome depletion, and autolysosome elevation including more poorly acidified autolysosomes and larger-sized lipofuscin granules, reflecting impaired autophagic flux. Administration of a mTOR inhibitor to 6-mo-old TRGL/Q175 normalized lysosome number, ameliorated aggresome pathology while reducing mHTT-, p62-, and ubiquitin-immunoreactivities, suggesting the beneficial potential of autophagy modulation at early stages of disease progression."

    "abstract": "Glutamate excitotoxicity is intricately linked to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, exerting a profound influence on cognitive functions such as learning and memory in mammals. Glutamate, while crucial for these processes, can lead to neuronal damage and death when present in excessive amounts. Our previous review delved into the cascade of excitotoxic injury events and the underlying mechanisms of excitotoxicity. Building on that foundation, this update summarizes the latest research on the role of excitotoxicity in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, as well as new cutting-edge techniques applied in the study of excitotoxicity. We also explore the mechanisms of action of various excitotoxicity inhibitors and their clinical development status. This comprehensive analysis aims to enhance our understanding of the nexus between excitotoxicity and neurodegenerative diseases, offering valuable insights for therapeutic strategies in these conditions."

    "abstract": "Huntington's disease and other disorders of the basal ganglia create challenges for biomolecule-based medicines given the poor accessibility of these deep brain structures following intracerebral or intravascular delivery. Here, we found that low dose, low volume delivery of unbiased AAV libraries into the globus pallidus allowed recovery of novel capsids capable of broad access to key deep brain and cortical structures relevant for human therapies. One such capsid, AAV-DB-3, provided transduction of up to 45% of medium spiny neurons in the adult NHP striatum, along with substantial transduction of relevant deep layer neurons in the cortex. Notably, AAV-DB-3 behaved similarly in mice as in NHPs and potently transduced human neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells. Thus, AAV-DB-3 provides a unique AAV for network level brain gene therapies that translates up and down the evolutionary scale for preclinical studies and eventual clinical use."

    "abstract": "Over the recent years, numerous research efforts have been focused toward xanthones, a class of heterocyclic compounds characterized by a three-ring core structure and a diverse range of biological activities. Despite extensive studies, no xanthone-based molecule has successfully progressed through clinical trials to reach pharmaceutical applications. Xanthones belong to the class of secondary metabolites that exist naturally, found in various plant species, and their structural diversity has been further expanded through synthetic modifications to enhance their pharmacological efficacy. This review provides a comprehensive description of the therapeutic potential of xanthone derivatives within the scope of neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, and neuroinflammation. Existing literature has been rigorously examined to highlight the pharmacological relevance of xanthones in these disorders. Additionally, the pathophysiological aspects of each disease are discussed in detail to establish a mechanistic understanding of how xanthone derivatives may exert neuroprotective effects. Furthermore, the SAR of xanthones is explored to elucidate key molecular features responsible for their bioactivity, providing insights into rational drug design. By synthesizing and critically analyzing the existing research, this review is focused in highlighting the therapeutic relevance of xanthones in neurodegenerative diseases and their potential as lead candidates for further drug development."

    "title": "Pharmacological Regulation of Heat Shock Response via Aptamer-Antidote Couple.",
    "abstract": "Heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) orchestrates the cellular heat shock response (HSR) by binding to heat shock elements (HSEs) in the promoters of genes encoding heat shock proteins (HSPs). In a nonstressed state, HSF1 exists in a dormant complex with HSP90 and other chaperones. Upon cellular stress or upon inhibition of HSP90, HSF1 dissociates from the complex and activates the expression of HSPs to mitigate protein misfolding and aggregation. This study explores the potential of RNA aptamers selected against HSP90 to modulate HSF1 activity, with a role in Huntington's disease model characterized by protein aggregation. Selected aptamers disrupted the HSP90-HSF1 interaction, enhancing the binding of HSF1 with HSEs. This upregulated heat shock response (HSR) and reduced aggregation of Q74-huntingtin in Neuro 2a cells with improved cell survival. Designed antidote sequences could reverse the effect of the aptamers on the HSF1-HSE interaction, allowing for fine-tuning of HSR. Chronic activation of stress response pathways is deleterious for cellular fitness. Our findings suggest that coupling an antidote with an aptamer offers a novel therapeutic strategy to regulate cellular proteostasis under disease conditions."

    "abstract": "The 2022 outbreak of mpox affected more than 80,000 individuals worldwide, most of whom were men who have sex with men (MSM) who likely contracted the disease through close contact during sex. Given the unprecedented number of mpox infections and the new route of infection, there was substantial uncertainty about how best to manage the outbreak. We implemented a dynamic agent-based network model to simulate the spread of mpox in a United States-based MSM population. This model allowed us to implement data-informed dynamic network evolution to simulate realistic disease spreading and behavioral adaptations. We found that behavior change, the reduction in one-time partnerships, and widespread vaccination are effective in preventing the transmission of mpox and that earlier intervention has a greater effect, even when only a high-risk portion of the population participates. With no intervention, 16% of the population was infected (25th percentile, 75th percentiles of simulations: 15.3%, 16.6%). With vaccination and behavior change in only the 25% of individuals most likely to have a one-time partner, cumulative infections were reduced by 30%, or a total reduction in nearly 500 infections (mean: 11.3%, <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"> <mrow><msub><mi>P</mi> <mrow><mn>25</mn> <mo>%</mo></mrow> </msub> </mrow> </math> and <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"> <mrow><msub><mi>P</mi> <mrow><mn>75</mn> <mo>%</mo></mrow> </msub> </mrow> </math> : 9.6%, 13.5%). Earlier intervention further reduces cumulative infections; beginning vaccination a year before the outbreak results in only 5.5% of men being infected, averting 950 infections or nearly 10% of the total population in our model. We also show that sustained partnerships drive the early outbreak, while one-time partnerships drive transmission after the first initial weeks. The median effective reproductive number, <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"> <mrow><msubsup><mi>R</mi> <mo>∗</mo> <mi>t</mi></msubsup> </mrow> </math> , at <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mrow><mi>t</mi> <mo>=</mo> <mn>0</mn></mrow> </math> days is 1.30 for casual partnerships, 1.00 for main, and 0.6 for one-time.

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases as well as ataxias and fronto-temporal disorders are all characterized by the progressive accumulation of protein aggregates (amyloids) into inclusions bodies. In addition, recent experimental evidence is challenging the conventional view of the disease by revealing the ability of some of these disease-relevant proteins to be transferred between cells by means of extracellular vesicles (EVs), allowing the mutant protein to seed oligomers involving both the mutant and wild type forms of the protein. Abnormal secretion and levels of EVs are closely related to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases and contribute to disease progression. Numerous studies have proposed EVs as therapeutic targets or biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we summarize and discuss the role of small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) and autophagy in cellular quality control and turn-over of the major aggregation-prone proteins associated to neurodegenerative disorders. We also highlight the advanced research progress on mechanisms regulating unconventional secretion, secretory autophagy and EVs biogenesis and their contribution in the pathological processes underlining these diseases. Finally, we outline the latest research on the roles of EVs in neurodegenerative diseases and their potential diagnostic and therapeutic significance for the treatment of these clinically relevant conditions."

    "abstract": "Molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir-ritonavir are oral antivirals that have shown efficacy in preventing disease progression in outpatients with COVID-19. We aimed to evaluate these treatments for patients hospitalised with COVID-19 pneumonia, for whom data on these antivirals are scarce. The RECOVERY trial is a randomised, controlled, open-label, adaptive platform trial testing treatments for COVID-19. In this study we report the molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir-ritonavir comparisons from the RECOVERY trial. In each comparison, participants aged 18 years and older were randomly allocated (1:1) to the relevant antiviral (5 days of molnupiravir 800 mg twice daily or 300 mg nirmatrelvir and 100 mg ritonavir twice daily) in addition to usual care, or to usual care alone. The molnupiravir comparison was conducted at 75 hospitals in the UK, two in Nepal, and two in Indonesia; the nirmatrelvir-ritonavir comparison was conducted at 32 hospitals in the UK. Participants could take part in both comparisons. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, and secondary outcomes were time to discharge alive from hospital and progression to invasive ventilation or death. Analysis was by intention to treat. Both comparisons were stopped because of low recruitment. This study is registered with ISRCTN, 50189673, and ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04381936. From Jan 24, 2022, to May 24, 2023, 923 participants were recruited to the molnupiravir comparison (445 allocated to molnupiravir and 478 to usual care), and from March 31, 2022, to May 24, 2023, 137 participants were recruited to the nirmatrelvir-ritonavir comparison (68 allocated to nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and 69 to usual care). More than three-quarters of participants were vaccinated and had antispike antibodies at randomisation, and more than two-thirds were receiving other SARS-CoV-2 antivirals. In the molnupiravir comparison, 74 (17%) participants allocated to molnupiravir and 79 (17%) allocated to usual care died within 28 days (hazard ratio [HR] 0·93 [95% CI 0·68-1·28], p=0·66). In the nirmatrelvir-ritonavir comparison, 13 (19%) participants allocated to nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and 13 (19%) allocated to usual care died within 28 days (HR 1·02 [0·47-2·23], p=0·96). In neither comparison was there evidence of any difference in the duration of hospitalisation or the proportion of participants progressing to invasive ventilation or death. Adding molnupiravir or nirmatrelvir-ritonavir to usual care was not associated with improvements in clinical outcomes. However, low recruitment meant a clinically meaningful benefit of treatment could not be ruled out, particularly for nirmatrelvir-ritonavir.

    "title": "Berberine can be a Potential Therapeutic Agent in Treatment of Huntington's Disease: A Proposed Mechanistic Insight.",
    "abstract": "Huntington's disease (HD) is a genetic neurodegenerative disorder caused by CAG repeat expansion in the HTT gene, producing mutant huntingtin (mHTT) protein. This leads to neuronal damage through protein aggregation, transcriptional dysregulation, excitotoxicity, and mitochondrial dysfunction. mHTT impairs protein clearance and alters gene expression, energy metabolism, and synaptic function. Therapeutic strategies include enhancing mHTT degradation, gene silencing via antisense oligonucleotides and RNAi, promoting neuroprotection through BDNF signaling, and modulating neurotransmitters like glutamate and dopamine. Berberine, a natural isoquinoline alkaloid, has emerged as a promising therapeutic option for HD due to its multifaceted neuroprotective properties. Research indicates that berberine can mitigate the progression of neurodegenerative diseases, including HD, by targeting various molecular pathways. It exhibits antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and autophagy-enhancing effects, which are crucial in reducing neuronal damage and apoptosis associated with HD. These properties make berberine a potential candidate for therapeutic intervention in HD, as demonstrated in both cellular and animal models. Berberine activates the PI3K/Akt pathway, which is vital for cell survival and neuroprotection. It reduces oxidative stress and neuroinflammation, both of which are implicated in HD pathology. Berberine enhances autophagic processes, promoting the degradation of mutant huntingtin protein, a key pathological feature of HD. In transgenic HD mouse models, berberine administration has been shown to alleviate motor dysfunction and prolong survival. It effectively reduces the accumulation of mutant huntingtin in cultured cells, suggesting a direct impact on the disease's molecular underpinnings. Berberine's safety profile, established through its use in treating other conditions, supports its potential for clinical trials in HD patients. Its ability to modulate neurotransmitter levels and engage multiple signaling pathways further underscores its therapeutic promise. While berberine shows significant potential as a therapeutic agent for HD, further research is necessary to fully elucidate its mechanisms and optimize its clinical application. The current evidence in the review paper, primarily from preclinical studies, provides a strong foundation for future investigations into berberine's efficacy and safety in human HD patients."

While the exact causes remain elusive, it's believed that a combination of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors contribute to their development. Metabolites, the end products of cellular processes, reflect the physiological state of an organism. By analysing these molecules, researchers can gain a deeper understanding of the underlying metabolic changes associated with neurodegenerative disorders. This review aims to explore the possibilities between metabolites and their association with neurodegenerative disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Multiple sclerosis (MS) and Huntington's disease (HD). Metabolomic studies could potentially illuminate altered biochemical pathways, facilitating earlier detection and treatment of these conditions. Metabolomic investigations have revealed the role of oxidative stress, alterations in glucose and fat metabolism, mitochondrial dysfunction, apoptosis, glutamate excitotoxicity and alterations in myelin composition in neurodegenerative disorders. The common metabolic biomarkers identified includes glutamate, taurine, uric acid, branched chain amino acids, acylcarnitine, creatinine, choline, with some more amino acids and lipids. Metabolomics offers valuable insights into disease mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets by identifying biochemical and metabolic alterations, but still there are several aspects to be explored for accurate mapping of metabolites with specific pathway involved in the disease."

    "abstract": "Despite recent advances in burn management, burn injuries remain a major global cause of morbidity and mortality, with rural and underserved populations, such as those in Appalachia, being disproportionately affected. Contributing factors include limited access to specialized care and a high prevalence of comorbidities. Understanding the prognostic factors associated with mortality in adult burn patients is critical for guiding clinical care and resource allocation, particularly in resource-limited settings. This retrospective study analyzed data from adult burn patients aged 18 to 65 admitted to the only Burn Intensive Care Unit (BICU) in West Virginia, located at Cabell Huntington Hospital, between January 2017 and January 2023. A total of 748 patients were included. Variables analyzed included demographics, comorbidities (diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), smoking history, home oxygen use), injury characteristics (inhalation injury, total body surface area burned (TBSA)), and clinical outcomes (total hospital duration (THD), total ventilation duration (TVD)). Categorical and continuous variables were compared between survivors and non-survivors using chi-square and t-tests, respectively. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify independent predictors of mortality. The cohort consisted of 748 patients with a mortality rate of 3.6% (n = 27). Non-survivors were significantly older (mean age 56.1 vs. 40.2 years, <i>p</i> < 0.001), had higher mean TBSA (28.3% vs. 6.3%, <i>p</i> < 0.001), longer hospital stays (15.3 vs. 8.9 days, <i>p</i> = 0.012), and longer ventilation durations (18.5 vs. 6.7 days, <i>p</i> < 0.001). Inhalation injury was present in 66.7% of deceased patients compared to 14.1% of survivors (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Comorbidities such as diabetes (51.9% vs. 12.5%, <i>p</i> < 0.001), COPD (63.0% vs. 12.3%, <i>p</i> < 0.001), and home oxygen use (55.6% vs. 8.2%, <i>p</i> < 0.001) were significantly more prevalent in non-survivors. Smoking was also significantly associated with mortality (81.5% vs. 45.9%, <i>p</i> = 0.001). In the logistic regression analysis, independent predictors of mortality included TBSA (OR 1.15 per 1% increase, 95% CI: 1.10-1.21, <i>p</i> < 0.001), TVD (OR 1.08 per day, 95% CI: 1.02-1.14, <i>p</i> = 0.009), smoking history (OR 2.34, 95% CI: 1.15-4.78, <i>p</i> = 0.018), and inhalation injury (OR 6.82, 95% CI: 3.94-11.81, <i>p</i> < 0.001). THD was inversely associated with mortality (OR 0.93, 95% CI: 0.88-0.98, <i>p</i> = 0.008), possibly reflecting early deaths in more severe cases. In this Appalachian cohort of adult burn patients, mortality was significantly associated with larger burn size, prolonged ventilation, inhalation injury, smoking, and comorbidities such as diabetes, COPD, and home oxygen use. These findings highlight the need for individualized, multidisciplinary care strategies in resource-limited rural settings. Efforts to standardize inhalation injury diagnostics and enhance access to burn care may improve outcomes. Future studies should focus on scalable interventions and policy changes to reduce disparities in burn care and improve survival in underserved populations."

We present the case of a 23-year-old woman who presented to the clinic believing she was 14.2 weeks pregnant. However, she was found to have elevated beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) levels and a complex left adnexal mass. Initial ultrasound suggested an ovarian tumor, and surgical exploration revealed a large mixed germ cell tumor measuring 36.5 x 27 x 23.9 cm, weighing 9463.2 grams, with metastases to the small bowel, omentum, and peritoneum. Final pathology confirmed a high-grade immature teratoma and yolk sac tumor with a composition of 60% teratoma and 40% yolk sac tumor (YST). The patient underwent comprehensive staging surgery, including omentectomy, bowel resection, and lymphadenectomy, followed by four cycles of bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin (BEP) chemotherapy. Unfortunately, the patient has not responded to the standard chemotherapy regimen of BEP and will pursue further treatment through clinical trials. This case highlights the diagnostic challenge of MOGCTs, particularly mixed forms, which may present with nonspecific symptoms. Timely diagnosis and aggressive treatment, including fertility-preserving surgery when possible, are crucial for improving outcomes. Although survival rates are generally favorable, close follow-up is needed due to the potential for relapse, particularly in cases with advanced disease, as seen in our case. This case emphasizes the importance of considering MOGCTs in young women with elevated β-hCG and adnexal masses and the management of this metastatic disease."

Volumes of interest (VOIs) that either encompassed the entire organ or sampled regions of highest activity within larger organs were defined. Time-activity curves were derived from the PET data for each VOI, and analytical integration of its multi-exponential fit yielded the organ time-integrated activity. We generated human radiation dose estimates based on the scaled organ residence using OLINDA/EXM2.2. Highest retention was observed in the liver with total time-integrated activity of ~ 0.23 h. Absorbed organ dosimetry was highest in the liver (53.3 μGy/MBq), making it the critical organ. Gallbladder (35.9 μGy/MBq) and spleen (35.4 μGy/MBq) were the next highest organs for absorbed radiation dose. Effective doses were estimated to be 5.02 and 5.84 μSv/MBq for males and females, respectively. This nonhuman primate dosimetry study suggests intravenous doses up to 938 MBq of [<sup>11</sup>C]TZ1964B can be safely administered to human subjects for PET measurements of PDE10A activity. The tracer kinetic data is consistent with a hepatobiliary clearance pathway for the radiotracer."

How the Arg507His mutation affects FAN1 structure and enzymatic function is unknown. Using cryo-EM and biochemistry, we have discovered that FAN1 arginine 507 is critical for its interaction with PCNA, and mutation of Arg507 to His attenuates assembly of the FAN1-PCNA complex on a disease-relevant extrahelical DNA extrusions formed within DNA repeats. This mutation concomitantly abolishes PCNA-FAN1-dependent cleavage of such extrusions, thus unraveling the molecular basis for a specific mutation in FAN1 that dramatically hastens the onset of Huntington's disease.

To examine the role of PCNA on FAN1 activation, we solved the cryo-EM structures of a PCNA-FAN1-DNA complex. Our findings reveal that the FAN1 R507 residue directly interacts with PCNA D232. Biophysical interaction studies demonstrated that FAN1 enhances the binding affinity of PCNA for DNA, a synergistic effect disrupted in mutants carrying the R507H mutation. In contrast, PCNA does not affect the affinity of FAN1 for DNA but does modulate FAN1 activity upon ternary complex formation. The weakened and functionally altered FAN1 R507H-PCNA-DNA complex may partly impair the FAN1-mediated repair of CAG extrahelical extrusions, providing a potential explanation for the mutation's role in accelerating disease progression."

    "title": "Doxycycline: An essential tool for Alzheimer's disease.",
    "abstract": "The identification of active interventions in neurodegenerative disorders is a major challenge in neurology; the use of repurposed drugs may represent a valuable strategy. Tetracyclines, a second generation of antibiotic molecules, offer various potential applications. Following an anecdotal observation of the potential anti-amyloidogenic activity of iododoxorubicin, the search for chemical analogs with a better safety profile led to tetracyclines. Their heterocyclic structures with a planar conformation interfere with b-sheet amyloid formation. Thus, doxycycline, a derivative with favorable blood-brain barrier penetration, emerged as a strong candidate to combat peripheral and central amyloidosis. In particular, we tested the anti-prion activity of doxycycline in vitro and in vivo experiments, confirming its capacity to disrupt or inhibit the formation of prion protein aggregates associated with pathological events. Treatment with doxycycline in human subjects with prion - related encephalopathies yielded contradictory results, suggesting that a preventive approach is a more favorable condition to verify efficacy; a clinical trial involving subjects at genetic risk of developing fatal familial insomnia, exposed to doxycycline for ten years, is currently ongoing. The anti-amyloidogenic capacity of doxycycline, combined with its safety profile in long-term treatment, has suggested its use in peripheral amyloidosis, which was tested with positive results. A specific interaction with β-amyloid or α-synuclein oligomers, as well as tau aggregation has also been demonstrated. More recently, the action of doxycycline has been extended to its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant capacities. In particular, the anti-inflammatory activity of doxycycline may explain the drug 's efficacy in numerous experimental models where protein misfolding has been associated with neuroinflammation, including Huntington's and Parkinson' s diseases. Thus, the pleiotropic action of doxycycline appears to be an interesting tool for addressing progressive neuronal dysfunction in multifactorial neurodegenerative diseases. The application of precision medicine principles to doxycycline treatment represents the best strategy to determine its efficacy. These aspects are illustrated here concerning another pleiotropic tetracycline, minocycline."

    "abstract": "Aggregates of polyglutamine (polyQ) repeat extensions are known markers of several, predominantly inherited, neurodegenerative diseases. Removal of polyQ is essential for cellular proteostasis and macroautophagy/autophagy has been proposed to be an important tool in the clearance of polyQ aggregates. The mechanism of recognition and encapsulation of these aggregates within autophagosomes is largely unknown. A study described in this article employed <i>in situ</i> correlative cryo-electron tomography to visualize polyQ aggregates interacting with autophagic compartments. The tomograms revealed that only amorphous polyQ, but not fibrils, are engulfed by double-membrane structures and that SQSTM1/p62 is the receptor involved in recognition of polyQ during autophagy. Solidified amorphous polyQ and subsequent fibrils arrest the normal formation of autophagosomes and impair autophagy. Findings of the study described here have implications for therapies that rely on autophagy in targeting polyQ neurodegeneration.<b>Abbreviation:</b> cryo-CLEM, cryo-correlative light and electron microscopy; cryo-ET, cryo-electron tomography; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; HD, Huntington disease; HTT, huntingtin; polyQ, polyglutamine repeats."

    "abstract": "Gulf War Illness (GWI) is a multi-symptom chronic condition that affects Veterans who served in the 1990-1991 Gulf War (GW). To generate novel information about GWI pathogenesis, we used genome-wide data available from 33 523 Veterans of diverse ancestral backgrounds who served during the 1990-1991 Gulf War era (34% deployed). Polygenic score (PGS) analysis showed GWI pleiotropy for several traits with the strongest evidence for type-2 diabetes (T2D), anxiety, and depression. While T2D PGS was associated with higher GWI odds in GW Veterans, anxiety and depression PGSs were associated with higher odds of GWI in non-deployed GW-era Veterans. Seven independent variants were identified (P < 5 × 10-8). Two of them were supported by independent transcriptomic and phenome-wide analyses. Rs4675853 was associated with AGXT, MAB21L4, and ATG4Btranscriptomic regulation and with sex hormone-binding globulin levels. Rs138168412 was associated with AOPEPtranscriptomic regulation and with respiratory function and physical strength. The TWAS identified five additional loci such as CEMIPin the cerebellum and SNCGin the adrenal gland. The results provide a comprehensive assessment of the polygenic architecture of GWI research definitions, identifying mechanisms potentially relevant to the disease pathogenesis."

    "abstract": "Huntington disease's (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by the expansion of a polyglutamine region (PolyQ) within the huntingtin protein (HTT). Mutated huntingtin (mHTT) is cytotoxic, particularly for striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs), whose degeneration is the hallmark of HD. Autophagy inducers currently available promote the clearance of toxic proteins. However, due to their low selectivity and the possibility that prolonged autophagy hampers essential processes in unaffected cells, researchers have questioned their benefits in neurodegenerative diseases. Since MSNs express dopamine receptors D2 (DRD2) and D3 (DRD3) and DRD2/DRD3 agonists may activate autophagy, here, we explored how healthy and mHTT-challenged cells respond to prolonged DRD2/DRD3 agonist treatment. Autophagy activation and its effects on mHTT/polyQ clearance were studied in R6/1 mice (a genetic model of HD), their wild-type littermates, and <i>DRD2</i>- and <i>DRD3</i>-HEK cells expressing a pathogenic (Q74) and a non-pathogenic (Q23) polyQ fragment of mHTT treated with the DRD2/DRD3 agonist pramipexole. Two forms of DRD3-mediated autophagy were found: a transient mTORC1-dependent in WT mice and <i>Q23-DRD3</i>-HEK cells and a persistent AMPK-ULK1-activated in R6/1 mice and <i>Q74-DRD3</i>-HEK cells. This also promoted a robust clearance of soluble mHTT/polyQ and neuroprotection in striatal neurons and <i>DRD3</i>-HEK cells. The findings indicate that DRD3-induced autophagy may be a safe, disease-modifying intervention in HD patients."

    "abstract": "Frailty is an underappreciated but modifiable clinical syndrome, but little about how air quality improvements could influence frailty progression is known. Here, we utilized two Chinese cohorts with repeated follow-up visits to address this knowledge gap and explored the underlying DNA methylation mechanisms. We first conducted a multistate modeling analysis in the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Study (CLHLS), a nationwide cohort with 21,654 older adults who had participated in at least two survey waves. An interquartile range reduction in PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure increased the likelihood of improvement for frail/prefrail individuals by more than 50% while lowering their risks of worsening frailty or mortality. A quasi-experimental study within a CLHLS subcohort of 1816 adults, leveraging the implementation of China's Clean Air Act, further validated these findings. Additionally, in the Guangxi Eco-Environmental Health and Aging Study─a regional prospective cohort based in Guilin, China─we included 235 older adults with follow-up data and identified three frailty-related CpG sites that were associated with PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure. The CpG site cg25453797 mapped to the <i>PRKCE</i> gene was robustly associated with the change in frailty. These findings demonstrate that air quality improvement benefits older adults by alleviating the frailty burden. DNA methylation may serve as a potential biomarker to capture the health benefits of environmental policy interventions."

Measured by magnetoencephalography (MEG), the modulation of motor-related oscillations via NMT is associated with restorative motor training. In HD, the impact of NMT on fine motor function and associated neurophysiology have yet to be explored.ObjectiveConduct a proof-of-concept study to determine the feasibility of NMT and MEG evaluation in people with HD.MethodsThree participants with HD and impaired fine motor skills underwent a five-week NMT intervention. Pre- and post-intervention assessments included the Unified HD Rating Scale, the Grooved Pegboard Test, and MEG recording during a cued finger-tapping task.ResultsThere was 100% adherence to the pre and post visit assessments and MEG, and 93% adherence to the NMT intervention. A visual increase in evoked beta/gamma power at cue onset along with an earlier evoked beta response at 500-800 msec post cue were observed in the neuromagnetic data after NMT.ConclusionNMT-based fine motor rehabilitation, and its evaluation with neurophysiological studies, are feasible in HD. More work is needed to determine if this intervention holds potential to influence functional change or spectral patterns of motor cortical activity."

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis pose significant challenges due to their complex pathophysiology and lack of effective treatments. Green tea, rich in the epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) polyphenolic component, has demonstrated potential as a neuroprotective agent with numerous medicinal applications. EGCG effectively reduces tau and Aβ aggregation in ND models, promotes autophagy, and targets key signaling pathways like Nrf2-ARE, NF-κB, and MAPK. This review explores the molecular processes that underlie EGCG's neuroprotective properties, including its ability to regulate mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and protein misfolding. Clinical research indicates that EGCG may enhance cognitive and motor abilities, potentially inhibiting disease progression despite absorption and dose optimization limitations. The substance has been proven to slow the amyloidogenic process, prevent protein aggregation, decrease amyloid cytotoxicity, inhibit fibrillogenesis, and restructure fibrils for synergistic therapeutic effects. The review highlights the potential of EGCG as a natural, multi-targeted strategy for NDs but emphasizes the need for further clinical trials to enhance its therapeutic efficacy."

    "abstract": "The mechanisms underlying detrimental effects of mutant Huntingtin on striatal dysfunction in Huntington's disease (HD) are not well understood. Although retinoic acid receptor beta (RARβ) emerged recently as one of the top regulators of transcriptionally downregulated genes in the striatum of HD patients and mouse models, its involvement in disease progression remains elusive. Here we challenged functional relevance of RARβ dysregulation in HD onset and progression. Using a series of genetic mouse models, we investigated whether genetically reduced Rarβ expression synergizes with disease- causing mutant huntingtin (mHTT) fragment in R6/1 mice to accelerate HD-like behavioral, cellular and molecular striatal deregulations. We report that genetically compromised Rarβ signaling accelerates onset of motor abnormalities in the R6/1 HD mouse model. Transcriptional profiling revealed that downregulation of Rarβ expression in Rarβ<sup>+/-</sup>; R6/1 mice also accelerates transcriptional signature of disease progression and aging by emergence of a cluster of upregulated genes related to cell-cycle, stem cell maintenance and telencephalon development, contributing thereby to degradation of striatal cell-identity. Reactivation of proliferative activity in the neurogenic niche and development-related transcriptional programs in the striatum prompt an attempt of lineage infidelity in HD striatum which may lead as a consequence to disease-driving energy crisis, as suggested by downregulation of oxidative phosphorylation genes, a well-accepted correlate of HD physiopathology, and a metabolic condition required for maintenance of proliferative activity and differentiation but not compatible with high energetic demand of differentiated and active neurons. Overall, our data indicate that RARβ delays disease progression, perhaps by delaying aging process."

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), like Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), present an increasingly significant global health burden, primarily due to the lack of effective early diagnostic tools and treatments. Exosomes-nano-sized extracellular vesicles secreted by nearly all cell types-have emerged as promising candidates for both biomarkers and therapeutic agents in NDs. This review examines the biogenesis, molecular composition, and diverse functions of exosomes in NDs. Exosomes play a crucial role in mediating intercellular communication. They are capable of reflecting the biochemical state of their parent cells and have the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). In doing so, they facilitate the propagation of pathological proteins, such as amyloid-beta (Aβ), tau, and alpha-synuclein (α-syn), while also enabling the targeted delivery of neuroprotective compounds. Recent advancements in exosome isolation and engineering have opened up new possibilities for diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. These range from the discovery of non-invasive biomarkers to innovative approaches in gene therapy and drug delivery systems. However, challenges related to standardization, safety, and long-term effects must be addressed before exosomes can be translated into clinical applications. This review highlights both the promising potential and the obstacles that must be overcome to leverage exosomes in the treatment of NDs and the transformation of personalized medicine."

    "abstract": "Aging is accompanied by widespread DNA methylation changes across the genome. While age-related methylation studies typically focus on individual CpGs, cluster analysis provides more robust data and improved interpretation. We characterized age-associated CpG-cluster methylation changes in mouse spleens, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and livers. We identified a novel signature termed blanket methylations (BMs), fully methylated CpG clusters absent in young tissues but appearing in aged tissues. BM formation was locus- and cell-dependent, with minimal overlap among tissues. Statistical analysis, heterogeneity assessment, and random modeling demonstrated that BMs arise through nonrandom mechanisms and correlate with accelerated aging. Notably, BMs appeared in chronologically young mice with progeroid or disease-driven aging, including in 4-month-old Zmpste24-/- (lifespan ∼5 months) and 3-month-old Huntington's disease model mice (lifespan ∼4 months). The detection of BMs in purified CD4+ T cells demonstrated that their occurrence is intrinsic to aging cells rather than a result of infiltration from other tissues. Further investigation revealed age-related downregulation of zinc-finger-CxxC-domain genes, including Tet1 and Tet3, which protect CpG islands from methylation. Importantly, TET1 or TET3 depletion induced BM formation, linking their loss to age-associated methylation drift. These findings establish BMs as a robust marker of epigenomic aging, providing insight into age-related methylation changes."

The research addresses a critical gap in understanding whether counseling, when received concurrently with buprenorphine, can enhance patient outcomes. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using data from the Massachusetts Department of Public Health's Public Health Data Warehouse (PHD). The study included patients who initiated buprenorphine treatment between January 2015 and December 2019. Investigators measured outcomes including medication adherence, treatment discontinuation, and opioid-related overdose over a 12-month period. We evaluated the effectiveness of counseling based on whether patients attended a minimum of three sessions in the first three months of buprenorphine treatment. We employed multivariate logistic regression and propensity score matching to analyze the data. The study sample comprised 32,688 patients with 8871 (27 %) receiving counseling concomitantly with buprenorphine. Results from the regression analyses showed that counseling was associated with 17 % lower likelihood of poor medication continuity (OR = 0.83, 95 % CI = 0.78-0.87) and 21 % lower likelihood of treatment discontinuation (OR = 0.79, 95 % CI = 0.75-0.83). Counseling was not associated with the odds of opioid-related overdose. Additional results from sensitivity analyses pointed to a dose-response relationship for counseling within the parameters studied. Findings suggest that counseling, when combined with buprenorphine treatment for OUD is associated with better patient outcomes in terms of medication continuity and treatment retention. However, the impact of counseling on opioid-related overdose risk was inconclusive, highlighting the need for further research to understand its role in overdose prevention."

    "abstract": "Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists (GRA) belong to a class of compounds that reduce blood glucose and energy intake by simulating actions of endogenous incretin hormone GLP-1 after it is released by the gut following food consumption. They are used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obesity and have systemic effects on various organs, including the brain, liver, pancreas, heart, and the gut. Patients with T2DM have a higher risk of developing neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Huntington's disease (HD), accompanied by more severe motor deficits and faster disease progression, suggesting dysregulation of insulin signaling in these diseases. Experimental studies have shown that GRA have protective effects to modulate neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial and autophagic functions, and protein misfolding. Hence the compounds have generated enormous interest as novel therapeutic agents against NDs. To date, clinical trials have shown that three GRA, exenatide, liraglutide and lixisenatide can improve motor deficits as an add-on therapy in PD patients and liraglutide can improve cognitive function in AD patients. The neuroprotective effects of these and other GRA, such as PT320 (a sustained-released exenatide) and semaglutide, are still under investigation. The dual GLP-1/gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) receptor agonists have been demonstrated to have beneficial effects in AD and PD mice models. Overall, GRA are highly promising novel drugs, but future clinical studies should identify which subsets of patients should be targeted as potential candidates for their symptomatic and/or neuroprotective benefits, investigate whether combinations with other classes of drugs can further augment their efficacy, and evaluate their long-term disease-modifying and adverse effects."

These compounds hold promise for treating neurodegenerative disorders, including branaplam for lowering huntingtin levels in Huntington's disease. However, the VIBRANT-HD trial was terminated due to the emergence of peripheral neuropathy. Here, we describe the complex mechanism whereby branaplam activates p53, induces nucleolar stress in human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived motor neurons (iPSC-MN), and thereby enhanced expression of the neurotoxic p53-target gene BBC3. On the cellular level, branaplam disrupts neurite integrity, reflected by elevated neurofilament light chain levels. These findings illustrate the complex pharmacology of RNA splicing modulators with a small therapeutic window between lowering huntingtin levels and the clinically relevant off-target effect of neuropathy. Comprehensive toxicological screening in human stem cell models can complement pre-clinical testing before advancing RNA-targeting drugs to clinical trials."

However, such symptom measurement currently requires completion of multiple, often lengthy, PROMs, which may lead to questionnaire fatigue, lower levels of completion, and missing data. Moreover, many CKD-specific PROMs lack evidence of important measurement properties and few were developed using contemporary psychometric methods. The study objective was to develop and validate a short-form kidney symptom burden questionnaire (KSB-Q). A cross-sectional item pool survey was distributed to adults (≥18 years) with CKD stages 3-5 [including individuals not receiving kidney replacement therapy (KRT), those receiving dialysis and those with a functioning kidney transplant] in England (Birmingham, London, Sheffield, and Nottingham) from March to September 2022. Rasch measurement was used to assess the psychometric properties of the item pool. Cognitive debriefing interviews were conducted to evaluate content validity. In total, 419/1464 participants responded (29% response rate), with 28% receiving dialysis and 30% in receipt of a kidney transplant. Rasch analysis indicated that nine items, one for each of nine symptom domains (fatigue, pain, memory/concentration, poor sleep, skin problems, gastrointestinal problems, dizziness, restless legs, and shortness of breath), formed a PROM with strong psychometric properties (including statistically acceptable reliability, test-retest reliability, and validity). Cognitive debriefing and survey responses confirmed content validity encompassing relevance, comprehensiveness, and clarity. The KSB-Q is a nine-item PROM measuring somatic symptoms. The KSB-Q demonstrates strong psychometric properties in patients with CKD stages 3-5, including those not receiving KRT, individuals receiving dialysis, and those with a functioning kidney transplant."

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and Huntington's disease (HD) are characterized by progressive neuronal damage, protein aggregation, and chronic inflammation, leading to cognitive and motor impairments. Despite symptomatic relief from current therapies, disease-modifying treatments targeting the core molecular mechanism are still lacking. RNA-based therapies offer a promising approach to treating neurodegenerative disease by targeting molecular mechanisms such as gene expression, protein synthesis, and neuroinflammation. Therapeutic strategies include Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs), RNA interference (RNAi), small interfering RNA (siRNA) and short hairpin RNA (shRNA), messenger RNA (mRNA) therapies, and microRNA (miRNA)-based interventions. These therapies aim to decrease toxic protein accumulation, restore deficient proteins, and modulate inflammatory responses in conditions like AD, PD, and HD. Unlike conventional treatments that primarily manage symptoms, RNA-based therapies have the potential to modify disease progression by addressing its root causes. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of current RNA-based therapeutic strategies for neurodegenerative diseases, discussing their mechanism of action, preclinical and clinical advancement. It further explores innovative solutions, including nanocarrier-mediated delivery, chemical modifications to enhance RNA stability, and personalized medicine approaches guided by genetic profiling that are being developed to overcome these barriers.

    "abstract": "Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expansion of CAG repeats in exon 1 of the huntingtin (HTT) gene, resulting in a mutant HTT (mHTT) protein. Although mHTT is expressed in all tissues, it significantly affects medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the striatum, resulting in their loss and the subsequent motor function impairment in HD. While HD symptoms typically emerge in midlife, disrupted MSN neurodevelopment is important. To explore the effects of mHTT on MSN development, we differentiated HD-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) and isogenic controls into neuronal stem cells, and then generated a developing MSN population encompassing early, intermediate progenitors, and nascent MSNs. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that the developmental trajectory of MSNs in our model closely emulated the trajectory of human fetal striatal neurons. However, in the HD MSN cultures, several crucial genes required for proper MSN maturation were downregulated, including members of the DLX family of transcription factors. Our analysis also uncovered a progressive dysregulation of multiple HD-related pathways as MSNs developed, including the NRF2-mediated oxidative stress response and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling. Using the transcriptional profile of developing HD MSNs, we searched the L1000 dataset for small molecules that induce the opposite gene expression pattern. We pinpointed numerous small molecules with known benefits in HD models and previously untested novel molecules. A top candidate, Cerulenin, partially restored the DARPP-32 levels and electrical activity in HD MSNs, and also modulated genes involved in multiple HD-related pathways."

Minority ethnic communities affected by neurodegenerative conditions often face health and social care disparities. This can lead to delayed diagnosis and poor health outcomes. Interventions that provide relevant, accessible information about neurodegenerative conditions may help reduce disparities in care access. There is limited knowledge about the methods used to culturally tailor interventions for minority ethnic communities and their efficacy. Eligible sources will include interventions specifically tailored for South Asian and Black communities, living with dementia, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, or motor neurone disease. Interventions must be conducted in countries that are member states of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development where these two groups constitute minority populations and are likely to face inequalities in care access. A scoping review guided by the Joanna Briggs Institute Manual for Evidence Synthesis will be conducted. Searches of Medline (EBSCO), APA PsycInfo (EBSCO), and EMBASE (Elsevier) will be conducted. Study selection will be based on 100% agreement between two reviewers. Data will be extracted, charted, and summarised narratively followed by consultation with stakeholders. This review will identify culturally sensitive strategies for raising awareness and reducing the stigma associated with neurodegenerative conditions among South Asian and Black communities within the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries. By utilising these inclusive approaches, communities may feel more empowered to seek a diagnosis for symptoms and live better with the condition.

However, the effect of acute DA release on mood, the localization of this process, and the phenotypic differences in patients with ICB remain unknown. We applied a placebo-controlled dextro-amphetamine (dAMPH) study in 20 PD patients: 10 with ICBs (PD-ICB) and 10 without (PD-C). Subjective mood experiences were measured with well-described self-reported measures including the Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS), Drug Effects Questionnaire (DEQ), and Amphetamine Interview Rating Scale (AIRS). D2-like receptor availability was measured as non-displaceable binding potential (BP<sub>ND</sub>) using PET imaging with the high-affinity D2/3 receptor ligand [<sup>18</sup>F]-fallypride. Among all the subjects, dAMPH increased the PANAS positive, DEQ feel, DEQ high, and AIRS total scores. Increases in the PANAS positive and AIRS total scores were greater in the PD-ICB cohort. A mixed-effects model correlated these questionnaire changes with dAMPH-induced reductions in BP<sub>ND</sub> in the ventral striatum (VS), caudate, amygdala, and caudo-medial orbitofrontal cortex. The baseline caudate, VS, and amygdala BP<sub>ND</sub> positively correlated with lower on-dAMPH PANAS positive scores. Elevated mood symptoms of acute dAMPH administration in PD are linked to DA release in the mesocorticolimbic regions. Distinctions in behavioral effects among PD-ICB subjects emphasize that dysregulated striatal and extra-striatal DA-ergic networks alter mood responses to stimulated DA release and may also contribute to behavioral changes resulting from DA-targeting therapies in PD."

    "abstract": "Over the past two decades, significant advancements have been made in the induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology. These developments have enabled the broader application of iPSCs in neuroscience, improved our understanding of disease pathogenesis, and advanced the investigation of therapeutic targets and methods. Specifically, optimizations in reprogramming protocols, coupled with improved neuronal differentiation and maturation techniques, have greatly facilitated the generation of iPSC-derived neural cells. The integration of the cerebral organoid technology and CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing has further propelled the application of iPSCs in neurodegenerative diseases to a new stage. Patient-derived or CRISPR-edited cerebral neurons and organoids now serve as ideal disease models, contributing to our understanding of disease pathophysiology and identifying novel therapeutic targets and candidates. In this review, we examine the development of iPSC-based models in neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease."

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple sclerosis (MS), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Huntington's disease (HD), represent a significant challenge to global health due to their progressive nature and the absence of curative treatments. These disorders are characterized by oxidative stress, protein misfolding, and neuroinflammation, which collectively contribute to neuronal damage and death. Recent advancements in nanotechnology have introduced nanozymes-engineered nanomaterials that mimic enzyme-like activities-as promising therapeutic agents. This review explores the multifaceted roles of nanozymes in combating oxidative stress and inflammation in neurodegenerative conditions. By harnessing their potent antioxidant properties, nanozymes can effectively scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS) and restore redox balance, thereby protecting neuronal function. Their ability to modify surface properties enhances targeted delivery and biocompatibility, making them suitable for various biomedical applications. In this review, we highlight recent findings on the design, functionality, and therapeutic potential of nanozymes, emphasizing their dual role in addressing oxidative stress and pathological features such as protein aggregation. This synthesis of current research underscores the innovative potential of nanozymes as a proactive therapeutic strategy to halt disease progression and improve patient outcomes in neurodegenerative disorders."

    "title": "Interventionally targeting somatic CAG expansions can be a rapid disease-modifying therapeutic avenue: Preclinical evidence.",
    "abstract": "Huntington disease (HD) is caused by inherited CAG expansions, which continue expanding somatically in affected brain regions to hasten disease onset and progression. Therapeutically diminishing somatic expansions is expected to be clinically beneficial. However, it is not known if interventionally modifying somatic CAG expansions will actually modify <i>in vivo</i> clinically-relevant phenotypes, what the therapeutic window is, or which phenotypes will be altered. Here we show that acute (6-week) delivery of the contraction-inducing slipped-CAG DNA ligand naphthyridine-azaquinolone to young (4-week-old) (CAG)120 HD mice, induces contractions throughout brain regions, improves motor function (locomotion, balance, coordination, muscle strength), molecular disease landmarks (mHTT aggregates, nuclear envelope morphology, nucleocytoplasmic mRNA transport, transcriptomic dysregulation, neuroinflammation), and neurodegeneration. Beneficial effects of modifying somatic expansions were also evident in muscle and blood, where blood CAG instability correlated with brain instability and blood serum had diminished levels of neurofilament light (a biomarker for neurodegeneration) - offering blood as having elements of target engagement and efficacy. These data support that targeting somatic repeat expansions can be a rapid disease-modifying therapeutic avenue for HD and possibly other repeat expansion diseases. Our findings support an etiologic pathway interconnected to somatic CAG expansions that will inform the design of clinical trials expecting clinical benefit by modulating somatic expansions."

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's disease, and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis) are major health threats for the aging population and their prevalences continue to rise with the increasing of life expectancy. Although progress has been made, there is still a lack of effective cures to date, and an in-depth understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms of these neurodegenerative diseases is imperative for drug development. Protein phosphorylation, regulated by protein kinases and protein phosphatases, participates in most cellular events, whereas aberrant phosphorylation manifests as a main cause of diseases. As evidenced by pharmacological and pathological studies, protein kinases are proven to be promising therapeutic targets for various diseases, such as cancers, central nervous system disorders, and cardiovascular diseases. The mechanisms of protein phosphatases in pathophysiology have been extensively reviewed, but a systematic summary of the role of protein kinases in the nervous system is lacking. Here, we focus on the involvement of protein kinases in neurodegenerative diseases, by summarizing the current knowledge on the major kinases and related regulatory signal transduction pathways implicated in diseases. We further discuss the role and complexity of kinase-kinase networks in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, illustrate the advances of clinical applications of protein kinase inhibitors or novel kinase-targeted therapeutic strategies (such as antisense oligonucleotides and gene therapy) for effective prevention and early intervention."

    "abstract": "Individuals with neurodegenerative conditions, such as Parkinson's, Huntington's, Dementia, and Multiple Sclerosis, often experience significant social isolation due to physical and cognitive limitations that hinder social participation. Social isolation can lead to loneliness and reduced quality of life. This scoping review aimed to map interventions designed to enhance social connectedness and mitigate these effects. Following Arksey and O'Malley's scoping review framework, key databases were searched. Inclusion criteria focused on interventions fostering social participation in adults with neurodegenerative conditions. Themes were identified through a narrative synthesis approach. A total of 1,038 articles were screened, with 37 meeting the inclusion criteria. Most interventions involved in-person group activities, with digital interventions representing a smaller area. The synthesis revealed three themes: intervention details, theoretical frameworks, and evaluations. These themes highlighted key components and theoretical foundations that informed interventions but also identified implementation challenges with accessibility and inclusivity for individuals with varied needs. The findings underscore the need for diverse, accessible interventions to foster social connectedness for individuals with neurodegenerative conditions. Future research should focus on refining intervention design to improve inclusivity, addressing barriers to enhance participation in both in-person and digital formats."

    "title": "Reduced Palmitoylation of SQSTM1/p62 in Huntington Disease Is Associated With Impaired Autophagy.",
    "abstract": "Disruption of autophagy has emerged as a common feature in many neurodegenerative diseases. Autophagy is a membrane-dependent pathway that requires many key regulators to quickly localize on and off membranes during induction, promoting membrane fusion. Previously, our bioinformatic approaches have shown that autophagy and Huntington disease (HD) are enriched in palmitoylated proteins. Palmitoylation involves the reversible addition of long-chain fatty acids to promote membrane binding. Herein, we show that inhibition of palmitoylation regulates the abundance of several key regulators of autophagy and leads to a partial block of autophagic flux. We confirm that the autophagy receptor SQSTM1/p62 (sequestosome 1) is palmitoylated and directed to the lysosome. Importantly, we report that SQSTM1 palmitoylation is significantly reduced in HD patient and mouse model brains. This finding reveals a novel mechanism contributing to the generation of empty autophagosomes previously seen in HD models and patient-derived cells."

    "title": "Characterizing Patient-Reported Fatigue Using Electronic Diaries in Neurodegenerative and Immune-Mediated Inflammatory Diseases: Observational Study.",
    "abstract": "Fatigue is a prevalent and debilitating symptom in many chronic conditions, including immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs) and neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs). Fatigue often fluctuates significantly within and between days, yet traditional patient-reported outcomes (PROs) typically rely on recall periods of a week or more, potentially missing these short-term variations. The development of digital tools, such as electronic diaries (eDiaries), offers a unique opportunity to collect granular, real-time data. However, the feasibility, adherence, and comparability of eDiary-based assessments to established PROs require further investigation. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of using a high-frequency eDiary to capture intraday variability in fatigue and to compare eDiary data with scores obtained from the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F), a validated weekly recall PRO. Data were collected from 159 participants enrolled in the IDEA-FAST (Identifying Digital Endpoints to Assess Fatigue, Sleep and Activities in Daily Living in Neurodegenerative Disorders and Immune-Mediated Inflammatory Diseases) feasibility study; a 4-week prospective observational study conducted at 4 European centers. Participants included individuals with NDDs (n=39), IMIDs (n=78), and healthy volunteers (n=42). Participants used an eDiary to report their physical and mental fatigue levels up to 4 times daily on a 7-point Likert scale (0=low and 6=high). Adherence was calculated as the proportion of completed eDiary entries relative to the total expected entries. Correlations between averaged eDiary scores and weekly FACIT-F scores were analyzed. Adherence to the eDiary protocol was 5505/8880 (61.99%) overall, varying by cohort, with the highest adherence (1117/1200, 93.07%) observed in the primary Sjögren syndrome cohort and the lowest adherence in the Parkinson disease (410/960, 42.7%) and Huntington disease (320/720, 44.4%) cohorts. The average adherence was 430/1680 (43.45%) in the NDD cohorts and 3367/4560 (73.84%) in the IMID cohorts. Fatigue levels showed clear diurnal variation, with significantly higher fatigue reported in the evening compared to the morning (P<.001). A moderate correlation (Spearman=0.46, P<.001) was observed between eDiary fatigue scores and FACIT-F scores, with stronger cohort-specific associations for certain FACIT-F items. These results indicate that eDiaries provide complementary insights to weekly PROs by capturing intraday fluctuations in fatigue. This study demonstrates the feasibility, acceptability, and validity of using high-frequency eDiaries to assess fatigue in chronic conditions. By effectively detecting intra- and interday fatigue variations, eDiaries complement traditional PROs such as FACIT-F, offering a more nuanced understanding of fatigue patterns. Future research should explore optimized eDiary protocols to balance participant burden with data granularity."

    "abstract": "This review synthesizes recent literature, primarily from the last 5 years, to highlight the impact of innovative technologies and analytical approaches on the application of positron emission tomography (PET) in movement disorders. PET remains a cornerstone for investigating these conditions, with recent advancements enhancing our understanding of disease pathophysiology and progression. Established findings, such as the ability of [<sup>18</sup>F]-fluorodeoxyglucose PET (18F-FDG PET) to differentiate Parkinson's disease (PD) from atypical parkinsonian syndromes based on characteristic metabolic patterns, have been consistently validated. PD typically presents with relative hypermetabolism in the basal ganglia, thalamus and cerebellum, while atypical parkinsonisms exhibit more widespread subcortical hypometabolism. Technological innovations, particularly in quantification methods and metabolic connectivity analysis, have improved diagnostic precision and provided deeper insights into disease mechanisms. Dopaminergic PET imaging, crucial for assessing presynaptic and postsynaptic dysfunction, has also benefited from these advances. The field is further evolving with the development of novel tracers targeting pathological hallmarks, such as alpha-synuclein in PD and multiple system atrophy (MSA), tau in progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and cortico-basal degeneration (CBD), and tracers for neuroinflammation, microglial activation, and neurotransmitter systems like serotonin and acetylcholine. While PET is not yet routinely used for the clinical assessment of Huntington's disease or ataxia, research applications are expanding, driven by the potential of these new tracers and analytical techniques. These advancements not only reinforce existing knowledge but also open new avenues for enhancing the understanding and management of movement disorders."

    "abstract": "[<sup>18</sup>F]Fallypride PET has been used to study D2/3 receptor occupancy and density in neuropsychiatric disorders including Huntington's disease (HD) and aging in humans. Nevertheless, the various synthetic methods including those provided by commercial synthesizers for [<sup>18</sup>F]fallypride exhibit a disadvantage concerning the necessity of using a HPLC purification step, which causes difficulties in the automation, leads to long synthesis times and moderate yields. Therefore utilizing the purification step by SPE cartridges is considered highly desirable for future commercialization of radiopharmaceutical cassettes. In our lab we have developed a simplified reliable automatic Radiosynthesis of [<sup>18</sup>F]fallypride by using SPE cartridges for the purification step without the need of HPLC. A simplified Radiosynthesis of [<sup>18</sup>F]fallypride has been developed without the use of HPLC for both a commercial cassette based synthesis system (AllinOne (AiO) system, Trasis, Belgium) and a research synthesis module with fixed tubing (RNplus, Synthra, Germany). The cleaning step involves a serial combination of several SPE cartridges. The synthesis time was shortened by 44% compared to synthesis using HPLC. At the same time the not decay corrected yield increases from 44 to 59% by using TBAHCO<sub>3</sub> as phase transfer catalysts and from 17 to 31% for the synthesis with K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>/Kryptofix-[2.2.2] compared to synthesis using HPLC. The Radiochemical purity was always > 98% and all quality control parameters (e.g. sterility, endotoxin, stability and Radiochemical purity) conformed with requirements of the European Pharmacopoeia. A GMP compliant automatic synthesis of [<sup>18</sup>F]fallypride including purification using simple solid phase extraction cartridges instead of HPLC was developed and evaluated. The implementation of the simplified synthesis in both used commercial modules allows efficient and reproducible Radiosynthesis of [<sup>18</sup>F]fallypride and leads to short synthesis times and high radiochemical yields with high radiochemical purity."

    "abstract": "Huntington's disease (HD) is a hereditary neurodegenerative condition caused by a CAG repeat expansion mutation in the gene encoding the huntingtin (HTT) protein. The accumulation of HTT inclusion bodies is a pathological hallmark of HD and a common target for therapeutic strategies. However, the limited efficacy of treatments targeting the HTT protein highlights the need for a better understanding of the role of HTT inclusion bodies in HD pathogenesis. This study examined the heterogeneity of HTT inclusion body composition by co-labelling with three HTT epitope-specific antibodies to characterize HTT inclusion body 'immunophenotype'. We then characterized the size and sub-cellular location of HTT inclusions with distinct immunophenotypes. Using multiplex immunohistochemistry, we also examined the ubiquitination profile of each immunophenotype. Our findings demonstrate that HTT inclusions have a range of immunophenotypes, with some labelled by only one of the three antibodies and others exhibiting co-labelling by several antibodies, thus demonstrating the heterogeneity in inclusion composition and structure. We outline evidence that inclusion bodies exclusively labelled with the EM48 antibody are small, non-nuclear, and more abundant in HD cases with increased CAG repeat length, higher Vonsattel grade, and earlier age of onset. We also find that HTT inclusion bodies labelled by multiple antibodies are more likely to be ubiquitinated, predominantly by K63- rather than K48-linked ubiquitin, suggesting preferential degradation by autophagy. Lastly, we show that ubiquitinated HTT inclusion bodies are more highly immunoreactive for ubiquilin 2 than p62. Our findings highlight the need for multiple antibodies to capture the full spectrum of HTT pathology in HD and imply that future studies should consider the diversity of inclusion body composition and structure when correlating pathology formation to neurodegeneration, clinical symptoms, or disease severity."

This study aimed to quantify longitudinal changes in Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) scores and evaluate their susceptibility to placebo response, enhancing our understanding of disease progression and ability to optimize future trials. We used data from the Enroll-HD natural history study (NCT01574053) and the GENERATION HD1 phase 3 clinical trial (NCT03761849) to model disease progression and placebo response for UHDRS scores, which are commonly used to evaluate disease progression in clinical trials. We included 8,071 Enroll-HD participants (mean baseline age: 51.4 years, 51.5% female) to develop a natural history progression model using baseline characteristics as predictive covariates. This model was then used to predict natural history progression of 260 participants from the GENERATION HD1 placebo arm (mean baseline age: 48.7 years, 43.5% female).The progression measured by Total Functional Capacity (TFC) in the GENERATION HD1 placebo arm aligned with predicted natural history (within 95% CI), indicating no significant placebo response. However, significant improvements (outside the 95% CI of the model) were observed after baseline for Total Motor Score (TMS), Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) score, and Stroop Word Reading (SWR) score. The improvement in TMS persisted until the end of the dosing period (week 69), converging to natural history predictions at subsequent follow-up visits (weeks 85 and 101), suggesting a placebo effect. By contrast, cognitive scores (SDMT and SWR) showed sustained significant improvement (outside the 95% CI) up to the final follow-up visit at week 101, likely due to practice effects from the more frequent testing schedule in GENERATION HD1 compared with the annual assessments in Enroll-HD. Consequently, the composite UHDRS (cUHDRS) score, a linear combination of TFC, TMS, SDMT, and SWR, is influenced by both placebo and practice effects. Our results suggest that clinical scores in Huntington disease trials are susceptible to long-term placebo responses. These effects should be considered in future trial designs, especially when comparing trial data with natural history studies. Although based on the largest Huntington's trial, our results rely on limited placebo data and may not generalize to other trials with different populations, treatments, and designs."

    "abstract": "Emerging evidence suggests that the gut microbiota is closely associated with the pathological manifestations of multiple neurodegenerative diseases via the gut-brain axis, which refers to the crosstalk between the gut and the central nervous system. More importantly, mitochondria have been considered prominent mediators of the interplay between the gut microbiota and the brain. Intestinal microbes may modulate mitochondrial function in the central nervous system to affect the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. Mitochondria are essential for meeting the host's substantial neuronal metabolic demands, maintaining excitability, and facilitating synaptic transmission. Dysfunctional mitochondria are considered critical hallmarks of various neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, this review provides novel insights into the intricate roles of gut microbiota-mitochondrial crosstalk in the underlying mechanisms during the progression of neurodegeneration, as well as the existing potential therapeutic strategies for neurodegenerative disorders. These suggest intestinal microbiota-mitochondrial interaction play a crucial role in the occurrence and development of neurodegenerative diseases, and targeting this interaction may be a promising therapeutic approach to neurodegenerative diseases. However, this review found that there was relatively little research on the effect of this crosstalk on other neurodegenerative diseases, such as Huntington's disease and Multiple sclerosis, and the potential therapeutic strategies were translated into clinical trials, which face many challenges in developing personalized treatment plans based on the unique gut microbiota of different individuals."

    "title": "Mitochondrial stress disassembles nuclear architecture through proteolytic activation of PKCδ and Lamin B1 phosphorylation in neuronal cells: implications for pathogenesis of age-related neurodegenerative diseases.",
    "abstract": "Mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress are central to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's, Alzheimer's and Huntington's diseases. Neurons, particularly dopaminergic (DAergic) ones, are highly vulnerable to mitochondrial stress; however, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying this vulnerability remain poorly understood. Previously, we demonstrated that protein kinase C delta (PKCδ) is highly expressed in DAergic neurons and mediates apoptotic cell death during neurotoxic stress via caspase-3-mediated proteolytic activation. Herein, we further uncovered a key downstream molecular event of PKCδ signaling following mitochondrial dysfunction that governs neuronal cell death by dissembling nuclear architecture. Exposing N27 DAergic cells to the mitochondrial complex-1 inhibitor tebufenpyrad (Tebu) induced PKCδ phosphorylation at the T505 activation loop accompanied by caspase-3-dependent proteolytic activation. High-resolution 3D confocal microscopy revealed that proteolytically activated cleaved PKCδ translocates to the nucleus, colocalizing with Lamin B1. Electron microscopy also visualized nuclear membrane damage in Tebu-treated N27 cells. <i>In silico</i> analyses identified threonine site on Lamin B1 (T575) as a phosphorylation site of PKCδ. Interestingly, N27 DAergic cells stably expressing a PKCδ cleavage-resistant mutant failed to induce nuclear damage, PKCδ activation, and Lamin B1 phosphorylation. Furthermore, CRISPR/Cas9-based stable knockdown of PKCδ greatly attenuated Tebu-induced Lamin B1 phosphorylation. Also, studies using the Lamin B1<sup>T575G</sup> phosphorylation mutant and PKCδ-ΔNLS-overexpressing N27 cells showed that PKCδ activation and translocation to the nuclear membrane are essential for phosphorylating Lamin B1 at T575 to induce nuclear membrane damage during Tebu insult. Additionally, Tebu failed to induce Lamin B1 damage and Lamin B1 phosphorylation in organotypic midbrain slices cultured from PKCδ<sup>-/-</sup> mouse pups. Postmortem analyses of PD brains revealed significantly higher PKCδ activation, Lamin B1 phosphorylation, and Lamin B1 loss in nigral DAergic neurons compared to age-matched healthy controls, demonstrating the translational relevance of these findings. Collectively, our data reveal that PKCδ functions as a Lamin B1 kinase to disassemble the nuclear membrane during mitochondrial stress-induced neuronal death. This mechanistic insight may have important implications for the etiology of age-related neurodegenerative diseases resulting from mitochondrial dysfunction as well as for the development of novel treatment strategies."

    "abstract": "Huntington's disease (HD) is a monogenic neurodegenerative disorder typically characterized by chorea, a hyperkinetic motor feature. Historical data suggest that hypokinetic features, like rigidity and bradykinesia, become more prominent in later stages of HD. No evidence-based analysis has confirmed this observation. Additionally, several motor features of the disease are not clearly defined as hypokinetic or hyperkinetic. This study aimed to 1) elucidate the trajectory of hyperkinetic and hypokinetic features across the disease course and 2) to classify vague motor features as following a hyperkinetic or hypokinetic trajectory. Data from 13,475 motor-manifest HD patients from the Enroll-HD platform were analyzed. Linear mixed-effects models were constructed for each of the 31 Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) motor subscales, with disease burden as the primary predictor. The models were used to generate the trajectories of features known to represent hyperkinesis and hypokinesis, with the same being done for vague subscales. Dynamic time warping (DTW) was then used to classify said subscales as having a hyperkinetic or hypokinetic trajectory. Hyperkinetic features rise initially and diminish in middle disease, while hypokinetic features continually increase across the disease course. All non-choreiform features demonstrated a hypokinetic-like trajectory. HD is generally considered a hyperkinetic movement disorder, but the middle and late stages of the disease are predominated by hypokinesis. These findings suggest that hypokinetic features may be a larger contributor to the overall motor burden of HD. This has significant implications for clinical trial design, motor phenotype clustering, and pharmacotherapy."

    "abstract": "The cure rate for chronic neurodegenerative diseases remains low, creating an urgent need for improved intervention methods. Recent studies have shown that enhancing mitochondrial function can mitigate the effects of these diseases. This paper comprehensively reviews the relationship between mitochondrial dysfunction and chronic neurodegenerative diseases, aiming to uncover the potential use of targeted mitochondrial interventions as viable therapeutic options. We detail five targeted mitochondrial intervention strategies for chronic neurodegenerative diseases that act by promoting mitophagy, inhibiting mitochondrial fission, enhancing mitochondrial biogenesis, applying mitochondria-targeting antioxidants, and transplanting mitochondria. Each method has unique advantages and potential limitations, making them suitable for various therapeutic situations. Therapies that promote mitophagy or inhibit mitochondrial fission could be particularly effective in slowing disease progression, especially in the early stages. In contrast, those that enhance mitochondrial biogenesis and apply mitochondria-targeting antioxidants may offer great benefits during the middle stages of the disease by improving cellular antioxidant capacity and energy metabolism. Mitochondrial transplantation, while still experimental, holds great promise for restoring the function of damaged cells. Future research should focus on exploring the mechanisms and effects of these intervention strategies, particularly regarding their safety and efficacy in clinical settings. Additionally, the development of innovative mitochondria-targeting approaches, such as gene editing and nanotechnology, may provide new solutions for treating chronic neurodegenerative diseases. Implementing combined therapeutic strategies that integrate multiple intervention methods could also enhance treatment outcomes."

This review explores the application of radiomics in neurodegenerative diseases, with a focus on Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and multiple sclerosis.

    "abstract": "Although the pathogenesis of the neurodegenerative phenomena of Huntington's disease (HD) is not well known, in the last 30 years, numerous data have been published that suggest a possible role of oxidative stress. The majority of studies regarding this issue were performed in different experimental models of this disease (neurotoxic models such as intraperitoneal injection of 3-nitropropionic acid or intrastriatal injection of quinolinic acid, transgenic animal models for HD, and cell cultures) and, less frequently, in samples of brain tissue, plasma/serum, blood cells, and other tissues from patients with a genetic-molecular diagnosis of presymptomatic and symptomatic HD compared to healthy controls. In this narrative review, we have summarized the data from the main studies in which oxidative stress parameters have been measured both in patients with HD and in experimental models of the same disease, as well as the few studies on gene variants involved in oxidative stress in patients with HD. Most studies addressing this issue in experimental models of HD have shown an increase in markers or oxidative stress, a decrease in antioxidant substances, or both. However, the results of studies on patients with HD have not been conclusive as few studies have been published on the matter. However, a meta-analysis of blood studies on HD patients (including a pool of serum and blood cell studies) has shown an increase in lipid peroxidation markers, OH8dG concentrations, and GPx activity and a decrease in GSH levels. Future prospective and multicenter studies with a long-term follow-up period involving a large number of HD patients and healthy controls are needed to address this topic."

    "abstract": "Protein misfolding is linked to many neurodegenerative disorders, such as Huntington's disease. The increase of glutamine-encoding CAG repeats in the first exon of Huntingtin (<i>HTT</i>) causes Huntington's disease. Protein fragments of Htt exon 1 with polyQ expansion (mHtt) are prone to aggregation, resulting in oligomers, amyloid fibrils, or large inclusion bodies. Previous studies demonstrate mHtt SUMOylation, a process of covalent attachment of <u>s</u>mall <u>u</u>biquitin-like <u>mo</u>difiers (SUMOs) to target proteins. Protein polySUMOylation further triggers its ubiquitination and segregation by the polySUMO axis. Here, we examined how SUMOylation regulates aggregation and degradation of Htt103QP-GFP, a model mHtt, in budding yeast. We first confirmed Htt103QP-GFP SUMOylation in budding yeast. We also found that recruitment of the SUMO E2 conjugating enzyme to Htt103QP-GFP accelerates its aggregation, but recruitment of a SUMO protease to Htt103QP-GFP delays this process. Disruption of the polySUMO axis led to increased Htt103QP-GFP aggregation. Interestingly, the results from FRAP assay and treatment with a biomolecular condensate-disrupting chemical indicate that SUMOylation accelerates biomolecular condensate formation of Htt103QP-GFP. Importantly, impaired SUMOylation delays Htt103QP-GFP proteasomal degradation and accelerates formation of SDS-insoluble Htt103QP-GFP aggregates. Together, these results indicate that SUMOylation facilitates proteasomal degradation of misfolded proteins by retaining their solubility."

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative disorders (NDDs), characterized by a progressive loss of neurons and cognitive function, are a severe burden to human health and mental fitness worldwide. A hallmark of NDDs such as Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and prion diseases is disturbed cellular proteostasis, resulting in pathogenic deposition of aggregated protein species. Autophagy is a major cellular process maintaining proteostasis and integral to innate immune defenses that mediates lysosomal protein turnover. Defects in autophagy are thus frequently associated with NDDs. In this review, we discuss the interplay between NDDs associated proteins and autophagy and provide an overview over recent discoveries in inborn errors in canonical autophagy proteins that are associated with NDDs. While mutations in autophagy receptors seems to be associated mainly with the development of ALS, errors in mitophagy are mainly found to promote PD. Finally, we argue whether autophagy may impact progress and onset of the disease, as well as the potential of targeting autophagy as a therapeutic approach. Concludingly, understanding disorders due to inborn errors in autophagy-\"autophagopathies\"-will help to unravel underlying NDD pathomechanisms and provide unique insights into the neuroprotective role of autophagy, thus potentially paving the way for novel therapeutic interventions."

    "abstract": "Expansion of the CAG trinucleotide repeat tract in exon 1 of the Huntingtin (HTT) gene causes Huntington's disease (HD) through the expression of a polyglutamine-expanded form of the HTT protein. This mutation triggers cellular and biochemical pathologies, leading to cognitive, motor, and psychiatric symptoms in HD patients. Targeting HTT splicing with small molecule drugs is a compelling approach to lowering HTT protein levels to treat HD, and splice modulators are currently being tested in the clinic. Here, we identify PRMT5 as a novel regulator of HTT messenger RNA (mRNA) splicing and alternative polyadenylation. PRMT5 inhibition disrupts the splicing of HTT introns 9 and 10, leading to the activation of multiple proximal intronic polyadenylation sites within these introns and promoting premature termination, cleavage, and polyadenylation of the HTT mRNA. This suggests that HTT protein levels may be lowered due to this mechanism. We also detected increasing levels of these truncated HTT transcripts across a series of neuronal differentiation samples, which correlated with lower PRMT5 expression. Notably, PRMT5 inhibition in glioblastoma stem cells potently induced neuronal differentiation. We posit that PRMT5-mediated regulation of intronic polyadenylation, premature termination, and cleavage of the HTT mRNA modulates HTT expression and plays an important role during neuronal differentiation."

Its prevalence is highest in individuals of European descent. However, a previous study in 2007 in Iceland showed an unusually low incidence and prevalence. The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence and prevalence of HD in Iceland between 2008 and 2022 as well as age, sex, symptoms, number of cytidine-adenosine-guanosine (CAG) repeats, treatment, and prognosis. A retrospective epidemiological study was conducted with clinical information obtained from medical records of individuals diagnosed with HD 2008-2022. Information was also obtained from the Department of Genetics at University Hospital of Iceland and neurologists managing HD patients. Among the 22 diagnosed individuals (11 men) identified, the point prevalence on December 31, 2022, was 4.38 per 100,000 inhabitants, with an average annual incidence rate of 0.314 per 100,000 person-years. The average age at symptom onset was 46.3 years. A total of 21 out of 22 individuals had confirmed HD through genetic testing, with an average CAG repeat length of 42.3 (range 40-45). Five individuals died during the study period, with the most common cause of death being aspiration pneumonia. The average age at death was 70.4 years. The prevalence and incidence of HD in Iceland have increased compared to the 2007 study but remain lower than in other European populations. Results showed a lower number of CAG repeats in the Icelandic HD population, potentially explaining the higher age at symptom onset and death compared to global averages."

A total of 215 lung cancer patients with BrMs confirmed by surgical pathology were retrospectively included in five centres, 167 patients were assigned to the training cohort, and 48 to the external test cohort. All patients underwent regular follow-up brain MRIs. Clinical and morphological MRI models for predicting RFS were built using univariate and multivariate Cox regressions, respectively. Handcrafted and deep learning (DL) signatures were constructed from BrMs pretreatment MR images using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method, respectively. A DLRM was established by integrating the clinical and morphological MRI predictors, handcrafted and DL signatures based on the multivariate Cox regression coefficients. The Harrell C-index, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), and Kaplan-Meier's survival analysis were used to evaluate model performance. The DLRM showed satisfactory performance in predicting RFS and 6- to 18-month intracranial recurrence in lung cancer patients after BrMs resection, achieving a C-index of 0.79 and AUCs of 0.84-0.90 in the training set and a C-index of 0.74 and AUCs of 0.71-0.85 in the external test set. The DLRM outperformed the clinical model, morphological MRI model, handcrafted signature, DL signature, and clinical-morphological MRI model in predicting RFS (P < 0.05). The DLRM successfully classified patients into high-risk and low-risk intracranial recurrence groups (P < 0.001). This MRI-based DLRM could predict RFS in lung cancer patients after surgical resection of BrMs."

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), Multiple sclerosis (MS), Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) are neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) characterized by progressive neuronal degeneration. Recent studies provide compelling information regarding the contribution of Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide (CGRP), a potent neuropeptide, in regulating neuroinflammation, vasodilation, and neuronal survival in these disorders. This review systematically delves into the multidimensional aspects of CGRP as both a neuroprotective agent and a neurotoxic factor in NDDs. The neuroprotective effects of CGRP include suppression of inflammation, regulation of intracellular signaling pathways, and promotion of neuronal growth and survival. However, under pathological conditions, its overexpression or dysregulation is associated with oxidative stress, excitotoxicity, and neuronal death. The therapeutic use of CGRP and its receptor antagonists in migraine provides substantial evidence for CGRP's therapeutic potential, which can be further explored for the management of NDDs. However, since the bidirectional nature of CGRP effects is evident, it is crucial to gain an accurate insight into its mechanisms to target only the neuropeptide's beneficial effects while completely avoiding the undesired consequences. Further studies should focus on understanding the context-dependent activity of CGRP in the hope of designing targeted therapy for NDDs, which could gradually transform the current pharmacological management of NDDs."

    "abstract": "Non-communicable neurological disorders are the second leading cause of death, and their burden continues to increase as the world population grows and ages. Oxidative stress and inflammation are crucially implicated in the triggering and progression of multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, and even stroke. In this narrative review, we examine the role of xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) activities and products in all the above-cited neurological diseases. The redox imbalance responsible for oxidative stress could arise from excess reactive oxygen and nitrogen species resulting from the activities of XOR, as well as from the deficiency of its main product, uric acid (UA), which is the pivotal antioxidant system in the blood. In fact, with the exception of stroke, serum UA levels are inversely related to the onset and progression of these neurological disorders. The inverse correlation observed between the level of uricemia and the presence of neurological diseases suggests a neuroprotective role for UA. Oxidative stress and inflammation are also caused by ischemia and reperfusion, a condition in which XOR action has been recognized as a contributing factor to tissue damage. The findings reported in this review could be useful for addressing clinical decision-making and treatment optimization."

    "abstract": "<i>Amburana cearensis</i> is a plant native to Brazil used in folk medicine for the treatment of several pathological conditions including stroke. Previous research indicates that a dichloromethane extract of <i>A. cearensis</i> seeds (EDAC), rich in coumarins, protects neural cells against oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) and glutamate-induced stress. However, further studies are needed to elucidate the role of coumarin, in the protective effect of EDAC. Glutamatergic excitotoxicity is an important cause of neuronal loss involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, and ischemic stroke. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the protective effects of coumarin isolated from EDAC against glutamate excitotoxicity in regulating MAPK pathway proteins and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production on PC12 cells. Furthermore, we aimed to investigate the protective effects of coumarin against cell death induced by OGD. We characterized the isolated compound from EDAC as coumarin by <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>13</sup>C-NMR. Thus, PC12 cells were exposed to OGD or glutamate (20 mM) and/or treated with EDAC or coumarin (500 μg/mL) for 24 h. Subsequently, cell viability was assessed by propidium iodide staining or by MTT test. Furthermore, the expression of MAPK pathway proteins was investigated by Western blot analysis and the expression of cleaved caspase-3 by immunofluorescence. Furthermore, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was assessed by 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate and CellROX. We observed that EDAC and coumarin were able to protect PC12 cells against OGD conditions. Moreover, EDAC totally inhibited the glutamate toxicity in PC12 cells. Meanwhile, coumarin mitigated the glutamate toxicity. Both were able to downregulate the expression of ERK1/2 and phosphorylated ERK and inhibit caspase-3 activation. EDAC and coumarin also prevented the increase of ROS induced by treatment with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> or glutamate. Our results evidenced that coumarin from <i>A. cearensis</i> is antioxidative and is an important cytoprotective compound in EDAC against glutamate excitotoxicity or OGD injury."

    "abstract": "Neuronal senescence (i.e., neurescent) is an important hallmark of aging and neurodegeneration, but it remains poorly characterized in the human brain due to the lack of reliable markers. This study aimed to identify neurescent markers based on single-nucleus transcriptome data from postmortem human prefrontal cortex. Using an eigengene approach, we integrated three gene panels: a) SenMayo, b) Canonical Senescence Pathway (CSP), and c) Senescence Initiating Pathway (SIP), to identify neurescent signatures. We found that paired markers outperform single markers; for instance, by combining <i>CDKN2D</i> and <i>ETS2</i> in a decision tree, a high accuracy of 99% and perfect specificity (100%) were achieved in distinguishing neurescent. Differential expression analyses identified 324 genes that are overexpressed in neurescent. These genes showed significant associations with important neurodegeneration-related pathways including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease. Interestingly, several of these overexpressed genes are linked to mitochondrial dysfunction and cytoskeletal dysregulation. These findings provide valuable insights into the complexities of neurescent, emphasizing the need for further exploration of histologically viable markers and validation in broader datasets."

Here, we report the isolation and complete genome sequence of two isolates of cetacean picornavirus 1 (Senecavirus cetus), a novel picornavirus species of the Senecavirus genus from dead stranded cetaceans from Alaska. One isolate was from a harbor porpoise stranded in 2017, and another from a beluga whale, stranded in 2019. Whole-genome sequencing of Senecavirus cetus strains showed a genome-wide nucleotide identity of 98.8% and a genome size of 7455 nucleotides. The Senecavirus cetus genomes are most similar to SVA with a 58.3% genome-wide pairwise nucleotide identity. Infection of eleven available cell lines from terrestrial and aquatic animals showed that beluga and sheep cells were susceptible to infection by Senecavirus cetus. Phylogenetic and ancestral state reconstruction analyses supported the novel virus being a member of the Senecavirus genus and provided the first evidence of Senecavirus-like picornavirus infecting marine mammals and likely descending from a terrestrial host ancestor. These discoveries provided important information on the evolutionary relationships and taxonomy of picornaviruses and increased our understanding of the genomic characteristics and potential host range of Senecavirus cetus."

The primary objective of this study was to characterize how settings where patients with HD in Northern America receive care change throughout the disease course and determine whether the likelihood of different types of service utilization is influenced by clinical, sociodemographic, and caregiver characteristics. Data from the Enroll-HD study and joinpoint regression were used to assess trends in neurology visits, general practitioner visits, emergency department visits, and inpatient stays over the disease course and as a function of total functional capacity. Generalized estimating equation models were then used to identify factors associated with use of these different services in the 6 months before their study visit. Visits from 1,631 participants in the Northern America region from the Enroll-HD study were included in this study. Trends in neurology, emergency, and inpatient visits remained constant over most of the disease duration. For the general practitioner visits, there was an increasing trend in use throughout the course of disease. Clinical factors, such as psychiatric symptoms, functional ability, and comorbidities, were associated with use of multiple types of health care services. Sociodemographic and caregiver factors, such as race or ethnicity, urban or rural residence, and caregiver employment status, were also associated with use of multiple health care services. Clinical, sociodemographic, and caregiver-related factors were all associated with outpatient, emergent, and inpatient care. This work identifies multiple avenues for future research on how to improve access to and quality of care for patients with HD, specifically relating to reducing the need for emergency visits and inpatient stays and promoting collaboration among primary and specialty clinicians."

Notably, the polyQ tract in Httex1 is flanked by an N-terminal coiled-coil domain -N17 (17 amino acids), which promotes the formation of soluble oligomers and brings the aggregation-prone polyQ tracts in close proximity. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the conversion of soluble oligomers into insoluble β-rich aggregates with increasing polyQ length, remain unclear. In this study, extensive atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations (aggregate time ≈0.7 milliseconds) are performed to uncover the interplay between structural transformation and domain \"cross-talk\" on the conformational ensemble and oligomerization of Httex1 due to polyQ expansion. Notably, MD-derived ensembles of N17-Q<sub>n</sub>-P<sub>5</sub> monomers validated against NMR indicated that in addition to elevated α-helicity, polyQ expansion also favored transient, interdomain (N17/polyQ) interactions which resulted in the emergence of β-sheet conformations. Further, interdomain interactions modulated the stability of N17-mediated polyQ dimers and promoted a heterogeneous dimerization landscape. Finally, it is observed that the intact C-terminal proline-rich domain (PRD) promoted condensation of Httex1 through self-interactions involving its P<sub>10</sub>/P<sub>11</sub> tracts while also interacting with N17 to suppress its α-helicity."

Although experiments have shown an altered epigenetic landscape and chromatin architecture upon HD development, the structural consequences on the HTT gene remain elusive. Structural data are only available for model nucleosome systems and yeast systems with human nucleosomes. Here, we use our experimentally validated nucleosome-resolution mesoscale chromatin model to investigate folding changes of the HTT gene associated with HD. We investigate how the histone fold domain of the variant macroH2A1, a biomarker of HD, affects the genome structure by modeling HD-like systems that contain (i) 100% canonical, (ii) 100% macroH2A1, (iii) 50% canonical and 50% macroH2A1, and (iv) 100% hybrid cores (one canonical H2A and one macroH2A1 per nucleosome). Then, we model the mouse HTT gene in healthy and HD conditions by incorporating the CAG expansion and macroH2A1 cores, reducing the linker histone density and tail acetylation levels, and incorporating genomic contacts. Overall, our results show that the histone fold domain of macroH2A1 affects chromatin compaction in a fiber-dependent manner (i.e., nucleosome distribution dependent) and can thus both enhance or repress HTT gene expression. Our modeling of the HTT gene shows that HTT is less compact in the diseased condition, which could accelerate the production of the mutated protein. By suggesting the structural biophysical consequences of the HTT gene under HD conditions, our findings may help in the development of diagnostic and therapeutic treatments for HD."

Genetic variations in the pleiotropic 9p21 risk locus further shape premature aging, disease susceptibility, and have been strongly linked to cardiovascular disease (CVD), metabolic disorders, certain cancers, and neurodegenerative conditions. However, given that this region was discovered based on Genome-Wide Association Studies, the mechanisms by which 9p21 exerts its effects remain poorly understood and its interactions with diet and biomarkers are insufficiently explored. <b>Methods</b>: This study investigated the association between the rs2383206 SNP in 9p21, dietary patterns, and plasma proteomic biomarkers in a multi-ethnic cohort of 1280 young adults from the Toronto Nutrigenomics and Health Study. Participants' dietary intake was assessed using a validated food frequency questionnaire, and dietary patterns were categorized using principal component analysis. Plasma proteomics analyses quantified 54 abundant proteins involved in the cardiometabolic and inflammatory pathways. Genotyping identified individuals who were homozygous for the 9p21 risk allele (GG), known to confer the highest susceptibility risk to premature aging and multiple chronic diseases. <b>Results</b>: A significant interaction was observed between the 9p21 genotype and adherence to a micronutrient-rich Prudent dietary pattern for eight plasma proteins (α<sub>1</sub> Antichymotrypsin, Complement C4 β chain, Complement C4 γ chain, Complement C9, Fibrinogen α chain, Hemopexin, and Serum amyloid P-component). However, only Complement C4-γ showed a pattern consistent with the risks associated with the 9p21 genotype and adherence to a Prudent diet. Individuals with the high-risk GG genotype had significantly higher concentrations of Complement C4-γ, but only among those with a low adherence to a Prudent diet. <b>Conclusions</b>: These findings suggest that Prudent dietary patterns rich in micronutrients may counteract genetic-mediated proinflammatory susceptibility by modulating key proteomic biomarkers in young adults, highlighting the potential for tailored dietary interventions to mitigate disease risk. This study also introduces a novel framework for post hoc micronutrient resolution within dietary pattern analysis, offering a new lens to interpret nutrient synergies in gene-diet interaction research."

Within this narrative review, the vital physiological functions of SCFAs were examined, with emphasis on butyrate's role as an energy source for colonocytes and its ability to enhance the gut barrier while exhibiting anti-inflammatory effects. Knowledge of butyrate synthesis, primarily generated by Firmicutes bacteria, can be influenced by diets with specifically high contents of resistant starches and fiber. Butyrate can inhibit histone deacetylase, modulate gene expression, influence immune functionality, and regulate tight junction integrity, supporting the idea of its role in gut barrier preservation. Butyrate possesses systemic anti-inflammatory properties, particularly, its capacity to reduce pro-inflammatory cytokines and maintain immune homeostasis, highlighting its therapeutic potential in managing dysbiosis and inflammatory diseases. Although butyrate absorption into circulation is typically minimal, its broader health implications are substantial, especially regarding obesity and type 2 diabetes through its influence on metabolic regulation and inflammation. Furthermore, this narrative review thoroughly examines butyrate's growing recognition as a modulator of neurological health via its interaction with the gut-brain axis. Additionally, butyrate's neuroprotective effects are mediated through activation of specific G-protein-coupled receptors, such as FFAR3 and GPR109a, and inhibition of histone deacetylases (HDACs). Research indicates that butyrate can alleviate neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, autism spectrum disorder, and Huntington's disease, by reducing neuroinflammation, enhancing neurotransmitter modulation, and improving histone acetylation. This focus will help unlock its full therapeutic potential for metabolic and neurological health, rather than exclusively on its well-known benefits for gut health, as these are often interconnected."

Among the features of HD, oxidative stress plays a relevant role in the progression of the disease at the cellular level. Mitochondrial dysfunction, bioenergetic deficits, Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) production, neuroinflammation, and general reduction of antioxidant levels are all involved in the promotion of a toxic oxidative environment, eventually causing cell death. Nonetheless, neuronal cells exert antioxidant molecules to build up defense mechanisms. Key components of these defensive mechanisms are the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 α (PGC-1α). Thus, this review aims to describe the involvement of oxidative stress in HD by exploring the roles of NRF2 and PGC-1α, crucial actors in this play. Finally, antioxidant therapeutic strategies targeting such markers are discussed."

    "abstract": "The global demographic is witnessing an unprecedented surge in aging, precipitating a dramatic rise in geriatric diseases and related health complications. Although probiotics have been extensively shown to maintain microbiome stability and confer health benefits, their potential role in decelerating the aging process remains largely unexplored. The study identified a beneficial gut microbe from human intestinal tract, Enterococcus faecalis SI-FC-01, which was proved to be biosafe and found to enhance the average lifespan of C. elegans by 33.55%. More interestingly, the E. faecalis SI-FC-01 also enhanced the motor ability, memory and learning ability and anti-oxidative stress ability of C. elegans. Moreover, it exhibited neuroprotective effects in the worm models of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease. Through screening various aging-associated mutants of C. elegans, we discovered that E. faecalis SI-FC-01 modulates DAF-16/FOXO signaling via the activation of AKT pathway. This activation subsequently triggers stress resistance and immune-related genes downstream of daf-16, thereby promoting healthspan and neuroprotection. In summary, our research indicates that E. faecalis SI-FC-01 holds significant potential as a dietary supplement for delaying host aging. Furthermore, it provides novel insights for potentially mitigating the progression of age-related neurodegenerative diseases."

    "title": "Neuroadaptation in neurodegenerative diseases: compensatory mechanisms and therapeutic approaches.",
    "abstract": "Progressive neuronal loss is a hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's, and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), which cause cognitive and motor impairment. Delaying the onset and course of symptoms is largely dependent on neuroadaptation, the brain's ability to restructure in response to damage. The molecular, cellular, and systemic processes that underlie neuroadaptation are examined in this study. These mechanisms include gliosis, neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity, and changes in neurotrophic factors. Axonal sprouting, dendritic remodelling, and compensatory alterations in neurotransmitter systems are important adaptations observed in NDDs; nevertheless, these processes may shift to maladaptive plasticity, which would aid in the advancement of the illness. Amyloid and tau pathology-induced synaptic alterations in Alzheimer's disease emphasize compensatory network reconfiguration. Dopamine depletion causes a major remodelling of the basal ganglia in Parkinson's disease, and non-dopaminergic systems compensate. Both ALS and Huntington's disease rely on motor circuit rearrangement and transcriptional dysregulation to slow down functional deterioration. Neuroadaptation is, however, constrained by oxidative stress, compromised autophagy, and neuroinflammation, particularly in elderly populations. The goal of emerging therapy strategies is to improve neuroadaptation by pharmacologically modifying neurotrophic factors, neuroinflammation, and synaptic plasticity. Neurostimulation, cognitive training, and physical rehabilitation are instances of non-pharmacological therapies that support neuroplasticity. Restoring compensating systems may be possible with the use of stem cell techniques and new gene treatments. The goal of future research is to combine biomarkers and individualized medicines to maximize neuroadaptive responses and decrease the course of illness. In order to reduce neurodegeneration and enhance patient outcomes, this review highlights the dual function of neuroadaptation in NDDs and its potential as a therapeutic target."

    "abstract": "Huntington's disease is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder affecting striato-cortical circuits, with significant heterogeneity in the severity and progression of symptoms and neurodegenerative patterns. To identify how distinct functional striato-cortical connectivity signatures may predict clinical profiles in Huntington's disease. Thirty-eight Huntington's disease gene expansion carriers underwent cross-sectional motor, cognitive, and behavioral assessments and multimodal MRI. Principal component analysis was employed to characterize Huntington's disease clinical profiles. Next, seed-based whole-brain functional connectivity maps were derived for three basal ganglia seeds (caudate nucleus, putamen, nucleus accumbens) to delineate cortico-striatal connections. Multiple linear regressions assessed relationships between resulting clinical profiles and seed-based resting-state functional connectivity maps. Finally, basal ganglia gray matter volumes were examined in relation to clinical profiles and connectivity. Principal component analysis identified two main clinical profiles in Huntington's disease: motor-cognitive and behavioral. Multiple linear regression models revealed distinct functional neural signatures associated with each profile. Motor-cognitive symptoms related with a divergent connectivity pattern, specifically decreased connectivity between the caudate and putamen with executive and premotor areas, in contrast to increased connectivity between the ventral nucleus accumbens and executive network regions. Meanwhile, the behavioral profile was linked to decreased connectivity in limbic networks. Basal ganglia atrophy was associated with increased nucleus accumbens-cortical connectivity as well as motor-cognitive symptom severity. Distinct Huntington's disease clinical profiles can be characterized by predominantly motor-cognitive or behavioral disturbances, each related with unique functional and structural brain signatures. This substantiates that striato-cortical circuits exhibit functional interaction and potential reorganization."

    "abstract": "Aging is a slow and irreversible biological process leading to decreased cell and tissue functions with higher risks of multiple age-related diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases. It is widely accepted that aging represents the leading risk factor for neurodegeneration. The pathogenesis of these diseases involves complex interactions of genetic mutations, environmental factors, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and mitochondrial dysfunction, which complicate treatment with traditional mono-targeted therapies. Network pharmacology can help identify potential gene or protein targets related to neurodegenerative diseases. Integrating advanced molecular profiling technologies and computer-aided drug design further enhances the potential of network pharmacology, enabling the identification of biomarkers and therapeutic targets, thus paving the way for precision medicine in neurodegenerative diseases. This review article delves into the application of network pharmacology in understanding and treating neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington's disease, and spinal muscular atrophy. Overall, this article emphasizes the importance of addressing aging as a central factor in developing effective disease-modifying therapies, highlighting how network pharmacology can unravel the complex biological networks associated with aging and pave the way for personalized medical strategies."

    "abstract": "In models of infectious disease dynamics, the incorporation of contact network information allows for the capture of the non-randomness and heterogeneity of realistic contact patterns. Oftentimes, it is assumed that this underlying network is known with perfect certainty. However, in realistic settings, the observed data usually serves as an imperfect proxy of the actual contact patterns in the population. Furthermore, event times in observed epidemics are not perfectly recorded; individual infection and recovery times are often missing. In order to conduct accurate inferences on parameters of contagion spread, it is crucial to incorporate these sources of uncertainty. In this paper, we propose the use of Network-augmented Mixture Density Network-compressed ABC (NA-MDN-ABC) to learn informative summary statistics for the available data. This method will allow for Bayesian inference on the parameters of a contagious process, while accounting for imperfect observations on the epidemic and the contact network. We will demonstrate the use of this method on simulated epidemics and networks, and extend this framework to analyze the spread of Tattoo Skin Disease (TSD) among bottlenose dolphins in Shark Bay, Australia."

    "abstract": "BackgroundSynaptic dysfunction underlies early sensorimotor and cognitive deficits in Huntington's disease (HD) and precedes the degeneration of striatal spiny projection neurons and cortical pyramidal neurons. Movement selection and motor learning, which are impaired early in HD, are regulated by connections between the motor cortex, basal ganglia and thalamus. In particular, plasticity at corticostriatal synapses, including endocannabinoid-mediated long-term depression (LTD), is critical for motor learning. Previously, we found impaired endocannabinoid-mediated LTD, induced by high frequency stimulation (HFS) at corticostriatal synapses in brain slice recordings from pre-manifest HD mouse models, which was corrected by JZL184, an inhibitor of endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG) degradation.ObjectiveDetermine the effects of <i>in vivo</i> JZL184 administration on YAC128 HD model and wild-type (WT) littermate mice.MethodsJZL184 was administered to mice orally over a 3-week period and their motor function was assessed using several behavioral tasks. In addition, brain tissue was collected from mice in order to quantify changes in endocannabinoid levels and measure HFS-induced plasticity at corticostriatal synapses.ResultsOral administration of JZL184 significantly increased levels of 2-AG in striatal tissue. While JZL184 treatment had no impact on open field behavior, the treatment eliminated the difference in motor learning on the rotarod task between YAC128 and WT mice. Moreover, HFS-induced striatal plasticity in YAC128 mice was normalized to WT levels after JZL184 treatment.ConclusionsThese results suggest a novel target for mitigating early symptoms of HD and support the need for clinical trials of therapies that modulate the endocannabinoid system."

The effect of dopaminergic treatment on apathy is inconsistent, depending on the stage of the disease, the type of apathy and strongly influenced by placebo effect. Our study assessed the evolution of a cohort of 86 de novo, drug naive PD patients for 4 years, after dopaminergic treatment introduction. The main objective of the study was the change of apathy from baseline to follow-up and secondary outcomes were the change of other neuropsychiatric symptoms. At 4 years there was an improvement of apathy (p = 0.002), mainly driven by improvement of baseline apathy (p = 0.001). This was associated with an improvement of anxiety (p = 0.001), an increase in hyperdopaminergic behavior including nocturnal hyperactivity with consecutive diurnal sleepiness (p = 0.001 and p < 0.001), independently of the presence of apathy at baseline. These findings confirm, in a large real-life cohort, that dopaminergic treatment improves motivational apathy in early PD."

    "abstract": "Temporal risk aversion can justify a social genetic insurance scheme, even in the absence of reclassification risk. I model individuals who take a genetic test in period 0 and may become ill in period 2. I show that redistributing from low-risk to high-risk individuals in period 1 can increase social welfare, even when the high-risk are not financially penalized. Temporally risk-averse individuals value reductions in the risk to their lifetime utility brought by illness, such as increased morbidity and mortality. A social insurance can achieve this by taxing the low-risk and subsidizing the high-risk. I calibrate a multi-period life-cycle model for breast cancer and Huntington's disease and quantify the optimal redistribution. For these two conditions, which are rare, substantial transfers to the high-risk can be achieved with minimal taxation on the low-risk. Thus, the welfare of the high-risk is substantially improved with little impact on the low-risk."

    "abstract": "As cities seek to provide more habitat for wildlife, there may be unintended consequences of increasing tick-borne disease hazards. In the United States, the Northeast is both highly urban and a hotspot for blacklegged ticks (<i>Ixodes scapularis</i>) and tick-borne disease emergence. Though tick-borne disease was once considered a suburban and rural problem, tick-borne hazards in urban landscapes are increasing. We hypothesized that multi-scale ecological processes hierarchically contribute to tick-borne hazards across an urbanization gradient. Urban greenspaces with higher functional connectivity to deer movement would have higher deer occupancy at the 'ecological neighborhood' scale, resulting in increased blacklegged tick populations and pathogen infection at the scale of within greenspaces. To evaluate our hypothesis, we used circuit theory methods to model the impact of functional connectivity on deer occupancy, blacklegged tick abundance, and pathogen infected ticks across an urbanization gradient. We sampled nymphal ticks during their peak activity and deployed wildlife cameras to detect deer at 38 greenspaces across New York City and Long Island, NY from 2022 to 2023. We found that functional connectivity significantly predicted deer occupancy with cascading effects on abundance of blacklegged nymphal ticks and <i>Borrelia burgdorferi</i> infection. We novelly identified a threshold of functional connectivity in urban areas necessary for deer occupancy, tick populations, and tick infection with <i>B. burgdorferi</i>, to emerge in urban environments. We recommend targeted tick-borne hazard mitigation along this functional connectivity threshold as part of urban greenspace management plans. Additionally, we highlight the importance of examining multi-scale landscape drivers of host, tick, and pathogen interactions.

In hospitals, including emergency departments (EDs), testing is largely limited to indicator-condition-guided testing (IC), with written consent universally required. We developed a closed-cohort hybrid decision tree-Markov model to compare health economic values of two HIV testing strategies in the ED: (1) universal opt-out and (2) IC (Italian standard of care). Data sources included healthcare costs and HIV public health data, obtained from national reports and published studies. A lifetime time horizon and a National Health Service perspective were used. Primary outcomes were life years, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and costs. Universal opt-out testing resulted in better health outcomes at higher costs. For every 10 000 individuals attending ED, opt-out testing resulted in 15.78 additional new HIV diagnoses and 14.47 more people linked to HIV care compared with IC. Prevalence threshold analysis demonstrated that opt-out testing was cost-effective compared to IC when the HIV prevalence was 0.25% or higher, assuming a willingness-to-pay threshold of €30 000/QALY. Universal opt-out HIV testing in the ED could be a cost-effective way to increase the number of new HIV diagnoses and improve HIV health outcomes in Italy. The model may underestimate the full benefits of this strategy as our model did not consider disengaged patients or transmissions averted. Further research using real-world data is needed to verify our findings."

    "abstract": "Huntington's disease (HD) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease caused by CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the huntingtin gene (Htt) resulting in an expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) tract in the huntingtin (HTT) protein. The expanded polyQ alters structure of HTT making it susceptible to aggregation. The expression of mutant HTT (mHTT) causes dysregulation of several key cellular pathways in neuronal cells resulting in neurodegeneration. Recent studies have demonstrated phosphorylation of the N-terminal domain of the huntingtin (N-HTT) protein as an important regulator of its localization, structure, aggregation, clearance and toxicity. Most studies have focused on the effect of phosphorylation of Ser13 and Ser16 in N-HTT on protein aggregation and reported a drastic reduction in aggregation. However, the downstream impact of this phosphorylation status on key cellular pathways is largely unexplored. Utilizing an inducible cell line model for expression of Exon 1 fragment of mHTT bearing 150 polyglutamine repeats (HD150Q), we demonstrate that kinetin induced phosphorylation at Ser13 and Ser16 of N-HTT resulted in prevention of aggregation as well as resolution of preformed aggregates. Furthermore, kinetin treatment led to rescue of ATP levels and transcription of key genes as well as significant reduction in mitochondrial ROS levels restoring mitochondrial function. Notably, ER stress markers were significantly reduced at transcriptional, translational and post-translational levels. Restoration of mitochondrial function and mitigation of ER stress lead to significant improvement in cell survival. These findings further strengthen the view that HTT N-terminal phosphorylation is a promising therapeutic target for HD."

Phytoconstituents of S.officinalis were obtained from various databases, followed by the screening of active ingredients using the Swiss ADME web tool. Potential targets of active ingredients were identified using PubChem & SwissTargetPrediction. Genes related to Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and Huntington's disease (HD) were gathered using online databases. Besides, the correlation between active ingredient targets and disease-associated genes was linked. Networks were constructed, visualized, and analyzed using Cytoscape. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genome (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis were performed using DAVID database. Decisively, Autodock was used for molecular docking. The results of network analysis identified 9 key active ingredients based on topological analysis of the active ingredient-candidate targets network. Also, the analysis revealed a shared target of 9 key active ingredients of S. officinalis that interacted with 133 AD-related targets whereas only 6 active ingredients interacted with 85 and 58 targets of PD and HD respectively. The core genes from the network were AKT1, BACE1, CASP3, MAPK1, TNF, and IL6. Furthermore, GO and KEGG enrichment analysis showed that FOXO, TNF, MAPK, PI3K-Akt, Rap 1, and neurotrophin signalling pathways as enriched, which were further evaluated by molecular docking suggesting the protective role of S. officinalis in neurodegenerative diseases. Our research reveals the therapeutic benefits of S. officinalis, which might play a crucial role in modulating neurodegenerative diseases."

    "abstract": "Over the past two decades, a growing number of studies have been conducted on the role of bidirectional communication through the gut-brain axis in the development of neurodegenerative diseases. These studies were driven by the curious fact that all of these diseases present varying degrees of intestinal involvement included in their wide range of symptoms. A population of cells belonging to the ENS, called enteric glial cells (EGCs), appears to actively participate in this communication between the intestine and the brain, but acting in a dualistic manner, sometimes in reactive gliosis releasing inflammatory mediators, sometimes promoting homeostasis and resilience in the face of inflammatory injuries. To date, the intracellular mechanisms that define the transcriptional profile expressed in EGCs in each situation have not yet been elucidated. This review proposes a discussion on: (1) the complex role of distinct phenotypes of enteric glial cells involved in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Huntington's disease (HD) and multiple sclerosis (MS); and (2) innovative strategies such as IDO/TDO inhibitors, Brazil nuts, caffeic acid, polyphenols, among others, that act on EGCs and have the potential to treat neurodegenerative diseases."

    "abstract": "Huntington's disease (HD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder that manifests from an N-terminal polyQ-expansion (>35) in the Huntingtin (HTT) gene leading to axonal degeneration and significant neuronal death. Despite evidence for a scaffolding role for HTT in membrane-related processes such as endocytosis, vesicle transport, and vesicle fusion, it remains unclear how polyQ-expansion alters membrane binding during these processes. Using quantitative Mass Spectrometry-based proteomics on HTT-containing light vesicle membranes isolated from healthy and HD iPSC-derived neurons, we found significant changes in the proteome and kinome of signal transduction, neuronal translation, trafficking, and axon guidance-related processes. Through a combination of in vitro kinase assays, Drosophila genetics, and pharmacological inhibitors, we identified that GSK3β and ERK1 phosphorylate HTT and that these events play distinct and opposing roles during HD with inhibition of GSK3β decreasing polyQ-mediated axonal transport defects and neuronal cell death, while inhibition of ERK enhancing these phenotypes. Together, this work proposes two novel pathways in which GSK3β phosphorylation events exacerbate and ERK phosphorylation events mitigate HD-dependent neuronal dysfunction highlighting a highly druggable pathway for targeted therapeutics using already available small molecules."

This study compares clinical characteristics occurrence and severity across age-at-onset (AO) subtypes. Using the national juvenile-onset HD patient cohort and the international Enroll-HD registry (NCT01574053), we compared childhood-onset JHD (cJHD; AO 0-10), adolescent-onset JHD (aJHD; AO 11-20), and adult-onset HD (AHD; AO 21-65) on proportions of clinical characteristics at onset and psychiatric characteristics in pooled datasets. Kruskal-Wallis test was applied to UHDRS-Total Motor Score (UHDRS-TMS) items of the Enroll-HD dataset to compare the severity of motor disease characteristics 6-10 years after onset. The combined datasets provided data from 46 patients with cJHD (mean AO 6.70, 45% female), 243 patients with aJHD (mean AO 16.70, 46% female), and 9,504 patients with AHD (mean AO 44.70, 51% female). At onset, neurocognitive symptoms occurred in 47.50% of patients with cJHD (n = 46; 95% CI 31.80%-63.70%), significantly more often compared with 24.88% of patients with aJHD (n = 209; 19.30%-31.40%) and 15.02% of those with AHD (n = 8,177; 14.30%-15.80%). Psychiatric symptoms occurred in 47.12% of patients with aJHD (95% CI 40.20%-54.10%), significantly more compared with 31.04% of patients with AHD (30.10%-32.00%). Throughout the disease, aggressive behavior occurred in 73.91% of patients with cJHD (n = 46; 95% CI 58.60%-85.20%) and 55.88% of those with aJHD (n = 238; 49.30%-62.30%), significantly more compared with 40.65% of patients with AHD (n = 9,501; 39.70%-41.70%).

Under normal physiological conditions, FOXO protein activities are negatively regulated by phosphorylation via the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt pathway, a well-known cell survival pathway: Akt phosphorylates FOXOs to inactivate their transcriptional activity by relocalizing FOXOs from the nucleus to the cytoplasm for degradation. However, under oxidative stress or absent the cellular survival drive of growth factors, FOXO proteins translocate to the nucleus and upregulate a series of target genes, thereby promoting cell growth arrest and cell death and altering mitochondrial homeostasis. FOXO gene expression is also regulated by other transcriptional factors such as p53 or autoregulation by their activities and end products. Here we summarize the structure, posttranslational modifications, and translocation of FOXOs linking to their transcriptional control of cellular functions, survival, and death, emphasizing their role in regulating the cellular response to some acute insults and chronic neurological disorders. This review will conclude with a brief section on potential therapeutic interventions that can be used to modulate FOXOs' activities when treating acute and chronic neurological disorders."

    "title": "Challenges and advances for huntingtin detection in cerebrospinal fluid: in support of relative quantification.",
    "abstract": "Huntington disease (HD) is a progressive and devastating neurodegenerative disease caused by expansion of a glutamine-coding CAG tract in the huntingtin (HTT) gene above a critical threshold of ~ 35 repeats resulting in expression of mutant HTT (mHTT). A promising treatment approach being tested in clinical trials is HTT lowering, which aims to reduce levels of the mHTT protein. Target engagement of these therapies in the brain are inferred using antibody-based assays that measure mHTT levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). These levels are typically reported as the absolute concentration of mHTT concentration, derived from a standard curve generated using a single protein standard. However, patient biofluids are a complex milieu containing different mHTT protein species, suggesting that absolute quantitation is challenging. As a result, a single recombinant protein standard may not be sufficient to interpret assay signal as molar mHTT concentration. In this study, we used immunoprecipitation and flow cytometry (IP-FCM) to investigate different factors that influence mHTT detection assay signal. Our results show that HTT protein fragmentation, protein-protein interactions, affinity tag positioning, oligomerization and polyglutamine tract length affect assay signal intensity. These findings indicate that absolute HTT quantitation in heterogeneous biological samples is not possible with current technologies using a single standard protein. We also explore the binding specificity of the MW1 anti-polyglutamine antibody, commonly used in these assays as a mHTT-selective reagent and demonstrate that mHTT binding is preferred but not specific. Furthermore, we find that MW1 depletion of mHTT for quantitation of wildtype HTT is not only incomplete, leaving residual mHTT, but also non-specific, resulting in pull down of some wildtype HTT protein. Based on these observations, we recommend that mHTT detection assays report only relative mHTT quantitation using normalized arbitrary units of assay signal intensity, rather than molar concentrations, in the assessment of central nervous system HTT lowering in ongoing clinical and preclinical studies. Further, we recommend that MW1-depletion not be used as a method for quantifying wildtype HTT protein and that detergent be consistently added to samples during testing."

    "title": "Intersecting impact of CAG repeat and huntingtin knockout in stem cell-derived cortical neurons.",
    "abstract": "Huntington's Disease (HD) is caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the gene encoding huntingtin (HTT). While normal HTT function appears impacted by the mutation, the specific pathways unique to CAG repeat expansion versus loss of normal function are unclear. To understand the impact of the CAG repeat expansion, we evaluated biological signatures of HTT knockout (HTT KO) versus those that occur from the CAG repeat expansion by applying multi-omics, live cell imaging, survival analysis and a novel feature-based pipeline to study cortical neurons (eCNs) derived from an isogenic human embryonic stem cell series (RUES2). HTT KO and the CAG repeat expansion influence developmental trajectories of eCNs, with opposing effects on growth. Network analyses of differentially expressed genes and proteins associated with enriched epigenetic motifs identified subnetworks common to CAG repeat expansion and HTT KO that include neuronal differentiation, cell cycle regulation, and mechanisms related to transcriptional repression, and may represent gain-of-function mechanisms that cannot be explained by HTT loss of function alone. A combination of dominant and loss-of-function mechanisms are likely involved in the aberrant neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative features of HD that can help inform therapeutic strategies."

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Huntington's disease (HD), are defined by aberrant protein accumulation, brain atrophy, and gradual decline of neuronal function. Despite the considerable endeavors devoted to discovering treatments for NDs in recent decades, the demand for efficient therapeutic agents persists. Sertoli cells (SCs) play a crucial role in providing a supportive structure and environment for the development of germ cells. SCs, whether transplanted as xenogeneic or allogeneic cells, present a viable choice for enhancing graft persistence via the release of immunomodulatory and trophic factors, including neurturin (NTN), platelet-derived growth factor, Fas (CD95) ligand (FasL), glial-derived neurotrophic factor, interleukin 1 (IL1), brain-derived neurotrophic factor, interleukin 6 (IL6), transforming growth factors, and vascular growth factor, that protect replaced cells and tissues from the immune system. However, there is currently no cohesive evidence regarding the neuroprotective influence of the transplantation of SCs on NDs. Therefore, this review focuses on assessing stem cells' neuroprotective impact on neurodegenerative diseases in pre-clinical settings and presenting cohesive information. A comprehensive search was conducted between 2000 and 2022. In the identification stage, after a comprehensive search across databases, including Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed/Medline, 103 papers were obtained. The search conducted in the present study yielded a total of nine relevant papers on the therapeutic effect of the transplantation of SCs on NDs. It was found that the transplantation of SCs exhibits a promising impact on enhancing the symptoms of neurological diseases in rats. The findings highlight the need for multiple standardized pre-clinical trials to find reliable information to confirm the utilization of the transplantation of SCs and the reduction of the symptoms of neurodegenerative diseases."

    "abstract": "The increasing interest in the pro-apoptotic function of calpain-2 in the course of Huntington's disease (HD) is attributed to the involvement of its substrate, cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5), in neuronal death during neurodegeneration. Oxytocin has been demonstrated to suppress apoptosis in many neurodegenerative disorders. This research aimed to investigate the effect of oxytocin on several calpain 2-induced apoptogenic factors in 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NP) animal model of HD in rats. For 14 days, rats received 3-NP (10 mg/kg, i.p.), and oxytocin (160 µg/kg, i.p.) 1 h before 3-NP administration. Oxytocin reversed the detrimental effects of 3-NP on the striatum, which was evidenced by improvement of motor behavior, as well as histological picture and neurochemical balance. Oxytocin markedly reduced striatal calpain-2 and p25 Cdk5 protein expressions and increased the endogenous calpain inhibitor, calpastatin expression along with the pro-survival factor, myocyte-enhancer factor 2 (MEF-2) contents. Moreover, it suppressed striatal content of the pro-apoptotic biomarkers (BCl-2-associated X protein (Bax), tumor suppressor protein (p53), and caspase-3) and elevated striatal anti-apoptotic B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 2 (BCl-2) content. It repressed the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) to hinder caspase-dependent and caspase-independent apoptotic neuronal death. Oxytocin could be a promising candidate for HD management by hampering both mitochondrial and non-mitochondrial apoptosis through inhibition of calpain-2/p25 Cdk5/MEF-2 pathway."

    "abstract": "Lipid droplets are ubiquitous yet distinct intracellular organelles that are gaining attention for their uses outside of energy storage. Their formation, role in the physiological function, and the onset of the pathology have been gaining attention recently. Their structure, synthesis, and turnover play dynamic roles in both lipodystrophy and neurodegeneration. Factors like development, aging, inflammation, and cellular stress regulate the synthesis of lipid droplets. The biogenesis of lipid droplets has a critical role in reducing cellular stress. Lipid droplets, in response to stress, sequester hazardous lipids into their neutral lipid core, preserving energy and redox balance while guarding against lipotoxicity. Thus, the maintenance of lipid droplet homeostasis in adipose tissue, CNS, and other body tissues is essential for maintaining organismal health. Insulin resistance, hypertriglyceridemia, and lipid droplet accumulation are the severe metabolic abnormalities that accompany lipodystrophy-related fat deficit. Accumulation of lipid droplets is detected in almost all neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's, and Hereditary spastic paraplegia. Hence, the regulation of lipid droplets can be used as an alternative approach to the treatment of several diseases. The current review summarizes the structure, composition, biogenesis, and turnover of lipid droplets, with an emphasis on the factors responsible for the accumulation and importance of lipid droplets in lipodystrophy and neurodegenerative disease."

    "abstract": "Huntington's disease (HD) speech/language disorders have typically been attributed to motor and executive impairment due to striatal dysfunction. In-depth study of linguistic skills and the role of extrastriatal structures in HD is scarce. This study aimed to explore the profile of language compromise in HD and identify the structural neuroimaging correlates. Language and structural correlates were assessed using the Mini Linguistic State Examination (MLSE) in 81 participants (20 HD-ISS 0-1, 40 HD-ISS 2-3 and 21 controls). Clinical and global cognition measures were also obtained. Imaging data included computed gray matter volume (GMV) and cortical thickness (CTh) values extracted from a general linear model with the MLSE. Correlation analyses were performed with the language components of the MLSE. Multivariate regression analyses were used to explore the predictive ability of the language components on GMV and CTh loss. HD individuals showed impaired MLSE performance (84.5 ± 12.8), particularly in syntax, motor speech, and to a lesser extent, semantics and phonology. Significant associations were found between linguistic performance and the structural integrity of nodes within the temporo-parietal, fronto-parietal, and fronto-striatal lexical-semantic and syntactic networks. Correlation analyses linked motor speech and syntax with predominantly left fronto-striatal GMV and CTh clusters, while semantics had a bilateral fronto-parietal topography. Multivariate regression analyses showed language domains as independent contributing factors of GMV and CTh loss in classical language-related regions. Language impairment is an integral part of the HD cognitive phenotype, with severity associated with structural disintegration in extensive cortico-subcortical territories involved in language production and processing."

    "abstract": "Huntington's disease is a progressive, untreatable neurodegenerative disorder caused by a mutation in the Huntingtin gene. Next to neurodegeneration, altered immune activation is involved in disease progression. Since central nervous system inflammation and dysfunction of immune cells are recognized as driving characteristics, immunomodulation might represent an additional therapeutic strategy. Short-chain fatty acids were known to have immunomodulatory effects in neuroinflammatory diseases, such as multiple sclerosis. In this study, R6/2 mice were treated daily with 150 mM propionate. Survival range, body weight, and motor abilities were monitored. In striatal and cortical samples, neuronal survival was analyzed by immunofluorescence staining of NeuN-positive cells and expression levels of BDNF mRNA by real-time polymerase chain reaction. As inflammatory marker TNFα mRNA and IL-6 mRNA were quantified by rtPCR, iNOS-expressing cells were counted in immunologically stained brain slides. Microglial activation was evaluated by immunofluorescent staining of IBA1-positive cells and total IBA1 protein by Western Blot, in addition, SPI1 mRNA expression was quantified by rtPCR. Except for clasping behavior, propionate treatment did neither improve the clinical course nor mediated neuronal protection in R6/2 mice. Yet there was a mild anti-inflammatory effect in the CNS, with (i) reduction in SPI1-mRNA levels, (ii) reduced iNOS positive cells in the motor cortex, and (iii) normalized TNFα-mRNA in the motor cortex of propionate-treated R6/2 mice. Thus, Short-chain fatty acids, as an environmental factor in the diet, may slightly alleviate symptoms by down-regulating inflammatory factors in the central nervous system. However, they cannot prevent clinical disease progression or neuronal loss."

While IRFs are recognized for their regulatory functions in neuroinflammation, microglial activation, and neuronal survival, their dual roles as both drivers of pathological inflammation and mediators of neuroprotective pathways underscore a sophisticated regulatory paradox in neurodegenerative disorders. This review aims to synthesize current evidence on IRF-mediated neuroinflammation in AD and related diseases, focusing on the multifaceted functions of key IRF family members, including IRF1, IRF3, and IRF7. We critically evaluate their divergent roles: IRF1 and IRF3, for instance, exacerbate neuroinflammatory cascades and amyloid-beta (Aβ) pathology in AD, whereas IRF7 may paradoxically suppress inflammation under specific conditions. Additionally, we explore IRF dysregulation in Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Huntington's disease, emphasizing shared and distinct mechanisms across neurodegenerative disorders. Restoring IRF balance through genetic manipulation, small-molecule inhibitors, or microbiome-derived modulators could attenuate neuroinflammation, enhance Aβ clearance, and protect neuronal integrity. Ultimately, this work provides a framework for future research to harness IRF signaling pathways in the development of precision therapies for AD and other neurodegenerative diseases."

Data analysis was informed by interpretative phenomenological analysis. The analysis identified three themes related to the caregiver experience: The impact on the caregiver; The impact of the genetic risk; Accessing health care & support services. Complexities of caregiving are compounded by the lack of services available to Huntington's disease patients, as well as the lack of knowledge and expertise related to the disease.

However, long polyQ tracts are also found in many transcription factors (TFs), such as FOXP2, a TF implicated in human speech. Here, we explore how FOXP2 and other glutamine-rich TFs avoid unscheduled assembly. Throughout interphase, DNA binding, irrespective of sequence specificity, has a solubilizing effect. During mitosis, multiple phosphorylation events promote FOXP2's eviction from chromatin and supplant the solubilizing function of DNA. Further, human-specific amino acid substitutions linked to the evolution of speech map to a mitotic phospho-patch, the \"EVO patch,\" and reduce the propensity of the human FOXP2 to assemble. Fusing the pathogenic form of Huntingtin to either a DNA-binding domain, a phosphomimetic variant of this EVO patch, or a negatively charged peptide is sufficient to diminish assembly formation, suggesting that hijacking mechanisms governing solubility of glutamine-rich TFs may offer new strategies for treatment of polyQ expansion diseases."

Various molecular mechanisms, including disruptions in neurotrophins levels, are involved in the occurrence of memory problems in HD. Alpha-pinene (APN), a member of the monoterpene family, exhibited beneficial effects in animal models of neurodegenerative disorders. As a result, this study assessed the impact of APN on memory in the 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NP) induced model of HD in rats. Male Wistar rats received saline, 3-NP to model HD, or APN (1, 5, or 10 mg/kg) plus 3-NP for 21 days to assess APN's effects. Working and spatial memory were examined by the Y-maze and Morris-water-maze (MWM) tests. The mRNA levels of neurotrophins and their receptors in the brain cortex and hippocampus of the rats were quantitatively assessed through Reverse Transcription Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR) analysis. The results showed that APN, at all three doses, significantly prevented the disease phenotype induced by 3-NP administration. In addition, APN treatment elevated the gene expression levels of BDNF, TrkA, TrkB, and CREB, while significantly decreasing P75 NTR showing a dose-dependent effect in the brain cortex and hippocampus, compared to the 3-NP group. These findings suggest that APN alleviates 3-NP-induced memory deficits by enhancing neurotrophins and their receptor levels in an animal model of HD."

Neurological changes within the central nervous system, specifically the brain, include cell loss and deterioration that impact motor function, memory, executive function, and mood. Available treatments are limited and often only address symptomatic manifestations of the disease rather than disease progression. Cell transplantation therapy has shown promise for treating neurodegenerative diseases, but a source of autologous cells is required. Blastocyst complementation provides an innovative method for generating those autologous neural cells. By injecting mouse induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) into a wild type (WT) mouse blastocyst, we generated a chimeric mouse brain derived of both donor and host neuronal and non-neuronal cells. An embryonic day 12.5 (E12.5), automated image analysis of mouse-mouse chimeric brains showed the presence of GFP-labeled donor-derived dopaminergic and serotonergic neuronal precursors. GFP-labeled donor-derived cholinergic precursor neurons and non-neuronal microglia-like and macrophage-like cells were also observed using more conventional imaging analysis software. This work demonstrates that the generation of mouse-mouse chimeric neural cells is possible; and that characterization of early neuronal and non-neuronal precursors provides a first step towards utilizing these cells for cell transplantation therapies for neurodegenerative diseases."

Since aggregated proteins can cause cellular stress and cytotoxicity, there is an interest in the development of small molecule aggregation inhibitors as potential modulators of HD pathogenesis. Here, we study how a polyphenol modulates the aggregation mechanism of huntingtin exon 1 (HttEx1) even at sub-stoichiometric ratios. Sub-stoichiometric amounts of curcumin impacted the primary and/or secondary nucleation events, extending the pre-aggregation lag phase. Remarkably, the disrupted aggregation process changed both the aggregate structure and its cell metabolic properties. When administered to neuronal cells, the 'break-through' protein aggregates induced significantly reduced cellular stress compared to aggregates formed in absence of inhibitors. Structural analysis by electron microscopy, small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and solid-state NMR spectroscopy identified changes in the fibril structures, probing the flanking domains in the fuzzy coat and the fibril core. We propose that changes in the latter relate to the presence or absence of polyglutamine (polyQ) β-hairpin structures.

Characterized by progressive neuronal loss, these diseases lead to cognitive, motor, and behavioral impairments, significantly impacting patients' quality of life. Current therapies largely address symptoms without halting disease progression, underscoring the need for innovative, disease-modifying treatments. Ginseng, a traditional herbal medicine with well-known adaptogenic and neuroprotective properties, has gained attention as a potential therapeutic agent for neurodegeneration. Rich in bioactive compounds called ginsenosides, ginseng exhibits antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic effects, making it a promising candidate for addressing the complex pathology of neurodegenerative diseases. Recent studies demonstrate that ginsenosides modulate disease-related processes such as oxidative stress, protein aggregation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and inflammation. In AD models, ginsenosides have been shown to reduce amyloid-beta accumulation and tau hyperphosphorylation, while in PD, they help protect dopaminergic neurons and mitigate motor symptoms. Ginseng's effects in ALS, MS, and HD models include improving motor function, extending neuronal survival, and reducing cellular toxicity. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the neuroprotective mechanisms of ginseng, emphasizing its therapeutic potential across various neurodegenerative diseases and discussing future research directions for its integration into clinical practice."

The molecular mechanisms underlying 3-NP-induced neuronal death involve mitochondrial dysfunction, transcriptional dysregulation, and impaired antioxidant defense systems. This study investigated the effects of thymoquinone (TQ) encapsulated in solid lipid nanoparticles (NanoTQ), on mitochondrial biogenesis in 3-NP-induced neurotoxicity in the striatum of male Wistar rats. Systemic administration of 3-NP (10 mg/kg) for 14 days inhibited mitochondrial complex enzymes and increased mitochondrial membrane permeability in the striatum. 3-NP exposure significantly altered the translational level of PGC-1α by modifying the expression of p-CREB/TORC1/SIRT1/PPARγ. Additionally, 3-NP exposure significantly reduced striatal levels of BDNF, GDNF, and their downstream effectors. Treatment with NanoTQ (10 and 20 mg/kg) and TQ (80 mg/kg) significantly (P < 0.01) increased mitochondrial complex enzyme activity compared to TQ (40 mg/kg). NanoTQ also significantly (P < 0.01) regulated the expression of regulatory proteins, promoting PGC-1α mediated mitochondrial biogenesis. Furthermore, NanoTQ restored BDNF and GDNF signaling and enhanced the antioxidant defense mechanism by increasing Nrf-2 and HO-1 expression while reducing Keap1 levels in the striatum. In conclusion, NanoTQ effectively mitigated 3-NP-induced neurotoxicity by regulating the mitochondrial biogenesis, neurotrophic factors, and antioxidant defense system, thereby preventing HD-like symptoms in rats."

We measured arthritis, depression, diabetes, hypertension, and ischemic heart disease. We also evaluated whether patients who were dropped from physician panels found alternative sources of primary care. Hospital-employed physicians treated patients of similar or better health; for instance, 54% of integrated physicians' patients had 2 or more chronic conditions compared with 56% among independent physicians (P < .001). After becoming hospital employees, physicians treated approximately 10% fewer Medicare patients (-9.5%; 95% CI, -11.3% to -7.7%). Within physician panels, the prevalence of patients with 2 or more chronic conditions did not significantly change after employment relative to independent physicians (-1.1%; 95% CI, -2.3% to 0.2%). Approximately 37% of patients were dropped from physician panels after employment; these patients were less likely to find alternative primary care compared with those dropped from independent physician panels (P < .001). Hospital employment of physicians resulted in neither a higher number nor a higher proportion of complex patients treated by integrated physicians, at least among traditional Medicare patients."

    "title": "Sleep abnormalities are associated with greater cognitive deficits and disease activity in Huntington's disease: a 12-year polysomnographic study.",
    "abstract": "Increasing evidence suggests that the sleep pathology associated with neurodegenerative diseases can in turn exacerbate both the cognitive deficits and underlying pathobiology of these conditions. Treating sleep may therefore bear significant, even disease-modifying, potential for these conditions, but how best and when to do so remains undetermined. Huntington's disease, by virtue of being an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease presenting in mid-life, presents a key 'model' condition through which to advance this field. To date, however, there has been no clinical longitudinal study of sleep abnormalities in Huntington's disease and no robust interrogation of their association with disease onset, cognitive deficits and markers of disease activity. Here, we present the first such study. Huntington's disease gene carriers (<i>n</i> = 28) and age- and sex-matched controls (<i>n</i> = 21) were studied at baseline and 10- and 12-year follow-up. All Huntington's disease gene carriers were premanifest at baseline and were stratified at follow-up into 'prodromal/manifest' versus 'premanifest' groups. Objective sleep abnormalities were assessed through two-night inpatient polysomnography and 2-week domiciliary actigraphy, and their association was explored against Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Trail A/B task, Symbol Digit Modalities Task (SDMT), Hopkins Verbal Learning Task (HVLT) and Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) scores, plus serum neurofilament light levels. Statistical analysis incorporated cross-sectional ANOVA, longitudinal repeated measures linear models and regressions adjusted for multiple confounders including disease stage. Fifteen Huntington's disease gene carriers phenoconverted to prodromal/early manifest Huntington's disease by study completion. At follow-up, these gene carriers showed more frequent sleep stage changes (<i>P</i> ≤ 0.001, η<sub>p</sub> <sup>2</sup> = 0.62) and higher levels of sleep maintenance insomnia (defined by wake after sleep onset, <i>P</i> = 0.002, η<sub>p</sub> <sup>2</sup> = 0.52). The latter finding was corroborated by nocturnal motor activity patterns on follow-up actigraphy (<i>P</i> = 0.004, η<sub>p</sub> <sup>2</sup> = 0.32). Greater sleep maintenance insomnia was associated with greater cognitive deficits (Trail A <i>P</i> ≤ 0.001, <i>R</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0.78; SDMT <i>P</i> = 0.008, <i>R</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0.63; Trail B <i>P</i> = 0.013, <i>R</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0.60) and higher levels of neurofilament light (<i>P</i> = 0.015, <i>R</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0.39). Longitudinal modelling suggested that sleep stage instability accrues from the early premanifest phase, whereas sleep maintenance insomnia emerges closer to phenoconversion. Baseline sleep stage instability was able to discriminate those who phenoconverted within the study period from those who remained premanifest (area under curve = 0.81, <i>P</i> = 0.024). These results demonstrate that the key sleep abnormalities of premanifest/early Huntington's disease are sleep stage instability and sleep maintenance insomnia and suggest that the former bears value in predicting disease onset, while the latter is associated with greater disease activity and cognitive deficits. Intervention studies to interrogate causation within this association could not only benefit patients with Huntington's disease but also help provide fundamental proof-of-concept findings for the wider sleep-neurodegeneration field."

    "title": "Effect of stress on neuronal cell: Morphological to molecular approach.",
    "abstract": "Stress can be characterized as any perceived or actual threat that necessitates compensatory actions to maintain homeostasis. It can alter an organism's behavior over time by permanently altering the composition and functionality of brain circuitry. The amygdala and prefrontal cortex are two interrelated brain regions that have been the focus of initial research on stress and brain structural and functional plasticity, with the hippocampus serving as the entry point for most of this knowledge. Prolonged stress causes significant morphological alterations in important brain regions such as the hippocampus, amygdala, and prefrontal cortex. Memory, learning, and emotional regulation are among the cognitive functions that are adversely affected by these changes, including neuronal shrinkage, dendritic retraction, and synaptic malfunction. Stress perturbs the equilibrium of neurotransmitters, neuronal plasticity, and mitochondrial function at the molecular level. On the other hand, chronic stress negatively impacts physiology and can result in neuropsychiatric diseases. Recent molecular research has linked various epigenetic processes, such as DNA methylation, histone modifications, and noncoding RNAs, to the dysregulation of genes in the impacted brain circuits responsible for the pathophysiology of chronic stress. Numerous disorders, including neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) including Alzheimer's, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Friedreich's ataxia, Huntington's disease, multiple sclerosis, and Parkinson's disease, have been linked to oxidative stress as a possible cause."

    "abstract": "BackgroundHuntington's disease is a progressive, autosomal dominant, neurodegenerative disease caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the HTT gene. Medium spiny neurons of the striatum are especially vulnerable to the disease, and atrophy of the caudate and putamen can be documented by neuroimaging years before the onset of symptoms.ObjectiveIn this study, we aimed to characterize region-specific gray and white matter differences between Huntington's disease patients and controls.MethodsWe conducted a postmortem MRI study of the brains of 15 adults diagnosed with symptomatic Huntington's disease and 26 control subjects, aiming to compare the differences in regional grey and white matter volumes between the two groups.ResultsThe study revealed decreased volumes in both grey and white matter in patients with Huntington's disease, with the largest effect sizes observed in caudate and putamen. Notably, the atrophy predominantly affected the left hemisphere, particularly impacting grey and white matter regions adjacent to the pars opercularis, precentral, supramarginal, and pars orbitalis gyri, and the lateral orbitofrontal cortex. In the control group, asymmetry stems from larger left hemisphere regions compared to right, whereas an opposite pattern is observed in the Huntington's disease group.ConclusionsThese results suggest progressive, diffuse, and asymmetric grey and white matter atrophy occurs in Huntington's disease. The reasons for this asymmetry remain unknown; however, our study provides a more detailed characterization of previously reported grey and white matter changes in Huntington's disease, as observed through postmortem histopathological and MRI studies."

    "title": "Nicotinamide N-methyltransferase as a potential therapeutic target for neurodegenerative disorders: Mechanisms, challenges, and future directions.",
    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and Huntington's disease (HD), are characterized by progressive neuronal loss and functional decline, posing significant global health challenges. Emerging evidence highlights nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT), a cytosolic enzyme regulating nicotinamide (NAM) methylation, as a pivotal player in NDs through its dual impact on epigenetic regulation and metabolic homeostasis. This review synthesizes current knowledge on NNMT's role in disease pathogenesis, focusing on its epigenetic modulation via DNA hypomethylation and histone modifications, alongside its disruption of NAD<sup>+</sup> synthesis and homocysteine (Hcy) metabolism. Elevated NNMT activity depletes NAD<sup>+</sup>, exacerbating mitochondrial dysfunction and impairing energy metabolism, while increased Hcy levels drive oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and aberrant protein aggregation (e.g., Aβ, tau, α-synuclein). Notably, NNMT overexpression in AD and PD correlates with neuronal hypomethylation and neurotoxicity, as observed in postmortem brain studies and transgenic models. Mechanistically, NNMT consumes S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), limiting methyl donor availability for DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) and histone methyltransferases (HMTs), thereby altering gene expression patterns critical for neuronal survival. Concurrently, NNMT-mediated NAD<sup>+</sup> depletion disrupts sirtuin activity (e.g., SIRT1) and mitochondrial biogenesis, accelerating axonal degeneration. Therapeutic strategies targeting NNMT, such as RNA interference (RNAi), small-molecule inhibitors and exercise therapy, show promise in preclinical models by restoring NAD<sup>+</sup> levels and reducing Hcy toxicity. However, challenges persist in achieving cellular specificity, optimizing blood-brain barrier penetration, and mitigating off-target effects. This review underscores NNMT's potential as a multifactorial therapeutic target, bridging metabolic and epigenetic dysregulation in NDs. Future research should prioritize elucidating tissue-specific NNMT interactions, refining inhibitor pharmacokinetics, and validating translational efficacy in clinical trials. Addressing these gaps could pave the way for novel disease-modifying therapies to combat the rising burden of neurodegeneration."

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by selective loss of neurons. Cell replacement therapies are the most promising therapeutic strategies to restore the neuronal functions lost during these neurodegenerative processes. However, cell replacement-based clinical trials for Huntington's (HD) and Parkinson's diseases (PD) failed due to the large heterogeneity of the samples. Here, we identify CD200 as a cell surface marker for human striatal neuroblasts (NBs) using massively parallel single-cell RNA sequencing. Next, we set up a CD200-based immunomagnetic sorting pipeline that allows high-yield enrichment of human striatal NBs from in vitro differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). We also show that sorted CD200-positive cells are striatal projection neuron (SPN)-committed NBs which survive upon intra-striatal transplantation in adult mice with no evidence of graft overgrowth in vivo. In conclusion, we implemented a new CD200 cell selection strategy that reduces the heterogeneity and batch-to-batch variation and potentially decreases the teratogenic risk of hPSC-based cell therapy for neurodegenerative diseases."

    "title": "Investigating the Therapeutic Potential of the Ketogenic Diet in Modulating Neurodegenerative Pathophysiology: An Interdisciplinary Approach.",
    "abstract": "The ketogenic diet (KD) is a dietary intervention comprising a high-fat, low-carbohydrate, and moderate-protein intake designed to induce a metabolic state known as ketosis, whereby ketone bodies are produced as an alternative source of energy. Initially established as a treatment for intractable epilepsy, the KD has subsequently gained significant attention for its potential to manage neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's disease. Ketone bodies, such as beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), have been demonstrated to possess neuroprotective properties. The increasing prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's disease, poses a significant public health challenge worldwide. With neurological disorders being the second-leading cause of death globally, the need for effective therapeutic interventions has never been more urgent. Recent evidence suggests that dietary interventions, particularly the ketogenic diet, offer promising potential in mitigating the progression of these diseases by influencing metabolic processes and providing neuroprotective benefits. The ketogenic diet, characterized by high-fat and low-carbohydrate intake, induces ketosis, leading to the production of ketone bodies like beta-hydroxybutyrate, which enhance mitochondrial efficiency, reduce oxidative stress, and modulate inflammatory pathways-mechanisms critical in neurodegenerative pathophysiology. This review explores the role of the ketogenic diet in managing neurological conditions, examining its mechanisms of action, historical context, and therapeutic efficacy. The paper also discusses emerging evidence linking the ketogenic diet to improved cognitive function, reduced motor symptoms, and enhanced mitochondrial activity in patients with neurodegenerative disorders. Additionally, the review highlights the need for further research to refine the therapeutic applications of the ketogenic diet, investigate its impact on various neurodegenerative diseases, and better understand its potential long-term effects. This study underscores the importance of nutrition as a vital aspect of the treatment strategy for neurological diseases, advocating for continued exploration of dietary interventions to improve brain health and function."

    "abstract": "Huntington's disease (HD) is a rare dominantly inheritable autosomal neurodegenerative disease with unclear pathophysiological pathways. In neurodegenerative disorders, including HD, necroptosis plays a significant role in neuronal death. Morin hydrate (MH), a natural bioactive flavonoid, has various pharmacological properties via orchestrating neuroinflammation, apoptosis, and necroptosis. Up to now, there is no extant data on the impact of MH on the necroptotic pathway in HD. This research aimed to scrutinize the effect of MH on neurodegeneration initiated by 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NP) administration in rats via modulating necroptosis and apoptosis signaling pathways and compare it with necrosulfonamide (NSA) as a necroptosis inhibitor. HD was triggered in male wistar rats by intraperitoneal injection of 3-NP (10 mg/kg/day) for 14 days. Intraperitoneal injection of MH (20 mg/kg/day, i.p.) or NSA (1.65 mg/kg/day, i.p.) an hour prior to 3-NP administration for 14 days. At the end of study, rats were weighed, and their locomotor activity was assessed via grip strength and open field tests. Striata of rats were investigated histologically and immunohistochemically by evaluation the expression levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Striatal tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), caspase 3, and 8 levels were quantified through the ELISA technique, while striatal expression of necroptosis-associated proteins; phosphorylated form of receptor interacting protein kinase 1/3(p-RIPK1, p-RIPK3) and phosphorylated form of mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (p-MLKL) were assessed by the Western blot technique. Striatal succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) activity was assayed colorimetrically. Finally, gene enrichment analysis using ShinyGO was employed. MH and NSA significantly mitigated body weight loss and ameliorated locomotor deterioration, besides reversing histological abnormalities in the striatum of rats. Intriguingly, MH exerted similar effects on specific biomarkers and molecular signals as NSA. MH and NSA inhibited neuroinflammation, apoptosis, and necroptosis by significantly decreasing the striatal (TNF-α), caspase 3, and necroptosis-associated proteins (P-RIPK1, P-RIPK3, and P-MLKL) levels. Besides, MH and NSA also decreased striatal GFAP and increased SDH activity. Gene enrichment analysis revealed a significant interaction between genes. Together, MH exerts a neuroprotective action on 3-NP-elicited HD rats via reducing neuroinflammation, apoptosis, and necroptosis. This study highlights MH as a potential protection against HD, calling for further research to confirm its neuroprotective effects."

These models are sufficient to predict all structural characteristics of the energy landscape, where the use of explicit-solvent simulations has allowed for precise calibration of energetics and kinetics.

The Huntington's Disease Digital Motor progression Score (HDDMS), co-designed by people with HD and neurologists, is a composite score for measuring motor progression of HD in clinical research. It is derived from smartphone sensor-based motor tests included in a remote HD digital monitoring platform. Developing the HDDMS involved selecting features that quantify test performance according to desired measurement properties and combining these features in a weighted composite score using factor analysis. It was developed and subsequently validated using data from four separate studies (HD Natural History Study [NCT03664804], open-label extension [OLE] of the tominersen Phase I/IIa study [NCT03342053], GENERATION HD1 [NCT03761849], and Digital-HD). Based on data from 1,008 individuals, the HDDMS encompasses balance, chorea, speeded tapping, and gait. It has favourable characteristics, including reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient > 0.95), correlation with the composite Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (cUHDRS) (r = -0.5), and better sensitivity to change (STC) than the cUHDRS. In a post-hoc analysis of GENERATION HD1, the STC of HDDMS at Week 20 was comparable to that of the cUHDRS at Week 68. The HDDMS promises substantial reduction in sample size in clinical trials."

To establish an international consensus on the definition of primary colon cancer segment locations. Between December 2022 and June 2023, the Delphi survey study was conducted to seek opinions from relevant international experts and eventually develop a consensus definition of each colon cancer segment. Three-round online-based Delphi survey study. The online survey included 17 questions. In the first 2 rounds, participating experts were asked to rank each statement on a scale of 1 (least relevant) to 9 (most relevant). Consensus statements and definitions were revised according to the results for statements obtaining a consensus score of 7 to 9. During the third round and online meeting, definitions and statements that reached a moderate or high consensus (above 4 for more than 70% of participants) were included. The primary goal of our project was focused on precisely localizing the specific segment affected by primary colon cancer rather than identifying surgical treatment or type of resection needed for a particular segment. The first round included 331 experts; 301 (91%) completed the second round and 295 (98%) completed the final round. Experts strongly supported the use of a \"10-cm rule\" to describe colon cancer sites at the flexures and anatomical landmarks for other segments. Regarding the definition of rectosigmoid cancer, experts from United States and Europe reached a high consensus that the term rectosigmoid as a colon cancer location must be abolished in contrast to experts from Asia. The description of overlapping segments of cancers achieved a consensus of 64%. Subjective decisions are based on individual expert clinical experience. This Delphi survey, the first internationally conducted consensus study, achieved a remarkable level of consensus among a panel of global experts. Ambiguity still exists regarding overlapping lesions. See Video Abstract .

This brief review paper summarises the major findings of social cognitive research conducted in various hypo- and hyper-kinetic movement disorders (Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease and Tourette syndrome), with a focus on findings that may shed new light on the functions of the basal ganglia.<i>Results:</i> Task impairments include more predictable difficulties with embodied processes involving the motor system, such as problems with facial expressions and other non-verbal gestures. The cognitive and emotional changes associated with broader frontostriatal dysfunction may also explain some deficits, particularly difficulties with verbal tasks or perspective taking, with impacts varying according to the type of disorder and disease stage. Most intriguingly, transdiagnostic comparisons reveal patterns implying that the role of the basal ganglia in social cognition may be more important than previously recognised.<i>Conclusions:</i> Movement disorders show remarkable overlap in terms of atypical intention attribution across various tasks, as well as relationships between social cognition and behavioural or motivational symptoms (e.g., apathy; anhedonia; impulsivity). The possible mechanisms underlying these similarities are explored with a view to guiding future research."

Dentists often report that few protocols exist and there is a lack of understanding on how to manage these patients in the dental office. The aim of this review is to discuss the etiology and pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and management of this condition primarily from the dental perspective. A detailed literature review was conducted including articles searched on PubMed and Google Scholar using relevant keywords. Inclusion criteria prioritized studies based on relevance to oral care and HD with topics including caregiver-assisted oral hygiene, fluoride, dental preventative approaches, and case studies. Research reveals the significant oral health issues patients with HD suffer from including dysphagia, xerostomia, and a high caries risk. Studies illustrate the need for tailored care emphasizing long term treatment planning, preventive, and clinically relevant approaches. This review presents the importance of a proactive, multidisciplinary strategy to dental care in HD patients. Early preventive strategies can greatly postpone the decline of oral health in this population. Future studies should focus on a conclusive dental care guideline, caregiver education initiatives, and improving access to care in this patient population."

    "abstract": "Introduction Carcinoid syndrome (CS) represents the most common functional syndrome in patients with neuroendocrine tumors which may be in an advanced tumor state. The pathophysiology of congestive heart failure (CHF) and arrhythmia in CS is poorly understood; however, chronic exposure to excessive circulating serotonin is considered one of the most important factors contributing to increased morbidity and mortality in this population. Despite recognition, international consensus guidelines specifically addressing the diagnosis and management of CHF and arrhythmia in CS are lacking. This study focused on hospitalized patients once they represent more severe disease states requiring intensive management, thereby providing a clearer understanding of factors influencing adverse clinical outcomes. Methods This retrospective cohort study utilized the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project National Inpatient Sample to identify predictors of congestive heart failure and arrhythmia in hospitalized CS patients from 2016 to 2018. Results Initially, a total of 1,859 patients were included. After stratification, 606 patients had CHF and arrhythmia diagnosis with variables analyzed using multivariate logistic regression. Among 606 patients, 360 had CHF with advanced age, male sex, non-Hispanic Black race, Medicare insurance, and prolonged hospital stays, all of which were identified as significant predictors. Similarly, 246 patients diagnosed with arrhythmias were more prevalent in older and male patients and were associated with increased mortality and prolonged hospitalization. Conclusion These results highlight critical patient-related factors influencing mortality in CS patients with CHF and arrhythmia. Strategies aimed at early recognition, including clinical scoring systems, and biomarker assessment, could improve risk stratification and patient outcomes. Our findings underscore the importance of early risk stratification and targeted interventions to mitigate cardiac complications in CS patients. Additionally, incorporating our data into clinical practice has the potential to improve early recognition, promoting timely interventions for CS patients with CFH and arrhythmia. Developing consensus guidelines for managing CS-related cardiac complications, based on these insights, will further standardize care and improve patient outcomes."

    "abstract": "While progressive striatal gene expression changes and epigenetic alterations are a prominent feature of Huntington's disease (HD), the mechanistic basis remains poorly understood. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing (ChIP-seq), we show that the huntingtin protein (HTT) reproducibly occupies specific locations in the mouse genome. Striatal HTT ChIP-seq peaks were enriched in coding regions of spiny projection neuron identity genes that were found to have reduced expression in HD patients and mouse models, and had reduced occupancy in expanded polyglutamine HTT knock-in mice (HttQ111/Q111). By contrast, HTT occupancy was depleted near genes that are upregulated in HD. ChIP-seq of striatal histone modifications revealed genotype-specific colocalization of HTT with active chromatin marks and enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), a key enzymatic component of the PRC2 complex. In the vicinity of genes that are differentially regulated in HD, greater HTT occupancy in HttQ111/Q111 vs wild-type mice was associated with increased EZH2 occupancy, increased H3K4me3 levels and decreased H3K27me3 levels. Our study suggests that HTT-chromatin interactions may play a role in organizing chromatin and promoting cell type-specific gene expression, with HTT occupancy predicting transcriptional dysregulation in HD."

    "abstract": "Protein Kinase R is an essential regulator of many cell activities and belongs to one of the largest and most functionally complex gene families. These are found all over the body, and by adding phosphate groups to the substrate proteins, they regulate their activity and coordinate the action of almost all cellular processes. Recent research has illuminated the involvement of PKR in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders (NDs), thereby expanding our understanding of intricate molecular mechanisms underlying disease progression. Through their inhibition or activation, they hold potential therapeutic targets for the pathogenesis or protection of NDs. In the case of AD (AD), PKR contributes to the protection or elevation of Aβ accumulation, neuroinflammation, synaptic plasticity alterations, and neuronal excitability. Similarly, in Parkinson's disease (PD), PKR again has a dual role in dopaminergic neuronal loss, gene mutations, and mitochondrial dysfunction via various pathways. Notably, neuronal excitotoxicity, as well as genetic mutations, have been linked to ALS. In Huntington's disease (HD), PKR is associated with decreased or increased mutated genes, striatal neuron degeneration, neuroinflammation, and excitotoxicity. This review emphasizes strategies that target PKR for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders. Doing so offers valuable insights that can guide future research endeavors and the development of innovative therapeutic approaches."

    "title": "Structural and functional neuroplasticity in music and dance-based rehabilitation: a systematic review.",
    "abstract": "Music- and dance-based rehabilitation has gained prominence in promoting social engagement and improving motor, cognitive, and mood domains in individuals affected by different neurological disorders. This systematic review aims to synthesize existing evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating neuroimaging-based structural and functional neuroplasticity following music- and dance-based interventions among people with neurological disorders. Literature research was performed using PubMed (MEDLINE), Scopus, and Web of Science (WOS). A multidimensional approach was employed to assess the efficacy of music- and dance-based interventions, integrating neuroimaging and clinical assessments. Out of a total of 2247 papers reviewed, 20 RCTs met the inclusion criteria for this review, with a total of 718 subjects. Among them, 88% underwent a neuroimaging investigation to evaluate structural or functional neuroplasticity. Six studies involved dance-based interventions, while 14 examined music-based rehabilitation. These interventions targeted cognitive, motor, and mood impairments in people at risk of dementia or with neurological disorders including Huntington's Disease, stroke, traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, and disorder of consciousness. Overall, the selected studies demonstrated significant effects on behavioral and neuroimaging outcomes, showing structural and functional changes in critical areas for perception and memory in patients at risk of dementia, as well as in regions essential for language processing, emotional regulation, and motor control in patients with acute and chronic stroke. Nevertheless, several biases were identified, specifically related to neuroimaging biomarkers, such as a lack of baseline and between-group comparisons and a lack of prior registration of neuroimaging biomarkers investigated. The protocol of this review was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO), with registration number CRD42024574754."

    "title": "Mutant huntingtin induces neuronal apoptosis via derepressing the non-canonical poly(A) polymerase PAPD5.",
    "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that play crucial roles in post-transcriptional gene regulation. Poly(A) RNA polymerase D5 (PAPD5) catalyzes the addition of adenosine to the 3' end of miRNAs. In this study, we demonstrate that the Yin Yang 1 protein, a transcriptional repressor of PAPD5, is recruited to both RNA foci and protein aggregates, resulting in an upregulation of PAPD5 expression in Huntington's disease (HD). Additionally, we identify a subset of PAPD5-regulated miRNAs with increased adenylation and reduced expression in our disease model. We focus on miR-7-5p and find that its reduction causes the activation of the TAB2-mediated TAK1-MKK4-JNK pro-apoptotic pathway. This pathway is also activated in induced pluripotent stem cell-derived striatal neurons and post-mortem striatal tissues isolated from HD patients. In addition, we discover that a small molecule PAPD5 inhibitor, BCH001, can mitigate cell death and neurodegeneration in our disease models. This study highlights the importance of PAPD5-mediated miRNA dysfunction in HD pathogenesis and suggests a potential therapeutic direction for the disease."

    "abstract": "The aim was to investigate if glymphatic function is impaired in patients with Huntington's disease (HD) and its clinical relevance. Forty-nine subjects carrying mutant Huntingtin (mHTT), comprising 35 manifest (mHD) and 14 pre-manifest (PreHD), and 35 healthy controls (HC) were recruited in this study. The diffusion along perivascular spaces (ALPS) index and the percentage of perivascular space in the basal ganglia (pPVS_BG) were obtained in different groups. The discrimination effects of ALPS index were detected using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, and the correlations of ALPS index with clinical features of HD were further analyzed. ALPS index was decreased in mHTT carriers compared to HCs, and it was lower in mHD compared to PreHD patients. ROC analysis showed that the ALPS index could discriminate mHTT from HC (AUC [area under the curve] = 0.903), mHD from PreHD (AUC = 0.886), and PreHD from controls (AUC = 0.755). Lower ALPS index correlated with greater disease burden, severity of the disease, lager pPVS_BG, and lower brain volume and thickness of cortices. Regression analysis showed that ALPS index could predict the performance of motor and cognitive functions. Mediation analysis revealed that ALPS partially mediated the effects of CAG repeat and age on the cognitive decline in HD. This study demonstrated that the impairment of the glymphatic system, especially in the paraventricular white matter and BG, was correlated with the clinical manifestations, disease burden, and brain structural changes in mHTT carriers. © 2025 The Author(s).

    "abstract": "Huntington's disease (HD) is a challenging neurodegenerative disorder linked to Huntingtin (HTT) gene mutation, lacking an effective cure despite numerous therapeutic attempts. Cordyceps sinensis, recognized for its health benefits, particularly its constituent cordycepin, exhibits neuroprotective effects in various neurodegenerative diseases. However, the neuroprotective potential of cordycepin in HD remains insufficiently explored. In this study, in vitro experiments using HD cell models demonstrate that cordycepin treatment enhances cell survival, slightly diminishes mutant HTT aggregates, and improves neuronal formation. In vivo investigations on R6/2 HD transgenic mice reveal a modest increase in body weight and a slight amelioration in pathological aggregates following cordycepin administration, although behavioral changes are not significant. While the underlying mechanisms remain unexplored, the findings suggest cordycepin's promise as a supplementary therapeutic for HD, providing neuroprotective effects and reducing mutant protein aggregates."

    "abstract": "Rare neurological diseases (RNDs) result in severe health burdens worldwide. Data from China are limited. We aimed to investigate the health burden of 20 RNDs in Guangdong Province (GD), which contains two-thirds of the population of South China. The hospitalization data of 20 RNDs were described using hospital-based front sheet data from 3,037 hospitals of GD from 2016 to 2022. The 20 RNDs included amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease, cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy, congenital myotonia, congenital myasthenic syndrome, Dravet syndrome, Fabry disease, hereditary spastic paraplegia, Huntington disease, Leber hereditary optic neuropathy, mitochondrial encephalopathy (ME), multi-focal motor neuropathy, myotonic dystrophy, primary hereditary dystonia, progressive muscular dystrophy (PMD), spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy, spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), spinocerebellar ataxia, Wilson disease (WD) and X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy. Age were presented as mean and standard deviation while length of hospital stay as median and interquartile range (25th and 75th percentiles). The other variables were described as number and percentage. The data were analyzed by Joinpoint regression. There were 9,351 cases, including 330 ICU and 155 death cases. The average age was 33.7 ± 22.0 y, and 63.8% of patients were male. From 2016 to 2022, the number of RND (and juvenile RND) cases were 1034 (184), 1174 (293), 1443 (374), 1422 (320), 1331 (337), 1432 (409) to 1515 (515). ICU (and juvenile ICU) cases rose from 28 (3), 34 (6), 24 (4), 38 (11), 46 (13), 54 (24) to 106 (56). Joinpoint regression showed significant upward trend in percentages of juvenile and juvenile ICU cases (APC = 8.13, P< 0.05; APC = 28.42, P< 0.05). The fop five RNDs were WD, ASL, PMD, ME, and SMA, which accounted for 79.7% of all, 99.1% of ICU, and 94.8% of death cases. We demonstrated that the increase in health burden of RNDs was mainly evident in juveniles in South China from 2016 to 2022. The top 5 RNDs accounted for majority of the critical patients."

    "abstract": "Huntington's disease (HD) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized by the selective loss of neostriatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs). We previously found that intraventricular delivery of viral vectors expressing brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and Noggin induced heterotopic recruitment of new MSNs to the adult neostriatum and slowed disease progression in the R6/2 mouse model of HD. Nonetheless, the extent to which newly generated neurons integrate into adult striatal circuits has remained unclear. Here, using wild-type (WT) and R6/2 mice, we follow the fate of genetically tagged new neurons recruited to the striatum after intraventricular infusion of BDNF and Noggin. Using rabies tract tracing, optogenetics, and calcium imaging, we find that new neurons functionally assimilate into the cortico-striato-pallidal motor circuitry, and chemogenetic stimulation of these new neurons confirms their contribution to motor behavior. Together, these data indicate that induced neurogenesis may restore multi-synaptic circuits in the adult brain, offering a regenerative strategy for the treatment of HD."

    "title": "Drug Price and Health Policy Knowledge Influence Prescription Behavior in Orphan Diseases: Pheochromocytoma and Paraganglioma As Prototypes of Orphan Drug Econometrics.",
    "abstract": "Introduction Two federal drug policies, the Orphan Drug Act of 1983 (ODA) and the Unapproved Drug Initiative of 2006 (UDI), created market exclusivity and arbitrage opportunities in pharmaceutical pricing for two rare diseases, namely, pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma (PPGL). Historically, phenoxybenzamine and nitroprusside, amongst other medications, have been the first-line drugs for the perioperative and intraoperative management of patients undergoing PPGL resection. We aimed to assess the prescription behavior in perioperative pheochromocytoma management at an institution where providers have knowledge of orphan drug pricing. Methods We performed a retrospective cohort study of adult patients who underwent PPGL resection from January 2015 to September 2021. Patients in the study were seen at a tertiary academic medical center. 96 patients were included in this study and all patients underwent the standard University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) perioperative surgical and anesthetic management. We assessed incidence of phenoxybenzamine and nitroprusside utilization as a perioperative blockade and as an intraoperative vasodilator, respectively. Statistical comparison of drug utilization was performed using the Cochran-Armitage test. Results Between 2015 and 2021, six (86%), 15 (75%), six (35%), seven (64%), two (17%), five (42%), and two (12%) patients received phenoxybenzamine as perioperative blockade, respectively. Similarly, between 2015 and 2021, one (14%), five (25%), 11 (65%), four (36%), 10 (83%), seven (58%), and 15 (88%) patients received alpha-1 selective blockade as perioperative treatment, respectively. The inverse change in phenoxybenzamine and alpha-1-selective agent utilization was statistically significant (p < 0.0001). Between 2015 and 2021, four (57%), two (10%), one (6%), zero (0%), zero (0%), zero (0%), and zero (0%) patients received nitroprusside as an intraoperative vasodilator, respectively. Similarly, between 2015 and 2021, three (43%), 18 (90%), 16 (94%), 11 (100%), 12 (100%), 12 (100%), and 17 (100%) patients did not receive nitroprusside as an intraoperative vasodilator, respectively. The decreasing nitroprusside utilization was statistically significant (p = 0.0004). Conclusion From 2015 to 2021, in the setting of the UDI and ODA, utilization trends of perioperative phenoxybenzamine and intraoperative nitroprusside decreased among the 96 patients undergoing PPGL resection. This study illustrates that provider knowledge of drug price increases can drive prescription behavior change. Provider knowledge of drug econometrics in rare diseases provides a platform for value creation in care delivery."

    "abstract": "Genome editing, prominently led by the revolutionary CRISPR-Cas9 technology, is a powerful tool with significant applications in diverse fields, particularly in medicine and agriculture. It empowers scientists with the ability to effect precise genetic modifications, thereby potentially paving the way for advanced treatments for genetic disorders such as Huntington's disease, hemophilia, and cystic fibrosis. Yet, the significant capabilities of this technology also brings to the fore a myriad of intricate bioethical, legal, and regulatory dilemmas. In light of these complexities, this article endeavors to conduct a comprehensive scoping review of the existing literature on the most significant ethical implications emanating from genome editing. In conducting this review, we utilized the power of software tools like EndNote and Rayyan to aid in the systematic and thorough review of the literature. EndNote, a reference management software, was instrumental in organizing and managing the references and bibliographies, while Rayyan, a web application designed for managing and screening records for systematic and scoping reviews, proved crucial in the import and management of text records for the review.The review identified as main aspects of ethical, bioethical and medico-legal interest the exacerbation of social inequalities, safety concerns such as off-target mutations and immunological risks, ecological and evolutionary implications, and challenges to human dignity. It highlights the necessity for equitable access, rigorous regulation, and public engagement to address these issues responsibly.The ultimate objective of this article is to underscore the importance of an informed and inclusive dialogue regarding genome editing. Such dialogue is pivotal for fostering responsible innovation in this rapidly advancing field, ensuring that scientific progress aligns with ethical considerations. By presenting a comprehensive examination of the ethical implications of genome editing, we aim to contribute to this ongoing dialogue and promote a balanced and nuanced understanding of this impactful technology."

    "abstract": "Food Is Medicine interventions are increasingly gaining attention from policy makers, payers, and health care professionals as a promising approach to addressing diet-related chronic health conditions in the health care setting, given the increasing burden and cost of these conditions. The American Heart Association defines Food Is Medicine as the provision of healthy food such as medically tailored meals, medically tailored groceries, and produce prescriptions to treat or manage specific clinical conditions in a way that is integrated with and paid for by the health care sector. Importantly, Food Is Medicine is distinct from, yet complementary to, food and nutrition assistance programs and population-level healthy food policies and programs. In this article, we discuss the importance of this distinction and the prerequisites for successfully integrating Food Is Medicine interventions within the health care system: a standard definition of Food Is Medicine focused on medically tailored meals, medically tailored groceries, and produce prescriptions; a research base showing clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness; and implementation that ensures fidelity and quality."

    "title": "Alkaloids as neuroprotectors: targeting signaling pathways in neurodegenerative diseases.",
    "abstract": "Neurodegeneration is the progressive loss of neurons that results in neurodegenerative diseases (NDs). Currently, there are few effective treatments for NDs, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Multiple sclerosis, and Huntington's disease, which involve gradual neuronal death and cognitive deterioration. Alkaloids are naturally occurring molecules with a variety of biological properties. Recent studies have shown that these compounds may be able to modulate signaling pathways linked to many diseases. Alkaloids, with their antioxidant and neuroprotective properties, have the potential to treat neurodegeneration by simultaneously affecting multiple disease parts and modifying neuroinflammatory responses. These interact with various molecular targets, such as transcription factors, receptors, and enzymes involved in neuronal survival and homeostasis. The development of complete therapeutic techniques can be facilitated by alkaloid-based multi-target approaches, which challenge the intricate nature of neurodegenerative pathways. The review highlights the potential of alkaloid-based multi-target strategies in treating NDs and calls for further research to understand their clinical applications fully. Future studies should focus on finding neuroprotective alkaloids, investigating their mechanisms, and evaluating their therapeutic potential. Understanding how alkaloids interact with key pathways in NDs is essential for developing effective therapies."

    "abstract": "Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors represent a new generation of antihyperglycemic agents that operate through mechanisms distinct from conventional diabetes treatments. Beyond their metabolic effects, these medications have demonstrated neuroprotective properties in preclinical studies. While clinical trials have explored their therapeutic potential in established neurodegenerative conditions, their role in disease prevention remains unclear. We conducted a network meta-analysis (NMA) to comprehensively evaluate the prophylactic benefits of these agents across multiple neurodegenerative diseases and identify the most promising preventive strategies. We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, ClinicalKey, Cochrane CENTRAL, ProQuest, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, and ClinicalTrials.gov through October 24th, 2024, for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of GLP-1 receptor agonists or SGLT2 inhibitors. Our primary outcome was the incidence of seven major neurodegenerative diseases: Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Lewy body dementia, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal dementia, and Huntington's disease. Secondary outcomes included safety profiles assessed through dropout rates. We performed a frequentist-based NMA and evaluated risk of bias with Risk of Bias tool. The main result of the primary outcome in the current study would be re-affirmed via sensitivity test with Bayesian-based NMA. Our analysis encompassed 22 RCTs involving 138,282 participants (mean age 64.8 years, 36.4% female). Among all investigated medications, only dapagliflozin demonstrated significant prophylactic benefits, specifically in preventing Parkinson's disease (odds ratio = 0.28, 95% confidence intervals = 0.09 to 0.93) compared to controls. Neither GLP-1 receptor agonists nor other SGLT2 inhibitors showed significant preventive effects for any of the investigated neurodegenerative conditions. Drop-out rates were comparable across all treatments. This comprehensive NMA reveals a novel and specific prophylactic effect of dapagliflozin against Parkinson's disease, representing a potential breakthrough in preventive neurology. The specificity of dapagliflozin's protective effect to Parkinson's disease might rely on its highly selective inhibition to SGLT2. These findings provide important direction for future research and could inform preventive strategies for populations at risk of Parkinson's disease. PROSPERO CRD42021252381."

    "abstract": "It is anticipated that the prevalence of illnesses affecting the central nervous system (CNS) will rise significantly due to longer lifespans and changing demography. Age-related decline in brain function and neuronal death are features of neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, which provide formidable treatment challenges. Because most therapeutic drugs cannot across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) to reach the brain, there are still few treatment alternatives available despite a great deal of research. This study explores the role of redox chemical delivery systems in CNS drug delivery and addresses challenges associated with neurodegenerative disease (ND). Redox Chemical Delivery System offers a promising approach to enhancing leveraging redox reactions that facilitate the transport of therapeutic agents across the BBB. Through the optimization of medication delivery pathways to the brain, this technology has the potential to greatly improve the treatment of ND. As our understanding of the biological underpinnings of ND deepens, the potential for effective interventions increases. Refining drug delivery strategies, such as RCDS, is essential for advancing CNS therapies from research to clinical practice. These advancements could transform the management of ND, improving both treatment efficacy and patient outcomes."

    "title": "Activating autophagy to eliminate toxic protein aggregates with small molecules in neurodegenerative diseases.",
    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), such as Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, Huntington disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and frontotemporal dementia, are well known to pose formidable challenges for their treatment due to their intricate pathogenesis and substantial variability among patients, including differences in environmental exposures and genetic predispositions. One of the defining characteristics of NDs is widely reported to be the buildup of misfolded proteins. For example, Alzheimer disease is marked by amyloid beta and hyperphosphorylated Tau aggregates, whereas Parkinson disease exhibits α-synuclein aggregates. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia exhibit TAR DNA-binding protein 43, superoxide dismutase 1, and fused-in sarcoma protein aggregates, and Huntington disease involves mutant huntingtin and polyglutamine aggregates. These misfolded proteins are the key biomarkers of NDs and also serve as potential therapeutic targets, as they can be addressed through autophagy, a process that removes excess cellular inclusions to maintain homeostasis. Various forms of autophagy, including macroautophagy, chaperone-mediated autophagy, and microautophagy, hold a promise in eliminating toxic proteins implicated in NDs. In this review, we focus on elucidating the regulatory connections between autophagy and toxic proteins in NDs, summarizing the cause of the aggregates, exploring their impact on autophagy mechanisms, and discussing how autophagy can regulate toxic protein aggregation. Moreover, we underscore the activation of autophagy as a potential therapeutic strategy across different NDs and small molecules capable of activating autophagy pathways, such as rapamycin targeting the mTOR pathway to clear α-synuclein and Sertraline targeting the AMPK/mTOR/RPS6KB1 pathway to clear Tau, to further illustrate their potential in NDs' therapeutic intervention. Together, these findings would provide new insights into current research trends and propose small-molecule drugs targeting autophagy as promising potential strategies for the future ND therapies. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: This review provides an in-depth overview of the potential of activating autophagy to eliminate toxic protein aggregates in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. It also elucidates the fascinating interrelationships between toxic proteins and the process of autophagy of \"chasing and escaping\" phenomenon. Moreover, the review further discusses the progress utilizing small molecules to activate autophagy to improve the efficacy of therapies for neurodegenerative diseases by removing toxic protein aggregates."

    "abstract": "A trinucleotide repeat expansion of the JPH3 gene causes Huntington disease-like 2 (HDL2), clinically indistinguishable from Huntington's disease and is considered a disease unique to African and Afro-descendant populations. We identified five HDL2 families from the Costa Chica region of southern Pacific Mexico. Because the Mexican population is admixed, we aimed to determine the ancestral origin of the expansion and define the mutation-carrying haplotype using microarray genomic data. Sixteen individuals (Nine symptomatic, three asymptomatic mutation carriers and four healthy non-carriers) were included. Global and local ancestry were estimated using whole-genome microarray data. Principal component and quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA) were used to infer the most likely origin of the haplotypes, complemented by the SMOTE-Tomek sampling strategy. Mean ancestry proportions were 16.26, 27.33, and 56.39% for African, European, and Native American components, respectively. A 1.1 Mb segment inferred as African flanking the JPH3 mutation locus was shared by at least one of the homologous chromosomes of all mutation carriers. Phased genotype analysis revealed a common 746 Kb haplotype containing the mutation that includes 412 SNPs. This shared haplotype was consistently inferred to be of African origin. QDA classified this haplotype as Yoruba in 78.3% of the resampling iterations. Ancestry analysis suggests that the JPH3 repeat expansion identified in our patients is a founder mutation of African origin. Other founder mutations causing rare genetic diseases in Mexico show how the admixture process in Latin America has contributed to the high prevalence of disease in certain geographical regions."

Studies indicate that persons diagnosed with diabetes are more susceptible to late-onset AD. Diabetes manifests as insulin resistance, which can have significant effects on cognitive function and contribute to the development of AD. The CDC WONDER database was used to determine the crude death rates (CR) and age-adjusted mortality rates (AAMRs) per 100,000 individuals, 65 years and above. Joinpoint Regression Program was used to examine the changes in AAMR in the form of annual percent change (APC) and average annual percent change (AAPC). From 1999 to 2020, late-onset AD and diabetes were associated with 185,059 deaths in the older US population, demonstrating an increasing trend (AAPC = 2.87). Females (20.38) had higher AAMR than males (19.62). Non-Hispanic (NH) African Americans experienced the highest AAMR (28.01), while non-Hispanic Asians experienced the lowest (16.09). AAMRs varied by region (West: 23.53, Midwest: 21.51, South: 21.0, Northeast: 13.50). States with the highest AAMR percent change were Nebraska and Louisiana; those with the lowest were Montana and New Hampshire. Most deaths occurred at hospice/nursing facilities (57.96%). Non-metropolitan areas showed a higher mortality burden (25.05) than metropolitan areas (19.02).

ER stress pathway is implicated in pathophysiology of several neurodegenerative disorders, especially those classified as proteinopathies. Several traditional medicines are used to treat neurodegeneration and <i>Sida cordifolia</i> (SC) is one of the common ingredients in formulations used for treating NDs and neuropathic pain. However, the mode of action is not clear. We studied the effectiveness of SC in Huntington's Disease (HD) model using <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> and mammalian cells. We used a transgenic <i>C. elegans</i> that expresses mutant huntingtin protein tagged with Yellow Fluorescent Protein (YFP) in their body wall muscle. In <i>C. elegans</i>, SC not only improved motility but also substantially increased the life span. Cell-based studies using inducible mutant Huntingtin protein (mHTT) with a long polyQ tail tagged with EGFP showed that SC profoundly modulates ER stress, reducing the stress caused by mHTT protein. The study showed that the mode of action of SC, at least partially, is through modulation of ER stress pathway, thereby normalizing the changes brought about by overexpression of mHTT."

This study evaluated suicidal thoughts and sleep disturbances among PwHD in Europe and the United States using data from the Huntington's Disease Burden of Illness (HDBOI) study. The HDBOI study is a cross-sectional burden-of-illness study of PwHD in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Eligible participants were adults (18 years and older) with motor manifest Huntington disease (HD) ≥ 12 months before study recruitment.

Data were collected by the physician, and a voluntary questionnaire was completed by the PwHD or a caregiver. All findings were analyzed descriptively. Differences were assessed using analysis of variance or χ<sup>2</sup> tests. A total of 2,094 PwHD were included; 1,602 (77%) were from Europe and 492 (23%) were from the United States, with 846 (40%) with ES, 701 (33%) with MS, and 547 (26%) with AS HD. PwHD reported current (13%, n = 272) or previous (28%, n = 575) suicidal ideation, which was more common with advanced HD (ES, 11%; MS, 14%; AS, 15%; <i>p</i> < 0.05). Of 482 questionnaire respondents, 91% (n = 437) reported difficulty sleeping, which was more common with AS HD (<i>p</i> < 0.05; [<i>p</i> = 0.000]). The HDBOI study showed a substantial burden of suicidal ideation and sleep disturbances among PwHD, which tended to worsen with disease severity."

    "title": "Natural products in neurodegenerative diseases: recent advances and future outlook.",
    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's are on the rise and pose significant challenges due to the lack of effective treatments. This review critically examines the neuroprotective effects of various natural products derived from plants, marine organisms, and fungi. Natural products have long been used in traditional medicine and are gaining attention in modern drug discovery for their unique properties. The review explains how these natural products can protect neurons by influencing the key biological pathways involved in neurodegeneration. It discusses mechanisms including antioxidant effects, anti-inflammatory actions, modulation of cellular signalling, and support for mitochondrial function. A systematic literature search was conducted to minimize bias and ensure rigorous study selection. Preclinical studies using animal models and cell cultures show that secondary metabolites like polyphenols, alkaloids, and terpenoids can significantly reduce neuronal damage. Some clinical trials have shown promising results. However, challenges such as bioavailability, standardization, and dosage must be addressed to translate these findings into clinical practice. The review also evaluates the potential synergy of combining natural products with conventional treatments, offering a complementary therapeutic approach. Natural products represent a promising avenue for developing innovative treatments for neurodegenerative diseases. The review highlights key research gaps and proposes future directions. Future studies should focus on overcoming existing challenges and refining these natural products to improve their efficacy and safety in clinical settings. The application of existing knowledge has the potential to significantly enhance the quality of life for individuals affected by neurodegenerative diseases."

    "abstract": "A comprehensive, patient-centered conceptual model of early Parkinson's is lacking and is greatly needed. A systematic review and meta-synthesis of qualitative and quantitative research was conducted by a multi-stakeholder taskforce using JBI Mixed Methods Review criteria and GRADE-CERQual standards for assessment of evidence. Over 340 symptoms and impacts were identified across ten symptom domains (Movement, Cognitive, Psychiatric, Sleep, Sensory, Speech, Digestive, Urinary, Sexual, Autonomic) and two impact domains (Physical and Psychosocial functioning). A wide range of motor and non-motor symptoms were present in early disease, with strongest support for tremor, dexterity, gait, stiffness, slow movements, cognitive, mood, and sleep alterations, urinary dysfunction, constipation, pain, and fatigue. These affected mobility, self-concept, coping, effort of living, interactions and important activities, with evidence of many understudied concepts. This model offers the most comprehensive catalogue of symptoms and impacts in Parkinson's to date and will support clinical practice and endpoint selection for therapeutic trials."

    "abstract": "We recently showed that endometriotic peritoneal fluid (PF) altered the regulation of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) and H3K27me3. This study aimed to determine if PF by regulating EZH2/H3K27me3 modulated C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4), a major chemokine involved in the proliferation and migration processes in endometriosis. Endometriotic PF induced the mRNA expression of CXCR4 and EZH2 and protein expression of H3K27me3 in human endometrial stromal cells (hESCs) and eutopic endometrium (Eu). CXCR4 inhibitor, AMD3100, decreased the PF-induced expression of these factors and reduced migration, but increased the proliferation of hESCs. In contrast, the EZH2 inhibitor, GSK126, decreased the expression of EZH2 and H3K27me3 and reduced proliferation, but increased the expression of CXCR4 and migration of hESCs. A combination of both inhibitors decreased the expression of CXCR4, EZH2, and H3K27me3, as well as reduced cell proliferation and migration. Our study suggests that targeting both CXCR4 (inflammation) and EZH2 (epigenetics) may be a better alternative for women with endometriosis."

We explored the viability of this therapeutic strategy <i>in vivo</i> at the level of the reagent design, toxicity, systemic delivery, brain regions transduction, silencing efficiency, and allele preference. We designed a series of CAG-directed short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) based on a previous A2 reagent, allele selective <i>in vitro</i>. Humanized HD (Hu<sup>128Q/21Q</sup>) and SCA3 (Ki<sup>150Q/21Q</sup>) mice with mutant ∼100 CAGs and normal 21 CAGs alleles were used to simulate biallelic conditions occurring in patients. We administered AAV-PHP.eB shRNAs-encoding vectors into the blood as an equivalent of non-invasive CAG-directed brain-targeted therapy crossing the blood-brain barrier. We demonstrate that optimized CAG-targeted A4(P10) and A4(P10,11) shReagents can lower mutant huntingtin and ataxin-3 protein and its aggregates by targeting brain regions selectively and with diminished toxicity compared to other tested shRNAs. The important considerations of the approach are the silencing efficiency depending on the transduction region and careful dose adjustment. Moreover, the CAG approach could be suitable to target somatic expansion. Our work paves the way toward developing the therapy for polyQ diseases, potentially shortening drug development."

    "abstract": "Huntington's disease (HD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative disorder affecting an individual's cognitive and motor abilities. HD is caused by a mutation in the huntingtin gene producing a toxic polyglutamine-expanded protein (mHTT) and leading to degeneration in the striatum and cortex. Yet, the molecular signatures that underlie tissue-specific vulnerabilities remain unclear. Here, we investigate this aspect by leveraging multi-epitope protein interaction assays, subcellular fractionation, thermal proteome profiling, and genetic modifier assays. The use of human cell, mouse, and fly models afforded capture of distinct subcellular pools of epitope-enriched and tissue-dependent interactions linked to dysregulated cellular pathways and disease relevance. We established an HTT association with nearly all subunits of the transcriptional regulatory Mediator complex (20/26), with preferential enrichment of MED15 in the tail domain. Using HD and KO models, we find HTT modulates the subcellular localization and assembly of the Mediator. We demonstrated striatal enriched and functional interactions with regulators of calcium homeostasis and chromatin remodeling, whose disease relevance was supported by HD fly genetic modifiers assays. Altogether, we offer insights into tissue- and localization-dependent (m)HTT functions and pathobiology."

    "abstract": "Rare diseases are a diverse group of disorders that, despite each individual condition's rarity, collectively affect a significant portion of the global population. Currently approximately 10,000 rare diseases exist globally, with 80% of these diseases being identified as having genetic origins. In this Review, we examine data from the CAS Content Collection to summarize scientific progress in the area of rare diseases. We examine the publication landscape in the area in an effort to provide insights into current advances and developments. We then discuss the evolution of key concepts in the field, genetic associations, as well as the major technologies and development pipelines of rare disease treatments. We focus our attention on three specific rare diseases: (i) amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a terminal neurodegenerative disease affecting the central nervous system resulting in progressive loss of motor neurons that control voluntary muscles; (ii) Huntington's disease, another terminal neurodegenerative disease that causes progressive degeneration of nerve cells in the brain, with a wide impact on a person's functional abilities; and (iii) myasthenia gravis, a chronic autoimmune synaptopathy leading to skeletal muscle weakness. While the pathogenesis of these rare diseases is being elucidated, there is neither a cure nor preventative treatment available, only symptomatic treatment. The objective of the paper is to provide a broad overview of the evolving landscape of current knowledge on rare diseases and specifically on the biology and genetics of the three spotlighted diseases, to outline challenges and evaluate growth opportunities, an aim to further efforts in solving the remaining challenges."

Phenome-wide scans for genetic pleiotropy indicate substantial genetic correlations of DED with comorbidities, including fibromyalgia, post-traumatic stress disorder, and Sjögren's disease.

In this study, we have conducted a large meta-analysis of DNA methylation across multiple cortical brain regions, in relation to increasing burden of LB pathology. Utilizing a combined dataset of 1239 samples across 855 unique donors, we identified a set of 30 false discovery rate (FDR) significant loci that are differentially methylated in association with LB pathology, the most significant of which were located in <i>UBASH3B</i> and <i>PTAFR</i>, as well as an intergenic locus. Ontological enrichment analysis of our meta-analysis results highlights several neurologically relevant traits, including synaptic, inflammatory and vascular alterations. We leverage our summary statistics to compare DNA methylation signatures between different neurodegenerative pathologies and highlight a shared epigenetic profile across LB diseases, Alzheimer's disease and Huntington's disease, although the top-ranked loci show disease specificity. Finally, utilizing summary statistics from previous large-scale genome-wide association studies we report FDR significant enrichment of DNA methylation differences with respect to increasing LB pathology in the <i>SNCA</i> genomic region, a gene previously associated with Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies."

    "abstract": "Huntington's disease (HD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG-repeat expansion in exon-1 of the <i>huntingtin</i> gene. Currently, no disease-modifying therapies are available, with a significant challenge in evaluating therapeutic efficacy before clinical symptoms emerge. This highlights the need for early biomarkers and intervention strategies. Therefore, it is essential to develop and characterize accurate mouse models and identify early biomarkers for preclinical therapeutic development. In this study, we characterized the pathological progression of the heterozygous zQ175 neo-deleted knock in (zQ175DN) mouse model across four age groups: 3, 6, 10, and 16 months to identify human translatable outcome measures. T2-relaxation-under-spin-tagging (TRUST) MRI was used to assess global CMRO <sub>2</sub> , while T2-weighted MRI was used to analyze brain volumes. Significant brain volume loss was detected as early as 6 months of age, worsening progressively with age in the zQ175 DN mice, resembling HD brain volumetric changes. A decline in CMRO <sub>2</sub> was observed in 6-month-old zQ175 DN mice, with significant and progressive reductions in 10- and 16-months old HD mice. Additionally, PHP1-positive mutant huntingtin (mHTT) aggregates were present in the striatum of zQ175 DN mice at all four age groups, with intranuclear localization prior to 6 months, transitioning to both intranuclear and neuropil aggregates in older zQ175 DN mice, suggesting that the localization of mHTT aggregates may reflect the severity of HD pathogenesis. Interestingly, plasma neurofilament light chain (NfL) protein concentrations were significantly elevated at 6 months of age and older zQ175DN mice. These findings provide valuable insights for selecting outcome measures in preclinical evaluations of HD therapies using the zQ175 DN mouse model."

    "abstract": "Cell-cell communication underlies all emergent properties of the brain, including cognition, learning and memory. The physical basis for these communications is the synapse, a multi-component structure requiring coordinated interactions between diverse cell types. However, many aspects of three-dimensional (3D) synaptic organization remain poorly understood. Here, we developed an approach, seamless <i>in situ</i> trimming and milling (SISTM), to reliably fabricate sufficiently thin lamellae for mapping of the 3D nanoarchitecture of synapses in mouse, monkey and human brain tissue under near-native conditions via cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET). We validated SISTM in a mouse model of Huntington's disease, demonstrating distinct 3D alterations to synaptic vesicles and mitochondria. By successfully applying SISTM to macaque brain, we described the 3D architecture of a tripartite synapse within the cortex. Subtomogram averaging (STA) enabled spatial mapping of astrocyte-neuron contacts within the tripartite synapse, revealing neurexin-neuroligin complexes as potential constituents that tether the two cell types. Finally, we showed that the defining features of synaptic nanoarchitecture were conserved across species and evident in human brain tissue obtained postmortem. Combining SISTM with cryo-ET and STA is a starting point for a new understanding of brain organization, disease-induced structural alterations and the development of rational, structure-guided therapeutics."

    "abstract": "Data obtained from high throughput experiments often exhibit complex dependencies among features. These dependencies arise from various sources, including genetic correlation, batch effects, technical replicates, and shared biological pathways. Ignoring these dependencies can lead to inflated false discovery rate (FDR), reduced statistical power, and biased biological interpretations. Properly accounting for these dependencies is crucial for accurate detection of biological signals. We propose a new method called Analysis of Correlated Expressions (ACE) to compare the mean expression of features between two groups. ACE is based on a factor analytic model that accounts for dependence among features and also incorporates heterogeneity of variances between groups, a common feature of high throughput data. Furthermore, ACE does not require the data to be normally distributed. It is scalable and free of any unknown tuning parameters. Extensive simulation studies indicate that it is more powerful than many existing methods while controlling the FDR. Application of ACE to a microRNA dataset, a neuroblastoma gene expression dataset, and a Huntington's disease dataset resulted in some novel findings that were missed by existing methods."

AChE is an important biomarker for early diagnosis and treatment, including Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Huntington's disease (HD). Therefore, developing efficient and immediate sensing platforms for AChE detection is crucial for advancing early diagnostic tools. In this study, we developed a dual-mode colorimetric/photothermal sensing platform based on iodide ion-synergized covalent porphyrin-triazine backbone nanozymes (Zn-CTF/I) to detect AChE with high sensitivity and reliability. The synergistic interaction between iodide ions and zinc atoms effectively modulated the electronic structure of the catalytic active site, significantly enhancing the peroxidase-like (POD-like) activity of Zn-CTF/I. This enhancement led to a 10-fold reduction in the AChE detection limit compared to controls, with a minimum detection limit of 0.003 U L<sup>-1</sup>, outperforming other reported assays. The integration of temperature-based photothermal signals with colorimetric detection improved the platform's accuracy and reliability. The system also demonstrated excellent recovery performance in detecting AChE in complex serum samples. The proposed dual-mode sensing platform provides a sensitive, reliable, and robust tool for AChE detection, with promising applications in early diagnosis and treatment monitoring of neurodegenerative diseases."

NGF, a key signaling molecule, became the first identified neurotrophic factor, influencing the growth, differentiation, and survival of neurons in both peripheral and central nervous systems. NGF and related neurotrophic factors hold therapeutic potential for various neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, Huntington's Disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, spinal cord injuries, neuropathies, traumatic brain injuries, and stroke. However, despite promising in vitro studies and animal models findings, NGF efficacy in patients remains unproven. Indeed, its use as a therapeutic agent faces challenges in delivery and clinical translation. This review delves into these challenges, exploring ongoing research on refined delivery methods, dosages, and safety profiles. Innovative strategies, including molecular mimicking, combination therapies, gene therapy, and coupling with neuromodulation techniques like transcranial magnetic stimulation and vagal nerve stimulation, are discussed. Incorporating nerve growth factor (NGF) into a comprehensive strategy may prove beneficial, particularly in non-neurodegenerative conditions such as stroke, trauma, and neuropathies.

    "abstract": "Microglia, the resident immune cells of the central nervous system, play a pivotal role in the response to Huntington's disease (HD) pathology. Through both cell-autonomous mechanisms and exposure to external pathogenic stimuli, microglia transition from a resting to an activated state, producing pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines that mediate inflammation. While this inflammatory response attempts to have a neuroprotective compensatory effect, chronic microglial activation exacerbates neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration and contributes to disease progression. Evidence from postmortem analyses and neuroimaging studies indicates that activated microglia are present in various stages of HD, correlating with neuronal degeneration and clinical symptoms. Enhanced microglial activation has been identified as an early predictor of disease onset, particularly in premanifest HD, highlighting the potential of targeting microglial pathways for therapeutic interventions. This review explores microglia's dual role in HD pathophysiology, exploring their contributions to both neuroinflammation and neuroprotection. It also examines recent advances in clinical trials aimed at modulating microglial activity, paving the way for novel therapeutic strategies to alter disease progression and improve patient outcomes."

Its functionality is closely tied to aquaporin 4 (AQP4) water channels, located primarily on astrocytic endfeet, which mediate water movement between the CSF and ISF. Proper glymphatic function relies on the cellular distribution of AQP4 channels and its astroglial endfeet polarization. Emerging evidence links glymphatic dysfunction to several neurodegenerative disorders, including Huntington's disease (HD). Understanding the role of the glymphatic system in HD pathogenesis could provide novel insights into disease pathogenesis and new therapeutic approaches.

    "abstract": "Neurological disorders are defined by a deterioration or disruption of the nervous system's structure and function. These diseases, which include multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and schizophrenia, are caused by intricate pathological processes that include excitotoxicity, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, genetic mutations, and compromised neurotrophic signaling. Although current pharmaceutical treatments relieve symptoms, their long-term efficacy is limited due to adverse side effects and weak neuroprotective properties. However, when combined with other neuroprotective drugs or adjunct therapy, they may offer additional benefits and improve treatment outcomes. Phytochemicals have emerged as attractive therapeutic agents due to their ability to regulate essential neurotrophic pathways, especially the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling cascade. BDNF is an important target for neurodegenerative disease (ND) treatment since it regulates neuronal survival, synaptic plasticity, neurogenesis, and neuroprotection. This review emphasizes the molecular pathways through which various phytochemicals-such as flavonoids, terpenoids, alkaloids, and phenolic compounds-stimulate BDNF expression and modulate its downstream signaling pathways, including GSK-3β, MAPK/ERK, PI3K/Akt/mTOR, CREB, and Wnt/β-catenin. This paper also highlights how phytochemical combinations may interact to enhance BDNF activity, offering new therapeutic options for ND treatment. Despite their potential for neuroprotection, phytochemicals face challenges related to pharmacokinetics, blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, and absorption, highlighting the need for further research into combination therapies and improved formulations. Clinical assessment and mechanistic understanding of BDNF-targeted phytotherapy should be the main goals of future studies. The therapeutic efficacy of natural compounds in regulating neurotrophic signaling is highlighted in this review, providing a viable approach to the prevention and treatment of NDs."

This reflects a profound lack of understanding of the pathogenesis of these diseases, indicating that the current paradigms guiding disease modeling and drug development are in need of reconsideration. The role of neuroglia, namely astrocytes, microglial cells, and oligodendrocytes, in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases emerged during the last decades. This chapter provides the state-of-the-art update on the changes of astrocytes, microglial cells, and oligodendrocytes in AD, PD, and HD. A growing body of evidence suggests that homeostatic and defensive functions of glial cells are compromised at different disease stages, leading to increased susceptibility of neurons to noxious stimuli, eventually resulting in their malfunction and degeneration. Investments are needed in the generation of novel preclinical models suitable for studying glial pathology, in \"humanizing\" research, and in-depth investigation of glial cell alterations to slow down and, possibly, halt and prevent the rise of neurodegenerative disease. Targeting glial cells opens new therapeutic avenues to treat AD, PD, and HD."

Neuroinflammation is characterized by increased blood vessel permeability, leukocyte infiltration, glial cell activation, and elevated production of inflammatory mediators, such as chemokines and cytokines. Microglia act as the resident macrophages of the central nervous system, serving as the principal defense mechanism in brain tissue. After CNS injury, microglia modify their morphology and downregulate genes that promote homeostatic functions. Despite comprehensive transcriptome analyses revealing specific gene modifications in \"pathological\" microglia, microglia's precise protective or harmful functions in neurological disorders remain insufficiently comprehended. Accumulating data suggests that the polarization of microglia into the M1 proinflammatory phenotype or the M2 antiinflammatory phenotype may serve as a sensible therapeutic strategy for neuroinflammation. Flavonoids, including rutin, fisetin, and quercetin, function as crucial chemical reservoirs with unique structures and diverse actions and are extensively used to modulate microglial polarization in treating neuroinflammation. This paper highlights the detrimental effects of neuroinflammation seen in neurological disorders such as stroke.

    "abstract": "Oxidative stress and chronic inflammation are important drivers in the pathogenesis and progression of many chronic diseases, such as cancers of the breast, kidney, lung, and others, autoimmune diseases (rheumatoid arthritis), cardiovascular diseases (hypertension, atherosclerosis, arrhythmia), neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease), mental disorders (depression, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder), gastrointestinal disorders (inflammatory bowel disease, colorectal cancer), and other disorders. With the increasing demand for less toxic and more tolerable therapies, flavonoids have the potential to effectively modulate the responsiveness to conventional therapy and radiotherapy. Flavonoids are polyphenolic compounds found in fruits, vegetables, grains, and plant-derived beverages. Six of the twelve structurally different flavonoid subgroups are of dietary significance and include anthocyanidins (e.g. pelargonidin, cyanidin), flavan-3-ols (e.g. epicatechin, epigallocatechin), flavonols (e.g. quercetin, kaempferol), flavones (e.g. luteolin, baicalein), flavanones (e.g. hesperetin, naringenin), and isoflavones (daidzein, genistein). The health benefits of flavonoids are related to their structural characteristics, such as the number and position of hydroxyl groups and the presence of C2C3 double bonds, which predetermine their ability to chelate metal ions, terminate ROS (e.g. hydroxyl radicals formed by the Fenton reaction), and interact with biological targets to trigger a biological response. Based on these structural characteristics, flavonoids can exert both antioxidant or prooxidant properties, modulate the activity of ROS-scavenging enzymes and the expression and activation of proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., interleukin-1beta (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α)), induce apoptosis and autophagy, and target key signaling pathways, such as the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and Bcl-2 family of proteins. This review aims to briefly discuss the mutually interconnected aspects of oxidative and inflammatory mechanisms, such as lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation, DNA damage, and the mechanism and resolution of inflammation. The major part of this article discusses the role of flavonoids in alleviating oxidative stress and inflammation, two common components of many human diseases.

Trained raters extracted demographics, disease characteristics (duration, United Huntington Disease Rating Scale [UHDRS] Motor Component Total scores, cytosine, adenine, guanine [CAG] repeats), and worst PAS scores from Epic. Two MBSImP-certified clinicians performed duplicate, independent, blinded ratings to obtain overall impairment and severity ratings. Inter- and intra-rater reliability, descriptive statistics, and Spearman's Rho correlations were performed. Swallowing safety profiles observed were 65% safe, 7.5% penetration, and 27.5% aspiration. 81% of aspirators did so silently. Relationships between PAS scores and disease duration (r<sub>s</sub> = 0.336, p = 0.036) and PAS scores and UHDRS motor scores (r<sub>s</sub> = 0.382, p = 0.020) were noted. 85% of MBSImP oral phase scores and 97.5% of pharyngeal phase scores had none-to-mild severity, while 15% and 2.5%, respectively, showed moderate severity. No significant correlations were observed between MBSImP scores, demographics, or disease characteristics. Individuals with HD exhibited greater impairments in swallowing efficiency than in safety, with the oral phase more affected than the pharyngeal. Relationships between swallowing safety and disease severity characteristics in HD suggest these metrics may serve as indicators of swallowing safety impairments, and that further assessment is warranted."

    "title": "Heat shock proteins in protein folding and reactivation.",
    "abstract": "Throughout their lives, cells synthesise new and dispose of the old, denatured proteins and insoluble protein aggregates. An important role in maintaining proteostasis is played by chaperones, which fold various proteins and promote degradation of denatured or misfolded proteins via proteasomes or autophagy. Despite protein folding being an accurate process, as organisms age and experience stress, errors accumulate, which leads to the formation of protein aggregates that can result in pathological changes. In addition, stress factors such as elevated temperature and altered pH can promote protein denaturation that can result in the proteins not only losing their native functions, but also gaining novel cytotoxic properties. With the increase of human average lifespan, more and more cases of proteinopathies - diseases caused by disruptions in proteostasis, e. g. Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease etc. - emerge. Therefore, identification of mechanisms preventing the formation of cytotoxic protein aggregates and promoting their clearance is of high importance. Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are the molecular chaperones involved in folding nascent proteins and refolding the denatured ones, leading to their reactivation. Heat shock proteins vary in structure and functions and are found in all prokaryotes and eukaryotes discovered to date. HSPs are constantly synthesised in cells under normal conditions, and a multitude of them are dramatically up-regulated during stress, which includes heat shock (which earned them their name) and metabolic stress caused by the increased numbers of misfolded proteins. In this review, we describe mechanisms of action and functions of members of five heat shock protein families."

    "abstract": "Salinity and alkalinity are critical environmental factors that affect fish physiology and ability to survive. <i>Oreochromis mossambicus</i> is a euryhaline species that can endure a wide range of salinities and has the potential to serve as a valuable model animal for environmental science. In order to detect the histomorphological changes, antioxidant enzymes, and proteomic responses of <i>O. mossambicus</i> to different osmotic stresses, <i>O. mossambicus</i> was subjected to salinity stress (25 g/L, S_S), alkalinity stress (4 g/L, A_S), saline-alkalinity stress (salinity: 25 g/L, alkalinity: 4 g/L, SA_S), and freshwater (the control group; C_S). The histomorphological and antioxidant enzyme results indicated that salinity, alkalinity, and saline-alkalinity stresses have different degrees of damage and effects on the gills and liver of <i>O. mossambicus</i>. Compared with the control, 83, 187, and 177 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were identified in the salinity, alkalinity, and saline-alkalinity stresses, respectively. The obtained DEPs can be summarized into four categories: ion transport channels or proteins, energy synthesis and metabolism, immunity, and apoptosis. The KEGG enrichment results indicated that DNA replication and repair were significantly enriched in the salinity stress group. Lysosomes and oxidative phosphorylation were considerably enriched in the alkalinity stress group. Comparatively, the three most important enriched pathways in the saline-alkalinity stress group were Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and Huntington's disease. The findings of this investigation yield robust empirical evidence elucidating osmoregulatory mechanisms and adaptive biological responses in euryhaline teleost, thereby establishing a scientific foundation for the cultivation and genomic exploration of high-salinity-tolerant teleost species. This advancement facilitates the sustainable exploitation of saline-alkaline aquatic ecosystems while contributing to the optimization of piscicultural practices in hypersaline environments."

    "abstract": "While whole-genome sequencing (WGS) using short-read technology has become a standard diagnostic test, this technology has limitations in analyzing certain genomic regions, particularly short tandem repeats (STRs). These repetitive sequences are associated with over 50 diseases, primarily affecting neurological function, including Huntington disease, frontotemporal dementia, and Friedreich's ataxia. We analyzed 2689 cases with movement disorders and dementia-related phenotypes processed at Variantyx in 2023-2024 using a two-tiered approach, with an initial short-read WGS followed by ONT long-read sequencing (when necessary) for variant characterization. Of the 2038 cases (75.8%) with clinically relevant genetic variants, 327 (16.0%) required additional long-read analysis. STR variants were reported in 338 cases (16.6% of positive cases), with approximately half requiring long-read sequencing for definitive classification. The combined approach enabled the precise determination of repeat length, composition, somatic mosaicism, and methylation status. Notable advantages included the detection of complex repeat structures in several genes such as <i>RFC1</i>, <i>FGF14</i>, and <i>FXN</i>, where long-read sequencing allowed to determine somatic repeat unit variations and accurate allele phasing. Further studies are needed to establish technology-specific guidelines for the standardized interpretation of long-read sequencing data for the clinical diagnostics of repeat expansion disorders."

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), and Huntington's disease (HD), are significant global health challenges, owing to their profound impact on cognitive, motor, and behavioral functions. The etiology and progression of these disorders are influenced by a complex interplay of environmental factors and genetic predispositions with specific genetic markers, such as mutations in the APOE and HTT genes, which play pivotal roles. Current therapeutic interventions predominantly focus on symptom management; however, emerging strategies, including gene therapies, anti-amyloid agents, and neuroprotective approaches, are designed to directly target the underlying disease mechanisms. Advances in biomarker discovery and imaging methodologies have emerged as essential tools for early diagnosis and monitoring of therapeutic efficacy in these disorders. In the context of AD, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid-beta (Aβ) and tau levels, along with positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, are well-established biomarkers. Similarly, CSF alpha-synuclein and dopamine transporter (DAT) imaging have been employed as diagnostic tools for PD. Moreover, emerging biomarkers, such as blood-based tau and the Aβ42/40 ratio for AD, as well as the neurofilament light chain (NfL) for ALS and PD, hold promise for enhancing early diagnostic accuracy and facilitating the longitudinal assessment of disease progression. This study comprehensively examined the molecular mechanisms underlying these neurodegenerative disorders, focusing on amyloid-beta plaque deposition and tau protein aggregation in AD, alpha-synuclein misfolding in PD, and aberrant protein aggregation in ALS and HD, thereby contributing to a deeper understanding of the pathophysiological basis of these disorders."

    "abstract": "Communicating genetic information within families living with inherited genetic conditions (IGCs), especially incurable and progressive late-onset neurodegenerative diseases (LONDs), presents significant challenges. To date, no literature review has specifically addressed this issue in families with LONDs. To fill this gap, a scoping review was conducted following PRISMA and JBI guidelines. Four databases (Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, and PsycInfo) were searched, resulting in 31 articles for analysis. Six categories were identified: (i) from whom to whom: communication transmitters and receivers, (ii) what to tell: content and details of communication, (iii) how to tell: communication approach, (iv) when to tell: timing of communication, (v) barriers and reasons for not communicating, and (vi) facilitators and reasons for communicating. Sharing information about LONDs is a multi-step, deliberative process involving several transmitters and receivers. It typically begins with first-degree relatives, with women often assuming a pivotal role in the gathering and dissemination of information, and extends to the wider family. This process includes assessing the family member's subjective experiences and the potential impact of the information. Fear of stigmatization and discrimination are notable barriers, while feelings of responsibility and moral obligation toward family members are strong motivators for transmitters to communicate. The studies included in this review were all retrospective, primarily utilized a qualitative design, and predominantly focused on families with Huntington's disease. Prospective studies are needed to investigate disclosure decision-making in families with other LONDs and to explore how the potential availability of clinical trials for testing new drugs might influence family communication."

    "abstract": "Huntington's disease (HD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a variety of debilitating symptoms including abnormal motor control, cognitive impairment, and psychiatric disturbances. Despite significant efforts, efficacious treatments to alter the course of HD remain elusive, highlighting the need to explore new therapeutic strategies, including lifestyle changes that may delay the onset of symptoms and slow disease progression. Recent research indicates that time-restricted eating (TRE), a type of intermittent fasting where caloric intake is confined to a specific time window each day, may be beneficial in treating neurodegenerative diseases like HD. TRE has been found to enhance mitochondrial function, stimulate autophagy, lower oxidative stress, and improve cognitive performance. Although TRE has shown potential in HD animal models and non-HD populations, it has yet to be analyzed for safety, feasibility, and efficacy in persons with HD. Therefore, we propose a prospective interventional, open-label, single-arm, pilot study of 25 participants with late prodromal and early manifest HD to evaluate participant adherence to TRE diet - specifically, maintaining a 6-8-hour eating window every day for 12 weeks. Secondary measures will include pre- versus post-intervention assessment of body composition via bioelectrical impedance analysis, vital signs and safety labs, serum biomarkers of neurodegeneration, and standard HD behavioral, cognitive, and motor function clinical scales. Additional exploratory measures will evaluate sleep quality, physical activity, mood, dietary composition, and mitochondrial function. We expect that the diet will be safe, feasible, and may also improve biomarkers of disease progression in persons with HD. We anticipate this study will lay the foundation for future large-scale clinical trials to further evaluate the clinical efficacy of TRE in HD. This study has been registered on July 8, 2024 with ClinicalTrials.gov registration number NCT06490367 (https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06490367)."

Berberine (BBR), a natural alkaloid compound in various plants, has been recognized for its potential neuroprotective properties. This review explores the current understanding of BBR's mechanisms of action and its therapeutic potential in preventing and treating NDs such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease. BBR's neuroprotective properties are attributed to its multifaceted actions, including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antiapoptotic, and neurotrophic effects. In addition, BBR can influence many signaling pathways involved in neurodegeneration, including AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor pathways. Furthermore, BBR targets vital signaling pathways, including AMPK, PI3K/Akt, and MAPK, which are essential for developing NDs. In addition, BBR's efficacy in reducing neurodegenerative pathology and improving cognitive function has been demonstrated through preclinical studies using cellular and animal models. Clinical trials demonstrating BBR's therapeutic potential in NDs have yielded promising results, but further research is needed to confirm its safety and efficacy in humans."

    "abstract": "The mitochondria are highly dynamic organelles. The mitochondrial morphology and spatial distribution within the cell is determined by fusion and fission processes of mitochondria. Several studies have used mitochondrial division inhibitor-1 (Mdivi.1) to explore the roles of mitochondrial dynamics in various pathological conditions, including diabetic cardiomyopathy, myocardial infarction, cardiac hypertrophy, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease and cancers. The objective of the study was to investigate the role of mitochondrial dynamics in the invasiveness of HCT116 colorectal cancer cells. MTT assay was used to determine the Mdivi.1-induced toxicity in HCT116 cells. Wound healing, cell migration and colony forming assays were adopted to measure the migration and invasion activity of HCT116 cells. Furthermore, flow cytometry was used to determine the Mdivi.1-induced mitochondrial mass quantification, mitochondrial membrane potential and reactive oxygen species generation in HCT116 cells. Additionally, Western Blot analysis was used to determine the expression level of Drp1, p-Drp1, Mnf2, AMPK-α, p-AMPK-α, Cox-2, iNos and MMP9 in HCT116 cells. We found that Mdivi.1 induced toxicity and altered the morphology of HCT116 cells in concentration- and time-dependent manners. Mdivi.1 significantly increased mitochondrial mass and dissipated the mitochondrial membrane potential. Furthermore, Mdivi.1 induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and mitochondrial superoxide production, leading to AMPK activation. Moreover, Mdivi.1 decreased dynamin-related protein-1 (Drp1) and phosphorylated-Drp1 expression and increased mitofusin-2 (Mfn2) expression in a concentration-dependent manner at 48 and 72 h post-treatment. Notably, Mdivi.1 induced inhibition of translocation of Drp1 from the cytosol to the outer mitochondrial membrane. Mdivi.1 significantly suppressed the invasion and migration of HCT116 cells and inhibited the formation of HCT116 cell colonies. In addition, Mdivi.1 significantly decreased the expression of metastatic markers including Cox-2, iNos, and MMP-9 in HCT116 cells. Collectively, this study revealed that Mdivi.1 downregulates Drp1, upregulates Mfn2, and increases mitochondrial mass with attenuated oxidative metabolism, leading to the inhibition of cell invasion and metastasis in colorectal cancer HCT116 cells. Mitochondrial dynamics are regarded as possible drug targets for interrupting colorectal cancer cell migration and metastasis."

Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a member of the neurotrophin family of growth factors. It plays a crucial role in maintaining the survival and proper function of striatal neurons. Depletion of BDNF has been linked to impairment and death of striatal neurons, leading to the manifestation of motor, cognitive, and behavioral dysfunctions characteristic of Huntington's disease. This review highlights the current update on the neurobiology of BDNF in the pathogenesis of Huntington's disease. The molecular evidence and the affected signaling pathways are also discussed.

    "abstract": "Though abnormal platelet function is detected in Huntington's disease (HD), thrombin's role is indistinct. Through protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR-1) activation, thrombin triggers intricate pathways relevant to HD. Therefore, we propose that posttreatment with the PAR-1 inhibitor SCH79797 may alleviate symptoms in a 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NP) HD model. Wistar rats were administered 3-NP alone or treated with SCH79797. In silico study showed better blood-brain barrier (BBB) diffusion by SCH79797 than by vorapaxar. Docking showed that SCH79797 blocks thrombin/PAR-1 binding and directly inhibits metalloproteinase (MMP)-1. Molecular dynamics confirmed minimal energy deviation and stable interactions with both PAR-1 and MMP-1 and root mean square deviation (RMSD) verified conformational stability. In the in vivo part, behavioral and striatal improvements were observed, with SCH79797 reducing striatal levels of thrombin and MMP-1, and the expression of PAR-1, N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunits (1 and 2B), and MMP-9, while increasing that of claudin-5, contributing to BBB integrity. SCH79797 also lowered tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and mitofusin (Mfn)-2, rebalanced the redox system by reducing malondialdehyde (MDA) and enhancing superoxide dismutase (SOD), and prevented 3-NP-induced mitophagy via the PTEN-induced kinase (PINK)-1/ubiquitin pathway. SCH79797 inhibited apoptosis, by reducing caspase-3 and cytochrome C, and increased voltage-dependent anion channel-1 (VDAC1) to maintain mitochondrial function. Overall, SCH79797 inhibited PAR-1 canonically and noncanonically to counter excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis, and mitophagy, thereby preserving BBB and mitochondrial integrity, improving histological outcomes, and enhancing behavioral performance."

Patients using concomitant strong CYP2D6 inhibitors at time of deutetrabenazine initiation, those who became deceased or lost to follow-up within six months of dose increase above 48 mg/day, or previously enrolled in a study on >48 mg daily and moving to commercial product were excluded. Outcomes were reported descriptively including therapeutic response, adverse effects (AEs), adherence (measured by proportion of days covered [PDC]), and discontinuation.ResultsThirty patients were included: 47% female, 93% White, median age 56 years. Most patients required dose escalations for inadequate response. The rate of AEs reported before and after transitioning to doses >48 mg/day was the same. Psychiatric changes were less commonly reported at doses >48 mg/day, but extrapyramidal symptoms were more common. The median total maximum chorea score in the Unified HD Rating Scale was 13 (IQR 9-19) and 13 (IQR 7-18) at baseline and follow-up, respectively. Median PDC was 0.99 (IQR 0.94-1.00); two patients discontinued therapy due to AEs.ConclusionsDeutetrabenazine >48 mg daily appears safe and well tolerated in patients with uncontrolled HD chorea, though no significant change in total maximal chorea score was found."

We investigated the genetic basis of EH in African-derived individuals from partially isolated quilombo populations in Vale do Ribeira (São Paulo, Brazil). Samples from 431 individuals (167 affected, 261 unaffected, 3 unknown) were genotyped using a 650 000 single-nucleotide polymorphism array. Estimated global ancestry proportions were 47% African, 36% European, and 16% Native American. We constructed 6 pedigrees using additional data from 673 individuals and created 3 nonoverlapping single-nucleotide polymorphism subpanels. We phased haplotypes and performed local ancestry analysis to account for admixture. Genome-wide linkage analysis and fine-mapping via family-based association studies were conducted, prioritizing EH-associated genes through a systematic approach involving databases like PubMed, ClinVar, and GWAS (Genome-Wide Association Studies) Catalog. Linkage analysis identified 22 regions of interest with logarithm of the odds scores ranging from 1.45 to 3.03, encompassing 2363 genes. Fine-mapping (family-based association studies) identified 60 EH-related candidate genes and 117 suggestive/significant variants. Among these, 14 genes, including <i>PHGDH</i>, <i>S100A10</i>, <i>MFN2</i>, and <i>RYR2</i>, were strongly related to hypertension harboring 29 suggestive/significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Through a complementary approach combining admixture-adjusted Genome-wide linkage analysis based on Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, family-based association studies on known and imputed data, and gene prioritizing, new loci, variants, and candidate genes were identified. These findings provide targets for future research, replication in other populations, facilitate personalized treatments, and improve public health toward African-derived underrepresented populations.

To clarify the effect of education attainment on the age of motor symptoms onset and clinical progression of HD patients from Western China. A total of 244 adult-onset Chinese HD patients were included in the analysis. Linear regression, Kaplan-Meier analysis, and Cox regression analysis were conducted to assess the effect of education on the disease progression in HD. Higher education level was significantly associated with slower decline in cognitive performance, as indicated by the Symbol Digit Modality Test (β = 0.339 [95% CI, 0.047, 0.632], p = 0.026), while it exhibited no association with the progression of other symptoms. The present findings suggest that education attainment is associated with a milder cognitive decline in Chinese HD patients."

While investigations of specific mechanistic aspects of diseases have been aided by cell and animal models, true advances in the understanding of neurodegeneration require that we deal with the daunting complexities of the human brain. In this review, we discuss novel molecular profiling methods that have been applied to human postmortem brain tissue during the last decade and highlight insights into cell type-specific molecular characteristics and disease-associated changes in both vulnerable and resilient cell types in Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. We also illustrate how these approaches can complement human genetic analyses and studies of animal models to advance our understanding of human neurodegeneration."

    "abstract": "Antidopaminergic medications (ADM) are often used for symptom management of Huntington's disease (HD). Evidence from past research suggests that ADMs are associated with worse clinical outcomes in HD, but their impact on various domains remains underexplored. We used causal inference analysis to understand the impact of ADM use on measures of clinical progression in HD across multiple domains over 2 years. We used the Enroll-HD database with a new-user design, which compared a cohort that initiated ADM use after the first visit with an unexposed cohort that remained off ADMs. To control for 27 covariates, we used a doubly robust targeted maximum likelihood estimation and conducted two analyses. First, we analyzed ADM treatment 2 years post-baseline and separately for 12 outcome measures. Second, we examined the association of ADM dose with measures of clinical outcomes. The ADM-exposed group exhibited faster change in measures of clinical outcome compared with the off-ADM group, which was statistically reliable in cognitive and functional outcome measures, and the composite Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (cUHDRS). Motor domain analyses showed faster change in bradykinesia in the ADM-exposed group versus off-ADM but no difference in chorea or total motor score (TMS). Higher ADM doses also showed greater differences compared to the off-ADM group. ADM use was associated with more rapid change in clinical measures, particularly in cognitive and functional domains. However, assumptions required to establish causation between ADM use and disease progression may not have been fully met, and further research is warranted. © 2025 The Author(s).

A prospective study is needed to test whether the approach meets primary end points to be considered in a diagnostic workup. To assess the discriminative performance of Automated Imaging Differentiation for Parkinsonism (AIDP) using 3-T diffusion MRI and support vector machine (SVM) learning. This was a prospective, multicenter cohort study conducted from July 2021 to January 2024 across 21 Parkinson Study Group sites (US/Canada).

    "abstract": "Early stages of Huntington's disease (HD) before the onset of motor and cognitive symptoms are characterized by imbalanced excitatory and inhibitory output from the cortex to striatal and subcortical structures. The window before the onset of symptoms presents an opportunity to adjust the firing rate within microcircuits with the goal of restoring the impaired E/I balance, thereby preventing or slowing down disease progression. Here, we investigated the effect of presymptomatic cell-type specific manipulation of activity of pyramidal neurons and parvalbumin interneurons in the M1 motor cortex on disease progression in the R6/2 HD mouse model. Our results show that dampening excitation of Emx1 pyramidal neurons or increasing activity of parvalbumin interneurons once daily for 3 weeks during the pre-symptomatic phase alleviated HD-related motor coordination dysfunction. Cell-type-specific modulation to normalize the net output of the cortex is a potential therapeutic avenue for HD and other neurodegenerative disorders."

    "abstract": "Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by an abnormal CAG expansion in the Huntingtin (HTT) gene. Given its simple genetic cause but complex pathogenic mechanisms, interest in targeting HTT for HD treatment is growing, necessitating a clear understanding of HTT regulation. HTT protein primarily exists in a core complex with HAP40, forming a highly ordered structure with two large globular domains connected by a bridge. We previously demonstrated that HAP40 is conserved in <i>Drosophila</i>, controls HTT's function, protein stability, and levels, and is a potential modifier of HD pathogenesis, supporting its central role in HTT regulation. Here, we showed that HTT synergizes with HAP40 to induce novel gain-of-function effects in <i>Drosophila</i> when overexpressed. Protein modeling revealed that despite their prominent evolutionary and sequence divergence, the fly and human HTT-HAP40 complexes share a high degree of structural similarity. Protein-contact maps and molecular simulations showed that HAP40 preferentially binds to HTT's C-terminal domain in both complexes. By examining the interfacial contacts between HTT and HAP40 in fly and human complexes, we identified ten conserved bonds that are important for HAP40's affinity for HTT. Finally, we showed that the conserved N-terminal BΦ motif in HAP40 is not essential for HTT binding but important for HAP40's functions. Through the structural-functional analyses of the fly and human HTT-HAP40 complexes, our results support that the structural similarity underlies the functional conservation of the two complexes from these evolutionarily distant species and further uncover novel insight into HAP40 regulation and its interaction with HTT."

    "title": "Transcriptomic analysis of intracellular RNA granules and small extracellular vesicles: Unmasking their overlap in a cell model of Huntington's disease.",
    "abstract": "Huntington's disease (HD) arises from the abnormal expansion of a CAG repeat in the HTT gene. The mutant CAG repeat triggers aberrant RNA-protein interactions and translates into toxic aggregate-prone polyglutamine protein. These aberrant RNA-protein ineractions also seed the formation of cytoplasmic liquid-like granules, such as stress granules. Emerging evidence demonstrates that granules formed via liquid-liquid phase separation can mature into gel-like inclusions that persist within the cell and may act as precursor to aggregates that occur in patients' tissue. Thus, deregulation of RNA granules is an important component of neurodegeneration. Interestingly, both the formation of intracellular membrane-less organelles like stress granules and the secretion of small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) increase upon stress and under disease conditions. sEVs are lipid membrane-bound particles that are secreted from all cell types and may participate in the spreading of misfolded proteins and aberrant RNA-protein complexes across the central nervous system in neurodegenerative diseases like HD. In this study, we performed a comparative transcriptomic analysis of sEVs and RNA granules in an HD model. RNA granules and sEVs were isolated from an inducible HD cell model. Both sEVs and RNA granules were isolated from induced (HD) and non-induced (control) cells and analyzed by RNA sequencing. Our comparative analysis between the transcriptomics data of HD RNA granules and sEVs showed that: (I) intracellular RNA granules and extracellular RNA vesicles share content, (II) several non-coding RNAs translocate to RNA granules, and (III) the composition of RNA granules and sEVs is affected in HD cells. Our data showing common transcripts in intracellular RNA granules and extracellular sEVs suggest that formation of RNA granules and sEV loading may be related. Moreover, we found a high abundance of lncRNAs in both control and HD samples, with several transcripts under REST regulation, highlighting their potential role in HD pathogenesis and selective incorporation into sEVs. The transcriptome cargo of RNA granules or sEVs may serve as a source for diagnostic strategies. For example, disease-specific RNA-signatures of sEVs can serve as biomarker of central nervous system diseases. Therefore, we compared our dataset to transcriptomic data from HD patient sEVs in blood. However, our data suggest that the cell-type specific signature of sEV-secreted RNAs as well as their high variability may make it difficult to detect these biomarkers in blood."

    "abstract": "Huntington's disease (HD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder with cognitive and motor symptoms that typically manifest in adulthood. However, embryonic brain development impairments leading to cortical defects in HD mutation carriers has been shown recently supporting a neurodevelopmental component in HD. Despite HD is primarily recognized as a striatal pathology, developmental alterations in this structure, particularly during the early postnatal period, remain poorly understood. To fill this gap, we examined striatal development in newborn R6/1 mice. We found that D2 receptor-expressing indirect-pathway medium spiny neurons (D2-MSNs) present in the matrix striatal compartment undergo early morphological and electrophysiological maturation. Altered electrophysiological properties were also observed in newborn CAG140 mice. Additionally, we also observed a D2-MSN-selective reduction in glutamatergic cortico-striatal transmission at the beginning of the second postnatal week as well as a reduced projection of D2-MSNs onto the GPe at birth in R6/1 mice. All these alterations were transient with the circuit normalizing after the second postnatal week. These results identify a compartment- and cell-type specific defect in D2-MSNs maturation, which can contribute in their latter vulnerability, as this cell-type is the first to degenerate in HD during adulthood."

This study evaluates the efficacy of empagliflozin (EMPA) in reducing ischemia/reperfusion damage in both the brain and heart using rat models. Ischemic stroke and myocardial infarction (MI) were induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats, which were randomized into three groups: (1) Control (no EMPA), (2) Acute treatment (EMPA, 10 mg/kg IV, administered 10 min before ischemia and 1 min before reperfusion), and (3) Chronic treatment (EMPA, 20 mg/kg in food for 7 days before ischemia). Stroke was induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for one hour, followed by 3 h of reperfusion, and MI was induced by left coronary artery occlusion for 30 min, followed by 3 h of reperfusion. Brain and heart tissues were analyzed for anatomic size of myocardial infarction and stroke. In the brain, cerebral infarction was significantly smaller in both EMPA treatment groups compared to controls (acute: 3.7 ± 1.2%, chronic: 6.9 ± 2.1% vs. control: 14.5 ± 2.5%, p < 0.05). Edema was also reduced in the EMPA groups (acute: 5.5 ± 0.9%, chronic: 5.9 ± 0.8% vs. control: 9.6 ± 1.2%, p < 0.05). In the heart, MI size was significantly reduced in both EMPA groups (acute: 46.9 ± 2.0%, chronic: 48.8 ± 5.8% vs. control: 70.0 ± 2.6%, p < 0.05), and no-reflow size was smaller in the EMPA groups (acute: 36.3 ± 3.3%, chronic: 33.9 ± 4.3% vs. control: 53.4 ± 3.3%, p < 0.05). EMPA treatment, both acute and chronic, significantly reduces cerebral infarct volume and edema, as well as myocardial infarct size and no-reflow in rat models of ischemic stroke and myocardial ischemia/reperfusion, indicating substantial neuroprotective and cardioprotective effects."

    "abstract": "Disease tolerance is a host response to infection that limits collateral damage to host tissues while having a neutral effect on pathogen fitness. Previously, we found that the pathogenic lactic acid bacterium Streptococcus pyogenes manipulates disease tolerance using its aerobic mixed-acid fermentation pathway via the enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase, but the microbe-derived molecules that mediate communication with the host's disease tolerance pathways remain elusive. Here we show in a murine model that aerobic mixed-acid fermentation inhibits the accumulation of inflammatory cells including neutrophils and macrophages, reduces the immunosuppressive cytokine interleukin-10, and delays bacterial clearance and wound healing. In infected macrophages, the aerobic mixed-acid fermentation end-products acetate and formate from streptococcal upregulate host acetyl-CoA metabolism and reduce interleukin-10 expression. Inhibiting aerobic mixed-acid fermentation using a bacterial-specific pyruvate dehydrogenase inhibitor reduces tissue damage during murine infection, correlating with increased interleukin-10 expression. Our results thus suggest that reprogramming carbon flow provides a therapeutic strategy to mitigate tissue damage during infection."

NDDs include Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), among others. Previous studies have demonstrated that the pathogenesis of NDDs involves various mechanisms, including genetic factors, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and the immune response. Recent studies have shown that epigenetic regulation mediates the interactions between DNA methylation, chromatin remodeling, histone modification, and non-coding RNAs, thus affecting gene transcription.

Epigenetics has also been found to regulate and maintain nervous system function, and its imbalance is closely related to the occurrence and development of NDDs. The present review summarizes focuses on the role of epigenetic modifications in the pathogenesis of NDDs and provides an overview of the key genes regulated by DNA methylation, histone modification, and non-coding RNAs in NDDs. Further, the current research status of epigenetics in NDDs is summarized and the potential application of epigenetics in the clinical diagnosis and treatment of NDDs is discussed."

The patient in this case was an otherwise healthy 50-year-old man who presented with gradually worsening shortness of breath, weight loss, fatigue, chills, and leg swelling for six weeks. He had no prior history of cardiac disease and had never used intravenous drugs, but he had undergone extensive dental work following a military-associated injury. A workup for IE was done, and echocardiography revealed a bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) with vegetations causing moderate to severe aortic regurgitation. Blood cultures, which initially showed only gram-positive cocci, later identified <i>Gemella sanguinis</i>. He subsequently recovered after receiving treatment with antibiotics and undergoing an aortic valve replacement. The patient's BAV and significant dental history acted as risk factors for this condition, and although his symptoms were nonspecific and he did not exhibit other classic risk factors for IE, his case represents the importance of keeping high clinical suspicion to allow for prompt initiation of appropriate treatment. More research on <i>Gemella</i> is needed, as these species are difficult to identify and therefore may be a more significant cause of infection than is currently known."

Abnormal UBE3A activity is essential for the initiation and progression of several cancers. A gain of function and an overdosage of maternal UBE3A is associated with an increased risk of autism spectrum disorders. Conversely, a loss of function due to mutations, deletions, paternal duplications, or imprinting defects in neurons leads to Angelman syndrome. Emerging evidence suggests that abnormal UBE3A activity may also contribute to the development of various brain disorders, including schizophrenia, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease, making UBE3A a protein of significant interest. However, research on UBE3A's functions in the brain has primarily focused on neurons due to the imprinting of UBE3A in mature neuronal cells, while being obscured in glia. This review outlines the expression of UBE3A in neurons and glial cells based on published studies, highlights newly identified patterns of UBE3A, such as its secretion, and emphasizes the involvement of UBE3A in neurodegenerative diseases. Furthermore, we summarize glial UBE3A and propose a model of bi-directional interactions between the neurons and glia mediated by UBE3A that underlies brain functions.

Nutrients contribute to a beneficial metabolic equilibrium at the cellular level, preventing or delaying disease onset. Dietary intake contributes to obesity, and obesity supports further cancer and metastasis. Metastasis, a multifactorial and multistep process, is supported by the systemic inflammation of obesity. Spreading of the cancer cells requires the presence of a plethora of recruiter and regulator molecules. Molecules such as chemokines are provided at high levels by obesity-associated fat depots. Chemokine up-regulation in adipose tissue of obese individuals has been associated with different types of cancers such as breast, prostate, colon, liver, and stomach. Chemokines support all metastasis steps from invasion/migration to intravasation, circulation, extravasation, and ending with colonization. The obesity pool of chemokines supporting these processes includes CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CCL5, CCL7, CCL8, CCL11, CCL18, CCL19, CCL20, CXCL1, CXCL5, CXCL 8, CXCL10, and CXCL12. Keeping obesity under control can be beneficial in reducing the levels of pro-inflammatory chemokines and the risk of poor cancer outcome. Nutrients can help, support, and boost cancer treatment effects or jeopardize the treatment. Constituents with anti-inflammatory and anti-obesity properties such as polyphenols, organosulfur components, fatty acids, curcumin, and vitamin E have a proven beneficial effect in lowering obesity and its contribution to metastasis."

However, in recent years, innovative therapeutic strategies have tried to bypass the restriction of traditional drug delivery methods. In vivo gene therapy refers to emerging biopharma vectors that carry the specific genes and target and infect specific tissues; these infected cells and tissues then undergo fundamental changes at the genetic level and produce therapeutic proteins or substances, thus providing therapeutic benefits. Clinical and preclinical trials mainly utilize adeno-associated viruses (AAVs), lentiviruses (LVs), and other viruses as gene vectors for disease investigation. Although LVs have a higher gene-carrying capacity, the vector of choice for many neurological diseases is the AAV vector due to its safety and long-term transgene expression in neurons. Here, we review the basic biology of AAVs and summarize some key issues in recombinant AAV (rAAV) engineering in gene therapy research; then, we summarize recent clinical trials using rAAV treatment for neurological diseases and provide translational perspectives and future challenges on target selection."

However, how the duration of IH correlates with its deleterious effects remains unexplored. We aimed to assess the effects of IH over a prolonged period of time mimicking untreated OSA. Male C57Bl/6J mice were exposed to IH for 96 weeks. Sleep activity was acquired using a piezoelectric system. Novel object recognition (NOR) and the elevated plus maze test (EPMT) were conducted as measures of cognitive function and anxiety, respectively. Brain inflammation was evaluated by a panel of inflammation marker assays. All tests were performed after 16 and 96 weeks of IH exposure. After 96 weeks, sleep percentages during the dark phase decreased in both IH and room air (RA) compared to 16-week exposure (RA: <i>p</i> = 0.0214; IH: <i>p</i> = 0.0188). In addition to age-dependent declines in NOR performance, the mice after 96 weeks of IH exposure had lower NOR preference scores than RA controls (<i>p</i> = 0.0070). The time spent in open arms of the EPMT was reduced in mice exposed to IH compared to RA. Inflammatory marker expression increased in IH-exposed mice. Thus, aging and IH induce similar alterations in sleep, cognition, and neuroinflammation. However, the effects of aging are exacerbated by concurrent IH, suggesting that OSA is a disease associated with an acceleration in biological aging."

The illness often manifests late in life, with diverse neurological and psychiatric symptoms, suggesting involvement of different brain regions. Prominent neuronal loss and atrophy of the cerebellum have been noted earlier. In Huntington's disease (HD), somatic instability associated with the size of the expanded CAG allele in HTT varies across regions of the brain, and influences the nature and severity of symptoms. We estimated CAG repeat size, methylation and gene expression in the PPP2R2B gene across regions in brain tissue from a person with SCA12. We also studied the regional expression of DNA repair pathway and cell cycle genes. Somatic mosaicism, manifested as CAG repeat instability, is detected across brain regions. The cerebellum showed the least somatic instability, and this was coupled with increased methylation, and lower expression, of the PPP2R2B gene. Interestingly, increased expression of DNA maintenance pathway related genes, which might partly explain the lowered DNA instability, was also observed. There was also decreased expression of cell cycle modulators, which could initiate apoptosis, and thus account for neuronal cell death seen in the brain sections. We suggest that drugs that improve DNA repeat stability, could thus be explored as a treatment option for SCA12."

Prior to motor symptoms onset, alterations, and dysfunctions in the corticostriatal projections have been described along with cognitive deficits, but the sequence of early alterations of brain circuits is largely unknown. There is thus a crucial need to identify early alterations that precede symptoms and that could be used as potential early disease markers. Using an HD knock-in mouse model (Hdh<sup>CAG140/+</sup>) that recapitulates the human genetic alterations and that shows a late and progressive appearance of anatomical and behavioral deficits, we identified early alterations in the motor learning abilities of young mice, long before any motor coordination dysfunctions. In parallel, ex vivo two-photon calcium recordings revealed that young HD mice have altered basal activity patterns in both the dorsomedial and dorsolateral parts of the striatum. In addition, although wild-type mice display specific reorganization of the activity upon motor training, network alterations present in the basal state of non-trained mice are not affected by motor training of HD mice. Our results thus identify early behavioral deficits and network alterations that could serve as early markers of the disease."

A rat cystitis model was established through a systemic intraperitoneal injection with cyclophosphamide (CYP). EA therapy was executed by stimulating the deep part of the hypochondriac point, where the 2nd-4th sacral nerves traverse. EA treatment was observed to effectively reduce mechanical allodynia, enhance urinary function, suppress the activation of microglial cells, and alleviate neuroinflammation. Additionally, EA demonstrated the capability to downregulate BDNF-TrkB signal transduction in the spinal dorsal horn. Transcriptome sequencing has indicated that EA therapy potentially inhibits excitatory neural transmission and modulates several pathways related to longevity. Furthermore, EA therapy has shown efficacy in treating conditions such as Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and prion diseases. In conclusion, by regulating the BDNF-TrkB signaling, EA nerve stimulation can effectively alleviate bladder dysfunction and mechanical allodynia in cyclophosphamide-induced cystitis model. Our research elucidates the underlying mechanisms of EA therapy in treating bladder dysfunction and offers new theoretical insights for addressing painful sensitization in BPS.<b>Significance Statement</b> Central sensitization is a major factor in bladder pain syndrome/interstitial cystitis (BPS/IC), making effective pain management crucial. This study explores the potential of electroacupuncture (EA) as a therapeutic approach to alleviate pain and improve bladder function in a rat model of BPS/IC induced by cyclophosphamide. Our findings demonstrate that EA therapy significantly reduces mechanical allodynia, enhances urinary function, and decreases neuroinflammation by modulating BDNF-TrkB signaling in the spinal dorsal horn. The research highlights EA's capability to inhibit excitatory neural transmission and provide relief in chronic pain conditions. These results offer new insights into the mechanisms of EA therapy, potentially improving treatment strategies for BPS/IC and similar pain syndromes."

    "title": "Intersecting impact of CAG repeat and Huntingtin knockout in stem cell-derived cortical neurons.",
    "abstract": "Huntington's Disease (HD) is caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the gene encoding Huntingtin (HTT <i>)</i> . While normal HTT function appears impacted by the mutation, the specific pathways unique to CAG repeat expansion versus loss of normal function are unclear. To understand the impact of the CAG repeat expansion, we evaluated biological signatures of HTT knockout ( <i>HTT</i> KO) versus those that occur from the CAG repeat expansion by applying multi-omics, live cell imaging, survival analysis and a novel feature-based pipeline to study cortical neurons (eCNs) derived from an isogenic human embryonic stem cell series (RUES2). <i>HTT</i> KO and the CAG repeat expansion influence developmental trajectories of eCNs, with opposing effects on the growth. Network analyses of differentially expressed genes and proteins associated with enriched epigenetic motifs identified subnetworks common to CAG repeat expansion and <i>HTT</i> KO that include neuronal differentiation, cell cycle regulation, and mechanisms related to transcriptional repression and may represent gain-of-function mechanisms that cannot be explained by <i>HTT</i> loss of function alone. A combination of dominant and loss-of-function mechanisms are likely involved in the aberrant neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative features of HD that can help inform therapeutic strategies."

    "abstract": "Huntington's disease (HD) is characterized by progressive motor dysfunction and cognitive decline. Early diagnosis and new therapeutic targets are essential for effective interventions. We performed integrative analyses of mRNA profiles from three microarrays and one RNA-seq dataset from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. The datasets included were GSE8762, GSE24250, GSE45516, and GSE64810. Data pre-processing included background correction, normalization, log2 transformation, probe-to-gene symbol mapping, and differential expression analysis. We identified 80 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) based on a significance threshold (<i>p</i> < 0.05) and absolute log fold change (logFC) >0.65. Additionally, we conducted Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway analyses of the identified genes. Protein-protein interactions among DEGs revealed a network from which seven hub genes (<i>VIM, COL1A1, COL3A1, COL1A2, DCN, CXCR2,</i> and <i>S100A9</i>) were identified using the cytoHubba plugin in Cytoscape software. Two top DEGs, <i>IGHG1</i> (up-regulated) and <i>PITX1</i> (up-regulated), also hold potential as therapeutic targets. Insofar as biological contextualization of the findings is concerned, the top enriched GO terms were skeletal system development, blood vessel development, and vasculature development. Molecular function terms highlighted signaling receptor binding, extracellular matrix structural constituent, and platelet-derived growth factor binding. Notably, the significant KEGG pathways included amoebiasis, the AGE-RAGE signaling pathway in diabetic complications, and the relaxin signaling pathway. In conclusion, the present computational biology integrative analyses of multiple datasets discovered new DEGs and seven hub genes, shedding light on molecular mechanisms of HD. These findings call for translational clinical omics research and may potentially lead to future precision medicine interventions and novel diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets."

    "abstract": "Human ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency (OTCD) is the most common ureagenesis disorder in the world. OTCD is an X-linked genetic deficiency in which patients experience hyperammonemia to varying degrees depending on the severity of the genetic mutation. More than two-thirds of the known mutations are caused by single nucleotide substitutions. In this paper, partial order optimum likelihood (POOL), a machine learning method, is used to analyze single nucleotide substitutions in OTC with varying disease phenotypes and predicted catalytic efficiencies. Specifically, we used a computed metric, μ<sub>4</sub>, a measure of the degree of coupling between an ionizable residue and its neighbors, calculated for the catalytic residues, to identify which protein variants were most likely to have impacted catalytic activities. From this analysis, 17 disease-associated variants were selected plus one additional variant, representing a range of μ<sub>4</sub> values and POOL ranks. Then μ<sub>4</sub> predictions were compared with established bioinformatics tools, SIFT, PolyPhen-2, Provean, FATHMM, MutPred2, and MutationTaster2. The bioinformatics tools predicted that most of these mutations are deleterious. The variants were biochemically characterized using kinetics assays, size exclusion chromatography, and differential scanning fluorimetry. POOL combined with μ<sub>4</sub> analysis was able to predict correctly which variants were catalytically hindered in vitro for 17 out of 18 variants. Then by expressing a subset of these proteins in cell culture, mechanisms for disease were proposed. Analysis using μ<sub>4</sub> is a complementary method to the sequence-based bioinformatics tools for predicting the effects of mutation on catalytic function."

    "abstract": "We developed Huntington's disease (HD) modelling induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) by genome engineering of iPSCs from healthy donors. For this, we established a homologous-recombination-based biallelic substitution technique called the allele-specific universal knock-in system (asUKiS). asUKiS allows for scarless and allele-by-allele substitution of the entire region encompassing not only the polyQ-repeat but also the associated genetic modifiers surrounding the repeat region, allowing us to generate five iPSC lines with identical genetic modifiers on both alleles, differing only in polyQ repeat numbers. All cell lines were validated by allele-specific genotyping to confirm the precise engineering of both alleles. Even for modelling autosomal dominant diseases, our approach of employing biallelic modification may offer the distinct advantage enabling the investigation of the effects of specific genomic mutations with minimal interference from genetic background noise."

    "abstract": "Synaptic dysfunction is one of the most important markers of neurodegenerative diseases, which contribute to cognitive decline and the loss of neurons. Synaptosomal-associated protein 25 (SNAP-25) is a member of the soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) complex, which plays a significant role in the exocytosis of synaptic vesicles and the release of neurotransmitters. Recent studies have shown that expression levels of SNAP-25 are altered in various neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Huntington's disease (HD), and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). These investigations led to the consideration of SNAP-25 as a potential biomarker of synaptic degeneration. Understanding the role of SNAP-25 in neurodegeneration will aid in early diagnosis, disease monitoring, and therapeutic development, and will also provide new insights into synaptic dysfunction as a main feature of neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, this paper explores the physiological role of SNAP-25, its involvement in synaptic pathology, and the implications of its dysregulation in neurodegenerative conditions, such as AD, HD, and CJD. Literature regarding cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) SNAP-25 levels as a diagnostic marker were reviewed and its applications in detecting the progression of the disease have been discussed. Additionally, the limitations of SNAP-25 as a biomarker, including variability across studies and the need for further validation have been addressed."

Although melatonin is known to treat sleep disruptions related to circadian rhythm disorders, its effects on HD patients have not been thoroughly explored. to assess the effectiveness of melatonin in improving the sleep quality of individuals with HD. double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover trial with individuals with HD experiencing sleep disturbances, defined as Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) > 5. Participants received 4-week treatments with 5 mg immediate-release melatonin/placebo, separated by a one-week wash-out (NCT04421339). Clinical assessments were conducted at baseline, week 5 (crossover visit), and week 9 (final visit) and included the PSQI, HD Sleep Questionnaire (HD-SQ), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Neuro-QoL™ v2.0 Cognitive Function, Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Unified Huntington Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS), and Clinical Global Impression (CGI). Fifteen patients (46.53 ± 13.92 years old, seven females) completed the study procedures. We found no significant differences between melatonin and placebo treatments in the primary outcome (PSQI), other sleep measures (ESS and HD-SQ), neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPI-Q, HADS, Neuro-QoL, MoCA), and motor/functional measures. We found that melatonin did not significantly differ from placebo in improving sleep quality in individuals with HD. Given the conflicting findings from previous research, it may be beneficial to explore alternative dosages of melatonin, increase the sample size, and consider different stages of HD in future studies."

    "abstract": "Huntington's disease (HD) is a rare, fatal, chronic progressive neurodegenerative disorder with a significant unmet medical need for effective treatments. Pridopidine is a novel, first-in-class, highly selective and potent sigma-1 receptor (S1R) agonist in development for HD. Pridopidine has been extensively studied in adult HD across the full spectrum of disease severity and age ranges, and its safety profile has been characterized in approximately 1600 participants across multiple studies and a broad range of doses. The specific objective of this study was to gain an in-depth understanding of pridopidine's safety profile at the recommended human dose of 45 mg twice daily (bid) in patients with HD. An integrated safety analysis of pooled data from 1067 patients with HD enrolled in four double-blind, placebo-controlled studies was performed. The safety profile of pridopidine was compared with placebo. Pridopidine was found to be generally safe and well tolerated with an adverse event (AE) profile comparable to that of placebo. Moreover, there were no significant differences observed in the safety profile of pridopidine compared with placebo when analyzed by age, sex, baseline total functional capacity (TFC), cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) repeat length, use of antidopaminergic medications (ADMs), and region. The integrated analysis replicated and corroborated the good safety profile observed in the individual studies. Despite the larger sample size, no new safety signals emerged. Long-term exposure to pridopidine, up to 6.5 years in open-label extension studies, revealed no new safety concerns, supporting its potential for long-term use in patients with HD."

    "abstract": "Tau is a microtubule protein that is known to be hyperphosphorylated and to aggregate in several chronic neurodegenerative disorders. In many cases, in particular in Alzheimer's disease, the degree of tau pathology has been demonstrated to correlate with cognitive deficits and/or decline. In Huntington's disease (HD), a dominantly inherited neurodegenerative disorder, both cognitive impairments and abnormal tau expression have been reported to occur, along with the accumulation of the mutant huntingtin protein. In this respect, tau has been shown to be present in the cerebrospinal fluid of individuals with HD and to increase with disease progression. However, how this relates to changes in tau found in the periphery is largely unknown. In this study, we collected blood samples from patients with HD and isolated multiple blood components including plasma, platelets, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells to measure their tau levels and subsequently correlate these to cognitive impairments and disease stage. Our results suggest that the amount of tau, particularly N-terminal tau (NTA-tau) and total tau (t-tau), is elevated in all assayed blood components and that the quantity of tau within platelets, specifically, is strongly correlated with disease severity."

    "abstract": "Huntington's disease (HD) is characterized by progressive cognitive decline, with early deficits often preceding motor symptoms. The Loewenstein-Acevedo Scales for Semantic Interference and Learning (LASSI-L) captures many types of deficits in verbal memory including susceptibility to interference. The current study aims to delineate the progression of these deficits across different stages of HD. 151 participants (89 HD, 62 healthy controls) were recruited across three sites. HD participants were classified into three groups using a PIN score and TMS: >10 years from manifest HD, <10 years from manifest HD, and manifest HD. Group comparisons on the LASSI-L were assessed using multiple ANCOVAs adjusting for age, followed by post-hoc pairwise comparisons and a Bonferroni correction. Sequential group differences for susceptibility to interference effects were observed on the LASSI-L. Proactive Semantic Interference (PSI) deficits emerged >10 years before manifest HD, Failure to Recover from PSI (<i>fr</i>PSI) emerged <10 years before manifest HD, and in the Manifest HD stage, participants exhibited additional deficits in Retroactive Semantic Interference (RSI). Based on cutoff scores derived from healthy control performance, 98% (87/89) of the HD cohort demonstrated either normal performance or significant impairments, primarily in PSI, with some showing concurrent deficits in <i>fr</i>PSI and/or RSI. Furthermore, 88% of participants adhered to the full sequential decline pattern, progressing from deficits in PSI, to <i>fr</i>PSI, and then to RSI. The LASSI-L appears to be a useful tool for detecting early and progressive cognitive changes in Huntington's disease, particularly by capturing the sequential nature of verbal memory deficits, including early vulnerability to interference. These findings suggest that the LASSI-L may help refine HD staging by integrating sequential neuropsychological markers of cognitive decline."

Currently, there exists no effective therapeutic intervention that can prevent the progression of the disease. Our study aims to identify a novel genetic modifier with therapeutic potential. We employ transgenic flies containing HTT.ex1.Q93 and mRFP-HTT.588.Q138 constructs, which encode mutant pathogenic Huntingtin (Htt) proteins featuring 93 and 138 polyglutamine (Q) repeats respectively. The resultant mutant proteins cause the loss of photoreceptor neurons in the eye and a progressive loss of neuronal tissues in the brain and motor neurons in Drosophila. Several findings have demonstrated the association of HD with growth factor signaling defects. Phosphatase and tensin homolog (Pten) have been implicated in the negative regulation of the Insulin signaling/receptor tyrosine signaling pathway which regulates the growth and survival of cells. In the present study, we downregulated Pten and found a significant improvement in morphological phenotypes in the eye, brain, and motor neurons. These findings were further correlated with the enhancement of the functional vision and climbing ability of the flies. We also found the reduction in both Htt aggregate and caspase levels which are involved in the apoptotic pathway. In alignment with the genetic modulation of Pten, we elucidated the protective role of Pten inhibition through the utilization of VO-OHpic. VO-OHpic improved the climbing ability of flies and reduced the poly(Q) aggregates and apoptosis levels. A similar reduction in Htt aggregates was observed in the mouse neuronal inducible HD cell line model. Our study illustrates that Pten inhibition is a potential therapeutic approach for HD."

    "abstract": "Huntington's disease is a brain-related hereditary condition characterized by a gradual loss of mental, physical, and emotional function. Quinolinic acid is a toxic substance that is formed because of the breakdown of tryptophan, a compound involved in the metabolism of the amino acid. Diacerein is an anthraquinone which shows anti-inflammatory effects. The binding capacity of diacerein on GSK-3β is screened via Auto Dock. The purpose of the study is to check neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory properties of diacerein on QA-induced HD in adult zebra fish. In this study, 14 fish in each group were used, QA was administered by i.c.v. route as a toxin on the day 0, and diacerein (25 and 50 mg/kg) as treatment and tetrabenazine as standard were used for 14 days. We have performed three neurobehavioral parameters such as open-field (for locomotion), T-maze (for memory), and novel diving test (for anxiety), followed by biochemical parameters such as total protein estimation, LPO, GSH, nitrite, AChEs, and catalase, neurotransmitters (GABA and glutamate) along with inflammatory markers (IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-17), and histopathological evaluation at the end. Diacerein enhances motor function, modulates neurotransmitter levels, diminishes oxidative stress markers, controls the generation of inflammatory cytokines, and inhibits GSK-3β activity. Furthermore, diacerein improves the neurotoxicity and neurobehavioral impairments in adult zebra fish with Huntington's disease-like symptoms caused by quinolinic acid."

Against the backdrop of escalating zoonotic disease concerns linked to wild meat, this research aimed to unravel the structure, governance, species composition and actor characteristics of the wild meat value chain in Lagos, Africa's most populated city. We employed a cross-sectional study design incorporating qualitative and quantitative approaches. Interviews (<i>n</i> = 22) were conducted and structured questionnaires were administered to participants (<i>n</i> = 257) across 15 sites in Lagos. Participants' activities were also observed, and field notes were taken. Descriptive statistics and inductive thematic approach were used for data analysis. Findings revealed five main value chain nodes: hunter, processor, wholesale, retail and consumer; and five major geographical areas from which wild meat flowed into the city. Governance structures showed a blend of informal and formal mechanisms sustained through trust, cultural beliefs and informal regulations. The main motivation was income (88.1 %), and period of optimum activity was at night times (53 %) during the dry season (≥ 62 %). Women (62.2 %) dominated the value chain, prevalent at the wholesaler (61.7 %), processor (89.7 %) and retailer (83 %) nodes. Hunters (40 %) were able to supply wild meat directly to consumers, and the large-scale retailers (26 %) were responsible for exportation of wild meat. A total of 35 species were traded in the value chain, and the most commonly traded species were: grasscutters, duikers, porcupines, and giant-pouched rats (≥90.7 % participants). Pottos, buffalos, tortoises and house snakes were the least traded (≤ 7.0 % participants). This study provides an understanding of Lagos wildlife trade from a value chain perspective, paving the way for interventions to address wildlife conservation challenges and spillover risks. Species traded in the value chain have been globally reported as reservoirs of zoonotic pathogens, representing a source of zoonotic spillover risks to actors. Also, the ability of hunters to supply wild meat directly to consumers signals an increase in the speed of zoonotic pathogen spread, and portends a greater risk for public health. Formal governance should be integrated into the value chain to aid effective monitoring and regulation. Conservation and public health interventions should be node-specific and gender-sensitive, targeting the dry seasons when actors' activities peak, and risks of human-wild meat contact are greater. There is need for the re-assessment of the conservation statuses of West Africa's wildlife species to reflect current realities foisted by wild meat trade."

    "abstract": "The human gait cycle undergoes discernible alterations upon the onset of neurodegenerative diseases (NDD) such as Parkinson's, Huntington's, and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Each specific neurodegenerative disorder imparts a distinct influence on human gait dynamics, and precise quantification of these changes holds the potential for accurate methods of NDD detection.Nonlinear entropy algorithms, such as sample entropy (SampEn), find widespread use in physiological signal analysis. SampEn gauges signal complexity by identifying pattern matches within windowed sub-segments of the signal. However, traditional SampEn is notably dependent on user-defined parameters, particularly the tolerance parameter r, leading to inaccuracies in complexity information.SampEn profiling emerges as an alternative concept, eliminating the need for an input r parameter. This data-driven algorithm autonomously generates a set of 'r' values based on the signal's dynamics, yielding a comprehensive SampEn profile. The SampEn profile, containing extensive information about the signal's complexity, serves as a valuable resource for extracting secondary entropy features.In this study, we have contrasted the efficacy of traditional SampEn with SampEn profile-based secondary features such as Total SampEn (TSE) and Median SampEn (MSE), in identifying neurological states. Our findings consistently reveal that secondary features derived from the reduced-parametric SampEn profiling method outperform the traditional parametric SE in distinguishing control cohorts from specific Neurodegenerative Disease (NDD) cohorts."

    "abstract": "Neurodegeneration is characterized by the progressive loss of neurons commonly attributed to neurological causes. Studies published over the past two decades suggest that neurodegeneration may occur due to systemic diseases that compromise energy metabolism throughout the body. This metabolic imbalance develops over decades before neurodegeneration is clinically documented or inferred. It is now accepted that long-lasting oxidative stress and inflammation link neurodegeneration with altered energy metabolism in the body. Systemic prevention of these factors may reduce the odds of developing neurodegeneration and delay or prevent its progression as individuals age. Chlorogenic acid (CGA) is a polyphenol prevalent in fruits and vegetables that exhibits antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. It may serve as a systemic neuroprotectant when consumed regularly before the onset of neurodegeneration. To test this possibility, an experimental model of striatal early neurodegeneration induced by systemic administration of 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NP) was used. This toxin inhibits succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), disrupts electron flow and leads to increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and a pro-inflammatory environment. The severity of symptoms induced by 3-NP varies depending on dosage, duration of exposure and administration route. In the brain, 3-NP affects striatal medium spiny neurons in the basal ganglia and in less degree pyramidal neurons from frontal cortex, a feature observed in Huntington's disease (HD). The aim of this study was to investigate the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of CGA in the 3-NP-induced model of early neurodegeneration. Systemic administration of CGA significantly reduced lipid peroxidation and promoted an anti-inflammatory profile in the brain when co-administered with 3-NP. These results support that CGA could serve as a systemic neuroprotectant in individuals challenged by environmental toxins that disrupt mitochondrial function."

    "abstract": "Protein aggregation is a critical factor in the development and progression of several human diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, and type 2 diabetes. Among these conditions, AD is recognized as the most prevalent progressive neurodegenerative disorder, characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides. Neuronal toxicity is likely driven by soluble oligomeric intermediates of the Aβ peptide, which are thought to play a central role in the cascade leading to neuronal dysfunction and cognitive decline. In response, numerous therapeutic strategies have been developed to inhibit Aβ oligomerization, as this is believed to delay the formation of Aβ protofibrils. Traditional research has focused on discovering small molecules or peptides that antagonize Aβ oligomerization. However, recent studies have explored an alternative approach-developing ligands that stabilize the Aβ peptide in its α-helical conformation. This stabilization is thought to alter the peptide's natural aggregation kinetics, shifting it away from toxic oligomer formation and toward less harmful states. Crucially, by maintaining Aβ in this α-helical form, these ligands have been shown to rescue the peptide's associated cytotoxicity, offering a promising mechanism to mitigate the detrimental effects of Aβ in AD. While challenges remain, including treatment costs and side effects like ARIA (amyloid-related imaging abnormalities), anti-Aβ drug development represents a major advancement in Alzheimer's research and therapeutic options. This brief review aims to highlight the development and potential of these α-helix-stabilizing ligands as antagonists of Aβ aggregation, focusing on their interactions with Aβ and how these compounds induce and maintain secondary structural changes in the Aβ peptide. Notably, this innovative strategy holds promise beyond Aβ-related pathology, as the fundamental principles could be applied to other amyloidogenic proteins implicated in various amyloid-related diseases, potentially broadening the scope of therapeutic intervention for multiple neurodegenerative conditions."

A publicly available gait dataset consisting of four groups: healthy adults, people with Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) was used. The topological properties of the configuration space of three gait parameters were studied by approximating the underlying distribution through a Gaussian kernel-based density estimation technique. Thereafter, sublevel sets of the density estimate were analyzed using cubical persistence homology. Three new features were constructed: 1. Probability density estimates (PDEs) that characterize the distribution of gait parameters over their configuration space. Healthy adults exhibited a unimodal distribution, while people with neurodegenerative disorders displayed a multi-modal distribution. 2. Persistence entropy plots that summarize changes in the PDEs and characterize the uncertainty in the underlying distribution. Gait of healthy adults was concentrated at higher entropy values as opposed to neurodegenerative gait. 3. A number that captures disease severity trends. Topological features in PD and HD indicate a 'bias' to a certain set of gait configurations. This lack of exploration may reflect poor planning of the underlying topology, resulting in outward manifestations of impaired gait. The lower variegations in PDEs in ALS compared to PD and HD suggest that the planning of the topology of gait may occur at higher levels of the neural architecture. TGA offers characterization of gait at a hitherto uncharted level, potentially serving neuromotor markers for early diagnosis and personalized rehabilitation protocols."

Additionally, strategies to overcome its low bioavailability and blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability were evaluated.<b>Results</b>: Curcumin inhibits Aβ aggregation and promotes disaggregation, reducing amyloid plaque formation in Alzheimer's disease. It modulates glial cell activity, attenuating neuroinflammation and fostering a neuroprotective environment. By interacting with tau proteins, curcumin prevents hyperphosphorylation and neurofibrillary tangle formation. As a potent antioxidant, it scavenges reactive oxygen species, mitigating oxidative stress-related neuronal damage. Its metal-chelating properties further diminish neurotoxicity by sequestering iron and copper ions. Despite its limited bioavailability and BBB permeability, curcumin's therapeutic efficacy can be enhanced using nanocarriers such as nanoparticles, liposomes, and micelles, which improve solubility, stability, and brain penetration.<b>Conclusion</b>: Curcumin's multifaceted neuroprotective mechanisms make it a promising candidate for preventing or slowing neurodegenerative disease progression. Advanced drug delivery systems hold potential for overcoming its pharmacokinetic limitations, paving the way for future clinical applications."

    "abstract": "In 2013, the Trial to Assess Chelation Therapy (TACT) reported that in 1708 patients with stable coronary disease and prior myocardial infarction (MI), oral multivitamins and multiminerals (OMVMs), in a factorial design with edetate disodium (EDTA) chelation therapy, did not reduce cardiovascular events relative to placebo OMVMs, but active EDTA combined with active OMVMs was superior to placebo OMVM/placebo EDTA. To compare OMVM vs placebo in terms of efficacy for reducing major adverse cardiovascular events in patients with diabetes and prior MI. The TACT2 randomized, multicenter double-masked 2 × 2 factorial clinical trial took place across 88 sites in the US and Canada. Participants were 50 years or older, had diabetes, and had an MI 6 weeks ago or more. TACT2 participants were enrolled between September 2016 and December 2020. Data were collected between October 2016 and June 2023. Six caplets daily of a 28 component OMVM or matching OMVM placebo, and 40 weekly infusions of an EDTA-based chelation solution or matching placebo, in a 1:1:1:1 allocation ratio. The primary end point was the composite of all-cause mortality, MI, stroke, coronary revascularization, or hospitalization for unstable angina. A total of 1000 participants were randomized (500 in the active OMVM group and 500 in the placebo group). The median (IQR) age was 67 (60-72) years, and 730 (73%) were male. Median (IQR) follow-up was 48 (34-58) months. The primary end point occurred in 175 participants (35%) in the active OMVM group and 175 (35%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.99 [95% CI, 0.80-1.22]; P = .92). The 5-year event rate for the primary end point in the EDTA chelation + active OMVM group was 34.0%; in the EDTA chelation + placebo OMVM group, 35.7%; in the placebo infusion + active OMVM group, 36.0%; and in the placebo infusion + placebo OMVM group, 34.3%. The comparison of the active infusion + active OMVM with the placebo infusion + placebo OMVM was not significant (HR, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.67-1.23]; P = .54). Although nonsignificant, there was a numerically higher event rate of MI, stroke, mortality from cardiovascular causes in the active OMVM compared to placebo OMVM group. The results of this randomized clinical trial demonstrated that, for participants with chronic coronary disease, diabetes, and a previous MI, high-dose OMVM alone or in conjunction with EDTA-based chelation did not reduce cardiovascular events.

    "title": "Action impulsivity and attention deficits in patients at an early stage of Huntington disease.",
    "abstract": "Huntington's disease (HD) is characterized by a combination of motor, cognitive, and neuropsychiatric impairments. Among them, impulsivity and attention deficits are clinical features usually described in HD, impacting the quality of life of patients and their caregivers. Twenty early-stage HD patients (PHD) and 20 age and gender-matched control participants (CP) performed a \"Simon\" reaction time (RT) task allowing us to explore action impulsivity and attention deficits. Surface EMG recordings aimed at revealing the presence and characterizing the nature of impulsivity in PHD. Correlational analyses between error rates or chronometric data, and clinical or neuropsychological data were examined. (1) Analysis of the accuracy and EMG patterns revealed no difference between PHD and CP, indicating absence of motor impulsivity at the early stage of HD. (2) Chronometric indices revealed a general slowing of information processing in PHD, involving central information processing but sparing the latest stages of motor execution, consistent with performed correlational analysis. (3) Sequential analysis of RT patterns showed a failure to allocate attention appropriately. These indices of attentional deficits nicely correlated with performance in neuropsychological tests exploring attentional processes. (1) Central information processing slows down at the early stage of HD but the latest steps of motor execution are unaffected. (2) In the progression of HD, attentional deficits typically should appear first among dysexecutive problems, without significant action impulsivity."

    "abstract": "In Huntington's disease (HD), cognitive symptoms, sleep fragmentation, and daily activity pattern alterations can occur up to 15 years before diagnosis in premanifest HD (Pre-HD). Whether sleep and rest-activity patterns relate to cognitive function in Pre-HD, however, remains unclear. We investigated the relationships between rest-activity patterns, sleep, and cognitive function in Pre-HD compared to healthy controls (HCs). All participants completed 14 days of actigraphy, online questionnaires, and remote cognitive assessments. The Pre-HD group (<i>n</i> = 36) performed worse on Speeded Tapping than the HC group (<i>n</i> = 42). Pre-HD participants with heightened sleep fragmentation performed more poorly on the Trail Making Test (TMT) and Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised (HVLT-R). In Pre-HD, lower intra-daily variability and higher interdaily stability (more stable, less fragmented rest-activity patterns) were associated with poorer performance on the trail making test Part B, Symbol Digit Modalities Test, Emotion Recognition Task, Rey Complex Figure Test, visual memory task, paced tapping, and HVLT-R total trial. Higher interdaily stability was also linked to poorer HVLT-R performance. Relative amplitude and sleep regularity index were not related to performance. Poorer sleep quality on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index correlated with worse HVLT-R delayed and paced tapping scores. More severe insomnia (higher Insomnia Severity Index scores) correlated with lower Rey Complex Figure Test copy. Our findings emphasize the importance of uninterrupted sleep on cognitive function in Pre-HD and reveal targets for interventions aimed at improving cognitive symptoms. Larger cohorts stratified by proximity to diagnosis are critical to improving our understanding of these relationships across the premanifest period.

    "abstract": "Genomic screens and GWAS are powerful tools for identifying disease-modifying genes, but it is often challenging to understand the pathways by which these genes function. Here, we take an integrated approach that combines network analysis and an imaging-based pooled genetic perturbation study to examine modifiers of Huntington's disease (HD). The computational analysis highlighted several genes in a subnetwork enriched for modifiers of neuronal development and morphology. To test the functional roles of these genes, we developed an experimental pipeline that allows pooled CRISPRi KD of 21 genes in human iPSC-derived neurons followed by optical analysis of genotypes, neuronal arborization, multiplexed pathway activity and morphological fingerprint readout. This approach recovered known genes involved in morphology and confirmed unexpected links from the network between several genetic modifiers of HD and morphology. Our approach overcomes challenges in pooled measurement of neuronal function and health and could be adapted for other phenotypes in HD and other neurological diseases."

    "abstract": "The day-to-day experience of symptoms and functioning are largely understudied in people with Huntington disease (HD). Real-world capture of day-to-day symptoms and functioning could be valuable as future HD outcome measures. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to 1) examine the feasibility of a weeklong intensive study design; and 2) understand the daily variation of symptoms and functioning in individuals with premanifest and manifest HD. During this 8-day study, 52 individuals with HD completed real-time symptom reports 3 times each day (chorea, sleep, fatigue, anxiety), wore a wrist-worn device (PRO-Diary sleep and physical activity), and completed daily diaries of symptoms (chorea, sleep, fatigue, anger, depression, anxiety) and functioning (physical activity, speech/swallowing, and social participation) each night. We examined rates of missing data, and multilevel models were used to analyze data. Rates of missing data were 23-52 % for the real-time symptom reports and 19-35 % for the daily diaries. Average PRO-Diary wear compliance was 64 % for manifest and 67 % for pre-manifest HD for sleep, and 71 % for pre-manifest and 78 % for manifest HD for physical activity. Within-subject variability was greater over the week (day-to-day median range 1.9-4.4 SDs) than over the day (within-a-day median range 0-2 SDs). Associations between baseline and real-time reports of the same constructs were generally consistent. Rates of missing data were consistent with similar study designs in other clinical populations, supporting feasibility. Missingness was highest for the real-time symptom reports. HD participants experienced more day-to-day variation in symptoms and function, with less variability within a day, suggesting that once-daily assessments may suffice."

We explore techniques for the management of a 21-year-old parturient with symptomatic HD who underwent successful neuraxial anesthesia for labor and subsequent cesarean delivery. We provide guidance on perioperative medications for comorbidities associated with HD. Dexmedetomidine, which we administered neuraxially, appears to have significant potential for the perioperative diminution of choreiform movements. Current anesthetic management of HD cannot be informed by traditional research methodology and therefore much information must be gleaned from the limited available case reports."

Among these, triplex-forming oligonucleotides (TFOs) represent common antigene strategies because they bind specifically to the major groove position of genomic DNA to form a triplex DNA structure. Thus far, this promising triplex formation technique represents a successful strategy with strong application prospects for gene manipulation applications (e.g., cancer, Huntington's disease, inflammatory disease, etc.), analytical detection (e.g., nucleic acid, small molecules, etc.), and nanotechnology (e.g., molecular machines, etc.). This review summarizes in detail the full range of potential applications described above, particularly the various chemical modification strategies that have facilitated the stepwise advancement of TFO-based oligonucleotide drugs in recent years to improve the effectiveness, specificity, and applicability of triplex DNA and synergistically promote the effectiveness of triplex DNA."

Since 2014, more than 30 neurologic medications have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for neurologic conditions. This study aims to characterize recent trends in annual costs and aggregate spending from 2012 to 2021 for new-to-market (NTM) medications for 9 neurologic conditions. We used the Merative MarketScan commercial and Medicare supplemental databases to observe patients seen by a neurologist with neurologic diseases with newly FDA-approved medications from 2014 to 2021: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR), Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), Huntington disease (HD), myasthenia gravis (MG), migraine, orthostatic hypotension (OH), tardive dyskinesia (TD), and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). Patients were included if they had ≥1 disease-related prescription medication fill from 2012 to 2021. NTM (medications approved from 2014 to 2021) and older evidence-based guideline-supported medications were observed annually. Outcomes examined were annual and aggregate out-of-pocket (OOP) and total medication costs. We identified 2,687 unique individuals with ALS, 38 with ATTR, 69 with DMD, 884 with HD, 9,984 with MG, 441,099 with migraine, 4,723 with OH, 1,266 with TD, and 17 with SMA. The youngest population was DMD (mean = 25 years [SD = 7]), and the oldest was TD (mean = 66 years [SD = 14]). For DMD, the population was 99% male and for migraine, the population was 84% female, and the other conditions had more relatively even sex divides. Collectively, migraine medications had the largest increase in aggregate costs (1993%) and had a substantial increase in OOP costs on average by 234% ($86-$288). Eculizumab for MG was an extreme outlier, with OOP costs increasing by 4,099% ($413-$17,359) and aggregate OOP costs by 7,005% ($5,375-$381,894). OOP costs of edaravone ($304-$5,707) and deutetrabenazine ($670-$7,170) sharply increased by 1,775% and 971%, respectively. NTM medications for neurologic conditions have substantial and increasing individual and societal costs, which was not observed for older generic medications. These data suggest a need for policies to limit the financial burden of NTM medications on patients with neurologic conditions."

    "title": "Anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects of baicalein: targeting Nrf2, and NFĸB in neurodegenerative disease.",
    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease, are characterized by progressive loss of neurons in the brain regions, including the hippocampus, cortex, substantia nigra, and striatum. Multiple pathological mechanisms drive this neuronal loss, including oxidative stress, chronic inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, protein misfolding, and excitotoxicity. Recent evidence suggests that these processes are intricately linked to the dysregulation of key signalling pathways, such as the IĸB/NFĸB, and KEAP1/Nrf2 pathways, which play central roles in neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial functions, respectively. At present, no cure exists for neurodegenerative disorders, and available medications focus solely on symptomatic management. While these treatments provide temporary relief, their long-term use is often associated with adverse health effects. In this context, natural Phytoactive constituents like Baicalein, a bioactive flavonoid derived from Scutellaria baicalensis, have gained attention for their promising therapeutic potential. Baicalein has been shown to modulate the IĸB/NFĸB, and KEAP1/Nrf2 pathways, thereby mitigating neuroinflammation and oxidative stress while supporting mitochondrial health. It exerts anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting NFĸB activation, thereby reducing the production of proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and NLRP3 inflammasome, and enzymes like COX-2, LOX, and iNOS, which are essential for innate and adaptive immune responses. Simultaneously, baicalein enhances the Nrf2 activation, promoting the expression of antioxidant enzymes like HO-1, NQO1, GPx, and SOD, thus countering oxidative stress. These findings highlight the potential of baiclalein as a complementary approach for managing neurodegenerative diseases, offering a safer and more holistic alternative to conventional therapies."

Although several mechanisms potentially involved in disease development have been identified, its pathogenesis is not fully understood. From the patient side, ALS diagnosis, still based on clinical criteria, can be difficult and may take up to 1 year. More than 30 genes have been associated to genetically inherited ALS, among which four (C9ORF72, SOD1, TARDBP and FUS) would explain around 60-70% of cases. However, familial ALS represents only 5-10% of ALS cases while the remaining are sporadic, with genetics explaining 6-10% of such cases only. In this context, short tandem repeats (STRs) expansions, have recently been found in clinically diagnosed ALS patients. In this review, we discuss the recent discoveries on ALS associated STRs and their potential as biomarkers as well as prognosis and therapy targets."

There is emerging evidence indicating a protective role of PGC-1α in the pathogenesis of several neurological diseases. As such, a deeper and broader understanding of PGC-1α and its role in neurological diseases is urgently needed. The present review provides a relatively complete overview of the current knowledge on PGC-1α, including its functions in different types of neurons, basic structural characteristics, and its interacting transcription factors. Furthermore, we present the role of PGC-1α in the pathogenesis of various neurological diseases, such as intracerebral hemorrhage, ischemic stroke, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington's disease, and other PolyQ diseases. Importantly, we discuss some compounds or drug-targeting strategies that have been studied to ameliorate the pathology of these neurological diseases and introduce the possible mechanistic pathways. Based on the available studies, we propose that targeting PGC-1α could serve as a promising novel therapeutic strategy for one or more neurological diseases."

    "title": "The therapeutic potential of (R)-carvedilol in Huntington's disease through enhancement of autophagy-lysosomal pathway via GSK-3β inhibition.",
    "abstract": "Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by the abnormal expansion of CAG repeats in the huntingtin (Htt) gene, leading to the aggregation of mutant huntingtin protein (mHTT) in cells, particularly in cortical and striatal neurons. This results in involuntary movements, cognitive impairment, and emotional instability. One of the critical pathogenic mechanisms in HD is impaired autophagy, which plays a vital role in cellular homeostasis by degrading damaged organelles and misfolded proteins through the formation of autophagosomes that fuse with lysosomes. However, the aggregation of mHTT disrupts autophagic function, leading to the accumulation of mHTT and exacerbating the disease's pathogenesis. Carvedilol is an established clinical medication used to treat hypertension and congestive heart failure. It exerts protective effects by blocking both β1-and β2-adrenergic receptors, reducing sympathetic nervous activity, and promoting vasodilation through α1-adrenergic blockade. Carvedilol has been shown to possess antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. In this study, we demonstrate that (R)-carvedilol promotes the nuclear translocation of the transcription factor binding to IGHM enhancer 3 (TFE3) by reducing glycogen synthase-3β (GSK-3β) activation, which increases the expression of autophagy-related proteins and facilitates the autophagy-lysosomal pathway (ALP), thereby enhancing mHTT degradation. Additionally, systemic administration of (R)-carvedilol improves mHTT degradation, provides neuroprotection, and inhibits gliosis, effectively ameliorating behavioral impairments and improving disease progression. Overall, these findings indicate that (R)-carvedilol has therapeutic potential for managing HD by promoting autophagy, facilitating the clearance of mHTT aggregates, and demonstrating advantageous properties in an HD transgenic mouse model, highlighting its promise as a treatment option for neurodegenerative diseases."

However, the existing HD detection methods are struggle with limited annotated datasets that restricts their generalization performance. This research work proposes a novel MIMI-ONET for primary detection of HD using augmented multi-modal brain MRI images. The two-dimensional stationary wavelet transform (2DSWT) decomposes the MRI images into different frequency wavelet sub-bands. These sub-bands are enhanced with Contract Stretching Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CSAHE) and Multi-scale Adaptive Retinex (MSAR) by reducing the irrelevant distortions. The proposed MIMI-ONET introduces a Hepta Generative Adversarial Network (Hepta-GAN) to generates different noise-free HD images based on hepta azimuth angles (45°, 90°, 135°, 180°, 225°, 270°, 315°). Hepta-GAN incorporates Affine Estimation Module (AEM) to extract the multi-scale features using dilated convolutional layers for efficient HD image generation. Moreover, Hepta-GAN is normalized with Butterfly Optimization (BO) algorithm for enhancing augmentation performance by balancing the parameters. Finally, the generated images are given to Deep neural network (DNN) for the classification of normal control (NC), Adult-Onset HD (AHD) and Juvenile HD (JHD) cases. The ability of the proposed MIMI-ONET is evaluated with precision, specificity, f1 score, recall, and accuracy, PSNR and MSE. From the experimental results, the proposed MIMI-ONET attains the accuracy of 98.85% and reaches PSNR value of 48.05 based on the gathered Image-HD dataset. The proposed MIMI-ONET increases the overall accuracy of 9.96%, 1.85%, 5.91%, 13.80% and 13.5% for 3DCNN, KNN, FCN, RNN and ML framework respectively."

Moreover, social participation is associated with late-life cognition and could mediate the association between education and cognitive function. Yet, few studies have formally tested this question within a causal mediation framework. We used data from the Taiwan Longitudinal Study in Aging. Participants were aged 50 or above and recruited in 1989 (n = 4,400), stratified by age group (aged 50-64 years versus 65 or above). We used sequence analysis and optimal matching techniques to define clustered patterns of social participation and work trajectories. We then used a four-way decomposition to identify causal mediation of the association between educational attainment and cognitive function by social participation. Cognitive function was measured by the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire. The mediating pathway through social participation accounted for 5% or less of the total relation of education on late-life cognitive function for both younger and older subgroups. The interaction between education and social participation accounted for 22% (middle/high school) and 34% (college+) of the total effect, contrasting with no formal education. We estimated that 36% (95% C.I. = 0.09, 0.69) of the educational disparity in late-life cognition among the younger cohort could be eliminated if the least educated group's social participation matched that of the college or above group. Social participation was not a significant mediator in the older subgroup. To mitigate educational disparities in late-life cognitive function, further exploration of encouraging more active social participation or stable employment should be undertaken."

We delved into the dysregulation of specific miRNAs in HD, for instance, downregulated levels of miR-9 and miR-124 and increased levels of miR-155 and miR-196a. These alterations highlight the promise of miRNAs as non-invasive tools for early HD detection and disease progression monitoring. Moving beyond diagnosis, the exciting potential of miRNA-based therapies. By mimicking downregulated miRNAs or inhibiting dysregulated ones, we can potentially restore the balance of mutant target gene expression and modify disease progression.

Neuroglial crosstalk is physiologically ensured by extracellular mediators and by the activity of connexins (Cxs), the forming proteins of gap junctions (Gjs) and hemichannels (HCs), which maintain intracellular and extracellular homeostasis. However, accumulating evidence suggests that Cxs can also act as pathological pore in neuroinflammatory conditions, thereby contributing to neurodegenerative phenomena such as synaptic dysfunction, oxidative stress, and ultimately cell death.

    "abstract": "Among neurotrophins, including nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), and neurotrophin-4 (NT-4/5), BDNF has been extensively studied for its physiological role in cell survival and synaptic regulation in the central nervous system's (CNS's) neurons. BDNF binds to TrkB (a tyrosine kinase) with high affinity, and the resulting downstream intracellular signaling cascades play crucial roles in determining cell fate, including neuronal differentiation and maturation of the CNS neurons. It has been well demonstrated that the downregulation/dysregulation of the BDNF/TrkB system is implicated in the pathogenesis of neurologic and psychiatric disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and depression. Interestingly, the effects of BDNF mimetic compounds including flavonoids, small molecules which can activate TrkB-mediated signaling, have been extensively investigated as potential therapeutic strategies for brain diseases, given that p75NTR, a common neurotrophin receptor, also contributes to cell death under a variety of pathological conditions such as neurodegeneration. Since the downregulation of the BDNF/TrkB system is associated with the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases and psychiatric disorders, understanding how alterations in the BDNF/TrkB system contribute to disease progression could provide valuable insight for the prevention of these brain diseases. The present review shows recent advances in the molecular mechanisms underlying the BDNF/TrkB system in neuronal survival and plasticity, providing critical insights into the potential therapeutic impact of BDNF mimetics in the pathophysiology of brain diseases."

    "abstract": "Fragile X, Huntington disease, and myotonic dystrophy type 1 are prototypical examples of human disorders caused by short tandem repeat variation, repetitive nucleotide stretches that are highly mutable both in the germline and somatic tissue. As short tandem repeats are unstable, they can expand, contract, and acquire and lose epigenetic marks in somatic tissue. This means within an individual, the genotype and epigenetic state at these loci can vary considerably from cell to cell. This somatic mosaicism may play a key role in clinical pathogenesis, and yet, our understanding of mosaicism in driving clinical phenotypes in short tandem repeat disorders is only just emerging. This review focuses on these three relatively well-studied examples where, given the advent of new technologies and bioinformatic approaches, a critical role for mosaicism is coming into focus both with respect to cellular physiology and clinical phenotypes."

    "abstract": "Short tandem repeat expansions are the most common cause of inherited neurological diseases. These disorders are clinically and genetically heterogeneous, such as in myotonic dystrophy and spinocerebellar ataxia, and they are caused by different repeat motifs in different genomic locations. Major advances in bioinformatic tools used to detect repeat expansions from short read sequencing data in the last few years have led to the implementation of these workflows into next generation sequencing pipelines in healthcare. Here, we aimed to evaluate the clinical utility of analysing repeat expansions through exome sequencing in a large cohort of genetically undiagnosed patients with neurological disorders. We here analyse 27 disease-causing DNA repeats found in the coding, intronic and untranslated regions in 12,496 exomes in patients with a range of neurogenetic conditions. We identified-and validated by polymerase chain reaction-29 repeat expansions across a range of loci, 48% (<i>n</i> = 14) of which were diagnostic. We then analysed the genotyping performance across all repeat loci and found that, despite high coverage in most repeats in coding regions, some loci had low genotyping rates, such as those that cause spinocerebellar ataxia 2 (<i>ATXN2,</i> 0.1-8.4%) and Huntington disease (<i>HTT</i>, 0.2-58.2%), depending on the capture kit. Conversely, while most intronic repeats were not genotyped, we found a high genotyping rate in the intronic locus that causes spinocerebellar ataxia 36 (<i>NOP56,</i> 30.1-98.3%) and in the one that causes myotonic dystrophy type 1 (<i>DMPK,</i> myotonic dystrophy type 1). We show that the key factors that influence the genotyping rate of repeat expansion loci analysis are the sequencing read length and exome capture kit. These results provide important information about the performance of exome sequencing as a genetic test for repeat expansion disorders."

Recent breakthroughs in genomic and transcriptomic technologies, including whole-genome sequencing, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), and CRISPR-based screens, have revolutionized the field, offering new avenues for early diagnosis and personalized prognosis. Genomic approaches have elucidated disease-specific genetic risk factors and molecular pathways, while transcriptomic studies have identified stage-specific biomarkers that correlate with disease progression and severity. Furthermore, genome-wide association studies (GWAS), polygenic risk scores (PRS), and spatial transcriptomics are enabling the stratification of patients based on their risk profiles and prognostic trajectories. Advances in functional genomics have uncovered actionable targets, such as ATXN2 in ALS and TREM2 in AD, paving the way for tailored therapeutic strategies. Despite these achievements, challenges remain in translating genomic discoveries into clinical practice due to disease heterogeneity and the complexity of neurodegenerative pathophysiology. Future integration of genetic technologies holds promise for transforming diagnostic and prognostic paradigms, offering hope for improved patient outcomes and precision medicine approaches."

    "title": "Endothelial Dysfunction in Huntington's Disease: Pathophysiology and Therapeutic Implications.",
    "abstract": "Huntington's disease (HD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor, cognitive, and psychiatric symptoms. While traditionally viewed through the lens of neuronal dysfunction, emerging evidence highlights the critical role of endothelial dysfunction in HD pathogenesis. This review provides a comprehensive overview of endothelial dysfunction in HD, drawing on findings from both animal models and human studies. Key features of endothelial dysfunction in HD include impaired angiogenesis, altered cerebral blood flow, compromised neurovascular coupling and cerebrovascular reactivity, and increased blood-brain barrier permeability. Genetic factors such as the mutant huntingtin protein, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α), Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and the adenosine A2A receptor (ADORA2A) interact to influence endothelial function in complex ways. Various therapeutic approaches targeting endothelial dysfunction, including antioxidants, nitric oxide enhancers, calcium channel blockers, statins, and metformin, have shown promise in preclinical HD models but face translational challenges, particularly regarding optimal timing of intervention and patient stratification. The implications of these findings suggest that reconceptualizing HD as a neurovascular disorder, rather than purely neuronal, could lead to more effective treatment strategies. Future research priorities should include: (1) developing validated vascular biomarkers for disease progression, (2) advancing neuroimaging techniques to monitor endothelial dysfunction in real-time. These directions will be crucial for bridging the current gap between preclinical promise and clinical success in vascular-targeted HD therapeutics."

    "abstract": "<b>Background/Objectives</b>: Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by the expansion of the CAG nucleotide repeat in the first exon of the huntingtin (<i>HTT</i>) gene. The disease typically manifests between the second and third decades of life and progresses gradually. The pathogenesis of HD involves the dysregulation of gene expression, influenced by various molecular processes ranging from transcription to protein stability. <b>Methods</b>: To investigate potential variations in gene expression associated with HD, a transcriptome study was conducted using peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples from 15 HD patients and 15 controls, all of Sicilian origin. <b>Results</b>: The analysis identified 7179 statistically significant differentially expressed genes between the two groups. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and Gene Ontology (GO) terms were applied to identify the pathways affected by these differentially expressed mRNAs. The GSEA results highlighted significant associations between HD and GO pathways related to ribosomal functions and structure. These pathways were predominantly characterized by negative expression, with a substantial number of genes showing dysregulation. This suggests that the molecular processes leading to protein translation via ribosomes may be impaired in HD. Furthermore, dysregulation was observed in genes and non-coding RNAs involved in regulatory roles across various transcriptional processes. <b>Conclusions</b>: These findings support the hypothesis that the entire process, from transcription to translation, is disrupted in HD patients carrying the CAG repeat expansion in the first exon of the <i>HTT</i> gene."

This study evaluated the survival, integration, and functional properties of cryopreserved forebrain GABAergic neurons (iGABAs) derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) across three species used in translational research. iGABAs were stereotactically injected into the striatum of Sprague-Dawley rats, immunodeficient RNU rats, R6/2 Huntington's disease (HD) mice, wild-type controls, and Cynomolgus monkeys. Post-transplantation, long-term assessments revealed robust neuronal survival, extensive neurite outgrowth, and integration with host CNS environments. In immunodeficient rats, iGABAs innervated the neuraxis, extending from the prefrontal cortex to the midbrain, while maintaining mature neuronal phenotypes without uncontrolled proliferation. Similarly, grafts in nonhuman primates showed localized survival and stable phenotype at one month. In the neurodegenerative milieu of HD mice, iGABAs survived up to six months, projecting into the host striatum and white matter, with evidence of mutant huntingtin aggregates localized within the graft, indicating pathological protein transfer. These findings underscore the utility of cryopreserved iGABAs as a reproducible, scalable model for disease-specific CNS investigations and mechanistic studies of proteinopathic propagation. This work establishes a critical platform for studying neurodegenerative diseases and developing therapeutic interventions."

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative disorders (NDs) cause progressive neuronal loss and are a significant public health concern, with NDs projected to become the second leading global cause of death within two decades. Huntington's disease (HD) is a rare, progressive ND caused by an autosomal-dominant mutation in the huntingtin (<i>HTT</i>) gene, leading to severe neuronal loss in the brain and resulting in debilitating motor, cognitive, and psychiatric symptoms. Given the complex pathology of HD, biomarkers are essential for performing early diagnosis, monitoring disease progression, and evaluating treatment efficacy. However, the identification of consistent HD biomarkers is challenging due to the prolonged premanifest HD stage, HD's heterogeneous presentation, and its multiple underlying biological pathways. This study involves a 10-year bibliometric analysis of HD biomarker research, revealing key research trends and gaps. The study also features a comprehensive literature review of emerging HD biomarkers, concluding the need for better stratification of HD patients and well-designed longitudinal studies to validate HD biomarkers. Promising candidate wet HD biomarkers- including neurofilament light chain protein (NfL), microRNAs, the mutant HTT protein, and specific metabolic and inflammatory markers- are discussed, with emphasis on their potential utility in the premanifest HD stage. Additionally, biomarkers reflecting brain structural deficits and motor or behavioral impairments, such as neurophysiological (e.g., motor tapping, speech, EEG, and event-related potentials) and imaging (e.g., MRI, PET, and diffusion tensor imaging) biomarkers, are evaluated. The findings underscore that the discovery and validation of reliable HD biomarkers urgently require improved patient stratification and well-designed longitudinal studies. Reliable biomarkers, particularly in the premanifest HD stage, are crucial for optimizing HD clinical management strategies, enabling personalized treatment approaches, and advancing clinical trials of HD-modifying therapies."

    "abstract": "Amphibians use their skin as an effective defense mechanism against predators and microorganisms. Specialized glands produce antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) that possess antioxidant properties, effectively reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. These peptides are promising candidates for treating diseases associated with oxidative stress (OS) and redox imbalance, including neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), as well as age-related conditions, like cardiovascular diseases and cancer. This review highlights the multifaceted roles of AMPs and antioxidant peptides (AOPs) in amphibians, emphasizing their protective capabilities against oxidative damage. They scavenge ROS, activate antioxidant enzyme systems, and inhibit cellular damage. AOPs often share structural characteristics with AMPs, suggesting a potential evolutionary connection and similar biosynthetic pathways. Peptides such as brevinin-1FL and Cath-KP demonstrate neuroprotective effects, indicating their therapeutic potential in managing oxidative stress-related diseases. The antioxidant properties of amphibian-derived peptides pave the way for novel therapeutic developments.

However, wearable sensors offer the opportunity to monitor real-world data that complements clinical assessments, providing a more comprehensive understanding of disease symptoms. In this study, we monitor upper limb function in individuals with Huntington's disease (HD, n = 16), prodromal HD (pHD, n = 7), and controls (CTR, n = 16) using a wrist-worn wearable sensor over a 7-day period. Goal-directed hand movements are detected through a deep learning model, and kinematic features of each movement are analyzed. The collected data is used to predict disease groups and clinical scores using statistical and machine learning models. Here we show that significant differences in goal-directed movement features exist between the groups. Additionally, several of these features strongly correlate with clinical scores. Classification models accurately distinguish between HD, pHD, and CTR individuals, achieving a balanced accuracy of 67% and a recall of 0.72 for the HD group. Regression models effectively predict clinical scores. This study demonstrates the potential of wearable sensors and machine learning to monitor upper limb function in Huntington's disease, offering a tool for early detection, remote monitoring, and assessing treatment efficacy in clinical trials."

These conditions, distinguished by unique clinical and pathological features, exhibit shared pathways leading to neuronal damage, all of which are closely associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. The high metabolic requirements of neurons make even minor mitochondrial deficiencies highly impactful, driving oxidative stress, energy deficits, and aberrant protein processing. Growing evidence from genetic, biochemical, and cellular investigations associates impaired electron transport chain activity and disrupted quality-control mechanisms, such as mitophagy, with the initial phases of disease progression. Furthermore, the overproduction of reactive oxygen species and persistent neuroinflammation can establish feedforward cycles that exacerbate neuronal deterioration. Recent clinical research has increasingly focused on interventions aimed at enhancing mitochondrial resilience-through antioxidants, small molecules that modulate the balance of mitochondrial fusion and fission, or gene-based therapeutic strategies. Concurrently, initiatives to identify dependable mitochondrial biomarkers seek to detect pathological changes prior to the manifestation of overt symptoms. By integrating the current body of knowledge, this review emphasizes the critical role of preserving mitochondrial homeostasis as a viable therapeutic approach. It also addresses the complexities of translating these findings into clinical practice and underscores the potential of innovative strategies designed to delay or potentially halt neurodegenerative processes."

Reduced trophic support due to decreased striatal levels of neurotrophins (NTs), mainly brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), contributes importantly to HD pathogenesis; restoring NTs has significant therapeutic potential. Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) offer a scalable platform for NT delivery but have potential safety risks including teratoma formation. We engineered hPSCs to constitutively produce BDNF and contain inducible safeguards to eliminate these cells if safety concerns arise. This study examined the efficacy of intrastriatally transplanted striatal progenitor cells (STRpcs) derived from these hPSCs against HD phenotypes in R6/2 mice. Engrafted STRpcs overexpressing BDNF alleviated motor and cognitive deficits and reduced mutant huntingtin aggregates. Activating the inducible safety switch with rapamycin safely eliminated the engrafted cells. These results demonstrate that BDNF delivery via a novel hPSC-based platform incorporating safety switches could be a safe and effective HD therapeutic."

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by the progressive breakdown of neuronal structure and function and the pathological accumulation of misfolded protein aggregates and toxic protein oligomers. A major contributor to the deterioration of neuronal physiology is the disruption of protein catabolic pathways mediated by the proteasome, a large protease complex responsible for most cellular protein degradation. Previously, it was believed that proteolysis by the proteasome required tagging of protein targets with polyubiquitin chains, a pathway called the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). Because of this, most research on proteasomal roles in neurodegeneration has historically focused on the UPS. However, additional ubiquitin-independent pathways and their importance in neurodegeneration are increasingly recognized. In this review, we discuss the range of ubiquitin-independent proteasome pathways, focusing on substrate identification and targeting, regulatory molecules and adaptors, proteasome activators and alternative caps, and diverse proteasome complexes including the 20S proteasome, the neuronal membrane proteasome, the immunoproteasome, extracellular proteasomes, and hybrid proteasomes. These pathways are further discussed in the context of aging, oxidative stress, protein aggregation, and age-associated neurodegenerative diseases, with a special focus on Alzheimer's Disease, Huntington's Disease, and Parkinson's Disease. A mechanistic understanding of ubiquitin-independent proteasome function and regulation in neurodegeneration is critical for the development of therapies to treat these devastating conditions. This review summarizes the current state of ubiquitin-independent proteasome research in neurodegeneration."

Nine initially manifested with chorea, whereas one manifested initially with behavioral change. At the time of consult, eight already had cognitive changes exemplified by memory lapses, while six also manifested behavioral or psychiatric disturbances. Workup revealed caudate atrophy in six and cerebral atrophy in five of the cases. All tested positive on genetic testing with the CAG trinucleotide spanning 41 to 53 repeats. The clinical profile of our patients did not differ from the known and published natural course of HD. To date, HD remains underrecognized in the Philippines. Although rare in Asian countries, it should still be a differential for a patient with chorea, cognitive decline, behavioral changes, and a strong family history of the same symptomatology."

This review explores the complex relationship between polyamine signaling and Huntington's disease (HD), an autosomal-dominant neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the progressive degeneration of medium-spiny neurons in the striatum and cortex due to mutations in the huntingtin gene. We provide a comprehensive overview of how polyamines, specificallyputrescine,spermidine, andspermine, regulate important cellular functions such as gene expression, protein synthesis, membrane stability, and ion channel regulation with implications for HD. Dysfunction in polyamine metabolism in HD, reveals how changes in these molecules promote oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, andexcitotoxicity. Importantly, polyamines interact with mutanthuntingtin protein (mHTT) to affect its aggregationand neurotoxicity. This effect may contribute to the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying HD, suggesting that polyamines may act as potential biomarkers of disease progression. Additionally, we discuss the therapeutic implications of targeting the polyamine signaling pathway to alleviate HD symptoms. By enhancing autophagy and modulating neurotransmitter systems, polyamines mayprovideneuroprotectionagainstmHTT-inducedtoxicity. Moreover, the present review provides new insight into the role of polyamines in the pathogenesis of HDand suggests that regulation of polyamine metabolism may represent a promising therapy to slow the disease progression.

Understanding their specific impact on daily activities is crucial for preserving autonomy. However, because cognitive tasks in HD rely on motor functions, and motor tasks demand cognitive processing, disentangling their specific impact remains a challenge. To identify the specific contribution of cognitive and motor impairments on global functional capacity, basic and instrumental activities of daily living (ADL/IADL), and work-related activities (WRA) in HD. 158 HD mutation carriers, enrolled in the BioHD (NCT01412125) and RepairHD (NCT03119246) studies, were evaluated with the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale and the SelfCog. The SelfCog assesses motor processing separately from memory, language, executive functions and visuospatial processing. Linear regressions were fitted to assess how functional capacity declined with motor and cognition impairments. Odds of dependence in ADLs, IADLs and WRAs were estimated using logistic regressions. Cognitive and motor performance were independently associated with functional capacities, though motor performance showed a stronger association than cognitive performance. Decline of all SelfCog cognitive domains contributed to functional decline, with stronger association with global and executive scores compared to language, visuospatial, and memory domains. Higher global and executive deficits were associated with an increased risk of dependence in ADLs, IADLs, and WRAs. The independent contributions of motor, followed by cognitive-mainly executive-functions to functional decline suggest targeted interventions to preserve autonomy and quality of life in HD."

This study aimed to comprehensively assess the safety profile of deutetrabenazine in real-world settings by analyzing AEs reported from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database. We conducted a retrospective pharmacovigilance study using FAERS data from Q3 2017 to Q3 2024, focusing on deutetrabenazine-related AEs. We applied four disproportionality analysis methods-Reporting Odds Ratio (ROR), Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR), Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN) and Multinomial Gamma Poisson Shrinkage (MGPS)--to identify potential safety signals. Furthermore, we utilized the Weibull distribution model to analyze the temporal risk of AEs. Among the 10,571,578 reports obtained from the FAERS database, 4,337 AE reports were associated with deutetrabenazine. Using four independent computational methods at the preferred term (PT) level, we identified 1,131 PTs that indicated noteworthy adverse reactions. The drug's label-listed adverse reactions, including depression, somnolence, suicidal ideation, and fatigue, showed remarkable signals. Furthermore, we detected potential adverse reactions that were not specified on the label, such as drug ineffectiveness, dyskinesia, death, falls, and insomnia. The majority of these AEs were reported within the initial month of deutetrabenazine treatment, with a median time to onset of 40.5 days. This research has yielded initial safety insights into the practical use of deutetrabenazine, validating established adverse reactions and uncovering further possible risks.

The depletion of wild-type (WT) htt (fewer than 36Qs) is also recognized as a contributing factor to HD progression; however, many questions remain about the interactions of biorelevant metals with WT htt and the impact of the interactions on protein aggregation. In the present work, we utilize a combination of biochemical assays and spectroscopic techniques to provide insights into the interaction of copper with an <i>in vitro</i> htt model (N171-17Q). Herein, we use sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and dynamic light scattering to show that the addition of equimolar or higher concentrations of Cu(II) to htt induces time- and temperature-dependent protein oligomerization/aggregation.

    "abstract": "Differentiation from neural progenitor to mature neuron requires a metabolic switch, whereby mature neurons become almost entirely dependent upon oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) for ATP production. Although more efficient with respect to ATP production, OXPHOS produces additional reactive oxygen species, as compared to glycolysis; thus, endogenous mechanisms to quench free radicals are essential for the maintenance of neuronal health. Melatonin is synthesized in neuronal mitochondria and has a dual role as a free radical scavenger and as an inhibitor of mitochondrial-triggered cell death and proinflammatory pathways. Previously, we showed that loss of endogenous melatonin induced mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and cytochrome c (CytC) release triggering pathological inflammation and cell death pathways, respectively. Here we find that in mature neurons, but not undifferentiated neuronal cells, melatonin deficiency altered metabolic reprogramming in aralkylamine N-acetyltransferase knockout (AANAT-KO) neurons as compared with neurons expressing AANAT. Interestingly, there are no differences in neural progenitors regardless of AANAT status. In addition, AANAT-KO deficiency elevated BAK and BAX levels in AANAT-KO neurons. Further, we found that exogenous melatonin treatment of AANAT-KO cells during differentiation into mature neurons rescued metabolic reprogramming defects and restored normal BAK/BAX levels. Thus, we demonstrated that the metabolic reprogramming and subsequent consequences of the switch to OXPHOS that normally occurs during neuronal maturation are compromised by melatonin deficiency and rescued by melatonin supplementation."

These compounds possess diverse neuroprotective capabilities, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-amyloid properties, which contribute to mitigating the progression of neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Parkinson's Disease (PD), Dementia, Multiple Sclerosis (MS), Stroke, and Huntington's Disease (HD). Polyphenols have been extensively studied for their ability to regulate inflammatory responses by modulating the activity of pro-inflammatory genes and influencing signal transduction pathways, thereby reducing neuroinflammation and neuronal death. Additionally, polyphenols have shown promise in modulating various cellular signaling pathways associated with neuronal viability, synaptic plasticity, and cognitive function. Epidemiological and clinical studies highlight the potential of polyphenol-rich diets to decrease the risk and alleviate symptoms of neurodegenerative disorders and neuroinflammation. Furthermore, polyphenols have demonstrated their therapeutic potential through the regulation of key signaling pathways such as Akt, Nrf2, STAT, and MAPK, which play critical roles in neuroprotection and the body's immune response. This review emphasizes the growing body of evidence supporting the therapeutic potential of polyphenols in combating neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation, as well as enhancing brain health. Despite the substantial evidence and promising hypotheses, further research and clinical investigations are necessary to fully understand the role of polyphenols and establish them as advanced therapeutic targets for age-related neurodegenerative diseases and neuroinflammatory conditions."

Aberrations in GSL metabolism drive key pathological features such as protein aggregation, neuroinflammation, and impaired signaling. Specific GSLs, such as GM1, GD3, and GM3, influence amyloid-beta aggregation in AD, α-synuclein stability in PD, and mutant huntingtin toxicity in HD. Therapeutic strategies targeting GSL metabolism, such as GM1 supplementation and enzyme modulation, have demonstrated potential to mitigate disease progression. Further studies using advanced lipidomics and glycomics may support biomarker identification and therapeutic advancements. This work aims to highlight the translational potential of GSL research for diagnosing and managing devastating neurodegenerative conditions."

    "abstract": "Huntington's disease (HD) is considered a rare and fatal neurodegenerative disease; despite that, only one study has described the outcomes among individuals with HD and COVID-19. In this context, an epidemiological investigation was conducted in Brazil using data from Open-Data-SUS (<ext-link ext-link-type=\"uri\" xlink:href=\"https://opendatasus.saude.gov.br/\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">https://opendatasus.saude.gov.br/</ext-link>), a Brazilian open dataset encompassing demographic and clinical information of hospitalized patients. The study comprised 2,180,403 hospitalized patients due to COVID-19 in Brazil from December 29, 2019, to April 6, 2023. From the total original database, patients with HD and three control groups were selected (control 1 [CG-1] - hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and a neurological disorder [except those with HD], control 2 [CG-2] - hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and no comorbidities, and control 3 [CG-3] - hospitalized patients with COVID-19 except for those with HD). The study described the following characteristics of these patients: sex, age, race, place of residence, presence of nosocomial infection, clinical signs, comorbidities, use of antiviral medication for the flu, need for intensive care unit, need for mechanical ventilation support, discharge criteria, and outcome. A total of 60 patients with HD were enrolled, representing a prevalence of 2.8 per 100,000 inhabitants. Of these, 23 were men, 30 were aged between 25 and 60 years, 38 were White, 58 lived in urban areas, and two had a nosocomial infection. The main clinical signs presented were fever (N = 45), dyspnea (N = 45), peripheral oxygen saturation <95% (N = 45), cough (N = 38), and respiratory discomfort (N = 37). The main comorbidities were cardiopathy (N = 13), asthma (N = 2), and chronic lung disease (N = 2). Four patients received antiviral medication for the flu. During hospitalization, 18 patients required admission to an intensive care unit, 10 used invasive mechanical ventilation, 42 used noninvasive mechanical ventilation, and eight did not use ventilatory support. Regarding outcomes, 36 patients were cured, 23 died due to COVID-19, and 1 died from a cause not associated with COVID-19. In the comparison of markers between patients with HD and the controls, the following significant associations were described: (CG-1) patients with HD were younger and presented fewer clinical signs and comorbidities; (CG-2) patients with HD were commonly female, older, presented fewer clinical signs, and had a higher chance of death (OR = 2.354 [95% CI = 1.395-3.973]); and (CG-3) patients with HD were more commonly female and presented fewer clinical signs and comorbidities. Patients with HD can be considered an at-risk population due to the poor clinical outcomes compared to patients without comorbidities. Even then, this group of patients presented fewer clinical signs and comorbidities."

    "abstract": "In this \"centenary\" paper, an expert panel revisited Hans Berger's groundbreaking discovery of human restingstate electroencephalographic (rsEEG) alpha rhythms (8-12 Hz) in 1924, his foresight of substantial clinical applications in patients with \"senile dementia,\" and new developments in the field, focusing on Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most prevalent cause of dementia in pathological aging. Clinical guidelines issued in 2024 by the US National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association (NIA-AA) and the European Neuroscience Societies did not endorse routine use of rsEEG biomarkers in the clinical workup of older adults with cognitive impairment. Nevertheless, the expert panel highlighted decades of research from independent workgroups and different techniques showing consistent evidence that abnormalities in rsEEG delta, theta, and alpha rhythms (< 30 Hz) observed in AD patients correlate with wellestablished AD biomarkers of neuropathology, neurodegeneration, and cognitive decline. We posit that these abnormalities may reflect alterations in oscillatory synchronization within subcortical and cortical circuits, inducing cortical inhibitory-excitatory imbalance (in some cases leading to epileptiform activity) and vigilance dysfunctions (e.g., mental fatigue and drowsiness), which may impact AD patients' quality of life. Berger's vision of using EEG to understand and manage dementia in pathological aging is still actual."

    "abstract": "Huntington's disease (HD) is a hereditary neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive, neuropsychiatric and motor symptoms caused by a CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the huntingtin gene. Imaging techniques are crucial for understanding HD pathophysiology and monitoring disease progression. This review is targeted at general neurologists and movement disorders specialists with an interest in HD and aims to bring complex imaging, including new experimental techniques, closer to the practicing clinician. We provide a summary of findings from conventional structural, diffusion and functional imaging in HD studies, together with an update on emerging novel techniques, including multiparametric mapping, multi-shell diffusion techniques, ultra-high field 7-Tesla MRI, positron emission tomography and magnetoencephalography. Conventional imaging techniques have deepened our understanding of neuropathological progression in HD, from striatal atrophy to widespread cortical and white matter changes. The integration of novel imaging techniques reviewed has further improved our ability to interrogate, quantify and visualize disease-specific alterations with high precision. Novel imaging techniques have promising roles to further our understanding of HD pathology and as imaging markers for clinical trials, disease staging and therapeutic monitoring. Additionally, the synergistic potential of combining imaging modalities with molecular and genetic data, along with wet biomarkers and clinical data, will help provide a complete and comprehensive view of HD pathology and progression."

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's disease, represent a significant global health challenge with limited therapeutic options. Protein misfolding and aggregation, a common pathological hallmark in these disorders, have emerged as promising targets for therapeutic intervention. Molecular docking techniques have played a pivotal role in the identification and design of small molecules that can modulate protein misfolding, offering new hope for effective treatments. This review provides an overview of recent advancements in molecular docking techniques for targeting protein misfolding in neurodegenerative diseases. We discuss the principles and methodologies behind molecular docking, including various scoring functions and algorithms employed for accurate ligand-protein interactions. Additionally, we explore the use of molecular dynamics simulations and machine learning approaches to enhance the precision of docking studies. Furthermore, we highlight case studies and success stories where molecular docking has contributed to the discovery of potential drug candidates for neurodegenerative diseases. These include compounds that inhibit amyloid-β aggregation in Alzheimer's disease, α-synuclein oligomerisation in Parkinson's disease, and mutant huntingtin aggregation in Huntington's disease. We also discuss the problems and restrictions of molecular docking related to neurodegenerative diseases, such as how to accurately show the flexibility of proteins and why docking results need to be confirmed by experiments. We also discuss the structural biology methods, such as cryo-electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography, and how these techniques might help in improving molecular docking studies."

    "abstract": "Huntington's disease (HD) is a devastating movement disorder without a current cure. Although the monogenic basis of HD is well-defined, the complex downstream effects that underlie behavioral symptoms are poorly understood. These effects include cortical dysfunctions, yet the role of specific cortical neuronal subtypes in HD symptoms remain largely unexplored. Here, we used longitudinal <i>in vivo</i> two-photon calcium imaging to examine the activity of two cortical inhibitory neuron (IN) subtypes and excitatory corticostriatal projection neurons (CSPNs) in the motor cortex of R6/2 HD mouse model throughout disease progression. We found that motor deficits in R6/2 mice were accompanied by neuron type-specific abnormalities in movement-related activity, including hypoactivity of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-INs and CSPNs. Optogenetic activation of VIP-INs in R6/2 mice restored healthy levels of activity in VIP-INs and their downstream CSPNs and ameliorated motor deficits in R6/2 mice. Our findings highlight cortical INs as a potential therapeutic target for HD and possibly other neurological diseases."

To evaluate NfL's utility in HDL2, a comparative analysis among HDL2 (n = 12), HD (n = 9), and unaffected controls (n = 9) was conducted. Employing a cross-sectional design, NfL levels were assessed in blood plasma. Concentrations were notably elevated in both HD and HDL2 groups compared to controls. HD patients displayed higher NfL levels than HDL2, possibly reflecting disease duration differences. NfL effectively distinguished HDL2 from controls, highlighting its promise as a possible biomarker in HDL2 research."

    "abstract": "Huntington's disease (HD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder marked by motor, cognitive, and behavioral impairments. Antidopaminergic medications (ADMs), such as VMAT2 inhibitors and antipsychotics, are commonly used to manage HD motor disturbances and behavioral disorders. For patients and caregivers, ADMs are an important tool for managing symptoms that negatively affect daily life. However, the impact of ADM use in HD is not firmly understood due to a lack of robust, systematic studies that assessed their overall effect on HD disease. A mounting body of evidence suggests these medications may be associated with worse clinical measures of cognitive function and functional impairment. While regulatory guidelines highlight adverse effects like sedation, cognitive dysfunction, and extrapyramidal symptoms, it is unclear whether ADMs directly impact disease progression or if the side effects mimic or exacerbate measures of HD symptoms in clinical trials. Given ADM effects on the central nervous system and biological uncertainty within HD outcomes, clinical trial designs should recognize the impact of ADMs on key outcomes, as measured by acceptable scales including Total Functional Capacity, Stoop Word Reading, Symbol Digit Modality Test, and the composite Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale. The development of novel HD interventions requires consideration of concomitant ADM use that may influence measures of disease presentation. In this review, we highlight the role of ADMs in HD management, their symptomatic benefits and potential risks, especially with high dose associated side effects, interactions with CYP2D6 inhibitors, and the individualized need for careful dose monitoring for clinical care and trial design."

In this narrative review and case report, we first review the extant literature on applications of ACT to patients with a variety of mental and physical health challenges, including neurodegenerative disorders, and their caregivers. We then discuss applications of ACT to Huntington's disease (HD). We provide a case report of a 52-year-old man living with HD who, accompanied by his caregiver, received a virtually-delivered 6-session ACT intervention. We measured the patient's self-reported symptoms of depression (PHQ-9) and anxiety (GAD-7) as well as his health-related quality of life (HDQoL) and level of cognitive fusion (i.e., being attached to his thoughts; CFQ-13) at baseline and following the intervention. At follow-up, the patient had a clinically significant reduction in depressive symptoms (from moderate to mild symptomatology) and cognitive fusion. Further, the patient had improvements in quality of life across the domains of physical functioning, mood, and worries. The promising outcomes of this case, as well as extant literature on the effectiveness of ACT in supporting individuals with similar neurodegenerative disorders, suggests that ACT may hold promise as a scalable and impactful intervention for individuals living with HD and their caregivers. We conclude with a call for further study of ACT with this population to build a more robust evidence base that can be used to benefit individuals living with HD and their caregivers."

However, this impact and children's needs are often misunderstood, even by professional services. Even when resources are available, children often feel that their needs are unmet, raising concerns about the adequacy of available guidance and support.ObjectiveThis study aims to offer an in-depth understanding of the multifaceted impact of growing up with a parent with HD, examining the needs for professional guidance on emotional and social aspects, and identifying specific areas where support can be improved to better aid them.MethodsThis retrospective study utilized an exploratory sequential mixed methods design, combining qualitative focus groups (<i>n </i>= 13) and a quantitative survey (<i>n </i>= 23). Qualitative data were analyzed using an inductive thematic analysis with a descriptive phenomenological approach. Quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics.ResultsThe impact of HD on children extends across various domains, affecting self-development, social interactions, and family dynamics. Support received at home varied, with limited access to professional help. Support needs primarily revolved around emotional support and access to comprehensive information. Key support providers, such as parents, peers, mentors, healthcare providers and coaches with expertise in HD, play crucial roles in addressing these needs.ConclusionsThe study underscores challenges faced by children in HD families. By centering our efforts on the emotional well-being of these children, offering tailored information, involving their social network, providing community-based support, and strengthening parental support systems, we can improve the support required by children in these families."

We performed a comparative characterization of the neuropathology between zQ175 and Q175DN mice in the striatum and the hippocampus by assessing HTT aggregation, neuronal and glial pathology, chaperone expression, and synaptic density.ResultsWe showed that Q175DN mice presented enhanced mHTT aggregation in both striatum and hippocampus compared to zQ175. Striatal neurons showed a greater susceptibility to enhanced accumulation of mHTT in Q175DN. On the contrary, no signs of hippocampal pathology were found in zQ175 and absence of hippocampal pathology persisted in Q175DN mice despite higher levels of mHTT. In addition, Q175DN hippocampus presented increased synaptic density, decreased Iba1<sup>+</sup> microglia density and enhanced HSF1 levels in specific subregions of the hippocampus compared to zQ175.ConclusionsQ175DN mice are a valuable tool to understand the fundamental susceptibility differences to mHTT toxicity between striatal neurons and other neuronal subtypes.

Depression was analyzed based on HD functional stages and diagnostic tools, alongside reviewing its association with various HD factors.ResultsWe assessed 6523 records and included 104 studies. Our meta-analyses revealed that the overall frequency of depression was higher in manifest HD compared to premanifest HD (0.38 vs. 0.23). However, the progression of depression did not follow a consistent pattern, with peaks occurring in earlier rather than later stages. Additionally, the frequency of depression was lower in studies using diagnostic criteria compared to those using clinical scales (0.25 vs. 0.42).ConclusionsOur findings showed that the rate of depression is high in HD and varies depending on the disease stage and the criteria used.

HD is characterized by a progressive decline in motor functions. This decline includes involuntary movements (chorea) and the worsening of controlled motions caused mainly by neuronal dysfunction in the striatum. In addition to the deterioration of motor symptoms, HD patients also suffer from cognitive changes, mood swings, apathy, depression, outbursts of anger, psychosis, and social withdrawal. A comprehensive examination of cognitive, affective, and social changes in the HD mouse model is required for the development of combined therapy for both motor and non-motor deficits in HD. The behavioral tests for anxiety, memory, and social traits were used in this study. YAC128 HD transgenic mice exhibited anxiolytic behavior in the novel brightly illuminated environment of the open field and light-dark place preference tests. Moreover, YAC128 HD mice also suffered from a decline in their recognition memory during the novel object recognition test. YAC128 HD mice demonstrated reduced exploration interest during the open field with a non-social target as well as during the first day of the three-chamber social test. Social interaction was also impaired in YAC128 HD mice as it was shown in the social interaction with resident intruder test. YAC128 HD mouse model may be used as a model system to test the possible treatments for both motor and non-motor symptoms including memory loss, agitation and social withdrawal."

Its prevalence varies by ethnicity and region. This study aims to analyze mortality trends and disparities in adults with HD in the United States (US). This study analyzed death certificates from 1999 to 2020 for deaths due to HD (ICD-10 code G10) in individuals aged 25 and older. Age-adjusted mortality rates (AAMRs) and annual percent change (APC) were calculated by year, gender, age groups, race/ethnicity, geographics and urbanization status. Between 1999 and 2020, there were 24,121 reported deaths among patients with HD. During this period, the AAMR increased from 4.3 to 6.0 per 1,000,000 population, with a notable surge from 2018 to 2020 (APC: 9.88; 95% CI: 5.45 to 13.20). Older adults exhibited the highest AAMRs at 10.4 per 1,000,000 when analyzed by age-group. Men and women had comparable AAMRs (5.2 vs. 5.0).

Currently available patient-reported outcome measures may not adequately capture the impact of HD-related cognitive impairment on daily life, particularly higher-order executive functioning (i.e., processing information, decision making, multi-tasking, planning, etc.). To address the unmet need to better quantify the functional sequelae of HD-related cognitive impairment by developing the Huntington's Disease Everyday Functioning (Hi-DEF) scale. Qualitative interviews were conducted in two adult cohorts (25-65 years) with early stages of HD (i.e., huntingtin [<i>mHTT</i>] gene carriers with self-reported cognitive complaints but could still function independently). Cohort 1 included 10 dyads of participants with HD and their care partners, who completed concept elicitation interviews to identify cognitive challenges impacting everyday tasks, which was used to design a draft item-set. Cohort 2, which included 15 additional participants with HD, cognitively debriefed this item-set. In Cohort 1, issues with executive functioning were reported 32 times by participants with HD and 22 times by care partners, and challenges with functioning were reported 46 times by participants with HD and 20 times by care partners. Based on these reports, the Hi-DEF scale was developed and cognitive debriefing interviews evaluated its content validity, relevance, clarity, interpretation, and acceptability. Psychometric validation of the Hi-DEF scale is reported elsewhere. These interviews revealed the impact of HD-related cognitive impairment on everyday functioning and supported the content validity, relevance, clarity, interpretation, and acceptability of the Hi-DEF scale."

It is important to characterize the deficits present and explore the relationships among these symptoms in order to provide high quality clinical care. The purpose of this study was to characterize gait, balance, and physical activity level in individuals with HD and explore the relationships among motor and non-motor symptoms. Individuals completed one lab visit and wore a sensor for seven days to capture physical activity level. During the lab visit, gait, balance, and cognitive status were assessed using validated measures. A 2 × 2 ANOVA (Group×Condition) was used to assess differences in gait between individuals with HD vs. controls, while t-tests were used for other clinical measures. Correlations as well as a mixed effects model explored relationships among clinical measures in the HD group. Individuals with HD walk significantly slower and have significantly worse balance than controls. Gait velocity and balance were significantly correlated with cognitive status in individuals with HD. Additionally, balance performance and balance confidence were not significantly correlated, indicating that there may be a lack of self-awareness of deficits present in individuals with HD. In-lab measures were not significant predictors of physical activity. Motor impairments in individuals with HD are correlated with cognitive impairment. Clinicians should be aware of the impact of cognitive impairment when selecting interventions to address motor symptoms in individuals with HD."

Recent observations suggest that disturbances in social cognition may feature prominently in HD, potentially contributing to behavioral challenges. This study aims to explore the onset and neural mechanisms underlying social cognition disturbances in HD, which are not yet well understood despite increasing recognition of these symptoms. This study compared 20 individuals in the early stages of HD with 20 healthy controls across a range of cognitive tests, in-depth social cognition assessments, and structural MRI evaluations. The findings revealed alterations in various aspects of social cognition, particularly cognitive and affective Theory of Mind, in the early HD group. Some of these alterations correlated with the neurodegeneration of the striatum (caudate), suggesting that social cognition deficits may serve as early indicators of disease progression. This research underscores the importance of integrating social cognition evaluations into the clinical assessment of HD and hints at a complex interplay between these deficits and the broader neuropsychological impact of the disease. The results thus advocate for a more holistic approach to understanding and managing HD, considering the potential interdependencies between social cognition and other cognitive functions."

    "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> Disrupted 24-h sleep-wake and rest-activity cycles are known common features in Huntington's disease (HD) patients; however, critical periods during the 24-h cycle have been less studied. <b>Objective:</b> To analyze the differences between early-mid stage HD patients and healthy controls (HC) in sleep patterns and 24-h motor activity by using actigraphic monitoring. <b>Methods:</b> Twenty HD patients (13 females; mean age ± SD 56.45 ± 16.94) at early-mid stage of the disease and 20 HC were actigraphically monitored for a week. We applied the Functional Linear Modeling (FLM) to analyze motor activity from the actigraphic data. We analyzed parameters regarding both the time spent in bed and out of bed; get-up time (GUT); time in bed (TIB); midpoint of sleep (MS); sleep motor activity (SMA); sleep onset latency (SOL); total sleep time (TST); wake after sleep onset (WASO); sleep efficiency (SE); number and duration of awakenings (AWK); diurnal motor activity (DMA) and diurnal total sleep time (DTST). <b>Results:</b> Ten patients were in Stage I, 6 in Stage II and 4 in Stage III. HD patients presented lower SE and higher TIB, SOL, WASO, AWK and AWK > 5 min in comparison to HC. Moreover, higher motor activity was observed in patients with HD, in particular between 2:15 and 4:00 am, from around 40 min prior to bedtime until 20 min after bedtime, and from around 20 min prior to get-up time until 50 min after get-up time. <b>Conclusions:</b> Actigraphy documented a specific 24-h motor pattern in HD, potentially constituting a disease signature."

    "title": "Huntington's disease at work: The effect of profession-specific requirements as related to clinical characteristics on work outcome.",
    "abstract": "In most Huntington's disease expanded gene carriers (HDEGC), losing work capacity is the first sign of functional decline. Cognitive deterioration, motor dysfunction, and psychiatric disturbances are associated with or predict work outcomes in HD. The role of profession-specific requirements, however, has not been investigated. This study examines the relationship between work outcomes, clinical characteristics, burnout, and profession-specific requirements in HDEGC. We hypothesize that burnout-like symptoms are associated with mild apathy and that profession-specific requirements influence clinical characteristics affecting work capacity in HD. A cohort of 117 HDEGC (CAG repeat ≥36) participated in the \"HD-work\" study at Leiden University Medical Center. Participants were 18-67 years old, either, worked at baseline, or had lost their job within two years. The Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale assessed motor abilities, global functioning, and cognition. The HD-work questionnaire and the 'Utrecht Burn Out Scale' assessed work problems and burnout. Statistical methods included descriptive statistics, Pearson correlations, Cronbachs alpha, t-tests, and logistic regressions. Burnout-like symptoms did not differ between those with full and reduced working capacity and were not more prevalent in HD than in the general Dutch population. No significant effect was found between work outcomes and profession-specific requirements, even when adjusted for clinical characteristics. Our study suggests that profession-specific requirements do not significantly impact work ability among individuals with HD in early phases of HD. Workplace adjustments should be tailored to individual preferences rather than profession-specific demands. Burnout-like symptoms did not affect work capacity or relate to apathy."

    "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> Huntington's disease (HD) is among the most complex long-term neurological conditions, necessitating care and management from multiple partners within and beyond the health sector. However, there is a paucity of evidence describing how individuals receive this multifaceted care and whether current care provision adequately meets their needs. <b>Objective:</b> To understand if current care provision is meeting the complex needs of people living with HD in England and assess their perceived need for integrated care. <b>Methods:</b> A cross-sectional survey was co-designed with patient and public representatives, as part of a mixed-methods study to explore what integrated care means for people living with HD. The survey was distributed online and via charities, collecting quantitative and qualitative data. Descriptive statistics and content analysis were performed. <b>Results:</b> A total of 153 people, from 45 counties in England, participated in the survey. When assessing person-centered coordinated care, 65% of respondents rated their care as very poor, poor, or expressed a neutral opinion; carers reported the lowest scores. Although 58% of the participants said it was extremely important to have a care coordinator, only 19% of people reported having one, with these coordinators being identified in only 40% of the counties. Nevertheless, people with access to a care coordinator reported markedly improved care experiences. <b>Conclusions:</b> People living with HD commonly report fragmented care, geographical inequalities in care access, and unmet complex needs. Future research should focus on developing an HD integrated care model tailored to address these complex needs, including an evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of an HD care coordinator."

    "abstract": "Huntington's disease (HD) is a devastating disease due to autosomal dominant mutation in the HTT gene. Its pathophysiology involves multiple molecular alterations including transcriptional defects. We previously showed that in HD patients and mouse model, the protein levels of the non-receptor tyrosine kinase PYK2 were decreased in the hippocampus and that viral expression of PYK2 improved the hippocampal phenotype. Here, we investigated the possible contribution of PYK2 in the striatum, a brain region particularly altered in HD. PYK2 mRNA levels were decreased in the striatum and hippocampus of R6/2 mice, a severe HD model. Striatal PYK2 protein levels were also decreased in R6/2 mice and human patients. PYK2 knockout by itself did not result in motor symptoms observed in HD mouse models. We examined whether PYK2 deficiency participated in the R6/2 mice phenotype by expressing PYK2 in their dorsal striatum using AAV vectors. With an AAV1/Camk2a promoter, we did not observe significant improvement of body weight, clasping, motor activity and coordination (rotarod) alterations observed in R6/2 mice. With an AAV9/SYN1 promoter we found a slightly higher body weight and a trend to better rotarod performance. Both viruses similarly transduced striatal projection neurons and somatostatin-positive interneurons but only AAV9/SYN1 led to PYK2 expression in cholinergic and parvalbumin-positive interneurons. Expression of PYK2 in cholinergic interneurons may contribute to the slight effects observed. We conclude that PYK2 mRNA and protein levels are decreased in the striatum as in hippocampus of HD patients and mouse models. However, in contrast to hippocampus, striatal viral expression of PYK2 has only a minor effect on the R6/2 model striatal phenotype."

    "abstract": "The utility of polymer-permanent, polymer-absorbable, and polymer-free drug-eluting stents (DES) in the context of different eluting drugs in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) remains controversial. The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of different DES strategies in post-PCI patients. Digital databases were searched to select all randomized control trials. Different combinations of DES were directly compared with permanent-polymer sirolimus-eluting stents. The primary outcome was major adverse cardiovascular events; a composite of cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction (MI), and target vessel revascularization. A network meta-analysis was performed to determine the net relative risk (RR) and its 95% CI. A total of 314 randomized control trials comprising 345,749 patients with coronary artery disease undergoing PCI were included. Compared with polymer-permanent sirolimus-eluting stent, polymer-free titanium-nitride-oxide (RR: 0.68; 95% CI: 0.53-0.87), polymer-permanent everolimus (RR: 0.89; 95% CI: 0.82-0.96), and zotarolimus stents (RR: 0.89; 95% CI: 0.79-0.99) had a lower risk of major adverse cardiovascular events at 5 years. Polymer-free titanium-nitride-oxide stents also had a significantly lower incidence of stent thrombosis (RR: 0.28; 95% CI: 0.13-0.59) and MI (RR: 0.41; 95% CI: 0.27-0.62) at 1 year. Bare metal stents had a significantly higher 1-year risk of MI (RR: 1.52; 95% CI: 1.25-1.86), and need for target vessel revascularization (RR: 2.26; 95% CI: 1.93-2.64). In comparison with polymer-permanent sirolimus, the newer stents including polymer-free titanium-nitride-oxide, polymer-permanent everolimus, and zotarolimus stents significantly reduce the risk of long-term ischemic events."

    "abstract": "Healthcare delay (HCDe) is an important but not well-known issue in genetic disorders, especially in tandem nucleotide repeat expansion diseases (TNRED). We aimed to investigate it and determine whether predictive genetic testing (PGT) and other factors may impact HCDe. A retrospective review was performed on electronic files of symptomatic and pre-symptomatic consultants (SC and PSC) by the time of their first evaluation, from TNRED families followed from 1998 to 2023. HCDe was the difference between ages at onset of symptoms (AO) and at start of healthcare for these symptoms in SC and PSC. Age, diagnosis, year of diagnosis, sex, AO, residence, schooling, index cases, and previous PGT were analyzed. Of the 1,100 subjects reviewed, 811 and 101 were SC and PSC carriers of Huntington disease, Huntington disease-like 2, spinocerebellar ataxia type 2, 3, 6, 7, or 10, or Friedreich ataxia. Their median (IQR) HCDe was 5 (6) years and did not differ across diseases. Over the years, the number of annual PSC diagnoses became similar to that of SC. Better schooling and recurrent familial cases were associated with shorter HCDe, but the strongest effect on HCDe was related to PGT: in 33 PSC who converted and came to healthcare, HCDe was of 1 year (p < 0.0001, MW). HCDe was large in all TNRED studied. Parameters related to better access to information, especially PGT, improved HCDe. As molecular diagnoses become more frequent in PSC, we expect that HCDe will be reduced in the future."

Despite the lack of definitive medications, current research efforts are actively assessing novel pharmaceutical interventions through phase III and IV clinical trials to mitigate the limited effectiveness of existing therapeutic approaches. The primary objective of these trials is to enhance symptom management and improve the overall quality of life for individuals diagnosed with HD. These trials show potential for development of further efficacious therapeutic interventions in future. To identify and provide details about medications tested in completed phase III and IV clinical trials for managing HD in adults. Publicly available and relevant phase III and IV trials registered at ClinicalTrials.gov analyzed. Usage of the trialed medications for HD reviewed. As of November 10, 2023, there were 242 phase III and IV clinical trials related to HD. Eight clinical trials from these met the inclusion criteria for the current study. The medications used in phase III and IV trials are minocycline, valbenazine, deutetrabenazine, tominersen, pridopidine (phase III), and memantine (phase IV). Evaluating phase III and IV clinical studies on HD highlights the importance of tailored approaches for each patient's unique disease presentation. Current medications aim to manage HD symptoms, potentially improving outcomes and reducing disease progression risks. The growing emphasis on specific approaches reflects a better understanding of HD's diverse symptoms, presenting opportunities for more effective and personalized treatment strategies."

    "abstract": "Huntington's disease (HD) is a rare neurodegenerative condition characterised by progressive symptoms affecting motricity, cognition, neuropsychiatric function and behaviour. HD develops during a period of life in which many live in partnership and have children. HD impacts all family members through its cognitive and psychological symptoms, mid-life onset, long disease trajectory and genetic risk. The aim of the study was to explore how parents without HD experience and manage parenthood when their partner is affected by HD. Qualitative interviews with 14 caregivers were analysed using reflexive thematic analysis. Three main themes with corresponding subthemes were identified, followed by an underlying theme: <i>Genetic risk: An underlying layer of complexity.</i> The first theme, <i>Balancing competing demands,</i> describes the challenges involved when attempting to attend to conflicting needs within the family<i>.</i> Theme 2, <i>Needing a shoulder to lean on</i>, covers participants' feelings of loneliness and their need to be seen by others, whereas Theme 3, <i>Restoring and building strength</i>, encompasses coping strategies used by caregivers to protect themselves and their children from potential negative experiences. The underlying theme describes how the genetic aspect of the disease permeates the participants' experiences across all other themes. Support providers may be unaware of the extensive repercussions HD can have on a family. Acknowledging the central role of partners without HD and their risk of psychological distress is crucial. Exhausted partners may struggle to support their children, which may lead to childhoods overshadowed by HD. For family members to prioritise their own needs, tailored support must be set in place for parents with HD."

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) and Long COVID represent critical and growing global health challenges, characterized by complex pathophysiological mechanisms including neuronal deterioration, protein misfolding, and persistent neuroinflammation. The emergence of innovative therapeutic approaches, such as whole-body hyperthermia (WBH), offers promising potential to modulate underlying pathophysiological mechanisms in NDs and related conditions like Long COVID. WBH, particularly in fever-range, enhances mitochondrial function, induces heat shock proteins (HSPs), and modulates neuroinflammation-benefits that pharmacological treatments often struggle to replicate. HSPs such as HSP70 and HSP90 play pivotal roles in protein folding, aggregation prevention, and cellular protection, directly targeting pathological processes seen in NDs like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's disease. Preliminary findings also suggest WBH's potential to alleviate neurological symptoms in Long COVID, where persistent neuroinflammation and serotonin dysregulation are prominent. Despite the absence of robust clinical trials, the therapeutic implications of WBH extend to immune modulation and the restoration of disrupted physiological pathways. However, the dual nature of hyperthermia's effects-balancing pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses-emphasizes the need for dose-controlled applications and stringent patient monitoring to minimize risks in vulnerable populations. While WBH shows potential interest, significant challenges remain. These include individual variability in response, limited accessibility to advanced hyperthermia technologies, and the need for standardized clinical protocols. Future research must focus on targeted clinical trials, biomarker identification, and personalized treatment strategies to optimize WBH's efficacy in NDs and Long COVID. The integration of WBH into therapeutic paradigms could mark a transformative step in addressing these complex conditions."

Thus, understanding the relationship between iron and these diseases can pave the way for the development of novel therapeutic strategies. Here, we summarize the latest evidence supporting the pathological roles of dysregulated iron metabolism and ferroptosis in a wide range of preclinical animal models of these currently incurable non-communicable diseases. We also summarize the feasibility of targeting iron metabolism and ferroptosis for the prevention and treatment of iron- and ferroptosis-related diseases that currently have limited treatment options. In addition, we provide our perspectives on the challenges and promises regarding the translational potential of targeting dysregulated iron metabolism and ferroptosis to treat diseases, highlighting the future roadmap for developing iron- and ferroptosis-targeted therapeutics."

    "abstract": "Human MutT homolog 1 (MTH1) plays a crucial role in sanitizing oxidized DNA precursors by enzymatically hydrolyzing oxidized nucleotides. The absence of MTH1 activity in the cells results in the accumulation of oxidized nucleotides within the nucleus and mitochondria, leading to mutations, abnormal proteins, and neurodegeneration (in the central nervous system). It has garnered interest as a potential target for anticancer treatment through targeted inhibitor molecules but remains largely understudied in other neurological disorders. This review explores the understanding of MTH1 expression in glioma and its potential role in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease concerning disease mechanism and prognosis. Neurodegeneration, activation of glial cells, and mitochondrial dysfunction are common mechanisms involved in the progression of these diseases. This review also tries to identify the unexplored associations and research gaps that can reveal novel applications of the enzyme in epilepsy, in which MTH1 is studied less. The influence of the ROS environment and cell type on MTH1 expression and function is crucial to be studied for elucidating its role in a multitude of CNS pathologies. The involvement of microglial cell-mediated inflammatory responses through ROS production in epileptogenesis in mouse models highlights the interplay between oxidative stress and neuroinflammation in epilepsy. The possible existence of a similar association between MTH1 expression and pathogenesis of the discussed neurological disorders in vivo demands further exploration preclinically and in patient samples."

    "abstract": "Background Despite advances in burn care, morbidity and mortality remain high. There is a large gap in research focusing on resource-limited Appalachian burn victims. Appalachia is unique in many different ways. The region is well known nationally for poor healthcare outcomes, household income below the national average, ranking high in addiction and drug use crisis, and characterized with a high prevalence of comorbidities such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus (DM), coronary artery disease, and obesity. To complicate this devastating imbalance, Cabell Huntington Hospital is the sole burn intensive care unit in the state of West Virginia, with only six beds available. It is crucial to understand the factors that prolong the length of stay (LOS), as LOS is a key indicator for healthcare resource utilization, especially in this resource-limited population. This study aims to identify factors that influence LOS among burn patients in Appalachia, focusing on demographic and clinical variables. Methodology A retrospective analysis was conducted among 748 patients between January 1, 2017, and January 1, 2023. Demographic and clinical variables, including age, gender, COPD, DM, smoking history, inhalational injury, burn source, body mass index (BMI), total burn surface area (TBSA), and total ventilation duration (TVD), were collected. Multiple linear regression was used to identify predictors of LOS. Statistical significance was set at p-values <0.05. Results Significant predictors of prolonged LOS included TVD (β = 1.25, p < 0.001), TBSA (β = 0.60, p < 0.001), inhalational injury (β = 6.02, p < 0.001), and burn source (thermal contact with metal: β = 10.68, p = 0.003). Discharge status (dead) was associated with shorter LOS (β = -17.09, p < 0.001). For every additional day of ventilation, LOS increased by approximately 1.25 days. Each percentage increase in TBSA contributed to a 0.6-day increase in LOS. Patients who died had a hospital stay approximately 17 days shorter than those who survived. The presence of inhalational injury extended the LOS by an average of six days. Age, gender, COPD, DM, BMI, and smoking history were not significantly associated with LOS. Conclusions Newer predictor models should be used to combine TBSA with other demographics, comorbidities, and burn factors, such as inhalation injury and TVD, to provide a more accurate LOS for patients, their loved ones, and caregivers. The rule that for every 1% TBSA burned LOS increases with one day does not hold in our population. These findings provide valuable insights for optimizing burn care in resource-limited settings."

This study utilized data from the UK Biobank. Residential green space and natural environment were assessed by the percentage of land covered by greenness within 300 m and 1000 m buffers. Logistic regression models were used to explore the associations of green space and natural environment with possible sarcopenia and sarcopenia. We explored the mediating role of air pollution mixtures in the above associations. Interactions between green space and air pollution were assessed on the multiplicative and the additive scales. A total of 430790 participants were included in this study, and 23637 (5.5%) possible sarcopenia and 769 (0.2%) sarcopenia cases were identified. Each 10% increment of green space and natural environment coverage was associated with lower risks of possible sarcopenia (odds ratio (OR): 0.968, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.961, 0.976 in green space; OR: 0.968, 95%CI: 0.962, 0.975 in natural environment) and sarcopenia (OR: 0.958, 95%CI: 0.920, 0.999 in green space; OR: 0.961, 95%CI: 0.926, 0.998 in natural environment). Population-attributable fraction analyses revealed that lower green space and natural environment levels could attribute to 8.8% and 8.5% of possible sarcopenia, 17.0% and 15.4% of sarcopenia. The associations of green space and natural environment with possible sarcopenia status could be partially explained by reducing air pollution. We also identified a significant multiplicative interaction between air pollution mixtures and green space on possible sarcopenia. In summary, higher green space and natural environment levels were associated with lower risks of possible sarcopenia and sarcopenia. Both modification and mediation roles of air pollution were found in the association between green space and possible sarcopenia. Therefore, expanding green space and reducing air pollution are crucial strategies for mitigating the risk of sarcopenia and promoting healthy aging."

    "title": "The roles of intrinsically disordered proteins in neurodegeneration.",
    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases such as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease share a common pathological hallmark: the accumulation of misfolded proteins, particularly involving intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) like TDP-43, FUS, Tau, α-synuclein, and Huntingtin. These proteins undergo pathological aggregation, forming toxic inclusions that disrupt cellular function. The dysregulation of proteostasis mechanisms, including the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), ubiquitin-independent proteasome system (UIPS), autophagy, and molecular chaperones, exacerbates these proteinopathies by failing to clear misfolded proteins effectively. Emerging therapeutic strategies aim to restore proteostasis through proteasome activators, autophagy enhancers, and chaperone-based interventions to prevent the toxic accumulation of IDPs. Additionally, understanding liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) and its role in stress granule dynamics offers novel insights into how aberrant phase transitions contribute to neurodegeneration. By targeting the molecular pathways involved in IDP aggregation and proteostasis regulation, and better understanding the specificity of each component, research in this area will pave the way for innovative therapeutic approaches to combat these neurodegenerative diseases. This review discusses the molecular mechanisms underpinning IDP pathology, highlights recent advancements in drug discovery, and explores the potential of targeting proteostasis machinery to develop effective therapies."

Generally, these neurodegenerative disorders have a progressive deterioration in neural function and structure, and deposition of misfolded proteins commonly occurs, such as amyloid-β in AD and α-synuclein in PD. However, there exists a special class of exosomes, which acts like a transmitter and enhances communication between cells. The present review discusses the significant role of exosomes in neurodegenerative diseases, with a focus on Amyotrophic lateral Sclerosis (ALS), AD, PD, and Huntington's disease (HD). In this review, the biogenesis of exosomes is discussed from multivesicular bodies and onwards to their release into the extracellular environment. The present review focuses on recent data concerning the possible use of modified exosomes as ND therapy. Indeed, future work is needed to explain the processes driving exosome biogenesis and cargo selection, while opening new routes by the use of exosome-based therapeutics in neurodegenerative disease diagnosis and treatment."

    "abstract": "Dental calculus accumulation varies across individuals. While various factors contribute to its accumulation, the role of salivary composition remains underexplored. This study aims to compare individuals suffering from rapid rates of dental calculus formation rates with those having slow formation rates in terms of salivary electrochemical properties as well as its proteomic, metaproteomic and elemental composition. A total of 26 patients with a history of dental calculus were recruited. Saliva samples were collected and evaluated for electrochemical properties as well as elemental, proteomic and metaproteomic composition. Patients were provided scaling treatment to remove all calculus. Six months after the dental cleaning patients were re-assessed for the presence of dental calculus. Based on the dental calculus formation rate participants were categorised into slow (57.7%) and rapid calculus formers (42.3%) that were then assessed for differences in salivary composition. Rapid calculus formers exhibited a more neutral zeta-potential and lower concentration of salivary calcium ions than their slow-forming counterparts. Proteomic analysis identified 895 proteins across all samples. Of these, 38 proteins were exclusive to the rapid formation group, while 24 proteins were specific to the slow group. The rapid group demonstrated augmented pathways related to cell binding (e.g., cytoskeletal regulation by Rho GTPase and integrin signalling), inflammatory mediation (e.g., chemokine and cytokine signalling) and neurodegenerative disorders (e.g., 5-Hydroxytryptamine degradation, Huntington's disease and Parkinson's disease) and significant enrichment in peptidase inhibitor activity. In contrast, the slow group demonstrated enrichment mainly in immune response. Metaproteomic analysis for salivary bacteria showed significant predominance of Streptococci in the rapid group and elevated levels of Rothia in the slow group. The saliva of patients with rapid calculus formation rates differs from that of patients with slow rates of calculus formation in terms of electrochemical properties as well as proteomic, metaproteomic and elemental composition."

    "abstract": "GFM1 is a nuclear gene that plays a role in mitochondrial function. In recent decades, various homozygous and compound heterozygous mutations have been identified, leading to significant health issues in patients and often resulting in early death. There is a few experimental research on this gene, particularly regarding its pathogenicity through in silico methods and RNA sequencing and experimental validation in GFM1 knockout cells. This study aims to explore how high-risk pathogenic variants affect protein stability and function using a comprehensive bioinformatics approach. Analyses with Align-GVGD, PolyPhen-2, MupRo, and SIFT indicated that most variants are likely to be highly pathogenic and destabilize the protein structure. The variants were consistently classified as high-risk by Align-GVGD and were deemed \"probably damaging\" or \"possibly damaging\" by PolyPhen-2. MupRo analysis suggested a reduction in protein stability, while SIFT indicated functional impacts for all variants. Further analysis with MetaRNN and structural assessments showed that these variants affect protein size, charge, and hydrophobicity, which may disrupt inter-domain interactions and hinder protein function. Differential gene expression analysis in GFM1 knockout HK2 and 293 T cells revealed significant changes in gene expression, particularly in areas related to translation, mitochondrial function, and cellular responses. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses indicated that the affected genes are linked to neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, and various signaling pathways. GFM1 knockout cells displayed notable pathway changes, including those related to oxidative phosphorylation and neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, Huntington's). Upregulation of mitochondrial electron transport chain components (COX17, NDUFB1, ATP5MC1) suggests a compensatory mechanism in response to impaired mitochondrial function. Disruptions in proteostasis and protein synthesis were highlighted by dysregulated proteasome and ribosomal pathways. Markers of mitophagy, such as increased HSP90 and decreased TOMM20 levels, along with changes in PINK1 protein, emphasize GFM1's involvement in mitophagy. Protein-protein interaction analysis connected GFM1 to key mitophagy proteins (e.g., OPTN, Park2/Parkin). Functional experiments confirmed increased mitophagy, indicating a protective response. These results highlight the negative impact of high-risk pathogenic variants on protein stability and cellular function, shedding light on their potential roles in disease progression. This study offers valuable insights into the pathogenic mechanisms linked to GFM1 mutations, underscoring its critical role in mitochondrial function and cellular balance. The findings highlight the gene's involvement in mitophagy, oxidative phosphorylation, and neurodegenerative pathways, laying the groundwork for future research into therapeutic approaches targeting GFM1-related dysfunctions."

    "title": "Vectors in CRISPR Gene Editing for Neurological Disorders: Challenges and Opportunities.",
    "abstract": "Diseases of the nervous system are recognized as the second leading cause of death worldwide. The global prevalence of neurological diseases, such as Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease has seen a significant rise due to the increasing proportion of the aging population. The discovery of the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) genome editing technique has paved way for universal neurological diseases treatment. However, finding a safe and effective method to deliver CRISPR gene-editing tools remains a main challenge for genome editing therapies in vivo. Adeno-associated virus (AAV) is currently one of the most commonly used vector systems, but some issues remain unresolved, including capsid immunogenicity, off-target mutations, and potential genotoxicity. To address these concerns, researchers are actively encouraging the development of new delivery systems, like virus-like particles and nanoparticles. These novel systems have the potential to enhance targeting efficiency, thereby offering possible solutions to the current challenges. This article reviews CRISPR delivery vectors for neurological disorders treatment and explores potential solutions to overcome limitations in vector systems. Additionally, the delivery strategies of CRISPR systems are highlighted as valuable tools for studying neurological diseases, and the challenges and opportunities that these vectors present."

    "abstract": "Theory of Mind (ToM) is the ability to predict the behaviour of others by inferring their cognitive and affective states. The literature suggests that different neural substrates within the basal ganglia are involved in the affective (ventral striatum) and cognitive (dorsal striatum) components of ToM. We investigated ToM dysfunction in two different basal ganglia pathologies, Huntington's disease (HD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), in their early stages. Indeed, a different progression of neurodegeneration from the dorsal striatum to the ventral striatum is described in the two diseases. We also investigated whether there is a correlation between ToM and executive function. Twenty-one patients with HD, 21 with PD, and 22 healthy subjects (HS) were recruited. All participants completed a ToM assessment using the Yoni task, which assesses both cognitive and affective components at two levels of meta-representational difficulty (i.e. first-order items only require inferring the mental state of a person, while second-order items also require inferring the mental states of a person about others). The clinical groups also underwent a full neuropsychological assessment. In HD patients, both cognitive and affective ToM were equally impaired, whereas in PD patients, impairment of the cognitive component predominated. Specifically, compared to HS, HD patients scored lower on both inferential levels and on both cognitive and affective components, whereas PD patients scored lower than HS only on second-order and cognitive items. In the clinical groups, there was an imbalance between the cognitive and affective components, with higher accuracy on affective items. Performance on the Yoni task did not correlate with tests assessing executive functions. We suggest that the different pattern of ToM alteration in HD and PD may be a result of differential involvement of the ventral and dorsal striatum and that ToM abilities in these clinical populations are not directly supported by executive functioning."

Recent advancements in understanding HD's cellular and molecular pathways have paved the way for identifying various effective small-molecule candidates to treat the disorder. Two small molecules, Tetrabenazine and Deutetrabenazine, are approved for managing chorea associated with HD, and several others are under clinical trials. Notably, the field of small-molecule therapeutics targeting HD is rapidly progressing, and there is anticipation of their approval in the foreseeable future. This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of the emergence of small-molecule therapeutics in various stages of clinical development for HD therapy. The emphasis is placed on detailing their structural design, therapeutic effects, and specific mechanisms of action. Additionally, exploring key drivers implicated in HD pathogenesis offers valuable insights, as a foundational principle for designing prospective anti-HD therapeutic leads."

    "abstract": "Huntington Disease is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease caused by expansion of the polymorphic trinucleotide CAG repeat of the HTT gene to code for an expanded glutamine track of the mutant Huntingtin protein (mHTT). Like other neurodegenerative diseases, symptomatic presentation of Huntington Disease is age-dependent or age-related. This age-dependent manifestation of an autosomal dominant disease trait underscores important and possibly priming role of age-related changes in cellular physiology that are conducive to disease presentation. Herein, we present studies on the effects of osmolytes on mHTT structuring and aggregation, vis-a-vis pathogenicity. We show that stabilizing polyol osmolytes, by their generic activity in promoting protein structuring and compaction, drive aggregation of the disordered mHTT protein and simultaneously inhibit their binding to and sequestration of key transcription factors for improved homeostasis and cell survival under stress. These and related observations in the literature give strong support to the notion that lower molecular weight and structurally dynamic forms of mHTT contribute importantly to disease pathogenesis. Aging is associated with important changes in the cell environment-disease protein accumulation, reduced hydration, and macromolecular crowding as examples. These changes have significant consequences on the structuring and pathogenicity of the disordered mHTT protein. A crowded and less hydrated aging cell environment is conducive to mHTT binding to and inhibition of cell regulatory protein function on the one hand, and in promoting mHTT aggregation on the other hand, to culminate in Huntington disease presentation."

    "abstract": "The 2024-revised McDonald criteria for multiple sclerosis (MS) proposed to incorporate cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-specific oligoclonal bands and kappa free light chains (KFLC) as diagnostic biomarkers. While the 2017-revised criteria highlighted CSF-specific oligoclonal bands to indicate intrathecal IgG synthesis, significantly enhancing early MS diagnosis, KFLC have emerged as additional marker. Now, the question rises of whether both biomarkers serve as competing or complementary tools in MS diagnostics. In this narrative review, we extensively searched the literature on oligoclonal bands and KFLC determination in CSF and serum across neurological disorders, with a focus on MS, using the PubMed database to demonstrate the complementarity of both biomarkers. Oligoclonal bands have long been a reliable marker of intrathecal IgG synthesis in MS, valued for their high diagnostic sensitivity, unique patient \"fingerprints,\" clonality differentiation, semi-quantitative analysis, and pre-analytic robustness. However, they present challenges in standardization, labor-intensity, method variability, examiner dependency, and limited data on non-IgG immunoglobulins. Quantitative KFLC measurement provides rapid, examiner-independent, and cost-effective assessment across all immunoglobulin classes but might have lower specificity, lacked consensus on standardized interpretation in recent years, and is not yet supported by comprehensive prospective multinational studies on its prognostic role. Both oligoclonal bands and KFLC have unique strengths and limitations that complement each other, potentially serving as complementary markers for evaluating intrathecal Ig synthesis in MS diagnosis. Further evidence is needed to establish the value of KFLC in MS diagnosis, thus multicenter prospective studies are being conducted to compare the diagnostic utility of both markers."

    "abstract": "Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by the abnormal expansion of CAG repeats in exon 1 of the HTT gene. Mutant huntingtin (mHTT) associates with mitochondria, resulting in mitochondrial dysfunction and neuronal cell death. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unknown. In this study, we investigate the role of N-terminal first 17 amino acids (N17) of mHTT in regulating its mitochondrial localization. Specifically, we demonstrate that the mutation at leucine 7 of N17 domain suppresses the association of mHTT with mitochondria. Blocking mitochondrial localization of HTT exon 1 with 73 glutamine repeats (HTT-Q73) strongly ameliorates polyglutamine-induced reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential, increase of reactive oxygen species production, and decrease in NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH ratio. We observe that HTT-Q73-mediated abnormal mitochondrial morphology, mitochondrial DNA deletion, and cell death are abolished by HTT-Q73-L7A mutation. Finally, overexpression of HTT-Q73-L7A do not cause neurodegeneration and motor dysfunction in vivo. These findings highlight the pivotal role of the L7 residue which contributes to mHTT-caused HD pathology. Targeting the L7 residue of N17 domain may be a novel therapeutic strategy to alleviate mitochondrial dysfunction and neurodegeneration in HD."

    "abstract": "Huntington disease (HD) is a genetic neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive motor dysfunction, cognitive decline, and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Assessing early motor skill deficits in HD mouse models is challenging with traditional behavioral tasks. This study uses a home cage-based lever-pulling task, PiPaw2.0, to evaluate motor learning in 6-7 months-old zQ175 knock-in HD mice in a more naturalistic environment. In this task, mice learn to pull a lever for a water reward, with the requirement to hold the lever within a specific goal range for a required hold time. As the mice improved, the required hold time increased, thereby gradually increasing the task demands. Both wild type (WT) and zQ175 mice initially showed similar task engagement, but zQ175 mice had significant deficits in adapting to increasing hold time. The WT mice refined their strategies over time, shifting from random to more precise lever pulls, while zQ175 mice failed to make this adjustment, maintaining erratic performance. Additionally, in group-housing WT mouse lever performance benefited from peer interactions, an effect absent in zQ175 mice. Post-task neural assessments revealed that WT mice developed experience-mediated synaptic plasticity in the left striatum (contralateral to lever-pulling paw), while zQ175 mice showed no significant changes, consistent with known corticostriatal plasticity impairments in HD mouse models. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of group-housed, home cage-based assessments for evaluating motor learning and adaptation in HD mouse models. This study provides insights into the motor control and adaptive learning deficits in HD, emphasizing the value of automated home cage systems in advancing neurodegenerative disease research and highlighting the importance of peer influences on performance."

Specifically, the <i>ApoEε4</i> allele is a significant risk factor for SAD, while <i>ApoEε2</i> allele provides protection compared to the more common <i>ApoEε3</i> allele. This review discusses the role of the ApoE in AD and other neurodegenerative disorders. ApoE, a cholesterol transport protein, influences several pathways involved in neurodegeneration, particularly in AD. Beyond its established role in amyloid <i>β</i>-protein (Aβ) metabolism and deposition, ApoE also impacts tau pathology, neurodegeneration, and the microglial response to AD. The review aims to provide an updated overview of ApoE's diverse roles, emphasizing its involvement in Aβ clearance through ApoE receptors. It also covers ApoE's influence in other neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), Huntington's disease (HD), vascular dementia (VD), and multiple sclerosis (MS). New research highlights the interaction between ApoE and presenilin (PS), suggesting connections between familial AD (FAD) and SAD. The review also explores protective effects of ApoE mutations against AD and ApoE4-induced tauopathy, neurodegeneration, and neuroinflammation. The insights from this comprehensive update could indeed lead to new therapeutic strategies for neurodegenerative diseases."

For example, amyloid-beta (Aβ) and tau aggregates are present in the brain and plasma of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD); α-synuclein in Parkinson's disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and multiple system atrophy (MSA); mutant huntingtin protein (Htt) in Huntington's disease (HD); and DNA-binding protein 43 kD (TDP-43) in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE). The same misfolded proteins can be present in multiple diseases in the form of mixed proteinopathies. Since there is no cure for all these diseases, understanding the mechanisms of protein aggregation becomes imperative in modern medicine, especially for developing diagnostics and therapeutics. A Multimer Detection System (MDS) was designed to distinguish and quantify the multimeric/oligomeric forms from the monomeric form of aggregated proteins. As the unique epitope of the monomer is already occupied by capturing or detecting antibodies, the aggregated proteins with multiple epitopes would be accessible to both capturing and detecting antibodies simultaneously, and signals will be generated from the oligomers rather than the monomers. Hence, MDS could present a simple solution for measuring various conformations of aggregated proteins with high sensitivity and specificity, which may help to explore diagnostic and treatment strategies for developing anti-aggregation therapeutics."

Under various disease states, the abundance and diversity of beneficial bacteria are significantly decreased, a process called dysbiosis. Among the intra- and extracellular components of probiotics, the extracellular vesicles (EVs) secreted by them have recently garnered significant attention as potential mediators of probiotics' effects on host health. Further, these nanosized particles that encapsulate a wide range of bioactive molecules (proteins, lipids, RNA, and DNA) are standing out as key factors that could mediate gut microbiota-host communication and confer ameliorating effects in experimental inflammatory, metabolic, and cardiovascular disease models. However, a standard protocol of EV isolation from probiotic bacteria, not varying from lab to lab, must be established to achieve consistency in the experimental results in these pre-clinical models. Our current study compared two commonly used methods for EV isolation from biological samples, ultracentrifugation and precipitation, to develop a standard protocol for isolating EVs from the probiotics <i>Lactobacillus acidophilus</i> (LA)<i>,</i> a Gram-positive bacterium, and <i>Escherichia coli</i> Nissle (EcN)<i>,</i> a Gram-negative bacterium. The ultracentrifugation method gave ~1.5-fold higher EV yield for both LA and EcN compared to the precipitation method. Further, EcN released a higher level of EVs compared to LA. EVs were quantified and characterized by nanoparticle-tracking analysis (NTA) and by measuring the specific surface biomarkers using Western blot. Here, we describe our standardized step-by-step protocol for isolating EVs from probiotic bacteria and their characterization."

Here, we genetically tested 9 HD genome-wide association study (GWAS)/MMR genes in mutant Huntingtin (mHtt) mice with 140 inherited CAG repeats (Q140). Knockout (KO) of genes encoding a distinct MMR complex either strongly (Msh3 and Pms1) or moderately (Msh2 and Mlh1) rescues phenotypes with early onset in striatal medium-spiny neurons (MSNs) and late onset in the cortical neurons: somatic CAG-repeat expansion, transcriptionopathy, and mHtt aggregation. Msh3 deficiency ameliorates open-chromatin dysregulation in Q140 neurons. Mechanistically, the fast linear rate of mHtt modal-CAG-repeat expansion in MSNs (8.8 repeats/month) is drastically reduced or stopped by MMR mutants. Msh3 or Pms1 deficiency prevents mHtt aggregation by keeping somatic MSN CAG length below 150. Importantly, Msh3 deficiency corrects synaptic, astrocytic, and locomotor defects in HD mice. Thus, Msh3 and Pms1 drive fast somatic mHtt CAG-expansion rates in HD-vulnerable neurons to elicit repeat-length/threshold-dependent, selective, and progressive pathogenesis in vivo."

MSH3, a DNA mismatch repair protein, modifies HD onset and progression by driving this somatic CAG repeat expansion process. <i>MSH3</i> is relatively tolerant of loss-of-function variation in humans, making it a potential therapeutic target. Here, we show that an <i>MSH3</i>-targeting antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) effectively engaged with its RNA target in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived striatal neurons obtained from a patient with HD carrying <i>125 HTT</i> CAG repeats (the 125 CAG iPSC line). ASO treatment led to a dose-dependent reduction of MSH3 and subsequent stalling of CAG repeat expansion in these striatal neurons. Bulk RNA sequencing revealed a safe profile for <i>MSH3</i> reduction, even when reduced by >95%. Maximal knockdown of MSH3 also effectively slowed CAG repeat expansion in striatal neurons with an otherwise accelerated expansion rate, derived from the 125 CAG iPSC line where <i>FAN1</i> was knocked out by CRISPR-Cas9 editing. Last, we created a knock-in mouse model expressing the human <i>MSH3</i> gene and demonstrated effective in vivo reduction in human <i>MSH3</i> after ASO treatment.

    "abstract": "Over the past two decades, there has been a growing recognition of the physiological importance and pathological implications surrounding the surface diffusion of AMPA receptors (AMPARs) and their diffusional trapping at synapses. AMPAR surface diffusion entails the thermally powered random Brownian lateral movement of these receptors within the plasma membrane, facilitating dynamic exchanges between synaptic and extrasynaptic compartments. This process also enables the activity-dependent diffusional trapping and accumulation of AMPARs at synapses through transient binding to synaptic anchoring slots. Recent research highlights the critical role of synaptic recruitment of AMPARs via diffusional trapping in fundamental neural processes such as the development of the early phases of long-term potentiation (LTP), contextual fear memory, memory consolidation, and sensory input-induced cortical remapping. Furthermore, studies underscore that regulation of AMPAR diffusional trapping is altered across various neurological disease models, including Huntington's disease (HD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and stress-related disorders like depression. Notably, pharmacological interventions aimed at correcting deficits in AMPAR diffusional trapping have demonstrated efficacy in restoring synapse numbers, LTP, and memory functions in these diverse disease models, despite their distinct pathogenic mechanisms. This review provides current insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the dysregulation of AMPAR diffusional trapping, emphasizing its role as a converging point for multiple pathological signaling pathways. We propose that targeting AMPAR diffusional trapping represents a promising early therapeutic strategy to mitigate synaptic plasticity and memory deficits in a spectrum of brain disorders, encompassing but not limited to HD, AD, and stress-related conditions. This approach underscores an integrated therapeutic target amidst the complexity of these neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases."

This 24-week, single-center, randomized, single-blind study evaluated the safety and efficacy of two cognitive rehabilitation strategies in early-to-middle-stage HD patients. Participants were randomized into a computerized cognitive training (CT; n = 13) intervention or a music therapy (MT; n = 16) intervention. A standard of care (SoC; n = 15) group with no active intervention was also involved. Weekly 45-min sessions were conducted. Baseline and endpoint assessments included measures of global cognition, functional, motor, and neuropsychiatric assessments, along with structural and functional neuroimaging. Both CT and MT groups demonstrated significant improvements in primary and secondary cognitive endpoints, including global cognition an composite measures of disease severity. Regression analysis identified longitudinal cognitive score changes as independent predictors of the rate of atrophy in the caudate, putamen, and inferior frontal gyrus. Functional connectivity analysis showed distinct intervention-related effects: CT group exhibited increased connectivity between the central executive and sensorymotor networks, while MT group reduced aberrant connectivity between the central executive and the default-mode network.

Here, we assessed the epigenomic landscape of vulnerable neurons in two reference mouse models of Huntington neurodegenerative disease (HD), using cell-type-specific multi-omics, including temporal analysis at three disease stages via FANS-CUT&Tag. We show accelerated de-repression of developmental genes in HD striatal neurons, involving histone re-acetylation and depletion of H2AK119 ubiquitination and H3K27 trimethylation marks, which are catalyzed by polycomb repressive complexes 1 and 2 (PRC1 and PRC2), respectively. We further identify a PRC1-dependent subcluster of bivalent developmental transcription factors that is re-activated in HD striatal neurons. This mechanism likely involves progressive paralog switching between PRC1-CBX genes, which promotes the upregulation of normally low-expressed PRC1-CBX2/4/8 isoforms in striatal neurons, alongside the down-regulation of predominant PRC1-CBX isoforms in these cells (e.g., CBX6/7).

Oxidative stress has been implicated among other cellular processes in the pathogenesis of HD. Arbutin, a hydroquinone antioxidant, is reportedly neuroprotective in several animal models of neurodegenerative diseases. Hence, this research aimed to investigate the neuroprotective effect of arbutin against HD using in silico, in vitro, and in vivo experimental approaches. Schrodinger software was used for the in-silico studies, while SH-SY5Y cells were used for in-vitro studies. In the in vivo studies, adult Wistar rats were divided into five groups and 3-nitro propionic acid (3-NPA) (10 mg/kg/day,i.p) alone, and with arbutin (50 and 100 mg/kg/day,i.p.) was administered for 21 days. The body weight and behavioral parameters, including locomotor activity and motor coordination, were assessed on the 1st, 7th, 14th & 21st days. On the 22nd day, animals were sacrificed; the striatum was harvested for biochemical, neurochemical, and histopathological assessment. In silico, results indicated that arbutin showed a good binding affinity for target proteins like Akt and Nrf2. Further, arbutin prevented cell death and oxidative stress in SH-SY5Y cells induced by 3-NPA. In addition, arbutin ameliorated the 3-NPA induced motor impairments, purine nucleoside imbalances (adenosine levels and its metabolites hypoxanthine, xanthine, adenine), oxidative stress, and histological alterations in the experimental animals. In conclusion, the present findings indicate that arbutin could be used as an adjuvant for the management of Huntington's disease."

    "title": "Burns, Aging, and Appalachia: The Untold Story of Hospital Stays.",
    "abstract": "Background Burn injuries are among the top 10 causes of trauma and premature death globally. While burns are more prevalent in low-income countries, geriatric burns are disproportionately observed in developed nations, where longer life expectancies result in a larger elderly population. Geriatric burn patients face unique challenges, including slower healing, higher risk of complications, and increased hospital length of stay (LOS), which may be further exacerbated in resource-limited regions such as Appalachia. This study investigates factors influencing hospital LOS in geriatric burn patients aged 65 and older in a resource-constrained region of Appalachia. Variables analyzed include patient demographics, comorbidities, burn-specific characteristics, and the regional healthcare context. Methodology This retrospective cohort study analyzed 209 patients admitted to Cabell Huntington Hospital's Burn Intensive Care Unit between 2017 and 2023. Variables included age, gender, burn severity, total burn surface area (TBSA), inhalation injuries, burn source, comorbidities (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes), smoking history, body mass index, home oxygen use, and discharge status. Statistical analyses included t-tests, analysis of variance, and multivariate regression to identify predictors of LOS. Results The mean LOS was 11.7 ± 10.3 days. Factors significantly associated with longer LOS included inhalation injuries (+8.3 days, p = 0.001) and full-thickness burns (+7.9 days, p < 0.001). Patients who died had significantly longer hospital stays (+5.6 days, p = 0.021). Surprisingly, home oxygen use was associated with shorter LOS (-5.1 days, p = 0.011). Furthermore, discharge status was significant. Patients who expired in the hospital had a longer LOS (+5.6 days, p = 0.021). Age, gender, and comorbidities (COPD, diabetes, smoking) did not significantly impact LOS in this cohort. Higher TBSA was associated with longer LOS (p < 0.001). For every 1% increase in TBSA, LOS increased by an average of 0.445 days. Conclusions Inhalation injuries, burn severity, and burn source are significant predictors of LOS in geriatric burn patients in Appalachia, while regional resource limitations may uniquely influence care outcomes. Identifying factors affecting LOS can guide tailored interventions to improve recovery and reduce hospital stays in resource-constrained settings. Further research is warranted to explore regional disparities in burn care."

    "title": "Peripheral and central elevation of IL-8 in patients with Huntington's disease.",
    "abstract": "Huntington's Disease (HD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative condition characterized by motor, cognitive and psychiatric abnormalities. Immune hyperactivity and dysregulation are common in HD. In addition to the central nervous system, HD patients exhibit systemic innate immune activation and inflammation, which has been shown to contribute to the pathogenic effects of the Huntingtin gene mutation. Upregulation of inflammatory mediators including interferon gamma (IFN-γ) and interleukin (IL)-8 has been observed in animal Huntington's disease models. However, studies on HD patients remain limited. In this study, serum samples from 58 HD patients and 59 age- and gender-matched healthy control individuals were analysed using a bead-based assay, that enabled simultaneous measurement of 13 cytokines and chemokines. Additionally, publicly available transcriptomic data from brain tissues of HD patients and controls were examined. Our results confirm that IL-8 protein levels are significantly higher in HD patients compared to non-HD controls, with the highest levels observed in the moderate HD group. In the control group, we found significant positive correlations between IL-8 levels and both IL-17A and IL-10. However, these correlations were not observed in HD patients, where IL-8 levels were notably positively correlated with pro-inflammatory markers including IFNγ and IL-23. Interestingly, IL-17A levels demonstrated a negative correlation with disease parameters, including CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion and disease burden score. Furthermore, cytokines and chemokines such as IFNγ and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1; CCL2) demonstrated positive correlations with the same disease parameters. In-depth analysis of publicly available bulk RNAseq, and single-nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNAseq) data from two key HD-affected brain regions- the prefrontal cortex and striatum revealed that IL-8 expression is significantly increased in cortex samples from individuals with HD compared to non-HD controls. Moreover, snRNAseq data in the striatum showed higher IL-8 expression in HD patients than in non-HD controls, with a predominant expression in microglia. Overall, our findings support an upregulation of IL-8 in patients with HD, evident in both central degenerating brain regions, and peripheral blood samples. We identified unique immunological signatures associated with the severity of HD and provide potential biomarkers that may reflect immune-pathological mechanisms in HD patients."

    "abstract": "Cognitive and visual impairment are common in Huntington's Disease (HD) and may precede motor diagnosis. We investigate the early presence of visual cognitive deficits in 181 participants, including HD carriers (40 pre-manifest, 30 early manifest, 27 manifest, and 6 reduced penetrance) and 78 healthy controls (HC). Significant differences in visual memory were observed between reduced penetrance and pre-manifest groups (p = .003), with pre-manifest showing worse performance. Age, education, CAG repeats, motor status, executive function, and verbal fluency, accounted for up to 72.8% of the variance in general and visual cognitive functions, with motor status having the strongest impact on visual domains in HD carriers. In pre-manifest HD, visual cognitive domains were primarily influenced by executive function, verbal fluency, age, and CAG repeats, while in early and manifest stages motor status and verbal fluency becomes more influential. ROC analyses showed that especially visuospatial abilities, visual memory, and visual attention (AUC = 0.927, 0.878, 0.874, respectively) effectively differentiated HC and pre-manifest from early and manifest HD. Early assessment of visual cognitive domains, particularly visual memory, could be an early marker of cognitive decline in HD. Our findings highlight the different profiles of impairment in visual cognition across HD carriers."

    "title": "Synaptic plasticity and neuroprotection: The molecular impact of flavonoids on neurodegenerative disease progression.",
    "abstract": "Flavonoids are a broad family of polyphenolic chemicals that are present in a wide variety of fruits, vegetables, and medicinal plants. Because of their neuroprotective qualities, flavonoids have attracted a lot of interest. The potential of flavonoids to control synaptic plasticity-a crucial process underlying memory, learning, and cognitive function-is becoming more and more clear. Dysregulation of synaptic plasticity is a feature of neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (0.4 %), Parkinson's (1-2 %), Alzheimer's (5-7 %), and Huntington's ((0.2 %)). This review discusses the molecular mechanisms via which flavonoids influence synaptic plasticity as well as their therapeutic potential in neurodegenerative diseases. Flavonoids modulate key signaling pathways such as MAPK/ERK and PI3K/Akt/mTOR to support neuroprotection, synaptic plasticity, and neuronal health, while also influencing neurotrophic factors (BDNF, NGF) and their receptors (TrkB, TrkA). They regulate neurotransmitter receptors like GABA, AMPA, and NMDA to balance excitatory and inhibitory transmission, and exert antioxidant effects via the Nrf2-ARE pathway and anti-inflammatory actions by inhibiting NF-κB signaling, highlighting their potential for treating neurodegenerative diseases. These varied reactions support the preservation of synapse function and neuronal integrity in the face of neurodegenerative insults. Flavonoids can reduce the symptoms of neurodegeneration, prevent synaptic loss, and enhance cognitive function, according to experimental studies. However, there are still obstacles to using these findings in clinical settings, such as limited bioavailability and the need for consistent dose. The focus of future research should be on improving flavonoid delivery systems and combining them with conventional medications."

Advances in MRI and chitosan-based drug delivery systems are creating new opportunities for diagnosing and treating neurodegenerative disorders. Exosomes regulate miRNAs and proteins, presenting theranostic potential for Alzheimer's and Huntington's diseases, yet facing delivery and targeting challenges. Exosomal miRNAs, such as miR-1234, miR-5678, and miR-29a, are crucial for the early detection and monitoring of the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. Additionally, novel biomarkers such as SCA27B and FGF14 gene mutations and serum miR-455-3p offer promising noninvasive diagnostic methods for Alzheimer's disease. The expanding role of exosome-derived miRNAs in targeting oncogenes and regulating the cell cycle enhances therapeutic strategies for neurological disorders, opening doors to more personalized and effective disease management."

    "abstract": "Animal diseases have wide-ranging impacts in multiple societal arenas, including agriculture, public health and the environment. These diseases cause significant economic losses for farmers, disrupt food security and present zoonotic risks to human populations. Additionally, they contribute to antimicrobial resistance and a range of environmental issues such as greenhouse gas emissions. The societal and ecological costs of livestock diseases are frequently underrepresented or unaddressed in policy decisions and resource allocations. Social cost-benefit analysis (SCBA) offers a comprehensive framework to evaluate the broad impacts of animal diseases across different sectors. This approach aligns with the One Health concept, which seeks to integrate and optimize the health of humans, animals and the environment. Traditional economic evaluations often focus narrowly on profit maximization within the livestock sector, neglecting wider externalities such as public health and environmental impacts. In contrast, SCBA takes a multi-sectoral whole-system view, considering multiple factors to guide public and private sector investments toward maximizing societal benefits. This paper discusses three separate sector specific (Animal health, Human health, Environmental health) methodologies for quantifying the burden of animal diseases. It then discusses how these estimates can be combined to generate multisectoral estimates of the impacts of animal diseases on human societies and the environment using monetary values. Finally this paper explores how this framework can support the evaluation of interventions from a One Health perspective though SCBA. This integrated assessment framework supports informed decision-making and resource allocation, ultimately contributing to improved public health outcomes, enhanced animal welfare, and greater environmental sustainability."

    "abstract": "A dynamic network of scaffolding molecules, adaptor proteins, and motor proteins work together to orchestrate the movement of proteins, mRNA, and vesicular cargoes. Defects in intracellular transport can often lead to neurodegeneration. Huntingtin (HTT) is a ubiquitously expressed scaffolding protein with a multitude of cellular roles, including regulating the transport of various organelles. HTT is remarkable in its ability to regulate the transport of a wide range of cargoes, including BDNF vesicles, APP vesicles, early endosomes, autophagosomes, lysosomes, and mitochondria. This interaction network allows huntingtin to control microtubule-based transport by kinesin and dynein, as well as actin-based transport by myosin VI. By forming complexes with multiple motor adaptors, huntingtin regulates a variety of cargoes and guides cargoes through the different stages of biosynthesis, signaling, and degradation. Accordingly, pathogenic polyglutamine expansions seen in Huntington's Disease (HD) dysregulate huntingtin transport complexes, resulting in defects in transport and neurodegeneration."

However, there is inter-individual variability in psychiatric expression and progression. This study therefore strives to stratify longitudinal psychiatric signatures that may inform Huntington's disease prognosis, with potential clinical applications. Forty-six Huntington's disease gene carriers (21 premanifest, 25 manifest; 31 female; age range 25-69) underwent short-Problem Behavior Assessment for depression, irritability, apathy, and dysexecutive behaviors for up to six longitudinal visits. The Disease Trajectories software, a machine-learning approach, was employed to perform unsupervised clustering of psychiatric trajectories. Linear fits were calculated for each cluster. Lastly, the main clusters of shared trajectories were assessed for group differences in demographic and clinical characteristics. The Disease Trajectories analysis software identified two main psychiatric patterns comprising premanifest and manifest patients that explained 54% of the sample. These two clusters evinced a dissociation in the development of depression and irritability; the first cluster was defined by increasing irritability with no depression and the second by a rise-and-fall in depression with no irritability. Both clusters showed a longitudinal increase in clinically relevant apathy and dysexecutive behaviors. Ultimately, through the detection of individual-level psychiatric trajectories with machine-learning, this exploratory study reveals that a dissociation of depression and irritability is apparent even in premanifest stages. These findings underscore individual differences in the severity of longitudinal multivariate clinical characteristics for real-world patient stratification, with implications for precision medicine."

In recent years, increasing evidence has posited vascular dysfunction as a significant early event in disease pathogenesis; however, these processes remain to be fully elucidated. High-content immunohistochemical screening studies were conducted on HD middle temporal gyrus (MTG) human brain tissue microarrays (TMAs) to investigate various components of the vascular system, including endothelial cells (UEA-1), pericytes (PDGFRβ), vascular smooth muscle cells (αSMA), extracellular matrix components (ECM; collagen IV and fibronectin), and leakage markers (haemoglobin and fibrinogen). Analyses of vascular markers revealed an increase in the number of vessels in the HD TMA cohort which was associated with advancing striatal pathology and earlier symptom onset. Furthermore, our findings highlight the preservation of pericytes, vascular smooth muscle cells, ECM components, and blood-brain barrier integrity in the HD MTG. Collectively, the TMA findings allude to mild vascular remodelling in the temporal cortex which is known to present with a lesser degree of neuronal degeneration in HD."

To determine whether there are differences in KP metabolites in the CSF and plasma of PwHD versus healthy controls enrolled in the HDClarity study. CSF and plasma samples from 141 PwHD with mild and moderate manifest disease and 75 healthy controls were analyzed for 3-hydroxykynurenine (3-OH-KYN), quinolinic acid, kynurenine, anthranilic acid, kynurenic acid, and tryptophan concentrations using validated high-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) methods. The primary and secondary endpoints compared metabolite concentrations between groups, and an exploratory analysis (PwHD only) evaluated the association between the metabolite levels and severity of disease. No significant differences in CSF or plasma concentrations of any of the six KP metabolites were observed between PwHD and controls, and there were no strong associations between the concentration of any KP metabolite and disease severity. A principal component analysis of the combined CSF and plasma measures showed a substantial positive correlation among all metabolites except for tryptophan in plasma. We found no evidence to support the hypothesis of dysregulation of KP metabolites in HD based on CSF and plasma metabolite levels. The monitoring of KP metabolites in CSF or plasma is unlikely to serve as a pharmacodynamic biomarker for disease progression or therapeutic intervention in HD."

    "abstract": "The LINC (linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton) complex is a critical component of the cellular architecture that bridges the nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton and mediates mechanotransduction to and from the nucleus. Though it plays important roles in all blood vessels, it is in arterioles that this complex plays a pivotal role in maintaining endothelial cell integrity, regulating vascular tone, forming new microvessels and modulating responses to mechanical and biochemical stimuli. It is also important in vascular smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts, where it possibly plays a role in the contractile to secretory phenotypic transformation during atherosclerosis and vascular ageing, and in fibroblasts' migration and inflammatory responses in the adventitia. Physiologically, the LINC complex contributes to the stability of arteriolar structure, adaptations to changes in blood flow and injury repair mechanisms. Pathologically, dysregulation or mutations in LINC complex components can lead to compromised endothelial function, vascular remodelling and exacerbation of cardiovascular diseases such as atherosclerosis (arteriolosclerosis). This review summarizes our current understanding of the roles of the LINC complex in cells from arterioles, highlighting its most important physiological functions, exploring its implications for vascular pathology and emphasizing some of its functional characteristics in endothelial cells. By elucidating the LINC complex's role in health and disease, we aim to provide insights that could improve future therapeutic strategies targeting LINC complex-related vascular disorders."

    "abstract": "Huntington's disease (HD) is caused by polyglutamine (polyQ) repeat expansions in the huntingtin gene. HD-causative polyQ alleles lead to protein aggregation, which is a prerequisite for disease. Translation fidelity modifies protein aggregation, and several studies suggest that mutating one or two glutamine (Gln) residues in polyQ reduces aggregation. Thus, we hypothesized that missense suppression of Gln codons with other amino acids will reduce polyQ aggregate formation in cells. In neuroblastoma cells, we assessed tRNA variants that misread Gln codons with serine (tRNA<sup>Ser</sup> <sub>C/UUG</sub>) or alanine (tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> <sub>C/UUG</sub>). The tRNAs with the CUG anticodon were more effective at suppressing the CAG repeats in polyQ, and serine and alanine mis-incorporation had differential impacts on polyQ. The expression of tRNA<sup>Ser</sup> <sub>CUG</sub> reduced polyQ protein production as well as both soluble and insoluble aggregate formation. In contrast, cells expressing tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> <sub>CUG</sub> selectively decreased insoluble polyQ aggregate formation by 2-fold. Mass spectrometry confirmed Ala mis-incorporation at an average level of ∼20% per Gln codon. Cells expressing the missense suppressor tRNAs showed no cytotoxic effects and no defects in growth or global protein synthesis levels. Our findings demonstrate that tRNA-dependent missense suppression of Gln codons is well tolerated in mammalian cells and significantly reduces polyQ levels and aggregates that cause HD."

These processes have been found to be involved in the pathological mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, the research history and milestone events of studying metal ions, including iron, manganese, copper, and zinc in neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Huntington's disease (HD), will be introduced. Then, the upstream regulators, downstream effector, and crosstalk of mental ions under both physiologic and pathologic conditions will be summarized. Finally, the therapeutic effects of metal ion chelators, such as clioquinol, quercetin, curcumin, coumarin, and their derivatives for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases will be discussed. Additionally, the promising results and limitations observed in clinical trials of these metal ion chelators will also be addressed.

To examine associations between gestational exposure to nonpersistent pesticides and newborn outcomes and identify critical windows of susceptibility. In a Ghanaian pregnancy cohort, we measured select biomarkers of organophosphate, pyrethroid, and herbicide pesticides in repeated urine samples (1-5/participant). We developed a new model for assessing critical windows of vulnerability from irregularly-timed measurements of nonpersistent pesticides, leveraging strengths from multiple informant and distributed lag models. We estimated associations of biomarker concentrations with newborn anthropometrics and gestational length, adjusting for confounders and exploring effect modification by infant sex and placental malaria. 1,211 pregnant women contributed 3,786 gestational urinary samples. In models assuming constant associations with exposures across pregnancy, in a given week a doubling of 3-phenoxybenzoic acid (pyrethroid biomarker) was associated with a -15.8 g difference in birth weight (95 % CI:-28.1,-3.6), and a doubling of the 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D, herbicide biomarker) was associated with an 11.1 g increase in birth weight (95 % CI:1.0,21.1). In time-varying models, significant associations were identified for pyrethroid exposure measured between weeks 16-27, and for 2,4-D exposure measured during weeks 25-33. Organophosphates were not associated with birth weight. No associations were found for birth length or head circumference for any pesticide. In constant association models, a doubling of weekly 2,4-D was associated with a 0.05 week increase in gestational length (95 %CI:0.01,0.09); no associations were found with other biomarkers. We identified associations between gestational exposure to nonpersistent pesticides and both birth size and gestational length. Extending multiple informant models to account for the complex data structure allowed us to discern effects in opposing directions by distinct pesticide classes.

Alpha-Synuclein seed amplification assays (α-syn SAA) may detect aggregated synuclein before symptoms occur. Data from the Parkinson Associated Risk Syndrome Study (PARS) have shown that individuals with hyposmia, without motor or cognitive symptoms, are enriched for dopamine transporter imaging (DAT) deficit and are at high risk to develop clinical parkinsonism or related synucleinopathies. α-syn aggregates in CSF were measured in 100 PARS participants using α-syn SAA. CSF α-syn SAA was positive in 48% (34/71) of hyposmic compared to 4% (1/25) of normosmic PARS participants (relative risk, 11.97; 95% CI, 1.73-82.95). Among α-syn SAA positive hyposmics 65% remained without a DAT deficit for up to four years follow-up. α-syn SAA positive hyposmics were at higher risk of having DAT deficit (12 of 34) compared to α-syn SAA negative hyposmics (4 of 37; relative risk, 3.26; 95% CI, 1.16-9.16), and 7 of 12 α-syn SAA positive hyposmics with DAT deficit developed symptoms consistent with synucleinopathy. Approximately fifty percent of PARS participants with hyposmia, easily detected using simple, widely available tests, have synuclein pathology detected by α-syn SAA. Approximately, one third (12 of 34) α-syn SAA positive hyposmic individuals also demonstrate DAT deficit.

Parkinson`s disease is relentless in progression and irreversible in nature, for which there is no cure. Therapies are only used to attenuate motor symptoms. As Parkinson`s disease is primarily defined by degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, and considering that neuroinflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction in these neurons are key factors contributing to disease progression, alternative therapies should aim to preserve healthy mitochondria. Method. Eligible studies on the effect of Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) on Parkinson`s disease were collected from PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus, Web of Science and Cochrane library for clinical, in-vivo, and in-vitro studies. Result. UDCA and its taurine conjugate (TUDCA), which are endogenous bile acids, have exhibited neuroprotective potential in various neurological conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease, in both animal experimental models and clinical investigations. This is attributed to three significant properties, in addition to their capability to cross the blood-brain barrier. First, their anti-inflammatory properties are manifested through the reduction of significant inflammatory factors such as tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin 1β and other related elements. Second, their antioxidant property is marked by an increase in the expression of superoxide dismuthase, glutathione peroxidase and other antioxidant enzymes. The third property is the antiapoptotic activity, characterized by decreased caspase-3 activity and lower expression of pro-apoptotic Bax in the striatum. Conclusion. Based on this comprehensive review, UDCA and TUDCA have the potential to be considered as a therapeutic agent in the management of the Parkinson's disease."

To assess the role of sGFAP and sNfL and clinical biomarkers in different disease stages and correlate with disease progression. HD mutation carriers were categorized into clinical stages according to their motor symptoms and functional capacities. The Unified HD Rating Scale, cognitive assessments and olfactory tests were used to characterize the patients clinically. Furthermore, sNfL and sGFAP levels were assessed. We consecutively included 44 HD mutation carriers (13 premanifest HD (preHD), 18 in early (early HD) and 13 in advanced (advanced HD) disease stages) and 19 healthy controls (HC). Advanced HD patients performed worse on all clinical tasks and had higher sGFAP and sNfL levels compared to other groups (all p values < 0.05). We did not find difference in sGFAP levels between the preHD, early HD and HC group (all p values > 0.05). In contrast, sNfL levels differed significantly between preHD and early HD, and HC (all p values < 0.05). ROC curve analysis revealed that the AUC of sGFAP (0.970) exhibited superior discriminatory accuracy compared to sNfL (0.791) levels in separating advanced from early HD patients. By contrast, ROC curve analysis revealed that the AUC of sNFL (0.988) exhibited superior discriminatory accuracy compared to sGFAP (0.609) levels in separating all HD mutation carriers from HC.

A risk of bias assessment was performed for each article. Fifteen articles qualified for critical evaluation: 10 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (five placebo-controlled and five cross-over) and five open label studies. One RCT reported improvement of the overall NPS with nabilone treatment; another RCT reported that fluoxetine slightly improved irritability. Lower-level evidence from open studies suggests that the atypical antipsychotics cariprazine, olanzapine and risperidone may improve overall NPS, and that cariprazine, venlafaxine XR and olanzapine may improve depression. In addition, olanzapine may improve obsessive thoughts, aggression, anxiety and irritability. We conclude that although NPS in HD are common, hardly any clinical trials have addressed their treatment. As a result, convincing evidence that could guide clinical practice is lacking. More focused, and larger, multicenter trials focusing on NPS are urgently needed to generate the knowledge necessary to support the development of evidence-based clinical treatment guidelines."

    "title": "Exploring immunotherapeutic strategies for neurodegenerative diseases: a focus on Huntington's disease and Prion diseases.",
    "abstract": "Immunotherapy has emerged as a promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders, which are characterized by the progressive loss of neurons and impaired cognitive functions. In this review, active and passive immunotherapeutic strategies that help address the underlying pathophysiology of Huntington's disease (HD) and prion diseases by modulating the immune system are discussed. The current landscape of immunotherapeutic strategies, including monoclonal antibodies and vaccine-based approaches, to treat these diseases is highlighted, along with their potential benefits and mechanisms of action. Immunotherapy generally works by targeting disease-specific proteins, which serve as the pathological hallmarks of these diseases. Additionally, the review addresses the challenges and limitations associated with immunotherapy. For HD, immunotherapeutic approaches focus on neutralizing the toxic effects of mutant huntingtin and tau proteins, thereby reducing neurotoxicity. Immunotherapeutic approaches targeting flanking sequences, rather than the polyglutamine tract in the mutant huntingtin protein, have yielded promising outcomes for patients with HD. In prion diseases, therapies attempt to prevent or eliminate misfolded proteins that cause neurodegeneration. The major challenge in prion diseases is immune tolerance. Approaches to overcome the highly tolerogenic nature of the prion protein have been discussed. A common hurdle in delivering antibodies is the blood‒brain barrier, and strategies that can breach this barrier are being investigated. As protein aggregation and neurotoxicity are related, immunotherapeutic strategies being developed for other neurodegenerative diseases could be repurposed to target protein aggregation in HD and prion diseases. While significant advances in this field have been achieved, continued research and development are necessary to overcome the existing limitations, which will help in shaping the future of immunotherapy as a strategy for managing neurological disorders."

    "title": "Application of Anti-Motion Ultra-Fast Quantitative MRI in Neurological Disorder Imaging: Insights From Huntington's Disease.",
    "abstract": "Conventional quantitative MRI (qMRI) scan is time-consuming and highly sensitive to movements, posing great challenges for quantitative images of individuals with involuntary movements, such as Huntington's disease (HD). To evaluate the potential of our developed ultra-fast qMRI technique, multiple overlapping-echo detachment (MOLED), in overcoming involuntary head motion and its capacity to quantitatively assess tissue changes in HD. Prospective. A phantom comprising 13 tubes of MnCl<sub>2</sub> at varying concentrations, 5 healthy volunteers (male/female: 1/4), 22 HD patients (male/female: 14/8) and 27 healthy controls (male/female: 15/12). 3.0 T. MOLED-T2 sequence, MOLED-T2* sequence, T2-weighted spin-echo sequence, T1-weighted gradient echo sequence, and T2-dark-fluid sequence. T1-weighted images were reconstructed into high-resolution images, followed by segmentation to delineate regions of interest (ROIs). Subsequently, the MOLED T2 and T2* maps were aligned with the high-resolution images, and the ROIs were transformed into the MOLED image space using the transformation matrix and warp field. Finally, T2 and T2* values were extracted from the MOLED relaxation maps. Bland-Altman analysis, independent t test, Mann-Whitney U test, Pearson correlation analysis, and Spearman correlation analysis, P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. MOLED-T2 and MOLED-T2* sequences demonstrated good accuracy (Meandiff = - 0.20%, SDdiff = 1.05%, and Meandiff = -1.73%, SDdiff = 10.98%, respectively), and good repeatability (average intraclass correlation coefficient: 0.856 and 0.853, respectively). More important, MOLED T2 and T2* maps remained artifact-free across all HD patients, even in the presence of apparent head motions. Moreover, there were significant differences in T2 and T2* values across multiple ROIs between HD and controls. The ultra-fast scanning capabilities of MOLED effectively mitigate the impact of head movements, offering a robust solution for quantitative imaging in HD. Moreover, T2 and T2* values derived from MOLED provide powerful capabilities for quantifying tissue changes. Quantitative MRI scan is time-consuming and sensitive to movements. Consequently, obtaining quantitative images is challenging for patients with involuntary movements, such as those with Huntington's Disease (HD). In response, a newly developed MOLED technique has been introduced, promising to resist motion through ultra-fast scan. This technique has demonstrated excellent accuracy and reproducibility and importantly all HD patient's MOLED maps remained artifacts-free. Additionally, there were significant differences in T2 and T2∗ values across ROIs between HD and controls. The robust resistance of MOLED to motion makes it particularly suitable for quantitative assessments in patients prone to involuntary movements. 2 TECHNICAL EFFICACY: Stage 1."

    "abstract": "Vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) is a proton-monoamine antiporter that is widely expressed in central and peripheral neurons and plays a crucial role in loading monoamine neurotransmitters into secretory vesicles. Dysfunction of VMAT2 causes many neuropsychiatric disorders, such as depression and Parkinson's disease. Consequently, VMAT2 is a valid and important therapeutic target. Reserpine alleviates symptoms of hypertension via potent inhibition of VMAT2. Tetrabenazine selectively inhibits VMAT2 and has been used for the management of chorea, including Huntington's disease. Decades of extensive studies have defined the substrate specificity and transport kinetics of VMAT2. However, the structure and precise mechanisms of monoamine recognition and drug inhibition in VMAT2 remain unknown. Recently, we determined an ensemble of high-resolution cryo-EM structures of human VMAT2 in three distinct states bound to multiple substrates and inhibitors. These results lay a structural foundation for a comprehensive understanding of substrate recognition and transport, drug inhibition, and proton coupling in VMAT2 and shed light on future therapeutic development."

    "abstract": "Using a multi-informant approach, the authors assessed the psychiatric symptoms of adolescents and young adults with or without the huntingtin gene expansion and examined the association of psychiatric symptoms with cumulative disease exposure, a measure taking into account age and genetic data. The sample included 110 participants with (N=71) or without (N=39) the gene expansion, along with 85 family members who provided collateral reports. Saliva samples were used for genetic testing. Participants reported psychiatric symptoms with the age- and informant-appropriate Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment measure. Family member ratings indicated that young people (ages 10-39) with the gene expansion were more likely to exhibit depression symptoms, attention difficulties, and behavior problems compared with those without the gene expansion. Self-reports of these symptoms did not differ between the two groups and indicated elevated depression symptoms, attention difficulties, thought problems, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms in both groups. In family member reports, 25% and 15% of the individuals with the gene expansion exceeded the clinical cutoffs for internalizing and attention difficulties, respectively. Little support was found for an association between psychiatric symptoms and cumulative disease exposure. These findings suggest that young people from families affected by Huntington's disease are at elevated risk for psychiatric symptoms regardless of gene status or cumulative disease exposure. However, findings differed depending on the informant type. These results emphasize a need to screen for and monitor the psychiatric symptoms of all young people from families affected by Huntington's disease regardless of gene status."

    "abstract": "Chemical exchange saturation transfer magnetic resonance imaging is an advanced imaging technique that enables the detection of compounds at low concentrations with high sensitivity and spatial resolution and has been extensively studied for diagnosing malignancy and stroke. In recent years, the emerging exploration of chemical exchange saturation transfer magnetic resonance imaging for detecting pathological changes in neurodegenerative diseases has opened up new possibilities for early detection and repetitive scans without ionizing radiation. This review serves as an overview of chemical exchange saturation transfer magnetic resonance imaging with detailed information on contrast mechanisms and processing methods and summarizes recent developments in both clinical and preclinical studies of chemical exchange saturation transfer magnetic resonance imaging for Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and Huntington's disease. A comprehensive literature search was conducted using databases such as PubMed and Google Scholar, focusing on peer-reviewed articles from the past 15 years relevant to clinical and preclinical applications. The findings suggest that chemical exchange saturation transfer magnetic resonance imaging has the potential to detect molecular changes and altered metabolism, which may aid in early diagnosis and assessment of the severity of neurodegenerative diseases. Although promising results have been observed in selected clinical and preclinical trials, further validations are needed to evaluate their clinical value. When combined with other imaging modalities and advanced analytical methods, chemical exchange saturation transfer magnetic resonance imaging shows potential as an in vivo biomarker, enhancing the understanding of neuropathological mechanisms in neurodegenerative diseases."

    "title": "Estrogen-related receptor gamma is a regulator of mitochondrial, autophagy, and immediate-early gene programs in spiny projection neurons: Relevance for transcriptional changes in Huntington disease.",
    "abstract": "Mitochondrial dysfunction, transcriptional dysregulation, and protein aggregation are hallmarks of multiple neurodegenerative disorders, including Huntington's disease (HD). Strategies are needed to counteract these processes to restore neuronal health and function in HD. Recent evidence indicates that the transcription factor estrogen-related receptor gamma (ERRγ/Esrrg) is required for normal expression of mitochondrial, synaptic, and autophagy genes in neurons. Further, overexpression of Esrrg in dopaminergic neurons reduces synuclein load in the pre-formed fibril model of synucleinopathy. For these reasons, we sought to understand ERRγ's role in transcriptional regulation in spiny projection neurons (SPNs), one of the neuronal populations vulnerable to transcriptional dysregulation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and protein aggregation in HD. Here, we demonstrate that developmental deletion of Esrrg selectively in SPNs causes a transcriptional pattern consistent with a reduction of Drd1 and Drd2-positive neurons in the mouse dorsolateral striatum. To avoid effects of developmental deletion and explore Esrrg's role within adult SPN populations, we deleted or overexpressed Esrrg in adult SPNs. While overexpression was sufficient to increase the expression of mitochondrial and lysosome-related transcripts, Esrrg deletion surprisingly caused increased expression of immediate-early genes and genes with enrichment of binding sites for transcriptional repressors. In contrast, these genes were downregulated by Esrrg overexpression. Concordantly, Esrrg-deficient mice exhibited lack of amphetamine-induced hyperactivity and further upregulation of immediate-early genes. To determine whether the alterations observed with ERRγ modulation have any relevance for understanding transcriptional changes in SPNs in neurodegeneration, we measured Esrrg and its responsive genes in two mouse models of HD. We found an increase in Esrrg expression in HD models, accompanied by a transcriptional profile with similarities to that observed with Esrrg overexpression, suggesting the existence of an ERRγ-dependent, stress-related response. Altogether, these studies suggest that ERRγ is a key activator of mitochondrial and lysosomal transcripts in SPNs with a potential bi-functional role as a mediator of immediate-early gene repression. Ongoing studies are investigating mechanisms underlying ERRγ's roles in transcriptional activation and repression in SPNs to inform strategies to promote neuroprotective actions of ERRγ in SPNs in HD."

    "abstract": "Shorter weeknight sleep duration has not been assessed as a mediating mechanism linking earlier pubertal timing to a greater burden of adolescent depression symptoms. Among 1138 participants (48.6 % female) from Project Viva, a pre-birth longitudinal cohort, we examined relationships among pubertal timing measures, actigraphy-captured and self-reported weeknight sleep duration across mid-adolescence, and depression symptoms in late adolescence. We assessed pubertal timing using age at peak height velocity, self-reported adrenarche (Tanner pubic hair stage) and parent-reported Pubertal Development Scale scores in early adolescence. Relationships were adjusted for age, sex, mid-childhood BMI, and socioeconomic status; effect modification by sex was considered throughout. The mediational g-formula estimated the indirect effect of pubertal timing on depression symptoms via weeknight sleep duration. All measures of earlier pubertal timing predicted shorter actigraphy-measured sleep duration; self-reported adrenarche predicted self-reported sleep duration and depression symptoms. No effect modification by sex was found. In both sexes, a 1-stage advance in adrenarche was associated with less (-0.14 h (95 % CI -0.23,-0.05)) self-reported sleep on weeknights across the mid-adolescent years. The relationship between earlier adrenarche and depression symptoms was mediated by self-reported weeknight sleep duration - a decrease in sleep duration in mid-adolescent years attributable to a 1-stage advance in adrenarche increased depression symptoms by 0.22 points (95 % CI 0.08,0.40). The geographic specificity and attrition in Project Viva limit the generalizability of our findings. Maintaining adequate weeknight sleep across adolescent years may mitigate the impact of earlier adrenarche on depressed mood in late adolescence."

Of 62 people variously charged with homicide, assault, child sexual assault, breach of conditions, property and larceny offences, driving offences, perverting the course of justice and arson, 46 were identified as having executive dysfunction, either as stated by medical expert witnesses or implicitly, due to conditions like Huntington's disease and frontotemporal dementia. Offending history was found to differ depending on offence type and dementia type. Executive dysfunction appears to underly offending in the sample; furthermore, some disease factors may combine to 'inhibit' or 'permit' offending. Permitting factors include executive dysfunction and younger age at time of offending; inhibitory factors include dementia-related impacts on mobility, memory and reaction speed."

    "abstract": "Our objective was to develop and assess the psychometric properties of relevant bolt-on items for the EQ-5D-5L in patients with rare diseases (RDs). Nineteen new EQ-5D-5L bolt-ons were developed based on literature review, expert input, and qualitative interviews and focus groups with patients, caregivers, and representatives of patient associations. A nationwide, cross-sectional, web-based survey in China included patients or caregivers of patients with 31 RDs in China (n = 9190). In each RDs, participants completed the EQ-5D-5L and 3 of 20 (1 existing and 19 newly developed) bolt-ons. Ceiling, explanatory power, convergent, divergent, and known-group validity were examined. Among the bolt-ons, itching had the lowest ceiling (6.5%), whereas social relationships had the highest (42.2%). The absolute reduction in the ceiling of the EQ-5D-5L with the addition of any bolt-ons was limited, ranging from 0 (respiratory problems) to 8.3% points (isolation). Dignity and vitality resulted in the largest increase in explained variance in EQ VAS. The isolation, fertility, and visual acuity bolt-ons showed good divergent validity from the EQ-5D-5L items. There was strong convergent validity between SF-12 and conceptually related bolt-ons (eg, physical health composite and muscle problems bolt-on). Various bolt-ons improved the known-groups validity in specific patient groups, eg, Huntington's disease (oral expressions), scleroderma (dexterity), myasthenia gravis (muscle problems), neuromyelitis optica and multiple sclerosis (fatigue), Marfan syndrome (self-image), and Pompe disease (safety). The EQ-5D-5L shows sufficient validity in most RDs, but incorporating relevant, specific bolt-ons could enhance its ability to more comprehensively assess health-related quality of life in these patients."

In this review, we explore shared astrocytic alterations across neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and frontotemporal lobe degeneration. Assessing recent datasets of single-nucleus RNA-sequencing of human brains, a theme emerges of common alterations in astrocyte state across disorders including in neuroinflammation, synaptic organization, metabolic support, and the cellular stress response. Immune pathways are upregulated by astrocytes across disorders and may exacerbate neurodegeneration. Dysregulated expression of synaptogenic factors could contribute to synaptic loss, while compromised metabolic support affects neuronal homeostasis. On the other hand, upregulated responses to cellular stress may represent a protective response of astrocytes and thus mitigate pathology. Understanding these shared responses offers insights into disease progression and provides potential therapeutic targets for various neurodegenerative disorders."

    "abstract": "Altered protein conformation can cause incurable neurodegenerative disorders. Mutations in <i>SERPINI1</i>, the gene encoding neuroserpin, can alter protein conformation resulting in cytotoxic aggregation leading to neuronal death. Familial encephalopathy with neuroserpin inclusion bodies (FENIB) is a rare autosomal dominant progressive myoclonic epilepsy that progresses to dementia and premature death. We developed HEK293T and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) models of FENIB, harboring a patient-specific pathogenic <i>SERPINI1</i> variant or stably overexpressing mutant neuroserpin fused to GFP (MUT NS-GFP). Here, we utilized a personalized adenine base editor (ABE)-mediated approach to correct the pathogenic variant efficiently and precisely to restore neuronal dendritic morphology. ABE-treated MUT NS-GFP cells demonstrated reduced inclusion size and number. Using an inducible MUT NS-GFP neuron system, we identified early prevention of toxic protein expression allowed aggregate clearance, while late prevention halted further aggregation. To address several challenges for clinical applications of gene correction, we developed a neuron-specific engineered virus-like particle to optimize neuronal ABE delivery, resulting in higher correction efficiency. Our findings provide a targeted strategy that may treat FENIB and potentially other neurodegenerative diseases due to altered protein conformation such as Alzheimer's and Huntington's diseases."

    "abstract": "Despite advancements in understanding Huntington's disease (HD) over the past two decades, absence of disease-modifying treatments remains a challenge. Accurately characterizing progression states is crucial for developing effective therapeutic interventions. Various factors contribute to this challenge, including the need for precise methods that can account for the complex nature of HD progression. This study aims to address this gap by leveraging the concept of the brain's biological age as a foundation for a data-driven clustering method to delineate various states of progression. Brain-predicted age, influenced by somatic expansion and its impact on brain volumes, offers a promising avenue for stratification by stratifying subgroups and determining the optimal timing for interventions. To achieve this, data from 953 participants across diverse cohorts, including PREDICT-HD, TRACK-HD, and IMAGE-HD, were meticulously analyzed. Brain-predicted age was computed using sophisticated algorithms, and participants were categorized into four groups based on CAG and age product score. Unsupervised k-means clustering with brain-predicted age difference (brain-PAD) was then employed to identify distinct progression states. The analysis revealed significant disparities in brain-predicted age between HD participants and controls, with these differences becoming more pronounced as the disease progressed. Brain-PAD demonstrated a correlation with disease severity, effectively identifying five distinct progression states characterized by significant longitudinal disparities. These findings highlight the potential of brain-PAD in capturing HD progression states, thereby enhancing prognostic methodologies and providing valuable insights for future clinical trial designs and interventions. © 2025 The Author(s).

However, research measuring and evaluating it in American Indians is needed. We recruited American Indians from 3 regional centers for longitudinal examinations (2010-13, n = 818; 2017-19, n = 403) including MRI, cognitive, clinical, and questionnaire data. We defined cognitive reserve by measuring the residual from individual regressions of cognitive tests over imaged brain volumes, adjusted for age and sex. Analyses examined three different metrics of cognitive reserve against sociodemographic, clinical, and longitudinal cognitive data in causal mediation models. Better cognitive reserve was significantly associated with more education, higher income, lower prevalence of depression, lower prevalence of diabetes, and lower prevalence of kidney disease, but we found no statistically significant evidence for an association with plasma biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias, APOE e4 carrier status, alcohol use, body mass, or hypertension. Better cognitive reserve was associated with better cognitive function over mean 6.7 years follow-up (range 4-9 years); and the association for education with cognition over time was mediated in part (15-24%) by cognitive reserve. Cognitive reserve, although challenging to measure, appears important for understanding the range of cognitive aging in American Indians."

Although contemporary clinical and neurogenetic understanding of Huntington disease (HD) is thanks to a decades-long study of a Venezuelan cohort, there are a limited number of studies that have evaluated racial and ethnic disparities in HD. The goal of this study was to evaluate disparities in time from symptom onset to time of diagnosis of HD. Using the ENROLL-HD periodic data set 5 (PDS5), we performed sequential multivariate linear regressions to evaluate sociodemographic factors associated with disparities in time to diagnosis (TTD) for gene-positive individuals (CAG repeats 36+) in the North America region. Sensitivity analyses included imputed multivariate regression analysis of individuals with a total motor score (TMS) of 10 or higher and those with 40+ CAG repeats. We also used descriptive statistics to present TTD data in other ENROLL-HD participating regions. Among 4717 gene-positive participants in the North American region, 89.5% identified as White, 3.4% as Hispanic or Latino, and 2.3% as African American/Black. The average TTD in the group was 3.78. When adjusting for clinical and sociodemographic variables, Black participants were diagnosed with HD 1 year later than White participants (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Additional factors associated with a later diagnosis included psychiatric symptoms as initial HD symptom, unemployment during baseline ENROLL visit, and higher educational attainment. Sensitivity analysis of gene-positive (36+ CAG) participants with a TMS of 10 or higher and of those with 40+ CAG repeats yielded similar findings. Across multiple statistical models, Black ENROLL-HD participants were diagnosed with HD 1 year later than White participants. Clinical factors suggesting a delay in HD diagnosis included psychiatric symptoms at disease onset and a negative family history of HD. Unemployment during baseline visit and higher educational attainment were sociodemographic factors suggestive of a later diagnosis. Additional multicenter qualitative and quantitative studies are needed to better understand reasons for delays in HD diagnosis among Black individuals, and the role of social and structural determinants of health in obtaining a timely HD diagnosis."

AEP cleaves amyloid precursor protein (APP), tau (microtubule-associated protein tau), α- synuclein (α-syn), SET (a 39-KDa phosphoprotein widely expressed in various tissues and localizes predominantly in the nucleus), and TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43), and promotes their aggregation, contributing to Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease, multiple sclerosis (MS), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) pathogenesis. Abundant evidence supports the notion that CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β (C/EBPβ)/AEP may play an important role in NDDs. Developing its small molecule inhibitors is a promising treatment of NDDs. However, current research suggests that the pathophysiological mechanism of the C/EBPβ/AEP pathway is very complex in NDDs. This review summarizes the structure of C/EBPβ and AEP, their major physiological functions, potential pathogenesis, their small molecule inhibitors, and how C/EBPβ/AEP offers a novel pathway for the treatment of NDDs."

    "abstract": "The three-dimensional structure of proteins, achieved through the folding of the nascent polypeptide chain in vivo, is largely facilitated by molecular chaperones, which are crucial for determining protein functionality. In addition to aiding in the folding process, chaperones target misfolded proteins for degradation, acting as a quality control system within the cell. Defective protein folding has been implicated in a wide range of clinical conditions, including neurodegenerative and metabolic disorders. It is now well understood that the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease shares a common mechanism: the accumulation of misfolded proteins, which aggregate and become toxic to cells. Among the family of molecular chaperones, Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs) are highly expressed in response to cellular stress and play a pivotal role in preventing protein aggregation. Specific chaperones, particularly HSPs, are now recognized as critical in halting the accumulation and aggregation of misfolded proteins in these conditions. Consequently, these chaperones are increasingly considered promising pharmacological targets for the treatment of protein aggregation-related diseases. This review highlights research exploring the potential roles of specific molecular chaperones in disorders characterized by the accumulation of misfolded proteins."

    "abstract": "A significant proportion of individuals maintain healthy cognitive function despite having extensive Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology, known as cognitive resilience. Understanding the molecular mechanisms that protect these individuals can identify therapeutic targets for AD dementia. This study aims to define molecular and cellular signatures of cognitive resilience, protection and resistance, by integrating genetics, bulk RNA, and single-nucleus RNA sequencing data across multiple brain regions from AD, resilient, and control individuals. We analyzed data from the Religious Order Study and the Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP), including bulk (n=631) and multi-regional single nucleus (n=48) RNA sequencing. Subjects were categorized into AD, resilient, and control based on β-amyloid and tau pathology, and cognitive status. We identified and prioritized protected cell populations using whole genome sequencing-derived genetic variants, transcriptomic profiling, and cellular composition distribution. Transcriptomic results, supported by GWAS-derived polygenic risk scores, place cognitive resilience as an intermediate state in the AD continuum. Tissue-level analysis revealed 43 genes enriched in nucleic acid metabolism and signaling that were differentially expressed between AD and resilience. Only GFAP (upregulated) and KLF4 (downregulated) showed differential expression in resilience compared to controls. Cellular resilience involved reorganization of protein folding and degradation pathways, with downregulation of Hsp90 and selective upregulation of Hsp40, Hsp70, and Hsp110 families in excitatory neurons. Excitatory neuronal subpopulations in the entorhinal cortex (ATP8B1+ and MEF2C<sup>high</sup>) exhibited unique resilience signaling through neurotrophin (modulated by LINGO1) and angiopoietin (ANGPT2/TEK) pathways. We identified MEF2C, ATP8B1, and RELN as key markers of resilient excitatory neuronal populations, characterized by selective vulnerability in AD. Protective rare variant enrichment highlighted vulnerable populations, including somatostatin (SST) inhibitory interneurons, validated through immunofluorescence showing co-expression of rare variant associated RBFOX1 and KIF26B in SST+ neurons in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. The maintenance of excitatory-inhibitory balance emerges as a key characteristic of resilience. We identified molecular and cellular hallmarks of cognitive resilience, an intermediate state in the AD continuum. Resilience mechanisms include preservation of neuronal function, maintenance of excitatory/inhibitory balance, and activation of protective signaling pathways. Specific excitatory neuronal populations appear to play a central role in mediating cognitive resilience, while a subset of vulnerable SST interneurons likely provide compensation against AD-associated dysregulation. This study offers a framework to leverage natural protective mechanisms to mitigate neurodegeneration and preserve cognition in AD."

Similar patterns were observed between connectivity (thalamus to dentate nucleus and anterior lobe) and cognitive performance scores across all subjects (p<0.05, r <sub>Den</sub> =-0.17, r <sub>Ant</sub> =-0.18). In the premanifest TRACK-HD cohort, connectivity of multiple thalamo-cerebellar connections correlated with years to onset, revealing distinct patterns for patients with low versus high motor scores, again indicative of potential transient alterations. Exploratory non-parametric regression of serial imaging data further supported these findings. Transient changes in thalamo-cerebellar connectivity are seen in premanifest HD with increasing progression. More studies are needed to validate this potentially useful biomarker."

    "title": "Evaluating polyglutamine protein aggregation and toxicity in transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans models of Huntington's disease.",
    "abstract": "Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a repeat of the cytosine-adenine-guanine trinucleotide (CAG) in the huntingtin gene (HTT). This results in the translation of a mutant huntingtin (mHTT) protein with an abnormally long polyglutamine (polyQ) repeat. The pathology of HD leads to neuronal cell loss, motor abnormalities, and dementia. Currently, the pathogenesis of HD remains incompletely understood, and available treatments only address symptoms. Caenorhabditis elegans has been used as a model for neurodegenerative diseases, enabling the exploration of the molecular, cellular, and physiological mechanisms underlying HD pathogenesis. It also facilitates the investigation of potential therapeutic targets and interventions. Here, we describe common experiments employed to assess polyQ aggregation and toxicity in transgenic C. elegans models of HD, utilizing fluorescent markers to detect protein aggregation and neuron degeneration, in addition to specific behavioral assays (thrash frequency, nose touch response, and octanol response)."

    "abstract": "Electronic health record (EHR) systems contain a wealth of clinical data stored as both codified data and free-text narrative notes (NLP). The complexity of EHR presents challenges in feature representation, information extraction, and uncertainty quantification. To address these challenges, we proposed an efficient Aggregated naRrative Codified Health (ARCH) records analysis to generate a large-scale knowledge graph (KG) for a comprehensive set of EHR codified and narrative features. Using data from 12.5 million Veterans Affairs patients, ARCH first derives embedding vectors and generates similarities along with associated p-values to measure the strength of relatedness between clinical features with statistical certainty quantification. Next, ARCH performs a sparse embedding regression to remove indirect linkage between features to build a sparse KG. Finally, ARCH was validated on various clinical tasks, including detecting known relationships between entity pairs, predicting drug side effects, disease phenotyping, as well as sub-typing Alzheimer's disease patients. ARCH produces high-quality clinical embeddings and KG for over 60,000 codified and narrative EHR concepts. The KG and embeddings are visualized in the R-shiny powered web-API.<sup>3</sup> ARCH achieved high accuracy in detecting EHR concept relationships, with AUCs of 0.926 (codified) and 0.861 (NLP) for similar EHR concepts, and 0.810 (codified) and 0.843 (NLP) for related pairs. It detected drug side effects with a 0.723 AUC, which improved to 0.826 after fine-tuning. Using both codified and NLP features, the detection power increased significantly. Compared to other methods, ARCH has superior accuracy and enhances weakly supervised phenotyping algorithms' performance. Notably, it successfully categorized Alzheimer's patients into two subgroups with varying mortality rates. The proposed ARCH algorithm generates large-scale high-quality semantic representations and knowledge graph for both codified and NLP EHR features, useful for a wide range of predictive modeling tasks."

It is essential for the proper growth and development of the body and has a positive effect on the functioning of the digestive, cardiovascular, and nervous systems. Additionally, it stimulates the brain and improves the psycho-emotional state. In vivo, vitamin B<sub>1</sub> occurs in free form as thiamine or as its ester with phosphate residue(s), i.e., as mono-, di-, or triphosphate. It has been proven that supportive therapy with vitamin B<sub>1</sub> can not only provide neuroprotection but also has a positive effect on advanced neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, or Huntington's disease. This paper presents studies on the effect of free thiamine (T) and thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) on the activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), which is an enzyme considered to play an important role in the therapies for neurodegenerative diseases, especially Alzheimer's disease. The mechanisms of action of these compounds as potential inhibitors of AChE were evaluated using both experimental (enzymatic activity) as well as computational (molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations, and MM-GBSA calculations) methods. The results of the current study indicate a non-competitive type of enzyme inhibition, in contrast to the previously published works suggesting a competitive one."

The most common chronic conditions diagnosed in persons 60 years and older are type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and cognitive impairment. It was found that diabetes mellitus is a major risk for cognitive decline, dementia, Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), Huntington's disease (HD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and other neurodegenerative disorders. Different mechanisms of associations between these diseases and diabetes mellitus have been suggested. For example, it is postulated that an impaired intracellular insulin signaling pathway, together with hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia, may cause pathological changes, such as dysfunction of the mitochondria, oxidative stress inflammatory responses, etc. The association between diabetes mellitus and neurodegenerative diseases, as well as the mechanisms of these associations, needs further investigation. The aim of this review is to describe the associations between diabetes mellitus, especially type 1 (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus, and selected neurodegenerative diseases, i.e., Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

Ninety questions were posed to ChatGPT (Versions 4o, 4, and 3.5) and Gemini: four questions about clinical diagnosis, seven about genetic inheritance, estimable recurrence risks, and available tests, and four questions about patient management, each for six different neurogenetic rare disorders (Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia type 4 and type 7, Huntington Disease, Fragile X-associated Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome, Becker Muscular Dystrophy, and FacioScapuloHumeral Muscular Dystrophy). According to the results of this study, GPT chatbots demonstrated significantly better performance than Gemini. Nonetheless, all AI chatbots showed notable gaps in diagnostic accuracy and a concerning level of hallucinations. As expected, these tools can empower clinicians in assessing neurogenetic disorders, yet their effective use demands meticulous collaboration and oversight from both neurologists and geneticists."

    "abstract": "Lipid metabolism plays a critical role in maintaining cellular integrity, especially within the nervous system, where lipids support neuronal structure, function, and synaptic plasticity. However, this essential metabolic pathway is highly susceptible to oxidative stress, which can lead to lipid peroxidation, a damaging process induced by reactive oxygen species. Lipid peroxidation generates by-products that disrupt many cellular functions, with a strong impact on proteostasis. In this review, we explore the role of lipid oxidation in protein folding and its associated pathological implications, with a particular focus on findings in neurodegeneration from <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> studies, an animal model that remains underutilized. Additionally, we highlight the effectiveness of different methodologies applied in this nematode to deepen our understanding of this intricate process. In the nervous system of any animal, including mammals and invertebrates, lipid oxidation can disturb the delicate balance of cellular homeostasis, leading to oxidative stress, the build-up of toxic by-products, and protein misfolding, key factors in neurodegenerative diseases. This disruption contributes to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, or Huntington's disease. The findings from <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> studies offer valuable insights into these complex processes and highlight potential avenues for developing targeted therapies to mitigate neurodegenerative disease progression."

    "abstract": "One of the principal goals of Precision Medicine is to stratify patients by accounting for individual variability. However, extracting meaningful information from Real-World Data, such as Electronic Health Records, still remains challenging due to methodological and computational issues. A Dynamic Time Warping-based unsupervised-clustering methodology is presented in this paper for the clustering of patient trajectories of multi-modal health data on the basis of shared temporal characteristics. Building on an earlier methodology, a new dimension of time-varying clinical and imaging features is incorporated, through an adapted cost-minimization algorithm for clustering on different, possibly overlapping, feature subsets. The model disease chosen is Huntington's disease (HD), characterized by progressive neurodegeneration. From a wide range of examined user-defined parameters, four case examples are highlighted to demonstrate the identified temporal patterns in multi-modal HD trajectories and to study how these differ due to the combined effects of feature weights and granularity threshold. For each identified cluster, polynomial fits that describe the time behavior of the assessed features are provided for an informative comparison, together with their averaged values. The proposed data-mining methodology permits the stratification of distinct time patterns of multi-modal health data in individuals that share a diagnosis, by employing user-customized criteria beyond the current clinical practice. Overall, this work bears implications for better analysis of individual variability in disease progression, opening doors to personalized preventative, diagnostic and therapeutic strategies."

    "abstract": "The consequences of non-pathogenic huntingtin (HTT) reduction in the mature brain are of substantial importance as clinical trials for numerous HTT-lowering therapies are underway; many of which are non-selective in that they reduce both mutant and wild type protein variants. In this study, we injected CaMKII-promoted AAV-Cre directly into the hippocampus of adult HTT floxed mice to explore the role of wild-type huntingtin (wtHTT) in adult hippocampal pyramidal neurons and the broader implications of its loss. Our findings reveal that wtHTT depletion results in profound macroscopic morphological abnormalities in hippocampal structure, accompanied by significant reactive gliosis. At the synaptic level, we identified a marked reduction in presynaptic terminals 1-2 months following wtHTT loss; this was contrasted by an increased density of postsynaptic mushroom spines and larger amplitudes of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents, indicative of disrupted synaptic homeostasis. Furthermore, intrinsic neuronal excitability was significantly diminished in CA1 pyramidal neurons lacking wtHTT, and we observed a complete loss of NMDA receptor-dependent long-term potentiation. Unexpectedly, synapse density returned to control levels 6-8 months following wtHTT loss, despite the ongoing presence of macroscopic morphological abnormalities, altered anxiety-related behaviors and clear impairments in spatial learning and memory. Overall, these findings uncover a previously unrecognized role of wtHTT as a critical regulator of hippocampal function in the mature brain, and highlight the hippocampus as a potentially vulnerable region to the adverse effects of non-selective HTT reduction."

    "title": "The role of mitochondrial dysfunction in Huntington's disease: Implications for therapeutic targeting.",
    "abstract": "Huntington's disease (HD) is a progressive, autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive decline, motor dysfunction, and psychiatric disturbances. A common feature of neurodegenerative disorders is mitochondrial dysfunction, which affects the brain's sensitivity to oxidative damage and its high oxygen demand. This dysfunction may plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of Huntington's disease. HD is caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the huntingtin gene, which leads to the production of a toxic mutant huntingtin (mHTT) protein. This disruption in mitochondrial function compromises energy metabolism and increases oxidative stress, resulting in mitochondrial DNA abnormalities, impaired calcium homeostasis, and altered mitochondrial dynamics. These effects ultimately may contribute to neuronal dysfunction and cell death, underscoring the importance of targeting mitochondrial function in developing therapeutic strategies for HD. This review discusses the mechanistic role of mitochondrial dysfunction in Huntington's disease. Mitochondrial dysfunction is a crucial factor in HD, making mitochondrial-targeted therapies a promising approach for treatment. We explore therapies that address bioenergy deficits, antioxidants that reduce reactive oxygen species, calcium modulators that restore calcium homeostasis, and treatments that enhance mitochondrial dynamics to rejuvenate mitochondrial function. We also highlight innovative treatment approaches such as gene editing and stem cell therapy, which offer hope for more personalized strategies. In conclusion, understanding mitochondrial dysfunction in Huntington's disease may guide potential treatment strategies. Targeting this dysfunction may help to slow disease progression and enhance the quality of life for individuals affected by Huntington's disease."

The development of innovative strategies is imperative for the early detection of predictive biomarkers, enabling timely intervention and mitigating irreversible cellular damage. Lipidomics, a comprehensive analytical approach, has emerged as an indispensable tool for systematically characterizing lipid profiles and elucidating their role in disease pathology. A MedLine search was performed to identify studies that use lipidomics for the characterization of HD. Search terms included \"Huntington disease\"; \"lipidomics\"; \"biomarker discovery\"; \"NMR\"; and \"Mass spectrometry\". This review highlights the significance of lipidomics in HD diagnosis and treatment, exploring changes in brain lipids and their functions. Recent breakthroughs in analytical techniques, particularly mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy, have revolutionized brain lipidomics research, enabling researchers to gain deeper insights into the complex lipidome of the brain. A comprehensive understanding of the broad spectrum of lipidomics alterations in HD is vital for precise diagnostic evaluation and effective disease management. The integration of lipidomics with artificial intelligence and interdisciplinary collaboration holds promise for addressing the clinical variability of HD."

    "abstract": "Phosphodiesterase (PDE) enzymes regulate intracellular signaling pathways crucial for brain development and the pathophysiology of neurological disorders. Among the 11 PDE subtypes, PDE4 and PDE5 are particularly significant due to their regulation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) signaling, respectively, which are vital for learning, memory, and neuroprotection. This review synthesizes current evidence on the roles of PDE4 and PDE5 in neurological health and disease, focusing on their regulation of second messenger pathways and their implications for brain function. Elevated PDE4 activity impairs synaptic plasticity by reducing cAMP levels and protein kinase A (PKA) activity, contributing to cognitive decline, acute brain injuries, and neuropsychiatric conditions such as bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. Similarly, PDE5 dysregulation disrupts nitric oxide (NO) signaling and protein kinase G (PKG) pathways, which are involved in cerebrovascular homeostasis, recovery after ischemic events, and neurodegenerative processes in Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's diseases. PDE4 and PDE5 are promising therapeutic targets for neurological disorders. Pharmacological modulation of these enzymes offers potential to enhance cognitive function and mitigate pathological mechanisms underlying brain injuries, neurodegenerative diseases, and psychiatric disorders. Further research into the regulation of PDE4 and PDE5 will advance therapeutic strategies for these conditions."

This narrative review presents a comprehensive overview of their applications in this field, offering an updated perspective on their potential for early diagnosis, disease monitoring, and therapeutic evaluation. Emerging MRI modalities such as neuromelanin-sensitive imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging, magnetization transfer imaging, and relaxometry provide sensitive biomarkers that can detect early microstructural degeneration, iron deposition, and connectivity disruptions in key regions like the substantia nigra. These techniques enable earlier and more accurate differentiation of movement disorders, including Parkinson's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, multiple system atrophy, corticobasal degeneration, Lewy body and frontotemporal dementia, Huntington's disease, and dystonia. Furthermore, MRI provides objective metrics for tracking disease progression and assessing therapeutic efficacy, making it an indispensable tool in clinical trials. Despite these advances, the absence of standardized protocols limits their integration into routine clinical practice. Addressing this gap and incorporating these techniques more systematically could bring the field closer to leveraging advanced MRI for personalized treatment strategies, ultimately improving outcomes for individuals with movement disorders."

However, a main question relates to how well levels of biomarkers measured in CSF are correlated with those measured in peripheral fluids, such as blood or saliva. In this study, we quantified levels of four neurodegenerative disease-related proteins, neurofilament light (NfL), total tau (t-tau), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and YKL-40 in matched CSF, plasma and saliva samples from Huntingtin (HTT) gene-positive individuals (n = 21) using electrochemiluminescence assays. In addition, salivary levels of NfL, t-tau, and GFAP were quantified from a larger cohort (n = 95). We found both positive and negative correlations in the levels of these biomarkers among different biofluids. Most notably, in contrast to the significant positive correlations observed between CSF and plasma levels for NfL and GFAP, we detected significant negative correlations between the CSF and saliva levels of NfL and GFAP. With regard to clinical measures, both plasma and CSF levels of NfL were significantly positively correlated with Total Motor Score and chorea, whereas saliva levels of NfL showed significant correlations in the opposite direction. Additional correlations between salivary biomarkers with clinical data, adjusting for age, sex and CAG repeat length, confirmed that salivary NfL was significantly negatively associated with chorea scores in manifest HD, but not premanifest (PM), individuals. In contrast, salivary t-tau was positively associated with measures of cognition in PM participants. These findings suggest that salivary levels of NfL and t-tau proteins may exemplify non-invasive biomarkers for disease symptoms at different stages of illness. Further, these findings highlight the notion that different forms of disease proteins exist in different biological fluids."

This randomised pilot trial examined the feasibility of a large scale trial to assess efficacy of multidomain CCT in pre-manifest and early-stage HD. 28 participants were randomised to either at-home CCT (2 × 60 min sessions per week for 12 weeks; n = 13) or lifestyle education through monthly newsletters (n = 15). Participants completed cognitive tasks and questionnaires at baseline and follow up, either in person (n = 18) or via video teleconferencing (n = 10). All participants were retained at follow up, and adherence to CCT ranged from 96 to 100%, with 11/13 participants completing all sessions. Preliminary analyses showed evidence of a large effect of CCT on task switching and response inhibition, compared to lifestyle education. There was no evidence of specific benefit to other cognitive domains (processing speed, basic and divided attention, working memory), or psychosocial functions (subjective cognition, mood, health-related quality of life). Whilst retention and adherence rates were high, recruitment rates were low, suggesting that a large scale trial may be feasible with some modifications to increase recruitment rates, such as by reducing time burden associated with the study, and using a multi-site trial design. Potential effects on cognitive functioning warrant further investigation. The trial was prospectively registered on the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12622000908730)."

The first 17 amino acids of the N-terminus of Httex1 (N17 domain) immediately preceding the polyQ repeat domain are evolutionarily conserved across vertebrates and play multifaceted roles in the pathogenesis of HD. Due to its amphipathic helical properties, the N17 domain, both alone and when membrane-associated, promotes mHttEx1 aggregation. Diverse post-translational modifications (PTMs) in the N17 domain alter the aggregation state, thus modulating the cellular toxicity of mHttex1. Furthermore, the N17 domain serves as a nuclear export signal (NES) and mediates the cytoplasmic localization of mHttex1. This review summarizes the four main roles of the N17 domain in regulating HD pathology and discusses potential therapeutic approaches targeting this N17 domain to mitigate HD progression."

    "abstract": "Burn injuries are associated with high mortality and morbidity, especially in the elderly population. Although burns are preventable, they account for the fourth most common cause of trauma worldwide. The majority of the mortality associated with burn victims is also seen in the elderly age group. Most mortality predictor scores focus on age and total body surface area (TBSA) burned. However, data focusing specifically on elderly populations with respect to TBSA, particularly within the Appalachian region, remain limited. This rough terrain is accompanied by multiple challenges and health care disparities with limited burn care access. The population was a significant portion of the elderly who have multiple comorbidities; the majority of the population are economically struggling, living in rural communities, and the state of West Virginia (WV) is considered to have the highest drug use/addiction in the country. It is not shocking that they have the worst health outcomes in the nation. This study aims to evaluate the impact of TBSA burn on clinical outcomes and comorbidities in elderly burn patients within Appalachia. Cabell Huntington Hospital, the only burn intensive care unit (BICU) in WV, was investigated in this retrospective study. This cohort study analyzed data from 198 patients aged 65 and older admitted to the BICU between January 2017 and January 2023. Data included demographic variables, TBSA burned, comorbidities, and outcomes. Statistical analyses assessed relationships between TBSA and age, gender, length of hospital stay, discharge status, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), smoking history, diabetes mellitus (DM), BMI, and inhalation injury. Different statistical analyses were used to analyze the relationship between TBSA and the variables of interest. Our result section indicated that the majority of the elderly patients with burns were males (65%); however, there was no statistical difference between genders and TBSA (p=0.86). The group with higher TBSA was more likely to have COPD (p<0.0001), use home oxygen (p<0.0001), and have inhalation injury on presentation (p=0.002). Older age was associated with higher TBSA burn (p=0.003), with each one-year increase in age, TBSA burned in our population increased by 0.46% (p=0.002). The group with higher TBSA had higher mortality with a significance (p<0.0001). The annual mortality rate for burn victims above the age of 65 in the Appalachia sole BICU is 14 patients per 100. Our study was not able to find any significance for hospital duration, source of burn, presence of DM, or BMI with TBSA burned. This study in a unique population base will allow clinicians to understand the elderly burn victim in this underserved area of Appalachia, resource-limited and comorbidity-burdened population. This will allow for targeted interventions to improve outcomes in this vulnerable demographic."

Recent studies have included quercetin to impact the cellular and molecular pathways involved in neurodegeneration. Quercetin, a flavonoid abundant in vegetables and fruits, is gaining attention for its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiapoptotic properties. It regulates signaling pathways such as nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), sirtuins, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/Akt). These pathways are essential for cellular survival, inflammation regulation, and apoptosis.

This cohort study evaluates associations of Se levels with brain health in older American Indians. The Strong Heart Study is a longitudinal cohort of American Indians, with comprehensive medical assessments, including trace element exposure assessment. Urinary Se measurements, brain MRIs, and neuropsychological testing were available for 728 participants aged 65-95 at the time of brain MRI. We evaluated associations of urinary Se (divided by urinary creatinine to account for urine dilution) with MRI and neuropsychological tests and adjusted for potential confounders using linear regression models. Increased urinary Se was significantly associated with abnormal sulcal atrophy, ventricular widening, and increased white matter hyperintensity volume but not independent of sociodemographic factors and common vascular co-morbidities. Increased urinary Se was also significantly and independently associated with decreased performance in verbal fluency and processing speed, independent of sociodemographics, vascular co-morbidities, depression, and traumatic brain injury. These findings suggest urinary Se levels, particularly those above 50-60 μg Se/g creatinine, are associated with adverse structural brain findings on imaging and diminished cognitive health in older American Indians. This epidemiologic evidence may be useful for public health professionals in evaluating environmental risk, especially within the context of vulnerable populations and high Se intake."

Characterized by a decline in the ability to detect or identify odors, OD has been observed in various conditions, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). This phenomenon often precedes the onset of other clinical symptoms, suggesting its potential utility as an early marker or prodromal symptom of neurodegenerative diseases. This review provides a vast literature overview on the current knowledge of OD in PD, AD, ALS, and HD in order to evaluate its potential as a biomarker, particularly in the early and prodromal stages of these diseases. We summarize the most common methods used to measure olfactory function and delve into neuropathological correlations and the alterations in neurotransmitter systems associated with OD in those neurodegenerative diseases, including differences in genetic variants if applicable, and cater to current pitfalls and shortcomings in the research."

    "title": "Evaluating Use of Empagliflozin for Diabetes Management in Veterans With Chronic Kidney Disease.",
    "abstract": "About 1 in 4 veterans have diabetes, and many also have chronic kidney disease (CKD). Empagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitor, is approved for the treatment of diabetes. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of empagliflozin on hemoglobin A<sub>1c</sub> (HbA<sub>1c</sub>) in patients with CKD. A retrospective chart review evaluated patients that had a type 2 diabetes diagnosis and stage 3 CKD prescribed empagliflozin for diabetes management between January 1, 2015, and October 1, 2022. Patient demographics, medication, HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels, and other data were collected from a random sample of 100 patients from 1771 potential study subjects. There was no statistically significant difference in changes in HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels between those with stage 3 and stage 3b diabetes CKD who were taking empagliflozin (<i>P</i> = .51). Within each group, there were significant statistical differences in changes in HbA<sub>1c</sub> for patients with stage 3a (<i>P</i> < .05) and stage 3b (<i>P</i> = .02). Patients with stage 3a had a reduction in HbA<sub>1c</sub> of 0.65% and the stage 3b grow had a 0.48% reduction. There was a statistically significant weight change for patients in the stage 3a group (<i>P</i> < .05). Statistically significant differences were found in systolic (<i>P</i> = .003) and diastolic (<i>P</i> = .04) blood pressure for the stage 3a CKD group only. The most common adverse effects leading to discontinuation of empagliflozin were dizziness, increased incidence of urinary tract infections, and rash. Empagliflozin is a favorable option for reducing HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels in patients with diabetes and CKD."

    "abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Huntington's disease (HD) are diverse in clinical presentation and are caused by complex and multiple factors, including genetic mutations and environmental factors. Numerous therapeutic approaches have been developed based on the genetic causes and potential mechanisms of ALS and HD. Currently, available treatments for various neurodegenerative diseases can alleviate symptoms but do not provide a definitive cure. Gene therapy, which aims to modify or express specific proteins for neuroprotection or correction, is considered a powerful tool in managing neurodegenerative conditions. To date, antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) drugs targeting the pathological genes associated with ALS and HD have shown promising results in numerous animal studies and several clinical trials. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the development, mechanisms of action, limitations, and clinical applications of ASO drugs in neurodegenerative diseases, with a specific focus on ALS and HD therapeutic strategies."

    "abstract": "Huntingtin-associated protein 1 (HAP1) is an essential constituent of the stigmoid body (STB) and is known as a neuroprotective interactor with causal agents for several neurodegenerative disorders, including huntingtin (HTT) in Huntington's disease. Previous in vitro studies showed that compared to normal HTT, STB/HAP1 exhibited a higher binding affinity for mutant HTT. The detailed in vivo relationships of STB/HAP1 with endogenous HTT, however, have not been clarified yet. This study examined the distribution of endogenous HTT and its relationships with STB/HAP1 in the adult mouse brain and spinal cord using light/fluorescence microscopy. Our results show that HTT immunoreactivity is highly distributed in the striatum, medial septal nucleus (MS), nucleus of the horizontal limb/ vertical limb of the diagonal band of Broca (HDB, VDB), substantia innominata basal part (SIB), pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPTg), laterodorsal tegmental nucleus (LDTg), autonomic preganglionic neurons, and brainstem/spinal motoneurons. More than 90 % of HTT-immunoreactive (ir) neurons contain STB/HAP1 immunoreactivity in MS, VBD/HDB, SIB, PPTg, LDTg, and autonomic preganglionic nuclei. HTT-ir neurons in the striatal and motor nuclei, however, do not exhibit HAP1 immunoreactivity. These suggest that due to the absence of STB/HAP1-protectivity, HTT-ir striatal/motor neurons are more vulnerable to neurodegeneration than other HAP1-expressing HTT neurons. Our current findings might provide a framework for elucidating the pathophysiological functions of endogenous HTT and HAP1 in the central nervous system."

    "abstract": "Huntington disease (HD) is a genetic neurodegenerative disorder. Given the focus on motor manifestations, nonmotor symptoms are frequently underappreciated in clinical evaluations, despite frequently contributing to primary functional impairment. A diagnosis of motor-onset as the definition of manifest symptoms misrepresents the complex nature of HD presentation. Despite recent attempt to integrate nonmotor diagnostic criteria, practical guidelines are necessary to inform clinical diagnosis. We propose an HD diagnostic framework and staging system that prioritizes genetic testing, integrates motor and nonmotor symptom considerations in the determination of clinical disease onset and severity, and acknowledges the secondary role of clinically indicated diagnostic assessments, incorporating the broad symptom profiles observed in clinical practice. The proposed diagnostic criteria more accurately reflect the presentation of HD and provide greater opportunities for health care professionals to provide appropriate clinical care guidelines for adults with gene-expanded HD."

It presents as reddish-brown macules, papules, or plaques, typically located on the neck, face, and trunk. The etiology remains unknown, though it is believed to be reactive rather than malignant. CP can occasionally become systemic, affecting two or more extracutaneous organs. This report describes a 54-year-old Caucasian male patient with erythematous, scaly plaques on his lower back and arms. Histopathology revealed a dense polyclonal plasma cell infiltrate with a predominance of IgG4+ cells. The patient was treated with topical corticosteroids and referred for further systemic workup. This case emphasizes the importance of distinguishing CP from systemic plasmacytosis, which can mimic multiple myeloma, plasmacytoma, or Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, each requiring distinct management approaches."

Previous studies using human postmortem tissues have shown the impact of neurodegenerative disorders on adult neurogenesis. The extent to which adult neural stem cells are activated in the subventricular zone and whether therapeutic treatments such as deep brain stimulation promote adult neurogenesis remains unclear. The goal of the present study is to assess adult neural stem cells activation and neurogenesis in the subventricular zone of patients with Huntington's and Parkinson's diseases who were treated or not by deep brain stimulation. Postmortem brain samples from Huntington's and Parkinson's disease patients who had received or not long-term deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus were used. Our results indicate a significant increase in the thickness of the subventricular zone and in the density of proliferating cells and activated stem cells in the brain of Huntington's disease subjects and Parkinson's disease patients treated with deep brain stimulation. We also observed an increase in the density of immature neurons in the brain of these patients. Overall, our data indicate that long-term deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus promotes cell proliferation and neurogenesis in the subventricular zone that are reduced in Parkinson's disease. Taken together, our results also provide a detailed characterization of the cellular composition of the adult human subventricular zone and caudate nucleus in normal condition and in Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases and demonstrate the plasticity of these regions in response to neurodegeneration.

Examination revealed notable neurological abnormalities including impaired memory recall, oral dyskinesia/choreiform movements, dystonia of the right upper extremity with drift, hyper-reflexia and spastic gait. On further evaluation, including neurology and genetics consultation and workup, a clinical diagnosis of the neurodegenerative disorder Huntington's disease (HD) was made. Further history revealed a family history of cognitive issues and dystonia in his uncle at the age of mid-40s. The diagnosis of HD was confirmed via genetic testing of the blood, specifically looking for trinucleotide repeats. HD allele 1 had full penetrance with 44 cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) repeats and HD allele 2 had partial penetrance with 15 CAG repeats.

Although certain therapies may alleviate some of the physical and mental symptoms associated with neurodegenerative disorders, hence slowing their progression, but no sure-shot treatment is currently available. It was shown that the rise in life expectancy and the number of elderly people in the community led to an increasing trend in the incidence and prevalence of neurodegenerative disease. Phytomolecules are demonstrating their effectiveness in combating, regression, and delaying various diseases. Genistein is one of soy isoflavone with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and estrogenic effects. Researchers demonstrated that Genistein treatment significantly reduced hyperglycemia, improved cognitive performance by modulating acetylcholinesterase activity and oxidative stress, and alleviated neuroinflammatory conditions in mice. This paper evaluates (in vivo and in vitro) various molecular targets of isoflavones and their ability to effectively counter several neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and Huntington's diseases and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In this review, we aim to provide an overview of the role that genistein plays in delaying the development of neurodegenerative disorders."

    "abstract": "Huntington disease (HD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that causes psychiatric and neurological symptoms, including involuntary and irregular muscle movements (chorea). Chorea can disrupt activities of daily living, pose safety issues, and may lead to social withdrawal. The vesicular monoamine transporter 2 inhibitors tetrabenazine, deutetrabenazine, and valbenazine are approved treatments that can reduce chorea. This post hoc analysis was conducted to evaluate safety and efficacy among participants who received high-dosage deutetrabenazine treatment (> 48 mg/d) in ARC-HD, an open-label study that assessed long-term safety and efficacy of deutetrabenazine for the treatment of chorea in HD in adults. ARC-HD was a single-arm, two-cohort, open-label study. Participants either successfully completed the First-HD study or switched overnight from tetrabenazine to deutetrabenazine. Participants were dosed with deutetrabenazine in a response-driven manner (maximum 72 mg/d allowed). For the current analysis, exposure-adjusted incidence rates (EAIRs) for adverse events of interest were analyzed according to daily dosage (≤ 48 mg/d versus > 48 mg/d), and total maximal chorea (TMC) scores were analyzed by cohort during the stable-dose period. In total, 116 of the 119 participants enrolled in ARC-HD entered the stable-dose period, where no apparent differences were seen in EAIRs when receiving deutetrabenazine dosages ≤ 48 mg/d (exposure = 177.7 person-years) compared with > 48 mg/d (exposure = 74.1 person-years). Similar results were found among the subset of participants who received deutetrabenazine dosages > 48 mg/d at least once during the study (n = 49, 42%) when their dosage was ≤ 48 mg/d (exposure = 37.9 person-years) versus > 48 mg/d (74.1 person-years). Efficacy analyses were conducted for participants who had TMC scores available (rollover cohort, n = 77; switch cohort, n = 35). For most participants, the lowest deutetrabenazine dosage needed to achieve a TMC response (≥ 30% improvement from baseline) was between 24 and 48 mg/d in both the rollover (n = 57, 74.0%) and switch (n = 16, 46.0%) cohorts. Whereas the dosage needed for a TMC response was independent of baseline TMC score in the rollover cohort, participants with higher baseline TMC scores in the switch cohort required higher dosages to achieve a TMC response during the trial. In this open-label, long-term study, some participants received deutetrabenazine dosing > 48 mg/d to achieve adequate chorea control. There was no new safety concern or incremental change in the safety profile between dosages of ≤ 48 mg/d and > 48 mg/d. These results include dosages that have not been approved for clinical use, however, they increase our understanding of safety and tolerability of deutetrabenazine doses.

    "abstract": "Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease with the age at which characteristic symptoms manifest strongly influenced by inherited HTT CAG length. Somatic CAG expansion occurs throughout life and understanding the impact of somatic expansion on neurodegeneration is key to developing therapeutic targets. In 57 HD gene expanded (HDGE) individuals, ~23 years before their predicted clinical motor diagnosis, no significant decline in clinical, cognitive or neuropsychiatric function was observed over 4.5 years compared with 46 controls (false discovery rate (FDR) > 0.3). However, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers showed very early signs of neurodegeneration in HDGE with elevated neurofilament light (NfL) protein, an indicator of neuroaxonal damage (FDR = 3.2 × 10<sup>-12</sup>), and reduced proenkephalin (PENK), a surrogate marker for the state of striatal medium spiny neurons (FDR = 2.6 × 10<sup>-3</sup>), accompanied by brain atrophy, predominantly in the caudate (FDR = 5.5 × 10<sup>-10</sup>) and putamen (FDR = 1.2 × 10<sup>-9</sup>). Longitudinal increase in somatic CAG repeat expansion ratio (SER) in blood was a significant predictor of subsequent caudate (FDR = 0.072) and putamen (FDR = 0.148) atrophy. Atypical loss of interruption HTT repeat structures, known to predict earlier age at clinical motor diagnosis, was associated with substantially faster caudate and putamen atrophy. We provide evidence in living humans that the influence of CAG length on HD neuropathology is mediated by somatic CAG repeat expansion. These critical mechanistic insights into the earliest neurodegenerative changes will inform the design of preventative clinical trials aimed at modulating somatic expansion.

    "abstract": "Toxic protein aggregates are associated with various neurodegenerative diseases, including Huntington's disease (HD). Since no current treatment delays the progression of HD, we develop a mechanistic approach to prevent mutant huntingtin (mHttex1) aggregation. Here, we engineer the ATP-independent cytosolic chaperone PEX19, which targets peroxisomal membrane proteins to peroxisomes, to remove mHttex1 aggregates. Using yeast toxicity-based screening with a random mutant library, we identify two yeast PEX19 variants and engineer equivalent mutations into human PEX19 (hsPEX19). These variants effectively delay mHttex1 aggregation in vitro and in cellular HD models. The mutated hydrophobic residue in the α4 helix of hsPEX19 variants binds to the N17 domain of mHttex1, thereby inhibiting the initial aggregation process. Overexpression of the hsPEX19-FV variant rescues HD-associated phenotypes in primary striatal neurons and in Drosophila. Overall, our data reveal that engineering ATP-independent membrane protein chaperones is a promising therapeutic approach for rational targeting of mHttex1 aggregation in HD."

Despite various treatment strategies aimed at alleviating symptoms, treatments remain elusive and ineffective due to the disease's complexity. However, recent advancements in gene therapy via the CRISPR-Cas system offer ground-breaking and targeted treatment options. Based on a bacterial immune mechanism, the CRISPR-Cas system enables precise genome editing, allowing for the alteration of different genetic mutations and the possible cure of genetic diseases. In the context of neurological disorders, the CRISPR-Cas system shows a promising avenue by allowing researchers to conduct genome-editing which is implicated in neurodegenerative disease therapeutics. This book chapter provides an updated overview of the application of the CRISPR-Cas system for addressing target-specific therapeutic approaches for neurodegenerative disorders. Furthermore, we discuss the principles of the CRISPR-Cas mechanism, its role in modeling neurological disorders, identifying molecular targets, and developing gene-based therapies. Additionally, the chapter explores the recent clinical trials and CRISPR-Cas-mediated treatments for neurological conditions. By leveraging the accuracy and versatility of the CRISPR-Cas system, scientists can more effectively handle the genetic underpinnings of neurodegenerative diseases. Furthermore, the chapter extends the critical viewpoints on ethical considerations and technical limitations related to the clinical deployment of this revolutionizing technique."

    "abstract": "In Huntington's disease (HD), striatal projection neurons (SPNs) degenerate during midlife; the core biological question involves how the disease-causing DNA repeat (CAG)<sub>n</sub> in the huntingtin (HTT) gene leads to neurodegeneration after decades of biological latency. We developed a single-cell method for measuring this repeat's length alongside genome-wide RNA expression. We found that the HTT CAG repeat expands somatically from 40-45 to 100-500+ CAGs in SPNs. Somatic expansion from 40 to 150 CAGs had no apparent cell-autonomous effect, but SPNs with 150-500+ CAGs lost positive and then negative features of neuronal identity, de-repressed senescence/apoptosis genes, and were lost. Our results suggest that somatic repeat expansion beyond 150 CAGs causes SPNs to degenerate quickly and asynchronously. We conclude that in HD, at any one time, most neurons have an innocuous but unstable HTT gene and that HD pathogenesis is a DNA process for almost all of a neuron's life."

    "abstract": "The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a highly selective, semipermeable barrier critical for maintaining brain homeostasis. The BBB regulates the transport of essential nutrients, hormones, and signaling molecules between the bloodstream and the central nervous system (CNS), while simultaneously protecting the brain from potentially harmful substances and pathogens. This selective permeability ensures that the brain is nourished and shielded from toxins. An exception to this are brain regions, such as the hypothalamus and circumventricular organs, which are irrigated by fenestrated capillaries, allowing rapid and direct response to various blood components. We overview the metabolic functions of the BBB, with an emphasis on the impact of altered glucose metabolism and insulin signaling on BBB in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Notably, endothelial cells constituting the BBB exhibit distinct metabolic characteristics, primarily generating ATP through aerobic glycolysis. This occurs despite their direct exposure to the abundant oxygen in the bloodstream, which typically supports oxidative phosphorylation. The effects of insulin on astrocytes, which form the glial limitans component of the BBB, show a marked sexual dimorphism. BBB nutrient sensing in the hypothalamus, along with insulin signaling, regulates systemic metabolism. Insulin modifies BBB permeability by regulating the expression of tight junction proteins, angiogenesis, and vascular remodeling, as well as modulating blood flow in the brain. The disruptions in glucose and insulin signaling are particularly evident in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, where BBB breakdown accelerates cognitive decline. This review highlights the critical role of normal glucose metabolism and insulin signaling in maintaining BBB functionality and investigates how disruptions in these pathways contribute to the onset and progression of neurodegenerative diseases."

Tube feeding is associated with co-morbidities, and provides limited benefits. Non-human models of HD have been utilized to study diets and supplements. Application of findings from these models to humans has not been shown to be of comparable benefit. While studies of nutritional factors in non-human models of HD have shown some promising results, trials in humans have found little efficacy for diets or supplements.

HD is well linked to mutation in the HTT gene, which leads to an abnormal expansion of trinucleotide CAG repeats, resulting in the production of the mHTT protein and responsible for abnormally long poly-Q tract. These abnormal proteins disrupt cellular processes, including neuroinflammation, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction, ultimately leading to selective neuronal loss in the brain. Epidemiological studies reveal significant regional variability in HDs prevalence, with the highest rates observed in North America and the lowest in Africa. In addition to genetic factors, environmental influences such as exposure to metals, and chemicals, and lifestyle factors like alcohol and tobacco use may exacerbate disease progression. This review explores the molecular mechanisms underlying HDs and emphasize the role of neuroinflammatory mediators and environmental factors, in HD research. Understanding these complex interactions is crucial for developing targeted interventions that can slow or halt the progression of this devastating disease."

Fifty-seven speakers with dysarthria and 30 controls produced the sentence \"Buy Kaia a kite\" five times. A three-dimensional electromagnetic articulography was used to record the articulatory movements of the posterior tongue and jaw. Sentence-length kinematic measures (e.g., duration, tongue range of motion [ROM], jaw ROM, tongue speed, jaw speed) were extracted. Results revealed significant group effects for the duration, jaw ROM, and tongue speed but not for tongue ROM. Post hoc pairwise comparisons revealed more significant between-groups differences for duration and jaw ROM than for tongue speed. Statistically significant findings between clinical groups were predominantly driven by the difference between speakers with PD and speakers of other clinical groups. Reduced jaw ROM and trends toward reduced tongue ROM confirm hypokinesia as a distinguishing motor feature of speakers with PD. However, deviancies in speed or movement duration did not emerge as a distinguishing motor feature for any of the four studied clinical groups. Nevertheless, movement duration, but not movement speed, may be useful to index dysarthria severity."

Multiple significant changes were observed in non-motor areas (cognition, speech, sleep, mood, fatigue, pain; p < 0.05) and functional impacts (mobility, effort to do usual activities, personal comfort; p < 0.05). Thematic analysis revealed ability to cope with and compensate for actual or anticipated symptoms reduced disruptions to well-being and changed how bothersome symptoms were. All digital measures targeted symptoms that were personally important to most participants (> 80%). Non-motor and walking/balance symptoms changed sooner than other motor symptoms during the course of 1 year. Evaluation of coping and compensatory mechanisms may be essential to understanding symptom bothersomeness at a given point in time. Smartphone and smartwatch digital measures were relevant to personally meaningful symptoms of early PD."

    "title": "Total functioning capacity scale in Huntington's disease: natural course over time.",
    "abstract": "The total functioning capacity (TFC) assessment has been integral to Huntington's disease (HD) research and clinical trials, measuring disease stage and progression. This study investigates the natural progression of function in HD, focusing on changes in TFC scores related to age and CAG-repeat length, and evaluates TFC's strengths and weaknesses in longitudinal studies. Using Enroll-HD platform's clinical dataset version 5, including Registry-3, we analysed data from 21,079 participants, with 16,083 having an expanded CAG repeat. Our final analysis encompassed 15,527 patients and 52,457 visits, with TFC scores ranging from 0 to 13. Alluvial charts show that most individuals maintain maximum functional capacity over time. 3505 individuals experienced change in TFC scores, over the subsequent 4 years, 2224 (64.1%) experienced declining TFC scores, while 661 (18.6%) showed improvement within a year. The remaining 17.3% exhibited stable TFC scores. Age-related changes followed a specific sequence: occupation, household chores/finances, daily living, and care. Longer CAG-repeat lengths were linked to earlier functional decline, with some geographic regions showing earlier losses in specific domains. Reduced penetrance CAG-repeat groups exhibited different trajectories from full penetrance HD participants. When we focus on those who experienced a change in TFC score, the number of HD patients with regained functional capacity is substantial, even considering interrater variability, which may influence outcome assessments in clinical trials. The TFC effectively reflects changes in functional domains as intended. Analysis of the reduced penetrance group suggests potential selection biases in seeking medical attention earlier and for reasons unrelated to HD."

    "title": "In Vivo Nanodiamond Quantum Sensing of Free Radicals in Caenorhabditis elegans Models.",
    "abstract": "Free radicals are believed to play a secondary role in the cell death cascade associated with various diseases. In Huntington's disease (HD), the aggregation of polyglutamine (PolyQ) not only contributes to the disease but also elevates free radical levels. However, measuring free radicals is difficult due to their short lifespan and limited diffusion range. Here, a quantum sensing technique (T1 relaxometry) is used that involves fluorescent nanodiamonds (FND). Nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers within these nanodiamonds change their optical properties in response to magnetic noise, which allows detecting the unpaired electron from free radicals. This method is used to monitor the production of free radicals inside Caenorhabditis elegans models of Huntington's disease in vivo and in real-time. To investigate if radical generation occurs near polyglutamine expansions, a strain expressing Q40 yellow fluorescent protein (Q40::YFP, polyglutamine expansion overexpressed in the muscle) is used. By applying T1 relaxometry on FNDs in the body wall muscle, it is found that the production of free radicals significantly increase when PolyQ is expressed there (compared to the FNDs in intestine). The technique demonstrates the submicrometer localization of free radical information in living animals and direct measurement of their level, which may reveal the relation between oxidative stress and Huntington's disease."

    "abstract": "Neurodisease, caused by undesired substances, can lead to mental health conditions like depression, anxiety and neurocognitive problems like dementia. These substances can be referred to as contaminants that can cause damage, corruption, and infection or reduce brain functionality. Contaminants, whether conceptual or physical, have the ability to disrupt many processes. These observations motivate us to investigate contaminants and neurotoxicity collaboratively. This study investigates the link between pollutants and neuro-disease, examining transmission pathways and categorization. It also provides information on resources, causes, and challenges to minimize contamination risks. Contamination may cause various neuro-diseases, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, multi-system atrophy, Huntington's, autism spectrum disorder, psychiatric disorder, dementia, meningitis, encephalitis, schizophrenia, anxiety, and depression. The negative effects depend on the nature and extent of exposure. A comprehensive literature search was conducted using databases such as PubMed and Scopus, focusing on studies published till 2024. Studies were selected based on their examination of the relationship between environmental contaminants and brain health, emphasizing transmission pathways and the resulting neurological outcomes. Findings indicate that contaminants can penetrate the blood-brain barrier (BBB) via nasal, gut, and auditory routes, triggering harmful neurophysiological processes. This review highlights the urgent need for increased global awareness, policy interventions, and preventive measures to mitigate the long-term impacts of environmental contaminants on brain health, particularly in emerging nations."

    "title": "Bioinformatics Analysis Reveals Microrchidia Family Genes as the Prognostic and Therapeutic Markers for Colorectal Cancer.",
    "abstract": "The aim of this study is to examine the role of the microrchidia (MORC) family, a group of chromatin remodeling proteins, as the therapeutic and prognostic markers for colorectal cancer (CRC). MORC protein family genes are a highly conserved nucleoprotein superfamily whose members share a common domain but have distinct biological functions. Previous studies have analyzed the roles of MORCs as epigenetic regulators and chromatin remodulators; however, the involvement of MORCs in the development and pathogenesis of CRC was less examined. The current work examined the role of the MORCs as the therapeutic and prognostic markers for CRC. The expressions and prognostic significance of MORC family genes in CRC were explored. The role of these genes in tumor immunity was comprehensively analyzed in terms of their functions in immune cell infiltration, tumor microenvironment (TME), and their interaction with immune regulatory genes such as immunosuppressive genes, immune checkpoints and immunostimulatory genes. The relations between MORC family genes, tumor mutation burden (TMB), DNA, mismatch repair (MMR), RNA methylation, microsatellite instability (MSI), and drug sensitivity were investigated using the R statistical software. The expressions of MORC4 in 150 CRC tissues and 60 paracancer tissues were detected by immunohistochemical method. CRC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion were measured by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8), scratch assay, and transwell cell invasion assay. The expressions of MORC2 and MORC4 were significantly upregulated, whereas those of MORC1 and MORC3 were noticeably downregulated in CRC in comparison to their expressions in normal colorectal mucosal tissues. Patients with high-expressed MORC2 showed a more unfavorable prognosis than those with a low MORC2 level. Functional annotation analysis identified 100 MORC family genes with the most significant negative or positive correlations to diabetic cardiomyopathy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, oxidative phosphorylation, Huntington's disease, thermogenesis, Parkinson's disease, olfactory transduction, Alzheimer's disease, prion disease. MORC3 expression was positively correlated with Stromal score, Immune score and ESTIMATE score, while MORC2 expression was negatively related to the three scores in CRC, these correlations were not statistically significant. Additionally, the MORC family genes were significantly positively correlated with tumor-infiltrating immune cells such as T helper cells and exhibited close relations to some immunosuppressive genes such as CXCR4 and PVR, immunostimulatory genes such as TGFBR1, KDR, and CD160 as well as some immune checkpoint genes. It was found that the expressions of some members of MORC family genes were positively correlated with DNA methylation, MSI, TMB, MMRs, and drug sensitivity in CRC and that the mRNA and protein levels of MORC4 were remarkably upregulated in CRC tissues than in adjacent normal tissues (P<0.05). In the MORC4 knockdown group, DLD-1 cell proliferation was more inhibited than in the negative control (NC) and siRNA groups (P<0.05). Furthermore, the migratory capacity of DLD-1 cells and the number of cells crossing the basement membrane in the MORC4 knockdown group were reduced compared to the NC and siRNA groups (all P<0.05). The expressions of MORC family genes were significantly different in CRC samples, which was related to the immune cell infiltration and prognosis of CRC. Thus, the MORC family genes were considered as markers for indicating the clinical immunotherapy and prognostic outcome of CRC."

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial dysfunction is a hallmark of idiopathic neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer disease and Huntington disease. Familial forms of Parkinson disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis are often characterized by mutations in genes associated with mitophagy deficits. Therefore, enhancing the mitophagy pathway may represent a novel therapeutic approach to targeting an underlying pathogenic cause of neurodegenerative diseases, with the potential to deliver neuroprotection and disease modification, which is an important unmet need. Accumulating genetic, molecular and preclinical model-based evidence now supports targeting mitophagy in neurodegenerative diseases. Despite clinical development challenges, small-molecule-based approaches for selective mitophagy enhancement - namely, USP30 inhibitors and PINK1 activators - are entering phase I clinical trials for the first time."

    "abstract": "Biomolecular condensation lays the foundation of forming biologically important membraneless organelles, but abnormal condensation processes are often associated with human diseases. Ribonucleic acid (RNA) plays a critical role in the formation of biomolecular condensates by mediating the phase transition through its interactions with proteins and other RNAs. However, the physicochemical principles governing RNA phase transitions, especially for short RNAs, remain inadequately understood. Here, we report that small CAG repeat (sCAG) RNAs composed of six to seven CAG repeats, which are pathogenic factors in Huntington's disease, undergo phase transition <i>in vitro</i> and in cells. Leveraging solution nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and advanced coarse-grained molecular dynamic simulations, we reveal that sCAG RNAs form duplex structures with 3'-sticky ends, where the GC stickers initiate intermolecular crosslinking and promote the formation of RNA condensates. Furthermore, we demonstrate that sCAG RNAs can form cellular condensates within nuclear speckles. Our work suggests that the RNA phase transition can be promoted by specific structural motifs, reducing the reliance on sequence length and multivalence. This opens avenues for exploring new functions of RNA in biomolecular condensates and designing novel biomaterials based on RNA condensation."

Recent omics-driven research has revealed associations between vascular abnormalities and transcriptomic alterations in brain vascular cells, particularly endothelial cells (ECs) and pericytes (PCs). However, the impact of these molecular changes on dementia remains unclear. We conducted a comparative analysis of gene expression in ECs and PCs across neurodegenerative conditions, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Huntington's disease, and arteriovenous malformation, utilizing transcriptomic data from published postmortem human tissue studies. We identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) consistently dysregulated in ECs and PCs across these pathologies. Notably, several DEGs are linked to vascular cell zonation and genetic risks for AD and cerebral small vessel disease. Our findings provide insights into the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying vascular dysfunction in dementia, highlight the knowledge gaps, and suggest potential novel vascular therapeutic targets, including genes not previously investigated in this context. Systematic review of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in vascular cells from neurodegenerative single-nuclear RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) studies.

We detail SNUH-DBB operations, including protocols for specimen handling, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) and cerebral organoids establishment from postmortem dural fibroblasts, and adult neural progenitor cell cultures. We assessed clinical-neuropathological diagnostic concordance rate. Between 2015 and September 2024, 162 brain specimens were collected via brain donation and autopsy. The median donor age was 73 years (1-94) with a male-to -female ratio of 2:1. The median postmortem interval was 9.5 hours (range: 2.5-65). Common neuropathological diagnoses included pure Lewy body disease (10.6%), Lewy body disease (LBD) with other brain diseases (10.6%), pure Alzheimer's disease-neuropathological change (ADNC) (6.0%), ADNC with other brain diseases (10.7%), vascular brain injury (15.2%), and primary age-related tauopathy (7.3%).

Silencing the expression of mutated proteins is a therapeutic direction to rescue HD patients, and recent advances in gene editing technology such as CRISPR/CasRx have opened up new avenues for therapeutic intervention. The CRISPR/CasRx system was employed to target human HTT exon 1, resulting in an efficient knockdown of HTT mRNA. This therapeutic effect was substantiated in various models: HEK 293 T cell, the HD 140Q-KI mouse, and the HD-KI pig model. The efficiency of the knockdown was analyzed through Western blot and RT-qPCR. Additionally, neuropathological changes were examined using Western blot, immunostaining, and RNA sequencing. The impact on motor abilities was assessed via behavioral experiments, providing a comprehensive evaluation of the treatment's effectiveness. CRISPR/CasRx system can significantly reduce HTT mRNA levels across various models, including HEK 293 T cells, HD 140Q-KI mice at various disease stages, and HD-KI pigs, and resulted in decreased expression of mHTT. Utilizing the CRISPR/CasRx system to knock down HTT RNA has shown to ameliorate gliosis in HD 140Q-KI mice and delay neurodegeneration in HD pigs. These findings highlight the effectiveness of the RNA-targeting CRISPR/CasRx as a potential therapeutic strategy for HD. Furthermore, the success of this approach provides valuable insights and novel avenues for the treatment of other genetic disorders caused by gene mutations."

However, there is still a lack of comprehensive reviews that systematically summarize the impact of mitochondrial oxidative stress on neurodegenerative diseases. This review aims to address this gap by summarizing the molecular mechanisms by which mitochondrial oxidative stress promotes the initiation and progression of neurodegenerative disorders. Furthermore, it discusses the potential of antioxidant-based therapeutic strategies for the treatment of these diseases. By shedding light on the role of mitochondrial oxidative stress in neurodegenerative diseases, this review not only serves as a valuable reference for further research on the disease mechanisms, but also offers novel perspectives for the treatment of these disorders."

    "abstract": "Brain energy deficiency occurs at the early stage of Huntington disease (HD). Triheptanoin, a drug that targets the Krebs cycle, can restore a normal brain energetic profile in patients with HD. In this study, we aimed at assessing its efficacy on clinical and neuroimaging structural measures in HD. We conducted a 6-month bicentric (Paris, Leiden) double-blind randomized controlled trial followed by a 6-month open-label phase, between June 2015 and December 2019. We enrolled 107 patients at the early stage of HD-total motor score (TMS) of the UHDRS between 5 and 40. Participants received triheptanoin 1 g/kg/day or placebo (ratio 1/1). The primary outcome was the rate of caudate atrophy at 6 months using the caudate boundary shift integral (cBSI) method. Main secondary outcomes were cBSI at 12 months, TMS, and diffusion imaging at 6 and 12 months. Analysis was conducted using ANOVA, and data were presented with a 95% CI. To perform a 12-month comparison, we used the placebo arm of a 12-month randomized controlled trial conducted in parallel, using the double robust propensity score method. One hundred patients were randomized (mean age 49 years, 52% women). Fourteen patients withdrew from the study, including 10 because of gastrointestinal effects. There was no difference in cBSI at 6 months between groups (mean 0.026 [0.018-0.033] vs 0.023 [0.014-0.032]). TMS at 12 months was stable in patients treated with triheptanoin for 12 months (mean 0.6 [-1.1 to 2.1]), whereas it increased in patients initially on placebo (2.5 [1.2-3.8]). Compared with the external placebo control group, caudate atrophy decreased by approximately 50% (0.038 [0.028-0.048] vs 0.070 [0.057-0.082]) and TMS stabilized (0.66 [-1.07 to 2.48] vs 2.65 [1.38-3.89]) in patients treated with triheptanoin for 12 months. There was no effect of triheptanoin on caudate atrophy over 6 months. Compared with the external placebo group, triheptanoin was associated with motor stability and decreased caudate atrophy in patients treated for 12 months, but the post hoc nature of these findings is a major limitation. clinicaltrials.gov NCT02453061, May 25, 2015. First patient enrolled on June 29, 2015. This study provides Class I evidence that triheptanoin does not slow caudate atrophy compared with placebo over 6 months in patients with early HD."

Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCPRC) develop resistance becomes refractory to therapy limiting patient overall survival. Darolutamide is a novel next-generation androgen receptor-signaling inhibitor that is FDA approved for non-metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC). Imipridone ONC201/TIC10 is first-in-class small molecule imipridone that activates the integrated stress response (ISR), upregulates TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and has activity against CRPC alone or in combination with enzalutamide in preclinical models. We hypothesized that combination of imipridones with androgen receptor signaling blockers such as darolutamide may synergize in anti-tumor efficacy against mCRPC cells. mCRPC cell lines 22RV1, LNCaP, DU145 and PC3 were treated with imipridones ONC201, ONC206, apalutamide, darolutamide, or enzalutamide as single agents or in combinations. Combinations of ONC201 or ONC206 and androgen receptor signaling blockers demonstrated synergistic effects in mCRPC cells. Combinations of ONC201 and darolutamide or enzalutamide reduced PSA levels in LNCaP cells and induced of ATF4 in both LNCaP and 22RV1 cell lines. Darolutamide synergized with ONC201 regardless of AR status or castration sensitivity <i>in vitro</i>. Flow cytometric analysis showed increased intra-tumoral NK cells in mice treated with ONC201 and combination of ONC201 and darolutamide. Trends of increased TRAIL activation within NK cells were also observed in treatment groups. ONC201 and darolutamide demonstrated anti-tumor effects <i>in vivo</i> in the 22RV1 CRPC model.

    "abstract": "Huntington's disease is caused by a CAG repeat in the <i>HTT</i> gene. Repeat length correlates inversely with the age of onset but only explains part of the observed clinical variability. Genome-wide association studies highlight DNA repair genes in modifying disease onset, but further research is required to identify causal genes and evaluate their tractability as drug targets. To address these gaps and learn important preclinical information, we analysed genome-wide association study data from a large Huntington's disease age-of-onset study (<i>n</i> = 9064), prioritizing robust candidate Huntington's disease modifier genes using bioinformatic approaches and analysing related information for these genes from large-scale human genetic repositories. We supplemented this information with other Huntington's disease-related screens, including exome studies of Huntington's disease onset and high-throughput assessments of mHTT toxicity. To confirm whether Huntington's disease modifiers are shared across repeat expansion disorders, we also analysed age-of-onset genome-wide association study data from X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism caused by a (CCCTCT)<sub>n</sub> expansion. We also studied modifier-related associations with rare diseases to inform potential off-target therapeutic effects and conducted comprehensive phenome-wide studies to identify other traits linked to these genes. Finally, we evaluated the aggregated human genetic evidence and theoretical druggability of the prioritized Huntington's disease modifier genes, including characteristics recently associated with clinical trial stoppage due to safety concerns (i.e. human genetic constraint, number of interacting partners and RNA tissue expression specificity). In total, we annotated and assessed nine robust candidate Huntington's disease modifier genes. Notably, we detected a high correlation (<i>R</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0.78) in top age-of-onset genome-wide association study hits across repeat expansion disorders, emphasizing cross-disorder relevance. Clinical genetic repositories analysis showed DNA repair genes, such as <i>MLH1</i>, <i>PMS2</i> and <i>MSH3</i>, are associated with cancer phenotypes, suggesting potential limitations as drug targets. <i>LIG1</i> and <i>RRM2B</i> were both associated with neurofibrillary tangles, which may provide a link to a potential role in mHTT aggregates, while <i>MSH3</i> was associated with several cortical morphology-related traits relevant to Huntington's disease. Finally, human genetic evidence and theoretical druggability analyses prioritized and ranked modifier genes, with <i>PMS1</i> exhibiting the most favourable profile. Notably, <i>HTT</i> itself ranked poorly as a theoretical drug target, emphasizing the importance of exploring modifier-based alternative targets. In conclusion, our study highlights the importance of human genomic information to prioritize Huntington's disease modifier genes as drug targets, providing a basis for future therapeutic development in Huntington's disease and other repeat expansion disorders."

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases are significant health concerns that have a profound impact on the quality and duration of life for millions of individuals. These diseases are characterized by pathological changes in various brain regions, specific genetic mutations associated with the disease, deposits of abnormal proteins, and the degeneration of neurological cells. As neurodegenerative disorders vary in their epidemiological characteristics and vulnerability of neurons, treatment of these diseases is usually aimed at slowing disease progression. The heterogeneity of genetic and environmental factors involved in the process of neurodegeneration makes current treatment methods inadequate. However, the existence of common molecular mechanisms in the pathogenesis of these diseases may allow the development of new targeted therapeutic strategies. Oxidative and nitrosative stress damages membrane components by accumulating ROS and RNS and disrupting redox balance. This process results in the induction of apoptosis, which is important in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases through oxidative stress. Studies conducted using postmortem human samples, animal models, and cell cultures have demonstrated that oxidative stress, nitrosative stress, and apoptosis are crucial factors in the development of diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Multiple Sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Huntington's disease. The excessive production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, elevated levels of free radicals, heightened mitochondrial stress, disturbances in energy metabolism, and the oxidation and nitrosylation of cellular macromolecules are recognized as triggers for neuronal cell death. Challenges in managing and treating neurodegenerative diseases require a better understanding of this field at the molecular level. Therefore, this review elaborates on the molecular mechanisms by which oxidative and nitrosative stress are involved in neuronal apoptosis."

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases are a group of diseases that pose a serious threat to human health, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD) and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). In recent years, it has been found that mitochondrial remodeling plays an important role in the onset and progression of neurodegenerative diseases. Mitochondrial remodeling refers to the dynamic regulatory process of mitochondrial morphology, number and function, which can affect neuronal cell function and survival by regulating mechanisms such as mitochondrial fusion, division, clearance and biosynthesis. Mitochondrial dysfunction is an important intrinsic cause of the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Mitochondrial remodeling abnormalities are involved in energy metabolism in neurodegenerative diseases. Pathological changes in mitochondrial function and morphology, as well as interactions with other organelles, can affect the energy metabolism of dopaminergic neurons and participate in the development of neurodegenerative diseases. Since the number of patients with PD and AD has been increasing year by year in recent years, it is extremely important to take effective interventions to significantly reduce the number of morbidities and to improve people's quality of life. More and more researchers have suggested that mitochondrial remodeling and related dynamics may positively affect neurodegenerative diseases in terms of neuronal and self-adaptation to the surrounding environment. Mitochondrial remodeling mainly involves its own fission and fusion, energy metabolism, changes in channels, mitophagy, and interactions with other cellular organelles. This review will provide a systematic summary of the role of mitochondrial remodeling in neurodegenerative diseases, with the aim of providing new ideas and strategies for further research on the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases."

We examined the effects of four tACS frequencies (20 Hz, 40 Hz, 60 Hz, and 80 Hz) on motor cortex (M1) excitability and motor performance. In a randomised crossover design, 12 adults received 20-minute tACS sessions, with Sham as control. Corticomotor and intracortical excitability was measured up to 60-minutes post-tACS. Motor performance was evaluated using the Grooved Pegboard Test (GPT) and sensorimotor assessments. Our findings demonstrated frequency-dependent modulation of corticomotor excitability based on MEP amplitude. 20 Hz and 40 Hz tACS reduced MEPs, while 60 Hz and 80 Hz increased MEPs. Inhibition (cortical silent period, SP) was reduced across all tACS frequencies compared to Sham, with 20 Hz and 40 Hz showing consistent reductions, 60 Hz showing effects at post-0 and post-30, and 80 Hz at post-60. Furthermore, 60 Hz tACS decreased intracortical inhibition at post-0, while intracortical facilitation increased with 20 Hz and 60 Hz at post-0, and 40 Hz at post-60. Motor performance remained unaffected across frequencies. Regression analyses revealed that shorter SP at 60 min post 60 Hz tACS predicted faster reaction times, while greater MEP amplitudes at 60 min following 80 Hz tACS predicted improved hand dexterity. Overall, beta and gamma tACS frequencies modulate M1 excitability, with consistent effects on SP, suggesting potential use in conditions involving SP elongation, such as stroke and Huntington's disease. These findings highlight 60 Hz tACS as a potential tool for motor rehabilitation therapies."

Hand dexterity and strength in the dominant and non-dominant hand were assessed with the Nine Hole Peg Test, Ten Neurotest, Nut and Bolt Test, dynamometry, and Late-Life FDI. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) models were performed to investigate differences in hand function between manifest-HD, premanifest-HD, and controls. <b>Results:</b> Manifest-HD patients had significantly worse performance in manual and finger dexterity, fine-motor coordination, and poorer handgrip strength than premanifest-HD and controls. Premanifest-HD required more time to complete the test than controls. Significant correlations were found between hand variables and Late-Life FDI, Neuro-QoL, HD-ADL, and UHDRS-TMS. <b>Conclusions:</b> HD affects manipulative dexterity and hand function in premanifest and manifest patients. Therefore, to prevent disability and decreased QoL, evaluating the progression of upper limb dysfunction in HD is important to offer the best possible therapeutic interventions."

    "title": "Movement Disorders and Smart Wrist Devices: A Comprehensive Study.",
    "abstract": "In the medical field, there are several very different movement disorders, such as tremors, Parkinson's disease, or Huntington's disease. A wide range of motor and non-motor symptoms characterizes them. It is evident that in the modern era, the use of smart wrist devices, such as smartwatches, wristbands, and smart bracelets is spreading among all categories of people. This diffusion is justified by the limited costs, ease of use, and less invasiveness (and consequently greater acceptability) than other types of sensors used for health status monitoring. This systematic review aims to synthesize research studies using smart wrist devices for a specific class of movement disorders. Following PRISMA-S guidelines, 130 studies were selected and analyzed. For each selected study, information is provided relating to the smartwatch/wristband/bracelet model used (whether it is commercial or not), the number of end-users involved in the experimentation stage, and finally the characteristics of the benchmark dataset possibly used for testing. Moreover, some articles also reported the type of raw data extracted from the smart wrist device, the implemented designed algorithmic pipeline, and the data classification methodology. It turned out that most of the studies have been published in the last ten years, showing a growing interest in the scientific community. The selected articles mainly investigate the relationship between smart wrist devices and Parkinson's disease. Epilepsy and seizure detection are also research topics of interest, while there are few papers analyzing gait disorders, Huntington's Disease, ataxia, or Tourette Syndrome. However, the results of this review highlight the difficulties still present in the use of the smartwatch/wristband/bracelet for the identified categories of movement disorders, despite the advantages these technologies could bring in the dissemination of low-cost solutions usable directly within living environments and without the need for caregivers or medical personnel."

    "title": "Advances in Stem Cell Therapy for Huntington's Disease: A Comprehensive Literature Review.",
    "abstract": "Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited neurodegenerative disease characterized by uncontrolled movements, emotional disturbances, and progressive cognitive impairment. It is estimated to affect 4.3 to 10.6 per 100,000 people worldwide, and the mean prevalence rate among all published studies, reviews, and genetic HD registries is 5.7 per 100,000. A key feature of HD is the loss of striatal neurons and cortical atrophy. Although there is no cure at present, the discovery of the gene causing HD has brought us into a new DNA era and therapeutic advances for several neurological disorders. PubMed was systematically searched using three search strings: '\"Huntington disease\" + \"stem cell\"', '\"Huntington disease\" + Mesenchymal stromal cell', and '\"Huntington disease\" + \"induced pluripotent stem cell\"'. For each string, the search results were categorized based on cell type, and papers that included a clinical analysis were categorized as well. The data were extracted up to 2024. We did not include other databases in our search to have a comparable and systematic review of the literature on the topic. The collected data were analyzed and used for critical interpretation in the present review. Data are presented chronologically as clinical studies were published. Therapeutic strategies based on stem cells have drawn a lot of interest as possible HD therapies. Recent research indicates that NSCs have been the most often utilized stem cell type for treating HD. NSCs have been generated and extracted from a variety of sources, including HD patients' somatic cells and the brain itself. There is strong evidence supporting the transplantation of stem cells or their derivatives in HD animal models, even if stem-cell-based preclinical and clinical trials are still in their early stages. Current treatment only aims at relieving the symptoms rather than treating the pathogenesis of the disease. Although preclinical trials in HD models have shown promise in improving cognitive and motor functions, stem cell therapy still faces many challenges and disadvantages including immunosuppression and immunorejection as well as ethical, technical, and safety concerns. Further research is required for a definitive conclusion."

Growing evidence suggests that disrupted neuronal calcium signalling contributes to the pathophysiology of NDs. Additionally, calcium functions as a ubiquitous second messenger involved in diverse cellular processes, from synaptic activity to intercellular communication, making it a potential therapeutic target. Recently, the development of the miniature fluorescence microscope (miniscope) enabled simultaneous recording of the spatiotemporal calcium activity from large neuronal ensembles in unrestrained animals, providing a novel method for studying NDs. In this review, we discuss the abnormalities observed in calcium signalling and its potential as a therapeutic target for NDs. Additionally, we highlight recent studies that utilise miniscope technology to investigate the alterations in calcium dynamics associated with NDs."

    "abstract": "Mismatch repair (MMR) is a highly conserved DNA repair pathway that recognizes mispairs that occur spontaneously during DNA replication and coordinates their repair. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Msh2-Msh3 and Msh2-Msh6 initiate MMR by recognizing and binding insertion or deletion (in/del) loops up to ∼17 nucleotides (nt.) and base-base mispairs, respectively; the 2 complexes have overlapping specificity for small (1-2 nt.) in/dels. The DNA-binding specificity for the 2 complexes resides in their respective mispair binding domains (MBDs) and has distinct DNA-binding modes. Msh2-Msh3 also plays a role in promoting CAG/CTG trinucleotide repeat (TNR) expansions, which underlie many neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington's disease and myotonic dystrophy type 1. Models for Msh2-Msh3's role in promoting TNR tract expansion have invoked its specific DNA-binding activity and predict that the TNR structure alters its DNA binding and downstream activities to block repair. Using a chimeric Msh complex that replaces the MBD of Msh6 with the Msh3 MBD, we demonstrate that Msh2-Msh3 DNA-binding activity is not sufficient to promote TNR expansions. We propose a model for Msh2-Msh3-mediated TNR expansions that requires a fully functional Msh2-Msh3 including DNA binding, coordinated ATP binding, and hydrolysis activities and interactions with Mlh complexes that are analogous to those required for MMR."

    "abstract": "Rare diseases may affect the quality of life of patients and be life-threatening. Therapeutic opportunities are often limited, in part because of the lack of understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying these diseases. This can be ascribed to the low prevalence of rare diseases and therefore the lower sample sizes available for research. A way to overcome this is to integrate experimental rare disease data with prior knowledge using network-based methods. Taking this one step further, we hypothesized that combining and analyzing the results from multiple network-based methods could provide data-driven hypotheses of pathogenic mechanisms from multiple perspectives.We analyzed a Huntington's disease transcriptomics dataset using six network-based methods in a collaborative way. These methods either inherently reported enriched annotation terms or their results were fed into enrichment analyses. The resulting significantly enriched Reactome pathways were then summarized using the ontological hierarchy which allowed the integration and interpretation of outputs from multiple methods. Among the resulting enriched pathways, there are pathways that have been shown previously to be involved in Huntington's disease and pathways whose direct contribution to disease pathogenesis remains unclear and requires further investigation.In summary, our study shows that collaborative network analysis approaches are well-suited to study rare diseases, as they provide hypotheses for pathogenic mechanisms from multiple perspectives. Applying different methods to the same case study can uncover different disease mechanisms that would not be apparent with the application of a single method."

    "abstract": "Integrating dietary interventions have been extensively studied for their health benefits, such as Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, and aging. However, it is necessary to fully understand the mechanisms of long-term effects and practical applications of these dietary interventions for health. A 10-week intermittent fasting (IMF) regimen was implemented on the aging animals in the current study. The variations of cerebral functions were analyzed employing a comprehensive experimental design that includes behavioral tests, neuroimaging, and ultrastructural analysis, such as resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI), EEG/EMG recordings, transmission electron microscopy, and immunohistochemistry. Over a 10-week regimen, IMF significantly improved locomotor activity, motor coordination, and muscle strength compared to controls (p < 0.01). Resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI) demonstrated that IMF modulates brain-wide functional connectivity, enhancing communication between key brain regions. Advanced imaging techniques revealed increased expression of myelin-related proteins, including myelin basic protein (MBP), and myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG), indicating enhanced myelin integrity and repair, particularly in axons with diameters < 400 nm (p < 0.01). These findings suggest that IMF may mitigate age-related declines by promoting better neuronal signaling. This study highlights the potential function of IMF as a non-pharmacological intervention to promote brain health and mitigate cognitive decline in aging populations."

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial dysfunction and neuronal damage are major sign of cytopathology in Huntington's disease (HD), a neurodegenerative disease. Ubiquitin specific peptidase 11 (USP11) is a deubiquitinating enzyme involved in various physiological processes through regulating protein degradation. However, its specific role in HD is unclear. To interfere with USP11 expression, adeno-associated viruses 2 containing USP11-specific shRNA were injected into the bilateral striatum of 12-week-old R6/1 and WT mice. In vitro, the inducible PC12 cell model of HD was used in which the expression of an N-terminal truncation of huntingtin, with either wild type (Q23) or expanded polyglutamine (Q74) can be induced by the doxycycline. USP11 was knocked down to study its role in HD. The protein expression patterns in Q74 cells were quantified by label-free proteomics to further explore the target protein of USP11. Detecting the association between USP11 and Phosphatase and Tensin Homolog (PTEN) through Co-IP. Herein, USP11 was found to be upregulated in the striatum of R6/1 mice (an HD model with gradual development of symptoms) in an age-dependent manner. The spontaneous HD was alleviated by silencing USP11, as evidenced by improved locomotor activity and spatial memory, attenuated striatal atrophy in R6/1 mice, reduced accumulation of mutant huntingtin protein, and restored mitochondrial function in vitro and in vivo. The results of label-free proteomics revealed a significant change in the protein expression profile. Through functional enrichment, we focused on PTEN, known as a negative regulator of the AKT pathway. We demonstrated that USP11 downregulation promoted ubiquitination modification of PTEN and activated the AKT pathway, and PTEN overexpression reversed the effects of USP11 knockdown. Collectively, USP11 knockdown protects R6/1 mouse neurons from oxidative stress by alleviating mitochondrial dysfunction, thereby preventing the HD progression. This is achieved by inhibiting PTEN expression, which in turn activates the AKT pathway. This study suggests that USP11-PTEN-AKT signaling pathway may be a new attractive therapeutic target for HD."

    "abstract": "Huntington's disease (HD), a neurodegenerative disease, affects approximately 30,000 people in the United States, with 200,000 more at risk. Mitochondrial dysfunction caused by mutant huntingtin (mHTT) drives early HD pathophysiology. mHTT binds the translocase of the mitochondrial inner membrane (TIM23) complex, inhibiting mitochondrial protein import and altering the mitochondrial proteome. The 17 aa HTT N-terminal sequence (N17) acts as a regulatory domain in HD pathogenesis; phosphomimetic modification of serines 13 and 16 of the N17 domain impacts subcellular localization and degradation and ameliorates toxicity in mouse and cell models of HD. Using cellular and mouse (either sex) HD models, we investigated the mechanisms by which HTT phosphorylation affects intracellular localization. We demonstrate that introducing phosphomimetic mutations within the mHTT fragment N17 domain decreased TIM23 binding affinity and reduced inhibition of mHTT-mediated mitochondrial protein import. BACHD-SD mice expressing full-length mHTT harboring the same two N17 phosphomimetic mutations have an ameliorated HD-like phenotype as compared with mice expressing mHTT. Consistent with reduced toxicity in vivo, we found that the amount of full-length mHTT in the brain mitochondria of BACHD-SD transgenic mice is less when the mHTT has two phosphomimetic mutations. To complement the relevance of the phosphomimetic HTT findings, endogenous N17 phospho-mHTT is less likely to translocate to the mitochondria compared with nonphosphorylated mHTT. We demonstrate that phosphorylation of mHTT at serines 13 and 16 is critical for negatively regulating mHTT mitochondrial targeting and that reducing mHTT mitochondrial localization and binding to TIM23 results in amelioration of mHTT-induced mitochondrial and neuronal toxicity."

Traditional Chinese medicine, with its multicomponent and multitarget characteristics, offers a promising approach to treating neurodegenerative diseases. However, comprehensively elucidating the complex mechanisms underlying traditional Chinese medicine formulations remains challenging. As an emerging systems biology method, network pharmacology has provided a vital tool for revealing the multitarget mechanisms of traditional Chinese medicine through high-throughput technologies, molecular docking, and network analysis.

Clustering analysis was used to identify patterns of coffee drinking timing. In this observational study, two distinct patterns of coffee drinking timing [morning type (36% of participants) and all-day-type patterns (14% of participants)] were identified in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and were validated in the Women's and Men's Lifestyle Validation Study. During a median (interquartile range) follow-up of 9.8 (9.1) years, a total of 4295 all-cause deaths, 1268 cardiovascular disease deaths, and 934 cancer deaths were recorded. After adjustment for caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee intake amounts, sleep hours, and other confounders, the morning-type pattern, rather than the all-day-type pattern, was significantly associated with lower risks of all-cause (hazard ratio: .84; 95% confidential interval: .74-.95) and cardiovascular disease-specific (hazard ratio: .69; 95% confidential interval: .55-.87) mortality as compared with non-coffee drinking. Coffee drinking timing significantly modified the association between coffee intake amounts and all-cause mortality (P-interaction = .031); higher coffee intake amounts were significantly associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality in participants with morning-type pattern but not in those with all-day-type pattern. Drinking coffee in the morning may be more strongly associated with a lower risk of mortality than drinking coffee later in the day."

    "abstract": "The brain is the organ with the highest cholesterol content in the body. Cholesterol in the brain plays a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of synapses and myelin sheaths to ensure normal brain function. Disruptions in cholesterol metabolism are closely associated with various central nervous system (CNS) diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Huntington's disease (HD), and multiple sclerosis (MS). In this review, we explore the synthesis, regulation, transport, and functional roles of cholesterol in the CNS. We discuss in detail the associations between cholesterol homeostasis imbalance and CNS diseases including AD, HD, and MS, highlighting the significant role of cholesterol metabolism abnormalities in the development of these diseases. Sterol regulatory element binding protein-2 (SREBP2) and liver X receptor (LXR) are two critical transcription factors that play central roles in cholesterol synthesis and reverse transport, respectively. Their cooperative interaction finely tunes the balance of brain cholesterol metabolism, presenting potential therapeutic value for preventing and treating CNS diseases. We particularly emphasize the alterations in SREBP2 and LXR under pathological conditions and their impacts on disease progression. This review summarizes current therapeutic agents targeting these two pathways, with the hope of broadening the perspectives of CNS drug developers and encouraging further study into SREBP2 and LXR-related therapies for CNS diseases."

    "abstract": "CAG/CTG repeats are prone to expansion, causing several inherited human diseases. The initiating sources of DNA damage which lead to inaccurate repair of the repeat tract to cause expansions are not fully understood. Expansion-prone CAG/CTG repeats are actively transcribed and prone to forming stable R-loops with hairpin structures forming on the displaced single-stranded DNA (S-loops). We previously determined that damage by the <i><i>Saccharomyces</i> cerevisiae</i> cytosine deaminase, Fcy1, was required for both fragility and instability of CAG/CTG tracts engaged in R-loops. To determine whether this mechanism is more universal, we expressed human cytidine deaminases APOBEC3A (A3A), APOBEC3B (A3B), or activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) in our yeast system. We show that mutagenic activity of Apolipoprotein B messenger RNA-editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptides causes CAG/CTG fragility and instability, with A3A having the greatest effect followed by A3B and least from AID. A3A-induced repeat fragility was exacerbated by enrichment of R-loops at the repeat site. A3A and A3B-induced instability was dependent on the MutLγ nuclease and to a lesser extent, base excision repair factors. Deaminase activity assays on hairpin substrates containing CTG and GTC triplet sequences revealed that A3A prefers cytidines within the hairpin loop, and bulges in the hairpin stem alter preferred locations. Analysis of RNA expression levels in human cortex samples revealed that A3A is expressed in brain tissue that exhibits CAG/CTG repeat expansions and its expression is elevated in Huntington's disease (HD) patient samples. These results implicate cytidine deamination by A3A as a potential source of repeat expansions in HD and other CAG/CTG repeat expansion disorders."

    "abstract": "The brain contains many interconnected and complex cellular and molecular mechanisms. Injury to the brain causes permanent dysfunctions in these mechanisms. So, it continues to be an area where surgical intervention cannot be performed except for the removal of tumors and the repair of some aneurysms. Some agents that can cross the blood-brain barrier and reach neurons show neuroprotective effects in the brain due to their anti-apoptotic, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. In particular, some agents act by reducing or modulating the accumulation of protein aggregates in neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and prion disease) caused by protein accumulation. Substrate accumulation causes increased oxidative stress and stimulates the brain's immune cells, microglia, and astrocytes, to secrete proinflammatory cytokines. Long-term or chronic neuroinflammatory response triggers apoptosis. Brain damage is observed with neuronal apoptosis and brain functions are impaired. This situation negatively affects processes such as motor movements, memory, perception, and learning. Neuroprotective agents prevent apoptosis by modulating molecules that play a role in apoptosis. In addition, they can improve impaired brain functions by supporting neuroplasticity and neurogenesis. Due to the important roles that these agents play in central nervous system damage or neurodegenerative diseases, it is important to elucidate many mechanisms. This review provides an overview of the mechanisms of flavonoids, which constitute a large part of the agents with neuroprotective effects, as well as vitamins, neurotransmitters, hormones, amino acids, and their derivatives. It is thought that understanding these mechanisms will enable the development of new therapeutic agents and different treatment strategies."

    "abstract": "The predominant neurodegenerative diseases, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy Bodies, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and frontotemporal dementia, are rarely pure diseases but, instead, show a diversity of mixed pathologies. At some level, all of them share a combination of one or more different toxic biomarker proteins: amyloid beta (Aβ), phosphorylated Tau (pTau), alpha-synuclein (αSyn), mutant huntingtin (mHtt), fused in sarcoma, superoxide dismutase 1, and TAR DNA-binding protein 43. These toxic proteins share some common attributes, making them potentially universal and simultaneous targets for therapeutic intervention. First, they all form toxic aggregates prior to taking on their final forms as contributors to plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, Lewy bodies, and other protein deposits. Second, the primary enzyme that directs their aggregation is transglutaminase 2 (TGM2), a brain-localized enzyme involved in neurodegeneration. Third, TGM2 binds to calmodulin, a regulatory event that can increase the activity of this enzyme threefold. Fourth, the most common mixed pathology toxic biomarkers (Aβ, pTau, αSyn, nHtt) also bind calmodulin, which can affect their ability to aggregate. This review examines the potential therapeutic routes opened up by this knowledge. The end goal reveals multiple opportunities that are immediately available for universal therapeutic treatment of the most devastating neurodegenerative diseases facing humankind."

    "abstract": "Huntington's disease is a genetic disorder characterized by progressive neuronal cell damage in some areas of the brain; symptoms are commonly associated with chorea, rigidity and dystonia. The symptoms in Huntington's Disease are caused by a pathological increase in the number of Cytokine-Adenine-Guanine (CAG) repeats on the first exon of the Huntingtin gene, which causes a protein to have an excessive number of glutamine residues; this alteration leads to a change in the protein's conformation and function. Therefore, the purpose of this work was to design, synthesize and evaluate an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO; 95 nucleotides) HTT 90-5 directed to the Huntingtin CAG repeats in primary leukocyte culture cells from a patient with Huntington's Disease; approximately 500,000 leukocytes per well extracted from venous blood were used, to which 100 pMol of ASO were administered, and the expression of Huntingtin was subsequently evaluated at 72 h by RT-PCR. Our results showed that the administration of the HTT 90-5 antisense decreased the expression of Huntingtin mRNA in the primary culture leukocyte cells from our patient. These results suggest that the use of long antisense targeting the CAG Huntingtin cluster may be an option to decrease the expression of Huntingtin and probably could be adjusted depending on the number of CAG repeats in the cluster."

    "abstract": "Histone methyltransferases (HMTs) and histone demethylases (HDMs) are critical enzymes that regulate chromatin dynamics and gene expression through the addition and removal of methyl groups on histone proteins. HMTs, such as PRC2 and SETD2, are involved in the trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 and lysine 36, influencing gene silencing and activation. Dysregulation of these enzymes often leads to abnormal gene expression and contributes to tumorigenesis. In contrast, HDMs including KDM7A and KDM2A reverse these methylation marks, and their dysfunction can drive disease progression. In cancer, the aberrant activity of specific HMTs and HDMs can lead to the silencing of tumor suppressor genes or the activation of oncogenes, facilitating tumor progression and resistance to therapy. Conversely, in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and Huntington's disease (HD), disruptions in histone methylation dynamics are associated with neuronal loss, altered gene expression, and disease progression. We aimed to comprehend the odd activity of HMTs and HDMs and how they contribute to disease pathogenesis, highlighting their potential as therapeutic targets. By advancing our understanding of these epigenetic regulators, this review provides new insights into their roles in cancer and neurodegenerative diseases, offering a foundation for future research."

    "abstract": "Huntington disease (HD), a neurodegenerative autosomal dominant disorder, is characterized by involuntary choreatic movements with cognitive and behavioral disturbances. Up to now, no therapeutic strategies are available to completely ameliorate the progression of HD. <i>Schisandra chinensis</i> has various pharmacologic effects such as antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. However, the neuroprotective value of seed oil of <i>S. chinensis</i> (SOSC) has not been elucidated yet. The purpose of this study was to determine neuroprotective effects of SOSC by supercritical fluid extraction against 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NPA)-induced HD-like symptoms and neuropathology in an experimental mouse model. SOSC (75, 150, and 300 mg/kg/day) was orally pre-administration once daily at 1 hour before 3-NPA intoxication. SOSC ameliorated movement dysfunction and lethality following 3-NPA intoxication in connection with reduction of lesion area, neurodegeneration/apoptosis, microglial migration/activation, and mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines/enzymes in the striatum. SOSC inhibited the activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPKs) pathways but stimulated nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) in the striatum after 3-NPA intoxication. Schizandrin, a main component of SOSC, reduced protein expression levels of Iba-1 and p-NF-κB in 3-NPA-induced BV2 cells (murine microglia cell line). BV2 cell's conditioned medium inhibited cleaved caspase-3 in 3-NPA-induced SH-SY5Y cells (a neuroblastoma cell line). SOSC might ameliorate movement dysfunction by inhibiting neuropathology through its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities in the striata of 3-NPA-intoxicated mice. These findings suggest that SOSC could serve as a promising therapeutic candidate for HD-like symptoms, providing a foundation for future treatment strategies targeting neuroinflammation and oxidative stress."

    "abstract": "Huntington's Disease (HD), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with no disease-modifying therapies, is caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the HD gene encoding polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin (HTT) protein. Mechanisms of HD cellular pathogenesis and cellular functions of the normal and mutant HTT proteins are still not completely understood. HTT protein has numerous interaction partners, and it likely provides a scaffold for assembly of multiprotein complexes many of which may be altered in HD. Previous studies have implicated DNA damage response in HD pathogenesis. Gene transcription and RNA processing has also emerged as molecular mechanisms associated with HD. Here we used multiple approaches to identify HTT interactors in the context of DNA damage stress. Our results indicate that HTT interacts with many proteins involved in the regulation of interconnected DNA repair/remodeling and RNA processing pathways. We present evidence for a role for HTT in double strand break repair mechanism. We demonstrate HTT functional interaction with a major DNA damage response kinase DNA-PKcs and association of both proteins with nuclear speckles. We show that S1181 phosphorylation of HTT is regulated by DSB, and can be carried out (at least <i>in vitro</i>) by DNA-PK. Furthermore, we show HTT interactions with RNA binding proteins associated with nuclear speckles, including two proteins encoded by genes at HD modifier loci, TCERG1 and MED15, and with chromatin remodeling complex BAF. These interactions of HTT may position it as an important scaffolding intermediary providing integrated regulation of gene expression and RNA processing in the context of DNA repair mechanisms."

    "abstract": "Anti-gene oligonucleotides belong to a group of therapeutic compounds, which, in contrast to antisense oligonucleotides, bind to DNA. Clamp anti-gene oligonucleotides bind through a double-stranded invasion mechanism. With two arms connected by a linker, they hybridize to one of the DNA strands forming Watson-Crick and Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds. Here, we investigated the design of 30 locked nucleic acid-DNA mixmers with or without a strong intercalating moiety (M3) to target polypurine⋅polypyrimidine sequences from the <i>MYC</i> or the <i>Huntingtin</i> gene. Introducing M3 as a linker proved to be essential for strand invasion. Additional M3 at the end of the Watson-Crick- or the Hoogsteen-binding strand could be beneficial depending on the clamp orientation. Invasion was superior when the linker was located adjacent to sequences with high GC content. For <i>in vivo</i> application, we assessed strand-invasion of phosphorothioate-modified clamp anti-gene oligonucleotides. While the binding kinetics was slower than for the corresponding phosphodiester clamps, equal invasion was eventually reached. Lastly, we demonstrated, that the clamp anti-gene oligonucleotide targeting a <i>single</i> site in the template strand of the <i>Huntingtin</i> gene induces significant mRNA down-regulation in patient-derived fibroblasts, boding well for the anti-gene therapeutic concept."

    "abstract": "Huntington's disease (HD) is caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the HTT gene, leading to altered gene expression. However, the mechanisms leading to disrupted RNA processing in HD remain unclear. Here we identify TDP-43 and the N6-methyladenosine (m6A) writer protein METTL3 to be upstream regulators of exon skipping in multiple HD systems. Disrupted nuclear localization of TDP-43 and cytoplasmic accumulation of phosphorylated TDP-43 occurs in HD mouse and human brains, with TDP-43 also co-localizing with HTT nuclear aggregate-like bodies distinct from mutant HTT inclusions. The binding of TDP-43 onto RNAs encoding HD-associated differentially expressed and aberrantly spliced genes is decreased. Finally, m6A RNA modification is reduced on RNAs abnormally expressed in the striatum of HD R6/2 mouse brain, including at clustered sites adjacent to TDP-43 binding sites. Our evidence supports TDP-43 loss of function coupled with altered m6A modification as a mechanism underlying alternative splicing in HD."

    "abstract": "Fatigue is prevalent in immune-mediated inflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases, yet its assessment relies largely on patient-reported outcomes, which capture perception but not fluctuations over time. Wearable sensors, like inertial measurement units (IMUs), offer a way to monitor daily activities and evaluate functional capacity. This study investigates the relationship between sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit transitions and self-reported physical and mental fatigue in participants with Parkinson's, Huntington's, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, primary Sjögren's syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease. Over 4 weeks, participants wore an IMU and reported fatigue levels four times daily. Using mixed-effects models, associations were identified between fatigue and specific kinematic features, such as 5th and 95th percentiles of sit-to-stand performance, suggesting that fatigue alters the control and effort of movement. These kinematic features show promise as indicators for fatigue in these patient populations."

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are characterized by the progressive degeneration of neuronal structure and function, leading to severe cognitive and motor impairments. These conditions present significant challenges to healthcare systems, and traditional treatments often fail to account for genetic variability among patients, resulting in inconsistent therapeutic outcomes. Pharmacogenomics aims to tailor medical treatments based on an individual's genetic profile, thereby improving therapeutic efficacy and reducing adverse effects. This focused review explores the genetic factors influencing drug responses in neurodegenerative diseases and the potential of pharmacogenomics to revolutionize their treatment. Key genetic markers, such as the APOE ε4 allele in AD and the CYP2D6 polymorphisms in PD, are highlighted for their roles in modulating drug efficacy. Additionally, advancements in pharmacogenomic tools, including genome-wide association studies (GWAS), next-generation sequencing (NGS), and CRISPR-Cas9, are discussed for their contributions to personalized medicine. The application of pharmacogenomics in clinical practice and its prospects, including ethical and data integration challenges, are also examined."

    "abstract": "Positron emission tomography (PET) is frequently used to obtain target occupancy (%TO) of central nervous system (CNS) drug candidates during clinical development. Obtaining %TO with PET can be particularly powerful when the %TO associated with efficacy is known for a protein target. Using the radiotracer [<sup>18</sup>F]AV-133, the relationship between plasma concentration (PK) and %TO of NBI-750142, an experimental inhibitor of the vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 (VMAT2) was obtained in both nonhuman primate (NHP) and human. This work established [<sup>18</sup>F]AV-133 PET as capable of providing a VMAT2 inhibitor PK-%TO relationship that translated from NHP to human. To establish the VMAT2%TO benchmark, PET was performed in NHP with NBI-98782, the main active metabolite of valbenazine, and this PK-%TO relationship was used to estimate VMAT2%TO at NBI-98782 exposures associated with valbenazine therapeutic effects in the treatment of tardive dyskinesia (TD). This work defined 85-90% as the VMAT2%TO achieved by exposures associated with daily dosing with 80 mg valbenazine, a dosing regimen known to exhibit a large effect size in the treatment of TD and in the treatment of chorea associated with Huntington's Disease. NBI-750142 was estimated to achieve 36-78% VMAT2 target occupancy at acceptable doses, indicating potential inferiority in conferring clinical benefit compared to valbenazine. It is recommended that the %TO benchmark of valbenazine derived from [<sup>18</sup>F]AV-133 PET serve as a gold standard biomarker to evaluate novel VMAT2 inhibitors undergoing clinical development."

    "abstract": "Huntington's disease (HD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease resulting from a mutation in the huntingtin (HTT) gene and characterized by progressive motor dysfunction, cognitive decline, and psychiatric disturbances. Currently, no disease-modifying treatments are available. Recent research has developed therapeutic agents that may have the potential to directly target the disease pathology, such as gene silencing or clearing the mutant protein. However, these agents are limited by their inability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), preventing optimal therapeutic effects. Although various techniques have been explored to overcome the BBB, focused ultrasound (FUS) has emerged as a promising non-invasive therapeutic modality offering the potential for targeted intervention in neurodegenerative diseases, including HD. Preclinical studies demonstrated the safety and efficacy of FUS in delivering therapeutic agents, such as siRNAs and AAV vector-based gene therapy, resulting in significant reductions in mutant HTT expression and improvements in motor function in HD mouse models. Furthermore, the safety profile of FUS-induced BBB opening has been established in clinical trials on human patients of neurodegenerative diseases other than HD, showing no adverse effects on brain structure or function. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of FUS research in HD and connects existing evidence from neurodegenerative disease studies with its promise in establishing disease-modifying therapies for HD."

    "title": "The joint memory effect: challenging the selfish stigma in Huntington's disease?",
    "abstract": "The prevalent belief that individuals with Huntington's disease exhibit selfish behaviour, disregarding the thoughts, feelings and actions of others, has been challenged by patient organizations and clinical experts. To further investigate this issue and study whether participants with Huntington's disease can pay attention to others, a joint memory task was carried out in patients with Huntington's disease with and without a partner. This study involved 69 participants at an early stage of Huntington's disease and 56 healthy controls from the UK, France and Germany, who participated in the international Repair-HD multicentre study (NCT03119246). Participants completed a semantic categorization task across three categories: animals, fruits and vegetables and manufactured objects. They performed the task either alone (Alone condition) or with the examiner acting as a partner (Pair condition). In the Pair condition, the participant was assigned one category, their partner was assigned another and one category was left unassigned. Afterwards, participants engaged in a surprise free recall task to remember as many words as possible. Words not assigned to anyone were considered socially irrelevant in contrast to the ones assigned to the participant and to the partner. Both groups demonstrated the expected self-prioritization effect, recalling their assigned words better than their partner's or unassigned words in both conditions. Additionally, a joint memory effect was observed, with better recall for the partner's assigned words than the unassigned words in the Pair condition (controls: difference = 0.45, <i>P</i> < 0.001; participants with Huntington's disease: difference = 0.34, <i>P</i> < 0.001). Socially relevant words were thus better recalled than irrelevant words. The number of recalled words correlated with cognitive performance (all <i>P</i>-values < 0.05) and MRI analysis revealed a negative correlation between the joint memory effect and right orbitofrontal grey matter density in participants with Huntington's disease. These findings challenge the notion that individuals with Huntington's disease display selfish behaviours because of disinterest in others. They show the ability to process information about their partners, implying that their social difficulties may arise from factors other than social cognition deficits. This opens the door for more ecological assessments of social cognition in patients with Huntington's disease."

As the origins of those proteinopathies have been biochemically traced and genetically mapped, genetically engineered animal models carrying the specific mutations or variants are widely used for investigating the etiology of these diseases, as well as for testing potential therapeutics. This article focuses on the mouse models of Alzheimer disease and closely related frontotemporal dementia, particularly the ones that have provided most valuable knowledge, or are in a trajectory of doing so. More importantly, some of the major findings from these models are summarized, based on the recent single-cell transcriptomics, multiomics, and spatial transcriptomics studies. While no model is perfect, it is hoped that the new insights from these models and the practical use of these models will continue to help to establish a path forward."

Both processes are central to the development and progression of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs). We hypothesize that TYMP plays a role in AAA development. <b>Methods:</b> Male wild-type (WT) C57BL/6J and <i>Tymp<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice, fed a Western diet (WD) (TD.88137), were subjected to the 4-week Ang II infusion-induced AAA model. AAA progression was monitored by echography and confirmed through necropsy. Whole-body inflammation was assessed using a plasma cytokine array. Mechanistic studies were conducted using TYMP-overexpressing rat VSMC cell lines and primary VSMCs cultured from WT and <i>Tymp<sup>-/-</sup></i> mouse thoracic aortas. Histological studies were performed on human AAA and normal aorta samples. <b>Results:</b> Elevated TYMP levels were observed in human AAA vessel walls. While WT mice exhibited a 28.6% prevalence of Ang II infusion-induced AAA formation, <i>Tymp<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice were protected. TYMP enhanced MMP2 expression, secretion, and activation in VSMCs, which was inhibited by tipiracil, a selective TYMP inhibitor. Systemically, TYMP promoted proinflammatory cytokine expression, and its absence attenuated TNF-<i>α</i>-induced MMP2 and AKT activation. WT VSMCs treated with platelets lacking TYMP showed a higher proliferation rate than cells treated with WT platelets. Additionally, TYMP increased activated TGF<i>β</i>1 expression in cultured VSMCs and human AAA vessel walls. In WT VSMCs, TYMP augmented thrombospondin-1 type 1 repeat domain (TSR)-stimulated TGF<i>β</i>1 signaling, increasing connective tissue growth factor and MMP2 production. TSR also enhanced AKT activation in WT VSMCs but had the opposite effect in <i>Tymp<sup>-/-</sup></i> cells. TSR-enhanced MMP2 activation in WT VSMCs was attenuated by LY294002 (a PI3K inhibitor) but not by SB431542 (a TGF<i>β</i>1 inhibitor); both inhibitors had indiscernible effects on <i>Tymp<sup>-/-</sup></i> VSMC. <b>Conclusion:</b> TYMP emerges as a novel regulatory force in vascular biology, influencing VSMC function and inflammatory responses to promote AAA development."

    "abstract": "Influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are acute respiratory infections (ARIs) that can cause substantial morbidity and mortality among at-risk individuals, including older adults. In this narrative review, we summarize themes identified in the literature regarding the epidemiology, seasonality, immunity after infection, clinical presentation, and transmission for these ARIs, along with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on seasonal patterns of influenza and RSV infections, with consideration of data specific to older adults when available. As the older adult population increases globally, it is of paramount importance to fully characterize the true disease burden of ARIs in order to develop appropriate mitigation strategies to minimize their impact in vulnerable populations. Challenges associated with characterizing the burden of these diseases include the shared symptomology and clinical presentation of influenza virus, RSV, and SARS-CoV-2, which complicate accurate diagnosis and highlight the need for improved testing and surveillance practices. To this end, multiple regional, national, and global virologic and disease surveillance systems have been established to provide accurate knowledge of viral epidemiology, support appropriate preparedness and response to potential outbreaks, and help inform prevention strategies to reduce disease severity and transmission. Beyond the burden of acute illness, long-term health consequences can also result from influenza virus, RSV, and SARS-CoV-2 infection. These include cardiovascular and pulmonary complications, worsening of existing chronic conditions, increased frailty, and reduced life expectancy. ARIs among older adults can also place a substantial financial burden on society and healthcare systems. Collectively, the existing data indicate that influenza virus, RSV, and SARS-CoV-2 infections in older adults present a substantial global health challenge, underscoring the need for interventions to improve health outcomes and reduce the disease burden of respiratory illnesses.Graphical abstract and video abstract available for this article."

The purpose of this chapter is to summarize current evidence behind the use of CBM in selected neurological diseases, mainly movement and neurodegenerative disorders. The best evidence for efficacy of CBM is for Tourette syndrome resulting in an improvement of tics and psychiatric comorbidities. In this indication, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)-containing CBMs are recommended. There is limited evidence that CBMs are also effective in Parkinson's disease in which they may improve tremor, but also non-motor symptoms such as pain and sleeping problems. With respect to other neurodegenerative diseases, there is limited evidence that CBMs may improve behavioral symptoms in Huntington's disease. In addition, it has been speculated that CBMs may have neuroprotective effects, but this has not yet been confirmed in the clinical setting."

A particular pathogenic role has been attributed to the aggregation-prone huntingtin exon 1 (HTTex1), generated by aberrant splicing or proteolysis, and containing the expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) segment. Unlike amyloid fibrils from Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, the atomic-level structure of HTTex1 fibrils has remained unknown, limiting diagnostic and treatment efforts. We present and analyze the structure of fibrils formed by polyQ peptides and polyQ-expanded HTTex1 in vitro. Atomic-resolution perspectives are enabled by an integrative analysis and unrestrained all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations incorporating experimental data from electron microscopy (EM), solid-state NMR, and other techniques. Alongside the use of prior data, we report magic angle spinning NMR studies of glutamine residues of the polyQ fibril core and surface, distinguished via hydrogen-deuterium exchange (HDX). Our study provides a molecular understanding of the structure of the core as well as surface of aggregated HTTex1, including the fuzzy coat and polyQ-water interface. The obtained data are discussed in context of their implications for understanding the detection of such aggregates (diagnostics) as well as known biological properties of the fibrils."

Risdiplam, a daily oral therapy, was approved in the United States for the treatment of SMA. Risdiplam's effectiveness depends on patient adherence to the treatment regimen. This retrospective claims database analysis assessed real-world treatment adherence and persistence, and all-cause health care costs by adherence status, for patients with SMA receiving risdiplam. Outcomes were summarized by SMA types (1-4) and age groups (0-2, 3-5, 6-17, and ≥ 18 years). 86 patients with ≥ 1 SMA diagnosis, risdiplam treatment, and ≥ 6 months of continuous enrollment after the index date (SMA diagnosis) were identified in the IQVIA PharMetrics<sup>®</sup> Plus database (01/01/2020-06/30/2022). One patient had SMA type 1 (a 1-year-old boy), 18 had type 2 (mean ± SD age: 7.9 ± 5.7 years; 61% female), 47 had type 3 (17.3 ± 10.2 years; 55% female), and 20 had type 4 (38.2 ± 11.6 years; 55% female). The mean proportion of days covered (PDC) with risdiplam was 0.89 overall, ranging from 0.88 for SMA type 4 to 0.97 for type 1. The majority (83.7%) of patients were adherent to risdiplam (PDC ≥0.80), ranging from 75.0% for type 4 to 100% for type 1. Adherence ranged from 76.5% among 6-12-year-olds to 100% among 0-2-year-olds. Compared with adherent patients, nonadherent patients had higher median total health care costs by $335,049 for type 2, $41,204 for type 3, and $12,223 for type 4. Among adherent patients, patients with PDC between 0.90 and 1.00 had lower costs compared with patients with PDC between 0.80 and 0.90. Nonadherence to risdiplam was observed in the first year of treatment, especially for patients with SMA type 4 and patients aged 6-12 years. Nonadherence was associated with higher all-cause health care costs, with the most pronounced cost difference for SMA type 2. For adherent patients, those who were highly adherent incurred lower health care costs. These findings underscore the importance of treatment adherence and persistence for patients with SMA receiving risdiplam, particularly for younger children and those with greater disease severity."

This comprehensive review explores the multifaceted roles of TDP-43 in both physiological and pathological contexts. We delve into TDP-43's crucial functions in RNA metabolism, including splicing regulation, mRNA stability, and miRNA biogenesis. Particular emphasis is placed on recent discoveries regarding TDP-43's involvement in DNA interactions and chromatin dynamics, highlighting its broader impact on gene expression and genome stability. The review also examines the complex pathogenesis of TDP-43-related disorders, discussing the protein's propensity for aggregation, its effects on mitochondrial function, and its non-cell autonomous impacts on glial cells. We provide an in-depth analysis of TDP-43 pathology across various neurodegenerative conditions, from well-established associations in ALS and FTLD to emerging roles in diseases such as Huntington's disease and Niemann-Pick C disease. The potential of TDP-43 as a therapeutic target is explored, with a focus on recent developments in targeting cryptic exon inclusion and other TDP-43-mediated processes. This review synthesizes current knowledge on TDP-43 biology and pathology, offering insights into the protein's central role in neurodegeneration and highlighting promising avenues for future research and therapeutic interventions."

This mutant huntingtin protein (mHTT) with extended polyQ forms aggregates in cortical and striatal neurons, causing cell damage and death. The retina is part of the central nervous system (CNS), and visual deficits and structural abnormalities in the retina of HD patients have been observed. Defects in retinal structure and function are also present in the R6/2 and R6/1 HD transgenic mouse models that contain a gene fragment to express mHTTex1. We investigated whether these defects extend to the zQ175KI mouse model which is thought to be more representative of the human condition because it was engineered to contain the extended CAG repeat within the endogenous HTT locus. We found qualitatively similar phenotypes between R6/1 and zQ175KI retinae that include the presence of mHTT aggregates in retinal neurons, cone loss, downregulation of rod signaling proteins and abnormally elongated photoreceptor connecting cilia. In addition, we present novel findings that mHTT disrupts cell polarity in the photoreceptor cell layer and the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Furthermore, we show that the RPE cells from R6/1 mice contain mHTT nuclear inclusions, adding to the list of non-neuronal cells with mHTT aggregates and pathology. Thus, the eye may serve as a useful system to track disease progression and to test therapeutic intervention strategies for HD."

    "abstract": "Very rarely, adult NMDAR antibody-associated encephalitis (NMDAR-E) leads to persistent cerebellar atrophy and ataxia. Transient cerebellar ataxia is common in pediatric NMDAR-E. Immune-mediated cerebellar ataxia may be associated with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG), aquaporin-4 (AQP-4), kelch-like family member 11 (KLHL11), and glutamate kainate receptor subunit 2 (GluK2) antibodies, all of which may co-occur in NMDAR-E. Here, we aimed to investigate the frequency, long-term outcome, and immunological concomitants of ataxia in NMDAR-E. In this observational study, patients with definite NMDAR-E with a follow-up of >12 months were recruited from the GENERATE registry. Cases with documented ataxia were analyzed in detail. In 12 of 62 patients (19%), ataxia was documented. Bilateral cerebellar ataxia without additional focal CNS findings was found in four (one child and three adults); one of these was previously reported as a case with persistent cerebellar atrophy and ataxia. Two patients with bilateral cerebellar ataxia had additional focal neurological symptoms, optic neuritis and facial palsy. Two patients developed hemiataxia: one with diplopia suggesting brainstem dysfunction and the other probably resulting from cerebellar diaschisis due to contralateral status epilepticus. In all but the one developing cerebellar atrophy, cerebellar ataxia was transient and not associated with a worse long-term outcome. In all five patients with cerebellar ataxia tested, MOG, AQP-4, GluK2, and KLHL11 antibodies were negative. In two additional patients negative for both MOG and AQP-4 antibodies, ataxia was sensory and explained by cervical myelitis as part of multiple sclerosis (MS) manifesting temporal relation to NMDAR-E. One of the patients with bilateral ataxia with focal neurological deficits was also diagnosed with MS upon follow-up. Finally, in two patients, ataxia was explained by cerebral hypoxic damage following circulatory failure during an ICU stay with severe NMDAR-E. Ataxia of different types is quite common in NMDAR-E. Cerebellar ataxia in NMDAR-E is mostly transient. NMDAR-E followed by persistent ataxia and cerebellar atrophy is very rare. Cerebellar ataxia in NMDAR-E may not be explained by concomitant KLHL11, MOG, AQP-4, or GluK2 autoimmunity. Of note, ataxia in NMDAR-E may result from treatment complications and, most interestingly, from MS manifesting in temporal association with NMDAR-E."

    "abstract": "Long-acting injectable formulation of cabotegravir/rilpivirine (CAB/RPV) is a promising novel maintenance therapy for HIV infection. However, coinfection with active hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a contraindication to initiating this therapy. Despite guidelines, patients with HBV immunity can still contract acute HBV infection. We report a case of a 30-year-old man with HIV who transitioned from antiretroviral therapy to CAB/RPV and had confirmed HBV immunity. The patient, though asymptomatic, showed significantly elevated liver function tests (LFTs) before his monthly CAB/RPV injection. He was hospitalized and diagnosed with acute HBV infection. His LFTs improved, and he was taken off CAB/RPV and returned to antiretroviral therapy for the treatment of HIV and HBV. During subsequent follow-ups as an outpatient, the patient's LFTs normalized, and his HBV viral load significantly decreased. This case highlights the potential need for routine HBV testing in patients on CAB/RPV therapy."

This study aimed to develop and validate the Korean version of the HDQoL-C (K-HDQoL-C) to assess the burden on Korean caregivers of Huntington's disease (HD) patients. A total of 19 HD caregivers (7 females, mean age 55.4±14.6 years) participated in this study. The K-HDQoL-C, a translation of the English version, consisted of demographic information, caring aspects, life satisfaction, and feelings about life. It was administered twice, 2 weeks apart. Internal consistency was evaluated using Cronbach's α, and test-retest reliability was assessed with intraclass correlation coefficients. The relationship with the Zarit Burden Interview-12 (ZBI-12) was analyzed. The internal consistencies of the K-HDQoL-C were 0.771 (part 2), 0.938 (part 3), and 0.891 (part 4). The test-retest reliability ranged from 0.908 to 0.936. Part 3 was negatively correlated with the ZBI-12, and part 4 was positively correlated with the ZBI-12 (r=-0.780, 0.923; p<0.001). The K-HDQoL-C effectively evaluates the challenges faced by HD caregivers, particularly in terms of care aspects and life satisfaction."

    "title": "Location of polyglutamine track affects pathogenic threshold of polyglutamine expansion diseases - Importance of association with the proteasome.",
    "abstract": "The expansion of glutamine residue track (polyQ) within soluble proteins (Q proteins) is responsible for nine autosomal-dominant genetic neurodegenerative disorders. These disorders develop when polyQ expansion exceeds a specific pathogenic threshold (Q<sub>th</sub>) which is unique for each disease. However, the pathogenic mechanisms associated with the variability of Q<sub>th</sub> within the family of Q proteins are poorly understood. In the previous publication we proposed that polarity of the regions flanking polyQ track in each protein plays a key role in defining Q<sub>th</sub> value (Kim, M. Mol Neurodegener 9 (2014) 45) and that these effects can be explained as a result of interactions between polyQ-expanded protein and proteasome (Kim, M Bezprozvanny, I (2021). Biochem Biophys Res Commun 536:95-99). In the present manuscript we extended our analysis and analyzed effects of location of polyQ-expanded track within the protein sequence. To accomplish this, we divided a family of polyQ-expanded proteins into 3 classes - G1, G2 and G3 groups, which differ by position of polyQ-expanded track in the protein sequence. We determined that polarity of flanking regions have different effect on Q<sub>th.</sub> value for each of these classes, and explained these differences by mechanistic analysis of proteasomal function. Our results further support the hypothesis that differences in Q<sub>th.</sub> values of pathogenic threshold can be explained by different mode of interactions between polyQ-flanking regions and proteasome and these findings provide novel insight into pathogenic mechanisms of polyQ-expanded disorders."

    "abstract": "Chorea is a motor manifestation of Huntington's disease (HD), which can lead to decreased functional independence and falls. Even though multiple classes of medications have been used to treat this symptom, only the vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) inhibitors tetrabenazine, deutetrabenazine, and valbenazine have been approved by the FDA for this indication. This article reviews the pharmacological properties, clinical efficacy, safety, and tolerability of valbenazine in the treatment of chorea in HD. Key considerations in the concomitant use of VMAT2 inhibitors with other medications are discussed, particularly considerations specific to valbenazine use plus medications often used to treat neuropsychiatric symptoms in HD. Valbenazine effectively addresses chorea. Its selectivity avoids VMAT1-related side effects and tardive dyskinesia and may result in less off-target side effects such as parkinsonism, behavioral changes, and akathisia. The cost of this medication could be a barrier to access, even for those with insurance, due to high co-pay fees. Head-to-head clinical trials are needed to compare valbenazine's efficacy with the other approved drugs for chorea in HD."

    "abstract": "Huntington's disease (HD) is a rare neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expansion of the CAG trinucleotide repeat in the huntingtin gene which encodes the mutant huntingtin protein (mHTT) that is associated with HD-related neuropathophysiology. Noninvasive visualization of mHTT aggregates in the brain, with positron emission tomography (PET), will allow to reliably evaluate the efficacy of therapeutic interventions in HD. This study aimed to assess the radiation burden of [<sup>18</sup>F]CHDI-650, a novel fluorinated mHTT radioligand, in humans based on both in vivo and ex vivo biodistribution in mice and subsequent determination of dosimetry for dosing in humans. Wild-type male and female CD-1 Swiss mice (n = 15/sex) were used to assess in vivo PET imaging-based and ex vivo biodistribution-based tracer distribution of [<sup>18</sup>F]CHDI-650 at 30-, 60-, 120-, 240- and 360-min post-injection. Three-dimensional volumes of interest of the organs were drawn on the co-registered PET/CT image and organs were collected after dissection. Organ radioactivity levels were determined using both modalities. The residence time was calculated and extrapolated to human phantoms. The absorbed and effective doses were computed with OLINDA/EXM 2.2 and IDAC-Dose2.1. Ex vivo and PET-imaging biodistribution of [<sup>18</sup>F]CHDI-650 showed rapid washout after 30 min in most of the organs with the highest uptake in the gallbladder and urine in mice. Extrapolation of the data to human phantoms with OLINDA showed a total mean in vivo based effective dose of 21.7 μSv/MBq with the highest equivalent organ dose in the urinary bladder wall (4.52 μSv/MBq). The total mean ex vivo based effective dose was calculated to be 20.6 μSv/MBq. The highest equivalent organ dose ex vivo in the urinary bladder wall was estimated to be 4.22 μSv/MBq. The predicted exposure in humans using IDAC-Dose correlated well to those obtained with OLINDA for both in vivo and ex vivo measurements (r = 0.9320 and r = 0.9368, respectively). Dosimetry analysis indicated absorbed and effective doses of [<sup>18</sup>F]CHDI-650 are well below the recommended limits, suggesting that the radioligand is suitable for clinical assessment. Based on the highest effective dose estimates, an injection of 370 MBq in humans would result in a radiation dose of 8.03 mSv."

    "abstract": "The innate immune response aims to prevent pathogens from entering the organism and/or to facilitate pathogen clearance. Innate immune cells, such as macrophages, mast cells (MCs), natural killer cells and neutrophils, bear pattern recognition receptors and are thus able to recognize common molecular patterns, such as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), the later occurring in the context of neuroinflammation. An inflammatory component in the pathology of otherwise \"primary cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative\" disease has recently been recognized and targeted as a means of therapeutic intervention. Activated MCs are multifunctional effector cells generated from hematopoietic stem cells that, together with dendritic cells, represent first-line immune defense mechanisms against pathogens and/or tissue destruction. This review aims to summarize evidence of MC implication in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, namely, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington's disease, and multiple sclerosis. In view of recent evidence that the gut-brain axis may be implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases and the characterization of the neuroinflammatory component in the pathology of these diseases, this review also focuses on MCs as potential mediators in the gut-brain axis bi-directional communication and the possible role of <i>Helicobacter pylori</i>, a gastric pathogen known to alter the gut-brain axis homeostasis towards local and systemic pro-inflammatory responses. As MCs and <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> infection may offer targets of intervention with potential therapeutic implications for neurodegenerative disease, more clinical and translational evidence is needed to elucidate this field."

    "abstract": "Huntington's disease (HD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative disorder characterized by severe motor deficits, cognitive decline and psychiatric disturbances. An early and significant morphological hallmark of HD is the activation of astrocytes triggered by mutant huntingtin, leading to the release of inflammatory mediators. Fingolimod (FTY), an FDA-approved sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor agonist is used to treat multiple sclerosis (MS), a neuroinflammatory disease, and has shown therapeutic promise in other neurological conditions. Our study aimed to investigate the therapeutic potential of FTY for treating HD by utilizing a well-characterized mouse model of HD (zQ175dn) and wild-type littermates. The study design included a crossover, long-term oral treatment with 1 mg/kg to 2 mg/kg FTY from the age of 15-46 weeks (n = 128). Different motor behavior and physiological parameters were assessed throughout the study. The findings revealed that FTY rescued disease-related body weight loss in a sex-dependent manner, indicating its potential to regulate metabolic disturbances and to counteract neurodegenerative processes in HD. FTY intervention also rescued testicular atrophy, restored testis tissue structure in male mice suggesting a broader impact on peripheral tissues affected by huntingtin pathology. Histological analyses of the brain revealed delayed accumulation of activated astrocytes contributing to the preservation of the neural microenvironment by reducing neuroinflammation. The extent of FTY-related disease improvement was sex-dependent. Motor functions and body weight improved mostly in female mice with sustained estrogen levels, whereas males had to compensate for the ongoing, disease-related testis atrophy and the loss of androgen production. Our study underscores the beneficial therapeutic effects of FTY on HD involving endogenous steroid hormones and their important anabolic effects. It positions FTY as a promising candidate for therapeutic interventions targeting various aspects of HD pathology. Further studies are needed to fully evaluate its therapeutic potential in patients."

A survey of patent publications from 2018 to present, taken from Google Scholar, Espanet, Web of Science, Drugbank, Scopus, or PubMed is analyzed. The authors suggest that (i) numerous areas of biology-pharmacology need to be considered: selectivity, in vivo studies, toxicity, bioavailability, and drug-likeness, the mechanism of action in different animals and humans, evaluation of more efficient and selective biological tests; (ii) synthetic method outbalance in the discovery and production of ALOX inhibitors with greater selectivity. Several ALOX inhibitors show promising results for the treatment of neurological disorders. Their clinical evaluation will be critical to assess therapeutic utility.

    "abstract": "Altered balance between striatal direct and indirect pathways contributes to early motor, cognitive and psychiatric symptoms in Huntington disease (HD). While degeneration of striatal D2-type dopamine receptor (D2)-expressing indirect pathway medium spiny neurons (iMSNs) occurs prior to that of D1-type dopamine receptor (D1)-expressing direct pathway neurons, altered corticostriatal synaptic function precedes degeneration. D2-mediated signaling on iMSNs reduces their excitability and promotes endocannabinoid (eCB) synthesis, suppressing glutamate release from cortical afferents. D2 receptors are also expressed on glutamatergic cortical terminals, cholinergic interneurons, and dopaminergic terminals from substantia nigra where they suppress release of glutamate, acetylcholine and dopamine, respectively, and these cell types may contribute to early striatal dysfunction in HD. Thus, we used corticostriatal brain slices and optogenetic probes to directly investigate neuromodulatory signaling in the transgenic YAC128 HD mouse model. Low-dose D2 agonist quinpirole reduced cortically-evoked glutamate release in dorsal striatum of premanifest YAC128 slices but not WT, and blocking type 1 cannabinoid receptors mitigated this effect. YAC128 corticostriatal brain slices also showed increased evoked dopamine and reduced evoked eCB release compared to WT, while acetylcholine signaling patterns remained relatively intact. These findings suggest that YAC128 corticostriatal slices show increased D2 sensitivity that is eCB-dependent, and that dopamine and eCB release are altered at an early disease stage. We provide evidence for impaired neuromodulatory signaling in early HD, guiding therapeutic efforts prior to the onset of overt motor symptoms later on."

    "abstract": "Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder traditionally characterized by the selective loss of medium spiny neurons in the basal ganglia. However, it has become apparent that white matter injury and oligodendrocyte dysfunction precede the degeneration of medium spiny neurons, garnering interest as a key pathogenic mechanism of HD. Oligodendrocytes are glial cells found within the central nervous system involved in the production of myelin and the myelination of axons. Myelin is a lipid-rich sheath that wraps around axons, facilitating signal conduction and neuronal viability. The degeneration of myelin hinders effective communication and leaves neurons vulnerable to external damage and subsequent degeneration. Abnormalities in oligodendrocyte maturation have been established in the HD human brain, however, investigations into the underlying dysfunction of human oligodendrocytes in HD are limited. This review will detail the involvement of oligodendrocytes and white matter damage in HD. Recent developments in modeling human-specific oligodendrocyte pathology in HD will be discussed, with a particular focus on emerging somatic cell reprogramming approaches."

    "title": "Mutant huntingtin protein decreases with CAG repeat expansion: implications for therapeutics and bioassays.",
    "abstract": "Huntington's disease is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG repeat expansion that encodes a polyglutamine tract in the huntingtin (HTT) protein. The mutant CAG repeat is unstable and expands in specific brain cells and peripheral tissues throughout life. Genes involved in the DNA mismatch repair pathways, known to act on expansion, have been identified as genetic modifiers; therefore, it is the rate of somatic CAG repeat expansion that drives the age of onset and rate of disease progression. In the context of an expanded CAG repeat, the <i>HTT</i> pre-mRNA can be alternatively processed to generate the <i>HTT1a</i> transcript that encodes the aggregation prone and highly pathogenic HTT1a protein. This may be a mechanism through which somatic CAG repeat expansion exerts its pathogenic effects, as the longer the CAG repeat, the more <i>HTT1a</i> and HTT1a is produced. The allelic series of knock-in mouse models, <i>Hdh</i>Q20, <i>Hdh</i>Q50, <i>Hdh</i>Q80, <i>Hdh</i>Q111, CAG140 and zQ175 with polyglutamine expansions of 20, 50, 80, 111, 140 and ∼190, can be used to model the molecular and cellular consequences of CAG repeat expansion within a single neuron. By western blot of cortical lysates, we found that mutant HTT levels decreased with increasing CAG repeat length; mutant HTT was only 23 and 10% of wild-type levels in CAG140 and zQ175 cortices, respectively. To identify the optimal bioassays for detecting the full-length HTT and HTT1a isoforms, we interrogated the pairwise combinations of seven well-characterized antibodies on both the 'homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence' and 'Meso Scale Discovery' platforms. We tested 32 assays on each platform to detect 'full-length mutant HTT', HTT1a, 'total mutant HTT' (full-length HTT and HTT1a) and 'total full-length HTT' (mutant and wild type). None of these assays recapitulated the full-length mutant HTT levels as measured by western blot. We recommend using isoform- and species-specific assays that detect full-length mutant HTT, HTT1a or wild-type HTT as opposed to those that detect more than one isoform simultaneously. Our finding that as the CAG repeat expands, full-length mutant HTT levels decrease, while <i>HTT1a</i> and HTT1a levels increase has implications for therapeutic strategies. If mutant HTT levels in cells containing (CAG)<sub>200</sub> are only 10% of wild-type, HTT-lowering strategies targeting full-length <i>HTT</i> at sequences 3' to Intron 1 <i>HTT</i> will predominantly lower wild-type HTT, as mutant HTT levels in these cells are already depleted. These data support a therapeutic strategy that lowers <i>HTT1a</i> and depletes levels of the HTT1a protein."

Here, we combine the advantages of NIR and multiphoton imaging by developing a dual-infrared two-photon microscope to enable high-resolution deep imaging in biological tissues. We first computationally identify that photon absorption, as opposed to scattering, is the primary contributor to signal attenuation. We next construct a NIR two-photon microscope with a 1640 nm femtosecond pulsed laser and a NIR PMT detector to image biological tissues labeled with fluorescent single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs). We achieve spatial imaging resolutions close to the Abbe resolution limit and eliminate blur and background autofluorescence of biomolecules, 300 μm deep into brain slices and through the full 120 μm thickness of a <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> leaf. We also demonstrate that NIR-II two-photon microscopy can measure tissue heterogeneity by quantifying how much the fluorescence power law function varies across tissues, a feature we exploit to distinguish Huntington's Disease afflicted mouse brain tissues from wildtype. Our results suggest dual-infrared two-photon microscopy could accomplish in-tissue structural imaging and biochemical sensing with a minimal background, and with high spatial resolution, in optically opaque or highly autofluorescent biological tissues."

Volumes of hypothalamic structures were obtained from 3T structural magnetic resonance images through an automatic parcellation procedure (FastSurfer-HypVINN). The standardised cognitive domain scores were derived from extensive neuropsychological test batteries. We employed multivariable linear regression to assess associations of hypothalamic volumes with age, sex and cognitive performance. In older individuals, volumes of total, anterior and posterior hypothalamus, and mammillary bodies were smaller, while those of medial hypothalamus and tuberal region were larger. Larger medial hypothalamus volume was related to higher cortisol levels in older individuals, providing functional validation. Volumes of all hypothalamic structures were larger in men compared to women. In both sexes, larger volumes of total, anterior and posterior hypothalamus, and mammillary bodies were associated with better domain-specific cognitive performance, whereas larger volumes of medial hypothalamus and tuberal region were associated with worse domain-specific cognitive performance. We found strong age and sex effects on hypothalamic structures, as well as robust associations between these structures and domain-specific cognitive functions. Overall, these findings thus implicate specific hypothalamic subregions as potential therapeutic targets against age-associated cognitive decline.

    "abstract": "Neurodegeneration refers to the gradual loss of neurons and extensive changes in glial cells like tau inclusions in astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, α-synuclein inclusions in oligodendrocytes and SOD1 aggregates in astrocytes along with deterioration in the motor, cognition, learning, and behavior. Common neurodegenerative disorders are Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Huntington's disease (HD), spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA), and supranuclear palsy. There is a lack of effective treatment for neurodegenerative diseases, and scientists are putting their efforts into developing therapies against them. Stem cell therapy has emerged as a hope for neurodegenerative disorders since it is not only the damaged neurons that might be replaced, but other neuromodulators and neuroprotectors are secreted. Stem cell terminal differentiation before implantation ensures the implantation of correct cells and molecular markers like carbonic anhydrase II, CNPase (2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphohydrolase), myelin basic protein (MBP), and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) elucidate the differentiation. Secretion of various growth factors like epidermal growth factor (EGF), keratinocyte growth factor (KGF), vascular endothelial growth factor-α (VEGF-α), transforming growth factor (TGF), and macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP) supports cell survival, cell proliferation, blood vessel formation, axon regeneration, and neuroglial functional connection formation at the site of degeneration. Adverse effects of stem cell therapy, like teratogenicity and differentiation in different cells other than the desired one under the influence of microenvironment, are a few key concerns. Post-transplantation improved synaptic plasticity, apoptosis inhibition, and reduction in tau-phosphorylation and amyloid beta (Aβ) production has been observed in Alzheimer's patients. A large number of experimental, preclinical, and clinical studies have been conducted, and encouraging results have been obtained. The present review exhaustively discusses various kinds of stem cells, their usage in treating neurodegenerative disorders, limitations and challenges, and ethical issues related to stem cell therapy."

TGD people of color and low-income TGD people experience intersecting discrimination that may compound chronic conditions and disability. To our knowledge, no research has focused on chronic conditions among TGD Medicare beneficiaries with disabilities. We compared the probability of chronic conditions among TGD adults with disability-based eligibility for Medicare across race, ethnicity, and dual Medicaid-Medicare enrollment. We used cross-sectional Medicare enrollment and claims data between 2008 and 2017 for fee-for-service beneficiaries eligible based on disability. We applied a claims-based algorithm to identify TGD beneficiaries. We assessed differences in beneficiaries' age-adjusted predicted probability of chronic conditions across race, ethnicity, and dual eligibility. Dual-eligible TGD beneficiaries (N = 8041) had a higher predicted probability of nine out of ten health condition categories relative to Medicare-only TGD beneficiaries (N = 6237). For each race and ethnicity category, the most prevalent condition categories were mental health, cardiovascular conditions, and non-cardiovascular-related physical health conditions. Hispanic and non-Hispanic Black TGD beneficiaries had over two and three times the probability of infectious disease as non-Hispanic White TGD beneficiaries, respectively. TGD adults with disabilities have high rates of chronic conditions with additional disparities by race, ethnicity, and dual eligibility status. Our findings offer potential directions for mixed-methods and intervention research aimed at identifying and ameliorating the drivers of these disparities among TGD Medicare beneficiaries with disabilities."

    "title": "Pharmacology, Signaling and Therapeutic Potential of Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor 5 Negative Allosteric Modulators.",
    "abstract": "Metabotropic glutamate receptors are a family of eight class C G protein-coupled receptors regulating higher order brain functions including cognition and motion. Metabotropic glutamate receptors have thus been heavily investigated as potential drug targets for treating neurological disorders. Drug discovery efforts directed toward metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 5 (mGlu<sub>5</sub>) have been particularly fruitful, with a wealth of drug candidates and pharmacological tools identified. mGlu<sub>5</sub> negative allosteric modulators (NAMs) are promising novel therapeutics for developmental, neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders (e.g., Alzheimer's Disease, Huntington's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, autism spectrum disorders, substance use disorders, stroke, anxiety and depression) and show promise in ameliorating adverse effects induced by other medications (e.g., L-dopa induced dyskinesia in Parkinson's Disease). However, despite preclinical success, mGlu<sub>5</sub> NAMs are yet to reach the market due to poor safety and efficacy profiles in clinical trials. Herein, we review the physiology and signal transduction of mGlu<sub>5</sub>. We provide a comprehensive critique of therapeutic options with respect to mGlu5 inhibitors, spanning from orthosteric antagonists to NAMs. Finally, we address the challenges associated with drug development and highlight future directions to guide rational drug discovery of safe and effective novel therapeutics."

    "abstract": "We used our mouse papillomavirus (MmuPV1) model to test the hypothesis that two primary psychoactive ingredients of marijuana, Δ<sup>9</sup>-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD), promote papillomavirus persistence in the oral mucosa of infected mice. We conducted intraperitoneal (ip) injections of a moderate dose (3 mg/kg) of either CBD and/or THC in both male and female athymic nude mice and followed the mice up to 20 weeks post-infection. These doses are comparable to what is estimated for human conventional cannabis consumption. All mice were infected with MmuPV1 in the oral cavity at week 4 post-ip delivery of CBD, THC, or a combination of THC and CBD (T + C). THC and CBD were detected in the blood of treated mice for up to 72 h after ip injection. Significantly higher levels of viral DNA were detected in males from both CBD and T + C-treated groups compared to those in the control group at 9- 10-and 12-weeks post infection. A marginally increased viral RNA was also detected in the infected tongues of males in all tested groups compared to that in males in the vehicle control group; the opposite was observed in females. We detected significantly higher levels of dermal dendritic cells (CD205<sup>+</sup>CD11c<sup>+</sup>), granulocytes (Ly6G<sup>+</sup>), but macrophages (F4-80+) recruited to the infected tongues of CBD-treated females. Our findings suggest that CBD may play a role in promoting MmuPV1 persistence in the oral cavity."

    "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), characterized by intermittent hypoxia (IH), and is associated with increased cardiovascular mortality that may not be reduced by standard therapies. Inappropriate activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system occurs in IH, and mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) blockade has been shown to improve vascular outcomes in cardiovascular disease. Thus, we hypothesized that MR inhibition prevents coronary and renal vascular dysfunction in mice exposed to chronic IH. Human and mouse coronary vascular cells and male C57BL/6J mice were exposed to IH or room air (RA) for 12 hours/day for 3 days (in vitro) and 6 weeks with or without treatments with spironolactone (SPL) or hydrochlorothiazide (HTZ). In vitro studies demonstrated that IH increased MR gene expression in human and mouse coronary artery endothelial and smooth muscle cells. Exposure to IH in mice increased blood pressure, reduced coronary flow velocity reserve (CFVR), and attenuated endothelium-dependent dilation and enhanced vasoconstrictor responsiveness in coronary, but not renal arteries. Importantly, SPL treatment prevented altered coronary vascular function independent of blood pressure as normalization of BP with HTZ did not improve CFVR or coronary vasomotor function. These data demonstrate that chronic IH, which mimics the hypoxia-reoxygenation cycles of moderate-to-severe OSA, increases coronary vascular MR expression in vitro. It also selectively promotes coronary vascular dysfunction in mice. Importantly, this dysfunction is sensitive to MR antagonism by SPL, independent of blood pressure. These findings suggest that MR blockade could serve as an adjuvant therapy to improve long-term cardiovascular outcomes in patients with OSA."

    "abstract": "Neurological disorders, encompassing conditions such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), pose a significant global health challenge, affecting millions worldwide. With an aging population and increased life expectancy, the prevalence of these disorders is escalating rapidly, leading to substantial economic burdens exceeding trillions of dollars annually. Animal models play a crucial role in understanding the underlying mechanisms of these disorders and developing effective treatments. Various species, including rodents, non-human primates, and fruit flies, are utilized to replicate specific aspects of human neurological conditions. However, selecting the ideal animal model requires careful consideration of its proximity to human disease conditions and its ability to mimic disease pathobiology and pharmacological responses. An Animal Model Quality Assessment (AMQA) tool has been developed to facilitate this selection process, focusing on assessing models based on their similarity to human conditions and disease pathobiology. Therefore, integrating intrinsic and extrinsic factors linked to the disease into the study's objectives aids in constructing a biological information matrix for comparing disease progression between the animal model and human disease. Ultimately, selecting an ideal animal disease model depends on its predictive, face, and construct validity, ensuring relevance and reliability in translational research efforts."

    "title": "Calcium Ions in the Physiology and Pathology of the Central Nervous System.",
    "abstract": "Calcium ions play a key role in the physiological processes of the central nervous system. The intracellular calcium signal, in nerve cells, is part of the neurotransmission mechanism. They are responsible for stabilizing membrane potential and controlling the excitability of neurons. Calcium ions are a universal second messenger that participates in depolarizing signal transduction and contributes to synaptic activity. These ions take an active part in the mechanisms related to memory and learning. As a result of depolarization of the plasma membrane or stimulation of receptors, there is an extracellular influx of calcium ions into the cytosol or mobilization of these cations inside the cell, which increases the concentration of these ions in neurons. The influx of calcium ions into neurons occurs via plasma membrane receptors and voltage-dependent ion channels. Calcium channels play a key role in the functioning of the nervous system, regulating, among others, neuronal depolarization and neurotransmitter release. Channelopathies are groups of diseases resulting from mutations in genes encoding ion channel subunits, observed including the pathophysiology of neurological diseases such as migraine. A disturbed ability of neurons to maintain an appropriate level of calcium ions is also observed in such neurodegenerative processes as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and epilepsy. This review focuses on the involvement of calcium ions in physiological and pathological processes of the central nervous system. We also consider the use of calcium ions as a target for pharmacotherapy in the future."

    "title": "Decoding Neurodegeneration: A Review of Molecular Mechanisms and Therapeutic Advances in Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and ALS.",
    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, ALS, and Huntington's, remain formidable challenges in medicine, with their relentless progression and limited therapeutic options. These diseases arise from a web of molecular disturbances-misfolded proteins, chronic neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and genetic mutations-that slowly dismantle neuronal integrity. Yet, recent scientific breakthroughs are opening new paths to intervene in these once-intractable conditions. This review synthesizes the latest insights into the underlying molecular dynamics of neurodegeneration, revealing how intertwined pathways drive the course of these diseases. With an eye on the most promising advances, we explore innovative therapies emerging from cutting-edge research: nanotechnology-based drug delivery systems capable of navigating the blood-brain barrier, gene-editing tools like CRISPR designed to correct harmful genetic variants, and stem cell strategies that not only replace lost neurons but foster neuroprotective environments. Pharmacogenomics is reshaping treatment personalization, enabling tailored therapies that align with individual genetic profiles, while molecular diagnostics and biomarkers are ushering in an era of early, precise disease detection. Furthermore, novel perspectives on the gut-brain axis are sparking interest as mounting evidence suggests that microbiome modulation may play a role in reducing neuroinflammatory responses linked to neurodegenerative progression. Taken together, these advances signal a shift toward a comprehensive, personalized approach that could transform neurodegenerative care. By integrating molecular insights and innovative therapeutic techniques, this review offers a forward-looking perspective on a future where treatments aim not just to manage symptoms but to fundamentally alter disease progression, presenting renewed hope for improved patient outcomes."

    "abstract": "A common hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases is the accumulation of polypeptide aggregates in neurons. Despite the primary cause of these diseases being inherently genetic, their development can be delayed with proper preventive treatments. Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (ω-3 LCPUFA) are promising bioactive nutrients that are beneficial for brain health. In this study, the impact of an oil rich in a structured form of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) triglyceride (TG) was assessed in a <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> model expressing long poly-glutamine (polyQ) chains, which mimics the symptomatology of polyQ-related neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington's disease (HD), among others. The lifespan, the motility, the number of polyQ aggregates, the oxidative stress resistance, and the cognitive performance associated with sensitive stimuli was measured in mutant nematodes with polyQ aggregates. Overall, DHA-TG at 0.5 µM improved the lifespan, the motility, the oxidative stress resistance, and the cognitive performance of the nematodes, emphasizing the protection against serotonergic synapse dysfunction. Furthermore, the treatment reduced the polyQ aggregates in the nematodes. The data described herein shed light on the connection between DHA and the cognitive performance in neurodegenerative diseases and demonstrated the potential of DHA-TG as nutritional co-adjuvant to prevent the development of polyQ-associated dysfunctions."

    "abstract": "This review explores recent advancements in gene therapy as a potential treatment for neurodegenerative diseases, focusing on intervention mechanisms, administration routes, and associated limitations. Following the PRISMA procedure guidelines, we systematically analyzed studies published since 2020 using the PICO framework to derive reliable conclusions. The efficacy of various gene therapies was evaluated for Parkinson's disease (n = 12), spinal muscular atrophy (n = 8), Huntington's disease (n = 3), Alzheimer's disease (n = 3), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (n = 6). For each condition, we assessed the therapeutic approach, curative or disease-modifying potential, delivery methods, advantages, drawbacks, and side effects. Results indicate that gene therapies targeting specific genes are particularly effective in monogenic disorders, with promising clinical outcomes expected in the near future. In contrast, in polygenic diseases, therapies primarily aim to promote cell survival. A major challenge remains: the translation of animal model success to human clinical application. Additionally, while intracerebral delivery methods enhance therapeutic efficacy, they are highly invasive. Despite these hurdles, gene therapy represents a promising frontier in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, underscoring the need for continued research to refine and personalize treatments for each condition."

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and Huntington's disease (HD) have become a major global health burden, but the detailed pathogeneses of neurodegenerative diseases are still unknown, and current treatments are mainly aimed at controlling symptoms; there are no curative treatments for neurodegenerative diseases or treatments for the progressive cognitive, behavioral, and functional impairments that they cause. Studies have shown that some plant extracts with pungent flavor components have a certain neuroprotective effect in neurodegenerative diseases, and their mechanisms mainly involve inhibiting neuronal apoptosis, promoting neuronal regeneration, reducing mitochondrial degeneration, and reducing the production of oxides such as reactive oxygen species in cells, which are of great significance for exploring the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we searched the PubMed database for relevant literature collected in the past 15 years. Finally, we summarized the protective effects of pungent flavor components such as capsaicin, piperine, curcumin, cannabinoids, allicin, and nicotine on the nervous system, focusing on the molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways that they activate. In addition, we also compiled and summarized the laboratory experiments, preclinical experiments, and effects of various pungent flavor components in neurodegenerative diseases. The goal is to further explore their potential as effective drugs for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases and provide new ideas for further research on the specific protective mechanisms of these substances for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases and the targets of drug action in the future."

    "abstract": "Autophagy is a degradation process whose activation underlies beneficial effects of caloric restriction. Isothiocyanates (ITCs) induce autophagy in cancer cells, however, their impact on primary cells remains insufficiently explored, particularly in non-epithelial cells. The aim of this study was to investigate whether ITCs induce autophagy in primary (non-immortalized) mesenchymal cells and if so, to determine the molecular mechanism underlying its activation and consequences on cell functioning. Primary human dermal fibroblasts (HDFa) and prostate cancer cells (PC3) as well as two ITCs, sulforaphane and phenethyl isothiocyanate, were applied. Cell viability was measured by the MTT test, protein synthesis - by <sup>3</sup>H-leucine incorporation, and protein level - by immunoblotting. A number of mutant huntingtin (mHtt) aggregates was assessed by fluorescence microscopy. Both ITCs efficiently induced autophagy in fibroblasts which coincided with suppression of mTORC1 - a negative autophagy regulator - and protein synthesis arrest. A dephosphorylation of mTORC1 substrate, S6K1, and ribosomal S6 protein was preceded by activation of AMPK, an inhibitor of mTORC1 and autophagy activator. A similar response was observed in phenethyl isothiocyanate-treated prostate cancer cells. We also showed that ITCs-induced autophagy and/or translation block do not affect cells viability and can protect cells against an accumulation of mHtt aggregates - a main cause of Huntington's disease. Our study showed that ITCs induce autophagy and inhibit protein synthesis in both primary mesenchymal and cancer cells via modulation of the AMPK-mTORC1-S6K1 pathway. Moreover, it suggests that ITCs might have a potential in developing therapeutics for Huntington's disease."

This review explores the multifaceted impact of DNA methylation on the retina and brain during development and pathological processes. First, we investigate the role of DNA methylation in retinal development, and then focus on retinal diseases, detailing the changes in DNA methylation patterns in diseases such as diabetic retinopathy (DR), age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and glaucoma. Since the retina is considered an extension of the brain, its unique structure allows it to exhibit similar immune response mechanisms to the brain. We further extend our exploration from the retina to the brain, examining the role of DNA methylation in brain development and its associated diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Huntington's disease (HD) to better understand the mechanistic links between retinal and brain diseases, and explore the possibility of communication between the visual system and the central nervous system (CNS) from an epigenetic perspective. Additionally, we discuss neurodevelopmental brain diseases, including schizophrenia (SZ), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and intellectual disability (ID), focus on how DNA methylation affects neuronal development, synaptic plasticity, and cognitive function, providing insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying neurodevelopmental disorders."

    "title": "Genetic Diversity and Expanded Phenotypes in Dystonia: Insights from Large-Scale Exome Sequencing.",
    "abstract": "Dystonia is one of the most prevalent movement disorders, characterized by significant clinical and etiological heterogeneity. Despite considerable heritability (~25%) and the identification of several disease-linked genes, the etiology in most patients remains elusive. Moreover, understanding the correlations between clinical manifestation and genetic variants has become increasingly complex. To comprehensively unravel dystonia's genetic spectrum, we performed exome sequencing on 1,924 dystonia patients [40.3% male, 92.9% White, 93.2% isolated dystonia, median age at onset (AAO) 33 years], including 1,895 index patients, who were previously genetically unsolved. The sample was mainly based on two dystonia registries (DysTract and the Dystonia Coalition). Further, 72 additional patients of Asian ethnicity, mainly from Malaysia, were also included. We prioritized patients with negative genetic prescreening, early AAO, positive family history, and multisite involvement of dystonia. Rare variants in genes previously linked to dystonia (<i>n</i>=405) were examined. Variants were confirmed via Sanger sequencing, and segregation analysis was performed when possible. We identified 137 distinct likely pathogenic or pathogenic variants (according to ACMG criteria) across 51 genes in 163/1,924 patients [42.9% male, 85.9% White, 68.7% isolated dystonia, median AAO 19 years]. This included 153/1,895 index patients, resulting in a diagnostic yield of 8.1%. Notably, 77/137 (56.2%) of these variants were novel, with recurrent variants in <i>EIF2AK2</i>, <i>VPS16</i>, <i>KCNMA1</i>, and <i>SLC2A1</i>, and novel variant types such as two splice site variants in <i>KMT2B</i>, supported by functional evidence. Additionally, 321 index patients (16.9%) harbored variants of uncertain significance in 102 genes. The most frequently implicated genes included <i>VPS16</i>, <i>THAP1</i>, <i>GCH1</i>, <i>SGCE</i>, <i>GNAL</i>, and <i>KMT2B.</i> Presumably pathogenic variants in less well-established dystonia genes were also found, including <i>KCNMA1</i>, <i>KIF1A</i>, and <i>ZMYND11.</i> At least six variants (in <i>ADCY5</i>, <i>GNB1</i>, <i>IR2BPL, KCNN2</i>, <i>KMT2B</i>, and <i>VPS16</i>) occurred <i>de novo,</i> supporting pathogenicity. ROC curve analysis indicated that AAO and the presence of generalized dystonia were the strongest predictors of a genetic diagnosis, with diagnostic yields of 28.6% in patients with generalized dystonia and 20.4% in those with AAO < 30 years. This study provides a comprehensive examination of the genetic landscape of dystonia, revealing valuable insights into the frequency of dystonia-linked genes and their associated phenotypes. It underscores the utility of exome sequencing in establishing diagnoses within this heterogeneous condition. Despite prescreening, presumably pathogenic variants were identified in almost 10% of patients. Our findings reaffirm several dystonia candidate genes and expand the phenotypic spectrum of some of these genes to include prominent, sometimes isolated dystonia."

    "abstract": "Science-informed decisions are best guided by the objective synthesis of the totality of evidence around a particular question and assessing its trustworthiness through systematic processes. However, there are major barriers and challenges that limit science-informed food and nutrition policy, practice, and guidance. First, insufficient evidence, primarily due to acquisition cost of generating high-quality data, and the complexity of the diet-disease relationship. Furthermore, the sheer number of systematic reviews needed across the entire agriculture and food value chain, and the cost and time required to conduct them, can delay the translation of science to policy. Artificial intelligence offers the opportunity to (i) better understand the complex etiology of diet-related chronic diseases, (ii) bring more precision to our understanding of the variation among individuals in the diet-chronic disease relationship, (iii) provide new types of computed data related to the efficacy and effectiveness of nutrition/food interventions in health promotion, and (iv) automate the generation of systematic reviews that support timely decisions. These advances include the acquisition and synthesis of heterogeneous and multimodal datasets. This perspective summarizes a meeting convened at the National Academy of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. The purpose of the meeting was to examine the current state and future potential of artificial intelligence in generating new types of computed data as well as automating the generation of systematic reviews to support evidence-based food and nutrition policy, practice, and guidance."

    "title": "Navigating triplet repeats sequencing: concepts, methodological challenges and perspective for Huntington's disease.",
    "abstract": "The accurate characterization of triplet repeats, especially the overrepresented CAG repeats, is increasingly relevant for several reasons. First, germline expansion of CAG repeats above a gene-specific threshold causes multiple neurodegenerative disorders; for instance, Huntington's disease (HD) is triggered by >36 CAG repeats in the huntingtin (HTT) gene. Second, extreme expansions up to 800 CAG repeats have been found in specific cell types affected by the disease. Third, synonymous single nucleotide variants within the CAG repeat stretch influence the age of disease onset. Thus, new sequencing-based protocols that profile both the length and the exact nucleotide sequence of triplet repeats are crucial. Various strategies to enrich the target gene over the background, along with sequencing platforms and bioinformatic pipelines, are under development. This review discusses the concepts, challenges, and methodological opportunities for analyzing triplet repeats, using HD as a case study. Starting with traditional approaches, we will explore how sequencing-based methods have evolved to meet increasing scientific demands. We will also highlight experimental and bioinformatic challenges, aiming to provide a guide for accurate triplet repeat characterization for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes."

Modern pharmacological studies have revealed that Z. clinopodioides and its constituents exhibits neuroprotective effects in vitro and in vivo, and the mechanism of action is related to anti-apoptosis, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, autophagy, endoplasmic reticulum stress and so on. Currently, there is limited research on the extracts of Z. clinopodioides and their potential mechanisms of action in these neurological disorders. It is also important to prioritize research on biosynthetic pathways and chemical modification approaches to fully explore and improve the neuroprotective potential of Z. clinopodioides and its flavonoids and establish a strong foundation for its clinical applications."

    "abstract": "Trinucleotide repeats in DNA exhibit a dual nature due to their inherent instability. While their rapid expansion can diversify gene expression during evolution, exceeding a certain threshold can lead to diseases such as Huntington's disease (HD), a neurodegenerative condition, triggered by >36 C-A-G repeats in exon 1 of the Huntingtin gene. Notably, the discovery of somatic instability (SI) of the tract allows these mutations, inherited from an affected parent, to further expand throughout the patient's lifetime, resulting in a mosaic brain with specific neurons exhibiting variable and often extreme CAG lengths, ultimately leading to their death. Genome-wide association studies have identified genetic variants-both cis and trans, including mismatch repair modifiers-that modulate SI, as shown in blood cells, and influence HD's age of onset. This review will explore the evidence for SI in HD and its role in disease pathogenesis, as well as the therapeutic implications of these findings. We conclude by emphasizing the urgent need for reliable methods to quantify SI for diagnostic and prognostic purposes."

These variants are undetectable during HD genetic testing, resulting in inaccurate diagnostic reporting of uninterrupted CAG repeat length. Inaccurate reporting of CAG repeat length results in misdiagnosis of individuals with alleles near diagnostic cut-offs. We present a method to identify variant alleles during CAG repeat genotyping, allowing accurate diagnostic reporting of uninterrupted CAG repeat length. We used triplet-primed PCR (TP-PCR) to amplify <i>HTT</i> CAG repeat alleles with canonical or noncanonical repeat interruptions and leveraged differences in peak amplification patterns to develop a screening method based on peak height ratio (PHR). We used PHR to screen blood DNA from a cohort of symptomatic individuals with diagnostic CAG repeat lengths of 40 to 41. TP-PCR enables accurate reporting of uninterrupted CAG repeat length in diagnostic testing by detecting HD alleles with loss or duplication of the CAG repeat interruption. PHR screening of TP-PCR traces is a cost-effective screening method for detection, ascertainment of uninterrupted <i>HTT</i> CAG repeat length, and accurate diagnostic reporting for individuals with disease-modifying noncanonical CAG repeat interruptions."

This study aims to create and disseminate culturally and medically appropriate social media messages for Black, Latino, and American Indian or Alaska Native communities in Wisconsin and evaluate their reach and effectiveness in addressing the information needs of these communities. Our team identified relevant COVID-19 topics based on feedback from their respective community, developed lay format materials, and translated materials into culturally appropriate social media messages that community advocates delivered across their respective communities. Social media metrics (reach, engagement, and impressions) were collected using Sprout Social and Facebook Analytics. We hosted 9 focus groups with community members to learn about their social media use. These data were analyzed using an inductive approach, using NVivo software (release 1.7) to code content. Between August 2021 and January 2023, we created 980 unique social media posts that reached 88,790 individuals and gathered >6700 engagements. Average reach per post was similar across the 3 communities, despite differences in the number of posts and followers on each page: 119.46 (Latino individuals), 111.74 (Black individuals), and 113.11 (Oneida Nation members).

    "title": "Frequency and neuropathology of HTT repeat expansions in FTD/ALS: co-existence rather than causation.",
    "abstract": "While ≥ 40 CAG repeat expansions in HTT present a well-established cause of Huntington's disease (HD), an enrichment of HTT repeat expansions was recently reported also in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), including FTD/ALS patients with additional HD neuropathology. This raises the question whether the phenotypic spectrum of HTT expansions can be extended to ALS and FTD, and whether HTT should be considered as a new causative gene of FTD/ALS. If HTT repeat expansions were indeed systematically related to FTD/ALS, one would expect an increased frequency of HTT carriers in FTD/ALS, who can clinically/neuropathologically not be explained better than by the presence of the HTT repeat expansions. Screening of HTT repeat expansions in 249 consecutive patients with ALS or FTD by short-read genome sequencing took place. The post-mortem neuropathological examination was performed in the identified HTT repeat expansion carrier. One HTT repeat expansion [40/22 repeats (± 1)] was identified in an ALS patient, giving a frequency of 0.4% (1/249) (frequency in the general population: 0.03-0.18%). This patient showed a classic ALS phenotype, but no clinical or imaging signs of HD. Post-mortem brain examination revealed-in addition to ALS-typical degeneration of upper and lower motor neurons with TDP-43 inclusions-HD-typical polyQ-aggregates in gyrus cinguli, striatum and frontal lobe, yet without evidence of striatal degeneration. Our study does not support the notion of an increased frequency of HTT repeat expansions in FTD/ALS. Moreover, the phenotype of the HTT carrier identified can be better explained by two co-existent, but independent diseases: (i) ALS and (ii) presymptomatic HD, which-given the low repeat number-is likely to become manifest only later in life. These findings corroborate the concept that HTT repeat expansions are likely co-existent/coincidental, but not causative in FTD/ALS."

    "abstract": "Proper medication reconciliation (= comparing the accuracy of patient-reported medication use with pharmacy records) could prevent potentially dangerous situations such as drug-drug interactions and hospitalization. This is particularly important when patients rely on multiple medications, such as in neurodegenerative disorders like Huntington's Disease (HD). Currently, it is unknown how often medication discrepancies occur in HD patients and which factors contribute to the discrepancies. Identify prognostic factors of medication discrepancies in HD, using patient-reported medication use and local pharmacy records. With 134 pre- and manifest HD patients, we performed a multivariable logistic regression analysis with medication discrepancy as dependent variable (pharmacy records as reference value) and sex, CAP score, disease status (pre- or manifest HD), number of concomitant medications taken, presence of an informal caregiver, Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale-Total Functioning Capacity, unified cognitive Z-score and Problem Behaviors Assessment-short characteristic scores for depression, anxiety, and apathy as independent variables. Medication discrepancies were reported frequently, both in premanifest (43.2%) and manifest HD subjects (36.7%). Impaired cognition significantly predicted medication discrepancies (beta = -0.688, SE 0.27, p = 0.011). All other variables were non-significant. Regardless of HD disease status and stage, patient self-reported medication use is not a reliable source, especially in those with impaired cognitive function. The presence of an informal caregiver and the absence of polypharmacy, depression, anxiety and apathy do not influence self-reported medication accuracy. Objective verification of medication use with HD patients' local pharmacy is recommended. ICTRP-NL-OMON55123, HD-med, registered 26-Nov-2019."

    "title": "Distinct roles of ascorbic acid in extracellular vesicles and free form: Implications for metabolism and oxidative stress in presymptomatic Huntington's disease.",
    "abstract": "Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the first exon of the huntingtin gene. The huntingtin protein (Htt) is ubiquitously expressed and localized in several organelles, including endosomes, where it plays an essential role in intracellular trafficking. Presymptomatic HD is associated with a failure in energy metabolism and oxidative stress. Ascorbic acid is a potent antioxidant that plays a key role in modulating neuronal metabolism and is highly concentrated in the brain. During synaptic activity, neurons take up ascorbic acid released by glial cells; however, this process is disrupted in HD. In this study, we aim to elucidate the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying this dysfunction. Using an electrophysiological approach in presymptomatic YAC128 HD slices, we observed decreased ascorbic acid flux from astrocytes to neurons, which altered neuronal metabolic substrate preferences. Ascorbic acid efflux and recycling were also decreased in cultured astrocytes from YAC128 HD mice. We confirmed our findings using GFAP-HD160Q, an HD mice model expressing mutant N-terminal Htt mainly in astrocytes. For the first time, we demonstrated that ascorbic acid is released from astrocytes via extracellular vesicles (EVs). Decreased number of particles and exosomal markers were observed in EV fractions from cultured YAC128 HD astrocytes and Htt-KD cells. We observed reduced number of multivesicular bodies (MVBs) in YAC128 HD striatum via electron microscopy, suggesting mutant Htt alters MVB biogenesis. EVs containing ascorbic acid effectively reduced reactive oxygen species, whereas \"free\" ascorbic acid played a role in modulating neuronal metabolic substrate preferences. These findings suggest that the early redox imbalance observed in HD arises from a reduced release of ascorbic acid-containing EVs by astrocytes. Meanwhile, a decrease in \"free\" ascorbic acid likely contributes to presymptomatic metabolic impairment."

    "abstract": "Mitochondria are the seat of cellular energy and play key roles in regulating several cellular processes such as oxidative phosphorylation, respiration, calcium homeostasis and apoptotic pathways. Mitochondrial dysfunction results in error in oxidative phosphorylation, redox imbalance, mitochondrial DNA mutations, and disturbances in mitochondrial dynamics, all of which can lead to several metabolic and degenerative diseases. A plethora of studies have provided evidence for the involvement of mitochondrial dysfunction in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Hence mitochondria have been used as possible therapeutic targets in the regulation of neurodegenerative diseases. However, the double membranous structure of mitochondria poses an additional barrier to most drugs even if they are able to cross the plasma membrane. Most of the drugs acting on mitochondria also required very high doses to exhibit the desired mitochondrial accumulation and therapeutic effect which in-turn result in toxic effects. Mitochondrial targeting has been improved by direct conjugation of drugs to mitochondriotropic molecules like dequalinium (DQA) and triphenyl phosphonium (TPP) cations. But being cationic in nature, these molecules also exhibit toxicity at higher doses. In order to further improve the mitochondrial localization with minimal toxicity, TPP was conjugated with various nanomaterials like liposomes. inorganic nanoparticles, polymeric nanoparticles, micelles and dendrimers. This review provides an overview of the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases and various nanotherapeutic strategies for efficient targeting of mitochondria-acting drugs in these diseases."

    "title": "The kinase LRRK2 is required for the physiological function and expression of the glial glutamate transporter EAAT2 (SLC1A2).",
    "abstract": "Neurotransmitter transporters (NTTs) control synaptic responses by modulating the concentration of neurotransmitters at the synaptic cleft. Glutamate is the most abundant excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain and needs to be finely tuned in time and space to maintain a healthy brain and precise neurotransmission. The glutamate transporter EAAT2 (SLC1A2) is primarily responsible for glutamate clearance. EAAT2 impairment has been associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD), Huntington's disease (HD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Parkinson's disease (PD). Mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) contribute to both monogenic and sporadic forms of PD, of which the common substitution Gly2019Ser is associated with a significant deficit in EAAT2 expression. The role of pathological mutants of the LRRK2 is intensively studied and reviewed. Here we have focused the attention on the physiological role of LRRK2 on EAAT2, comparing the activity of NTTs with or without the LRRK2 kinase. By heterologous expression in Xenopus laevis oocytes and two-electrode voltage clamp, the current amplitudes of the selected NTTs and kinetic parameters have been collected in the presence and absence of LRRK2. The results show that EAAT2 expression and function are impaired in the absence of the kinase and also under its pharmacological inhibition via MLi-2 treatment. LRRK2 stabilizes EAAT2 expression increasing the amount of transporter at the plasma membrane. Interestingly, the LRRK2 action is EAAT2-specific, as we observed no significant changes in the transport current amplitude and kinetic parameters obtained for the other excitatory and inhibitory NTTs studied. This study, for the first time, demonstrates the physiological importance of LRRK2 in EAAT2 function, highlighting the specificity of LRRK2-mediated modulation of EAAT2 and suggesting a potential role for the kinase as a checkpoint for preserving neurons from excitotoxicity. In brain conditions associated with impaired glutamate clearance, targeting LRRK2 for EAAT2 regulation may offer novel therapeutic opportunities."

AGEs facilitate the onset and progression of various neurogenerative disorders due to their ability to promote cross-linking and aggregation of proteins. Further, the interaction between AGEs and receptor for AGEs (RAGE) activates neuroinflammatory, oxidative stress and excitotoxicity processes that contribute to neuronal cell death. Various therapeutic efforts have targeted lowering the production of AGEs, inhibiting RAGE or inhibiting some of the processes of the AGE-RAGE axis as potential treatments for these disorders. Whereas effective treatments for many neurodegenerative disorders remain elusive, such efforts offer promise to slow the progression of diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD) and Huntington's disease (HD)."

    "abstract": "Genetic alterations in the ERCC4 gene typically cause Xeroderma pigmentosum and other nucleotide excision repair disorders. Neurologic symptoms are present in some of these patients. In rare cases, ERCC4-mutations can manifest with prominent neurologic symptoms. We report a 62-year-old woman who presented with a movement disorder caused by a homozygous pathogenic variant in the ERCC4 gene. She presented with a hyperkinetic movement disorder (chorea) that affected the distal limbs as well as facial muscles and jaw. There was no ataxia. Extensive clinical evaluation revealed predominantly fronto-parietal and cerebellar atrophy on brain MRI with sparing of the basal ganglia and mesial temporal lobe. Iron and sparse Ca<sup>2+</sup> deposits were found in the basal ganglia. The detailed neuropsychological evaluation revealed deficits indicating subcortical-prefrontal, subcortical-parietal and frontotemporal dysfunction, without significant impairments in activities of daily living. The audiogram revealed mild age-related hearing impairment, electroneurography was unremarkable without signs of polyneuropathy. The dermatologic examination showed no signs of skin cancer. Knowledge about ERCC4-related neurodegeneration is limited and the disease is likely underdiagnosed. Nucleotide Excision Repair Disorder-related neurodegeneration should be considered as a differential diagnosis in patients with adult-onset neurodegenerative disorders, even if dermatologic complications are absent and the family history is negative. The preserved caudate volume in our ERCC4 patient could be a hint towards this rare condition. Treatment is symptomatic. Once the diagnosis is established, patients need to be advised to have regular medical consultations to prevent disease complications such as skin cancer."

    "abstract": "Expansions and contractions of tandem DNA repeats are a source of genetic variation in human populations and in human tissues: some expanded repeats cause inherited disorders, and some are also somatically unstable. We analyzed DNA sequence data, derived from the blood cells of >700,000 participants in UK Biobank and the <i>All of Us</i> Research Program, and developed new computational approaches to recognize, measure and learn from DNA-repeat instability at 15 highly polymorphic CAG-repeat loci. We found that expansion and contraction rates varied widely across these 15 loci, even for alleles of the same length; repeats at different loci also exhibited widely variable relative propensities to mutate in the germline versus the blood. The high somatic instability of <i>TCF4</i> repeats enabled a genome-wide association analysis that identified seven loci at which inherited variants modulate <i>TCF4</i> repeat instability in blood cells. Three of the implicated loci contained genes ( <i>MSH3</i> , <i>FAN1</i> , and <i>PMS2</i> ) that also modulate Huntington's disease age-at-onset as well as somatic instability of the <i>HTT</i> repeat in blood; however, the specific genetic variants and their effects (instability-increasing or-decreasing) appeared to be tissue-specific and repeat-specific, suggesting that somatic mutation in different tissues-or of different repeats in the same tissue-proceeds independently and under the control of substantially different genetic variation. Additional modifier loci included DNA damage response genes <i>ATAD5</i> and <i>GADD45A</i> . Analyzing DNA repeat expansions together with clinical data showed that inherited repeats in the 5' UTR of the glutaminase ( <i>GLS)</i> gene are associated with stage 5 chronic kidney disease (OR=14.0 [5.7-34.3]) and liver diseases (OR=3.0 [1.5-5.9]). These and other results point to the dynamics of DNA repeats in human populations and across the human lifespan."

    "abstract": "As life expectancy rises, so too does the prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases. Neurodegeneration causes progressive regional brain atrophy, typically initiating prior to symptom onset. Researchers measure the impact of potential treatments on atrophy in mouse models to assess their effectiveness. This is important because treatments designed to combat neuropathology are more likely to modify the disease, per contra to symptom management. Magnetic resonance imaging, while accurate in measurement of brain region structure volumes, is prohibitively expensive. Conversely, stereological volume assessment, the process of estimating the volume of individual 3D brain regions from imaged 2D brain sections, is more commonly used. This involves manually tracing brain region(s) of interest in regularly spaced imaged cross-sections to determine their 2D area, followed by application of the Cavalieri principle to estimate the volume. The pertinent caveats of this approach are the labor-intensive manual tracing process, and potential inaccuracies that arise due to human variation. To overcome these challenges, we have created a Neuropathology Assessment Tool (NAT) to automate regional brain tracing and identification using artificial intelligence (AI) and concepts from topological data analysis. The NAT was validated by comparing manual and NAT analysis of striatal volume in Huntington disease model mice. The NAT detected striatal atrophy with higher efficiency, 93.8% agreement with manual measurements, and lower inter-group variability. The NAT will increase efficiency of preclinical neuropathology assessment, allowing for a greater number of experimental therapies to be tested and facilitating drug discovery intractable neurodegenerative diseases."

Oculomotor impairments and gait variability have been independently considered as potential markers in HD. However, an integrated analysis of eye movement and gait is lacking. We performed multiple examinations of eye movement and gait variability in HTT mutation carriers, analyzed the consistency between these parameters and clinical severity, and then examined the associations between oculomotor impairments and gait deficits. We included 7 patients with pre-HD, 30 patients with HD and 30 age-matched controls. We collected demographic data and assessed the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) score. Examinations, including saccades, smooth pursuit tests, and optokinetic (OPK) tests, were performed to evaluate eye movement function. The parameters of gait include stride length, walking velocity, step deviation, step length, and gait phase. HD patients have significant impairments in the latency and velocity of saccades, the gain of smooth pursuit, and the gain and slow phase velocities of OPK tests. Only the speed of saccades significantly differed between pre-HD patients and controls. There are significant impairments in stride length, walking velocity, step length, and gait phase in HD patients. The parameters of eye movement and gait variability in HD patients were consistent with the UHDRS scores. There were significant correlations between eye movement and gait parameters. Our. show that eye movement and gait are impaired in HD patients and that the speed of saccades is impaired early in pre-HD. Eye movement and gait abnormalities in HD patients are significantly correlated with clinical disease severity."

    "title": "Burden of disease scenarios by state in the USA, 2022-50: a forecasting analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021.",
    "abstract": "The capacity to anticipate future health issues is important for both policy makers and practitioners in the USA, as such insights can facilitate effective planning, investment, and implementation strategies. Forecasting trends in disease and injury burden is not only crucial for policy makers but also garners substantial interest from the general populace and leads to a better-informed public. Through the integration of new data sources, the refinement of methodologies, and the inclusion of additional causes, we have improved our previous forecasting efforts within the scope of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) to produce forecasts at the state and national levels for the USA under various possible scenarios. We developed a comprehensive framework for forecasting life expectancy, healthy life expectancy (HALE), cause-specific mortality, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) due to 359 causes of disease and injury burden from 2022 to 2050 for the USA and all 50 states and Washington, DC. Using the GBD 2021 Future Health Scenarios modelling framework, we forecasted drivers of disease, demographic drivers, risk factors, temperature and particulate matter, mortality and years of life lost (YLL), population, and non-fatal burden. In addition to a reference scenario (representing the most probable future trajectory), we explored various future scenarios and their potential impacts over the next several decades on human health. These alternative scenarios comprised four risk elimination scenarios (including safer environment, improved behavioural and metabolic risks, improved childhood nutrition and vaccination, and a combined scenario) and three USA-specific scenarios based on risk exposure or attributable burden in the best-performing US states (improved high adult BMI and high fasting plasma glucose [FPG], improved smoking, and improved drug use [encompassing opioids, cocaine, amphetamine, and others]). Life expectancy in the USA is projected to increase from 78·3 years (95% uncertainty interval 78·1-78·5) in 2022 to 79·9 years (79·5-80·2) in 2035, and to 80·4 years (79·8-81·0) in 2050 for all sexes combined. This increase is forecasted to be modest compared with that in other countries around the world, resulting in the USA declining in global rank over the 2022-50 forecasted period among the 204 countries and territories in GBD, from 49th to 66th. There is projected to be a decline in female life expectancy in West Virginia between 1990 and 2050, and little change in Arkansas and Oklahoma. Additionally, after 2023, we projected almost no change in female life expectancy in many states, notably in Oklahoma, South Dakota, Utah, Iowa, Maine, and Wisconsin. Female HALE is projected to decline between 1990 and 2050 in 20 states and to remain unchanged in three others. Drug use disorders and low back pain are projected to be the leading Level 3 causes of age-standardised DALYs in 2050. The age-standardised DALY rate due to drug use disorders is projected to increase considerably between 2022 and 2050 (19·5% [6·9-34·1]). Our combined risk elimination scenario shows that the USA could gain 3·8 additional years (3·6-4·0) of life expectancy and 4·1 additional years (3·9-4·3) of HALE in 2050 versus the reference scenario. Using our USA-specific scenarios, we forecasted that the USA could gain 0·4 additional years (0·3-0·6) of life expectancy and 0·6 additional years (0·5-0·8) of HALE in 2050 under the improved drug use scenario relative to the reference scenario. Life expectancy and HALE are likewise projected to be 0·4-0·5 years higher in 2050 under the improved adult BMI and FPG and improved smoking scenarios compared with the reference scenario. However, the increases in these scenarios would not substantially improve the USA's global ranking in 2050 (from 66th of 204 in life expectancy in the reference scenario to 63rd-64th in each of the three USA-specific scenarios), indicating that the USA's best-performing states are still lagging behind other countries in their rank throughout the forecasted period. Regardless, an estimated 12·4 million (11·3-13·5) deaths could be averted between 2022 and 2050 if the USA were to follow the combined scenario trajectory rather than the reference scenario. There would also be 1·4 million (0·7-2·2) fewer deaths over the 28-year forecasted period with improved adult BMI and FPG, 2·1 million (1·3-2·9) fewer deaths with improved exposure to smoking, and 1·2 million (0·9-1·5) fewer deaths with lower rates of drug use deaths. Our findings highlight the alarming trajectory of health challenges in the USA, which, if left unaddressed, could lead to a reversal of the health progress made over the past three decades for some US states and a decline in global health standing for all states. The evidence from our alternative scenarios along with other published studies suggests that through collaborative, evidence-based strategies, there are opportunities to change the trajectory of health outcomes in the USA, such as by investing in scientific innovation, health-care access, preventive health care, risk exposure reduction, and education. Our forecasts clearly show that the time to act is now, as the future of the country's health and wellbeing-as well as its prosperity and leadership position in science and innovation-are at stake.

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative disorders are characterized by a progressive decline of specific neuronal populations in the brain and spinal cord, typically containing aggregates of one or more proteins. They can result in behavioral alterations, memory loss and a decline in cognitive and motor abilities. Various pathways and mechanisms have been outlined for the potential treatment of these diseases, where redox regulation is considered as one of the most common druggable targets. For example, in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) with superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1) pathology, there is a downregulation of the antioxidant response nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway. TDP-43 proteinopathy in ALS is associated with elevated levels of reactive oxygen species and mitochondrial dyshomeostasis. In ALS with mutant FUS, poly ADP ribose polymerase-dependent X ray repair cross complementing 1/DNA-ligase recruitment to the sites of oxidative DNA damage is affected, thereby causing defects in DNA damage repair. Oxidative stress in Huntington's disease (HD) with mutant huntingtin accumulation manifests as protein oxidation, metabolic energetics dysfunction, metal ion dyshomeostasis, DNA damage and mitochondrial dysfunction. The impact of oxidative stress in the progression of these diseases further warrants studies into the role of antioxidants in their treatment. While an antioxidant, edaravone, has been approved for therapeutics of ALS, numerous antioxidant molecules failed to pass the clinical trials despite promising initial studies. In this review, we summarize the oxidative stress pathways and redox modulators that are investigated in ALS and HD using various models."

    "abstract": "There is a growing consensus that brain development in Huntington's disease (HD) is abnormal, leading to the idea that HD is not only a neurodegenerative but also a neurodevelopmental disorder. Indeed, structural and functional abnormalities have been observed during brain development in both humans and animal models of HD. However, a concurrent study of cortical and striatal development in a genetic model of HD is still lacking. Here we report significant alterations of corticostriatal development in the R6/2 mouse model of juvenile HD. We examined wildtype (WT) and R6/2 mice at postnatal (P) days 7, 14, and 21. Morphological examination demonstrated early structural and cellular alterations reminiscent of malformations of cortical development, and ex vivo electrophysiological recordings of cortical pyramidal neurons (CPNs) demonstrated significant age- and genotype-dependent changes of intrinsic membrane and synaptic properties. In general, R6/2 CPNs had reduced cell membrane capacitance and increased input resistance (P7 and P14), along with reduced frequency of spontaneous excitatory and inhibitory synaptic events during early development (P7), suggesting delayed cortical maturation. This was confirmed by increased occurrence of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor-mediated giant depolarizing potentials at P7. At P14, the rheobase of CPNs was significantly reduced, along with increased excitability. Altered membrane and synaptic properties of R6/2 CPNs recovered progressively, and by P21 they were similar to WT CPNs. In striatal medium-sized spiny neurons (MSNs), a different picture emerged. Intrinsic membrane properties were relatively normal throughout development, except for a transient increase in membrane capacitance at P14. The first alterations in MSNs synaptic activity were observed at P14 and consisted of significant deficits in GABAergic inputs, however, these also were normalized by P21. In contrast, excitatory inputs began to decrease at this age. We conclude that the developing HD brain is capable of compensating for early developmental abnormalities and that cortical alterations precede and are a main contributor of striatal changes. Addressing cortical maldevelopment could help prevent or delay disease manifestations."

However, all reports of developmental delay in JOHD are exclusively based on retrospective review of medical charts. Comprehensive assessment of birth history metrics may provide better insight into the question of early life development in JOHD. To explore the prevalence of prematurity, birth complications, low birth weight and developmental delay in patients with JOHD in comparison to control participants. Parents of patients with JOHD and gene-non-expanded (GNE) control participants from Kids-HD (n = 104) and Kids-JOHD (n = 34, 24% with CAG > 80) studies completed a comprehensive birth history questionnaire. Answers focused on prematurity, birth complications, and birth weight, and along with reports of early developmental milestones, were compared between groups. There were no statistically significant differences in prematurity, birth weights, birth complications, or motor and verbal developmental milestones between JOHD patients and GNE controls (all P values > 0.1). Furthermore, stratifying JOHD patients by CAG expansion (low vs. high) also showed no significant differences (GNE vs. low or GNE vs. high). These findings support the notion that JOHD does not manifest as developmental delay before motor symptom onset and highlight a new framework to understand the course and nature of the disease."

The study included all middle-aged and older non-diabetic Japanese citizens who received health check-ups in Zentsuji, Kagawa, Japan (1998-2023). AST/ALT was classified into three categories: < 1.0 (reference), 1.0- < 1.5, and ≥ 1.5. CKD was defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate of < 60 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>. The Weibull accelerated failure time model was used to examine the association between AST/ALT categories and subsequent CKD onset because the proportional hazards assumption was violated. Of 6309 men and 9192 women, 2966 men and 4395 women remained in the final cohort. After a mean follow-up of 7.50 years for men and 8.34 years for women, 33.7% of men and 34.0% of women developed CKD. Women had higher AST/ALT than men. In women, a dose-response relationship was observed, with a 9% shorter survival time to CKD onset for AST/ALT ≥ 1.5 compared with AST/ALT < 1.0. In contrast, men had a shorter survival time to CKD onset by point estimates, but the 95% confidence intervals crossed 1 in all models. In this study comparing the risks of CKD development in non-diabetic men and women by AST/ALT levels, a dose-response relationship was only observed in women. Differences in the distribution of AST/ALT by sex may have affected the results. Therefore, in non-diabetic Japanese women, AST/ALT may be used as an indicator of future CKD development."

In this disease the neurological manifestations are associated with acanthocytosis of the red blood cells. The clinical features appear in the third to fourth decades of life. Generalized weakness, choreiform movement disorder, decline in cognition, and psychiatric symptoms are the characteristic features of the disease. The differential diagnosis between Huntington's disease and ChAc is difficult because both the diseases share similar neurological features. Herein, we recruited a large family with multiple individuals initially diagnosed as having Huntington's disease. Analysis of the DNA samples of affected individuals by exome sequencing detected a synonymous variant (NM_001018037.2; c.5040C > T) in the <i>VPS13A</i>. Multiple splice site detection tools were used to predict the potential pathogenicity of the novel synonymous variant. The variant, identified in this study, was predicted to be a cryptic splice donor site that may lead to aberrant pre-mRNA splicing. Reverse transcriptase PCR analyses of patient blood-derived RNA showed activation of a cryptic mid-exon splice donor, leading to frameshift. The variant was confirmed in all other affected and unaffected individuals using Sanger sequencing. This is the first report of synonymous variants of <i>VPS13A</i> as an underlying cause of ChAc. Our results provide the first direct evidence of the involvement of a synonymous variant of <i>VPS13A</i> in ChAc.

Baseline characteristics between surgical and injection groups were compared using Chi-squared and Kruskal-Wallis tests. Multivariable logistic regression with adjustment of confounders was implemented to identify which variables may influence whether patients received injection or surgical therapy. A total of 11,706 patients with PD were identified. The rate of new PD diagnosis per 100,000 patients increased by 0.37 every year, <i>P</i> < .05.

SCCT may have the potential to improve ADL and could complement multidisciplinary care strategy for HD patients."

    "title": "Role of Rho-associated kinases and their inhibitor fasudil in neurodegenerative diseases.",
    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) are prevalent in the elderly. The pathogenesis of NDDs is complex, and currently, there is no cure available. With the increase in aging population, over 20 million people are affected by common NDDs alone (Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease). Therefore, NDDs have profound negative impacts on patients, their families, and society, making them a major global health concern. Rho-associated kinases (ROCKs) belong to the serine/threonine protein kinases family, which modulate diverse cellular processes (e.g., apoptosis). ROCKs may elevate the risk of various NDDs (including Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease) by disrupting synaptic plasticity and promoting inflammatory responses. Therefore, ROCK inhibitors have been regarded as ideal therapies for NDDs in recent years. Fasudil, one of the classic ROCK inhibitor, is a potential drug for treating NDDs, as it repairs nerve damage and promotes axonal regeneration. Thus, the current review summarizes the relationship between ROCKs and NDDs and the mechanism by which fasudil inhibits ROCKs to provide new ideas for the treatment of NDDs."

    "abstract": "Extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) refers to a class of circular, non-chromosomal DNA that has recently gained widespread attention due to its potential role in aging and neurodegenerative diseases. The generation of ecDNA is closely associated with processes such as double-strand breaks, micronuclei formation, and the breakage-fusion-bridge (BFB) cycle, all of which are integral to regulation of gene expression, genetic stability, and clonal evolution. In neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease, the aberrant formation of ecDNA is closely linked to defects in DNA repair, alterations in synaptic plasticity, and neuronal dysfunction. The distinct distribution and functional roles of ecDNA in these conditions make it a potential diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target. This review provides an overview of the mechanisms underlying ecDNA formation and its functions in the nervous system. Additionally, it explores the clinical potential of ecDNA in disease diagnosis, targeted therapy, and personalized medicine, offering new insights for future research and treatment strategies."

    "title": "Single prolonged stress induces behavior and transcriptomic changes in the medial prefrontal cortex to increase susceptibility to anxiety-like behavior in rats.",
    "abstract": "Transcriptomic studies offer valuable insights into the pathophysiology of traumatic stress-induced neuropsychiatric disorders, including generalized anxiety disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) has been implicated in emotion, cognitive function, and psychiatric disorders. Alterations in the function of mPFC have been observed in PTSD patients. However, the specific transcriptomic mechanisms governed by genes within the mPFC under traumatic stress remain elusive. In this study, we conducted transcriptome-wide RNA-seq analysis in the prelimbic (PL) and infralimbic (IL) cortices. We employed the single prolonged stress (SPS) animal model to simulate anxiety-like behavior, which was assessed using the open field and elevated plus maze tests. We identified sixty-two differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (FDR adjusted <i>p</i> < 0.05) with significant expression changes in the PL and IL mPFC. In the PL cortex, DEGs in the susceptible group exhibited reduced enrichment for cellular, biological, and molecular functions such as postsynaptic density proteins, glutamatergic synapses, synapse formation, transmembrane transport proteins, and actin cytoskeleton reorganization. In contrast, the IL-susceptible group displayed diminished enrichment for synapse formation, neuronal activity, dendrite development, axon regeneration, learning processes, and glucocorticoid receptor binding compared to control and insusceptible groups. DEGs in the PL-susceptible group were enriched for Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways related to Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and neurodegeneration processes. In the IL cortex, the susceptible group demonstrated enrichment for KEGG pathways involved in regulating stress signaling pathways and addiction-like behaviors, compared to control and insusceptible groups. Our findings suggest that SPS activates distinct transcriptional and molecular pathways in PL and IL cortices of mPFC, enabling differential coping mechanisms in response to the effects of traumatic stress. The enhanced enrichment of identified KEGG pathways in the PL and IL mPFC may underlie the anxiety-like behavior observed in susceptible rats."

    "abstract": "The expansion of CAG/CTG repeats in functionally unrelated genes is a causative factor in many inherited neurodegenerative disorders, including Huntington's disease (HD), spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs), and myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1). Despite many years of research, the mechanism responsible for repeat instability is unknown, and recent findings indicate the key role of DNA repair in this process. The repair of DSBs induced by genome editing tools results in the shortening of long CAG/CTG repeats in yeast models. Understanding this mechanism is the first step in developing a therapeutic strategy based on the controlled shortening of repeats. The aim of this study was to characterize Cas9-induced DSB repair products at the endogenous HTT locus in human cells and to identify factors affecting the formation of specific types of sequences. The location of the cleavage site and the surrounding sequence influence the outcome of DNA repair. DSBs within CAG repeats result in shortening of the repeats in frame in ~ 90% of products. The mechanism of this contraction involves MRE11-CTIP and RAD51 activity and DNA end resection. We demonstrated that a DSB located upstream of CAG repeats induces polymerase theta-mediated end joining, resulting in deletion of the entire CAG tract. Furthermore, using proteomic analysis, we identified novel factors that may be involved in CAG sequence repair. Our study provides new insights into the complex mechanisms of CRISPR/Cas9-induced shortening of CAG repeats in human cells."

This study aims to explore associations between plasma PFASs, blood lipoprotein subspecies defined by apolipoproteins, and CHD risk. A case-control study of CHD was conducted in the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (HPFS) and Nurses' Health Study (NHS). Among participants initially free of cardiovascular disease at blood collection in 1994 (HPFS) or 1990 (NHS), 101 participants who developed non-fatal myocardial infarction or fatal CHD were identified and confirmed. A healthy control was matched to each case for age, smoking status, and date of blood draw. Plasma levels of perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), total perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), branched PFOS (brPFOS), linear PFOS (nPFOS), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), and perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA) were measured. Conditional logistic regression and cubic spline regression models were used to examine associations between baseline PFASs and CHD risk. Linear regression models were applied to study PFAS associations with lipids and their subfractions. After multivariate adjustments, total PFOS, brPFOS and nPFOS were significantly associated with increased risk of developing CHD, and HRs (95% CIs) per log(ng/mL) increment of PFASs were 3.66 (1.36-9.89), 3.68 (1.55-8.76), and 3.01 (1.16-7.86), respectively. Significant positive dose-response relationships were identified for these PFASs (P<sub>linearity</sub> = 0.01, 0.002, 0.02, respectively). Other PFASs were not associated with CHD risk. PFNA and PFDA were positively associated with total apoE levels among HDL particles with or without apoC-III. No associations were observed for other PFASs with blood lipid subspecies. Blood lipid subfractions did not explain the association between PFOS and CHD risk. Plasma PFOS and its isomers were positively associated with CHD risk. These findings suggest that PFOS exposure causes public health risks that are greater than hitherto believed."

However, the effect of lifelong cognitive engagement on the progression of motor and psychiatric domains in HD remains unknown, as is its neurobiological basis. Forty-five HD individuals completed the Cognitive Reserve Questionnaire (CRQ) and longitudinal clinical evaluation (maximum total of six visits, mean inter-assessment duration of 13.53 ± 4.1 months). Of these, thirty-three underwent longitudinal neuroimaging (18 ± 6 months follow-up). Generalized linear mixed-effects models were executed to predict the effect of individual differences in lifelong cognitive engagement on HD clinical progression and voxel-based morphometry to explore the impact of lifelong cognitive engagement on whole-brain gray matter volume atrophy. Controlling for age, disease stage, and sex, higher CRQ scores were associated with reduced overall severity and longitudinal progression across cognitive, motor, and psychiatric domains. Those with higher CRQ scores demonstrated reduced gray matter volume loss in the middle frontal gyrus, supplementary motor area, and middle cingulate. This putative impact on HD clinical progression may be conferred by preservation of brain volume in neural hubs that integrate executive function with action initiation and behavioral regulation, providing support for early cognitive engagement, even prior to diagnosis."

Nowata110 has demonstrated significant therapeutic efficacy in phase II clinical study against plantar warts. It has shown promising anti-cancer effects in both in vitro and in vivo studies using HPV-16 and HPV-18-induced cervical cancer models. This study evaluated the effectiveness of Nowarta110 in murine melanoma-implanted animals. Nowata110 is a novel compound composed of colloidal silver and fig extract. Male and female immunodeficient C(Cg)-Cd 79 atm 1 (cre) and immunocompetent BALB/c mice were used. Murine melanoma cancer cells (B16-F10) were implanted subcutaneously in experimental animals. Once the top cross-sectional area of tumors reached a minimum of 5 mm2 and approximately 4 mm depth, mice were anesthetized and treated with Nowarta110 intravenously or intratumorally. Control mice received no treatment. In non-treated immunodeficient mice, tumor growth progressed over five weeks, whereas Nowarta110-treated mice drastically reduced tumor volume until five weeks after treatment was initiated. Similarly, in untreated BALB/c mice, tumor growth persisted over five weeks. However, Nowarta110-treated mice exhibited a notable reduction in tumor size. Although intravenous administration of Nowarta110 did not result in complete tumor regression in immunodeficient mice, it did lead to reduced tumor growth. In BALB/c immunocompetent mice, intravenous treatment generally stalled tumor progression. Intratumoral and intravenous administration of Nowarta110 effectively treated murine melanoma in immunodeficient and immunocompetent mice. The Nowarta110 antitumoral efficacy was more pronounced in immunocompetent mice treated intravenously than immunodeficient mice. Clinical studies to examine the efficacy of Nowarta110 in human melanoma and skin cancers are warranted."

    "abstract": "While the symptoms of Huntington's disease (HD) typically first appear around the age of 40 years, 5%-10% of patients experience symptoms before the age of 21 years, in which case it is classified as juvenile Huntington's disease (JHD). JHD poses a unique clinical problem, as affected patients experience rapid deterioration in their quality of life as the motor manifestations of the disease become overwhelming. Medical treatment options for HD are sparse, and the only Food and Drug Administration-approved medication for the treatment of HD is the VMAT-2 inhibitor tetrabenazine. Unfortunately, treatments for JHD are even more limited, as investigational new drugs for HD oftentimes exclude patients with JHD from trials. Here, the authors present the case of a 15-year-old male with severe hypertonia and dystonic events secondary to JHD that was successfully treated with an intrathecal baclofen (ITB) pump. The patient experienced an improvement in hypertonia and a reduction in the frequency of dystonic events after ITB pump implantation, resulting in overall improved patient comfort. This case highlights the potential benefits of ITB therapy in managing debilitating hypertonia-type symptoms in patients with JHD. Given the limited treatment options for JHD, this intervention has the potential to profoundly enhance the quality of life for affected individuals. https://thejns.org/doi/10.3171/CASE24512."

To evaluate the impact of β-blockers on the timing of motor diagnosis onset and progression of HD symptoms. This observational, longitudinal multicenter study used the Enroll-HD platform database (initiated September 2011 to present), including propensity score-matched cohorts of patients with premanifest HD (preHD) and early motor-manifest HD (mmHD) who were either users or nonusers of β-blockers. Participants included patients with genetically confirmed preHD (n = 4683 eligible participants) or mmHD (n = 3024 eligible participants) who were taking a β-blocker and were matched to similar non-β-blocker users. Uninterrupted use of a β-blocker for more than 1 year. For PreHD: risk of receiving a motor diagnosis of HD over time. For mmHD: progression rate of total motor score, total functional capacity score, and the symbol digit modalities test. Post hoc analyses were performed to test additional clarifying hypotheses after the primary analyses were completed. This study included 174 preHD β-blocker users (59 males; 115 females) with a mean age of 46.4 (SD, 13.1) years and a mean cytosine-adenine guanine repeat length of 41.1 (SD, 2.4) who were well matched to 174 preHD non-β-blocker users. The preHD β-blocker users showed a statistically significant reduction in the annualized hazard of receiving a motor diagnosis compared with nonusers (n = 174) (hazard ratio, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.46-0.94; P = .02). There were 149 mmHD β-blocker users (86 males; 60 females) with a mean age of 58.9 (SD, 11.3) years and a mean cytosine-adenine guanine repeat length of 42.0 (SD, 2.3) matched to 149 mmHD non-β-blocker users. The β-blocker users had a slower mean annualized worsening in total motor score (mean difference [MD], -0.45; 95% CI, -0.85 to -0.06; q = 0.025), total functional capacity score (MD, 0.10; 95% CI, 0.02-0.18; q = 0.025), and symbol digit modalities test (MD, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.10-0.56; q = 0.017) compared with matched nonusers. In this study, β-blocker use was associated with delayed motor onset in preHD and reduced the rate of worsening of symptoms in mmHD. These findings demonstrated that β-blockers may have a therapeutic role in HD but further studies are required."

    "abstract": "Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by the expansion of a CAG trinucleotide repeat in the huntingtin (HTT) gene. When the CAG repeat exceeds 36, it results in the accumulation of the mutant HTT (mHTT) protein in neurons and glial cells. Key pathological mechanisms in HD include excitotoxicity, energy dysfunction, impaired mitochondrial function, increased oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation. The NLRP3 inflammasome is a multimeric protein complex element of NLRP3, ASC, and caspase-1, which regulates interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18 secretion. The NLRP3 inflammasome plays an important role in inflammatory reactions and is involved in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases. We have previously demonstrated high NLRP3 inflammasome expression levels in the striatum of R6/2 mice (a transgenic HD mouse model). Systematic administration of an NLRP3 inhibitor (MCC950) to R6/2 mice suppressed the NLRP3 inflammasome, decreased IL-1β and reactive oxygen species production, and reduced neuronal toxicity, suggesting protective effects against HD. Antrodia cinnamomea is an indigenous medicinal fungus in Taiwan, which shows diverse medicinal and pharmacological activities, but its effects in HD are not well understood. Herein, we report that systematic administration of Antcin-H isolated from A. cinnamomea to R6/2 mice suppressed the NLRP3 inflammasome, IL-1β production, and reduced neuronal toxicity. Most importantly, oral administration of Antcin-H reduced disease progression by increasing neuronal survival, reducing neuroinflammation during an extended lifespan, and improving motor dysfunction in R6/2 mice. Taken together, our data suggest that Antcin-H has therapeutic potential for treating HD."

Differential expression analysis using the limma package was conducted to identify genes that were differentially expressed between VTE and normal samples. Biological activities of these genes were then investigated through GO analysis utilizing the R language package. KEGG and GSEA were also performed to identify key signaling pathways. Furthermore, machine learning techniques were employed to determine hub gene signatures related to VTE, and ROC curves were used to validate the findings. To compare the immune infiltration of healthy and VTE samples, single sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) was applied. Lastly, the Spearman correlation coefficient was used to assess the relationship between the expression of hub genes and immune cell infiltration. <b>Results:</b> A total of 628 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were discovered between the VTE samples and normal samples. GO analysis identified protein polyubiquitination, lysosomal lumen acidification, organellar ribosome, mitochondrial ribosome, ammonium transmembrane transporter activity, and immunoglobulin binding as the processes with the highest abundance of DEGs. KEGG pathway analysis revealed that DEGs were enriched in ribosome, COVID-19, viral infection, oxidative phosphorylation, Parkinson's disease, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, apoptosis, and cancer. The most prominent KEGG pathways associated with VTE were ribosome, Parkinson's disease, oxidative phosphorylation, Alzheimer's disease, and Huntington's disease according to GSEA findings. DLST and LSP1 were identified as hub gene signatures in VTE by machine learning integrative analysis, and ROC curves confirmed their diagnostic value. Results from ssGSEA indicated a significant difference in the degree of immune cell infiltration between VTE and normal samples, with the expression of DLST and LSP1 positively correlated with the content of some immune cells. The R package, code, and analysis results used in this paper are available on https://github.com/doctorlaby/my-project. <b>Conclusion:</b> Our research is the first to utilize machine learning techniques in identifying DLST and LSP1 as significant biomarkers of VTE. With our findings, we have uncovered new insights into the underlying causes of VTE and potential treatments for affected patients."

Many of those at high risk of having a huntingtin (HTT) gene expansion remain untested with the exact number being unknown. The objective of this study was to estimate how many people in Northern Scotland are at 50% risk of having a HTT gene expansion to help with HD clinic service planning and to calculate how many people could access an effective treatment if available. Clinical and pedigree records from the North of Scotland Genetic Clinic were examined to estimate numbers of manifest HD patients, IPGEC, and individuals at 50% risk. The prevalence of those at 50% risk living in Northern Scotland was 45.2 per 100,000 people. Every manifest HD patient in Northern Scotland has 4.4 relatives at 50% risk and every patient with a HTT gene expansion has 2.9 relatives at 50% risk. There are up to 415 (46.2 per 100,000) adults who could access an effective treatment if available, but this number is likely to be an underestimate as not all manifesting individuals seek diagnosis. Despite high predictive testing rates, at least 2.2 adults are living with the HTT gene expansion for every one of the 14.5 per 100,000 manifest HD patients in Northern Scotland. Regional variation in rates and ascertainment need to be factored into future service planning, including genetic counselling and testing, management, and treatment delivery."

VAS pain, Musculoskeletal Tumor Society (MSTS) Upper Limb Function, and The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QoL Group Bone Metastases Module (QLQ-BM22) scores were all normalized to 100, and radiographs were obtained at baseline and at 14, 30, 90, 180, and 360 days postoperatively. The mean VAS pain score decreased significantly from 84 (SD 15) to 50 (SD 29), 38 (SD 30), 31 (SD 29), 31 (SD 29), and 21 (SD 23) between the baseline and follow-up times (p < 0.001).

The pain and functional subscales of the QLQ-BM22 also significantly improved at most times. A total of 12 devices broke, giving an unadjusted device fracture rate of 15%. Stabilization with the IS decreased pain and improved function with consistent results during the first postoperative year. IS is a new, minimally invasive type of internal fixation. The use of the IS alone may be better for impending rather than completed pathological fractures, and may be better in completed fractures if an added plate or more than the usual number of locking screws is required. Caution is warranted regarding its use alone in patients with a completed pathological fracture due to the rate of breakage of the device."

Consequently, understanding the structural intricacies of proteins within pathologically affected tissues often relies on mass spectrometry and proteomic analysis. Here, we utilized cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) and the Build and Retrieve (BaR) method to investigate protein complexes' structural characteristics such as post-translational modification, active site occupancy, and arrested conformational state in Alzheimer's disease (AD) using brain lysate from a rat model (TgF344-AD). Our findings reveal novel insights into the architecture of these complexes, corroborated through mass spectrometry analysis. Interestingly, it has been shown that the dysfunction of these protein complexes extends beyond AD, implicating them in cancer, as well as other neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and schizophrenia. By elucidating these structural details, our work not only enhances our understanding of disease pathology but also suggests new avenues for future approaches in therapeutic intervention."

    "abstract": "Understanding quality of life (QoL) is important in diseases for which there is no cure to date, such as Huntington's disease (HD). A deeper level of understanding is, however, compromised by the lack of studies examining QoL from the perspectives of HD gene expansion carriers (HDGECs). Only a few qualitative studies on QoL in HD have been performed, yet none investigated how QoL is defined by HDGECs themselves. This qualitative study explores how premanifest and manifest HDGECs define their QoL. Online semi-structured interviews were conducted with 6 premanifest and 6 manifest HDGECs in the Netherlands. Qualitative content analysis was used to explore participants' QoL definitions via inductive coding and the subsequent formulation of (sub)categories and (sub)themes. Premanifest and manifest HDGECs had a different focus when defining QoL. Two subthemes were identified for premanifest HDGECs: Thoughts about a meaningful life regardless of HD and Concerns about the future progression and impact of HD. For manifest HDGECs, two other subthemes were identified: Coming to terms with HD and Shifting perspectives due to the impact of HD. One overall theme was generated, reflecting the difference and adaptive shift in focus between premanifest and manifest HDGECs: Shifting focus from ideality to reality. In providing optimal care, HDGECs should be considered as part of a complex, continuously changing environment, thereby taking into account their individual QoL experiences and tailoring care accordingly. HDGECs might benefit from forming helpful beliefs about future adaptability and resilience and developing adaptive coping strategies."

In this study, we leveraged the reprogramming potential of cereblon (CRBN)-based ligands and conducted a CRBN-dependent proliferation screen to identify CRBN-based MGDs capable of inducing the degradation of proteins essential for cell viability. Through our screening and subsequent medicinal chemistry optimization, we identified dCK1α-1 as a potent and selective CK1α-targeting molecular glue degrader. Furthermore, we synthesized an orally active derivative, dCK1α-2, with enhanced pharmacokinetic properties, which exhibited pronounced degradation activity and demonstrated efficacy in mouse models following oral gavage. These findings indicate that phenotypic drug discovery campaigns, in combination with chemically distinct CRBN ligand libraries, can accelerate the development of therapeutically relevant MGDs. Furthermore, the development of dCK1α-1 and dCK1α-2 provides new therapeutic options for cancers with functional p53 signaling and offers valuable chemical tools for future investigations into the role of CK1α."

    "abstract": "Plethora of research has shed light on the critical role of synaptic dysfunction in various neurodegenerative disorders (NDDs), including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Huntington's disease (HD). Synapses, the fundamental units for neural communication in the brain, are highly vulnerable to pathological conditions and are central to the progression of neurological diseases. The presynaptic terminal, a key component of synapses responsible for neurotransmitter release and synaptic communication, undergoes structural and functional alterations in these disorders. Understanding synaptic transmission abnormalities is crucial for unravelling the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration. In the quest to probe synaptic transmission in NDDs, emerging biophysical techniques play a pivotal role. These advanced methods offer insights into the structural and functional changes occurring at nerve terminals in conditions like AD, PD, HD & ALS. By investigating synaptic plasticity and alterations in neurotransmitter release dynamics, researchers can uncover valuable information about disease progression and potential therapeutic targets. The review articles highlighted provide a comprehensive overview of how synaptic vulnerability and pathology are shared mechanisms across a spectrum of neurological disorders. In major neurodegenerative diseases, synaptic dysfunction is a common thread linking these conditions. The intricate molecular machinery involved in neurotransmitter release, synaptic vesicle dynamics, and presynaptic protein regulation are key areas of focus for understanding synaptic alterations in neurodegenerative diseases."

    "abstract": "Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative polyglutamine (polyQ) disease resulting from the expansion of CAG repeats located in the ORF of the huntingtin gene (HTT). The extent to which mutant mRNA-driven disruptions contribute to HD pathogenesis, particularly in comparison to the dominant mechanisms related to the gain-of-function effects of the mutant polyQ protein, is still debatable. To evaluate this contribution in vivo, we generated two mouse models through a knock-in strategy at the Rosa26 locus. These models expressed distinct variants of human mutant HTT cDNA fragment: a translated variant (HD/100Q model, serving as a reference) and a nontranslated variant (HD/100CAG model). The cohorts of animals were subjected to a broad spectrum of molecular, behavioral, and cognitive analysis for 21 months. Behavioral testing revealed alterations in both models, with the HD/100Q model exhibiting late disease phenotype. The rotarod, static rod, and open-field tests showed some motor deficits in HD/100CAG and HD/100Q model mice during the light phase, while ActiMot indicated hyperkinesis during the dark phase. Both models also exhibited certain gene deregulations in the striatum that are related to disrupted pathways and phenotype alterations observed in HD. In conclusion, we provide in vivo evidence for a minor contributory role of mutant RNA in HD pathogenesis. The separated effects resulting from the presence of mutant RNA in the HD/100CAG model led to less severe but, to some extent, similar types of impairments as in the HD/100Q model. Increased anxiety was one of the most substantial effects caused by mutant HTT RNA."

    "abstract": "Ion channels are integral membrane proteins embedded in biological membranes, and they comprise specific proteins that control the flow of ion transporters in and out of cells, playing crucial roles in the biological functions of different cells. They maintain the homeostasis of water and ion metabolism by facilitating ion transport and participate in the physiological processes of neurons and glial cells by regulating signaling pathways. Neurodegenerative diseases are a group of disorders characterized by the progressive loss of neurons in the central nervous system (CNS) or peripheral nervous system (PNS). Despite significant progress in understanding the pathophysiological processes of various neurological diseases in recent years, effective treatments for mitigating the damage caused by these diseases remain inadequate. Increasing evidence suggests that ion channels are closely associated with neuroinflammation; oxidative stress; and the characteristic proteins in neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and multiple sclerosis (MS). Therefore, studying the pathogenic mechanisms closely related to ion channels in neurodegenerative diseases can help identify more effective therapeutic targets for treating neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we discuss the progress of research on ion channels in different neurodegenerative diseases and emphasize the feasibility and potential of treating such diseases from the perspective of ion channels."

    "abstract": "Drug delivery, tissue engineering, and cell promotion in biomedical fields heavily rely on the use of nanomaterials (NMs). When they penetrate cells, NPs undergo degradation and initiate the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by causing changes in the structures of organelles linked to mitochondria. Inside the cell, the excess production of ROS can initiate a chain reaction, along with the autophagy process that helps maintain ROS balance by discarding unnecessary materials. At present, there is no effective treatment for Alzheimer's disease (AD), a progressive neurodegenerative disease. The use of NMs for siRNA delivery could become a promising treatment for AD and other CNS disorders. Recent research demonstrates that the use of combined NPs can induce autophagy in cells. This article emphasizes the importance of the shape of siRNA-encapsulated NMs in determining their efficiency in delivering and suppressing gene activity in the central nervous system. Because of its strict selectivity against foreign substances, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) significantly hinders the delivery of therapeutic agents to the brain. Conventional chemotherapeutic drugs are significantly less effective against brain cancers due to this limitation. As a result, NMs have become a promising approach for targeted drug delivery, as they can be modified to carry specific ligands that direct them to their intended targets. This review thoroughly examines the latest breakthroughs in using NMs to deliver bioactive compounds across the BBB, focusing on their use in cancer treatments. The review starts by examining the structure and functions of the BBB and BBTB, and then emphasizes the benefits that NMs offer."

    "abstract": "Pathological aggregation of a specific protein into insoluble aggregates is a common hallmark of various neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs). In the earlier literature, each NDD is characterized by the aggregation of one or two pathogenic proteins, which can serve as disease-specific biomarkers. The aggregation of these specific proteins is thought to be a major cause of or deleterious result in most NDDs. However, accumulating evidence shows that a pathogenic protein can interact and co-aggregate with other pathogenic proteins in different NDDs, thereby contributing to disease onset and progression synergistically. During the past years, more than one type of NDD has been found to co-exist in some individuals, which may increase the complexity and pathogenicity of these diseases. This article reviews and discusses the biochemical characteristics and molecular mechanisms underlying the co-aggregation and co-pathologies associated with TDP-43 pathology. The TDP-43 aggregates, as a hallmark of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), can often be detected in other NDDs, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD) and spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2). In many cases, TDP-43 is shown to interact and co-aggregate with multiple pathogenic proteins in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, the co-occurrence and co-aggregation of TDP-43 with other pathogenic proteins have important consequences that may aggravate the diseases. Thus, the current viewpoint that the co-aggregation of TDP-43 with other pathogenic proteins in NDDs and their relevance to disease progression may gain insights into the patho-mechanisms and therapeutic potential of various NDDs."

    "abstract": "Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease caused by a single mutation in the huntingtin gene (HTT). Normal HTT has a CAG trinucleotide repeat at its N-terminal within the range of 36. However, once the CAG repeats exceed 37, the mutant gene (mHTT) will encode mutant HTT protein (mHTT), which results in neurodegeneration in the brain, specifically in the striatum and other brain regions. Since the mutation was discovered, there have been many research efforts to understand the mechanism and develop therapeutic strategies to treat HD. HTT is a large protein with many post-translational modification sites (PTMs) and can be modified by phosphorylation, acetylation, methylation, sumoylation, etc. Some modifications reduced mHTT toxicity both in cell and animal models of HD. We aimed to find the known kinase inhibitors that can modulate the toxicity of mHTT. We performed an in vitro kinase assay using HTT peptides, which bear different PTM sites identified by us previously. A total of 368 kinases were screened. Among those kinases, cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) affected the serine phosphorylation on the peptides that contain S1181 and S1201 of HTT. We explored the effect of CDK1 and CDK5 on the phosphorylation of these PTMs of HTT and found that CDK5 modified these two serine sites, while CDK5 knockdown reduced the phosphorylation of S1181 and S1201. Modifying these two serine sites altered the neuronal toxicity induced by mHTT. Roscovitine, a CDK inhibitor, reduced the p-S1181 and p-S1201 and had a protective effect against mHTT toxicity. We further investigated the feasibility of the use of roscovitine in HD mice. We confirmed that roscovitine penetrated the mouse brain by IP injection and inhibited CDK5 activity in the brains of HD mice. It is promising to move this study to in vivo for pre-clinical HD treatment."

    "abstract": "Several neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs), such as Huntington's disease, six of the spinocerebellar ataxias, dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy, and spinobulbar muscular atrophy, are caused by abnormally long polyglutamine (polyQ) tracts. Natural compounds capable of alleviating polyQ-induced toxicity are currently of great interest. In this work, we investigated the modulatory effect against polyQ neurotoxic aggregates exerted by erucin (ERN), an isothiocyanate naturally present in its precursor glucoerucin in rocket salad leaves and in its oxidized form, sulforaphane (SFN), in broccoli. Using <i>C. elegans</i> models expressing polyQ in different tissues, we demonstrated that ERN protects against polyQ-induced toxicity and that its action depends on the catalytic subunit of AMP-activated protein kinase (<i>aak-2</i>/AMPKα2) and, downstream in this pathway, on the <i>daf-16</i>/FOXO transcription factor, since nematodes deficient in <i>aak-2</i>/AMPKα2 and <i>daf-16</i> did not respond to the treatment, respectively. Although triggered by a different source of neurotoxicity than polyQ diseases, i.e., by α-synuclein (α-syn) aggregates, Parkinson's disease (PD) was also considered in our study. Our results showed that ERN reduces α-syn aggregates and slightly improves the motility of worms. Therefore, further preclinical studies in mouse models of protein aggregation are justified and could provide insights into testing whether ERN could be a potential neuroprotective compound in humans."

Accurately characterizing pathophysiological features and identifying reliable biomarkers for early diagnosis and optimized treatment are critical. Hindered by the blood-brain barrier (BBB), obtaining sensitive monitoring indicators for disease progression and achieving efficient drug delivery remain significant challenges. Exosomes, endogenous nanoscale vesicles that carry key bioactive substances, reflect the intracellular environment and play an important role in cell signaling. They have shown promise in traversing the BBB, serving dual roles as potential biomarkers for NDs and vehicles for targeted drug delivery. However, the specific mechanisms by which exosome influence NDs are not fully understood, necessitating further investigation into their attributes and functionalities in the context of NDs. This review explores how exosomes mediate multifaceted interactions, particularly in exacerbating pathogenic processes such as oxidative stress, neuronal dysfunction, and apoptosis integral to NDs. It provides a comprehensive analysis of the profound impact of exosomes under stress and disease states, assessing their prospective utility as biomarkers and drug delivery vectors, offering new perspectives for tackling these challenging diseases."

    "abstract": "Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the HTT gene encoding a mutant huntingtin (mHtt) protein. mHtt aggregates within neurons causing degeneration primarily in the striatum. There is currently a need for disease-modifying treatments for HD. Many therapeutic studies have focused on lowering mHtt levels by reducing its production or enhancing its clearance. One way to clear mHtt aggregates is to promote autophagy, which is disrupted in HD. Our previous studies showed that the small molecule p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75<sup>NTR</sup>) ligand, LM11A-31, prevented HD-related neuropathologies and behavioral deficits in multiple HD mouse models. This study investigated whether modulating p75<sup>NTR</sup> with LM11A-31, would reduce mHtt aggregates via autophagic/lysosomal mechanisms in HD models. LM11A-31 decreased mHtt aggregates in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells expressing mHtt (exon 1 with 74 CAG repeats) and in the striatum of R6/2 and zQ175dn mouse models of HD. The LM11A-31 associated decrease in mHtt aggregates in vitro was accompanied by increased autophagic/lysosomal activity as indicated by altered levels of relevant markers including p62/SQSTM1 and the lysosomal protease, mature cathepsin D, and increased autophagy flux. In R6/2 and/or zQ175dn striatum, LM11A-31 increased AMPK activation, normalized p62/SQSTM1 and LC3II levels, and enhanced LAMP1 and decreased LC3B association with mHtt. Thus, LM11A-31 reduces mHtt aggregates and may do so via engaging autophagy/lysosomal systems. LM11A-31 has successfully completed a Phase 2a clinical trial for mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease and our results here strengthen its potential as a candidate for HD clinical testing."

    "abstract": "The exchange of information and materials between organelles plays a crucial role in regulating cellular physiological functions and metabolic levels. Mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum membranes serve as physical contact channels between the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and the mitochondrial outer membrane, formed by various proteins and protein complexes. This microstructural domain mediates several specialized functions, including calcium (Ca 2+ ) signaling, autophagy, mitochondrial morphology, oxidative stress response, and apoptosis. Notably, the dysregulation of Ca 2+ signaling mediated by mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum membranes is a critical factor in the pathogenesis of neurological diseases. Certain proteins or protein complexes within these membranes directly or indirectly regulate the distance between the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, as well as the transduction of Ca 2+ signaling. Conversely, Ca 2+ signaling mediated by mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum membranes influences other mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum membrane-associated functions. These functions can vary significantly across different neurological diseases-such as ischemic stroke, traumatic brain injury, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Huntington's disease-and their respective stages of progression. Targeted modulation of these disease-related pathways and functional proteins can enhance neurological function and promote the regeneration and repair of damaged neurons. Therefore, mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum membranes-mediated Ca 2+ signaling plays a pivotal role in the pathological progression of neurological diseases and represents a significant potential therapeutic target. This review focuses on the effects of protein complexes in mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum membranes and the distinct roles of mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum membranes-mediated Ca 2+ signaling in neurological diseases, specifically highlighting the early protective effects and neuronal damage that can result from prolonged mitochondrial Ca 2+ overload or deficiency.

    "title": "Copper homeostasis and neurodegenerative diseases.",
    "abstract": "Copper, one of the most prolific transition metals in the body, is required for normal brain physiological activity and allows various functions to work normally through its range of concentrations. Copper homeostasis is meticulously maintained through a complex network of copper-dependent proteins, including copper transporters (CTR1 and CTR2), the two copper ion transporters the Cu -transporting ATPase 1 (ATP7A) and Cu-transporting beta (ATP7B), and the three copper chaperones ATOX1, CCS, and COX17. Disruptions in copper homeostasis can lead to either the deficiency or accumulation of copper in brain tissue. Emerging evidence suggests that abnormal copper metabolism or copper binding to various proteins, including ceruloplasmin and metallothionein, is involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders. However, the exact mechanisms underlying these processes are not known. Copper is a potent oxidant that increases reactive oxygen species production and promotes oxidative stress. Elevated reactive oxygen species levels may further compromise mitochondrial integrity and cause mitochondrial dysfunction. Reactive oxygen species serve as key signaling molecules in copper-induced neuroinflammation, with elevated levels activating several critical inflammatory pathways. Additionally, copper can bind aberrantly to several neuronal proteins, including alpha-synuclein, tau, superoxide dismutase 1, and huntingtin, thereby inducing neurotoxicity and ultimately cell death. This study focuses on the latest literature evaluating the role of copper in neurodegenerative diseases, with a particular focus on copper-containing metalloenzymes and copper-binding proteins in the regulation of copper homeostasis and their involvement in neurodegenerative disease pathogenesis. By synthesizing the current findings on the functions of copper in oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and protein misfolding, we aim to elucidate the mechanisms by which copper contributes to a wide range of hereditary and neuronal disorders, such as Wilson's disease, Menkes' disease, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington's disease, and multiple sclerosis. Potential clinically significant therapeutic targets, including superoxide dismutase 1, D-penicillamine, and 5,7-dichloro-2-[(dimethylamino)methyl]-8-hydroxyquinoline, along with their associated therapeutic agents, are further discussed. Ultimately, we collate evidence that copper homeostasis may function in the underlying etiology of several neurodegenerative diseases and offer novel insights into the potential prevention and treatment of these diseases based on copper homeostasis."

TME exhibits a fluorescence turn-on effect upon selective conjugation with proteins with free cysteines in surface-exposed and flexible environments-a distinctive signature of protein disorder. Using an affinity-based proteomic approach, we identify both basal disordered proteins and those whose folding status changes under stress, with coverage to proteins even of low abundance. In lymphoblastoid cells from individuals with Parkinson's disease and healthy controls, our TME-based strategy distinguishes the two groups more effectively than lysate profiling methods. High-throughput TME fluorescence and proteomics further reveal a universal cellular quality-control mechanism in which cells adapt to proteostatic stress by adopting aggregation-prone distributions and sequestering disordered proteins, as illustrated in Huntington's disease cell models."

In humans, only four vtRNA including vtRNA 1-1, vtRNA 1-2, vtRNA 1-3, vtRNA 2-1) have been discovered. In nerve cells, vtRNA is involved in synapse formation through MAPK signaling. vtRNA travels to the distal area of neurites as a key unit in the vault complex. Moreover, tRNA is detached from the vault complex in the neurite via a mitotic kinase Aurora-A-reliant MVP phosphorylation. Several molecules contribute to the formation of vtRNAs. For instance, SRSF2 and NSUN2 and their attachment to vtRNA1-1 determines the production of small-vtRNAs. Through the same factors, vtRNAs could play a role in neurodevelopmental deficits. Addition the role of vtRNA expression and vault proteins has been recently studied in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple sclerosis (MS), Huntington's disease (HD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) as well as brain cancers. While the mechanisms of vtRNA involvement in neurological disorders is not well-demonstrated, we believe this could be related to the impact of vtRNA regulation in autophagy, immunoregulation, RNA stability, cellular stress, apoptosis, and regulation of other epigenetic pathways.

Although striatum is highly enriched with Arg2, precise localization and function of striatal Arg2 have never been studied. Here, we confirm that Arg2 is the only arginase isoenzyme in the striatum, and, using genetic model of total Arg2 loss, we show that Arg2 in this region is fully responsible for arginase catalytic activity, and its loss doesn't induce compensatory activation of Arg1. We exhibit that Arg2 is present in medium spiny neurons (MSNs), striatum-specific projecting neurons, where it localizes in soma and neuronal processes, and is absent in astrocytes or microglia. Finally, analysis of NMR spectroscopy-measured metabolic profiles of striata of Arg2-null mice enabled to recognize two metabolites (NADH and malonic acid) to be significantly altered compared to control animals. Multivariate comparison of the data using orthogonal projections to latent structures discriminant analysis, allowed for discrimination between control and Arg2-null mice and identified metabolites that contributed the most to this between-group dissimilarity. Our study reveals for the first time the localization of Arg2 in MSNs and demonstrates significant role of this enzyme in regulating striatal metabolism. These findings may be especially interesting in the context of Huntington's disease (HD), a disorder that specifically affects MSNs and in which, with the use of mouse models, the onset of pathological phenotypes was recently shown to be preceded by progressive impairment of striatal Arg2, a phenomenon of an unknown significance for disease pathogenesis."

In recent years, compelling evidence indicates that purinergic signaling plays a key role in neuro-immune cell functions. The extracellular release of adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP), and its breakdown products (ADP and adenosine) provide the versatile basis for complex purinergic signaling through the activation of several families of receptors. G-protein coupled adenosine A<sub>2A</sub> receptors, ionotropic P2X and G-protein coupled P2Y receptors for ATP and other nucleotides are abundant and widely distributed in neurons, microglia, and astrocytes of the central nervous system as well as in peripheral immune cells. These receptors are strongly linked to inflammation, with a functional interplay that may influence the intricate purinergic signaling involved in inflammatory responses. In the present review, we examine the roles of the purinergic receptors in neuro-immune cell functions with particular emphasis on A<sub>2A</sub>R, P2X4 and P2X7 and their possible relevance to specific neurodegenerative disorders.

We propose the generation of lineage-specific human lateral ganglionic eminence precursors (hiLGEP) using direct reprogramming technology provides a novel and clinically viable cell source for cell replacement therapy for HD. hiLGEPs were derived by direct reprogramming of adult human dermal fibroblasts (aHDFs) using chemically modified mRNA (cmRNA) and a defined reprogramming medium. hiLGEPs were differentiated in vitro using an optimised striatal differentiation medium. Acquisition of a striatal precursor and neural cell fate was assessed through gene expression and immunocytochemical analysis of key markers. hiLGEP-derived striatal neuron functionality in vitro was demonstrated by calcium imaging using Cal-520. To investigate the ability for hiLGEP to survive, differentiate and functionally integrate in vivo, we transplanted hiLGEPs into the striatum of quinolinic acid (QA)-lesioned rats and performed behavioural assessment using the cylinder test over the course of 14 weeks. Survival and differentiation of hiLGEPs was assessed at 8 and 14-weeks post-transplant by immunohistochemical analysis. We demonstrate the capability to generate hiLGEPs from aHDFs using cmRNA encoding the pro-neural genes SOX2 and PAX6, combined with a reprogramming medium containing Gö6983, Y-27,632, N-2 and Activin A. hiLGEPs generated functional DARPP32 + neurons following 14 days of culture in BrainPhys™ media supplemented with dorsomorphin and Activin A. We investigated the ability for hiLGEPs to survive transplantation, differentiate to medium spiny-like striatal neurons and improve motor function in the QA lesion rat model of HD. Fourteen weeks after transplantation, we observed STEM121 + neurons co-expressing MAP2, DARPP32, GAD<sub>65/67</sub>, or GABA. Rats transplanted with hiLGEPs also demonstrated reduction in motor function impairment as determined by spontaneous exploratory forelimb use when compared to saline transplanted animals. This study provides proof-of-concept and demonstrates for the first time that aHDFs can be directly reprogrammed to hiLGEPs which survive transplantation, undergo neuronal differentiation to generate medium spiny-like striatal neurons, and reduce functional impairment in the QA lesion rat model of HD."

    "title": "Sensitivity and specificity of a seed amplification assay for diagnosis of multiple system atrophy: a multicentre cohort study.",
    "abstract": "The pathological hallmarks of multiple system atrophy and Parkinson's disease are, respectively, misfolded-α-synuclein-laden glial cytoplasmic inclusions and Lewy bodies. CSF-soluble misfolded α-synuclein aggregates (seeds) are readily detected in people with Parkinson's disease by α-synuclein seed amplification assay (synSAA), but identification of seeds associated with multiple system atrophy for diagnostic purposes has proven elusive. We aimed to assess whether a novel synSAA could reliably distinguish seeds from Lewy bodies and glial cytoplasmic inclusions. In this multicentre cohort study, a novel synSAA that multiplies and detects seeds by fluorescence was used to analyse masked CSF and brain samples from participants with either clinically diagnosed or pathology-confirmed multiple system atrophy, Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, isolated rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder (IRBD), disorders that were not synucleinopathies, or healthy controls. Participants were from eight available cohorts from seven medical centres in four countries: New York Brain Bank, New York, USA (NYBB); University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA (UPENN); Paracelsus-Elena-Klinik, Kassel, Germany (DeNoPa and KAMSA); Hospital Clinic Barcelona, Spain (BARMSA); Universität Tübingen, Tübingen, Germany (EKUT); Göteborgs Universitet, Göteborgs, Sweden (UGOT); and Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden (KIMSA). Clinical cohorts were classified for expected diagnostic accuracy as either research (longitudinal follow-up visits) or real-life (single visit). Sensitivity and specificity were estimated according to pathological (gold standard) and clinical (reference standard) diagnoses. In 23 brain samples (from the NYBB cohort), those containing Lewy bodies were synSAA-positive and produced high fluorescence amplification patterns (defined as type 1); those containing glial cytoplasmic inclusions were synSAA-positive and produced intermediate fluorescence (defined as type 2); and those without α-synuclein pathology produced below-threshold fluorescence and were synSAA-negative. In 21 pathology-confirmed CSF samples (from the UPENN cohort), those with Lewy bodies were synSAA-positive type 1; those with glial cytoplasmic inclusions were synSAA-positive type 2; and those with four-repeat tauopathy were synSAA-negative. In the DeNoPa research cohort (which had no samples from people with multiple system atrophy), the novel synSAA had sensitivities of 95% (95% CI 88-99) for 80 participants with Parkinson's disease and 95% (76-100) for 21 participants with IRBD, and a specificity of 95% (86-99) for 60 healthy controls. Overall (combining BARMSA, EKUT, KAMSA, UGOT, and KIMSA cohorts that were enriched for cases of multiple system atrophy), the novel synSAA had 87% sensitivity for multiple system atrophy (95% CI 80-93) and specificity for type 2 seeds was 77% (67-85). For participants with multiple system atrophy just in research cohorts (BARMSA and EKUT), the novel synSAA had a sensitivity of 84% (95% CI 71-92) and a specificity for type 2 seeds of 87% (74-95), whereas cases from real-life cohorts (KAMSA, KIMSA, and UGOT) had a sensitivity of 91% (95% CI 80-97) but a decreased specificity for type 2 seeds of 68% (53-81). The novel synSAA produced amplification patterns that enabled the identification of underlying α-synuclein pathology, showing two levels of fluorescence that corresponded with different pathological hallmarks of synucleinopathy. The synSAA might be useful for early diagnosis of synucleinopathies in clinical trials, and potentially for clinical use, but additional formal validation work is needed.

    "title": "Unknown roles of tau pathology in neurological disorders. Challenges and new perspectives.",
    "abstract": "Aging presents progressive changes that increase the susceptibility of the central nervous system (CNS) to suffer neurological disorders (NDs). Several studies have reported that an aged brain suffering from NDs shows the presence of pathological forms of tau protein, a microtubule accessory protein (MAP) critical for neuronal function. In this context, accumulative evidence has shown a pivotal contribution of pathological forms of tau to Alzheimer's disease (AD) and tauopathies. However, current investigations have implicated tau toxicity in other NDs that affect the central nervous system (CNS), including Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), Traumatic brain injury (TBI), Multiple sclerosis (MS), and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). These diseases are long-term acquired, affecting essential functions such as motor movement, cognition, hearing, and vision. Previous evidence indicated that toxic forms of tau do not have a critical contribution to the genesis or progression of these diseases. However, recent studies have shown that these tau forms contribute to neuronal dysfunction, inflammation, oxidative damage, and mitochondrial impairment events that contribute to the pathogenesis of these NDs. Recent studies have suggested that these neuropathologies could be associated with a prion-like behavior of tau, which induces a pathological dissemination of these toxic protein forms to different brain areas. Moreover, it has been suggested that this toxic propagation of tau from neurons into neighboring cells impairs the function of glial cells, oligodendrocytes, and endothelial cells by affecting metabolic function and mitochondrial health and inducing oxidative damage by tau pathology. Therefore, in this review, we will discuss current evidence demonstrating the critical role of toxic tau forms on NDs not related to AD and how its propagation and induced-bioenergetics failure may contribute to the pathogenic mechanism present in these NDs."

    "abstract": "Hydrogen sulfide has been known to humans for about 300 years and the previous studies emphasize only on its toxic side effects. In the last two decennium, researchers have varied their perspectives and insights towards H<sub>2</sub>S biology based on experimental findings. It has been found that H<sub>2</sub>S is an endogenic gaseous signaling molecule in many organisms and plays a crucial role in many systems and diseases. Early reports suggest that H<sub>2</sub>S as a neuromodulator influences calcium levels within the brain cells which ultimately control memory, learning, and cognition. It has also been observed that some complications in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases are due to anomalies in the biosynthesis and metabolism of H<sub>2</sub>S. This review focuses on the role of H<sub>2</sub>S in the pathophysiology of major neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease and Vascular dementia. H<sub>2</sub>S was observed to have a protective role in the above-mentioned neurological conditions and the H<sub>2</sub>S donor therapy may help in disease management. The H<sub>2</sub>S gas displays a neuroprotective role and protects against cellular damage thereby declining the neurological conditions. Some studies have revealed that treatment with H<sub>2</sub>S donors has improved neuronal damage, restored memory and cognition in animal models. In this review, we have discussed the role of H<sub>2</sub>S donors as neuroprotective agents with examples of some of the natural and synthetic H<sub>2</sub>S donors, and also briefly enumerated the molecules used to detect H<sub>2</sub>S in neurodegenerative diseases."

    "abstract": "Neurodegeneration has been recognized as the main pathophysiological alteration in the majority of brain-related diseases. Despite contemporary attempts to provide acceptable medicinal therapies, the conclusion has not been much beneficial. Besides, the complex pathophysiological mechanisms behind neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) urge the needs for finding novel multi-target agents. Accordingly, saffron with major active constituents and as multi-targeting agents have shown beneficial effects in modulating NDDs with higher efficacy and lower side effects. The present study provides a systematic and comprehensive review of the existing in vitro, in vivo, and clinical data on the effectiveness, and signaling pathways of saffron and its key phytochemical components in the management of NDDs. The need to develop novel saffron delivery systems is also considered. Studies were identified through a systematic and comprehensive search in Science Direct, PubMed, and Scopus databases through April 30, 2024. The whole saffron major constituents (e.g., saffron, crocin, crocetin, picrocrocin, and safranal) and NDDs (e.g., neuro*, spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington*, Parkinson*, Alzheimer*, and brain) were selected as keywords to find related studies. In the systematic analysis, 64 articles were directly included in the current study. Additional reports were added within the comprehensive studies in the review. Saffron and its active metabolites crocin, crocetin, safranal, and picrocrocin have shown acceptable efficacy in managing NDDs like Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, depression, and other NDDs via modulating apoptotic (e.g., caspases, Bax/Bcl-2, cytochrome c, and death receptors), inflammatory (e.g., NF-κB, IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and COX-2), and oxidative strass (e.g., Nrf2, GSH, GPx, CAT, SOD, MDA, ROS, and nitrite) signaling pathways. The presented in vitro, in vivo, and clinical evidences showed us a better future of controlling NDDs with higher efficacy, while decreasing associated side effects with no significant toxicity. Additionally, employing novel delivery systems could increase the efficacy of saffron phytoconstituents to resolve the issues pharmacokinetic limitations. Saffron and its major constituents employ anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic and antioxidant mechanisms in modulating several dysregulated-signaling pathways in NDDs. However, further research is necessary to elucidate the precise underlying mechanisms in exploring the feasibility of using saffron active compounds against NDDs. More studies should focus on dose-response relationships, long-term effects, highlighting key mechanisms, and designing more well-controlled clinical trials. Additionally, developing stable and cost-benefit novel delivery systems in future works helps to remove the pharmacokinetic limitations of saffron major constituents."

    "abstract": "Amyloid β (Aβ) aggregates are implicated in the pathology of several neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, and Parkinson's disease, and damage to membranes is considered one of the pathology-related effects of Aβ. Experiments in vitro indicate that Aβ can damage these membranes; however, such experiments were performed at Aβ concentrations in the micromolar range, several orders above the physiologically relevant conditions. Our studies with Aβ42 in the low nanomolar concentrations did not reveal any damage to the supported lipid bilayer, questioning this membrane damage mechanism of Aβ. However, the phospholipid composition can be a factor contributing to the interaction of Aβ with the membrane. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the interaction of 50 nM Aβ42 with supported lipid bilayers composed of equimolar ratios of POPS and POPC at phospholipid concentrations of 0.1 and 0.25 mg/mL. Using atomic force microscopy (AFM), we observed that Aβ42 induced damage to bilayers at 0.1 mg/mL, characterized by forming defects that grew in size and number over time. The defects penetrate only the upper leaflet of the bilayer, but no such defects were observed at 0.25 mg/mL phospholipid concentrations. We additionally determined Young's modulus of these bilayers as a measure of stiffness, and these values were 6.9 ± 3.6 MPa and 16.6 ± 5.3 MPa for the 0.1 mg/mL and the 0.25 mg/mL bilayers, respectively. These findings suggest that Aβ42's ability to induce bilayer damage depends on membrane stiffness, with softer bilayers (0.1 mg/mL) being more susceptible to Aβ42-induced damage. The results are discussed and compared with models in which Aβ42 oligomers create localized membrane damage. The implication of the results to the mechanisms of the Aβ42 oligomer pathology is discussed."

    "abstract": "Huntington's disease (HD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused by a cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) repeat expansion in the hungtintin gene. The disease exhibits sex-related differences in symptomatology and disease progression, but the effect on brain structural biomarkers and the interaction between sex and disease burden remain underexplored. To investigate the interplay between sex and disease burden on clinical measures and neuroimaging biomarkers in HD. We retrospectively analyzed data from Enroll-HD, TRACK-HD/ON, PREDICT-HD, and IMAGE-HD studies, including a combined dataset of 19,738 participants with CAG>=40. Linear mixed models were employed to evaluate the influence of sex and the sex-disease burden interaction on clinical evaluations (Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale and Problem Behaviors Assessment) and neuroimaging biomarkers (striatal volumes and cortical thickness), with CAG-Age Product Score (CAPS) used as a proxy for disease burden, while controlling for covariates. Female participants exhibited less pronounced striatal atrophy and cortical thinning with increasing CAPS (caudate: <i>β <sub>male/female</sub></i> =-3.462/-2.935, p<0.05; putamen: <i>β <sub>male/female</sub></i> =-4.775/-3.908, p<0.01). Regarding clinical measures, females experience greater motor decline with increasing CAPS (Total Motor Score: <i>β <sub>male/female</sub></i> =3.024/3.244, p<0.0001), greater cognitive decline (Symbol Digit Modalities Test : <i>β <sub>male/female</sub></i> =-34.89/-38.91, p<0.0001), and greater functional decline (Total Functional Capacity: <i>β <sub>male/female</sub></i> =-6.449/-6.817, p<0.05; Independence Scale: <i>β <sub>male/female</sub></i> =-32.44/- 34.99, p<0.001).

    "abstract": "Several reports have indicated that impaired mitochondrial function contributes to the development and progression of Huntington's disease (HD). Mitochondrial genome damage, particularly DNA strand breaks (SBs), is a potential cause for its compromised functionality. We have recently demonstrated that the activity of polynucleotide kinase 3'-phosphatase (PNKP), a critical DNA end-processing enzyme, is significantly reduced in the nuclear extract of HD patients due to lower level of a metabolite fructose-2,6 bisphosphate (F2,6BP), a biosynthetic product of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase 3 (PFKFB3), leading to persistent DNA SBs with 3'-phosphate termini, refractory to subsequent steps for repair completion. PNKP also plays a pivotal role in maintaining mitochondrial genome integrity. In this report, we provide evidence that both PFKFB3 and F2,6BP, an allosteric modulator of glycolysis, are also present in the mitochondria. Notably, the level of F2,6BP, a cofactor of PNKP, is significantly decreased due to the degradation of PFKFB3 in the mitochondrial extract of HD patients' brain. PNKP activity is thus severely decreased in the mitochondrial extract; however, addition of F2,6BP restored PNKP activity. Moreover, supplementation of F2,6BP in HD mouse striatal neuronal cells restored mitochondrial genome integrity and partially restored mitochondrial membrane potential and prevented pathogenic aggregate formation. We observed similar restoration of mitochondrial genome integrity in HD drosophila supplemented with F2,6BP. Our findings, therefore, suggest that F2,6BP or its structural analog hold promise as a therapeutic for restoring both nuclear and mitochondrial genome integrity and thereby of organismal health."

    "abstract": "Huntington's disease (HD) arises from a CAG expansion in the <i>huntingtin</i> (<i>HTT</i>) gene beyond a critical threshold. A major thrust of current HD therapeutic development is lowering levels of mutant <i>HTT</i> mRNA (m<i>HTT</i>) and protein (mHTT) with the aim of reducing the toxicity of these product(s). Human genetic data also support a key role for somatic instability (SI) in <i>HTT</i>'s CAG repeat - whereby it lengthens with age in specific somatic cell types - as a key driver of age of motor dysfunction onset. Thus, an attractive HD therapy would address both mHTT toxicity and SI, but to date the relationship between SI and HTT lowering remains unexplored. Here, we investigated multiple therapeutically-relevant HTT-lowering modalities to establish the relationship between HTT lowering and SI in HD knock-in mice. We find that repressing transcription of mutant <i>Htt</i> (m<i>Htt</i>) provides robust protection from SI, using diverse genetic and pharmacological approaches (antisense oligonucleotides, CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing, the <i>Lac</i> repressor, and virally delivered zinc finger transcriptional repressor proteins, ZFPs). However, we find that small interfering RNA (siRNA), a potent HTT-lowering treatment, lowers HTT levels without influencing SI and that SI is also normal in mice lacking 50% of total HTT levels, suggesting HTT levels, <i>per se</i>, do not modulate SI in <i>trans</i>. Remarkably, modified ZFPs that bind the m<i>Htt</i> locus, but lack a repressive domain, robustly protect from SI, despite not reducing HTT mRNA or protein levels. These results have important therapeutic implications in HD, as they suggest that DNA-targeted HTT-lowering treatments may have significant advantages compared to other HTT-lowering approaches, and that interaction of a DNA-binding protein and <i>HTT'</i>s CAG repeats may provide protection from SI while sparing HTT expression."

Buprenorphine/Naloxone is a medication that has been shown to be highly effective for the treatment of OUD.

We conducted a qualitative study focusing on experienced prescribers of buprenorphine to learn about what they believe are key challenges in prescribing this medication to patients with OUD and related strategies for improving treatment outcomes. We conducted two rounds of interviews with 12 prescribers who were either trained as a primary care physician, nurse practitioner, or physician assistant. These prescribers were recruited from an academically-based treatment program, a community health center, and a commercial substance use disorder treatment facility. Interview data were coded and analyzed in accordance with a grounded theory approach. Key findings and related recommendations emerged for patient monitoring, integration of behavioral health with prescribing, patient volume requirements, and use of telehealth. The interviews generated a number of recommendations for improving patient outcomes from buprenorphine treatment. Some of these recommendations can be implemented quite readily whereas others entail more substantial resources and time commitments."

Ixodes scapularis is one of the most important tick-borne disease vectors and has spread throughout the northeastern USA over the past four decades, with established populations in all states of the region. To better understand the rapid expansion of I. scapularis and the pathogens they transmit, we aggregated and analyzed I. scapularis abundance and pathogen prevalence data from across the northeastern USA, including the states of Connecticut, Maine, New Hampshire, New York and Vermont, from 1989 to 2021. Maine was the only state to collect data during the entire time period, with the other states collecting data during a subset of this time period starting in 2008 or later. We harmonized I. scapularis abundance by county and tick season, where the nymph season is defined as May to September and the adult season is October to December, and calculated I. scapularis pathogen infection prevalence as the percentage of ticks that tested positive for Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Babesia microti, Borrelia burgdorferi, and Borrelia miyamotoi. We then explored temporal trends in I. scapularis abundance and pathogen prevalence data using linear models. The resulting dataset is one of the most spatially and temporally comprehensive records of tick abundance and pathogen prevalence in the USA. Using linear models, we found small or insignificant changes in the abundance of nymphs and adults over time; however, A. phagocytophilum, B. microti and B. burgdorferi prevalence in both nymphs and adults has increased over time. For the period 2017-2021, the statewide average prevalence of B. burgdorferi ranged from 19% to 25% in I. scapularis nymphs and from to 49% to 54% in I. scapularis adults. The statewide average prevalence of all other pathogens in I. scapularis for 2017-2021, including A. phagocytophilum (4-6% for nymphs, 4-9% for adults), B. microti (4-8% for nymphs, 2-13% for adults) and B. miyamotoi (1-2% for nymphs, 1-2% for adults), was considerably less. Our efforts revealed the complications of creating a comprehensive dataset of tick abundance and pathogen prevalence across time and space due to variations in tick collection and pathogen testing methods. Although tick abundance has not changed along the more southern latitudes in our study over this time period, and only gradually changed in the more northern latitudes of our study, human risk for exposure to tick-borne pathogens has increased due to increased pathogen prevalence in I. scapularis. This dataset can be used in future studies of I. scapularis and pathogen prevalence across the northeastern USA and to evaluate models of I. scapularis ecology and population dynamics."

This review also highlights promising and controversial findings about the potential impact of vitamins on this group of diseases. Several developed countries standardize daily dietary vitamin intake to meet nutrient requirements, improve health, and prevent chronic diseases like NDDs.

In this genetic case-control study we compared the distribution of HTT CAG repeat sizes in predefined ranges between patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) (n = 2136) and anxiety disorders (ANX) (n = 493), and healthy controls (CON) (n = 1566). We used regression models to study interactions between the alleles and associations with fine-granular clinical phenotypes and basal ganglia structure. HD mutations in the range of incomplete penetrance (36-39 repeats) were not overrepresented in patients. In participants older than 48 years, 13-20 repeats on both HTT alleles were associated with a reduced ANX risk whereas a 13-20 | 21-26 combination was associated with an increased ANX risk. Post-hoc analyses confirmed a turning point around 21 repeats and trends in the same direction were detected for MDD. The joint patient | CON analysis of the full spectrum of allele combinations confirmed interaction effects and age-dependent allele | risk profiles. A short-by-long interaction effect and an age-dependent negative correlation of the short allele on the nucleus accumbens volume was detected, independently of the diagnostic group. In conclusion, we revealed that HTT CAG repeat sizes of both alleles in the non-HD range are associated with a risk modulation for common psychiatric disorders as well as basal ganglia structure differences in an age-dependent way, possibly implying that normal variation of the functionally diverse wildtype huntingtin protein may impact brain function."

Data from the Enroll-HD observational study were used to fit a continuous-time hidden Markov disease progression model, which identified five distinct states. The number of disease states was determined using a cross-validated maximum likelihood approach. A novel data augmentation method was used to correct the biased life expectancy of the progression model. Multiple sources of cost data were then mapped to Enroll-HD variables using expert experience. A simulation of a synthetic patient population was used to show the feasibility of the approach in estimating population costs and the impact of hypothetical intervention scenarios. Our results confirm that early cognitive decline, which is not captured by the total functional capacity score currently used by clinicians but flagged up in HD integrated staging system, can be quantified from participants' visits. Finally, the results of the UK cost modelling show that indirect costs of HD such as state benefits and lost gross domestic product contribution could be the driving factors for the societal cost, over and above health and social care costs."

    "abstract": "Impaired mitochondrial function has been associated with the onset of neurodegenerative diseases. Specifically, certain mitochondrial toxins, such as 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NP), initiate cellular changes within the striatum that closely resemble the pathology observed in Huntington's disease (HD). Among the pivotal signaling molecules contributing to neurodegeneration, cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) stands out. In particular, Cdk5 has been implicated not only in cellular pathology but also in the modulation of synaptic plasticity. Given its widespread presence in the striatum, this study seeks to elucidate the potential role of Cdk5 in the induction of corticostriatal synaptic plasticity in murine striatal cells subjected to subchronic doses of 3-NP <i>in vivo</i>, aiming to mimic the early stages of HD. Immunostaining analyses revealed an increase in Cdk5 in tissues from animals treated with 3-NP, without a significant change in protein levels. Regarding striatal plasticity, long-term depression (LTD) was induced in both control and 3-NP cells when recorded in voltage clamp mode. The Cdk5 inhibitor roscovitine-reduced LTD in most cells. A minority subset of cells exhibited long-term potentiation (LTP) generation in the presence of roscovitine. The inhibitor of D1 receptors SCH23390 prevented LTP in three of nine cells, implying that MSN cells lacking D1/PKA activation were capable of LTP induction when Cdk5 was also blocked. Nevertheless, the co-administration of H89, a PKA inhibitor, along with roscovitine, prevented the generation of any type of plasticity in all recorded cells. These findings show the impact of 3-NP treatment on striatal plasticity and suggest that Cdk5 during early neurodegeneration may attenuate signaling pathways that lead neurons to increase their activity."

    "abstract": "Copper (Cu), an indispensable micronutrient for the sustenance of living organisms, contributes significantly to a vast array of fundamental metabolic processes. The human body maintains a relatively low concentration of copper, which is mostly found in the bones, liver, and brain. Despite its low concentration, Cu plays a crucial role as an indispensable element in the progression and pathogenesis of central nervous system (CNS) diseases. Extensive studies have been conducted in recent years on copper homeostasis and copper-induced cell death in CNS disorders, including glioma, Alzheimer's disease, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington's disease, and stroke. Cuproptosis, a novel copper-induced cell death pathway distinct from apoptosis, necrosis, pyroptosis, and ferroptosis, has been identified as potentially intricately linked to the pathogenic mechanisms underlying various CNS diseases. Therefore, a systematic review of copper homeostasis and cuproptosis and their relationship with CNS disorders could deepen our understanding of the pathogenesis of these diseases. In addition, it may provide new insights and strategies for the treatment of CNS disorders."

    "abstract": "Understanding the interrelationship between the gut microbiota and host physiology, although still in its relative infancy, has taken important steps forward over the past decade. In the context of brain disorders including those characterized by neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative changes there have been important advances. However, initially research involved correlational analyses, had limited translational scope, and lacked functional assessments. Thus, largescale longitudinal clinical investigations that assess causation and underlying mechanisms via in depth analysis methods are needed. In neurodegeneration research, strong causal evidence now links the gut microbiome to Alzheimer's (AD), and Parkinson's Disease (PD), as supported by human-to-animal transplantation studies. Longitudinal interventions are being conducted in AD, PD, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington's disease, and multiple sclerosis. Neurodevelopmental research has also seen a boon in microbiome-related clinical research including in autism, Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and schizophrenia, which is confirming prior animal model work regarding the key time-windows in the gut microbiome important for infant cognition. While recent research advances represent important progress, fundamental knowledge gaps and obstacles remain. Knowing how and why the gut microbiome changes at the extremes of life will develop our mechanistic understanding and help build the evidence base as we strive toward counteracting microbial missteps with precision therapeutic interventions."

    "abstract": "Cannabinoids exert their effects on body tissues via cannabinoid 1 (CB 1 ) and cannabinoid 2 (CB 2 ) receptors. Receptors are present in brain, myocardium, vascular endothelium, platelets, and adipose tissues. Under normal physiologic conditions, endocannabinoid effects are minimal. The use of exogenous cannabis leads to endothelial dysfunction and increases vascular thrombosis via CB 1 receptor stimulation. On the other hand, CB 2 receptors may have a beneficial anti-inflammatory response. We reviewed reports of the effects of cannabis on the cardiovascular system utilizing PUBMED from the last 20 years with emphasis on the most recent reports. Despite a plethora of reviews and some retrospective studies, there is a need for more definitive data regarding the effect of cannabis use on cardiovascular events (CVE). Marijuana does not appear to accelerate atherosclerosis. There is a suggestion that it may induce myocardial infarction in a small percentage of users, especially in male users, particularly during recent use. It has a possibility of increasing cerebrovascular events when combined with other risk factors such as tobacco use. There is an association between cannabis use and increased evidence of peripheral vascular disease. To have a definitive answer to the question of whether cannabis contributes to CVE, there is an urgent need for prospective controlled studies with patients presenting to academically oriented medical facilities with CVE following cannabis use for either medicinal or recreational use."

    "abstract": "Apathy is common in Huntington's disease (HD) and difficult to treat. Multiple recent calls have been made to increase understanding of apathy across the spectrum of HD severity. Functional status is an important outcome in HD trials; however, no consensus currently exists regarding the impact of apathy on functional status in HD. The authors aimed to identify correlates of apathy and effects on functional status in a primarily early-stage HD sample. This study included secondary analyses of data from a study of neuropsychiatric symptoms in a clinical HD sample. Spearman correlation analyses were used to assess the relationships between apathy (with the Frontal Systems Behavior Scale-Apathy [FrSBe-Apathy] subscore), clinical variables, and patient-reported outcomes. To assess the association of apathy with functional status, two multiple regression analyses were performed, with a different functional status measure (Adult Functional Adaptive Behavior [AFAB] scale or Total Functional Capacity [TFC] scale) as the dependent variable in each analysis. Statistically significant correlates of apathy included the Quality of Life in Neurological Disorders (Neuro-QoL) Satisfaction With Social Roles and Activities and Neuro-QoL Positive Affect and Well-Being scores (N=70 patients). Univariate correlation analyses also revealed statistically significant associations of FrSBe-Apathy scores with both functional status measures. In the multiple regression analyses, apathy significantly contributed to variability in functional status as measured by both the AFAB (N=49 patients) and TFC (N=56 patients) scales. These results underscore the need to address apathy as a target for improving functional status, social satisfaction, and well-being in HD, even for individuals with early-stage HD."

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are increasingly linked to mitochondrial dysfunction and neuroinflammation. Central to this link are mitochondrial damage-associated molecular patterns (mtDAMPs), including mitochondrial DNA, ATP, and reactive oxygen species, released during mitochondrial stress or damage. These mtDAMPs activate inflammatory pathways, such as the NLRP3 inflammasome and cGAS-STING, contributing to the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. This review delves into the mechanisms by which mtDAMPs drive neuroinflammation and discusses potential therapeutic strategies targeting these pathways to mitigate neurodegeneration. Additionally, it explores the cross-talk between mitochondria and the immune system, highlighting the complex interplay that exacerbates neuronal damage. Understanding the role of mtDAMPs could pave the way for novel treatments aimed at modulating neuroinflammation and slowing disease progression, ultimately improving patient outcome."

    "abstract": "Nanopore sensing is now reshaping analytical proteomics with its simplicity, convenience, and high sensitivity. Determining the length of polyglutamine (polyQ) is crucial for the rapid screening of Huntington's disease. In this computational study, we present a cross-nanoslit detection approach to determine the polyQ length, where the nanoslit is carved within a two-dimensional (2D) in-plane heterostructure of graphene (GRA) and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). We designed a heterostructure with an hBN strip embedded in the graphene sheet. With such a design, polyQ peptides can spontaneously and linearly stretch out on the hBN stripe. By tuning the strength of an external in-plane electric field, molecular transportation of polyQ peptides along the hBN stripe can be effectively regulated. Subsequent cross-nanoslit motion can be applied to record time-dependent electric signals. The signal features are then utilized to train the machine learning classification models. The machine-learning-assisted recognition enables accurate determination of the protein's length. This nanoslit-sensing method may offer theoretical guidance on 2D heterostructure design for the detection of polyQ peptide lengths and rapid screening of protein-related diseases."

Polyadenylation (PA) and alternative polyadenylation (APA) are the two main post-transcriptional events that regulate neuronal gene expression and protein production. This systematic review analyzed the available literature on the role of PA and APA in NDDs, with an emphasis on their contributions to disease development. A comprehensive literature search was performed using the PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane, Google Scholar, Embase, Web of Science, and ProQuest databases. The search strategy was developed based on the framework introduced by Arksey and O'Malley and supplemented by the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The study selection was performed by two independent reviewers. Extraction and data organization were performed in accordance with the predefined variables. Subsequently, quantitative and qualitative analyses were performed. Forty-seven studies were included, related to a variety of NDDs, namely Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Disease induction was performed using different models, including human tissues, animal models, and cultured cells. Most investigations were related to PA, although some were related to APA or both. Amyloid precursor protein (APP), Tau, SNCA, and STMN2 were the major genes identified; most of the altered PA patterns were related to mRNA stability and translation efficiency. This review particularly underscores the key roles of PA and APA in the pathogenesis of NDDs through their mechanisms that contribute to gene expression dysregulation, protein aggregation, and neuronal dysfunction. Insights into these mechanisms may lead to new therapeutic strategies focused on the modulation of PA and APA activities. Further research is required to investigate the translational potential of targeting these pathways for NDD treatment."

    "abstract": "The basal ganglia (BG) in the brain exhibit diverse functions for motor, cognition, and emotion. Such BG functions could be made via competitive harmony between the two competing pathways, direct pathway (DP) (facilitating movement) and indirect pathway (IP) (suppressing movement). As a result of break-up of harmony between DP and IP, there appear pathological states with disorder for movement, cognition, and psychiatry. In this paper, we are concerned about the Huntington's disease (HD), which is a genetic neurodegenerative disorder causing involuntary movement and severe cognitive and psychiatric symptoms. For the HD, the number of D2 SPNs ( <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><msub><mi>N</mi> <mrow><mi>D</mi> <mn>2</mn></mrow> </msub> </math> ) is decreased due to degenerative loss, and hence, by decreasing <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><msub><mi>x</mi> <mrow><mi>D</mi> <mn>2</mn></mrow> </msub> </math> (fraction of <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><msub><mi>N</mi> <mrow><mi>D</mi> <mn>2</mn></mrow> </msub> </math> ), we investigate break-up of harmony between DP and IP in terms of their competition degree <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><msub><mi>C</mi> <mi>d</mi></msub> </math> , given by the ratio of strength of DP ( <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><msub><mi>S</mi> <mrow><mi>DP</mi></mrow> </msub> </math> ) to strength of IP ( <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><msub><mi>S</mi> <mrow><mi>IP</mi></mrow> </msub> </math> ) (i.e., <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"> <mrow><msub><mi>C</mi> <mi>d</mi></msub> <mo>=</mo> <msub><mi>S</mi> <mrow><mi>DP</mi></mrow> </msub> <mo>/</mo> <msub><mi>S</mi> <mrow><mi>IP</mi></mrow> </msub> </mrow> </math> ). In the case of HD, the IP is under-active, in contrast to the case of Parkinson's disease with over-active IP, which results in increase in <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><msub><mi>C</mi> <mi>d</mi></msub> </math> (from the normal value). Thus, hyperkinetic dyskinesia such as chorea (involuntary jerky movement) occurs. We also investigate treatment of HD, based on optogenetics and GP ablation, by increasing strength of IP, resulting in recovery of harmony between DP and IP. Finally, we study effect of loss of healthy synapses of all the BG cells on HD. Due to loss of healthy synapses, disharmony between DP and IP increases, leading to worsen symptoms of the HD.

    "abstract": "Oligonucleotide therapeutics (ASOs and siRNAs) have been explored for modulation of gene expression in the central nervous system (CNS), with several drugs approved and many in clinical evaluation. Administration of highly concentrated oligonucleotides to the CNS can induce acute neurotoxicity. We demonstrate that delivery of concentrated oligonucleotides to the CSF in awake mice induces acute toxicity, observable within seconds of injection. Electroencephalography and electromyography in awake mice demonstrated seizures. Using ion chromatography, we show that siRNAs can tightly bind Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> up to molar equivalents of the phosphodiester/phosphorothioate bonds independently of the structure or phosphorothioate content. Optimization of the formulation by adding high concentrations (above biological levels) of divalent cations (Ca<sup>2+</sup> alone, Mg<sup>2+</sup> alone, or Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup>) prevents seizures with no impact on the distribution or efficacy of the oligonucleotide.

The present study aimed to evaluate the experimental effects of exposure to nicotine on the gene expression profiles of rat brain tissues with differentially expressed genes (DEGs). &lt;b&gt;Materials and Methods:&lt;/b&gt; The rat gene expression profiles of environmental exposure to nicotine were initially screened and retrieved from the microarray dataset GSE59895 in the GEO database. Next, it was analyzed with an integrated bioinformatics pipeline. The DEGs were analyzed in Limma and functional enrichment analyses of GO terms and KEGG pathways were performed with clusterProfiler. The STRING online tools and Cytoscape StringApp were subsequently employed to construct the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, whereas key modules and hub genes were finally explored and visualized. &lt;b&gt;Results:&lt;/b&gt; There was total of 382 shared DEGs between different case groups in the experiment, whereas 9 common shared DEGs were found among all three groups. The significant enrichments of 28 GO terms and 3 KEGG pathways were comprehensively analyzed with corresponding functionally enriched genes. Then, 3 key modules and 10 hub genes were further identified and explored in the resulted PPI network. In the disease-related signaling pathways, eleven potential neuropathic disease-related genes may complement the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. &lt;b&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/b&gt; The study found that chronic exposure to nicotine would result in the differential expression of the disease-related genes, whereas these DEGs might increase the environmental risks of Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease and other multiple neurodegenerative diseases."

    "abstract": "Microglia, the resident immune cells of the central nervous system, emerge in the brain during early embryonic development and persist throughout life. They play essential roles in brain homeostasis, and their dysfunction contributes to neuroinflammation and the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. Recent studies have uncovered an intricate relationship between microglia functions and metabolic processes, offering fresh perspectives on disease mechanisms and possible treatments. Despite these advancements, there are still significant gaps in our understanding of how metabolic dysregulation affects microglial phenotypes in these disorders. This review aims to address these gaps, laying the groundwork for future research on the topic. We specifically examine how metabolic shifts in microglia, such as the transition from oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial metabolism to heightened glycolysis during proinflammatory states, impact the disease progression in Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Huntington's disease. Additionally, we explore the role of iron, fatty and amino acid metabolism in microglial homeostasis and repair. Identifying both distinct and shared metabolic adaptations in microglia across neurodegenerative diseases could reveal common therapeutic targets and provide a deeper understanding of disease-specific mechanisms underlying multiple CNS disorders."

In this work, we designed novel MiniPromoters to target D1 and D2 type dopaminoceptive medium spiny neurons in the striatum by manually identifying candidate regulatory regions or employing the OnTarget webserver. We then empirically tested the designs in rAAV-PHP.B for specificity and robustness in three systems: intravenous injection in mice, intracerebroventricular injection in mice, and intracerebroventricular injection in non-human primates. Twelve MiniPromoters were designed from eight genes: seven manually and five using OnTarget. When delivered intravenously in mice, three MiniPromoters demonstrated highly selective expression in the striatum, with Ple389 (ADORA2A) showing high levels of dopamine D2-receptor cell co-localization. The same three MiniPromoters also displayed enriched expression in the striatum when delivered intracerebroventricularly in mice with high levels of DARPP32 co-localization. Finally, Ple389 (ADORA2A) was intracerebroventricularly injected in non-human primates and showed enriched expression in the striatum as in the mouse. Ple389 (ADORA2A) demonstrated expression in the medium spiny neurons in all three systems tested and exhibited the highest level of D2-MSNs and DARPP32 co-labeling in mice, demonstrating its potential as a tool for gene therapy approaches for Parkinson and Huntington disease treatment."

This study aimed at estimating the impact of these issues on the small ruminant production in Senegal in a holistic manner, using an approach developed by the Global Burden of Animal Diseases (GBADs) programme. The estimation focused on the mixed crop-livestock system, representing a large proportion (>60 %) of the small ruminant population in the country. It was based on existing data collected via a systematic literature review, acquisition of secondary datasets from local stakeholders, and expert elicitation. A dynamic population model was used to calculate the gross margin of the sector under both the current health constraints and an ideal health state, where animals are not exposed to causes of morbidity and mortality. The difference between the current and ideal health scenarios, termed the Animal Health Loss Envelope (AHLE), provides a quantitative measure of the farm-level cost of disease in the system. The all-cause AHLE was estimated at 292 billion FCFA (468 million USD, with 95 % prediction interval 216 - 366 billion FCFA) per year for 2022, for a population of 8.8 million animals. The contribution of Peste des Petits Ruminants (PPR) was modelled separately, as an example of attributing part of the AHLE to a specific disease cause. PPR was estimated to contribute 5 % of the total AHLE. The animal disease burden experienced by Senegalese livestock keepers was largely due to loss in animals and production, with relatively small amounts of animal health expenditure. Implementation of this study contributed to the further development of the GBADs approach. Such estimates can support decision making at all levels, from investment decisions at the international level to local disease awareness campaigns targeting livestock keepers."

Due to its diverse functions at various subcellular locations, HMGB1 has been identified as a crucial factor in several Central Nervous System (CNS) disorders, including Huntington's disease (HD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and Alzheimer's disease (AD). HMGB1 displays a wide array of roles in the extracellular environment as it interacts with several receptors, including CXCR4, TLR2, TLR4, TLR8, and RAGE, by engaging in these connections, HMGB1 can effectively regulate subsequent signaling pathways, hence exerting an impact on the progression of brain disorders through neuroinflammation. Therefore, focusing on treating neuroinflammation could offer a common therapeutic strategy for several disorders.

Most commonly, HD pathophysiology manifests in middle-aged adults with symptoms including progressive loss of motor control, cognitive decline, and psychiatric disturbances. Associated with the pathophysiology of HD is the formation of insoluble fragments of the huntingtin protein (htt) that tend to aggregate in the nucleus and cytoplasm of neurons. To track both the intracellular progression of the aggregation phenotype as well as the physiological deficits associated with mutant htt, two constructs of human HTT were expressed in the Drosophila melanogaster nervous system with varying polyQ lengths, non-pathogenic-htt (NP-htt) and pathogenic-htt (P-htt), with an N-terminal RFP tag for in vivo visualization. P-htt aggregates accumulate in the ventral nerve cord cell bodies as early as 24 h post hatching and significant aggregates form in the segmental nerve branches at 48 h post hatching. Organelle trafficking up- and downstream of aggregates formed in motor neurons showed severe deficits in trafficking dynamics. To explore putative downstream deficits of htt aggregation, ultrastructural changes of presynaptic motor neurons and muscles were assessed, but no significant effects were observed. However, the force and kinetics of muscle contractions were severely affected in P-htt animals, reminiscent of human chorea. Reduced muscle force production translated to altered locomotory behavior. A novel HD aggregation model was established to track htt aggregation throughout adulthood in the wing, showing similar aggregation patterns with larvae. Expressing P-htt in the adult nervous system resulted in significantly reduced lifespan, which could be partially rescued by feeding flies the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin. These findings advance our understanding of htt aggregate progression as well the downstream physiological impacts on the nervous system and peripheral tissues."

In addition to the typical manifestations, pain is a prevalent symptom associated with NDDs, seriously impacting the quality of life for patients. The pathogenesis of pain associated with NDDs is intricate and multifaceted. Currently, the clinical management of NDDs-related pain symptoms predominantly relies on conventional pharmacological agents or physical therapy. However, these approaches often fail to produce satisfactory outcomes. This article summarizes the underlying mechanisms of major NDDs-associated pain: Neuroinflammation, Brain and spinal cord dysfunctions, Mitochondrial dysfunction, Risk gene and pathological protein, as well as Receptor, channel, and neurotransmitter. While numerous studies have investigated the downstream pathological processes associated with these mechanisms, there remains a significant gap in identifying the key initiating factors. Specifically, there is insufficient evidence for the upstream elements that activate microglia and astrocytes in neuroinflammation leading to pain in NDDs. Likewise, there is an absence of upstream factors elucidating how dysfunctions in the brain and spinal cord, as well as mitochondrial impairments, contribute to the development of pain. Furthermore, the specific mechanisms through which hallmark pathological proteins related to NDDs contribute to these pathological processes remain inadequately understood. The objective of this article is to synthesize the existing mechanisms underlying pain associated with NDDs, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, Schizophrenia, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Multiple sclerosis, while also identifying gaps and deficiencies in these mechanisms. This paper offers insights for future research trajectories. Given the intricate pathogenesis of NDDs-related pain, it emphasizes that a promising short-term strategy is combination therapy-intervening concurrently in multiple pathological processes-akin to the cocktail approach utilized in treating acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). For long-term advancements, achieving breakthroughs in the treatment of the NDDs themselves will remain essential for alleviating accompanying pain symptoms."

Our analysis comprises 187 patients with notably higher-risk baseline features compared to those of the LOTIS-2 population, including a higher proportion of patients with bulky disease (17% vs. 0%), high-grade B-cell histology (22% vs. 8%), and increased number of prior lines of therapy (median 4 vs. 3). The complete response rate was 14% and overall response rate was 32%. The median event-free survival and overall survival were 2.1 and 4.6 months, respectively. Those with bulky disease and high-grade B-cell histology had significantly worse outcomes, and those with non-germinal center cell of origin and a complete response to the most recent line of therapy demonstrated superior outcomes. In summary, in this largest retrospective cohort study of Lonca in the real-world setting, the response rates, event-free survival and overall survival were lower than those reported in LOTIS-2, which is likely reflective of its use in higher risk and more heavily pre-treated patients in the real world compared to the patients enrolled on a clinical study."

Increased CVD/CMR contributed to the COVID-19 pandemic's unprecedented wave of disability and death, and the current state of cardiovascular health been equated to a \"Population Code Blue.\" There is an urgent and unmet need to reorient our priorities towards health promotion and disease prevention. This manuscript will review how nutrition and lifestyle affect outcomes in COVID-19 and how some interventions and healthy lifestyle choices can markedly reduce disease burden, morbidity, and mortality."

    "title": "Lymphatic vascular invasion: Diagnostic variability and overall survival impact on patients undergoing surgical resection.",
    "abstract": "The diagnostic criteria of lymphatic vascular invasion have not been standardized. Our investigation assesses the factors associated with lymphatic vascular invasion positive tumors and the impact of lymphatic vascular invasion on overall survival for patients with non-small cell lung cancer undergoing (bi)lobectomy with an adequate node dissection. The National Cancer Database was queried from the years 2010 to 2015 to find surgical patients who underwent lobectomy with at least 10 lymph nodes examined (adequate node dissection) and with known lymphatic vascular invasion status. Paired <i>t</i> tests were used to distinguish differences between the patients with and without lymphatic vascular invasion in their specimen. Multivariable analysis was used to determine factors associated with overall survival. Propensity score matching adjusting for overall survival factors was used to determine the lymphatic vascular invasion's overall survival impact by grade, histology, p-T/N/overall stage, and tumor size. Lymphatic vascular invasion status was reported in 91.6% and positive in 23.4% of 28,842 eligible patients. Academic medical centers, institutions with populations more than 1,000,000, and the mid-Atlantic region reported higher rates of lymphatic vascular invasion positive tumors as well as overall survival compared with other cancer centers. Lymphatic vascular invasion was independently associated with a significant decrement in overall survival as per multivariable analysis and propensity score matching. Propensity score matching demonstrated that lymphatic vascular invasion was associated with a significant decrement in overall survival for all histologies, tumor grades, tumor sizes, and stages, except for more advanced pathologic stages T3/III/N2 and larger tumors greater than 4 cm for which overall survival was trending worse with lymphatic vascular invasion positive. Lymphatic vascular invasion positive varies based on hospital location/type and population, but it was associated with a decrement in overall survival that was independent of pathologic T/N/overall stage, histology, and tumor grade. Lymphatic vascular invasion must be standardized and considered as a staging variable and should be considered as a sole determinant for prognosis, especially for those with earlier-stage and smaller tumors."

    "title": "Abnormal outer and inner retina in a mouse model of Huntington's disease with age.",
    "abstract": "Huntington's disease (HD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor dysfunction and cognitive decline. While retinal abnormalities have been documented in some HD patients and animal models, the nature of these abnormalities-specifically whether they originate in the inner or outer retina-remains unclear, particularly regarding their progression with age. This study investigates the retinal structure and function in HD transgenic mice (R6/1) compared to C57BL/6 J control mice at 2, 4, and 6 months of age, encompassing both pre-symptomatic and symptomatic stages of HD. Pathological assessments of the striatum and evaluations of motor function confirmed significant HD-related alterations in R6/1 mice at 6 months. Visual function was subsequently analyzed, accompanied by immunofluorescent staining of retinal and optic nerve tissues over time. Our findings revealed that R6/1 mice exhibited pronounced HD symptoms at 6 months, characterized by neuronal loss in the striatum and impaired locomotor abilities. Functionally, visual acuity declined at 6 months, while retinal light responses began to deteriorate by 4 months. Structurally, R6/1 mice demonstrated a global reduction in cone opsin expression as early as 2 months, with a decrease in rhodopsin levels at 4 months, alongside a thinner retinal structure compared to controls. Notably, rod bipolar cell populations were decreased at 6 months, exhibiting shorter dendritic branches and reduced synaptic connections with photoreceptors in the outer retina. Additionally, ganglion cell numbers in the inner retina decreased at 6 months, accompanied by aberrant neural fibers in the optic nerve. Microglial activation was evident at 4 months, while astrocytic activation was observed at 6 months. Aggregates of mutant huntingtin (mHTT) were first detected in the ganglion cell layer and optic nerve at 2 months, subsequently disseminating throughout all retinal layers with advancing age. These results indicate that retinal pathology in R6/1 mice manifests earlier in the outer retina than in the inner retina, which does not align with the progression of mHTT aggregation. Consequently, the R6/1 mouse retina may serve as a more effective model for elucidating the mechanisms underlying HD and evaluating potential therapeutic strategies, rather than functioning as an early diagnostic tool for the disease."

    "abstract": "The aggregation of α-synuclein in the nervous system leads to a class of neurodegenerative disorders termed α-synucleinopathies. A form of primary degenerative dementia called Lewy body dementia (LBD) often develops when these aggregations develop into intracellular inclusions called Lewy bodies (LB) and Lewy neurites (LN). Although high frequency of LBD are the leading cause of dementia after Alzheimer's disease (AD), limited information has been discovered about its pathological pathway or diagnostic criteria. In this report, we attempt to address such shortcomings via utilizing a proteomic approach to identify the proteome changes following intrastriatal injection of α-synuclein pre-formed fibril (α-syn PFF). Using mass spectrometry, we have identified a total of 179 proteins that were either up- or down-regulated at different time points, with the four proteins-TPP3, RAB10, CAMK2A, and DYNLL1, displaying the most significant changes throughout the timeframe. Through further examining the modulated proteins with network-based enrichment analyses, we have found that (1) the most significantly associated neurodegenerative pathways were Parkinson's (<i>p</i>V = 3.0e-16) and Huntington's (<i>p</i>V = 1.9e-15) disease, and (2) the majority of molecular functions specific to the pathology only appeared at later time points. While these results do not expose a conclusive biomarker for LBD, they suggest a framework that is potentially applicable to diagnose and differentiate LBD pathology from other forms of dementia by focusing on the cortical proteome changes which occur in a later time span."

    "abstract": "Infertility is a reproductive health problem that attracts worldwide attention. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a major cause of female infertility and patients with obesity and PCOS are particularly common in clinical practice. Long non-coding RNA (lncRNAs) are a functional core in cells that regulate gene expression, transcription, and chromatin modification processes, and participate in epigenetics, cell cycle, and cell differentiation. LncRNAs are assumed to play a role in the occurrence and development of PCOS; however, their specific mechanism of action remains to be elucidated. High-throughput sequencing technology has been used to sequence and analyze lncRNAs in exosomes from the follicular fluid of patients with obesity and PCOS and those who underwent assisted reproductive therapy owing to male factors. Specific expression profiles of patients with obesity and PCOS were obtained and functional information analysis combined with a literature review were performed to screen for differentially expressed lncRNAs, which were validated using real-time reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). High-throughput sequencing analysis revealed that compared to normal patients with male infertility, patients with obesity and PCOS had a total of 20 lncRNAs with significant expression differences in follicular fluid exosomes. Among them, 17 lncRNAs were upregulated and three were downregulated. Functional analysis showed that differentially expressed genes were mainly enriched in \"cell metabolism,\" \"cell adhesion,\" and other aspects: related gene pathways mainly involved Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, spliceosomes, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and ribosomes. Verification of differentially expressed lncRNAs revealed that the expression of lncRNAs TPT1-AS1, PTOV1-AS1, PTPRG-AS1, and SNHG14 in follicular fluid exosomes was consistent with the sequencing results. A preliminary differential expression profile of lncRNAs in exosomes of patients with obesity and PCOS was established by transcriptomic analysis of these individuals. Our bioinformatics analysis results may be applicable to further study of the impact mechanism involving obesity and PCOS. These differentially expressed lncRNAs maybe served as potential biomarkers for in-depth studies of the occurrence, development on Follicle quality and function for patients with PCOS in the future."

They are mainly characterized by progressive loss or dysfunction of neurons in the central or peripheral nervous system, and common diseases include Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease and so on. Mitochondria are important organelles for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production in the brain. In recent years, a large amount of evidence has shown that mitochondrial dysfunction plays a direct role in neurodegenerative diseases, which is expected to provide new ideas for the treatment of related diseases. This review will summarize the main mechanisms of mitochondrial dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases, as well as collating recent advances in the study of mitochondrial disorders and new therapies."

Common neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis have been widely studied. However, current therapeutics only reduce the symptoms and do not ameliorate the pathogenesis of these diseases. Recent studies suggested the roles of neuroinflammation, apoptosis, and oxidative stress in neurodegenerative diseases. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) exert anti-apoptotic, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidative effects. Therefore, investigating the effects of MSCs and their applications may lead to the discovery of more effective therapies for neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we review different approaches used to identify therapies for neurodegenerative diseases using MSCs."

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) are a diverse group of neurological disorders with progressive neuronal loss at specific brain regions, leading to impaired cognitive functioning, loss of neuroplasticity, severe neurological impairment, and dementia. The incidence of neurodegenerative diseases is increasing at an alarming rate with current treatments struggling to barely prolong the inevitable. The desperation to discover a therapeutic agent to treat neurodegenerative diseases and to aid in the process of healthy recovery has opened a gateway into natural pigments. The xanthophyll pigment lutein may bear the potential as a therapeutic agent against NDDs. Lutein plays an important role in brain development, cognitive functioning, and improving neuroplasticity. In vitro and in vivo studies revealed the neuroprotective properties of lutein against NDDs such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and cerebral ischemia. The neuroprotective effect of lutein is evidenced by the reduction of free radicals and the simultaneous strengthening of the endogenous antioxidant systems by activating the NRF-2/ERK/AKT pathway. Further, it effectively suppressed mitochondrial aberrations, excitotoxicity, overaccumulation of metals, and its resultant complications. The immunomodulatory activity of lutein prevents neuroinflammation by hindering NF-κB nuclear translocation, regulation of NIK/IKK, PI3K/AKT, MAPK/ERK, JNK pathways, and ICAM-1 downregulation. Lutein also rescued the dysregulated cholinergic system and resolved memory defects. Along with its neuroprotective properties, lutein also improved neuroplasticity by enabling neurogenesis through increased GAP-43, NCAM, and BDNF levels. Lutein exhibits strong neuroprotective activities against various NDDs. Though the investigations are in the exploratory phase, this review presents the consolidation of scattered evidence of the neuroprotective properties of lutein and urges its further exploration in clinical studies."

    "abstract": "Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are indispensable enzymes in all cells, ensuring the correct pairing of amino acids to their cognate tRNAs to maintain translation fidelity. Autosomal dominant mutations V133F and Y330C in histidyl-tRNA synthetase (HARS) cause the genetic disorder Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 2W (CMT2W). Treatments are currently restricted to symptom relief, with no therapeutic available that targets the cause of disease. We previously found that histidine supplementation alleviated phenotypic defects in a humanized yeast model of CMT2W caused by HARS V155G and S356N that also unexpectedly exacerbated the phenotype of the two HARS mutants V133F and Y330C. Here, we show that V133F destabilizes recombinant HARS protein, which is rescued in the presence of tRNAHis. HARS V133F and Y330C cause mistranslation and cause changes to the proteome without activating the integrated stress response as validated by mass spectrometry and growth defects that persist with histidine supplementation. The growth defects and reduced translation fidelity caused by V133F and Y330C mutants were rescued by supplementation with human tRNAHis in a humanized yeast model. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of cognate tRNA as a therapeutic that rescues HARS deficiency and ameliorates toxic mistranslation generated by causative alleles for CMT."

    "abstract": "Diet-related chronic diseases account for seven out of the ten leading causes of death in the USA. Food is Medicine (FIM) interventions can be effective adjuncts to standard medical care to address this cost burden. While the Food is Medicine Pyramid recommends some culinary skill development when integrating FIM into healthcare, the emphasis is on medically tailored meals and food provision. Hence, there is a practice gap to ensure patients develop the necessary skills to apply nutrition recommendations into improved food behaviors to achieve positive long-term health outcomes. This paper presents a theoretical framework for optimizing existing clinical services to provide FIM interventions, tracking associated improvements in patient outcomes, and identifying healthcare cost saving/revenue generation that can lead to a net value on investment. It describes how these interventions can and have been used in a clinical setting as adjuncts to clinical care. While there is published evidence for each modality individually, the literature lacks evidence of the value of an integrated approach. The framework therefore provides a roadmap to both identify best practices and evaluate outcomes that will inform viable financial models."

Prior studies revealed an increase in extracellular glutamate levels after evoking astrocytic SNARE-dependent exocytosis from cultured primary astrocytes from mutant huntingtin (mHTT)-expressing BACHD mice compared to control astrocytes, suggesting alterations in astrocytic SNARE-dependent exocytosis in HD. We used BACHD and dominant-negative (dn)SNARE mice to decrease SNARE-dependent exocytosis from astrocytes to determine whether reducing SNARE-dependent exocytosis from astrocytes could rescue neuropathological changes in vivo. We observed significant protection against striatal atrophy and no significant rescue of cortical atrophy in BACHD/dnSNARE mice compared to BACHD mice. Amino acid transporters are important for modulating the levels of extracellular neurotransmitters. BACHD mice had no change in GLT1 expression, decreased striatal GAT1 expression and increased levels of GAT3. There was no change in GAT1 after reducing astrocytic SNARE-dependent exocytosis, and increased GAT3 expression in BACHD mice was normalized in BACHD/dnSNARE mice. Thus, modulation of astrocytic SNARE-dependent exocytosis in BACHD mice is protective against striatal atrophy and modulates GABA transporter expression."

    "abstract": "<i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> usage has provided substantial insights into the pathogenesis of several nucleotide repeat expansion diseases (NREDs), a group of genetic diseases characterized by the abnormal expansion of DNA repeats. Leveraging the genetic simplicity and manipulability of Drosophila, researchers have successfully modeled close to 15 NREDs such as Huntington's disease (HD), several spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA), and myotonic dystrophies type 1 and 2 (DM1/DM2). These models have been instrumental in characterizing the principal associated molecular mechanisms: protein aggregation, RNA toxicity, and protein function loss, thus recapitulating key features of human disease. Used in chemical and genetic screenings, they also enable us to identify promising small molecules and genetic modifiers that mitigate the toxic effects of expanded repeats. This review summarizes the close to 150 studies performed in this area during the last seven years. The relevant highlights are the achievement of the first fly-based models for some NREDs, the incorporation of new technologies such as CRISPR for developing or evaluating transgenic flies containing repeat expanded motifs, and the evaluation of less understood toxic mechanisms in NREDs such as RAN translation. Overall, <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> remains a powerful platform for research in NREDs."

    "abstract": "Huntington's disease (HD) is a hereditary neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG tract expansion in the huntingtin gene (<i>HTT</i>). HD is characterized by involuntary movements, cognitive decline, and behavioral changes. Pathologically, patients with HD show selective striatal neuronal vulnerability at the early disease stage, although the mutant protein is ubiquitously expressed. Activation of the immune system and glial cell-mediated neuroinflammatory responses are early pathological features and have been found in all neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs), including HD. However, the role of inflammation in HD, as well as its therapeutic significance, has been less extensively studied compared to other NDDs. This review highlights the significantly elevated levels of inflammatory proteins and cellular markers observed in various HD animal models and HD patient tissues, emphasizing the critical roles of microglia, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes in mediating neuroinflammation in HD. Moreover, it expands on recent discoveries related to the peripheral immune system's involvement in HD. Although current immunomodulatory treatments and inflammatory biomarkers for adjunctive diagnosis in HD are limited, targeting inflammation in combination with other therapies, along with comprehensive personalized treatment approaches, shows promising therapeutic potential."

Among these, the most widespread are Alzheimer's disease (AD), dementia, Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Huntington's disease (HD)-all characterized by a progressive loss of neurons in specific regions of the brain leading to varied clinical symptoms. At the basis of neurodegenerative diseases, an emerging role is played by genetic mutations in the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene that cause increased LRRK2 activity with consequent alteration of neuronal autophagy pathways. LRRK2 kinase activity requires GTPase activity which functions independently of kinase activity and is required for neurotoxicity and to potentiate neuronal death. Important in the neurodegeneration process is the upregulation of casein kinase (CK), which causes the alteration of the AMPK pathway by enhancing the phosphorylation of α-synuclein and huntingtin proteins, known to be involved in PD and HD, and increasing the accumulation of the amyloid-β protein (Aβ) for AD. Recent research has identified CK of the kinases upstream of LRRK2 as a regulator of the stability of the LRRK2 protein. Based on this evidence, this review aims to understand the direct involvement of individual kinases in NDDs and how their crosstalk may impact the pathogenesis and early onset of neurodegenerative diseases."

Mechanisms contributing to ageing have been summarized as the hallmarks of ageing, with iron imbalance being one of the major factors. Ferroptosis, an iron-mediated lipid peroxidation-induced programmed cell death, has recently been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD) and Huntington's disease (HD). Addressing ferroptosis offers both opportunities and challenges for treating neurodegenerative diseases, though the specific mechanisms remain unclear. This research explores the key processes behind how ferroptosis contributes to brain ageing, with a focus on the complex signaling networks that are involved. The current article aims to uncover that how ferroptosis, a specific type of cell death, may drive age-related changes in the brain. Additionally, the article also unveils its role in neurodegenerative diseases, discussing how understanding these mechanisms could open up new therapeutic avenues."

    "abstract": "Ferroptosis is a type of programmed cell death owed to an intracellular accumulation of iron resulting in the generation reactive oxygen species, which in turn can cause peroxidation of plasma membrane lipids and ultimately result in cell death. We investigated the potential involvement of VPS13A deficiency in ferroptosis. The VPS13A gene encodes for chorein, and its deficiency is a molecular cause of chorea-acanthocytosis (ChAc), a Huntington-like disease with neurodegeneration in the striatum. In our previous study, we found male infertility characterized by increased malondialdehyde staining of the spermatozoa in the testes of the ChAc model mice. Thus, in this study we performed metabolome analysis of sperm extracted from the epididymis of the ChAc model mice, which revealed decreased cystine levels, suggesting an association between chorein deficiency and ferroptosis. We then investigated the role of chorein in ferroptosis using VPS13A knockdown (VPS13A-KD) HEK293 cells. We found that VPS13A-KD cells displayed a significantly diminished resistance to tert-Butyl hydroperoxide (tBHP)-induced lipid peroxidation and cell death compared to control cells, which could be rescued by treatment with ferrostatin-1. Moreover, VPS13A-KD cells showed Fe(II) accumulation, suggesting an impaired capacity for divalent iron removal. In the cytosolic fraction of VPS13A-KD cells, the protein level of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) was significantly reduced, suggesting that dysfunction of chorein impairs GPX4 transport, thereby facilitating ferroptosis. These results suggest that ferroptosis may contribute to neurodegeneration in ChAc caused by loss of chorein function."

Treating symptomatic patients with OSA syndrome to enhance quality of life remains a cornerstone approach. However, there is a lack of consensus regarding treatment to improve cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes, particularly in light of overall negative results from several randomized controlled trials (RCT) indicating no benefit of positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy on primary and secondary CVD events. These RCTs were limited by suboptimal PAP adherence, use of composite CVD outcomes, and limited diversity and generalizability to Sleep Clinic patients. As such, this workshop assembled clinical experts, as well as researchers in basic and translational science, epidemiology, clinical trials, and population health to discuss the current state, and future research directions to guide personalized therapeutic strategies and future research directions in OSA. There was overall consensus among workshop participants that OSA represents a heterogeneous disease with variable endotypes and phenotypes, and heterogeneous responses to treatment. Future research should prioritize employing multi-modal therapeutic approaches within innovative and adaptive trial designs, focusing on specific subgroups of OSA patients hypothesized to benefit from a CVD perspective. Future work should also be inclusive of diverse populations and consider the life-course of OSA to better comprehend treatment strategies that can address the disproportionate impact of OSA on racially minoritized groups. Further, a more holistic approach to sleep must be adopted to include broader assessments of symptoms, sleep duration, and comorbid sleep and circadian disorders. Finally, it is imperative to establish a sleep research consortium dedicated to collecting raw data and biospecimens categorized by OSA subtypes. This will facilitate mechanistic determinations, foster collaborative research, and help bolster the pipeline of early-career researchers."

This pilot study evaluates the feasibility and preliminary effects of the PiB-HD program. The study employed a pre-post design. Perceived feasibility by HD caregivers was evaluated using both quantitative and qualitative measures. Preliminary effects were based on self-report measures of self-efficacy, mastery, mood, quality of life, and capability to function. Coaches' evaluations were conducted using a questionnaire. In total, 18 caregivers completed the intervention. Findings demonstrate positive responses regarding the program's usability, relevance, and acceptability. Participants found the program helpful in addressing challenges, gaining insight into their actions, and feeling better equipped with skills to face future challenges. Descriptive statistics suggest that the PiB-HD program shows potential for reducing stress and anxiety. Additionally, coaches (<i>n</i> = 9) viewed the program positively for its usability, integration potential into their work, flexibility, and time efficiency. The PiB-HD program proved to be feasible, usable and acceptable for caregivers of people with HD.

In the past two decades, increasing studies have indicated that glycyrrhizic acid (GL), the main active ingredient from traditional Chinese medicine licorice (widely used in the food industry) and a triterpenoid saponin with multiple pharmacological effects (such as anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immune regulation), and its metabolites (glycyrrhetinic acid and carbenoxolone) play a neuroprotective role in a range of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease and epilepsy. This review will elaborate on the multiple neuroprotective mechanisms of GL and its metabolites in this series of diseases, aiming to provide a basis for further research on these protective drugs for neurodegenerative diseases and their clinical application. In summary, GL may be a promising candidate drug for the therapy of neurodegenerative diseases."

    "title": "Performance Comparison between Deep Neural Network and Machine Learning based Classifiers for Huntington Disease Prediction from Human DNA Sequence.",
    "abstract": "Huntington Disease (HD) is a type of neurodegenerative disorder which causes problems like psychiatric disturbances, movement problem, weight loss and problem in sleep. It needs to be addressed in earlier stage of human life. Nowadays Deep Learning (DL) based system could help physicians provide second opinion in treating patient's disease. In this work, human Deoxyribo Nucleic Acid (DNA) sequence is analyzed using Deep Neural Network (DNN) algorithm to predict the HD disease. The main objective of this work is to identify whether the human DNA is affected by HD or not. Human DNA sequences are collected from National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and synthetic human DNA data are also constructed for process. Then numerical conversion of human DNA sequence data is done by Chaos Game Representation (CGR) method. After that, numerical values of DNA data are used for feature extraction. Mean, median, standard deviation, entropy, contrast, correlation, energy and homogeneity are extracted. Additionally, the following features such as counts of adenine, thymine, guanine and cytosine are extracted from the DNA sequence data itself. The extracted features are used as input to the DNN classifier and other machine learning based classifiers such as NN (Neural Network), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF) and Classification Tree with Forward Pruning (CTWFP). Six performance measures are used such as Accuracy, Sensitivity, Specificity, Precision, F1 score and Mathew Correlation Co-efficient (MCC). The study concludes DNN, NN, SVM, RF achieve 100% accuracy and CTWFP achieves accuracy of 87%."

    "abstract": "An abnormally organized brain spatial network is linked to the development of various central nervous system (CNS) disorders, including neurodegenerative diseases and neuropsychiatric disorders. However, the complicated molecular mechanisms of these diseases remain unresolved, making the development of treatment strategies difficult. A novel molecular imaging technique, called mass spectrometry imaging (MSI), captures molecular information on the surface of samples <i>in situ</i>. With MSI, multiple compounds can be simultaneously visualized in a single experiment. The high spatial resolution enables the simultaneous visualization of the spatial distribution and relative content of various compounds. The wide application of MSI in biomedicine has facilitated extensive studies on CNS disorders in recent years. This review provides a concise overview of the processes, applications, advantages, and disadvantages, as well as mechanisms of the main types of MSI. Meanwhile, this review summarizes the main applications of MSI in studying CNS diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), CNS tumors, stroke, depression, Huntington's disease (HD), and Parkinson's disease (PD). Finally, this review comprehensively discusses the synergistic application of MSI with other advanced imaging modalities, its utilization in organoid models, its integration with spatial omics techniques, and provides an outlook on its future potential in single-cell analysis."

    "abstract": "The strongest genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the ε4 allele of apolipoprotein E (ApoE ε4). A high fat diet also adds to the risk of dementia and AD. In addition, there are sex differences as women carriers have a higher risk of an earlier onset and rapid decline in memory than men. The present study looked at the effect of the genetic risk of ApoE ε4 together with a high fat/high sucrose diet (HFD/HSD) on brain function in male and female rats using magnetic resonance imaging. We hypothesized female carriers would present with deficits in cognitive behavior together with changes in functional connectivity as compared to male carriers. Four-month-old wildtype and human ApoE ε4 knock-in (TGRA8960), male and female Sprague Dawley rats were put on a HFD/HSD for four months. Afterwards they were imaged for changes in function using resting state BOLD functional connectivity. Images were registered to, and analyzed, using a 3D MRI rat atlas providing site-specific data on 173 different brain areas. Resting state functional connectivity showed male wildtype had greater connectivity between areas involved in feeding and metabolism while there were no differences between female and male carriers and wildtype females. The data were unexpected. The genetic risk was overshadowed by the diet. Male wildtype rats were most sensitive to the HFD/HSD presenting with a deficit in cognitive performance with enhanced functional connectivity in neural circuitry associated with food consumption and metabolism."

    "title": "Accelerated Simulations Reveal Physicochemical Factors Governing Stability and Composition of RNA Clusters.",
    "abstract": "Under certain conditions, RNA repeat sequences phase separate, yielding protein-free biomolecular condensates. Importantly, RNA repeat sequences have also been implicated in neurological disorders, such as Huntington's disease. Thus, mapping repeat sequences to their phase behavior, functions, and dysfunctions is an active area of research. However, despite several advances, it remains challenging to characterize the RNA phase behavior at a submolecular resolution. Here, we have implemented a residue-resolution coarse-grained model in LAMMPS─that incorporates both the RNA sequence and structure─to study the clustering propensities of protein-free RNA systems. Importantly, we achieve a multifold speedup in the simulation time compared to previous work. Leveraging this efficiency, we study the clustering propensity of all 20 nonredundant trinucleotide repeat sequences. Our results align with findings from experiments, emphasizing that canonical base-pairing and G-U wobble pairs play dominant roles in regulating cluster formation of RNA repeat sequences. Strikingly, we find strong entropic contributions to the stability and composition of RNA clusters, which is demonstrated for single-component RNA systems as well as binary mixtures of trinucleotide repeats. Additionally, we investigate the clustering behaviors of trinucleotide (odd) repeats and their quadranucleotide (even) counterparts. We observe that odd repeats exhibit stronger clustering tendencies, attributed to the presence of consecutive base pairs in their sequences that are disrupted in even repeat sequences. Altogether, our work extends the set of computational tools for probing RNA cluster formation at submolecular resolution and uncovers physicochemical principles that govern the stability and composition of the resulting clusters."

    "abstract": "This paper aims to conduct a systematic review (SR) to assess Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) of malaria-exposed populations for different regions where malaria is endemic, considering any health measurements. An electronic search of the Medline, Lilacs, and Embase databases was conducted until February 2nd, 2024, to identify and select studies that evaluated HRQoL. No restrictions on place or language were made. Thirty-seven studies were included, among them 21 focused on African countries. The most investigated HRQoL outcome associated with malaria was Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs). These studies primarily aim to analyze the epidemiological burden of the disease or to conduct economic assessments. Only four studies conducted field research using specific instruments to assess the HRQoL of individuals experiencing malaria episodes. Three of them estimated EQ-5D utility index and found scores varying from 0.349 for severe malaria (Indonesia) to 0.74 (Nigeria). The health domains that are most affected by malaria are pain and discomfort and usual activities (EQ-5D instrument) and physical domains (WHOQOL-BREF). These results reflect the main malaria symptoms which are fever, headache, and generalized pain. This SR highlights a significant gap in understanding the quality of life among individuals experiencing malaria. Despite being an acute illness, recurrent episodes of malaria can lead to considerable loss in quality of life. Moreover, there are significant equity implications, as malaria remains endemic in socioeconomically disadvantaged populations."

    "abstract": "Dietary strategies for type 2 diabetes (T2DM) prevention have mainly focused on solid foods and nutrients. Emanating evidence suggests that beverage consumption in adulthood may also influence T2DM development, whereas the role of beverages during adolescence remains unknow. To examine adolescent beverages consumption, and their changes from adolescence to adulthood in relation to T2DM risk in adulthood. This prospective cohort study, conducted within the Nurses' Health Study II (NHS II), enrolled 41,317 women who completed a food-frequency questionnaire (FFQ) regarding their diet in high school and had no diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or cancer at baseline (1997). Beverage consumption including coffee, tea, regular or diet soda, fruit juice or milk, was assessed using the FFQ. Cox proportional hazards models were utilized to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for the association between beverage consumption in adolescence and risk of incident type 2 diabetes (T2DM) in adulthood, adjusting for potential confounders. During 725,650 person-years of follow-up, 2,844 participants developed T2DM. After adjustment for demographic, lifestyle and dietary risk factors, comparing ≥ 1 serving/day with non-consumers, adolescent coffee [HR, 0.86 (95% confidence interval: 0.75 to 0.98); P-trend = 0.02)] and orange juice [HR, 0.83 (0.71 to 0.96); P-trend = 0.0008)] consumption was associated with lower T2DM risk, whereas, regular soda [HR, 1.37 (1.20 to 1.57); P-trend < 0.0001)] and iced tea [HR, 1.41 (1.21 to 1.65); P-trend < 0.0001)] intake was associated with higher T2DM risk. Increased coffee intake from adolescence to adulthood in 1991 was associated with a lower T2DM risk [HR, 0.70 (0.61 to 0.80); P-trend < 0.0001), comparing ≥ + 3 servings/day with no change], whereas the opposite was observed for increased regular soda [HR, 1.20 (1.06 to 1.35); P-trend = 0.004), comparing ≥ + 1 or more servings/week with no change)] and diet soda consumption [HR, 1.59 (1.41 to 1.80); P-trend = 0.0002), comparing ≥ + 2 servings/day with no change]. Adolescent consumption of coffee or orange juice intake was associated with a lower risk of T2DM, whereas the opposite was observed for intake of regular soda or iced tea. In addition, increased coffee intake was associated with a lower diabetes risk, whereas the opposite was observed for regular or diet soda intake. These data highlight a potentially important role of beverage intake at early life in the etiology of diabetes during adulthood."

    "abstract": "Huntington's disease (HD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with no cure, characterized by significant neurodegeneration of striatal GABAergic medium spiny neurons (MSNs). Early stages of the disease are characterized by the loss of dopamine 2 receptor-expressing MSNs (D2 MSNs) followed by degeneration of dopamine 1 receptor-expressing MSNs (D1 MSNs), leading to aberrant basal ganglia signaling. While the early degeneration of D2 MSNs and impaired GABAergic transmission are well-documented, potassium chloride cotransporter 2 (KCC2), a key regulator of intracellular chloride (Cl<sup>-</sup>), and therefore GABAergic signaling, has not been characterized in D1 and D2 MSNs in HD. We aimed to investigate whether Cl<sup>-</sup> regulation was differentially altered in D1 and D2 MSNs and may contribute to the early degeneration of D2 MSNs in male and female symptomatic R6/2 mice. We used electrophysiology to record the reversal potential for GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors (<i>E</i> <sub>GABA</sub>), a read-out for the efficacy of Cl<sup>-</sup> regulation, in striatal D1 and D2 MSNs and their corresponding output structures. During the early symptomatic phase (P55-P65), Cl<sup>-</sup> impairments were observed in D2 MSNs in R6/2 mice, with no change in D1 MSNs. Cl<sup>-</sup> regulation was also dysfunctional in the globus pallidus externa, resulting in GABA-mediated excitation. When we overexpressed KCC2 in D2 MSNs using AAV-mediated delivery, we delayed the onset of motor impairments in R6/2 mice. We demonstrate that Cl<sup>-</sup> homeostasis is differentially altered in D1 and D2 MSNs and may contribute to the enhanced susceptibility of D2 MSNs during HD progression."

    "abstract": "In addition to affecting animal health and production, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in livestock can have far-reaching social and economic consequences, including on human health and the environment. Given the diversity of data needs and the absence of standardised methodologies, the scale of antimicrobial use (AMU) and AMR's social and economic burden on livestock is complex to gauge. Yet, quantifying this impact can be an essential input for farm-level decision-making and, more widely, for policy development, public awareness, resource allocation to interventions and research and development prioritisation, particularly in a One Health context. This work proposes a conceptual framework to guide the assessment of the burden of AMU and AMR in livestock using the Global Burden of Animal Diseases (GBADs) approach. Its development identified and mapped critical socio-economic concepts in AMU and AMR in livestock and their relationships. The Animal Health Loss Envelope (AHLE), a monetary metric that sets a boundary for overall losses from health hazards and allows an understanding of the relative importance of health problems in livestock, was used as the metric in which the concepts and data needs for the AMU and AMR assessment were anchored. The proposed framework identifies pathways for losses and data inputs needed to estimate the burden of AMU and AMR within this wider envelope of losses. These include information on health expenditure and mortality and morbidity effects related to AMR in livestock. This work highlights the need for improved health and production data collection in livestock production as an essential stepping stone to accurately producing AMU and AMR burden estimates."

    "abstract": "Post-translational modifications (PTMs) of proteins play a significant role in normal protein function but can also be instrumental in disease pathogenesis. One critical yet under-studied PTM in disease is ubiquitination. Ubiquitin chain addition and substrate specificity are determined by a large spectrum of ubiquitin-ligating and -modifying enzymes, E3 ligases, whose expression levels and activities are tightly regulated in a cell-specific manner. While most ubiquitin chains can target proteins for proteasomal degradation, ubiquitination can contribute to other functions within the cell, including protein localization, protein activity, endocytosis, transcription, and autophagy. One E3 ligase, UBE3A, has garnered much attention because of its involvement in learning and memory, as well as its association with neurodevelopmental autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). However, more recent findings have suggested a potential involvement of UBE3A in neurodegenerative proteinopathies, where reduced UBE3A levels can lead to an enhanced rate of aggregate formation and cell death. Here, we review the literature on UBE3A in neurodevelopment, function, and neurodegenerative diseases and demonstrate that UBE3A could play a critical role in disease progression and cognitive function."

Investigate how socioeconomic status is associated with self-reported psychosocial outcomes, including anxiety, patient activation, and health-related quality of life in stroke survivors using smartwatch for AF detection. We analyzed data from the Pulsewatch study, a randomized controlled trial (NCT03761394). Participants in the intervention group wore a cardiac patch monitor in addition to a smartwatch for AF detection, whereas the control group wore only the cardiac patch monitor. Generalized anxiety disorder-7 scale, Consumer Health Activation Index and short-form health survey were completed to assess anxiety, patient activation, physical and mental health status at baseline, 14, and 44 days. We used a longitudinal linear regression model to examine changes in psychosocial outcomes in low (<$50K) vs. high (>$50K) income groups. A total of 95 participants (average age 64.9± 9.1 years; 57.9% male; 89.5% non-Hispanic white) were included. History of renal disease (p-value 0.029), statin use (p-value 0.034), depression (p-value 0.004), and anxiety (p-value <0.001), were different between the income groups. In the adjusted model, the low-income group was associated with increased anxiety (β 2.75, p-value 0.0003), and decreased physical health status (β -5.07, p-value 0.02). There was no change identified in self-reported patient engagement and mental health status score. Our findings demonstrate that low SES is associated with worse self-reporting of physical health status, and this may influence psychosocial outcomes in smartwatch users."

    "abstract": "Impaired mitochondrial function is crucial to the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases. It causes the release of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS), ATP, and cardiolipin, which activate the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome. NLRP3 inflammasome is an important innate immune system element contributing to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Therefore, targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome has become an interesting therapeutic approach for treating neurodegenerative diseases. This review describes the role of mitochondrial abnormalities and over-activated inflammasomes in the progression of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), Multiple sclerosis (MS), Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Friedrich ataxia (FRDA). We also discuss the therapeutic strategies focusing on signaling pathways associated with inflammasome activation, which potentially alleviate neurodegenerative symptoms and impede disease progression."

AL patients feature either monoclonal free LCs (FLCs) circulating as covalent and noncovalent homodimers, or monoclonal immunoglobulin (Ig) wherein the LC and heavy chain (HC) form disulfide-linked heterodimers, or both. The role of full-length Ig in AL amyloidosis is unclear as prior studies focused on FLC or V<sub>L</sub> domain. We used a mammalian cell-based expression system to generate four AL patient-derived full-length IgGs, two non-AL IgG controls, and six corresponding FLC proteins derived from an IGLV6-57 germline precursor. Comparison of proteins' secondary structure, thermal stability, proteolytic susceptibility, and disulfide link reduction suggested the importance of local vs. global conformational stability. Analysis of IgGs vs. corresponding FLCs using hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry revealed major differences in the local conformation/dynamics of the C<sub>L</sub> domain. In all IgGs vs. FLCs, segments containing β-strand and α-helix βA<sub>C</sub>-αA<sub>C</sub>B<sub>C</sub> were more dynamic/exposed while segment βD<sub>C</sub>-βE<sub>C</sub> was less dynamic/exposed. Notably, these segments overlapped proteolysis-prone regions whose in vivo cleavage generates LC fragments found in AL deposits. Altogether, the results suggest that preferential cleavage in segments βA<sub>C</sub>-αA<sub>C</sub>B<sub>C</sub> of FLC or βD<sub>C</sub>-βE<sub>C</sub> of LC in IgG helps generate amyloid protein precursors. We propose that protecting these segments using small-molecule stabilizers, which bind to the interfacial cavities C<sub>L</sub>-C<sub>L</sub> in FLC and/or C<sub>L</sub>-C<sub>H1</sub> in IgG, is a potential therapeutic strategy to complement current approaches targeting V<sub>L</sub>-V<sub>L</sub> or V<sub>L</sub>-C<sub>L</sub> stabilization of LC dimer."

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) are a type of common chronic progressive disorders characterized by progressive damage to specific cell populations in the nervous system, ultimately leading to disability or death. Effective treatments for these diseases are still lacking, due to a limited understanding of their pathogeneses, which involve multiple cellular and molecular pathways. The triggering of an immune response is a common feature in neurodegenerative disorders. A critical challenge is the intricate interplay between neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration, and immune responses, which are not yet fully characterized. In recent years, the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-stimulator of interferon gene (STING) pathway, a crucial immune response for intracellular DNA sensing, has gradually gained attention. However, the specific roles of this pathway within cellular types such as immune cells, glial and neuronal cells, and its contribution to ND pathogenesis, remain not fully elucidated. In this review, we systematically explore how the cGAS-STING signaling links various cell types with related cellular effector pathways under the context of NDs for multifaceted therapeutic directions. We emphasize the discovery of condition-dependent cellular heterogeneity in the cGAS-STING pathway, which is integral for understanding the diverse cellular responses and potential therapeutic targets. Additionally, we review the pathogenic role of cGAS-STING activation in Parkinson's disease, ataxia-telangiectasia, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. We focus on the complex bidirectional roles of the cGAS-STING pathway in Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, and multiple sclerosis, revealing their double-edged nature in disease progression. The objective of this review is to elucidate the pivotal role of the cGAS-STING pathway in ND pathogenesis and catalyze new insights for facilitating the development of novel therapeutic strategies."

    "abstract": "Protein homeostasis (proteostasis) refers to the plethora of mechanisms that safeguard the proper folding of the newly synthesized proteins. It entails various intricately regulated cues that demolish the toxic protein species to prevent their aggregation. The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is recognized as a salient protein degradation system, with a substantial role in maintaining proteostasis. However, under certain circumstances the protein degradation capacity of the UPS is overwhelmed, leading to the accumulation of misfolded proteins. Several neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis are characterized with the presence of protein aggregates and proteinopathy. Accordingly, enhancing the 26S proteasome degradation activity might delineate a pioneering approach in targeting various proteotoxic disorders. Regrettably, the exact molecular approaches that enhance the proteasomal activity are still not fully understood. Therefore, this review aimed to underscore several signaling cascades that might restore the degradation capacity of this molecular machine. In this review, we discuss the different molecular components of the UPS and how 26S proteasomes are deleteriously affected in many neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, we summarize different signaling pathways that can be utilized to renovate the 26S proteasome functional capacity, alongside currently known druggable targets in this circuit and various classes of proteasome activators."

PLPs exhibit bioactivity in HD mouse striatal cells by successfully inhibiting mitochondrial destruction. PLP is notably resilient to in vitro enzyme, serum, and liver microsome stability assays, which render analogous control oligopeptides ineffective. PLP demonstrates a 2000-fold increase in circulation half-life compared to peptides, exhibiting an elimination half-life of 152 hours. In vivo efficacy studies in HD transgenic mice (R6/2) confirm the superior bioactivity of PLP compared to free peptide through behavioral and neuropathological analyses. PLP functions by preventing pathologic VCP/mtHtt binding in HD animal models; exhibits enhanced efficacy over the parent, free peptide; and implicates the PLP as a platform with potential for translational central nervous system therapeutics."

We generated a dataset of 3,762 3D-reconstructed and reference-atlas mapped striatal D1- and D2- medium spiny neurons (MSNs). Integrative morphometric analyses reveal distinct impacts of anatomical locations and D1/D2 genetic types on MSN morphologies. To analyze striatal regional features of MSN dendrites without prior anatomical constraints, we assigned MSNs to a lattice of cubic boxes in the reference brain atlas, and summarized morphometric representation (\"eigen-morph\") for each box and clustered boxes with shared morphometry. This analysis reveals 6 modules with characteristic dendritic features and spanning contiguous striatal territories, each receiving distinct corticostriatal inputs. Finally, we found aging confers robust dendritic length and branching defects in MSNs, while Huntington's disease (HD) mice exhibit selective length-related defects. Together, our study demonstrates a systems-biology approach to profile dendritic morphology of genetically-defined single-neurons; and defines novel striatal D1/D2-MSN morphological territories and aging- or HD-associated pathologies."

We tracked TE small RNAs (smRNAs) expression landscape to assess the relationship to the active processing from TE long RNAs (lnRNAs). Human brain transcriptomes from the BrainSpan Atlas displayed a significant shift of TE smRNA patterns at age 20 years, whereas aging mouse brains lacked any such marked change, despite clear shift in aging-associated mRNA levels. Human frontal cortex displayed pronounced sense TE smRNAs during aging with a negative relationship between the TE smRNAs and lnRNAs indicative of age associated regulatory effects. Our analysis revealed TE smRNAs dysregulation in HD, while PD showed a stronger impact on TE lnRNAs, potentially correlating with the early average age of death for HD relative to PD. Furthermore, TE-silencing factor TRIM28 was down-regulated only in aging human brains, possibly explaining the lack of substantial TE RNA changes in aging mouse brains. Our study suggests brain TE RNAs may serve as novel biomarkers of human brain aging and neurodegenerative disorders."

Although limited, the current literature on psychological care for people with HD shows that interventions have the potential to drive improvements in mental health and quality of life. However, the experience of accessing and receiving psychological support for HD remains unclear across several countries. This study adopted a qualitative design to explore the experiences of psychological support for HD from the perspectives of patients and caregivers living in Italy. Semi-structured interviews were carried out with 14 participants-7 patients with early-manifest HD and 7 partners acting as their caregivers. The resulting data were analysed through thematic analysis. Four overarching themes were identified: (1) the availability of psychological support for HD, (2) barriers to accessing psychological support, (3) enablers to accessing psychological support, and (4) the future development of public psychological provision for HD. In Italy, patients and caregivers perceive public psychological support for HD as unavailable or inadequate, and private therapy is often seen as unaffordable. Barriers such as distrust in public healthcare and preconceptions about therapy may limit access, while advice from HD organisations and seeking therapy for other reasons may act as enablers. A strong emphasis is put on the need for accessible public psychological support throughout all the stages of the condition."

    "title": "Role of Thrombosis in Neurodegenerative Diseases: An Intricate Mechanism of Neurovascular Complications.",
    "abstract": "Thrombosis, the formation of blood clots in arteries or veins, poses a significant health risk by disrupting the blood flow. It can potentially lead to major cardiovascular complications such as acute myocardial infarction or ischemic stroke (arterial thrombosis) and deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism (venous thrombosis). Nevertheless, over the course of several decades, researchers have observed an association between different cardiovascular events and neurodegenerative diseases, which progressively harm and impair parts of the nervous system, particularly the brain. Furthermore, thrombotic complications have been identified in numerous clinical instances of neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and Huntington's disease. Substantial research indicates that endothelial dysfunction, vascular inflammation, coagulation abnormalities, and platelet hyperactivation are commonly observed in these conditions, collectively contributing to an increased risk of thrombosis. Thrombosis can, in turn, contribute to the onset, pathogenesis, and severity of these neurological disorders. Hence, this concise review comprehensively explores the correlation between cardiovascular diseases and neurodegenerative diseases, elucidating the cellular and molecular mechanisms of thrombosis in these neurodegenerative diseases. Additionally, a detailed discussion is provided on the commonly employed antithrombotic medications in the context of these neuronal diseases."

    "title": "Neurexin1 level in Huntington's Disease and decreased Neurexin1 in disease progression.",
    "abstract": "Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the presence of abnormally expanded polyglutamine tracts in huntingtin protein (HTT). Mutant HTT disrupts synaptic transmission and plasticity, particularly in the striatum and cortex, leading to early dysfunctions, such as altered neurotransmitter release, impaired synaptic vesicle recycling, and disrupted postsynaptic receptor function. Synaptic loss precedes neuronal degeneration and contributes to disease progression. Neurexin1 (NRXN1), a synaptic cell adhesion molecule primarily located in the presynaptic membrane, plays a crucial role in maintaining synaptic integrity. The present study investigated the role of NRXN1 in HD. This study researched whether the changed level has been related to expanded polyQ stretch and disease progression. Here, we report a reduction in NRXN1 levels in post-symptomatic HD mice and in neuronal cells expressing abnormally expanded polyQ tracts. Mutant HTT was found to decrease NRXN1 levels while increasing LAMP2A levels, which promotes lysosomal degradation of NRXN1. In HD cells expressing Q111, downregulated LAMP2A restored NRXN1 levels and maintained cell proliferation compared with cells expressing Q7. These findings suggest that NRXN1 is regulated by LAMP2A-mediated way and that decreased NRXN1 levels are associated with symptomatic progression and neuronal cell loss in HD."

    "abstract": "Cervical cancer is the third leading cause of cancer-related death in women worldwide. Nearly all cases of cervical cancer are due to infection with human papillomavirus (HPV). Nowarta110 has shown breakthrough therapeutic efficacy in phase II clinical study against plantar warts, with no reported side effects. This study evaluated the effectiveness of Nowarta110 in killing cultured HPV-transformed cancer cells and its anti-cancer effects in mice, using both vaginally engrafted and subcutaneously implanted animal cancer models. Nowarta110 is a novel compound composed of colloidal silver and fig extract. The cytotoxic properties of Nowarta110 were evaluated on HPV-16 and HPV-18-transformed human cancer cells (ARPE-19/HPV-16 and HeLa cells, respectively). The therapeutic potential of Nowarta110 in vivo was evaluated following the engraftment of ME-180 epidermoid carcinoma cells in the mouse vagina or their subcutaneous implantation. Nowarta110 treatment was initiated when the tumor reached an approximate volume of 65 mm<sup>3</sup> Results: Our data showed that HPV16-expressing human retinal pigmented epithelial cells are susceptible to Nowarta110-induced cell death, with a reduction in cell viability observed at 1% Nowarta110 and a complete absence of viable cells at 5% Nowarta110. In HPV18-expressing HeLa cells, Nowarta110 caused significant and rapid cell death at a dose of 5%, whereas lower doses of 1% did not produce the same effects. The results from animal studies indicated that Nowarta110 effectively induced tumor regression in both the intravaginal and subcutaneous tumor models. Nowarta110 effectively induced cell death in HPV-16 and HPV-18-transformed human cancer cells. It also effectively induced tumor regression in mouse models with intravaginally engrafted or subcutaneously implanted cancer cells. Considering the high prevalence of HPV-induced cervical dysplasia and cancer and the lack of treatment, clinical studies to promote the implementation of Nowarta110 are warranted."

    "title": "Randomized Trial of Telegenetic Counseling for Gene Testing in Huntington Disease.",
    "abstract": "The purpose of the study was to determine the feasibility and patient satisfaction of telegenetic counseling, or counseling done by video, for Huntington disease (HD). Background: Genetic counseling is necessary for presymptomatic or symptomatic HD genetic testing, but the lack of access to counseling because of geography or expense is a critical gap for many patients. The hypothesis of this study was that there would be no difference in patient satisfaction between telegenetic counseling (tele-GC) or in-person counseling (in-person GC) for HD testing. This was a prospective, randomized, unblinded study of either tele-GC or in-person GC for HD gene testing. Participants had standardized genetic counseling in the clinic or through a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) appropriate telemedicine platform first and then crossed over. A study coordinator interviewed the participant using a telehealth survey after each encounter. A total of 19 in-person GC and 15 tele-GC participants were included: 68% women, 41 ± 15 years, 80% White, 10% Hispanic, and +CAG repeat length = 45 ± 4.4 (n = 15) (<i>p</i> > 0.1). All participants were satisfied with their initial counseling experience when asked to rate on a scale of 1-10 (median 10/10, <i>p</i> = 0.94). The majority of symptomatic HD participants (5/7) preferred in-person GC. The main advantage of tele-GC was reduction in travel time for both in-person GC first (n = 16) and tele-GC first (n = 11) participants. Technical challenges were encountered in many of the participants. Visually seeing the genetic counselor improved understanding for in-person GC (n = 10) and tele-GC (n = 8) participants. Participants felt they were able to pick up on emotional cues (n = 33) and felt comfortable asking questions (n = 34) using the tele-GC format. Telegenetic counseling is a feasible option for HD gene testing, if patients are able to overcome technical issues. Having a video visit with both audio and video components, rather than an audio-only phone call, should be considered when using telegenetic counseling for HD. Finally, in-person counseling may be preferred to increase understanding of the genetic counseling materials in patients, especially in motor manifest HD."

    "abstract": "Cognitive impairments, which can be caused by neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular disease, represent a growing global health crisis with far-reaching implications for individuals, families, healthcare systems, and economies worldwide. Notably, neurodegenerative-induced cognitive impairment often presents a different pattern and severity compared to cerebrovascular-induced cognitive impairment. With the development of computational technology, machine learning techniques have developed rapidly, which offers a powerful tool in radiomic analysis, allowing a more comprehensive model that can handle high-dimensional, multivariate data compared to the traditional approach. Such models allow the prediction of the disease development, as well as accurately classify disease from overlapping symptoms, therefore facilitating clinical decision making. This review will focus on the application of machine learning-based radiomics on cognitive impairment caused by neurogenerative and cerebrovascular disease. Within the neurodegenerative category, this review primarily focuses on Alzheimer's disease, while also covering other conditions such as Parkinson's disease, Lewy body dementia, and Huntington's disease. In the cerebrovascular category, we concentrate on poststroke cognitive impairment, including ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, with additional attention given to small vessel disease and moyamoya disease. We also review the specific challenges and limitations when applying machine learning radiomics, and provide our suggestion to overcome those limitations towards the end, and discuss what could be done for future clinical use."

Recent evidence strongly suggests the involvement of ferroptosis in various neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), particularly Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), multiple sclerosis (MS), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), among others. The treatment of ferroptosis poses both opportunities and challenges in the context of ND. This review provides a comprehensive overview of characteristic features, induction and inhibition of ferroptosis, highlighting the ferroptosis inhibitor and the underlying mechanisms responsible for its occurrence. Moreover, the review explores how these mechanisms contribute to the pathogenesis and progression of major neurodegenerative disorders. Additionally, it presents novel insights into the role of ferroptosis in ND and summarizes recent advancements in the development of therapeutic approaches targeting ferroptosis. These insights and advancements hold potential to guide future strategies aimed at effectively managing these debilitating medical conditions."

    "abstract": "Resonance and synchronized rhythm are significant phenomena observed in dynamical systems in nature, particularly in biological contexts. These phenomena can either enhance or disrupt system functioning. Numerous examples illustrate the necessity for organs within the human body to maintain their rhythmic patterns for proper operation. For instance, in the brain, synchronized or desynchronized electrical activities can contribute to neurodegenerative conditions like Huntington's disease. In this paper, we utilize the well-established Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) model, which describes the propagation of action potentials in neurons through conductance-based mechanisms. Employing a \"data-driven\" approach alongside the outputs of the HH model, we introduce an innovative technique termed \"dynamic entrainment.\" This technique leverages deep learning methodologies to dynamically sustain the system within its entrainment regime. Our findings show that the results of the dynamic entrainment technique match with the outputs of the mechanistic (HH) model."

    "abstract": "Although genetic interventions are on the horizon for some polyglutamine expansion diseases, such as subtypes of spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) and Huntington's disease (HD), the patients' preferences regarding these new therapies are unclear. This study aims to get insight into what extent different characteristics of genetic interventions affect the preferences of patients with SCA and HD with regard to these interventions. Manifest and premanifest patients with SCA or HD were recruited online by platforms of patient associations. The respondents conducted a questionnaire that included a discrete choice experiment (DCE). The experimental design included 24 choice sets, but these were divided into three blocks of eight to reduce the number of tasks per respondent. Each choice set included two alternative treatments and consisted of four attributes (mode and frequency of administration, chance of a beneficial effect, risks, and follow-up), each with three or four different levels. The forced choice-elicitation format was used. Data were analyzed by using a multinominal logistic regression model. Responses of 216 participants were collected. The mode and frequency of administration of a genetic intervention, as well as the chance of a beneficial effect both influence the choice for a genetic intervention. Respondents less prefer repeated lumbar punctures compared to a single operation. As expected, a higher beneficial effect of treatment was preferred. Risks and follow-up did not influence the choice for a genetic intervention. The results can be used for the design and implementation of future genetic interventional trials as well as of patient-centered care pathways for rare movement disorders such as SCA and HD."

It was previously reported that QA exerted antioxidant and neuroprotective activity against dementia. However, it was not tested for its neuroprotective potential against Huntington's disease (HD). Since aging related disorders are greatly linked to oxidative stress conditions, we focused on testing the oxidative stress resistant activity and protective effect of QA against the development of HD by using the multicellular Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) worm model. Firstly, QA was tested for its oxidative stress resistant properties. In survival assay, wild type and mutant skn-1 and daf-16 worms were exposed to oxidative stress conditions by using H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Activation of SKN-1 pathway and expression of its downstream genes gcs-1 and gst-4 were also tested. Secondly, the effect of QA was evaluated on HD by testing its ability to decrease the formation of polyQ150 aggregates. Furthermore, its effect on the accumulation of polyglutamine (polyQ35 and polyQ40 aggregates) was tested. Here we report that QA could improve the survival of C. elegans after exposure to oxidative stress caused by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> while also exerting antioxidant effects through the activation of SKN-1/Nrf2 pathway. Moreover, QA could be a potential candidate to protect against HD due to its effects on decreasing the formation of polyQ150, polyQ35 and polyQ40 aggregates. This study highlights the importance of QA as a natural compound in defending against oxidative stress and the development of neurodegenerative diseases like HD."

    "abstract": "Identifying initial triggering events in neurodegenerative disorders is critical to developing preventive therapies. In Huntington's disease (HD), hyperdopaminergia-probably triggered by the dysfunction of the most affected neurons, indirect pathway spiny projection neurons (iSPNs)-is believed to induce hyperkinesia, an early stage HD symptom. However, how this change arises and contributes to HD pathogenesis is unclear. Here, we demonstrate that genetic disruption of iSPNs function by Ntrk2/Trkb deletion in mice results in increased striatal dopamine and midbrain dopaminergic neurons, preceding hyperkinetic dysfunction. Transcriptomic analysis of iSPNs at the pre-symptomatic stage showed de-regulation of metabolic pathways, including upregulation of Gsto2, encoding glutathione S-transferase omega-2 (GSTO2). Selectively reducing Gsto2 in iSPNs in vivo effectively prevented dopaminergic dysfunction and halted the onset and progression of hyperkinetic symptoms. This study uncovers a functional link between altered iSPN BDNF-TrkB signalling, glutathione-ascorbate metabolism and hyperdopaminergic state, underscoring the vital role of GSTO2 in maintaining dopamine balance."

The objective of this method is to enhance the precision of diagnosing neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Parkinson's disease (PD), and Huntington's disease (HD), through the introduction of a novel approach to analyze gait patterns. The research evaluates the CNN-based classification approach using QR-represented gait data to address the diagnostic challenges associated with neurodegenerative diseases. The gait data of subjects were converted into QR codes, which were then classified using a CNN deep learning model. The dataset includes recordings from patients with Parkinson's disease (n = 15), Huntington's disease (n = 20), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (n = 13), and from 16 healthy controls. The accuracy rates obtained through 10-fold cross-validation were as follows: 94.86% for NDD versus control, 95.81% for PD versus control, 93.56% for HD versus control, 97.65% for ALS versus control, and 84.65% for PD versus HD versus ALS versus control. These results demonstrate the potential of the proposed system in distinguishing between different neurodegenerative diseases and control groups. The results indicate that the designed system may serve as a complementary tool for the diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases, particularly in individuals who already present with varying degrees of motor impairment. Further validation and research are needed to establish its wider applicability."

    "title": "Corticostriatal Maldevelopment in the R6/2 Mouse Model of Juvenile Huntington's Disease.",
    "abstract": "There is a growing consensus that brain development in Huntington's disease (HD) is abnormal, leading to the idea that HD is not only a neurodegenerative but also a neurodevelopmental disorder. Indeed, structural and functional abnormalities have been observed during brain development in both humans and animal models of HD. However, a concurrent study of cortical and striatal development in a genetic model of HD is still lacking. Here we report significant alterations of corticostriatal development in the R6/2 mouse model of juvenile HD. We examined wildtype (WT) and R6/2 mice at postnatal (P) days 7, 14, and 21. Morphological examination demonstrated early structural and cellular alterations reminiscent of malformations of cortical development, and <i>ex vivo</i> electrophysiological recordings of cortical pyramidal neurons (CPNs) demonstrated significant age- and genotype-dependent changes of intrinsic membrane and synaptic properties. In general, R6/2 CPNs had reduced cell membrane capacitance and increased input resistance (P7 and P14), along with reduced frequency of spontaneous excitatory and inhibitory synaptic events during early development (P7), suggesting delayed cortical maturation. This was confirmed by increased occurrence of GABA <sub>A</sub> receptor-mediated giant depolarizing potentials at P7. At P14, the rheobase of CPNs was significantly reduced, along with increased excitability. Altered membrane and synaptic properties of R6/2 CPNs recovered progressively, and by P21 they were similar to WT CPNs. In striatal medium-sized spiny neurons (MSNs), a different picture emerged. Intrinsic membrane properties were relatively normal throughout development, except for a transient increase in membrane capacitance at P14. The first alterations in MSNs synaptic activity were observed at P14 and consisted of significant deficits in GABAergic inputs, however, these also were normalized by P21. In contrast, excitatory inputs began to decrease at this age. We conclude that the developing HD brain is capable of compensating for early developmental abnormalities and that cortical alterations precede and are a main contributor of striatal changes. Addressing cortical maldevelopment could help prevent or delay disease manifestations."

    "abstract": "Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disease resulting in devastating motor, cognitive, and psychiatric deficits. The striatum is a brain region that controls movement and some forms of cognition and is most significantly impacted in HD. However, despite well-documented deficits in learning and memory in HD, knowledge of the potential implication of other brain regions such as the hippocampus remains limited. Here, we study the comparative impact of enhanced mHTT aggregation and neuropathology in the striatum and hippocampus of two HD mouse models. We utilized the zQ175 as a control HD mouse model and the Q175DN mice lacking the PGK-Neomycin cassette generated in house. We performed a comparative characterization of the neuropathology between zQ175 and Q175DN mice in the striatum and the hippocampus by assessing HTT aggregation, neuronal and glial pathology, chaperone expression, and synaptic density. We showed that Q175DN mice presented enhanced mHTT aggregation in both striatum and hippocampus compared to zQ175. Striatal neurons showed a greater susceptibility to enhanced accumulation of mHTT than hippocampal neurons in Q175DN despite high levels of mHTT in both regions. Contrary to the pathology seen in the striatum, Q175DN hippocampus presented enhanced spare capacity showing increased synaptic density, decreased Iba1<sup>+</sup> microglia density and enhanced HSF1 levels in specific subregions of the hippocampus compared to zQ175. Q175DN mice are a valuable tool to understand the fundamental susceptibility differences to mHTT toxicity between striatal neurons and other neuronal subtypes. Furthermore, our findings also suggest that cognitive deficits observed in HD animals might arise from either striatum dysfunction or other regions involved in cognitive processes but not from hippocampal degeneration."

This review highlights how miRNA dysregulation can illuminate the molecular pathways of these diseases and potentially serve as biomarkers for early diagnosis and prognosis. Specifically, miRNAs' ability to target genes critical to the pathology of neurodegenerative diseases, their role in the development of trinucleotide repeat and neurodevelopmental disorders, and their distinctive patterns in SCZ and mood disorders are discussed. The review also stresses the value of miRNAs in precision neuropsychiatry, where they could predict treatment outcomes and aid in disease management. Furthermore, the study of conserved miRNAs in model organisms like Drosophila underscores their broad utility and provides deeper mechanistic insights into their biological functions. This comprehensive examination of miRNAs across various conditions advocates for their integration into clinical practice, promising advancements in personalized healthcare for neurological and psychiatric conditions."

However, the absence of a baseline assessment of knowledge, skills, and attitudes (KSAs) of practicing nurses' capacity for PH hinders its integration. The purpose of this study is to determine the capacity of practicing Registered Nurses (RNs) for PH across the United States and to assess the validity and reliability of a tool designed for this use-the Precision Health Nurse Capacity Scale (PHNCS). A descriptive exploratory study was conducted to evaluate the capacity of practicing RNs for this evolving phenomenon, PH, using a convenience sample. The survey was sent via email and made available to all members of the American Nurses Association (ANA) who work in a variety of practice environments. The ANA represents the over 4 million nurses practicing in the United States. The majority of nurse respondents felt it is important for nurses to become more educated about all aspects of PH including SDoH but they lack confidence in the integration of PH. The PHNCS was found to be a valid and reliable tool in measuring the capacity of nurses to practice PH. The incorporation of PH into nursing practice suffers an immediate impediment: the lack of know-how of the US nursing workforce. This inaugural data on KSAs for PH establishes a logical baseline from which the requisite education and training should commence. Precision Health is an emerging healthcare approach in the United States and globally. Enabling it will require a nursing workforce prepared with the requisite KSAs.

The field of research on the gut-brain axis has grown significantly during the past two decades. Signalling occurs between the gut microbiota and the brain through the neural, endocrine, immune, and humoral pathways.

Furthermore, the bidirectional correlation between therapeutics and the gut-brain axis will be discussed. Conversely, the mood of delivery, exercise, psychotropic agents, stress, and neurologic drugs can influence the MGBA.

    "abstract": "Malabsorption of NaCl is the primary cause of diarrhea in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Coupled NaCl absorption occurs via the dual operation of Na:H and Cl:HCO<sub>3</sub> exchange in the brush border membrane (BBM) of villus cells. Cl:HCO<sub>3</sub> exchange is mediated by BBM transporters DRA (downregulated in adenoma) and PAT1 (putative anion transporter 1) in the mammalian small intestine. DRA/PAT1-mediated Cl:HCO<sub>3</sub> exchange was significantly downregulated in the BBM of villus cells in a rabbit model of chronic ileitis, while Na:H exchange was unaffected. The inhibition of Cl:HCO<sub>3</sub> exchange was restored in the rabbits when treated with a broad-spectrum immunomodulator, i.e. a glucocorticoid, indicating that the downregulation of DRA/PAT1 is likely to be immune-mediated during chronic enteritis. Mucosal mast cells are one type of key immune cells that are known to proliferate and release immune inflammatory mediators, thus playing a significant role in the pathogenesis of IBD. However, how mast cells may regulate DRA- and PAT1-mediated Cl:HCO<sub>3</sub> exchange in a rabbit model of chronic ileitis is unknown. In this study, treatment of rabbits with chronic intestinal inflammation with the mast cell stabilizer ketotifen did not affect the mucosal architecture of the inflamed intestine. However, ketotifen treatment reversed the inhibition of Cl:HCO<sub>3</sub> activity in the BBM of villus cells. This restoration of Cl:HCO<sub>3</sub> activity to normal levels by ketotifen was found to be secondary to restoring the affinity of the exchangers for its substrate chloride. This observation was consistent with molecular studies, where the mRNA and BBM protein expressions of DRA and PAT1 remained unaffected in the villus cells under all experimental conditions. Thus, this study indicates that mast cells mediated the inhibition of coupled NaCl absorption by inhibiting Cl:HCO<sub>3</sub> exchange in a rabbit model of chronic enteritis."

To assess the attributable burden of injury risk factors, the data of interest on data sources were retrieved from the Global Health Data Exchange (GHDx) and analyzed. Cause-specific death from injuries was estimated using the Cause of Death Ensemble model in the GBD 2019. The burden attributable to each injury risk factor was incorporated in the population attributable fraction to estimate the total attributable deaths and disability-adjusted life years. The Socio-demographic Index (SDI) was used to evaluate countries' developmental status. Globally, there were 713.9 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI]: 663.8 to 766.9) injuries incidence and 4.3 million (UI: 3.9 to 4.6) deaths caused by injuries in 2019. There was an inverse relationship between age-standardized disability-adjusted life year rate and SDI quintiles in 2019. Overall, low bone mineral density was the leading risk factor of injury deaths in 2019, with a contribution of 10.5% (UI: 9.0 to 11.6) of total injuries and age-standardized deaths, followed by occupational risks (7.0% [UI: 6.3-7.9]) and alcohol use (6.8% [UI: 5.2 to 8.5]). Various risks were responsible for the imposed burden of injuries. This study highlighted the small but persistent share of injuries in the global burden of diseases and injuries to provide beneficial data to produce proper policies to reach an effective global injury prevention plan."

    "abstract": "Neurological diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs), are the primary cause of disability worldwide and the second leading cause of death. The chronic nature of these conditions and the lack of disease-modifying therapies highlight the urgent need for developing effective therapies. To accomplish this, effective models of NDDs are required to increase our understanding of underlying pathophysiology and for evaluating treatment efficacy. Traditionally, models of NDDs have focused on the central nervous system (CNS). However, evidence points to a relationship between systemic factors and the development of NDDs. Cardiovascular disease and related risk factors have been shown to modify the cerebral vasculature and the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. These findings, combined with reports of changes to vascular density and blood-brain barrier integrity in other NDDs, such as Huntington's disease and Parkinson's disease, suggest that cardiovascular health may be predictive of brain function. To evaluate this, we explore evidence for disruptions to the circulatory system in murine models of NDDs, evidence of disruptions to the CNS in cardiovascular disease models and summarize models combining cardiovascular disruption with models of NDDs. In this study, we aim to increase our understanding of cardiovascular disease and neurodegeneration interactions across multiple disease states and evaluate the utility of combining model systems."

    "title": "Overcoming Graft Rejection in Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Inhibitory Interneurons for Drug-Resistant Epilepsy.",
    "abstract": "Cell-based therapies for drug-resistant epilepsy using induced pluripotent stem cell-derived inhibitory interneurons are now in early-phase clinical trials, building on findings from trials in Parkinson's disease (PD) and Huntington's disease (HD). Graft rejection and the need for immunosuppressive therapy post-transplantation pose potential barriers to more epilepsy patients becoming potential candidates for inhibitory interneurons transplantation surgery. The present literature review weighs the evidence for and against human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-mediated graft rejection in PD and HD and examines the potential advantages and drawbacks to five broad approaches to cell-based therapies, including autologous cell culture and transplantation, in vivo reprogramming of glial cells using viral vectors, allogeneic transplantation using off-the-shelf cell lines, transplantation using inhibitory interneurons cultured from HLA-matched cell lines, and the use of hypoimmunogenic-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived inhibitory interneurons. The impact of surgical technique and associated needle trauma on graft rejection is also discussed. Non-systematic literature review. While cell-based therapies have enjoyed early successes in treating a host of central nervous system disorders, the immunologic reaction against surgical procedures and implanted materials has remained a major obstacle. Adapting cell-based therapies using iPSC-derived inhibitory interneurons for epilepsy surgery will similarly require surmounting the challenge of immunogenicity."

    "title": "The Emerging Role of Phosphodiesterase 5 Inhibition in Neurological Disorders: The State of the Art.",
    "abstract": "Growing evidence suggests that neuroinflammation is not just a consequence of neurodegeneration in pathologies such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease or Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, but it is rather a determinant factor, which plays a pivotal role in the onset and progression of these disorders. Neuroinflammation can affect cells and processes in the central nervous system (CNS) as well as immune cells, and might precede protein aggregation, which is a hallmark of the neurodegenerative process. Standard treatment methods are far from being able to counteract inflammation and delay neurodegeneration. Remarkably, phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors (PDE5is), which represent potent vasoactive drugs used as a first-line treatment for erectile dysfunction (ED), display important anti-inflammatory effects through cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) level stabilization. Since PDE5 hydrolyzes cGMP, several studies positioned PDE5 as a therapeutic target, and more specifically, PDE5is as potential alternative strategies for the treatment of a variety of neurological disorders. Indeed, PDE5is can limit neuroinflammation and enhance synaptic plasticity, with beneficial effects on cognitive function and memory. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of some of the main processes underlying neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration which may be potential targets for PDE5is, focusing on sildenafil, the most extensively studied. Current strategies using PDEis for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases will be summarized."

    "title": "Dual Role of Anionic Lipids in Amyloid Aggregation.",
    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's, affect millions worldwide and share a common feature: the aggregation of intrinsically disordered proteins into toxic oligomers that interact with cell membranes. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides accumulate and bind to plasma membranes, potentially disrupting cellular function. The complex interplay between amyloidogenic peptides and lipid membranes, particularly the role of anionic lipids, is crucial in disease pathogenesis but challenging to characterize experimentally. The literature presents conflicting results on the influence of anionic lipids on peptide aggregation kinetics, highlighting a knowledge gap. To address this, we used coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CG-MD) simulations to study interactions between a model amyloidogenic peptide, amyloid-β's K<sub>16</sub>LVFFAE<sub>22</sub> fragment (Aβ<sub>16-22</sub>), and mixed lipid bilayers. We used phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylcholine (PC) as representative anionic and zwitterionic lipids, respectively, examining the mixed bilayer compositions of 0% PS-100% PC, 10% PS-90% PC, and 30% PS-70% PC. Our simulations revealed that membranes enriched in anionic lipids enhance peptide adsorption and interaction kinetics. The aggregation dynamics was modulated by two competing factors: increased local peptide concentration near negatively charged membranes, which promoted aggregation, and peptide-lipid interactions, which slowed it down. Higher percentages of anionic lipids led to smaller and more ordered aggregates and enhanced lipid demixing, leading to the formation of PS clusters. These findings contribute to understanding membrane-mediated peptide aggregation in neurodegenerative disorders, potentially guiding new therapeutic strategies targeting the early stages of protein aggregation in various neurodegenerative diseases."

    "abstract": "UBL3 (Ubiquitin-like 3) is a protein that plays a crucial role in post-translational modifications, particularly in regulating protein transport within small extracellular vesicles. While previous research has predominantly focused on its interactions with α-synuclein, this study investigates UBL3's role in Huntington's disease (HD). HD is characterized by movement disorders and cognitive impairments, with its pathogenesis linked to toxic, polyglutamine (polyQ)-expanded mutant huntingtin fragments (mHTT). However, the mechanisms underlying the interaction between UBL3 and mHTT remain poorly understood. To elucidate this relationship, we performed hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining and immunohistochemistry (IHC) on postmortem brain tissue from HD patients. Gaussia princeps-based split-luciferase complementation assay and co-immunoprecipitation were employed to confirm the interaction between UBL3 and mHTT. Additionally, we conducted a HiBiT lytic detection assay to assess the influence of UBL3 on the intracellular sorting of mHTT. Finally, immunocytochemical staining was utilized to validate the colocalization and distribution of these proteins. Our findings revealed UBL3-positive inclusions in the cytoplasm and nuclei of neurons throughout the striatum of HD patients. We discovered that UBL3 colocalizes and interacts with mHTT and modulates its intracellular sorting. These results suggest that UBL3 may play a significant role in the interaction and sorting of mHTT, contributing to the understanding of its potential implications in the pathophysiology of Huntington's disease."

    "abstract": "Li<sup>+</sup> based drugs have been used for the treatment of psychiatric disorders due to their mood stabilizing role for decades. Recently, several studies reported the protective effect of Li<sup>+</sup> against severe neuropathologies such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and Huntington's disease. Surprisingly, despite a broad range of Li<sup>+</sup> effects on neurological conditions, little is known about its molecular mechanism. In this study, we propose that neuronal calcium sensor 1 (NCS1), can be an effective molecular target for Li<sup>+</sup> action. Here we show that the EF-hands in ApoNCS1 have submillimolar affinity for Li<sup>+</sup> with K<sub>d</sub> = 223 ± 19 μM. Li<sup>+</sup> binding to ApoNCS1 quenches Trp emission intensity, suggesting distinct Trp sidechains environment in Li<sup>+</sup>NCS1 compared to ApoNCS1 and Ca<sup>2+</sup>NCS1. Li<sup>+</sup> association also stabilizes the protein α-helical structure, in a similar way to Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Li<sup>+</sup> association does not promote NCS1 dimerization. Association of Li<sup>+</sup> increases NCS1 affinity for the D2R receptor binding peptide, in a similar way to Ca<sup>2+</sup>, however, the affinity of NCS1 for chlorpromazine is reduced with respect to Ca<sup>2+</sup>NCS1, possibly due to a decrease in solvent exposed hydrophobic area on the NCS1 surface in the presence of Li<sup>+</sup>. MD simulation data suggests that Li<sup>+</sup> ions are coordinated by four oxygens from Asp and Glu sidechains and one carbonyl oxygen, in a similar way as reported previously for Li<sup>+</sup> binding to DREAM. Overall, the data shows that Li<sup>+</sup> binds to EF-hands of NCS1 and Li<sup>+</sup>NCS1 interactions may be involved in the potential neuroprotective role of Li<sup>+</sup> against psychotic disorders."

    "abstract": "Despite the wide use of dopamine receptor blocking agents (DRBAs) in Huntington disease (HD), neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is rarely described in this population. The aim of this study was to assess NMS prevalence in a large cohort of HD patients and explore the main associated risk factors. In 2023, an HD patient was admitted to our neurology department due to NMS. Starting from the case description, we performed a narrative review of the literature of NMS cases in HD, reviewed data from the fifth dataset of the Enroll-HD (a longitudinal, observational, global study of families with HD) study (PDS5) selecting HD patients treated with DRBAs and/or tetrabenazine (TBZ) who presented at least one of the core symptoms of NMS (rigidity and hyperthermia), and collected data to investigate prevalence of NMS and identify risk factors. In the Enroll-HD PDS5 dataset, we identified 5108 of 11,569 HD patients who were undergoing DRBA and/or TBZ treatment. Only one patient, a Caucasian man of 46 years, undergoing clozapine and valproate treatment, had a registered diagnosis of NMS. NMS in HD patients is seldom described. This could be due to an underestimation of this condition. There are no available objective NMS diagnostic criteria at present, and the existence of atypical forms of NMS further complicates diagnosis. Advanced disease stage, rigid-akinetic phenotype, abrupt therapy changes, polytherapy, and dehydration are key risk factors, most of which are preventable through awareness and caution in managing medications in the HD population."

This study examines their clinical characteristics and investigates the genetic causes of HDPC. Clinical data from neurogenetics clinics and HDPC gene-panel data were analysed. Additionally, a subset of 50 patients with HDPC underwent whole-genome sequencing (WGS) analysed via Expansion Hunter and Ingenuity Variant Analysis. HDPC prevalence was estimated at 2.3-2.9 per 100 000. No clinical discriminators between patients with HD and HDPC could be identified. In the gene-panel data, deleterious variants and potentially deleterious variants were over-represented in cases versus controls. WGS analysis identified one <i>ATXN1</i> expansion in a patient with HDPC. The HDPC phenotype is consistent with HD, but the genotype is distinct. Both established deleterious variants and novel potentially deleterious variants in genes related to neurodegeneration contribute to HDPC."

    "abstract": "Thymidine phosphorylase (TYMP), which facilitates platelet activation and thrombosis, is significantly increased in COVID-19 patients. We hypothesize that TYMP mediates SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (SP)-induced thrombosis. Plasmids encoding wildtype SP or empty vector (p3.1) were transfected into COS-7 cells, and cell lysates were prepared as a reservoir for SP or p3.1 (control), respectively. K18-hACE2<sup>TG</sup> and K18-hACE2<sup>TG</sup>/Tymp<sup>-/-</sup> mice were treated with a single dose of SP or p3.1 by intraperitoneal injection and then subjected to thrombosis studies three days later. The role of SP on inflammatory signaling activation was assessed in BEAS-2B cells. SARS-CoV-2 SP increased the expression of TYMP, resulting in the activation of STAT3 and NF-κB in BEAS-2B cells. A siRNA-mediated knockdown of TYMP attenuated SP-enhanced activation of STAT3. SP significantly promoted arterial thrombosis in K18-hACE2<sup>TG</sup> mice. SP-accelerated thrombosis was attenuated by inhibition or genetic ablation of TYMP. SP treatment did not influence ADP- or collagen-induced platelet aggregation but significantly increased platelet adhesion to fibrinogen. SP treatment also significantly shortened activated partial thromboplastin time, which was reversed and even prolonged by TYMP deficiency. Additionally, SP binds to platelet factor 4 (PF4) and TYMP. TYMP does not bind PF4 but enhances the formation of the SP/PF4 complex, which may augment the procoagulant and prothrombotic effect of PF4. We conclude that SP is prothrombotic and upregulates TYMP expression, and TYMP inhibition or knockout mitigates SP-enhanced thrombosis. These findings suggest that inhibition of TYMP may be a novel therapeutic strategy for COVID-19-associated thrombosis."

    "abstract": "Introduction Burn injuries pose a significant public health challenge globally, with Appalachia facing unique obstacles due to its rugged terrain, economic disparities, and limited access to healthcare. Understanding mortality risk factors specific to Appalachian burn patients is crucial for optimizing treatment approaches in this underserved population. Materials and methods A retrospective analysis of burn patient data from Cabell Huntington Hospital's burn intensive care unit (BICU) over 13 years was conducted. Patient records were reviewed, and demographic and clinical variables were analyzed using descriptive statistics and logistic regression models. Results Among 1,104 Appalachian burn patients treated at Cabell Huntington Hospital's BICU between January 2010 and June 2023, advanced age, larger total body surface area (TBSA) burned, inhalation injuries, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and third-degree burns were significant predictors of mortality. Advanced age (p < 0.001, OR: 1.07), larger TBSA burned (p < 0.001, OR: 1.1), inhalation injuries (p < 0.001, OR: 8.34), COPD (p < 0.001, OR: 2.64), and third-degree burns (p < 0.001, OR: 6.45) were significant predictors of mortality. Gender, smoking history, diabetes mellitus (DM), and body mass index did not significantly differ between survivors and deceased patients. Discussion/conclusion Our findings underscore the importance of tailored interventions for Appalachian burn patients. Advanced age, pre-existing comorbidities, and burn severity significantly impact mortality risk, emphasizing the need for comprehensive care strategies. Specialized burn centers play a critical role in managing complex burn injuries in underserved regions. Addressing mortality risk factors identified in this study is essential for optimizing burn care outcomes in Appalachia. Tailored interventions and collaborative efforts are needed to improve survival rates and promote health equity for burn patients in underserved regions. Future research should explore additional factors influencing burn outcomes and assess disparities in access to specialized care services."

    "abstract": "With global increase in ageing population along with increasing age-related neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), development of sustainable, safe and effective solutions for promoting healthy ageing and preventing diseases has become a priority. Traditional healthcare systems/medicines prescribe several herbs, foods and formulations to promote healthy ageing and prevent and/or treat age-related diseases. However, the scientific data elucidating their mechanism of action is very limited and deeper research using different models is warranted for timely and wider use. The clinical studies and research with higher model organisms, although useful, have several practical, technical, and financial limitations. Conversely, small organism models like Yeast, Roundworm, Fruit fly, and Zebrafish, which have genetic similarities to humans, can replicate the disease features and provide behavioural, cellular and molecular insights. The common features of ageing and NDs, like amyloid protein aggregations, oxidative stress, energy dysregulation, inflammation and neurodegeneration can be mimicked in the small organism models for Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's diseases, and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. This review focuses on small organism model- based research unveiling interesting modes of action and synergistic effects of herbal extracts, foods, and formulations, which are indicated especially for healthy ageing and management of NDs. This will provide leads for the quick and sustainable development of scientifically evaluated solutions for clinically relevant, age-related conditions."

While many medications are prescribed based on expert knowledge, overviews of actual medication use in HD are sparse. We provide a detailed overview of medication use and associated indications across HD disease stages, considering sex and regional differences. Data from the largest observational HD study, ENROLL-HD, were used. We created HD-related medication and indication classes to identify medication trends in manifest, premanifest and control subjects. We studied medication use in adult, childhood- and adolescent-onset HD, incorporating disease stage (including phenoconverters), sex and regional differences. In 8546 manifest HD patients, 84.6% used medication (any type), with the average number of medications per user rising from 2.5 in premanifest HD to 5.2 in end stage disease. Antipsychotics (29.2%), SSRIs (27.5%) and painkillers (21.8%) were most often used. Medication use varied with disease progression. Several differences were observed between the sexes, and notably between Europe and Northern America as well. Medication use increased after phenoconversion (from 64.8% to 70.6%, P < 0.05), with the largest difference in antipsychotic use (4.4%-7.8%, P < 0.05). Medication patterns were different in childhood-onset HD, with no use of painkillers, less use of anti-chorea and antidepressant drugs, and more for aggression and irritability. Medication use in HD increases with disease progression, with varying types of medications prescribed based on disease stage, sex, and region of living. Recognizing these medication trends is vital for further personalized HD management."

A small retrospective study associated caffeine intake over 190 grams daily to earlier onset of HD symptoms. However, specific data on consumption habits is limited. This study aims to gather pilot data on caffeine use in people with HD, exploring motivations and consequences. Thirty adults with HD completed a survey on daily caffeine intake, its impact on symptoms, and consumption motivations through multiple-choice and open-ended questions. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze findings and compare them to general population data. Caffeine intake ranged from 0 to 1400.4 mg/day, with a median of 273.2 mg/day and a mean of 382.5 mg/day. Seventy percent of participants with HD consumed more caffeine than the average for their age group in the general population. Additionally, 20% of participants and 38% of family members believed caffeine influenced HD symptoms, primarily anxiety. People with HD typically consume more caffeine than the general U.S. population. Contrary to the hypothesis, higher caffeine intake was not associated with significant subjective worsening of HD symptoms. Further research with objective measures and multiple HD centers is necessary to guide screening and counseling on caffeine use in this population. Participants with Huntington's disease (HD) had increased caffeine intake compared to the general population, supporting previous anecdotal observations. Anxiety was the most affected HD symptom. Further research using objective measures of symptom burden and including multiple HD centers can help inform screening and counseling regarding caffeine use in this population."

    "abstract": "The human biological clock is the 24-h internal molecular network of circadian genes in synchronization with other cells in response to external stimuli. The rhythmicity of the clock genes is maintained by positive and negative transcriptional feedback loops coordinating the 24-h oscillation in different tissues. The superchiasmatic nucleus, the central pacemaker of the biological clock diminishes with aging causing alterations in the clock rhythmicity leading to the onset of neurodegenerative diseases mainly Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease. Studies have shown that brain and muscle Arnt -like 1 (Bmal1) and Circadian Locomotor Output Cycles Kaput (Clock) gene expression is altered in the onset of neurodegeneration. One of the major symptoms of neurodegeneration is changes in the sleep/wake cycle. Moreover, variations in circadian clock oscillations can happen due to lifestyle changes, addiction to alcohol, cocaine, drugs, smoking, food habits and most importantly eating and sleep/awake cycle patterns which can significantly impact the expression of circadian genes. Recent studies have focused on the molecular function of clock genes affected due to environmental cues. Epigenetic modifications are influenced by the external environmental factors. This review aims to focus on the principal mechanism of epigenetics influencing circadian rhythm disruption leading to neurodegeneration and as well as targeting the epigenetic modulators could be a novel therapeutic approach to combat neurodegenerative disorders."

    "abstract": "Huntington's disease (HD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease that is manifested by a gradual loss of physical, cognitive, and mental abilities. As the disease advances, age has a major impact on the pathogenic signature of mutant huntingtin (mHTT) protein aggregation. This review aims to explore the intricate relationship between aging, mHTT toxicity, and cellular senescence in HD. Scientific data on the interplay between aging, mHTT, and cellular senescence in HD were collected from several academic databases, including PubMed, Google Scholar, Google, and ScienceDirect. The search terms employed were \"AGING,\" \"HUNTINGTON'S DISEASE,\" \"MUTANT HUNTINGTIN,\" and \"CELLULAR SENESCENCE.\" Additionally, to gather information on the molecular mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets, the search was extended to include relevant terms such as \"DNA DAMAGE,\" \"OXIDATIVE STRESS,\" and \"AUTOPHAGY.\" According to research, aging leads to worsening HD pathophysiology through some processes. As a result of the mHTT accumulation, cellular senescence is promoted, which causes DNA damage, oxidative stress, decreased autophagy, and increased inflammatory responses. Pro-inflammatory cytokines and other substances are released by senescent cells, which may worsen the neuronal damage and the course of the disease. It has been shown that treatments directed at these pathways reduce some of the HD symptoms and enhance longevity in experimental animals, pointing to a new possibility of treating the condition. Through their amplification of the harmful effects of mHTT, aging and cellular senescence play crucial roles in the development of HD. Comprehending these interplays creates novel opportunities for therapeutic measures targeted at alleviating cellular aging and enhancing HD patients' quality of life."

Across 127,205 nuclei from donors with HD and age/sex matched controls, we found heterogeneity of glia which is altered in HD. We describe prominent changes in the abundance of certain subtypes of astrocytes, microglia, oligodendrocyte precursor cells and oligodendrocytes between HD and control samples, and these differences are widespread across brain regions. Furthermore, we highlight possible mechanisms that characterise the glial contribution to HD pathology including depletion of myelinating oligodendrocytes, an oligodendrocyte-specific upregulation of the calmodulin-dependent 3',5'-cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase 1 A (PDE1A) and an upregulation of molecular chaperones as a cross-glial signature and a potential adaptive response to the accumulation of mutant huntingtin (mHTT). Our results support the hypothesis that glia have an important role in the pathology of HD, and show that all types of glia are affected in the disease."

Enhancing the activity of proteolytic pathways may serve as a way of clearing these aggregates in a cell, and consequently, autophagy has surfaced as a promising target for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders. Several strategies involving small molecule compounds that stimulate autophagic pathway of cell have been discovered. However, despite many compounds having demonstrated favorable outcomes in experimental disease models, the translation of these findings into clinical benefits for patient's remains limited. Consequently, alternative strategies are actively being explored to effectively target neurodegeneration via autophagy modulation. Recently, newer approaches such as modulation of expression of autophagic genes have emerged as novel and interesting areas of research in this field, which hold promising potential in neuroprotection. Similarly, as discussed for the first time in this review, the use of autophagy-inducing nanoparticles by utilizing their physicochemical properties to stimulate the autophagic process, rather than relying on their role as drug carriers, offers a completely fresh avenue for targeting neurodegeneration without the risk of drug-associated adverse effects. This review provides fresh perspectives on developing autophagy-targeted therapies for neurodegenerative disorders.

    "abstract": "Phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) is an enzyme primarily found in the smooth muscle of the corpus cavernosum and also highly expressed in the substantia nigra, cerebellum, caudate, hippocampal regions and cerebellar purkinje cells, responsible for selectively breaking down cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) into 5'-GMP and regulate intracellular cGMP levels. As a second messenger, cyclic GMP enhances signals at postsynaptic receptors and triggers downstream effector molecules, leading to changes in gene expression and neuronal responses. Additionally, cGMP signaling transduction cascade, present in the brain, is also essential for learning and memory processes. Mechanistically, PDE5 inhibitors share structural similarities with cGMP, competitively binding to PDE5 and inhibiting cGMP hydrolysis. This action enhances the effects of nitric oxide, resulting in anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects. Neurodegenerative disorders entail the progressive loss of neuron structure, culminating in neuronal cell death, with currently available drugs providing only limited symptomatic relief, rendering neurodegeneration considered incurable. PDE5 inhibitors have recently emerged as a potential therapeutic approach for neurodegeneration, neuroinflammation, and diseases involving cognitive impairment. This review elucidates the principal roles of 3',5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and cGMP signaling pathways in neuronal functions, believed to play pivotal roles in the pathogenesis of various neurodegenerative disorders. It provides an updated assessment of PDE5 inhibitors as disease-modifying agents for conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, cerebral ischemia, Huntington's disease, and neuroinflammation. The paper aims to review the current understanding of PDE5 inhibitors, which concurrently regulate both cAMP and cGMP signaling pathways, positing that they may exert complementary and synergistic effects in modifying neurodegeneration, thus presenting a novel direction in therapeutic discovery. Moreover, the review provides critical about biological functions, therapeutic potentials, limitations, challenges, and emerging applications of selective PDE5 inhibitors.

Our threefold aim was to (A) describe the different combinations of physical and cognitive training used to alleviate the motor and cognitive symptoms of patients with subcortical neurodegenerative disorders, (B) compare the effects of these different combinations (sequential, dual tasking, synergical) on symptoms, and (C) recommend approaches for further studies. We conducted literature searches of PubMed, BASE and ACM, to carry out a systematic review of randomized controlled trials and controlled trials of combined physical and cognitive training among patients with Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Lewy body dementia, spinocerebellar ataxia, Friedreich's ataxia, and progressive supranuclear palsy. Physical, neuropsychological, behavioral outcomes were considered. The Cochrane risk-of-bias tool was used to verify the critical appraisal. Twenty-one studies focused on Parkinson's disease with 940 participants were included. Despites promising benefits on cognitive and physical function, our results revealed discrepant findings for research on combined training. Inconsistencies were linked to the choice of tests, the functions that were targeted, disease progression, and trainings. There was a dearth of follow-up data. Differences between combined training are unclear, particularly regarding the role of cognitive load. Future studies should focus on comparing the feasibility, tolerability, and effectiveness of different combinations of motor-cognitive training."

    "title": "The role of sirtuin 1 in ageing and neurodegenerative disease: A molecular perspective.",
    "abstract": "Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), an NAD+-dependent deacetylase, has emerged as a key regulator of cellular processes linked to ageing and neurodegeneration. SIRT1 modulates various signalling pathways, including those involved in autophagy, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial function, which are critical in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. This review explores the therapeutic potential of SIRT1 in several neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). Preclinical studies have demonstrated that SIRT1 activators, such as resveratrol, SRT1720, and SRT2104, can alleviate disease symptoms by reducing oxidative stress, enhancing autophagic flux, and promoting neuronal survival. Ongoing clinical trials are evaluating the efficacy of these SIRT1 activators, providing hope for future therapeutic strategies targeting SIRT1 in neurodegenerative diseases. This review explores the role of SIRT1 in ageing and neurodegenerative diseases, with a particular focus on its molecular mechanisms, therapeutic potential, and clinical applications."

    "title": "A charge reversal approach for the sensitive quantification of dicarboxylic acids using Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.",
    "abstract": "Dicarboxylic acids (DCAs) are essential for intermediate metabolism and are implicated in multiple processes associated with various diseases. Several DCAs contribute to energy metabolism, impact mitochondrial function, and play a crucial role in body function. However, the low abundance of some DCAs in various body fluids makes their quantification particularly challenging. Therefore, an extremely sensitive method is required to determine DCA level fluctuations in biological samples in different diseases. We developed and optimized an LC-MS/MS method to quantify DCAs. We achieved charge reversal of the compounds from negative to positive ionization through chemical derivatization with dimethylaminophenacyl bromide (DmPABr) targeting the carboxyl group (R-COOH) under mild basic conditions. Derivatization enhanced sensitivity, mass fragmentation, and chromatographic separation for LC-tandem mass spectrometric quantification. The method was analytically optimized and demonstrated excellent linearity for individual DCAs (R<sup>2</sup>>0.99), as well as an exceptionally lower limit of detection (LLOD<266 fg) and lower limit of quantification (LLOQ<805 fg) for all DCAs. Furthermore, most derivatized DCAs were stable at room temperature and after ten repeated freeze-thaw cycles. After DCA extraction and quantification detection, we found differences in their distribution in plasma and urine. The rank order for DCAs in plasma is C4>C6>C7>C9>C5>C8>C22, whereas in the urine sample, the order is C4>C7>C6>C9>C5>C8>C10. For longer chains (C > 16), their proportions were >10x higher in plasma than in urine. Our optimized method using LC-MS/MS enables the quantification of DCAs with excellent sensitivity. The method will help in future studies investigating dicarboxylic acids' crucial role in health and biomarker discovery studies using targeted metabolomics."

Once thought to be a mere consequence of the disease process, increasing evidence points toward a causal or contributory role of the circadian clock in neurodegenerative disease. Circadian clocks control many aspects of cellular biochemistry, including stress pathways implicated in neuronal survival and death. Given the dearth of disease-modifying therapies for these increasingly prevalent disorders, this understanding may lead to breakthroughs in the development of new treatments. In this review, we provide a background on circadian clocks and focus on some potential mechanisms that may be pivotal in neurodegeneration."

    "abstract": "Huntington's disease (HD) is marked by irreversible loss of neuronal function for which currently no availability for disease-modifying treatment exists. Advances in the understanding of disease progression can aid biomarker development, which in turn can accelerate therapeutic discovery. We characterised the progression of altered dynamics of whole-brain network states in the zQ175DN mouse model of HD using a dynamic functional connectivity (FC) approach to resting-state fMRI and identified quasi-periodic patterns (QPPs) of brain activity constituting the most prominent resting-state networks. The occurrence of the normative QPPs, as observed in healthy controls, was reduced in the HD model as the phenotype progressed. This uncovered progressive cessation of synchronous brain activity with phenotypic progression, which is not observed with the conventional static FC approaches. To better understand the potential underlying cause of the observed changes in these brain states, we further assessed how mutant huntingtin (mHTT) protein deposition affects astrocytes and pericytes - one of the most important effectors of neurovascular coupling, along phenotypic progression. Increased cell-type dependent mHTT deposition was observed at the age of onset of motor anomalies, in the caudate putamen, somatosensory and motor cortex, regions that are prominently involved in HD pathology as seen in humans. Our findings provide meaningful insights into the development and progression of altered functional brain dynamics in this HD model and open new avenues in assessing the dynamics of whole brain states, through QPPs, in clinical HD research. Hyperactivity in the LCN-linked regions within short QPPs observed before motor impairment onset. DMLN QPP presents a progressive decrease in DMLN activity and occurrence along HD-like phenotype development. Breakdown of the LCN DMLN state flux at motor onset leads to a subsequent absence of the LCN DMLN QPP at an advanced HD-like stage."

    "abstract": "Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disease that causes cognitive, movement, behavioral, and sleep disturbances, which over time result in progressive disability and eventually death. Clinical translation of novel therapeutics and imaging probes could be accelerated by additional testing in well-characterized large animal models of HD. The major goal of our preliminary cross-sectional study is to demonstrate the feasibility and utility of the unique transgenic sheep model of HD (OVT73) in positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. PET imaging studies were performed in healthy merino sheep (6 year old, <i>n</i> = 3) and OVT73 HD sheep (5.5 year old, <i>n</i> = 3, and 11 year old, <i>n</i> = 3). Region-of-interest and brain atlas labels were defined for regional analyses by using a sheep brain template. [<sup>18</sup>F]fluorodeoxyglucose ([<sup>18</sup>F]FDG) was employed to compare the regional brain glucose metabolism and variations in FDG uptake between control and HD sheep. We also used [<sup>18</sup>F]fluoro-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine ([<sup>18</sup>F]FDOPA) to compare the extent of striatal dysfunction and evaluated the binding potential (BP<sub>ND</sub>) in key brain regions between the groups. Compared with healthy controls and 11 year old HD sheep, the 5.5 year old HD sheep exhibited significantly increased [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG uptake in several cortical and subcortical brain regions (<i>P</i> < 0.05-0.01). No difference in [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG uptake was observed between healthy controls and 11 year old HD sheep. Analysis of the [<sup>18</sup>F]FDOPA BP<sub>ND</sub> parametric maps revealed clusters of reduced binding potential in the 5.5 year old and 11 year old HD sheep compared to the 6 year old control sheep. In this first-of-its-kind study, we showed the usefulness and validity of HD sheep model in imaging cerebral glucose metabolism and dopamine uptake using PET imaging. The identification of discrete patterns of metabolic abnormality using [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG and decline of [<sup>18</sup>F]FDOPA uptake may provide a useful means of quantifying early HD-related changes in these models, particularly in the transition from presymptomatic to early symptomatic phases of HD."

    "abstract": "Emerging evidence suggests that autobiographical memory (ABM) is altered in Huntington's disease (HD). While these impairments are typically attributed to frontostriatal dysfunction, the neural substrates of ABM impairment in HD remain unexplored. To this end, we assessed ABM in 30 participants with genetically confirmed HD (18 premanifest, 12 manifest) and 24 age-matched healthy controls. Participants completed the Autobiographical Interview to assess free and probed ABM recall and underwent structural brain imaging. Whole-brain voxel-based morphometry (VBM) was used to explore voxel-wise associations between ABM performance and grey matter intensity (False Discovery Rate corrected at q = 0.05). Relative to controls, HD participants displayed significantly less detailed ABM retrieval across free and probed recall conditions, irrespective of disease stage. Recall performance did not differ significantly between manifest and premanifest HD groups. VBM analyses indicated that poorer ABM performance was associated with atrophy of a distributed cortico-subcortical network. Key regions implicated irrespective of ABM condition included the bilateral occipital cortex, left precuneus, right parahippocampal gyrus and right caudate nucleus. In addition, probed ABM recall was associated with the superior and inferior frontal gyri, frontal pole, right hippocampus, nucleus accumbens, paracingulate gyrus and cerebellum. Overall, our findings indicate that ABM impairments in HD reflect the progressive degeneration of a distributed cortico-subcortical brain network comprising medial temporal, frontal, striatal and posterior parietal cortices. Our findings advance our understanding of the neurocognitive profile of HD, providing an important foundation for future interventions to support memory function in this population."

    "abstract": "KRAS mutations occur in ~40-50% of mCRC and are associated with aggressive disease that is refractory to anti-EGFR therapies. Pancreatic cancer harbors ~90% KRAS driver gene mutation frequency. Small molecules targeting KRAS G12C gained FDA approval for KRAS G12C-mutated NSCLC. ONC212, a fluorinated imipridone with nM anti-cancer activity has preclinical efficacy against pancreatic cancer and other malignancies. MRTX1133, identified as a noncovalent selective KRAS G12D inhibitor that suppresses G12D signaling by binding to the switch II pocket thereby inhibiting protein-protein interactions. We investigated cell viability, drug synergies, pERK suppression and cytokine, chemokine or growth factor alterations following treatment with 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) or ONC212 plus MRTX1133 in 6 human CRC and 4 human pancreatic cancer cell lines. IC50 sensitivities ranged from 7 to 12 µM for 5-FU, 0.2-0.8 µM for ONC212, and > 100 nM to > 5,000 nM for MRTX1133 (G12D N = 4: LS513 > 100, HPAF-II > 1,000, SNUC2B > 5,000, PANC-1 > 5,000). For non-G12D, the range of IC50 for MRTX1133 was > 1,000 to > 5,000 nM for CRC lines with G12V, G13D, or WT KRAS (N = 7). Synergies between MRTX1133 plus 5-FU or ONC212 were observed regardless of KRAS G12D mutation with combination indices of < 0.5 indicating strong synergy. Observed synergies were greater with MRTX1133 plus ONC212 compared to MRTX1133 plus 5-FU. pERK was suppressed with mutant but not wild-type KRAS at nM MRTX1133 doses. Immunostimulatory profiles included reduction in IL8/CXCL8, MICA, Angiopoietin 2, VEGF and TNF-alpha and increase in IL-18/IL-1F4 with MRTX treatments and combinations. Our studies reveal preclinical activity of MRTX1133 alone or synergies when combined with 5-FU or ONC212 against mCRC and pancreatic cancer cells regardless of KRAS G12D mutation. The results suggest that KRAS G12V and KRAS G13D should be further considered in clinical trials including combination therapies involving MRTX1133 and 5-FU or ONC212."

For example, a genetic variant in FAN1, Arg507 to His hastens onset of Huntington's disease, a repeat expansion disorder for which there is no cure. How the Arg507His mutation affects FAN1 structure and enzymatic function is unknown. Using cryo-EM and biochemistry, we have discovered that FAN1 arginine 507 is critical for its interaction with PCNA, and mutation of Arg507 to His attenuates assembly of the FAN1-PCNA on a disease-relevant extrahelical DNA extrusions formed within DNA repeats. This mutation concomitantly abolishes PCNA-FAN1-dependent cleavage of such extrusions, underscoring the importance of PCNA to the genome stabilizing function of FAN1. These results unravel the molecular basis for a specific mutation in FAN1 that dramatically hastens the onset of Huntington's disease."

Motor, psychological, and cognitive symptoms characterize HD, a neurodegenerative disease. One prominent movement disorder associated with HD is chorea, which results in uncontrollably jerky movements of the muscles. HD has no known cure; instead, symptom management with a variety of medication options is the main goal. Effective management is essential because chorea has a significant impact on patients' quality of life. Dutetrabenazine is the first deuterated medication to receive approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the therapeutic treatment of chorea in Huntington's disease (HD). Treating chorea associated with HD may benefit from the use of deutetrabenazine. The novel compound deutetrabenazine contains deuterium. It inhibits CYP2D6 metabolism, prolongs the half-lives of active metabolites, and may cause persistent systemic exposure while maintaining significant pharmacological action. Deutetrabenazine decreases the release of monoamines, including dopamine, in the synaptic cleft by inhibiting the VMAT2 vesicular monoamine transporter. For chorea, this mechanism has a therapeutic effect. For the treatment of choreiform movement and tardive dyskinesia in HD, the FDA approved deutetrabenazine in 2017. Here we highlight, Deutetrabenazine as a promising new treatment for Huntington's disease chorea, for patients with chorea, deutetrabenazine offers hope for an enhanced quality of life. To completely understand its effectiveness and potential advantages, additional research is necessary, including direct comparison studies, as a result of the mixed study results."

However, its limited water solubility restricts its bioavailability and therapeutic applications. To address this issue and bolster the neuroprotective properties of CHR for potential nutraceutical or medicinal use, we investigated a novel compound, LQFM280, formed by conjugating CHR with β-d-glucose tetraacetate. We conducted both in vitro (using SH-SY5Y cells, mutant STHdhQ111/Q111 cells, and wild-type STHdhQ7/Q7 cells), and in vivo (mice) neurotoxicity experimental model induced by 3-nitropropionic acid, which mimic biological changes akin to Huntington's disease in humans. Compared to non-glycosylated CHR, LQFM280 showed superior in vitro effects in preventing neurotoxicity caused by increased mitochondrial vulnerability due to mutant huntingtin. In vivo findings demonstrated that LQFM280 has heightened efficacy in mitigating weight loss, memory and locomotor impairment, oxidative stress, and disruptions in the antioxidant defense system, as well as succinate dehydrogenase, and cholinesterase activities induced by 3-nitropropionic acid. These findings underscore the significant enhancement of chrysin's neuroprotective effects through glycosylation with β-d-glucose tetraacetate, positioning it as a promising candidate for use as a nutraceutical or food supplement to promote health benefits."

    "abstract": "Clearing of toxic polyglutamine aggregates from neuronal cells is crucial for ameliorating Huntington's disease. However, such clearance is challenging, requiring the targeting of affected neuron cells in the brain, followed by the removal of polyglutamine from cells. Here we report a designed nanodrug that can be used for the ultrasound-based removal of toxic polyglutamine aggregates from neuron cells. The nanodrug is composed of a sonosensitizer molecule, chlorin e6- or protoporphyrin IX-loaded polymer micelle of 20-30 nm in size that rapidly delivers the sonosensitizer into the cell nucleus. Ultrasound exposure of these cells generates singlet oxygen in the nucleus/perinuclear region that induces strong autophagic flux and clears toxic polyglutamine aggregates from cells. It has been demonstrated that the nanodrug and ultrasound treatment can enhance the cell survival against polyglutamine aggregates by 4 times. This result suggests that the nanodrug can be designed for focused ultrasound-based wireless treatment of various neurodegenerative diseases."

PolyQ pathology involves multiple cellular events and phytochemicals with multi-target mechanisms hold promise to treat these diseases with least side effects.

The present study investigated the effects of Eugenol on neurodegeneration and motor dysfunction in transgenic <i>Drosophila</i> models of PolyQ diseases. In this study, the robust pseudopupil assay was performed to analyze adult photoreceptor neuron degeneration, a marker of widespread degenerative events. Furthermore, the well-established crawling and climbing assays were conducted to evaluate progressive motor dysfunction in the PolyQ larvae and flies. This study found that Eugenol administration at disease onset or after progression reduced PolyQ disease phenotypes, particularly, neurodegeneration and motor dysfunction in a dose-dependent manner and with no side effects. Thus, this study suggests that Eugenol could be a viable candidate for developing treatments for PolyQ diseases, offering a multi-target approach with the potential for minimal or no side effects compared to conventional therapies."

Many neurodegeneration-associated proteins are autophagy substrates, and autophagy upregulation ameliorates disease in many animal models of neurodegeneration by enhancing the clearance of toxic proteins, proinflammatory molecules, and dysfunctional organelles. Autophagy inhibition also induces neuronal and glial senescence, a phenomenon that occurs with increasing age in non-diseased brains as well as in response to neurodegeneration-associated stresses. However, aging and many neurodegeneration-associated proteins and mutations impair autophagy. This creates a potentially detrimental feedback loop whereby the accumulation of these disease-associated proteins impairs their autophagic clearance, facilitating their further accumulation and aggregation. Thus, understanding how autophagy interacts with aging, senescence, and neurodegenerative diseases in a temporal, cellular, and genetic context is important for the future clinical application of autophagy-modulating therapies in aging and neurodegeneration."

HDAC4 is an established target for various indication areas, in particular Huntington's disease, heart failure and cancer. To reduce unwanted side effects, it is advantageous to develop isozyme-selective inhibitors, which poses a major challenge due to the highly conserved active centers of the HDAC family. According to current knowledge it is assumed that H976 in HDAC4<sub>wt</sub> occurs exclusively in the out-conformation and thus the selective foot pocket is constitutively open. In contrast, the side chain of the corresponding tyrosine in HDAC4<sub>H976Y</sub> adopts the in-conformation, and is thus able to stabilize the intermediate state of the deacetylation reaction and block access to the foot pocket. In this study, we provide evidence that a dynamic equilibrium exists between the in- and out-conformation in HDAC4<sub>wt</sub>. The binding of selective HDAC4 inhibitors that address the foot pocket can be enhanced in HDAC4 variants with mainly small, but also medium hydrophobic or polar side chains. We attribute this to the fact that these side chains are preferentially present in the out-conformation. Therefore, we propose HDAC4<sub>H976A</sub> and other HDAC4 variants as promising tools to find and enrich HDAC4-selective foot pocket binders in screening campaigns that might have been overlooked in conventional screens with HDAC4<sub>wt</sub>."

The objective was to identify and quantify costs of HD by stage of disease progression. A systematic search of Medline, Embase, Scopus, and Cochrane Library was used to identify types of costs that are frequently reported for individuals diagnosed with HD and to quantify those costs across early, middle, and late stages of HD. Full-text, original research articles were included if they reported costs specific to HD burden. To standardize stage-level costs, Shoulson Fahn and Barthel Index scores were combined to estimate the cost for early, middle-, and late-stage HD. A total of 692 abstracts were identifie,d and following abstract screening, a total of 80 full-text articles were reviewed for inclusion. Only five studies were included for extraction and synthesis including three from the USA, one from the United Kingdom (UK), and one from Peru. Annual inpatient, outpatient, drug costs, and caregiving costs all increased substantially as disease progressed. Outpatient costs were approximately 2.5 times greater than inpatient costs for early and middle stages of HD. Among all the costs associated with HD, annual caregiver cost emerges as the most significant costs in the economic burden of HD, ranging from a minimum of $6041 for early stage to a maximum of $133,200 for late-stage HD. Significant variation was observed across studies, especially comparing costs observed in Peru with the USA and UK. Outpatient costs exceed inpatient costs, especially in early and middle stages, underscoring the importance of outpatient care. All costs seem to rise rapidly, in a nonlinear fashion, as patients advance to later stages. While only two studies reported caregiver burden, these costs were significanly higher in the most severe stage, where patients were completely dependent on a caregiver. This review highlights the complexity of cost assessment in HD and underscores the need for consistent methods and further research to guide effective policy actions."

Retrospective cohort of deceased individuals with HD from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Health Statistics. A total of 13,350 individuals with HD who died in the United States between 2009 and 2019. We analyzed place of death, categorized as long-term care (LTC) facility, home, hospital, hospice facility, and other locations. Trends in the places of death from 2009 to 2019 were assessed using linear regression models. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to identify sociodemographic factors associated with place of death. From 2009 to 2019, the greatest proportion of deaths occurred in LTC facilities (48.4%). There was a significantly decreasing trend in the proportion of deaths occurring in LTC facilities (53.5%-43.9%, P < .001). A greater proportion of deaths in rural areas occurred in LTC facilities compared with all other locations (P < .001 for all comparisons). In the multivariate model, aged younger than 44 years, Black race, Hispanic ethnicity, some college education or greater, and being married were associated with significantly lower odds of dying in a LTC facility compared with home. Despite a decreasing trend, LTC facilities remain a cornerstone of support for individuals with HD, particularly in rural areas. These results suggest multiple avenues for research to improve accessibility and quality of care for individuals with late stages of HD. Future studies are needed to further understand the impact of rurality and lack of support in the home on the accessibility and quality of LTC and hospice care for individuals with HD. These results may also help inform interventions focused on training and staff education within LTC and hospice facilities to better manage HD progression and symptoms."

In this cross-sectional study, we conducted a descriptive statistical analysis of the 2017-2020 prescription records for deutetrabenazine and valbenazine using the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Medicare Provider Utilization and Payment Data: Part D Prescriber public use file. In addition, we linked this data set to the Open Payment database to analyze industry payments. We identified a total of 3,706 deutetrabenazine prescribers and 4,895 valbenazine prescribers. Prescription volume (standardized 30-day prescription) increased annually across different specialties for both VMAT-2 inhibitors from 2017 to 2020. Neurologists were the highest contributors to deutetrabenazine prescriptions (N = 50,017; 35.2%), and psychiatrists were the highest contributors to valbenazine prescriptions (N = 77,799; 42.3%). A total of 1,217 deutetrabenazine physician prescribers (47.5%) and 1,509 valbenazine physician prescribers (49.7%) received industry payments from TEVA Pharmaceuticals and Neurocrine Biosciences, respectively. Receipt of industry payments was associated with higher prescription volume for both deutetrabenazine (<i>p</i> < 0.001) and valbenazine (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Approximately three-quarters of the industry payments were used in nonconsulting services, with a median payment value per physician of $18,101 for deutetrabenazine and $25,920 for valbenazine. The findings illustrate a yearly increase in Medicare prescription volume for deutetrabenazine and valbenazine after FDA approval, with neurologists and psychiatrists as primary prescribers of deutetrabenazine and valbenazine, respectively. There was a statistical difference in the prescription volume between those who received industry payments and those who did not, suggesting that receipt of payments may be associated with prescription volume. Nonconsulting services constituted the largest sum of industry payments for both medications. Further research exploring the causative factors of new medication uptake is needed to better understand how medications disseminate across the market."

    "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and Huntington's disease (HD) are complex neurological conditions with unclear causes and limited treatments, affecting individuals, families, and society. Despite ASD and HD representing two opposing stages of neuronal development and degeneration, they share similar clinical-pathological features in motor function. In this study, we leveraged transcriptomic data from the prefrontal cortex available in public databases to identify shared transcriptional characteristics of ASD and HD. Differential expression analysis revealed that the majority of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were up-regulated in ASD carriers, whereas most DEGs were down-regulated in HD carriers. Among the DEGs shared between both diseases, three out of seven protein-coding genes were related to the immune system. Furthermore, we identified two enriched pathways shared between ASD and HD DEGs. The gene interaction network analysis unveiled four hub genes shared by both diseases, all of which are associated with immune functions. The findings suggest a shared gene expression pattern in the prefrontal cortex of people with ASD and HD, closely linked to the immune system. These findings will contribute to exploring the biological mechanisms underlying the shared phenotypes of these two diseases from an immunological perspective."

    "abstract": "Since randomized clinical trials currently do not support continuous positive airway pressure treatment of asymptomatic obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) we proposed the Obesity, Symptoms, and CARdiovascular assessment (OSCAR) algorithm to aid clinicians in the management of asymptomatic low-risk moderate-severe OSA, focusing on weight loss, symptoms and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk assessment. Exploiting the data of the Sleep Heart Health Study we selected subjects with a body mass index (BMI) < 30 Kg/m<sup>2</sup>, no history of CVD or sleepiness and compared 552 patients with moderate-severe OSA (OSCAR(-)) to 916 individuals without OSA (No-OSA). After adjusting for age, gender, and BMI, there was no significant difference in the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) between OSCAR(-) and No-OSA (1.05; 95%CI 0.81-1.37). The study suggests that low-risk moderate-severe OSA patients may not have a greater risk of MACE compared to those without OSA and highlights the need for further research on this topic."

    "abstract": "<b>Objective:</b> Visuospatial deficits have been extensively studied in Huntington's disease (HD), particularly in relation to visuomotor integration, with less emphasis on visuo-constructive abilities. Quantitative analyses have demonstrated that individuals with HD perform worse than healthy controls (HC) but similarly to people with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The aim of the present study was to conduct a qualitative investigation of visuo-constructive abilities in both HD and AD. By employing both simple and complex tasks, we hypothesized that a qualitative analysis of performance would reveal a distinct pattern of errors specific to HD. <b>Methods:</b> Participants for this study were identified retrospectively. The sample included 41 individuals with HD, 25 with AD, and 35 HC. All participants underwent a neuropsychological battery, which included the Constructional Apraxia Test (CAT) and the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure (ROCF) test. <b>Results:</b> Our results showed no significant quantitative difference in visuo-constructive performance between the two patient groups. However, distinct qualitative patterns of drawing errors emerged. Simplifications were more frequent in the AD group, while distortions were distinctive errors in the HD group. These qualitative error patterns were consistent across both the CAT and ROCF. <b>Conclusion:</b> Our study emphasises the value of qualitative analysis in interpreting visuo-constructive performance, shifting the focus from \"how much\" a participant achieves to \"how\" they perform a neuropsychological task. This qualitative approach is useful to capture the complexity and variability of individual performance, providing deeper insight into the cognitive processes affected by different neurological conditions."

The mechanisms behind HTT1a production are not fully understood. Considering the role of m<sup>6</sup>A in RNA processing and splicing, we investigated its involvement in HTT1a generation. Here, we show that m<sup>6</sup>A methylation is increased before the cryptic poly(A) sites (IpA1 and IpA2) within the huntingtin RNA in the striatum of Hdh+/Q111 mice and human HD samples. We further assessed m<sup>6</sup>A's role in mutant Htt mRNA processing by pharmacological inhibition and knockdown of METTL3, as well as targeted demethylation of Htt intron 1 using a dCas13-ALKBH5 system in HD mouse cells. Our data reveal that Htt1a transcript levels are regulated by both METTL3 and the methylation status of Htt intron 1. They also show that m<sup>6</sup>A methylation in intron 1 depends on expanded CAG repeats. Our findings highlight a potential role for m<sup>6</sup>A in aberrant splicing of Htt mRNA."

    "abstract": "Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder affecting individuals worldwide. It is characterized by progressive motor dysfunction, cognitive decline, and psychiatric disturbances. The pathogenesis of HD involves oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), a key transcription factor regulating cellular responses to redox imbalance and inflammation, has emerged as a potential target for therapeutic intervention. Through the use of a number of different search engines like Scopus, PubMed, Elsevier and Bentham, a literature review was carried out with the keywords 'Huntington's Disease, 'Pathology of HD' and 'Nrf2 signalling pathway'. Using the keywords that were given above, this review was carried out in order to collect the most recent publications and gain an understanding of the breadth of the extensive research that has been conducted on the role of Nrf2 in HD pathogenesis. Oxidative stress and neuroinflammation significantly contribute to HD progression. Activation of Nrf2 offers neuroprotection by enhancing anti-oxidant defense mechanisms. Furthermore, several signaling pathways, play crucial roles in HD pathophysiology. Pharmacological modulation of these pathways through selective inhibitors or agonists shows promise for the development of new therapeutic strategies. The various downstream pathways such as extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK), phosphoinositide 3-Kinase (PI3-K), 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), Sirtuins, Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) plays a role in alleviating pathophysiology of HD. Diverse reports of these studies demonstrated PI3-K/AMPK/ERK/Sirtuins activators and MAPK inhibitors as encouraging targets in alleviating HD pathophysiology."

    "abstract": "Huntington's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expanded CAG repeat mutation in the Huntingtin (HTT) gene. The mutation impacts neuronal protein homeostasis and cortical/striatal circuitry. SUMOylation is a post-translational modification with broad cellular effects including via modification of synaptic proteins. Here, we used an optimized SUMO protein-enrichment and mass spectrometry method to identify the protein SUMOylation/SUMO interaction proteome in the context of Huntington's disease using R6/2 transgenic and non-transgenic mice. Significant changes in the enrichment of SUMOylated and SUMO-interacting proteins were observed, including those involved in presynaptic function, cytomatrix at the active zone, cytoskeleton organization and glutamatergic signalling. Mitochondrial and RNA-binding proteins also showed altered enrichment. Modified SUMO-associated pathways in Huntington's disease tissue include clathrin-mediated endocytosis signalling, synaptogenesis signalling, synaptic long-term potentiation and SNARE signalling. To evaluate how modulation of SUMOylation might influence functional measures of neuronal activity in Huntington's disease cells in vitro, we used primary neuronal cultures from R6/2 and non-transgenic mice. A receptor internalization assay for the metabotropic glutamate receptor 7 (mGLUR7), a SUMO-enriched protein in the mass spectrometry, showed decreased internalization in R6/2 neurons compared to non-transgenic neurons. SiRNA-mediated knockdown of the E3 SUMO ligase protein inhibitor of activated STAT1 (Pias1), which can SUMO modify mGLUR7, reduced this Huntington's disease phenotype. In addition, microelectrode array analysis of primary neuronal cultures indicated early hyperactivity in Huntington's disease cells, while later time points demonstrated deficits in several measurements of neuronal activity within cortical neurons. Huntington's disease phenotypes were rescued at selected time points following knockdown of Pias1. Collectively, our results provide a mouse brain SUMOome resource and show that significant alterations occur within the post-translational landscape of SUMO-protein interactions of synaptic proteins in Huntington's disease mice, suggesting that targeting of synaptic SUMO networks may provide a proteostatic systems-based therapeutic approach for Huntington's disease and other neurological disorders."

    "abstract": "The alterations in the basal ganglia circuitry are core pathological hallmark in Huntington's Disease (HD) and traditionally linked to its sever motor symptoms. Recently it was shown that optogenetic stimulation of cortical afferences to the striatum is able to reverse motor symptoms in HD mice. However, the specific contribution of the direct and indirect striatal output pathways from the dorsolateral (DLS) and dorsomedial striatum (DMS) to the motor phenotype is still not clear. Here, we aim to uncover the contributions of these striatal subcircuits to motor control in wild type (WT) and HD mice by using the symptomatic R6/1 mice. We systematically evaluated locomotion, exploratory behavior, and motor learning effects of the selective optogenetic stimulation of D1 or A2A expressing neurons (direct and indirect pathway, respectively), in DLS or DMS. Bilateral optogenetic stimulation of the direct pathway from DLS and the indirect pathway from DMS resulted in subtle locomotor enhancements, while unaltering exploratory behavior. Additionally, bilateral stimulation of the indirect pathway from the DLS improved performance in the accelerated rotarod task, suggesting a role in motor learning. In contrast, in HD mice, stimulation of these pathways did not modulate any of these behaviors. Overall, this study highlights that selective stimulation of direct and indirect pathways from DLS and DMS have subtle impact in locomotion, exploratory activity or motor learning. The lack of responses in HD mice also suggests that strategies involving cortico-striatal circuits rather than striatal output circuits might be a better strategy for managing motor symptoms in movement disorders."

    "abstract": "There is now compelling evidence for the presence of pathological forms of Tau in tissues of both patients and animal models of Huntington's disease (HD). While the root cause of this illness is a mutation within the huntingtin gene, a number of studies now suggest that HD could also be considered a secondary tauopathy. However, the contributory role of Tau in the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of this condition, as well as its implications in cellular toxicity and consequent behavioral impairments are largely unknown. We therefore performed intracerebral stereotaxic injections of recombinant human Tau monomers and fibrils into the knock-in zQ175 mouse model of HD. Tau fibrils induced cognitive and anxiety-like phenotypes predominantly in zQ175 mice and increased the number and size of insoluble mutant huntingtin (mHTT) aggregates in the brains of treated animals. To better understand the putative mechanisms through which Tau could initiate and/or contribute to pathology, we incubated StHdh striatal cells, an in vitro model of HD, with the different Tau forms and evaluated the effects on cell functionality and heat shock proteins Hsp70 and Hsp90. Calcium imaging experiments showed functional impairments of HD StHdh cells following treatment with Tau fibrils, as well as significant changes to the levels of both heat shock proteins which were found trapped within mHTT aggregates. The accumulation of Hsp70 and 90 within aggregates was also present in mouse tissue which suggests that alteration of molecular chaperone-dependent protein quality control may influence aggregation, implicating proteostasis in the mHTT-Tau interplay."

    "abstract": "Huntington disease (HD) is a progressive and devastating neurodegenerative disease caused by expansion of a glutamine-coding CAG tract in the huntingtin (<i>HTT</i>) gene above a critical threshold of ~35 repeats resulting in expression of mutant HTT (mHTT). A promising treatment approach being tested in clinical trials is HTT lowering, which aims to reduce levels of the mHTT protein. Target engagement of these therapies in the brain are inferred using antibody-based assays to measure mHTT levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which is frequently reported as absolute mHTT concentration based on a monomeric protein standard used to generate a standard curve. However, patient biofluids are a complex milieu of different mHTT protein species, suggesting that absolute quantitation is challenging, and a single, recombinant protein standard may not be sufficient to interpret assay signal as molar mHTT concentration. In this study, we used immunoprecipitation and flow cytometry (IP-FCM) to investigate different factors that influence mHTT detection assay signal. Our results show that HTT protein fragmentation, protein-protein interactions, affinity tag positioning, oligomerization and polyglutamine tract length affect assay signal intensity, indicating that absolute HTT quantitation in heterogeneous biological samples is not possible with current technologies using a single standard protein. We also explore the binding specificity of the MW1 anti-polyglutamine antibody, commonly used in these assays as a mHTT-selective reagent and demonstrate that mHTT binding is preferred but not specific. Furthermore, we find that MW1 depletion is not only incomplete, leaving residual mHTT, but also non-specific, resulting in pull down of some wildtype HTT protein. Based on these observations, we recommend that mHTT detection assays report only relative mHTT quantitation using normalized arbitrary units of assay signal intensity, rather than molar concentrations, in the assessment of central nervous system HTT lowering in ongoing clinical and preclinical studies, and that MW1-depletion not be used a method for quantifying wildtype HTT protein."

    "abstract": "In Huntington's Disease (HD) and related disorders, expansion of CAG trinucleotide repeats produces a toxic gain of function in affected neurons. Expanded huntingtin (expHTT) mRNA forms aggregates that sequester essential RNA binding proteins, dysregulating mRNA processing and translation. The physical basis of RNA aggregation has been difficult to disentangle owing to the heterogeneous structure of the CAG repeats. Here, we probe the folding and unfolding pathways of expHTT mRNA using single-molecule force spectroscopy. Whereas normal HTT mRNAs unfold reversibly and cooperatively, expHTT mRNAs with 20 or 40 CAG repeats slip and unravel non-cooperatively at low tension. Slippage of CAG base pairs is punctuated by concerted rearrangement of adjacent CCG trinucleotides, trapping partially folded structures that readily base pair with another RNA strand. We suggest that the conformational entropy of the CAG repeats, combined with stable CCG base pairs, creates a stick-slip behavior that explains the aggregation propensity of expHTT mRNA."

    "abstract": "Therapeutic approaches aimed at lowering toxic mutant huntingtin (mHTT) levels in the brain can reverse disease phenotypes in animal models of Huntington's disease (HD) and are currently being evaluated in clinical trials. Sensitive and dynamic response biomarkers are needed to assess the efficacy of such candidate therapies. Neurofilament light chain (NfL) is a biomarker of neurodegeneration that increases in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood with progression of HD. However, it remains unknown whether NfL in biofluids could serve as a response biomarker for assessing the efficacy of disease-modifying therapies for HD. Longitudinal plasma and cross-sectional CSF samples were collected from the YAC128 transgenic mouse model of HD and wild-type (WT) littermate control mice throughout the natural history of disease. Additionally, biofluids were collected from YAC128 mice following intracerebroventricular administration of an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) targeting the mutant HTT transgene (HTT ASO), at ages both before and after the onset of disease phenotypes. NfL concentrations in plasma and CSF were quantified using ultrasensitive single-molecule array technology. Plasma and CSF NfL concentrations were significantly elevated in YAC128 compared to WT littermate control mice from 9 months of age. Treatment of YAC128 mice with either 15 or 50 µg HTT ASO resulted in a dose-dependent, allele-selective reduction of mHTT throughout the brain at a 3-month interval, which was sustained with high-dose HTT ASO treatment for up to 6 months. Lowering of brain mHTT prior to the onset of regional brain atrophy and HD-like motor deficits in this model had minimal effect on plasma NfL at either dose, but led to a dose-dependent reduction of CSF NfL. In contrast, initiating mHTT lowering in the brain after the onset of neuropathological and behavioural phenotypes in YAC128 mice resulted in a dose-dependent stabilization of NfL increases in both plasma and CSF. Our data provide evidence that the response of NfL in biofluids is influenced by the magnitude of mHTT lowering in the brain and the timing of intervention, suggesting that NfL may serve as a promising exploratory response biomarker for HD."

Neuropathological studies have shown that neuronal loss is largely restricted to the cerebellum. Although the repeat locus is highly unstable during intergenerational transmission, it remains unknown whether it exhibits cerebral mosaicism and progressive instability throughout life. We conducted an analysis of the FGF14 GAA•TTC repeat somatic instability across 156 serial blood samples from 69 individuals, fibroblasts, induced pluripotent stem cells and post-mortem brain tissues from six controls and six patients with SCA27B, alongside methylation profiling using targeted long-read sequencing. Peripheral tissues exhibited minimal somatic instability, which did not significantly change over periods of more than 20 years. In post-mortem brains, the GAA•TTC repeat was remarkably stable across all regions, except in the cerebellar hemispheres and vermis. The levels of somatic expansion in the cerebellar hemispheres and vermis were, on average, 3.15 and 2.72 times greater relative to other examined brain regions, respectively. Additionally, levels of somatic expansion in the brain increased with repeat length and tissue expression of FGF14. We found no significant difference in methylation of wild-type and expanded FGF14 alleles in post-mortem cerebellar hemispheres between patients and controls. In conclusion, our study revealed that the FGF14 GAA•TTC repeat exhibits a cerebellar-specific expansion bias, which may explain the pure cerebellar involvement in SCA27B."

    "abstract": "Despite the advances in the understanding of Huntington's disease (HD), there is a need for molecular biomarkers to categorize mutation carriers during the preclinical stage of the disease preceding functional decline. Small RNAs (sRNAs) are a promising source of biomarkers since their expression levels are highly sensitive to pathobiological processes. Here, using an optimized method for plasma extracellular vesicles (EVs) purification and an exhaustive analysis pipeline of sRNA sequencing data, we show that EV-sRNAs are downregulated early in mutation carriers and that this deregulation is associated with premanifest cognitive performance. Seven candidate sRNAs (tRF-Glu-CTC, tRF-Gly-GCC, miR-451a, miR-21-5p, miR-26a-5p, miR-27a-3p and let7a-5p) were validated in additional subjects, showing a significant diagnostic accuracy at premanifest stages. Of these, miR-21-5p was significantly decreased over time in a longitudinal study; and miR-21-5p and miR-26a-5p levels correlated with cognitive changes in the premanifest cohort. In summary, the present results suggest that deregulated plasma EV-sRNAs define an early biosignature in mutation carriers with specific species highlighting the progression and cognitive changes occurring at the premanifest stage."

A crowded cellular environment plays a crucial role in modulating protein aggregation processes <i>in vivo</i> and the pathological aggregation of proteins linked to different neurodegenerative disorders. Here, we review recent studies examining the effects of various crowding agents, such as polysaccharides, polyethylene glycol, and proteins like BSA and lysozyme on the behaviors of aggregation of several amyloidogenic peptides and proteins, including amylin, huntingtin, tau, α-synuclein, prion, and amyloid-β. We also summarize how the aggregation kinetics, thermodynamic stability, and morphology of amyloid fibrils are altered significantly in the presence of crowding agents. In addition, we also discuss the molecular basis underlying the modulation of amyloidogenic aggregation, focusing on changes in the protein conformation, and the nucleation mechanism. The molecular understanding of the effects of macromolecular crowding on amyloid aggregation is essential for revealing disease pathologies and identifying possible therapeutic targets. Thus, this review offers a perspective on the complex interplay between protein aggregation and the crowded cellular environment <i>in vivo</i> and explains the relevance of crowding in the context of neurodegenerative disorders."

This retrospective analysis used MarketScan databases (1 January 2017-31 December 2021) to identify provider types who diagnosed and managed US adult patients with HD. Patients with continuous enrollment 6 months pre- and 12 months post-diagnosis were included. Outcomes evaluated over 12 months post-diagnosis included hospitalizations, outpatient visits, antipsychotic or vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) inhibitor use, and total healthcare costs. Three hundred and forty eligible patients had a mean age at diagnosis of 49 years. 56.5% were female; 71.5% had a Charlson Comorbidity Index of 0.

    "abstract": "Smoking is the leading behavioural risk factor for mortality globally, accounting for more than 175 million deaths and nearly 4·30 billion years of life lost (YLLs) from 1990 to 2021. The pace of decline in smoking prevalence has slowed in recent years for many countries, and although strategies have recently been proposed to achieve tobacco-free generations, none have been implemented to date. Assessing what could happen if current trends in smoking prevalence persist, and what could happen if additional smoking prevalence reductions occur, is important for communicating the effect of potential smoking policies. In this analysis, we use the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation's Future Health Scenarios platform to forecast the effects of three smoking prevalence scenarios on all-cause and cause-specific YLLs and life expectancy at birth until 2050. YLLs were computed for each scenario using the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021 reference life table and forecasts of cause-specific mortality under each scenario. The reference scenario forecasts what could occur if past smoking prevalence and other risk factor trends continue, the Tobacco Smoking Elimination as of 2023 (Elimination-2023) scenario quantifies the maximum potential future health benefits from assuming zero percent smoking prevalence from 2023 onwards, whereas the Tobacco Smoking Elimination by 2050 (Elimination-2050) scenario provides estimates for countries considering policies to steadily reduce smoking prevalence to 5%. Together, these scenarios underscore the magnitude of health benefits that could be reached by 2050 if countries take decisive action to eliminate smoking. The 95% uncertainty interval (UI) of estimates is based on the 2·5th and 97·5th percentile of draws that were carried through the multistage computational framework. Global age-standardised smoking prevalence was estimated to be 28·5% (95% UI 27·9-29·1) among males and 5·96% (5·76-6·21) among females in 2022. In the reference scenario, smoking prevalence declined by 25·9% (25·2-26·6) among males, and 30·0% (26·1-32·1) among females from 2022 to 2050. Under this scenario, we forecast a cumulative 29·3 billion (95% UI 26·8-32·4) overall YLLs among males and 22·2 billion (20·1-24·6) YLLs among females over this period. Life expectancy at birth under this scenario would increase from 73·6 years (95% UI 72·8-74·4) in 2022 to 78·3 years (75·9-80·3) in 2050. Under our Elimination-2023 scenario, we forecast 2·04 billion (95% UI 1·90-2·21) fewer cumulative YLLs by 2050 compared with the reference scenario, and life expectancy at birth would increase to 77·6 years (95% UI 75·1-79·6) among males and 81·0 years (78·5-83·1) among females. Under our Elimination-2050 scenario, we forecast 735 million (675-808) and 141 million (131-154) cumulative YLLs would be avoided among males and females, respectively. Life expectancy in 2050 would increase to 77·1 years (95% UI 74·6-79·0) among males and 80·8 years (78·3-82·9) among females. Existing tobacco policies must be maintained if smoking prevalence is to continue to decline as forecast by the reference scenario. In addition, substantial smoking-attributable burden can be avoided by accelerating the pace of smoking elimination. Implementation of new tobacco control policies are crucial in avoiding additional smoking-attributable burden in the coming decades and to ensure that the gains won over the past three decades are not lost.

    "abstract": "Pediatric-onset Huntington's disease (POHD) exhibits a phenotype different from adult-onset HD (AOHD), with hypokinetic movement disorders (eg, rigidity, bradykinesia, and dystonia) rather than chorea typical of AOHD. The aim was to identify pathophysiology-based biomarkers specific to POHD (≥60 CAG repeats). Simultaneous hybrid imaging using [<sup>18</sup>F]fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose (FDG) positron emission tomography plus magnetic resonance imaging (FDG-PET/MRI) and clinical assessment using standardized Huntington's disease (HD) scales were employed. Exploratory longitudinal analyses were also performed. Striatal volume loss was remarkable and more severe in POHD (n = 5) than in AOHD (n = 14). Widespread, significantly altered glucose metabolism occurred in several different POHD cortical areas and thalamus, but not AOHD cortex, consistent with differences in clinical progression. POHD patients' brains exhibited distinct morphologic and metabolic traits compared to AOHD patients' brains, with longitudinal changes mirroring clinical progression. Hybrid FDG-PET/MRI highlighted a variable regional brain dysfunction in vivo, as a biological consequence of highly expanded CAG repeats. Findings provide further evidence that POHD is a distinct disease from AOHD."

    "abstract": "Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disease with autosomal dominant inheritance, and no radical cure for HD has been established. Qualitative studies are necessary to investigate the psychological state of individuals who underwent predictive testing for HD, because the psychosocial impact on noncarriers remains unclarified in Japan. Herein, we elucidated the psychosocial impact on the noncarriers for HD and the role of genetic counseling for predictive testing and follow-up after testing by examining their experiences with predictive testing. We conducted semi-structured interviews with eight individuals participating in this study. Interview data were transcribed verbatim and evaluated according to thematic analysis. As a result, 4 themes were generated from 21 categories of 46 codes: (1) Diversity of perceptions concerning the test results, (2) Views on life as a noncarrier, (3) Changes in feelings toward and relationships with family members, and (4) Sharing information within the family. After receiving the negative results, the noncarriers felt not only relief but also surprise, doubt, relief from tension, and regret. It was shown that noncarriers felt survivor's guilt toward many unspecified individuals, which was not only a sense of guilt but also a sense of mission or responsibility. Additionally, they conducted altruistic behavior as members of their family and society, that may be related to the Japanese collectivism. Some participants were concerned about sharing information with their siblings. Noncarriers for HD can experience complex psychological states, and Japanese people who prefer high-context communication may find it difficult to express their feelings and thoughts. It is important to understand their true feelings before and after the predictive genetic testing, reconsider the impact of being a noncarrier and whether it is a burden for them from both subjective and objective perspectives, and conduct long-term follow-up as needed."

    "abstract": "Pancreatic cancer is a highly aggressive cancer with unfavorable prognosis despite the therapeutic interventions. Intraperitoneal chemotherapy has recently shown potential outcomes in the presence of peritoneal metastases. However, a consensus is still lacking on different methods for intraperitoneal chemotherapy in pancreatic cancer. A variety of drugs and doses via three types of intraperitoneal chemotherapy have been studied. The prognosis and treatment strategies for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) will be significantly influenced by peritoneal dissemination and resectability of the macroscopic disease. Normothermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (NIPEC) has been used for the treatment of peritoneal metastases of pancreatic carcinomas. Intraperitoneal chemotherapy is often combined with systemic therapies or surgical procedures which may lead to favorable combination therapies such as cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (CRS/HIPEC). Pressurized intraperitoneal aerosol chemotherapy (PIPAC) is a relatively new approach that provides a homogenous and deep penetration of the chemotherapy into the peritoneum by producing aerosols. The present study aims to review the literature for recent evidence on intraperitoneal chemotherapy in pancreatic cancer."

    "abstract": "Huntington's disease (HD) is a hereditary neurological disorder caused by mutations in HTT, leading to neuronal degeneration. Traditionally, HD is associated with the misfolding and aggregation of mutant huntingtin due to an extended polyglutamine domain encoded by an expanded CAG tract. However, recent research has also highlighted the role of global transcriptional dysregulation in HD pathology. However, understanding the intricate relationship between mRNA expression and HD at the cellular level remains challenging. Our study aimed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of HD pathology using single-cell sequencing data. We used single-cell RNA sequencing analysis to determine differential gene expression patterns between healthy and HD cells. HD cells were effectively modeled using a residual neural network (ResNet), which outperformed traditional and convolutional neural networks. Despite the efficacy of our approach, the F1 score for the test set was 96.53%. Using the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) algorithm, we identified genes influencing HD prediction and revealed their roles in HD pathobiology, such as in the regulation of cellular iron metabolism and mitochondrial function. SHAP analysis also revealed low-abundance genes that were overlooked by traditional differential expression analysis, emphasizing its effectiveness in identifying biologically relevant genes for distinguishing between healthy and HD cells. Overall, the integration of single-cell RNA sequencing data and deep learning models provides valuable insights into HD pathology. We developed the model capable of analyzing HD at single-cell transcriptomic level."

    "abstract": "The existing literature on neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) reveals a common pathological feature: the accumulation of misfolded proteins. However, the heterogeneity in disease onset mechanisms and the specific brain regions affected complicates the understanding of the diverse clinical manifestations of individual NDDs. Dementia, a hallmark symptom across various NDDs, serves as a multifaceted denominator, contributing to the clinical manifestations of these disorders. There is a compelling hypothesis that therapeutic strategies capable of mitigating misfolded protein accumulation and disrupting ongoing pathogenic processes may slow or even halt disease progression. Recent research has linked disease-associated microglia to their transition into a senescent state-characterized by irreversible cell cycle arrest-in aging populations and NDDs. Although senescent microglia are consistently observed in NDDs, few studies have utilized animal models to explore their role in disease pathology. Emerging evidence from experimental rat models suggests that disease-associated microglia exhibit characteristics of senescence, indicating that deeper exploration of microglial senescence could enhance our understanding of NDD pathogenesis and reveal novel therapeutic targets. This review underscores the importance of investigating microglial senescence and its potential contributions to the pathophysiology of NDDs, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Additionally, it highlights the potential of targeting microglial senescence through iron chelation and senolytic therapies as innovative approaches for treating age-related NDDs."

    "abstract": "Microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, regulate the balance of inflammation in the central nervous system under healthy and pathogenic conditions. Huntington's disease (HD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease characterized by activated microglia and elevated concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines within the brain. Chronic hyperactivation of microglia is associated with brain pathology and eventual neuron death. However, it is unclear which specific cytokines are required for neuron death and whether HD neurons may be hypersensitive to neuroinflammation. We assessed the profile of microglia-secreted proteins in response to LPS and IFNγ, and a conditioned media paradigm was used to examine the effects of these secreted proteins on cultured neuronal cells. STHdh<sup>Q7/Q7</sup> and STHdh<sup>Q111/Q111</sup> neuronal cells were used to model wild-type and HD neurons, respectively. We determined that STHdh<sup>Q111/Q111</sup> cells were hypersensitive to pro-inflammatory factors secreted by microglia, and that TNF was required to induce neuronal death. Microglia-mediated neuronal death could be effectively halted through the use of JAK-STAT or TNF inhibitors which supported the requirement for TNF as well as IFNγ in the process of secondary neurotoxicity. Further data derived from human HD patients as well as HD mice were suggestive of enhanced receptor density for TNF (TNFR1) and IFNγ (IFNGR) which could sensitize the HD brain to these cytokines. This highlights several potential mechanisms by which microglia may induce neuronal death and suggests that these mechanisms may be upregulated in the brain of HD patients."

The stress resistance and antiaging potential of AR and BME were assessed in wild-type N2 and transgenic C. elegans strains CF1553, TJ356, and BA17. Transgenic CL4176 expressing the human amyloid-beta peptide (Aβ) was used as a model for Aβ toxicity, whereas transgenic AM141 expressing polyQ aggregates was employed as a model for Huntington's disease. An in silico molecular docking study using Discovery Studio 4.5 was performed to elucidate the putative binding mode of BME to the active sites of Daf-2 protein, involved in longevity and oxidative stress resistance in C. elegans. BME and AR significantly delayed the appearance of oxidative stress markers in wild-type N2 and transgenic strains TJ356 and CF1553, affecting the DAF-16/FOXO transcription factor subcellular distribution and inducing expression of the sod-3 antioxidative gene. Pretreatment with AR significantly reduced the aging marker lipofuscin accumulation in BA17 worms, its effect was greater than that of epigallocatechin gallate, suggesting a potential antiaging effect. Neuroprotective effects of AR and BME were confirmed in AM141 transgenic worms, inducing a significant reduction in the score of polyQ40::GFP aggregates. Moreover, BME (25 µg/mL) resulted in a significant delay in Aβ-induced paralysis in CL4176 worms. In silico molecular modeling revealed that BME exhibited good fitting scores within the active sites of the Daf-2 protein. AR and BME exert beneficial effects in the modulation of age-related markers and attenuation of neurotoxicity in neurodegenerative disorders. Hence, AR and BME could be recognized as promising antioxidant and neuroprotective natural drug candidates that could be included in neuro-nutraceuticals."

To date, however, there has been no longitudinal study exceeding 3 years examining either its serial dynamics or predictive power in HD. We aimed to conduct the first such study. Serum NfL was sampled using ultrasensitive immunoassay at four timepoints across a 14-year period in a cohort of HD gene carriers (n = 21) and controls (n = 14). Gene carriers were premanifest at baseline. Clinical features of HD were evaluated by Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS TMS), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Trail A/B task, Symbol Digit Modalities Task and semantic/phonemic fluency tasks. 14/21 HD gene carriers converted to prodromal or manifest disease by the final timepoint (\"converters\"). At baseline and each subsequent timepoint, NfL levels were higher in converters than in non-converters and controls (p = < 0.001-0.03, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.25-0.66). The estimated rate of change in NfL was higher in converters than in non-converters (p = 0.03) and controls (p = 0.001). Baseline NfL was able to discriminate converters from non-converters (area under curve = 1.000, p = 0.003). A higher rate of change in NfL was predictive of more severe motor (UHDRS-TMS p = 0.007, β = 0.711, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.468) and cognitive deficits (MoCA p = 0.007, β = - 0.798, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.604; Trail B, p = 0.007, β = 0.772, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.567; phonemic fluency p = 0.035, β = - 0.632, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.345). Our data suggest that (1) NfL longitudinal dynamics in premanifest/transitional HD are non-constant; rising faster in those closer to disease onset, and (2) NfL can identify individuals at risk of conversion to manifest disease and predict clinical trajectory, > 10 years from disease onset."

    "abstract": "Canopy Homolog 2 (CNPY2) is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) localized protein belonging to the CNPY gene family. We show here that CNPY2 is protective against ER stress induced by tunicamycin in neuronal cells. Overexpression of CNPY2 enhanced, while downregulation of CNPY2 using shRNA expression, reduced the viability of neuroblastoma cells after tunicamycin. Likewise, recombinant CNPY2 increased survival of cortical neurons in culture after ER stress. CNPY2 reduced the activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) branch of ER stress and decreased the expression of CCAT/Enhancer-Binding Protein Homologous Protein (CHOP) involved in cell death. Immunostaining using mouse brain sections revealed that CNPY2 is expressed by cortical and striatal neurons and is co-expressed with the transcription factor, COUPTF-interacting protein 2 (CTIP2). In transgenic N171-82Q mice, as a model for Huntington's disease (HD), the number of CNPY2-immunopositive neurons was increased in the cortex together with CTIP2. In the striatum, however, the number of CNPY2 decreased at 19 weeks of age, representing a late-stage of pathology. Striatal cells in culture were shown to be more susceptible to ER stress after downregulation of CNPY2. These results demonstrate that CNPY2 is expressed by corticostriatal neurons involved in the regulation of movement. CNPY2 enhances neuronal survival by reducing ER stress and is a promising factor to consider in HD and possibly in other brain diseases."

Together they are common, affecting 1 in 3,000 people worldwide with population-specific differences. However, prevalence estimates of REDs are hampered by heterogeneous clinical presentation, variable geographic distributions and technological limitations leading to underascertainment. Here, leveraging whole-genome sequencing data from 82,176 individuals from different populations, we found an overall disease allele frequency of REDs of 1 in 283 individuals. Modeling disease prevalence using genetic data, age at onset and survival, we show that the expected number of people with REDs would be two to three times higher than currently reported figures, indicating underdiagnosis and/or incomplete penetrance. While some REDs are population specific, for example, Huntington disease-like 2 in Africans, most REDs are represented in all broad genetic ancestries (that is, Europeans, Africans, Americans, East Asians and South Asians), challenging the notion that some REDs are found only in specific populations. These results have worldwide implications for local and global health communities in the diagnosis and counseling of REDs."

    "abstract": "Huntington's disease (HD) is a hereditary neurodegenerative disorder that primarily affects the striatum, a brain region responsible for movement control. The disease is characterized by the mutant huntingtin (mHtt) proteins with an extended polyQ stretch, which are prone to aggregation. These mHtt aggregates accumulate in neurons and are the primary cause of the neuropathology associated with HD. To date, no effective cure for HD has been developed. The immortalized ST<i>Hdh</i> <sup><i>Q111/Q111</i></sup> striatal cell line, the mHtt-transfected wild-type ST<i>Hdh</i> <sup><i>Q7/Q7</i></sup> striatal cell line, and N2a cells were used as Huntington's disease cell models. Flow cytometry was used to assess cellular reactive oxygen species and transfection efficiency. The CCK-8 assay was used to measure cell viability, while fluorescence microscopy was used to quantify aggregates. Immunoblotting analyses were used to evaluate the effects on protein expression. Polyphenols are natural antioxidants that offer neuroprotection in neurological disorders. In this study, we provide evidence that oleuropein, the primary polyphenol in olive leaves and olive oil, enhances cell viability in HD cell models, including. ST<i>Hdh</i> <sup><i>Q7/Q7</i></sup> ST<i>Hdh</i> <sup><i>Q7/Q7</i></sup> striatal cells, N2a cells ectopically expressing the truncated mHtt, and ST<i>Hdh</i> <sup><i>Q111/Q111</i></sup> striatal cells expressing the full-length mHtt. Oleuropein effectively reduced both soluble and aggregated forms of mHtt protein in these HD model cells. Notably, the reduction of mHtt aggregates associated with oleuropein was linked to increased proteasome activity rather than changes in autophagic flux. Oleuropein seems to modulate proteasome activity through an unidentified pathway, as it did not affect the 20S proteasome catalytic β subunits, the proteasome regulator PA28γ, or multiple MAPK pathways. We demonstrated that oleuropein enhances the degradation of mHtt by increasing proteasomal protease activities and alleviates mHtt-induced cytotoxicity. Hence, we propose that oleuropein and potentially other polyphenols hold promise as a candidate for alleviating Huntington's disease."

A condition of aging, metabolic syndrome is associated with reduced brain network integrity, including functional connectivity alterations among the default mode, regions vulnerable to neurodegeneration. Prevalence of metabolic syndrome is elevated in younger populations including post-9/11 Veterans and individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder, but it is unclear whether metabolic syndrome affects brain function in earlier adulthood. Identifying early effects of metabolic syndrome on brain network integrity is critical, as these impacts could contribute to increased risk for cognitive disorders later in life for Veterans. The current study examined whether metabolic syndrome and its individual components were associated with default mode functional connectivity. We also explored the contribution of posttraumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury on these metabolic syndrome-brain relationships. Post-9/11 Veterans with combat deployment history (95 with and 325 without metabolic syndrome) underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging to capture seed-based resting-state functional connectivity within the default mode. The metabolic syndrome group demonstrated reduced positive functional connectivity between the posterior cingulate cortex seed and the bilateral superior frontal gyrus. Data-driven analyses demonstrated that metabolic syndrome components, particularly cholesterol and central adiposity, were associated with widespread reductions in default mode network connectivity. Functional connectivity was also reduced in participants with metabolic syndrome but without current posttraumatic stress disorder diagnosis and with traumatic brain injury history. These results suggest that metabolic syndrome disrupts resting-state functional connectivity decades earlier than prior work has shown."

They consist of multiple subunits, including NF-H, NF-M, and NF-L, which form long filaments along the axon's length. Neurofilaments are crucial for maintaining the shape and integrity of neurons, promoting axonal transport, and regulating neuronal function. They are part of the intermediate filament (IF) family, which has approximately 70 tissue-specific genes. This diversity allows for a customizable cytoplasmic meshwork, adapting to the unique structural demands of different tissues and cell types. Neurofilament proteins show increased levels in both cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood after neuroaxonal damage, indicating injury regardless of the underlying etiology. Precise measurement and long-term monitoring of damage are necessary for determining prognosis, assessing disease activity, tracking therapeutic responses, and creating treatments. These investigations contribute to our understanding of the importance of proper NF composition in fundamental neuronal processes and have implications for neurological disorders associated with NF abnormalities along with its alteration in different animal and human models. Here in this review, we have highlighted various neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's, Dementia, and paved the way to use neurofilament as a marker in managing neurological disorders."

Here we combine biochemistry, computation and molecular cell biology to unveil a mechanism whereby HTT coordinates a Transcription-Coupled Non-Homologous End-Joining (TC-NHEJ) complex. HTT joins TC-NHEJ proteins PNKP, Ku70/80, and XRCC4 with chromatin remodeler Brahma-related Gene 1 (BRG1) to resolve transcription-associated DSBs in brain. HTT recruitment to DSBs in transcriptionally active gene- rich regions is BRG1-dependent while efficient TC-NHEJ protein recruitment is HTT-dependent. Notably, mHTT compromises TC-NHEJ interactions and repair activity, promoting DSB accumulation in HD tissues. Importantly, HTT or PNKP overexpression restores TC-NHEJ in a <i>Drosophila</i> HD model dramatically improving genome integrity, motor defects, and lifespan. Collective results uncover HTT stimulation of DSB repair by organizing a TC-NHEJ complex that is impaired by mHTT thereby implicating dysregulation of transcription-coupled DSB repair in mHTT pathophysiology. BRG1 recruits HTT and NHEJ components to transcriptionally active DSBs.HTT joins BRG1 and PNKP to efficiently repair transcription related DSBs in brain.Mutant HTT impairs the functional integrity of TC-NHEJ complex for DSB repair.HTT expression improves DSB repair, genome integrity and phenotypes in HD flies."

Loss of the Y chromosome (LOY) in blood, which occurs naturally in aging men, has been found to be a driver of cardiac fibrosis and heart failure mortality. LOY also occurs in most solid tumors in males and is often associated with worse survival, suggesting that LOY may give tumor cells a growth or survival advantage. We analyzed LOY in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) using both bulk and single-cell expression data and found evidence suggesting that LOY affects the tumor immune environment by altering cancer/testis antigen expression and consequently facilitating tumor immune evasion. Analyzing immunotherapy data, we show that LOY and changes in expression of particular cancer/testis antigens are associated with response to pembrolizumab treatment and outcome, providing a new and powerful biomarker for predicting immunotherapy response in LUAD tumors in males."

This study investigated the effects of EMST on voluntary peak cough flow (vPCF) in HD patients and evaluated the retention of potential gains post-intervention. In this prospective case-controlled trial, 29 HD patients completed an 8-week wait-to-start period, which served to identify the natural development of expiratory muscle strength and vPCF. This was followed by 8 weeks of EMST training and an additional 8 weeks of follow-up. The study's outcome parameters, vPCF and maximum expiratory pressure (MEP), were measured against those of age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Huntington's disease patients had significantly lower MEP (p < 0.001) and vPCF (p = 0.012) compared to healthy controls at baseline. Following the EMST, significant improvements in MEP (d = 1.39, p < 0.001) and vPCF (d = 0.77, p = 0.001) were observed, with HD patients reaching the cough performance levels of healthy subjects. However, these gains diminished during the follow-up, with a significant decline in vPCF (d = -0.451, p = 0.03) and in MEP (d = -0.71; p = 0.002).

    "abstract": "Apathy is a debilitating behavioral change in Huntington's disease (HD), but impulsivity in HD has not been well documented, and the co-occurrence of these behaviors in HD has not been investigated. Our objective was to determine whether apathy and impulsivity co-occur in people with HD and their associations with quality of life. Carriers of Huntington's gene expansion (premanifest to mild motor manifest disease; n = 42) along with healthy controls (n = 20) completed measures of apathy (Apathy Evaluation Scale and Apathy Motivation Index) and impulsivity (Barratt Impulsiveness Scale-11 and UPPS-P impulsivity scale), along with mood, cognition, clinical, and quality of life measures. Apathy and impulsivity measures were each reduced to a single metric per patient using principal component analysis. Correlations and multiple linear regression models determined associations between apathy and impulsivity and the potential influence of other covariates. Apathy and impulsivity were significantly correlated (r = 0.6, p < 0.001, 95% CI [0.36, 0.76]) in HD, with this association remaining after controlling for depressive symptoms, motor disease severity, and cognitive function. Furthermore, apathy and depressive symptoms were associated with poorer quality of life. Apathy and impulsivity co-occur in individuals with premanifest to mild manifest HD and have a significant impact on wellbeing. We add to a growing evidence body that apathy and impulsivity may be intrinsically linked."

    "title": "The Potential Role of Artemisinins Against Neurodegenerative Diseases.",
    "abstract": "Artemisinin (ART) and its derivatives, collectively referred to as artemisinins (ARTs), have been approved for the treatment of malaria for decades. ARTs are converted into dihydroartemisinin (DHA), the only active form, which is reductive <i>in vivo</i>. In this review, we provide a brief overview of the neuroprotective potential of ARTs and the underlying mechanisms on several of the most common neurodegenerative diseases, particularly considering their potential application in those associated with cognitive and motor impairments including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). ARTs act as autophagy balancers to alleviate AD and PD. They inhibit neuroinflammatory responses by regulating phosphorylation of signal transduction proteins, such as AKT, PI3K, ERK, NF-κB, p38 MAPK, IκBα. In addition, ARTs regulate GABAergic signaling in a dose-dependent manner. Although they competitively inhibit the binding of gephyrin to GABAergic receptors, low doses of ARTs enhance GABAergic signaling. ARTs can also inhibit ferroptosis, activate the Akt/Bcl-2, AMPK, or ERK/CREB pathways to reduce oxidative stress, and maintain mitochondrial homeostasis, protecting neurons from oxidative stress injury. More importantly, ARTs structurally combine with and suppress β-Amyloid (A[Formula: see text]-induced neurotoxicity, reduce P-tau, and maintain O-GlcNAcylation/Phosphorylation balance, leading to relieved pathological changes in neurodegenerative diseases. Collectively, these natural properties endow ARTs with unique potential for application in neurodegenerative diseases."

    "title": "Using gene or cell therapies to treat Huntington's disease.",
    "abstract": "Huntington's disease is caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the first exon of the HTT gene, leading to the production of gain-of-toxic-function mutant huntingtin protein species and consequent transcriptional dysregulation and disrupted cell metabolism. The brunt of the disease process is borne by the striatum from the earliest disease stages, with striatal atrophy beginning approximately a decade prior to the onset of neurologic signs. Although the expanded CAG repeat in the HTT gene is necessary and sufficient to cause HD, other genes can influence the age at onset of symptoms and how they progress. Many of these modifier genes have roles in DNA repair and are likely to modulate the stability of the CAG repeat in somatic cells. Currently, there are no disease-modifying treatments for HD that can be prescribed to patients and few symptomatic treatments, but there is a lot of interest in therapeutics that can target the pathogenic pathways at the DNA and RNA levels, some of which have reached the stage of human studies. In contrast, cell therapies aim to replace key neural cells lost to the disease process and/or to support the host vulnerable striatum by direct delivery of cells to the brain. Ultimately it may be possible to combine gene and cell therapies to both slow disease processes and provide some level of neural repair. In this chapter we consider the current status of these therapeutic strategies along with their prospects and challenges."

An increased understanding of disease processes opens up opportunities for genetic therapies and precision medicine methods aiming at disease modification or repair of lesioned neurologic structures. However, such therapeutic effects may be limited or rendered ineffective by immune responses against gene products or cells used for the intended treatments. When introducing therapeutic agents into the nervous system, a set of biologic responses are inevitably triggered, which may lead to host responses that limit the intended therapeutic goals. Factors of importance include the type of vector used and origin of cells, the mode of introduction, the degree of host immunization, and any prior exposure to the agents used. It is possible to apply specific treatments that interfere with many of these steps and factors in order to limit host immunization and to reduce or eliminate host effector reactions against the therapeutic agents. This includes immune-evading design measures of the advanced therapeutic medicinal products and various immunosuppressive processes. Limited duration of specific immune modulations may be possible under carefully monitored programs."

Despite intense research into the causes of these disorders, only marginal progress has been made in the clinic and no cures exist for any of them. Most of the scientific effort has been focused on identification of the major causes of these diseases and on developing ways to target them, such as targeting amyloid accumulation for AD or targeting expression of mutant Huntingtin for HD. Calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) signaling has long been proposed to play an important role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders, but blockers of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling proteins have not been translated to clinic primarily due to side effects related to the important roles of target molecules for these compounds at the peripheral tissues. In this review article, we would like to discuss an idea that recently identified positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) of the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum calcium (SERCA) pump may provide a promising approach to develop therapeutic compounds for treatment of these disorders. This hypothesis is supported by the preclinical data obtained with animal models of AD and PD. The first critical test of this idea will be an imminent phase I study that will offer an opportunity to evaluate potential side effects of this class of compounds in humans."

As to developing effective therapeutic interventions, it is crucial to understand the underlying mechanisms of NDs. Cellular models have become invaluable tools for studying the complex pathogenesis of NDs, offering insights into disease mechanisms, determining potential therapeutic targets, and aiding in drug discovery. This review provides a comprehensive overview of various cellular models used in ND research, focusing on Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Cell lines, such as SH-SY5Y and PC12 cells, have emerged as valuable tools due to their ease of use, reproducibility, and scalability. Additionally, co-culture models, involving the growth of distinct cell types like neurons and astrocytes together, are highlighted for simulating brain interactions and microenvironment. While cell lines cannot fully replicate the complexity of the human brain, they provide a scalable method for examining important aspects of neurodegenerative diseases. Advancements in cell line technologies, including the incorporation of patient-specific genetic variants and improved co-culture models, hold promise for enhancing our understanding and expediting the development of effective treatments. Integrating multiple cellular models and advanced technologies offers the potential for significant progress in unraveling the intricacies of these debilitating diseases and improving patient outcomes."

The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement was used as a guideline, and the study protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42022354627). Eleven studies involving 1376 patients were included. There was a significant overall effect of riluzole on changes in motor function scores. However, the level of heterogeneity was <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 74%. In the subgroup analyses, there were no significant effects of riluzole on motor scores in hereditary ataxia, Parkinson's disease, or Huntington's disease. In the sensitivity analysis, there were no significant effects of riluzole on motor function scores. Furthermore, there were no significant differences in adverse events between the riluzole and placebo groups. Although riluzole may not have significant efficacy for improving motor function in neurodegenerative dyskinesia syndromes compared with placebo, it seems to have an acceptable safety profile. Moreover, it may be effective for hereditary ataxia syndromes, although there was a relatively small effect size and limited quality of evidence."

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases are the leading cause of human disability and immensely reduce patients' life span and quality. The diseases are characterized by the functional loss of neuronal cells and share several common pathogenic mechanisms involving the malfunction, structural distortion, or aggregation of multiple key regulatory proteins. Cellular phase separation is the formation of biomolecular condensates that regulate numerous biological processes, including neuronal development and synaptic signaling transduction. Aberrant phase separation may cause protein aggregation that is a general phenomenon in the neuronal cells of patients suffering neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we summarize the pathological causes of common neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease, among others. We discuss the regulation of key amyloidogenic proteins with an emphasis of their aberrant phase separation and aggregation. We also introduce the approaches as potential therapeutic strategies to ameliorate neurodegenerative diseases through intervening protein aggregation. Overall, this review consolidates the research findings of phase separation and aggregation caused by misfolded proteins in a context of neurodegenerative diseases."

Typically, PCD signaling events are precisely regulated by various biomolecules in both spatial and temporal contexts to promote neuronal development, establish neural architecture, and shape the central nervous system (CNS), although the role of PCD extends beyond the CNS. Abnormalities in PCD signaling cascades contribute to the irreversible loss of neuronal cells and function, leading to the onset and progression of neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we summarize the molecular processes and features of different modalities of PCD, including apoptosis, necroptosis, pyroptosis, ferroptosis, cuproptosis, and other novel forms of PCD, and their effects on the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), multiple sclerosis (MS), traumatic brain injury (TBI), and stroke. Additionally, we examine the key factors involved in these PCD signaling pathways and discuss the potential for their development as therapeutic targets and strategies.

Circadian rhythm-related genes code for clock proteins that rise and fall in rhythmic patterns driving biochemical signals of biological processes from metabolism to physiology and behavior. Clock proteins have a pivotal role in liver metabolism and homeostasis, and their disturbances are implicated in various liver disease processes. Encoded genes play critical roles in the initiation and progression of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and their proteins may become diagnostic markers as well as therapeutic targets. Understanding molecular and metabolic mechanisms underlying circadian rhythms will aid in therapeutic interventions and may have broader clinical applications.

This mini-review refocuses on mitochondria and emphasizes the potential of therapies leveraging mesenchymal stem cells, embryonic stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells, stem cell-derived secretions, and extracellular vesicles. Mesenchymal stem cell-mediated mitochondria transfer is highlighted for restoring mitochondrial health in cells with dysfunctional mitochondria. Additionally, attention is paid to gene-editing techniques such as mito-CRISPR, mitoTALENs, mito-ZNFs, and DdCBEs to ensure the safety and efficacy of stem cell treatments.

    "title": "Redox Homeostasis, Gut Microbiota, and Epigenetics in Neurodegenerative Diseases: A Systematic Review.",
    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases encompass a spectrum of disorders marked by the progressive degeneration of the structure and function of the nervous system. These conditions, including Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), Huntington's disease (HD), Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Multiple sclerosis (MS), often lead to severe cognitive and motor deficits. A critical component of neurodegenerative disease pathologies is the imbalance between pro-oxidant and antioxidant mechanisms, culminating in oxidative stress. The brain's high oxygen consumption and lipid-rich environment make it particularly vulnerable to oxidative damage. Pro-oxidants such as reactive nitrogen species (RNS) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) are continuously generated during normal metabolism, counteracted by enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant defenses. In neurodegenerative diseases, this balance is disrupted, leading to neuronal damage. This systematic review explores the roles of oxidative stress, gut microbiota, and epigenetic modifications in neurodegenerative diseases, aiming to elucidate the interplay between these factors and identify potential therapeutic strategies. We conducted a comprehensive search of articles published in 2024 across major databases, focusing on studies examining the relationships between redox homeostasis, gut microbiota, and epigenetic changes in neurodegeneration. A total of 161 studies were included, comprising clinical trials, observational studies, and experimental research. Our findings reveal that oxidative stress plays a central role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, with gut microbiota composition and epigenetic modifications significantly influencing redox balance. Specific bacterial taxa and epigenetic markers were identified as potential modulators of oxidative stress, suggesting novel avenues for therapeutic intervention. Moreover, recent evidence from human and animal studies supports the emerging concept of targeting redox homeostasis through microbiota and epigenetic therapies. Future research should focus on validating these targets in clinical settings and exploring the potential for personalized medicine strategies based on individual microbiota and epigenetic profiles."

    "abstract": "Precision medicine has led to the development of targeted treatment strategies tailored to individual patients based on their characteristics and disease manifestations. Although precision medicine often focuses on a single health outcome for individualized treatment decision rules (ITRs), relying only on a single outcome rather than all available outcomes information leads to suboptimal data usage when developing optimal ITRs. To address this limitation, we propose a Bayesian multivariate hierarchical model that leverages the wealth of correlated health outcomes collected in clinical trials. The approach jointly models mixed types of correlated outcomes, facilitating the \"borrowing of information\" across the multivariate outcomes, and results in a more accurate estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects compared to using single regression models for each outcome. We develop a treatment benefit index, which quantifies the relative benefit of the experimental treatment over the control treatment, based on the proposed multivariate outcome model. We demonstrate the strengths of the proposed approach through extensive simulations and an application to an international Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) treatment trial. Simulation results indicate that the proposed method reduces the occurrence of erroneous treatment decisions compared to a single regression model for a single health outcome. Additionally, the sensitivity analyses demonstrate the robustness of the model across various study scenarios. Application of the method to the COVID-19 trial exhibits improvements in estimating the individual-level treatment efficacy (indicated by narrower credible intervals for odds ratios) and optimal ITRs. The study jointly models mixed types of outcomes in the context of developing ITRs. By considering multiple health outcomes, the proposed approach can advance the development of more effective and reliable personalized treatment."

We propose pilot biologic and clinical anchors for NSD-ISS. Our results highlight the baseline heterogeneity of individuals currently defined as early PD. Baseline stage predicts time to progression to clinically meaningful milestones. Further research on validation of the anchors in longitudinal cohorts is necessary."

    "abstract": "Huntington disease (HD) is a genetic neurodegenerative disease caused by cytosine, adenine, guanine (CAG) expansion in the <i>Huntingtin</i> (<i>HTT</i>) gene, translating to an expanded polyglutamine tract in the HTT protein. Age at disease onset correlates to CAG repeat length but varies by decades between individuals with identical repeat lengths. Genome-wide association studies link HD modification to DNA repair and mitochondrial health pathways. Clinical studies show elevated DNA damage in HD, even at the premanifest stage. A major DNA repair node influencing neurodegenerative disease is the PARP pathway. Accumulation of poly adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribose (PAR) has been implicated in Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases, as well as cerebellar ataxia. We report that HD mutation carriers have lower cerebrospinal fluid PAR levels than healthy controls, starting at the premanifest stage. Human HD induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons and patient-derived fibroblasts have diminished PAR response in the context of elevated DNA damage. We have defined a PAR-binding motif in HTT, detected HTT complexed with PARylated proteins in human cells during stress, and localized HTT to mitotic chromosomes upon inhibition of PAR degradation. Direct HTT PAR binding was measured by fluorescence polarization and visualized by atomic force microscopy at the single molecule level. While wild-type and mutant HTT did not differ in their PAR binding ability, purified wild-type HTT protein increased in vitro PARP1 activity while mutant HTT did not. These results provide insight into an early molecular mechanism of HD, suggesting possible targets for the design of early preventive therapies."

The role of nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich-containing family, pyrin domain-containing-3 (NLRP3) inflammasome in HD pathogenesis remains largely uncharacterized. Parthenolide (PTL), a naturally occurring nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) inhibitor, is also known to inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome. Whether PTL is beneficial in HD has not been established yet. This study evaluated the possible neuroprotective effects of PTL against 3NP-induced behavioural abnormalities, striatal biochemical derangements, and histological aberrations. Male Wistar rats received PTL (0.5 mg/kg/day, i.p) for 3 weeks and 3NP (10 mg/kg/day, i.p) was administered alongside for the latter 2 weeks to induce HD. Finally, animals were subjected to open-field, Morris water maze and rotarod tests. Rat striata were examined histologically, striatal protein expression levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), cluster of differentiation 45 (CD45) and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) were evaluated immunohistochemically, while those of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-18, ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule-1 (Iba1) and glutamate were determined by ELISA. Striatal nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), Kelch-like ECH-associated protein (Keap1), NF-κB, NLRP3, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC), caspase-1, S100 calcium-binding protein A10 (S100A10) and complement-3 (C3) were assessed by gene expression analysis. PTL improved motor, locomotor, cognitive and anxiety-like behaviours, restored neuronal integrity, upregulated Nrf2, and inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome, NF-κB and microglial activation. Additionally, PTL induced astrocyte shifting towards the neuroprotective A2 phenotype. PTL exhibits neuroprotection against 3NP-induced HD, that might be ascribed, at least in part, to its modulatory effects on Keap1/Nrf2 and NF-κB/NLRP3 inflammasome signaling."

In this protocol, twenty-four rats were divided into four groups, each group consisting of 6 animals. Group 1: The control group received 1 % CMC 10 mg/kg, p.o. for 14 days. Groups 2, 3, and 4 received 3-NP 15 mg/kg, i.p. from Day 1 to Day 7. Groups 3 and 4 received SGZ 5 mg/kg, p.o. and 10 mg/kg, p.o. respectively once daily from day 1 to day 14. Various behavioral tests like OFT, rotarod, hanging wire, narrow beam walk, MWM, and Y-maze were performed.

Administration of 3-NP showed a significant decrease in motor coordination and cognitive function. Furthermore, 3-NP altered the activity of acetylcholinesterase, anti-oxidant enzymes, Nrf-2, NF-κB, BDNF, CREB levels, and histological features. However, treatment with SGZ showed ameliorative effects in the 3-NP induced neurotoxicity via PPAR α/γ pathway by reducing motor dysfunction, memory impairment, cholinesterase levels, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation. It also enhanced the levels of Nrf-2, BDNF, and CREB expression and improved histological features.

We demonstrated the utility of our model in two cohort studies: the Strong Heart Study cohort (SHS), a prospective cohort studying cardiovascular disease and its risk factors among American Indians adults; the Women's Health Initiative (WHI), a prospective cohort study including randomized clinical trials and observational study to improve postmenopausal women's health with one of the main focuses on cardiovascular disease. Our AESurv model effectively learned participant representations in low-dimensional latent space and achieved better model performance (concordance index-C index of 0.864 ± 0.009 and time-to-event mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve-AUROC of 0.905 ± 0.009) than other survival analysis models (Cox proportional hazard, Cox proportional hazard deep neural network survival analysis, random survival forest, and gradient boosting survival analysis models) in the SHS.

    "title": "Predicting age of onset and progression of disease in late-onset genetic neurodegenerative diseases: An ethics review and research agenda.",
    "abstract": "Currently, a prognostic biomarker-based model is being developed to predict the onset and disease progression of Huntington's Disease (HD) and Spinocerebellar Ataxia (SCA) types 1 and 3, both late-onset genetic neurodegenerative diseases lacking a disease-modifying treatment (DMT). The need for more accurate predictions of onset and disease progression arises in the context of clinical trials evaluating the effectiveness of potential DMTs and identifying the optimal time to initiate such a DMT. Moreover, such a prognostic model may provide mutation carriers with personal utility. The aim of this article is to anticipate the ethical issues raised by these new prognostic models and to formulate the ethical issues that need to be addressed to facilitate an ethically responsible development and implementation of such a model. Part one of this article describes the ethical issues raised by presymptomatic genetic testing for HD and evaluates whether and how these issues may also occur by predicting onset and disease progression. Part two presents the results of a critical interpretative review into the ethical issues raised by biomarker testing in other late-onset neurodegenerative diseases lacking a DMT. The review aims to identify new ethical issues related to biomarker testing for predicting the onset and disease progression of HD and SCA. Finally, based on parts one and two, part three proposes a research agenda for the near future regarding the most pressing ethical issues that need to be addressed to ensure an ethically responsible implementation of such a prognostic model in both research settings and clinical practice."

    "title": "A framework for translating tauopathy therapeutics: Drug discovery to clinical trials.",
    "abstract": "The tauopathies are defined by pathological tau protein aggregates within a spectrum of clinically heterogeneous neurodegenerative diseases. The primary tauopathies meet the definition of rare diseases in the United States. There is no approved treatment for primary tauopathies. In this context, designing the most efficient development programs to translate promising targets and treatments from preclinical studies to early-phase clinical trials is vital. In September 2022, the Rainwater Charitable Foundation convened an international expert workshop focused on the translation of tauopathy therapeutics through early-phase trials. Our report on the workshop recommends a framework for principled drug development and a companion lexicon to facilitate communication focusing on reproducibility and achieving common elements. Topics include the selection of targets, drugs, biomarkers, participants, and study designs. The maturation of pharmacodynamic biomarkers to demonstrate target engagement and surrogate disease biomarkers is a crucial unmet need. HIGHLIGHTS: Experts provided a framework to translate therapeutics (discovery to clinical trials). Experts focused on the \"5 Rights\" (target, drug, biomarker, participants, trial). Current research on frontotemporal degeneration, progressive supranuclear palsy, and corticobasal syndrome therapeutics includes 32 trials (37% on biologics) Tau therapeutics are being tested in Alzheimer's disease; primary tauopathies have a large unmet need."

    "title": "Clonal Evolution in 207 Cases of Refractory or Relapsed Acute Myeloid Leukemia.",
    "abstract": "Clonal evolution (CE) is a driving force behind the development and progression of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Advances in molecular and cytogenetic assays have improved the depth and breadth of detection of CE in AML, which is defined here as a detected change in cytogenetic or molecular profile at relapsed or refractory (RR) disease. In this study, we demonstrate the clinical impact of CE in a cohort of patients with RR AML treated between 2013 and 2023. We discovered CE is significantly more frequent in relapsed disease (58.2%, [46.6%, 69.2%]) than in refractory disease (21.1%, [14.4%, 29.2%], p < 0.001). CE negatively impacts prognosis when detected by conventional karyotyping in refractory disease (4.2 vs. 13.9 months, p < 0.011). In contrast with prior literature, CE had no impact on overall survival if detected in relapsed disease. Surprisingly, those who achieved negative measurable residual disease (MRD) were no more likely to eliminate their original clone than those who did not (p = 1). We found several cytogenetic and molecular signatures which may predispose to CE: aberrations of chromosome 17, trisomy 8, TP53, KRAS, and FLT3-TKD. Finally, physicians were less likely to retreat those with CE with IC after receiving IC as first-line therapy (35.0% vs. 70.9%, p = 0.004). This study illustrates the role of CE in chemotherapy-resistant AML; we identify unique cytogenetic and molecular signatures that define a subset of patients associated with a dismal prognosis. As next-generation sequencing panels expand and new methods to characterize cytogenetic abnormalities emerge, our findings establish a basis for future studies investigating the prognostic and therapeutic impact of CE."

    "abstract": "The Neuronal alpha-Synuclein Disease (NSD) biological definition and Integrated Staging System (NSD-ISS) provide a research framework to identify individuals with Lewy body pathology and stage them based on underlying biology and increasing degree of functional impairment. Utilizing data from the PPMI, PASADENA and SPARK studies, we developed and applied biologic and clinical data-informed definitions for the NSD-ISS across the disease continuum. Individuals enrolled as Parkinson's disease, Prodromal, or Healthy Controls were defined and staged based on biological, clinical, and functional anchors at baseline. Across the three studies 1,741 participants had SAA data and of these 1,030 (59%) were S+ consistent with NSD. Among sporadic PD, 683/736 (93%) were NSD, and the distribution for Stages 2B, 3, and 4 was 25%, 63%, and 9%, respectively. Median (95% CI) time to developing a clinically meaningful outcome was 8.3 (6.2, 10.1), 5.9 (4.1, 6.0), and 2.4 (1.0, 4.0) years for baseline stage 2B, 3, and 4, respectively. We propose pilot biologic and clinical anchors for NSD-ISS. Our results highlight the baseline heterogeneity of individuals currently defined as early PD. Baseline stage predicts time to progression to clinically meaningful milestones. Further research on validation of the anchors in longitudinal cohorts is necessary."

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative disorders like Huntington's disease (HD) are a major threat to human health, with severe gait abnormalities and pathological changes (oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and apoptosis) playing important roles in their development. The effects of artemisinin (ART) alone and in combination with the ERK antagonist PD98059 against 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NPA)-induced cell death and oxidative stress in SH-SY5Y cells were determined using the MTT and DCFH-DA assays, as well as RT-qPCR assays. In vivo, possible neuroprotective effects of ART (10, 20, and 40 mg/kg i.p.) against the neurotoxicity generated by 21-day 3-NPA (10 mg/kg i.p.) treatment was evaluated in rats by assessing behavioral parameters on days 1, 14, and 21. Further, various biochemical, inflammatory, apoptotic markers, histopathological changes, and protein expression were assessed using brain striatal samples. ART significantly mitigated the neurotoxic effect of 3-NPA in SH-SY5Y cells by regulating the mRNA expression of ERK, Bax, Bcl2, and cytochrome C. However, ART's neuroprotective activity was reduced in the presence of PD98059. Also, ART treatment for 21 days substantially alleviated the behavioral impairments associated with 3-NPA toxicity. It reduced the oxidative stress induced by 3-NPA, as evidenced by the lower levels of MDA, nitrite, and improved catalase, SOD activity, and GSH levels. ART treatment restored 3-NPA-induced histopathological alterations in the striatal area. ART effectively suppressed neuroinflammatory (IL-6) and apoptotic markers (caspase 3 and 9), increasing BDNF levels and restoring the p-ERK1/2, Nrf2, and HO-1 expression. ART could exert its neuroprotective effect via antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiapoptotic properties with a possible involvement of the ERK/BDNF/Nrf2/HO-1 pathway."

    "abstract": "This study delineated the intricate relation between cholesterol metabolism, protein degradation mechanisms, and the pathogenesis of Huntington's disease (HD). Through investigations using both animal models and cellular systems, we have observed significant alterations in cholesterol levels, particularly in the striatum, which is the primary lesion site in HD. Our findings indicate the dysregulation of cholesterol metabolism-related factors, such as LDLR and SREBP2, in HD, which may contribute to disease progression. Additionally, we uncovered disruptions in protein degradation pathways, including decreased neddylated proteins and dysregulated autophagy, which further exacerbated HD pathology. Moreover, our study highlighted the potential therapeutic implications of targeting these pathways. By restoring cholesterol levels and modulating protein degradation mechanisms, particularly through interventions, such as MLN4924, we observed potential improvements in cellular function, as indicated by the increased BDNF levels. These insights underscore the importance of simultaneously addressing cholesterol metabolism and protein degradation to alleviate HD pathology. Collectively, this study provides a basic understanding of the interplay between the decrease of SREBP2 and the dysfunctional protein degradation system derived from disrupted cholesterol metabolism in HD and HD cells."

    "abstract": "Individuals with Huntington's disease (HD) experience increased difficulty with balance throughout disease progression. Adding a simultaneous cognitive task to a balance assessment, referred to as a dual task (DT) paradigm, may have a deleterious effect on balance, which can be expressed in terms of a Dual Task Cost (DTC), relative to a single task (ST) condition. The aim of this study is to explore whether a cognitive-motor DT paradigm uncovers balance deficits in prodromal (Pro-HD) and manifest HD, compared to healthy adults (HA). Balance under ST and DT conditions was examined using the BTracks Balance Plate and Balance software in 30 individuals with HD, 17 individuals with Pro-HD, and 20 HA. During the DT condition, participants were simultaneously administered a version of the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT). DTC is calculated as the relative ratio of ST to DT, controlling for ST performance: DTC= (ST - DT)/ST x100. The HA group performed significantly better than the HD group on both the ST and DT conditions (p < 0.01), while balance scores between the HA and the Pro-HD groups were not significantly different. The DTC scores, however, were significantly better in the HA compared to both the HD (p < 0.001) and Pro-HD (p < 0.05) groups. Our findings indicate that the addition of a cognitive task interferes with participant's balance, reflecting real-life performance, and may have additional value for estimating transition to manifest disease, appraising fall risk, or serving as a valid outcome measure in observational and interventional trials in HD."

    "abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common mental illness. The traditional Chinese medicine compound Xiaojian Zhongtang (XJZT) has a good therapeutic effect on MDD, but the specific mechanism is not clear. The aim of this study is to explore the molecular mechanism of XJZT in the treatment of MDD through network pharmacology and bioinformatics. The traditional Chinese medicine system pharmacology database was used to screen the chemical components and targets of XJZT, while the online Mendelian inheritance in man, DisGeNET, Genecards, and therapeutic target database databases were used to collect MDD targets and identify the intersection targets of XJZT and MDD. A \"drugs-components-targets\" network was constructed using the Cytoscape platform, and the STRING was used for protein-protein interaction analysis of intersecting targets. Gene Ontology and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes analysis of intersecting targets was performed using the DAVID database. Obtain serum and brain transcriptome datasets of MDD from the gene expression omnibus database, and perform differentially expressed genes, weighted gene co-expression network analysis, gene set enrichment analysis, and receiver operating characteristic analysis. A total of 127 chemical components and 767 targets were obtained from XJZT, among which quercetin, kaempferol, and maltose are the core chemical components, and 1728 MDD targets were screened out, with 77 intersecting targets between XJZT and MDD. These targets mainly involve AGE-RAGE signaling pathway in diabetic complexes, epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance, and HIF-1 signaling pathway, and these core targets have strong binding activity with core components. In addition, 1166 differentially expressed genes were identified in the MDD serum transcriptome dataset, and weighted gene co-expression network analysis identified the most relevant gene modules (1269 genes), among which RAC-alpha serine/threonine-protein kinase (AKT1), D(4) dopamine receptor (DRD4), and kynurenine 3-monooxygenase (KMO) were target genes for the treatment of MDD with XJZT, these 3 genes are mainly related to the ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism, and Huntington disease pathways, and the expression of AKT1, DRD4, and KMO was also found in the MDD brain transcriptome dataset, which is significantly correlated with the occurrence of MDD. We have identified 3 key targets for XJZT treatment of MDD, including AKT1, KMO, and DRD4, and they can be regulated by the key components of XJZT, including quercetin, maltose, and kaempferol. This provides valuable insights for the early clinical diagnosis and development of therapeutic drugs for MDD."

Emerging evidence suggests the gut microbiota plays a role in their pathogenesis, though the influences of specific bacteria on disease-associated proteins remain elusive. Here, we reveal the effects of 229 human bacterial isolates on the aggregation and toxicity of Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>, α-synuclein, and polyglutamine tracts in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> expressing these culprit proteins. Our findings demonstrate that bacterial effects on host protein aggregation are consistent across different culprit proteins, suggesting that microbes affect protein stability by modulating host proteostasis rather than selectively targeting disease-associated proteins. Furthermore, we found that feeding <i>C. elegans</i> proteoprotective <i>Prevotella corporis</i> activates the heat shock response, revealing an unexpected discovery of a microbial influence on host proteostasis. Insight into how individual bacteria affect PCD proteins could open new strategies for prevention and treatment by altering the abundance of microbes."

    "abstract": "The corpus callosum, the largest white matter structure in the brain, plays a crucial role in interhemispheric communication and cognitive function. This review examines the microstructural changes observed in the corpus callosum across various neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). New neuroimaging studies, mainly those that use diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and advanced tractography methods, were put together to show how changes have happened in the organization of white matter and the connections between them. Some of the most common ways the corpus callosum breaks down are discussed, including less fractional anisotropy, higher mean diffusivity, and atrophy in certain regions. The relationship between these microstructural changes and cognitive decline, motor dysfunction, and disease progression is explored. Additionally, we consider the potential of corpus callosum imaging as a biomarker for early disease detection and monitoring. Studies show that people with these disorders have lower fractional anisotropy and higher mean diffusivity in the corpus callosum, often in ways that are specific to the disease. These changes often happen before gray matter atrophy and are linked to symptoms, which suggests that the corpus callosum could be used as an early sign of neurodegeneration. The review also highlights the implications of these findings for understanding disease mechanisms and developing therapeutic strategies. Future directions, including the application of advanced imaging techniques and longitudinal studies, are discussed to elucidate the role of corpus callosum degeneration in neurodegenerative processes. This review underscores the importance of the corpus callosum in understanding the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases and its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions."

    "abstract": "Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by a mutant huntingtin protein with an abnormal CAG/polyQ expansion in the N-terminus of HTT exon 1. HD is characterized by progressive neurodegeneration and metabolic abnormalities, particularly in the brain, which accounts for approximately 20 % of the body's resting metabolic rate. Dysregulation of energy homeostasis in HD includes impaired glucose transporters, abnormal functions of glycolytic enzymes, changes in tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle activity and enzyme expression in the basal ganglia and cortical regions of both HD mouse models and HD patients. However, current understanding of brain cell behavior during energy dysregulation and its impact on neuron-glia crosstalk in HD remains limited. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the current understanding of the differences in glucose metabolism between neurons and glial cells in HD and how these differences contribute to disease development compared with normal conditions. We also discuss the potential impact of metabolic shifts on neuron-glia communication in HD. A deeper understanding of these metabolic alterations may reveal potential therapeutic targets for future drug development."

Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Huntington's disease (HD) are prominently life-threatening examples of neurodegenerative diseases. The complexity of the pathophysiology in neurodegenerative diseases causes difficulties in diagnosing. Although the drugs temporarily help to correct specific symptoms including memory loss and degeneration, a complete treatment has not been found yet. New therapeutic approaches have been developed to understand and treat the underlying pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. With this purpose, clustered-regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein (CRISPR/Cas) technology has recently suggested a new treatment option. Editing of the genome is carried out by insertion and deletion processes on DNA. Safe delivery of the CRISPR/Cas system to the targeted cells without affecting surrounding cells is frequently investigated. Extracellular vesicles (EVs), that is exosomes, have recently been used in CRISPR/Cas studies. In this review, CRISPR/Cas and EV approaches used for diagnosis and/or treatment in AD, PD, ALS, and HD are reviewed. CRISPR/Cas and EV technologies, which stand out as new therapeutic approaches, may offer a definitive treatment option in neurodegenerative diseases."

These interventions, however, do not modify the progressive course of the disease. More recently, disease-modifying experimental therapeutic strategies have emerged targeting intrastriatal infusion of neurotrophic factors, cell transplantation, HTT gene silencing, and delivery of intrabodies.

    "abstract": "Up-to-date estimates of stroke burden and attributable risks and their trends at global, regional, and national levels are essential for evidence-based health care, prevention, and resource allocation planning. We aimed to provide such estimates for the period 1990-2021. We estimated incidence, prevalence, death, and disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) counts and age-standardised rates per 100 000 people per year for overall stroke, ischaemic stroke, intracerebral haemorrhage, and subarachnoid haemorrhage, for 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2021. We also calculated burden of stroke attributable to 23 risk factors and six risk clusters (air pollution, tobacco smoking, behavioural, dietary, environmental, and metabolic risks) at the global and regional levels (21 GBD regions and Socio-demographic Index [SDI] quintiles), using the standard GBD methodology. 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) for each individual future estimate were derived from the 2·5th and 97·5th percentiles of distributions generated from propagating 500 draws through the multistage computational pipeline. In 2021, stroke was the third most common GBD level 3 cause of death (7·3 million [95% UI 6·6-7·8] deaths; 10·7% [9·8-11·3] of all deaths) after ischaemic heart disease and COVID-19, and the fourth most common cause of DALYs (160·5 million [147·8-171·6] DALYs; 5·6% [5·0-6·1] of all DALYs). In 2021, there were 93·8 million (89·0-99·3) prevalent and 11·9 million (10·7-13·2) incident strokes. We found disparities in stroke burden and risk factors by GBD region, country or territory, and SDI, as well as a stagnation in the reduction of incidence from 2015 onwards, and even some increases in the stroke incidence, death, prevalence, and DALY rates in southeast Asia, east Asia, and Oceania, countries with lower SDI, and people younger than 70 years. Globally, ischaemic stroke constituted 65·3% (62·4-67·7), intracerebral haemorrhage constituted 28·8% (28·3-28·8), and subarachnoid haemorrhage constituted 5·8% (5·7-6·0) of incident strokes. There were substantial increases in DALYs attributable to high BMI (88·2% [53·4-117·7]), high ambient temperature (72·4% [51·1 to 179·5]), high fasting plasma glucose (32·1% [26·7-38·1]), diet high in sugar-sweetened beverages (23·4% [12·7-35·7]), low physical activity (11·3% [1·8-34·9]), high systolic blood pressure (6·7% [2·5-11·6]), lead exposure (6·5% [4·5-11·2]), and diet low in omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (5·3% [0·5-10·5]). Stroke burden has increased from 1990 to 2021, and the contribution of several risk factors has also increased. Effective, accessible, and affordable measures to improve stroke surveillance, prevention (with the emphasis on blood pressure, lifestyle, and environmental factors), acute care, and rehabilitation need to be urgently implemented across all countries to reduce stroke burden.

    "abstract": "Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited neurodegenerative disease characterized by neuropsychiatric symptoms including chorea, dementia, and depression. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion and exhibits anticipation leading to earlier and more severe symptoms in the affected offspring of a patient. With a much lower prevalence in Asia than in Europe and other parts of the world, its diagnosis can be missed easily in the early stages due to mildness of the symptoms and significant overlap between its symptoms and those of other diseases. We present the case of a 38-year-old male of Pashtun ethnicity presenting with mild cognitive impairment and clumsiness who was eventually diagnosed with HD, but his mild clinical features, no documented history of HD in his parents, and his relatively young age coupled with the relatively low prevalence of HD in his geographical location presented a significant challenge in our diagnosis of his condition. This case underscores the importance of keeping a high clinical suspicion for HD in patients with chorea despite a negative parental history, especially in resource-limited areas where the parents may have gone undiagnosed and highlights the need for further research on HD's prevalence in different parts of the world as well as the barriers to its diagnosis."

    "abstract": "Huntington's disease (HD) and spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) are the two most prevalent polyglutamine (polyQ) neurodegenerative diseases, caused by CAG (encoding glutamine) repeat expansion in the coding region of the huntingtin (HTT) and ataxin-3 (ATXN3) proteins, respectively. We have earlier reported that the activity, but not the protein level, of an essential DNA repair enzyme, polynucleotide kinase 3'-phosphatase (PNKP), is severely abrogated in both HD and SCA3 resulting in accumulation of double-strand breaks in patients' brain genome. While investigating the mechanistic basis for the loss of PNKP activity and accumulation of DNA double-strand breaks leading to neuronal death, we observed that PNKP interacts with the nuclear isoform of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase 3 (PFKFB3). Depletion of PFKFB3 markedly abrogates PNKP activity without changing its protein level. Notably, the levels of both PFKFB3 and its product fructose-2,6 bisphosphate (F2,6BP), an allosteric modulator of glycolysis, are significantly lower in the nuclear extracts of postmortem brain tissues of HD and SCA3 patients. Supplementation of F2,6BP restored PNKP activity in the nuclear extracts of patients' brain. Moreover, intracellular delivery of F2,6BP restored both the activity of PNKP and the integrity of transcribed genome in neuronal cells derived from the striatum of the HD mouse. Importantly, supplementing F2,6BP rescued the HD phenotype in Drosophila, suggesting F2,6BP to serve in vivo as a cofactor for the proper functionality of PNKP and thereby, of brain health. Our results thus provide a compelling rationale for exploring the therapeutic use of F2,6BP and structurally related compounds for treating polyQ diseases."

    "abstract": "Dysregulated protein homeostasis, characterized by abnormal protein accumulation and aggregation, is a key contributor to the progression of neurodegenerative disorders such as Huntington's disease and spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3). Previous studies have identified PIAS1 gene variants in patients with late-onset SCA3 and Huntington's disease. This study aims to elucidate the role of PIAS1 and its S510G variant in modulating the pathogenic mechanisms of SCA3. Through in vitro biochemical analyses and in vivo assays, we demonstrate that PIAS1 stabilizes both wild-type and mutant ataxin-3 (ATXN3). The PIAS1 S510G variant, however, selectively reduces the stability and SUMOylation of mutant ATXN3, thereby decreasing its aggregation and toxicity while maintaining the stability of wild-type ATXN3. This effect is mediated by a weakened interaction with the SUMO-conjugating enzyme UBC9 in the presence of mutant ATXN3. In Drosophila models, downregulation of dPIAS1 resulted in reduced levels of mutant ATXN3 and alleviated associated phenotypes, including retinal degeneration and motor dysfunction. Our findings suggest that the PIAS1 S510G variant acts as a genetic modifier of SCA3, highlighting the potential of targeting SUMOylation as a therapeutic strategy for this disease."

In this study we used directional tract density patterns (dTDPs) to evaluate changes in interhemispheric connectivity in gene-expanded individuals, which included presymptomatic and early symptomatic HD subjects. Our results demonstrated regionally selective and progressive differences in dTDPs between distinct regions of the corpus callosum (subdivided by Hofer-Frahm scheme) in the gene-expanded cohorts. In the presymptomatic HD cohort, we found trends, such that the density of fibers was reduced in CC regions IIb, III, and IV (p < 0.05); fibers from these regions project to sensory, premotor, and motor cortical regions, respectively. In the HD cohort, we found reduction in the density of fibers in all CC regions, including in fibers extending to the cortical surface (p < 0.002). Our results support the use of dTDPs to evaluate individual and progressive changes in interhemispheric connectivity in HD."

Their ubiquitous expression in metazoan cell types controls cell proliferation and differentiation during development. This comprehensive review delves into the biological roles of KAT3A and KAT3B in neurodevelopment, shedding light on how alterations in their regulation or activity can potentially contribute to a spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Huntington's and Alzheimer's). We explore the pathophysiological implications of KAT3 function loss in these disorders, considering their conserved protein domains and biochemical functions in chromatin regulation. The discussion also underscores the crucial role of KAT3 proteins and their substrates in supporting the integration of key cell signaling pathways. Furthermore, the narrative highlights the interdependence of KAT3-mediated lysine acetylation with lysine methylation and arginine methylation. From a cellular perspective, KAT3-dependent signal integration at subnuclear domains is mediated by liquid-liquid phase separation in response to KAT3-mediated lysine acetylation. The disruption of these finely tuned regulatory processes underscores their pathological roles in neurodegeneration. This review also points to the exciting potential for future research in this field, inspiring further investigation and discovery in the area of neurodevelopment and neurodegenerative diseases."

    "title": "Inflammatory bowel disease and pulmonary embolism: a nationwide perspective.",
    "abstract": "To examine the characteristics and outcomes of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) hospitalized with pulmonary embolism (PE). This cross-sectional observational study analyzed data from the 2016 to 2019 National Inpatient Sample to investigate hospitalizations for PE in the USA, stratified by the presence or absence of IBD. Adult patients were selected using the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision codes for PE, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis. Data on patient demographics, comorbidities, and hospital characteristics were collected. Statistical analysis included univariable and multivariable logistic regression using Stata/BE 17.0, focusing on in-hospital mortality and complications in PE patients with and without IBD. Adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated when appropriate. PE/IBD group was younger (mean age 58.3 vs. 62.7 years; P < 0.001), had a higher proportion of white patients (81.2% vs. 70.9%; P < 0.001), and had a greater prevalence of chronic liver disease (7.54% vs. 6.02%; P = 0.002) when compared to PE/non-IBD patients. The PE/IBD group had lower prevalence rates of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, obesity, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, and diabetes. Regarding primary outcomes, there was no significant difference in in-hospital mortality between the two groups (aOR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.77-1.09; P = 0.355). However, the IBD/PE group had a higher risk of acute kidney injury, sepsis, septic shock, cardiac arrhythmias, and deep vein thrombosis. As for secondary outcomes, PE/IBD patients had more extended hospital stays and higher healthcare costs compared with PE/non-IBD patients. Hospitalized PE patients with IBD differ demographically and have a different comorbidity profile compared to those without IBD. PE/IBD patients demonstrate greater use of healthcare resources and elevated risk of hospitalization adverse events than PE/non-IBD patients, highlighting the necessity for individualized management approaches in this population."

    "title": "The psychometric properties of the Quality of Life in Neurological Disorders (Neuro-QoL) measurement system in neurorehabilitation populations: a systematic review.",
    "abstract": "To systematically review the literature of existing evidence on the measurement properties of the Quality of Life in Neurological Disorders (Neuro-QoL) measurement system among neurorehabilitation populations. The Consensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement Instruments (COSMIN) guided this systematic review in which we searched nine electronic databases and registries, and hand-searched reference lists of included articles. Two independent reviewers screened selected articles and extracted data from 28 included studies. COSMIN's approach guided extraction and synthesizing measurement properties evidence (insufficient, sufficient), and the modified GRADE approach guided synthesizing evidence quality (very-low, low, moderate, high) by diagnosis. Neuro-QoL has sufficient measurement properties when used by individuals with Huntington's disease, Multiple Sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, stroke, lupus, cognitive decline, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The strongest evidence is for the first four conditions, where test-retest reliability, construct validity, and responsiveness are nearly always sufficient (GRADE: moderate-high). Structural validity is assessed only in multiple sclerosis and stroke but is often insufficient (GRADE: moderate-high). Criterion validity is sufficient in some stroke and Huntington's disease domains (GRADE: high). Item response theory analyses were reported for some stroke domains only. There is limited, mixed evidence for responsiveness and measurement error (GRADE: moderate-high), and no cross-cultural validity evidence CONCLUSIONS: Neuro-QoL domains can describe and evaluate patients with Huntington's disease, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, and stroke, but predictive validity evidence would be beneficial. In the other conditions captured in this review, a limited number of Neuro-QoL domains have evidence for descriptive use only. For these conditions, further evidence of structural validity, measurement error, cross-cultural validity and predictive validity would enhance the use and interpretation of Neuro-QoL."

    "abstract": "Autophagy, a lysosome-dependent protein degradation mechanism, is a highly conserved catabolic process seen in all eukaryotes. This cell protection system, which is present in all tissues and functions at a basic level, can be up- or downregulated in response to various stresses. A disruption in the natural route of the autophagy process is frequently followed by an interruption in the inherent operation of the body's cells and organs. Probiotics are live bacteria that protect the host through various mechanisms. One of the processes through which probiotics exert their beneficial effects on various cells and tissues is autophagy. Autophagy can assist in maintaining host homeostasis by stimulating the immune system and affecting numerous physiological and pathological responses. In this review, we particularly focus on autophagy impairments occurring in several human illnesses and investigate how probiotics affect the autophagy process under various circumstances.<b>Abbreviation</b>: AD: Alzheimer disease; AKT: AKT serine/threonine kinase; AMPK: 5'AMP-activated protein kinase; ATG: autophagy related; CCl<sub>4</sub>: carbon tetrachloride; CFS: cell-free supernatant; CMA: chaperone-mediated autophagy; CRC: colorectal cancer; EPS: <i>L.</i> <i>plantarum</i> H31 exopolysaccharide; HD: Huntington disease; HFD: high-fat diet; HPV: human papillomavirus; IFNG/IFN-γ: interferon gamma; IL6: interleukin 6; LGG: <i>L. rhamnosus</i> GG; LPS: lipopolysaccharide; MTOR: mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase; MTORC1: MTOR complex 1; NAFLD: non-alcoholic fatty liver disease; NASH: non-alcoholic steatohepatitis; PD: Parkinson disease; Pg3G: pelargonidin-3-O-glucoside; PI3K: phosphoinositide 3-kinase; PolyQ: polyglutamine; ROS: reactive oxygen species; SCFAs: short-chain fatty acids; SLAB51: a novel formulation of lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria; Slp: surface layer protein (of acidophilus NCFM); SNCA: synuclein alpha; ULK1: unc-51 like autophagy-activating kinase 1; YB: <i>B.</i> <i>longum</i> subsp. <i>infantis</i> YB0411; YFP: yeast fermentate prebiotic."

    "title": "Evaluating AlphaFold for Clinical Pharmacology and Pharmacogenetics: A Case-Study of Huntingtin Variants Linked to Huntington's Disease.",
    "abstract": "To evaluate the artificial intelligence (AI)-guided AlphaFold algorithm for studying the binding interactions of human huntingtin and the aggregation of huntingtin peptides. Variants of huntingtin protein implicated in Huntington's disease were used as a model system to evaluate AlphaFold. Variants of huntingtin and huntingtin peptides with polyglutamine tracts (PQT) containing 21, 31, 51, or 78 glutamines were studied. The 3-dimensional structures of huntingtin variants and their interactions with huntingtin-associated protein-40 (HAP40) were obtained. Aggregation experiments were conducted with peptide sequences corresponding to variants of PQT, amino terminal sequence (NTS) plus PQT, NTS plus PQT plus proline rich region (PRR), and the 300 amino acid sequence from the NTS through HEAT3 of huntingtin. Oligomerization experiments with 1, 3, 6, or 12 peptide sequences were used to assess the quaternary structures of aggregates. The PQT and PQT plus NTS peptides formed a helical secondary structure that formed a central core in the quaternary structure of the aggregates The PRR formed an extended type II polyproline helix that did not participate in central core the aggregates. The distance between the amino and carboxyl termini of disease-linked 31Q, 51Q, and 78Q variants of full-length huntingtin was prominently decreased compared to the 21Q huntingtin. The interaction of HAP40 with the 78Q variant increased the distance between the amino and carboxyl termini. AlphaFold identified key tertiary structure changes in human huntingtin that have been independently corroborated in experimental models. The results highlight the utility of AlphaFold for hypothesis generation in pharmaceutical research."

    "title": "Higher sodium in older individuals or after stroke/reperfusion, but not in migraine or Alzheimer's disease - a study in different preclinical models.",
    "abstract": "Sodium serves as one of the primary cations in the central nervous system, playing a crucial role in maintaining normal brain function. In this study, we investigated alterations in sodium concentrations in the brain and/or cerebrospinal fluid across multiple models, including an aging model, a stroke model, a nitroglycerin (NTG)-induced rat migraine model, a familial hemiplegic migraine type 2 (FHM2) mouse model, and a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Our results reveal that older rats exhibited higher sodium concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), plasma, and various brain regions compared to their younger counterparts. Additionally, findings from the stroke model demonstrated a significant increase in sodium in the ischemic/reperfused region, accompanied by a decrease in potassium and an elevated sodium/potassium ratio. However, we did not detect significant changes in sodium in the NTG-induced rat migraine model or the FHM2 mouse model. Furthermore, AD transgenic mice showed no significant differences in sodium levels compared to wild-type mice in CSF, plasma, or the hippocampus. These results underscore the nuanced regulation of sodium homeostasis in various neurological conditions and aging, providing valuable insights into potential mechanisms underlying these alterations."

    "abstract": "Cockayne syndrome (CS) is an autosomal recessive disorder of developmental delay, multiple organ system degeneration and signs of premature ageing. We show here, using the RNA-seq data from two CS mutant cell lines, that the CS key transcriptional signature displays significant enrichment of neurodegeneration terms, including genes relevant in Huntington disease (HD). By using deep learning approaches and two published RNA-Seq datasets, the CS transcriptional signature highly significantly classified and predicted HD and control samples. Neurodegeneration is one hallmark of CS disease, and fibroblasts from CS patients with different causative mutations display disturbed ribosomal biogenesis and a consecutive loss of protein homeostasis - proteostasis. Encouraged by the transcriptomic data, we asked whether this pathomechanism is also active in HD. In different HD cell-culture models, we showed that mutant Huntingtin impacts ribosomal biogenesis and function. This led to an error-prone protein synthesis and, as shown in different mouse models and human tissue, whole proteome instability, and a general loss of proteostasis."

    "title": "Characterization of fission and fusion mitochondrial dynamics in HD fibroblasts according to patient's severity status.",
    "abstract": "Huntington's Disease (HD) is an inheritable neurodegenerative condition caused by an expanded CAG trinucleotide repeat in the HTT gene with a direct correlation between CAG repeats expansion and disease severity with earlier onset-of- disease. Previously we have shown that primary skin fibroblasts from HD patients exhibit unique phenotype disease features, including distinct nuclear morphology and perturbed actin cap linked with cell motility, that are correlated with the HD patient disease severity. Here we provide further evidence that mitochondrial fission-fusion morphology balance dynamics, classified using a custom image-based high-content analysis (HCA) machine learning tool, that improved correlation with HD severity status. This mitochondrial phenotype is supported by appropriate changes in fission-fusion biomarkers (Drp1, MFN1, MFN2, VAT1) levels in the HD patients' fibroblasts. These findings collectively point towards a dysregulation in mitochondrial dynamics, where both fission and fusion processes may be disrupted in HD cells compared to healthy controls. This study shows for the first time a methodology that enables identification of HD phenotype before patient's disease onset (Premanifest). Therefore, we believe that this tool holds a potential for improving precision in HD patient's diagnostics bearing the potential to evaluate alterations in mitochondrial dynamics throughout the progression of HD, offering valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms and drug therapy evaluation underlying biological differences in any disease stage."

We propose a sophisticated measurement error correction method that can handle potentially correlated measurement errors in longitudinally collected exposures and multiple outcomes. The asymptotic theory for the proposed method is developed. A simulation study is conducted to demonstrate the satisfactory performance of the proposed two-stage fitting method and shows that the independent working correlation structure outperforms other alternatives. We conduct a comprehensive longitudinal analysis to assess how brain striatal atrophy affects impairment in various cognitive domains for Huntington's disease."

    "abstract": "There are limited studies examining local control (LC) and overall survival (OS) following stereotactic ablative radiation therapy (SABR) for adolescent and young adult (AYA) populations/histologies with local recurrences or metastatic disease. The RSSearch® Patient Registry, an international SABR registry, was evaluated for AYA patients treated with SABR. AYA patients with adult histologies/primaries were excluded. Kaplan-Meier analyses were employed to characterize LC and OS following SABR. Potential prognostic factors were assessed with log-rank tests for initial univariate analysis (UVA). For multivariate analyses (MVA), a Cox proportional hazards multivariate model was utilized. A total of 19 AYA patients with 39 lesions treated with SABR were identified and included in the analysis. Four lesions (10.3%) were treated with SABR for primary tumor recurrence and 35 lesions were treated for metastatic disease. The median patient age was 34 years (range: 16-39 years). Common lesion locations included lung (11 lesions; 28.2%), non-spinal bone (nine lesions; 23.1%), and spine (six lesions; 15.4%). The median biological effective dose (BED<sub>10</sub>) was 61.5 Gy (range: 26.4-180). One-year LC and OS following SABR were 77.7% (95% CI: 58.5-88.7) and 72.7% (95% CI: 46.3-87.6), respectively. On UVA, BED<sub>10</sub> ≥ 60 Gy was associated with superior one-year LC (94.4% vs. 47.6%; p<0.0001) as were sarcoma primaries (two-year LC: 92.3% vs. 42.2%;p = 0.0002). Central nervous system (CNS) primaries had significantly poorer one-year LC (20% vs 87.5%; p<0.0001) as well as spinal metastases (33.3% vs. 87.0%; p<0.0001). On MVA, BED<sub>10</sub> < 60 Gy was associated with inferior LC (hazard ratio (HR) = 5.51;p = 0.01) with sarcoma primaries associated with superior LC (HR = 0.04;p = 0.008). SABR with BED<sub>10</sub> ≥ 60 Gy resulted in durable LC for AYA patients, particularly those with sarcoma primaries, though poor outcomes were noted in metastatic CNS malignancies."

    "title": "Hyperactive mTORC1 in striatum dysregulates dopamine receptor expression and odor preference behavior.",
    "abstract": "Mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) plays an important role in brain development and synaptic plasticity. Dysregulation of the mTOR pathway is observed in various human central nervous system diseases, including tuberous sclerosis complex, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease. Numerous studies focused on the effects of hyperactivation of mTOR on cortical excitatory neurons, while only a few studies focused on inhibitory neurons. Here we generated transgenic mice in which mTORC1 signaling is hyperactivated in inhibitory neurons in the striatum, while cortical neurons left unaffected. The hyperactivation of mTORC1 signaling increased GABAergic inhibitory neurons in the striatum. The transgenic mice exhibited the upregulation of dopamine receptor D1 and the downregulation of dopamine receptor D2 in medium spiny neurons in the ventral striatum. Finally, the transgenic mice demonstrated impaired motor learning and dysregulated olfactory preference behavior, though the basic function of olfaction was preserved. These findings reveal that the mTORC1 signaling pathway plays an essential role in the development and function of the striatal inhibitory neurons and suggest the critical involvement of the mTORC1 pathway in the locomotor abnormalities in neurodegenerative diseases and the sensory defects in ASD."
