    "title": "Secondary accumulation of lyso-platelet activating factors in lysosomal storage diseases.",
    "abstract": "Lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) are a group of inherited disorders caused by defects in genes that encode lysosomal enzymes, transmembrane proteins, or transport proteins. These defects typically lead to the accumulation of undegraded substrates or obstructed substances in lysosomes, serving as primary storage materials. However, in certain LSDs, secondary storage products-such as glycosphingolipids, phospholipids, and cholesterol-can also accumulate in tissues, independent of the primary enzyme or protein defect. In our recent studies, we identified lyso-platelet activating factors (lyso-PAFs) as secondary storage compounds in multiple LSDs, including Niemann-Pick disease type C1 (NPC1), GM2 activator deficiency, and GM1 gangliosidosis (GM1). Our ongoing work suggests that lyso-PAFs are also prevalent secondary storage products in Niemann-Pick disease type A (NPA), Sandhoff disease (SD), Tay-Sachs disease (TSD), and Krabbe disease (KD). We observed that elevated lyso-PAF levels were significantly correlated with the accumulation of primary storage substances in these disorders, indicating their potential as biomarkers for disease progression in these LSDs. Moreover, treatment with adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based gene therapies led to a reduction in lyso-PAF levels in the central nervous systems of TSD sheep and GM1 cats, further supporting their potential as biomarkers for therapeutic efficacy. While it remains unclear whether changes in lyso-PAFs contribute directly to disease pathology or simply reflect disease progression, further research into the enzymes involved in their synthesis and degradation is essential for uncovering their functional role in the cellular physiology and pathology of LSDs. Thus, further exploration of lyso-PAF in biofluids as prognostic and pharmacodynamic biomarkers is warranted."

    "title": "CNS-targeted base editing of the major late-onset Tay-Sachs mutation alleviates disease in mice.",
    "abstract": "Late-onset Tay-Sachs (LOTS) disease is a lysosomal storage disorder most commonly caused by a point mutation (c.805G>A) in the HEXA gene encoding the α-subunit of the lysosomal enzyme β-hexosaminidase A. LOTS manifests as a range of gradually worsening neurological symptoms beginning in young adulthood. Here, we explored the efficacy of an adenine base editor (ABE) programmed with a small guide RNA (sgRNA) to correct the HEXA c.805G>A mutation. Base editing in LOTS patient fibroblasts successfully converted the pathogenic HEXA c.805A to G and partially restored β-hexosaminidase activity, with minimal genome-wide off-target editing. We generated a LOTS mouse model in which the mice exhibited decreased β-hexosaminidase activity, accumulation of GM2 ganglioside in the brain, progressive neurological manifestations, and reduced lifespan. Treatment of LOTS mice with the neurotropic virus AAV-PHP.eB carrying the ABE and an sgRNA targeting the LOTS point mutation partially corrected the c.805G>A mutation in the CNS, significantly increased brain β-hexosaminidase activity, and substantially reduced GM2 ganglioside accumulation in the brain. Moreover, the therapy delayed symptom onset and significantly extended median lifespan. These findings highlight the potential of base editing as an effective treatment for LOTS and its broader applicability to other lysosomal storage disorders."

    "title": "Evaluation of the PP6D5 Polymer as a Novel Non-Viral Vector in the Development of a CRISPR/nCas9-Based Gene Therapy for Tay-Sachs Disease.",
    "abstract": "<b>Background/Objectives:</b> Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by a deficiency in β-hexosaminidase A (HexA), which accumulates GM2 gangliosides, primarily in neurons. Currently, therapeutic options are limited, highlighting the need for new strategies such as gene therapy. Despite their effectiveness, viral vectors can elicit adverse immune responses; consequently, non-viral vectors are being explored as an alternative. We have previously investigated the use of CRISPR/Cas9 nickase (nCas9) as a potential tool for treating TSD. Here, we expanded our study by evaluating the PP6D5 polymer as a novel non-viral vector for delivering the CRISPR/nCas9 system to restore HexA activity. <b>Methods:</b> First, we evaluated the PP6D5-mediated CRISPR/nCas9 system's transfection efficiency in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts, U87MG astrocytoma, SHSY5Y neuroblastoma, and TSD fibroblasts. We then evaluated the potential of PP6D5 to correct the gene defect in TSD fibroblasts. <b>Results:</b> The results showed that PP6D5 exhibited significantly higher transfection efficiency compared to lipofectamine 3000 in all tested cell models. In TSD fibroblasts, transfection with both HEXA and HEXB cDNAs increased the HexA activity levels by up to 7.4-fold, compared to a 3.2-fold increase in cells transfected only with HEXA cDNA after 15 days post-transfection. These levels were up to 4.5-fold higher than those observed in lipofectamine-mediated transfection. Additionally, PP6D5-mediated CRISPR/nCas9-based genome editing led to a significant reduction in the lysosomal mass of TSD fibroblasts. <b>Conclusions:</b> This study provides promising evidence for the use of the PP6D5 polymer as a non-viral vector for delivering CRISPR/nCas9-based gene therapy in TSD. The use of the PP6D5 polymer may offer some advantages that viral vectors cannot, such as a reduction in cytotoxicity and higher TE in difficult-to-transfect cell lines. Furthermore, this type of polymeric vector has not been extensively explored for gene therapy, making this study an important contribution to the development of non-viral delivery systems for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases."

    "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder characterized by the accumulation of GM2 ganglioside due to mutations in the <i>HEXA</i> gene, which encodes the α-subunit of β-Hexosaminidase A. This accumulation leads to significant neuropathological effects and premature death in affected individuals. No effective treatments exist, but enzyme replacement therapies are under investigation. In our previous work, we demonstrated the internalization and efficacy of human recombinant lysosomal β-hexosaminidase A (rhHex-A), produced in the methylotrophic yeast <i>Pichia pastoris</i>, in reducing lipids and lysosomal mass levels in fibroblasts and neural stem cells derived from patient-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). In this study, we further evaluated the potential of rhHex-A to prevent GM2 accumulation using fibroblast and neuroglia cells from a TSD patient alongside a relevant mouse model. <b>Methods:</b> Fibroblasts and neuroglial cell lines derived from a murine model and TSD patients were treated with 100 nM rhHexA for 72 h. After treatment, cells were stained by anti-GM2 (targeting GM2 ganglioside; KM966) and anti-LAMP1 (lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1) colocalization staining and incubated with 50 nM LysoTracker Red DND-99 to label lysosomes. In addition, <i>GM2AP</i> and <i>HEXB</i> expression were analyzed to assess whether rhHex-A treatment affected the levels of enzymes involved in GM2 ganglioside degradation. <b>Results:</b> Immunofluorescence staining for LysoTracker and colocalization studies of GM2 and Lamp1 indicated reduced lysosomal mass and GM2 levels. Notably, rhHex-A treatment also affected the expression of the <i>HEXB</i> gene, which is involved in GM2 ganglioside metabolism, highlighting a potential regulatory interaction within the metabolic pathway. <b>Conclusions:</b> Here, we report that rhHex-A produced in yeast can efficiently degrade GM2 ganglioside and rescue lysosomal accumulation in TSD cells."

    "abstract": "GM2 activator deficiency (AB variant of GM2 gangliosidosis) is an ultra-rare autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder caused by pathogenic GM2A mutations. The loss of a functional GM2 activator protein disrupts GM2 ganglioside degradation, leading to progressive neurodegeneration. Although it shares clinical features with Tay-Sachs disease, GM2 activator deficiency remains a genetically and biochemically distinct disorder, with limited genotype-phenotype correlation due to the small number of reported cases. This report presents a 33-month-old male with an infantile-onset phenotype, characterized by nystagmus, axial hypotonia, hyperacusis, and bilateral cherry-red spots. Genetic analysis identified a homozygous likely pathogenic c.262_264del (p.Lys88del) mutation, reinforcing its potential association with early disease onset. His clinical course was marked by progressive neurodegeneration, recurrent pulmonary infections, and severe feeding difficulties requiring gastrostomy placement. In addition, previously published cases were reviewed to provide insights into the phenotypic spectrum, age of onset, and key clinical characteristics of GM2 activator deficiency. Among the 22 reported cases, 77.3 % exhibited an infantile-onset phenotype, while 18.2 % and 4.5 % had juvenile and adult-onset forms, respectively. Notably, cherry-red spots and hyperacusis were present in 94.1 % and 82.4 % of infantile cases but were strikingly absent in later-onset phenotypes. This case report, supplemented by a literature review, offers a comprehensive overview of GM2 activator deficiency and underscores the importance of early molecular diagnosis in suspected cases."

    "abstract": "Late-onset Tay-Sachs (LOTS) disease and late-onset Sandhoff disease (LOSD) have long been considered indistinguishable due to similar clinical presentations and shared biochemical deficits. However, recent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have shown distinct cerebellar atrophy associated with LOTS. In this study, we furthered this investigation to determine if the cerebellar atrophy is globally uniform or preferentially targets certain cerebellar regions. We utilized <i>DeepCERES</i>, a deep learning cerebellar specific segmentation and cortical thickness pipeline to analyze differences between LOTS (n=20), LOSD (n=5), and neurotypical controls (n=1038). LOTS had smaller volumes of the whole cerebellum as well as cerebellar lobules IV, V, VI, VIIB, VIIIA, VIIIB, IX, and both Crus I and II compared to both LOSD and neurotypical controls. LOTS patients also had smaller cortical thickness of cerebellar lobules V, VI, VIIB, VIIIA, VIIIB, and both Crus I and II compared to both LOSD and neurotypical controls. Cerebellar functional and lesion localization studies have implicated lobules V and VI in speech articulation and execution while lobules VI, Crus I, VIIA, among others, have been implicated in a variety of behaviors and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Our observations provide a possible anatomical substrate to the higher prevalence of dysarthria and psychosis in our LOTS but not LOSD patients. Future studies are needed for direct comparisons considering phenotypic aspects such as age of symptom onset, presence and severity of dysarthria and ataxia, full characterization of neuropsychiatric profiles, molecular pathology and biochemical differences to fully understand the dichotomy observed in these two diseases."

Tay-Sachs disease is caused by variants in HEXA encoding the α-subunit and Sandhoff disease is caused by variants in HEXB encoding the β-subunit. Due to shared clinical and biochemical findings, the two have been considered indistinguishable. We applied T1-weighted volumetric analysis, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and correlational fiber tractography to assess phenotypic differences in these two diseases. 51 T1-weighted and 40 DTI scans from 19 Late-Onset GM2 patients with either late-onset Sandhoff disease (LOSD), or late-onset Tay-Sachs (LOTS) were included and compared to 1033 neurotypical control volumetric MRI scans. LOTS patients had significantly smaller cerebellum volume compared to neurotypical controls (p < 0.0001) and LOSD patients (p < 0.0001). There was no statistical difference for the volume of any structure between LOSD and neurotypical controls. DTI analysis showed LOTS patients had higher mean diffusivity (MD) in the left cerebellum (p = 0.003703), right cerebellum (p = 0.003435), superior cerebellar peduncle (p = 0.007332), and vermis (p = 0.01007) compared to LOSD. LOTS patients had lower fractional anisotropy (FA) in the left cerebellum (p = 0.005537), right cerebellum (p = 0.01905), SCP (p = 0.02844), and vermis (p = 0.02469) when compared to LOSD. Correlational fiber tractography identified fiber tracts in cerebellar pathways with higher FA and lower MD in LOSD patients compared to LOTS patients. Our study shows neurobiologic differences between these two related disorders. To our knowledge, this is the first study using correlational tractography in a lysosomal storage disorder. This result indicates a greater burden of cerebellar pathology in LOTS patients compared with LOSD patients."

Notably, a number of genes that cause sphingolipidoses are also risk genes for Lewy body diseases, suggesting aetiological links between these distinct disorders. In the present review, we discuss the sphingolipidoses in which α-synuclein pathology has been reported: Gaucher disease, Krabbe disease, metachromatic leukodystrophy, Tay-Sachs disease and Anderson-Fabry disease, and describe the characteristic clinical and pathological features of these disorders, in addition to the evidence suggesting α-synuclein pathology occurs in these disorders. Finally, we evaluate the pathological mechanisms that underlie these rare disorders, with particular attention to how the enzymatic deficiency, substrate accumulation, or both, could contribute to the genesis of α-synuclein pathology and the implications of this for Lewy body diseases."

    "abstract": "Lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) are a group of rare genetic conditions characterized by the impaired function of enzymes responsible for lipid digestion. Among these LSDs, Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) and Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) may share a common gene expression profile. In this study, we conducted a bioinformatics analysis to explore the gene expression profile overlap between TSD and NPC. Analyses were performed on RNA-seq datasets for both TSD and NPC from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Datasets were subjected to differential gene expression analysis utilizing the DESeq2 package in the R programming language. A total of 147 differentially expressed genes (DEG) were found to be shared between the TSD and NPC datasets. Enrichment analysis was then performed on the DEGs. We found that the common DEGs are predominantly associated with processes such as cell adhesion mediated by integrin, cell-substrate adhesion, and urogenital system development. Furthermore, construction of protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks using the Cytoscape software led to the identification of four hub genes: APOE, CD44, SNCA, and ITGB5. Those hub genes not only can unravel the pathogenesis of related neurologic diseases with common impaired pathways, but also may pave the way towards targeted gene therapy of LSDs.In addition, they serve as the potential biomarkers for related neurodegenerative diseases warranting further investigations."

Our group recently generated Hexa-/-Neu3-/- mice, a murine model with neuropathological abnormalities similar to the infantile form of Tay-Sachs disease. Previously, we reported progressive neurodegeneration with neuronal loss in the brain sections of Hexa-/-Neu3-/- mice. However, the relationship between the severity of neurodegeneration and the imbalance in redox homeostasis was not yet clarified in Hexa-/-Neu3-/- mice. Here, we evaluated whether neurodegeneration is associated with oxidative stress in the tissues and cells of Hexa-/-Neu3-/- mice and neuroglia cells from Tay-Sachs patients. Cell death and oxidative stress-related markers were evaluated in four brain regions and fibroblasts of 5-month-old WT, Hexa-/-, Neu3-/-, and Hexa-/-Neu3-/- mice and human neuroglia cells using Western blot, RT-PCR, and immunohistochemistry analyses. We further analyzed oxidative stress levels in the samples using flow cytometry analyses. We discovered neuronal death, alterations in intracellular ROS levels, and damaging effects of oxidative stress, especially in the cerebellum and fibroblasts of Hexa-/-Neu3-/- mice. Our results showed that alteration in redox homeostasis might be related to neurodegeneration in the murine model of Tay-Sachs Disease. These findings suggest that targeting the altered redox balance and increased oxidative stress might be a rational therapeutic approach for alleviating neurodegeneration and treating Tay-Sachs disease."

    "abstract": "Tay-Sachs disease is a rare lysosomal storage disorder caused by β-Hexosaminidase A enzyme deficiency causing abnormal GM2 ganglioside accumulation in the central nervous system. GM2 accumulation triggers chronic neuroinflammation due to neurodegeneration-based astrogliosis and macrophage activity with the increased expression level of Ccl2 in the cortex of a recently generated Tay-Sachs disease mouse model Hexa-/-Neu3-/-. Propagermanium blocks the neuroinflammatory response induced by Ccl2, which is highly expressed in astrocytes and microglia. The ketogenic diet has broad potential usage in neurological disorders, but the knowledge of the impact on Tay-Sach disease is limited. This study aimed to display the effect of combining the ketogenic diet and propagermanium treatment on chronic neuroinflammation in the Tay-Sachs disease mouse model. Hexa-/-Neu3-/- mice were placed into the following groups: (i) standard diet, (ii) ketogenic diet, (iii) standard diet with propagermanium, and (iv) ketogenic diet with propagermanium. RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry analyzed neuroinflammation markers. Behavioral analyses were also applied to assess phenotypic improvement. Notably, the expression levels of neuroinflammation-related genes were reduced in the cortex of 140-day-old Hexa-/-Neu3-/- mice compared to β-Hexosaminidase A deficient mice (Hexa-/-) after combined treatment. Immunohistochemical analysis displayed correlated results with the RT-PCR. Our data suggest the potential to implement combined treatment to reduce chronic inflammation in Tay-Sachs and other lysosomal storage diseases."

Cerebellar atrophy is common, even in the absence of clinical ataxia, particularly in LOTS. Recent reports have also described brainstem atrophy in LOTS. We assessed brainstem substructure atrophy in LOGG, including LOSD. 10 LOGG patients (7 LOTS, 3 LOSD) and 7 age-matched controls had structural MRI brain imaging. A FreeSurfer brainstem substructure module was used for automatic segmentation and included the pons, medulla, superior cerebellar peduncle (SCP), midbrain, and total brainstem. Clinical ataxia severity was assessed with the LOTS Severity Scale, Brief Ataxia Rating Scale, Friedreich's Ataxia Rating Scale and Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia. There were differences between LOGG and controls in the pons (12,785.06 ± 1,603.84 vs. 15,457.14 ± 2,748.41 mm<sup>3</sup>, p = 0.0069) and SCP (196.93 ± 31.20 vs. 293.57 ± .70.16 mm<sup>3</sup>, p = 0.0003). In LOTS vs. controls, there was similar pons (p = 0.0055) and SCP atrophy (p = 0.0023). The LOSD group was too small for independent comparisons. There were no significant associations between SCP/pons volume and clinical scales or disease duration. Cerebellar volume, which was analyzed in a previous study by Rowe et al. (2021), was relatively preserved in LOSD compared to the SCP/pons, while in LOTS, the pontocerebellar atrophy profile was dominated by cerebellar atrophy. These findings provide anatomical and clinical insights to the cerebellar/brainstem atrophy observed in LOGG and highlight a need to stratify LOGG by subtypes."

Despite the liver being the hub of lipid metabolism, lipid metabolism occurs across the human body. Any perturbation in the lipid metabolism or lipid storage systems can lead to diseases or disorders that can hamper the normal functioning of the human body. Lipids have been explored for their role in cancers. The intake of saturated fatty acids has been found to increase the metastasis and growth of cancerous cells. The role of lipids has also been studied in brain diseases. In Tay-Sachs disease, the inability to metabolize GM2 ganglioside alters normal nerve cell functioning. Similarly, lipids also play critical roles in Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease. Moreover, atherosclerosis is a leading cause of cardiovascular diseases and brain stroke. Dyslipidemia or excess fatty acids is a leading cause of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, insulin resistance, and diabetes mellitus. Dyslipidemia also leads to jaundice, which, in turn, can seriously damage the kidneys. This review focuses on the various human diseases occurring because of lipid metabolism."

Lysosomal storage of GM2 triggers inflammation in the CNS and periphery. The NLRP3 inflammasome is an important coordinator of pro-inflammatory responses, and we have investigated its regulation in murine SD. The NLRP3 inflammasome requires two signals, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and ATP, to prime and activate the complex, respectively, leading to IL-1β secretion. Peritoneal, but not bone-marrow-derived, macrophages from symptomatic SD mice, but not those from pre-symptomatic animals, secrete the cytokine following priming with LPS with no requirement for activation with ATP, suggesting that such NLRP3 deregulation is related to the extent of glycosphingolipid storage. Dysregulated production of IL-1β was dependent upon caspase activity but not cathepsin B. We investigated the role of IL-1β in SD pathology using two approaches: the creation of <i>hexb</i><sup>-/-</sup><i>Il1r1</i><sup>-/-</sup> double knockout mice or by treating <i>hexb</i><sup>-/-</sup> animals with anakinra, a recombinant form of the IL-1 receptor antagonist, IL-1Ra. Both resulted in modest but significant extensions in lifespan and improvement of neurological function. These data demonstrate that IL-1β actively participates in the disease process and provides proof-of-principle that blockade of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β may provide benefits to patients."

    "abstract": "Tay-Sachs disease is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder caused by <i>HEXA</i> mutations inactivating the metabolic enzyme HexA. The most common mutation is c.1278insTATC, a tandem 4-bp duplication disrupting <i>HEXA</i> expression by frameshift. In an engineered cell model, we explore the use of CRISPR-Cas9 for therapeutic editing of c.1278insTATC. Within genomic microduplications, the microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ) pathway is favored to repair double-stranded breaks with collateral deletion of one repeat. Protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) constraints on Cas9 endonuclease activity prevented cleavage at the duplication center, the optimal position for MMEJ initiation. Rather, cleavage 1 bp from the c.1278insTATC duplication center spontaneously reconstructed the wild-type sequence at ∼14.7% frequency, with concomitant restoration of normal cellular HexA activity. As an alternative to perfect correction, short insertions or deletions were serially introduced to restore an open reading frame across a 19-bp sequence encompassing c.1278insTATC. Frame-restored variants did not recover significant HexA function, presumably due to structural incompatibility of incurred amino acid insertions. Hence, precise correction of c.1278insTATC is the only therapeutically relevant outcome achieved in this study, with MMEJ highlighted as a potential template-free CRISPR-Cas9 modality to that end."

In the Sandhoff disease mouse model, rescue potential was severely reduced when HexA was introduced after disease onset. Here, we assess the effect of recombinant HexA and HexD3, a newly engineered mimetic of HexA optimized for the treatment of Tay-Sachs disease and Sandhoff disease. Enzyme replacement therapy was administered by repeat intracerebroventricular injections in Sandhoff disease model mice with dosing beginning before and after signs of neurodegeneration. As previously observed, HexA effectively increased the lifespan of Sandhoff disease mice by 3.5-fold only when treatment was started before onset of neurodegeneration. In contrast, HexD3 halted motor decline and ameliorated late-stage disease severity even when dosing began late, after neurodegeneration onset. Additionally, HexD3 had advantages over HexA in enzyme stability, distribution potential, and homodimer activity. Overall, our data indicate that advanced therapeutics may widen the treatment window for neurodegenerative disorders."

The GM2A deficient cat has clinical features consistent with the human condition, including isointensity of gray and white matter of the brain on T2-weighted MRI; MR spectroscopic changes of brain metabolites consistent with gliosis, neuronal injury and demyelination; rhythmical slowing of cerebral cortical activation on electroencephalography; and elevation of aspartate aminotransferase and lactate dehydrogenase in cerebrospinal fluid. Biochemically, the brain of GM2A deficient cats has storage of GM2 and GA2 ganglioside coincident with increased hexosaminidase activity toward a standard synthetic substrate. Also, the brain of GM2A deficient cats has increased levels of lyso-platelet activating factor and lyso-phosphatidylcholine, which may serve as novel biomarkers of disease progression and provide insights into pathogenic mechanisms."

    "title": "Beyond the traditional distinctions of genome editing: evaluating a vulnerability framework.",
    "abstract": "Over 40 years ago, the 1982 Splicing Life report outlined the two distinctions that have orientated much of the normative and legal landscape of genetic intervention or genome editing since - that of somatic versus germline (or heritable interventions) and medical versus non-medical (or enhancement) applications. During this time, these distinctions have been used to ethically prioritize some areas of research and potential application, such as somatic treatments, while considering others for prohibition, such as germline enhancements. Nevertheless, somatic interventions may also be done for controversial enhancement purposes while some germline interventions may be done with greater <i>prima facie</i> justification (e.g., the enhancement of athletic ability versus the avoidance of Tay-Sachs disease). Even with new somatic treatments that are generally lauded, exemplified with the case of Casgevy, many issues still arise - such as cost and access, particularly salient on a global level. The concerns over a dystopian future of genetic haves and have nots, as a result of enhancement and/or germline interventions, that perhaps may happen, should not distract us from a greater attention to what is happening in the here and now. In this paper, we will highlight the limits of the two distinctions in terms of moving from questions of \"should a technology be used\" to \"how should a technology be used.\" We argue that an additional focus on vulnerability and marginalization can be useful to support the attempt to better prioritize which interventions should be permitted or prohibited. We show how this can better dovetail with calls for effective (global) governance and reasonable consensus by focusing on the most urgent issues and developing policy accordingly, while leaving aside more abstract issues for further discussion."

    "title": "4-Phenylbutyric acid mitigates ER stress-induced neurodegeneration in the spinal cords of a GM2 gangliosidosis mouse model.",
    "abstract": "Sandhoff disease (SD), a fatal and rare lysosomal storage disorder (LSD), is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme β-hexosaminidase B and leads to severe accumulation of GM2 gangliosides in lysosomes, primarily within the central nervous system (CNS). This accumulation results in severe neurological impairment, lower motor neuron disease, and death. Currently, there are no effective therapies available for SD. Here, we explored the role of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in the spinal cord during disease progression in an established mouse model of SD and revealed the beneficial outcome of off-label treatment with the FDA-approved drug, 4-phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA). We analyzed the expression and localization of ER stress and cellular apoptosis markers, which revealed significant upregulation of these factors within motor neurons. Additionally, we observed a > 50% reduction in neuronal numbers throughout all spinal cord regions. Our studies also tested the impact of the chemical chaperone 4-PBA on ER stress in mice, and following administration, we observed significant improvements in motor neuromuscular function and life span throughout disease progression. 4-PBA treatment significantly reduced apoptosis in spinal cord neurons and increased the number of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)-positive neurons, with little effect on astrogliosis or sensory interneurons. Overall, this study provides strong evidence for the role of chronic ER stress in the pathophysiology of SD and highlights 4-PBA as a promising therapeutic treatment for SD and potentially other related LSDs."

    "abstract": "Tay-Sachs Disease is a rare lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations in the HEXA gene, responsible for the degradation of ganglioside GM2. In addition to progressive neurodegeneration, Tay-Sachs patients display bone anomalies, including kyphosis. Tay-Sachs disease mouse model (Hexa-/-Neu3-/-) shows both neuropathological and clinical abnormalities of the infantile-onset disease phenotype. In this study, we investigated the effects of GM2 accumulation on bone remodeling activity. Here, we evaluated the bone phenotype of 5-month-old Hexa-/-Neu3-/- mice with age-matched control groups using gene expression analysis, bone plasma biomarker analysis, and micro-computed tomography. We demonstrated lower plasma alkaline phosphatase activity and calcium levels with increased tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase levels, indicating reduced bone remodeling activity in mice. Consistently, gene expression analysis confirmed osteoblast reduction and osteoclast induction in the femur of mice. Micro-computed tomography and analysis show reduced trabecular bone volume, mineral density, number, and thickness in Hexa-/-Neu3-/- mice. In conclusion, we demonstrated that abnormal GM2 ganglioside accumulation significantly triggers skeletal abnormality in Tay-Sachs mice. We suggest that further investigation of the molecular basis of bone structure anomalies is necessary to elucidate new therapeutic targets that prevent the progression of bone symptoms and improve the life standards of Tay-Sachs patients. KEY MESSAGES: We detected the markers of bone loss-associated disorders such as osteopenia and osteoporosis in the Tay-Sachs disease mice model Hexa-/-Neu3-/-. We also demonstrated for the first time there is an increase in trabecular spacing and a reduction in trabecular thickness and number indicating skeletal abnormalities in mice model using micro-CT analysis."

    "abstract": "Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) is a rare genetic disorder with diverse clinical manifestations, often leading to underdiagnosis due to symptom similarities with other neurological conditions. In this study, we aimed to identify the genetic mutations underlying late-onset TSD in a 27-year-old patient with progressive neurological symptoms. Whole-exome sequencing revealed two <i>hexA</i> gene mutations associated with TSD: a previously known variant, c.805G > A (p.Gly269Ser), and a novel splice-site mutation, c.346 + 2dupT. Through clinical assessments, genetic analysis, and functional investigations-including RNA sequencing and enzymatic activity assays-we confirmed the pathogenicity of the novel mutation. Our findings highlight the efficacy of advanced genomic technologies in diagnosing intricate genetic disorders and emphasize the significance of functional validation to confirm the effects of mutations. Identifying compound heterozygous mutations in the <i>hexA</i> gene also provides insight into Mendelian inheritance patterns. This case highlights the diagnostic challenges posed by overlapping clinical phenotypes and emphasizes the need for increased genetic awareness among clinicians. Accurate diagnosis of TSD has significant implications for patients and their families, allowing for informed genetic counseling and guiding clinical management decisions. While current treatment options are limited, timely and accurate diagnosis holds promise for future research and therapeutic interventions. This study highlights the value of a multidisciplinary approach in exploring the molecular basis of complex genetic diseases and informing clinical decisions."

    "abstract": "Genetic diagnosis plays a crucial role in rare diseases, particularly with the increasing availability of emerging and accessible treatments. The International Rare Diseases Research Consortium (IRDiRC) has set its primary goal as: \"Ensuring that all patients who present with a suspected rare disease receive a diagnosis within one year if their disorder is documented in the medical literature\". Despite significant advances in genomic sequencing technologies, more than half of the patients with suspected Mendelian disorders remain undiagnosed. In response, IRDiRC proposes the establishment of \"a globally coordinated diagnostic and research pipeline\". To help facilitate this, IRDiRC formed the Task Force on Integrating New Technologies for Rare Disease Diagnosis. This multi-stakeholder Task Force aims to provide an overview of the current state of innovative diagnostic technologies for clinicians and researchers, focusing on the patient's diagnostic journey. Herein, we provide an overview of a broad spectrum of emerging diagnostic technologies involving genomics, epigenomics and multi-omics, functional testing and model systems, data sharing, bioinformatics, and Artificial Intelligence (AI), highlighting their advantages, limitations, and the current state of clinical adaption. We provide expert recommendations outlining the stepwise application of these innovative technologies in the diagnostic pathways while considering global differences in accessibility. The importance of FAIR (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability) and CARE (Collective benefit, Authority to control, Responsibility, and Ethics) data management is emphasized, along with the need for enhanced and continuing education in medical genomics. We provide a perspective on future technological developments in genome diagnostics and their integration into clinical practice. Lastly, we summarize the challenges related to genomic diversity and accessibility, highlighting the significance of innovative diagnostic technologies, global collaboration, and equitable access to diagnosis and treatment for people living with rare disease."

    "abstract": "To evaluate the reliability, responsiveness, and validity of the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) in patients with lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) who present with neurological symptoms, and quantify the threshold for a clinically meaningful change. We analyzed data from three clinical trial cohorts (IB1001-201, IB1001-202, and IB1001-301) of patients with Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) and GM2 Gangliosidoses (Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff disease) comprising 122 patients and 703 visits. Reproducibility was described as re-test reliability between repeat baseline visits or baseline and post-treatment washout visits. Responsiveness was determined in relation to the Investigator's, Caregiver's, and Patient's Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI-I). The CGI-I data was also used to quantify a threshold for a clinically meaningful improvement on the SARA scale. Using a qualitative methods approach, patient/caregiver interviews from the IB1001-301 trial were further used to assess a threshold of meaningful change as well as the breadth of neurological signs and symptoms captured and evaluated by the SARA scale. The Inter-Class Correlation (ICC) was 0.95 or greater for all three trials, indicating a high internal consistency/reliability. The mean change in SARA between repeat baseline and post-treatment washout visit assessments in all trials was -0.05, SD 1.98, i.e., minimal, indicating no significant differences, learning effects or other systematic biases. For the CGI-I responses and change in SARA scores, Area Under the Curve (AUC) values were 0.82, 0.71, and 0.77 for the Investigator's, Caregiver's, and Patient's CGI-I respectively, indicating strong agreement. Further qualitative analyses of the patient/caregiver interviews demonstrated a 1-point or greater change on SARA to be a clinically meaningful improvement which is directly relevant to the patient's everyday functioning and quality of life. Changes captured by the SARA were also paralleled by improvement in a broad range of neurological signs and symptoms and beyond cerebellar ataxia. Qualitative and quantitative data demonstrate the reliability and responsiveness of the SARA score as a valid measure of neurological signs and symptoms in LSDs with CNS involvement, such as NPC and GM2 Gangliosidoses. A 1-point change represents a clinically meaningful transition reflecting the gain or loss of complex function."

    "abstract": "Adeno-associated virus (AAV) mediated gene therapy is a leading gene delivery platform with potential to transform the landscape of treatment for neurological disorders. While AAV is deemed non-immunogenic compared to other viral vectors, adverse immune reactions have been observed in the clinic, raising concerns. As the central nervous system (CNS) has a tightly regulated immune system, characterized by a degree of tolerance, it has been considered a unique target for AAV gene therapy. AAV vectors have shown promising results for the treatment of several CNS disorders including Spinal Muscular Atrophy, Giant Axonal Neuropathy, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, Tay Sachs Disease, Parkinson's Disease, and others, demonstrating safety and success. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of Zolgensma and European Medicines Agency (EMA) approval of Upstaza, for Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) and Aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase deficiency (AADC) respectively, represent this success, all while highlighting significant differences in immune responses to AAV, particularly with regards to therapeutic administration route. AAV therapies like Upstaza that are injected directly into the immune-specialized brain have been characterized by mild immune response profiles and minor adverse events, whereas therapies like Zolgensma that are injected systemically demonstrate more robust immune stimulation and off-target toxicities. Despite these contrasting parallels, these therapeutics and others in the clinic have demonstrated clinical benefit for patients, warranting further exploration of immune responses to CNS-directed AAV clinical trials. Thus, in this review, we discuss effects of different routes of AAV administration on eliciting local and peripheral immune responses specifically observed in CNS-targeted trials."

    "abstract": "Rare disorders comprise of ~ 7500 different conditions affecting multiple systems. Diagnosis of rare diseases is complex due to dearth of specialized medical professionals, testing labs and limited therapeutic options. There is scarcity of data on the prevalence of rare diseases in different populations. India being home to a large population comprising of 4600 population groups, of which several thousand are endogamous, is likely to have a high burden of rare diseases. The present study provides a retrospective overview of a cohort of patients with rare genetic diseases identified at a tertiary genetic test centre in India. Overall, 3294 patients with 305 rare diseases were identified in the present study cohort. These were categorized into 14 disease groups based on the major organ/ organ system affected. Highest number of rare diseases (D = 149/305, 48.9%) were identified in the neuromuscular and neurodevelopmental (NMND) group followed by inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) (D = 47/305; 15.4%). Majority patients in the present cohort (N = 1992, 61%) were diagnosed under IEM group, of which Gaucher disease constituted maximum cases (N = 224, 11.2%). Under the NMND group, Duchenne muscular dystrophy (N = 291/885, 32.9%), trinucleotide repeat expansion disorders (N = 242/885; 27.3%) and spinal muscular atrophy (N = 141/885, 15.9%) were the most common. Majority cases of β-thalassemia (N = 120/149, 80.5%) and cystic fibrosis (N = 74/75, 98.7%) under the haematological and pulmonary groups were observed, respectively. Founder variants were identified for Tay-Sachs disease and mucopolysaccharidosis IVA diseases. Recurrent variants for Gaucher disease (GBA:c.1448T > C), β-thalassemia (HBB:c.92.+5G > C), non-syndromic hearing loss (GJB2:c.71G > A), albinism (TYR:c.832 C > T), congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CYP21A2:c.29-13 C > G) and progressive pseudo rheumatoid dysplasia (CCN6:c.298T > A) were observed in the present study. The present retrospective study of rare disease patients diagnosed at a tertiary genetic test centre provides first insight into the distribution of rare genetic diseases across the country. This information will likely aid in drafting future health policies, including newborn screening programs, development of target specific panel for affordable diagnosis of rare diseases and eventually build a platform for devising novel treatment strategies for rare diseases."

Methods for screening and diagnosis of TSD and SD include measurement and comparison of the activity of these two enzymes. Here we report a novel method for duplex screening of dried blood spots (DBS) for TSD and SD by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The method requires incubation of a single 3 mm DBS punch with the assay cocktail followed by the injection into the LC-MS/MS. The performance of the method was evaluated by comparing the confirmed TSD and SD patient DBS to random healthy newborn DBS which showed easy discrimination between the three cohorts. The method is multiplexable with other LSD MS/MS enzyme assays which is critical to the continued expansion of the NBS panels."

    "abstract": "The late-onset GM2 gangliosidoses, comprising late-onset Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff diseases, are rare, slowly progressive, neurogenetic disorders primarily characterized by neurogenic weakness, ataxia, and dysarthria. The aim of this longitudinal study was to characterize the natural history of late-onset GM2 gangliosidoses using a number of clinical outcome assessments to measure different aspects of disease burden and progression over time, including neurological, functional, and quality of life, to inform the design of future clinical interventional trials. Patients attending the United States National Tay-Sachs & Allied Diseases Family Conference between 2015 and 2019 underwent annual clinical outcome assessments. Currently, there are no clinical outcome assessments validated to assess late-onset GM2 gangliosidoses; therefore, instruments used or designed for diseases with similar features, or to address various aspects of the clinical presentations, were used. Clinical outcome assessments included the Friedreich's Ataxia Rating Scale, the 9-Hole Peg Test, and the Assessment of Intelligibility of Dysarthric Speech. Twenty-three patients participated in at least one meeting visit (late-onset Tay-Sachs, n = 19; late-onset Sandhoff, n = 4). Patients had high disease burden at baseline, and scores for the different clinical outcome assessments were generally lower than would be expected for the general population. Longitudinal analyses showed slow, but statistically significant, neurological progression as evidenced by worsening scores on the 9-Hole Peg Test (2.68%/year, 95% CI: 0.13-5.29; p = 0.04) and the Friedreich's Ataxia Rating Scale neurological examination (1.31 points/year, 95% CI: 0.26-2.35; p = 0.02). Time since diagnosis to study entry correlated with worsening scores on the 9-Hole Peg Test (r = 0.728; p < 0.001), Friedreich's Ataxia Rating Scale neurological examination (r = 0.727; p < 0.001), and Assessment of Intelligibility of Dysarthric Speech intelligibility (r = -0.654; p = 0.001). In summary, patients with late-onset GM2 gangliosidoses had high disease burden and slow disease progression. Several clinical outcome assessments suitable for clinical trials showed only small changes and standardized effect sizes (change/standard deviation of change) over 4 years. These longitudinal natural history study results illustrate the challenge of identifying responsive endpoints for clinical trials in rare, slowly progressive, neurogenerative disorders where arguably the treatment goal is to halt or decrease the rate of decline rather than improve clinical status. Furthermore, powering such a study would require a large sample size and/or a long study duration, neither of which is an attractive option for an ultra-rare disease with no available treatment. These findings support the development of potentially more sensitive late-onset GM2 gangliosidoses-specific rating instruments and/or surrogate endpoints for use in future clinical trials."

    "abstract": "The mosquito-borne dengue virus remains a major public health concern in Malaysia. Despite various control efforts and measures introduced by the Malaysian Government to combat dengue, the increasing trend of dengue cases persists and shows no sign of decreasing. Currently, early detection and vector control are the main methods employed to curb dengue outbreaks. In this study, a coupled model consisting of the statistical ARIMAX model and the deterministic SI-SIR model was developed and validated using the weekly reported dengue data from year 2014 to 2019 for Selangor, Malaysia. Previous studies have shown that climate variables, especially temperature, humidity, and precipitation, were able to influence dengue incidence and transmission dynamics through their effect on the vector. In this coupled model, climate is linked to dengue disease through mosquito biting rate, allowing real-time forecast of dengue cases using climate variables, namely temperature, rainfall and humidity. For the period chosen for model validation, the coupled model can forecast 1-2 weeks in advance with an average error of less than 6%, three weeks in advance with an average error of 7.06% and four weeks in advance with an average error of 8.01%. Further model simulation analysis suggests that the coupled model generally provides better forecast than the stand-alone ARIMAX model, especially at the onset of the outbreak. Moreover, the coupled model is more robust in the sense that it can be further adapted for investigating the effectiveness of various dengue mitigation measures subject to the changing climate."

New gene therapies are on the horizon but will require early presymptomatic diagnosis to be fully effective. We therefore developed a fast and highly sensitive liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)-based method for quantification of N-acetylaspartate in dried blood spots and established reference ranges for neonates and older controls. With this test, we investigated 45 samples of 25 Canavan patients including 8 with a neonatal sample. Measuring N-acetylaspartate concentration in dried blood with this novel test, all Canavan patients (with variable severity) were well separated from the control group (median; range: 5.7; 1.6-13.6 μmol/L [n = 45] vs 0.44; 0.24-0.99 μmol/L [n = 59] (p < 0.05)). There was also no overlap when comparing neonatal samples of Canavan patients (7.3; 5.1-9.9 μmol/L [n = 8]) and neonatal controls (0.93; 0.4-1.8 μmol/L [n = 784]) (p < 0.05). We have developed a new LC-MS/MS-based screening test for early postnatal diagnosis of Canavan disease that should be further evaluated in a population-based study once a promising treatment becomes available. The method meets the general requirements of newborn screening and should be appropriate for multiplexing with other screening approaches that combine chromatographic and mass spectrometry techniques."

    "abstract": "Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) and its severe form Sandhoff disease (SD) are autosomal recessive lysosomal storage metabolic disorders, which often result into excessive GM2 ganglioside accumulation predominantly in lysosomes of nerve cells. Although patients with these diseases appear normal at birth, the progressive accumulation of undegraded GM2 gangliosides in neurons leads to early death accompanied by manifestation of motor difficulties and gradual loss of behavioral skills. Unfortunately, there is still no effective treatment available for TSD/SD. The present study highlights the importance of cinnamic acid (CA), a naturally occurring aromatic fatty acid present in a number of plants, in inhibiting the disease process in a transgenic mouse model of SD. Oral administration of CA significantly attenuated glial activation and inflammation and reduced the accumulation of GM2 gangliosides/glycoconjugates in the cerebral cortex of Sandhoff mice. Besides, oral CA also improved behavioral performance and increased the survival of Sandhoff mice. While assessing the mechanism, we found that oral administration of CA increased the level of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) in the brain of Sandhoff mice and that oral CA remained unable to reduce glycoconjugates, improve behavior and increase survival in Sandhoff mice lacking PPARα. Our results indicate a beneficial function of CA that utilizes a PPARα-dependent mechanism to halt the progression of SD and thereby increase the longevity of Sandhoff mice."

    "abstract": "Growing interest in therapeutic development for rare diseases necessitate a systematic approach to the collection and curation of natural history data that can be applied consistently across this group of heterogenous rare diseases. In this study, we discuss the challenges facing natural history studies for leukodystrophies and detail a novel standardized approach to creating a longitudinal natural history study using existing medical records. Prospective studies are uniquely challenging for rare diseases. Delays in diagnosis and overall rarity limit the timely collection of natural history data. When feasible, prospective studies are often cross-sectional rather than longitudinal and are unlikely to capture pre- or early- symptomatic disease trajectories, limiting their utility in characterizing the full natural history of the disease. Therapeutic development in leukodystrophies is subject to these same obstacles. The Global Leukodystrophy Initiative Clinical Trials Network (GLIA-CTN) comprises of a network of research institutions across the United States, supported by a multi-center biorepository protocol, to map the longitudinal clinical course of disease across leukodystrophies. As part of GLIA-CTN, we developed Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) that delineated all study processes related to staff training, source documentation, and data sharing. Additionally, the SOP detailed the standardized approach to data extraction including diagnosis, clinical presentation, and medical events, such as age at gastrostomy tube placement. The key variables for extraction were selected through face validity, and common electronic case report forms (eCRF) across leukodystrophies were created to collect analyzable data. To enhance the depth of the data, clinical notes are extracted into \"original\" and \"imputed\" encounters, with imputed encounter referring to a historic event (e.g., loss of ambulation 3 months prior). Retrospective Functional Assessments were assigned by child neurologists, using a blinded dual-rater approach and score discrepancies were adjudicated by a third rater. Upon completion of extraction, data source verification is performed. Data missingness was evaluated using statistics. The proposed methodology will enable us to leverage existing medical records to address the persistent gap in natural history data within this unique disease group, allow for assessment of clinical trajectory both pre- and post-formal diagnosis, and promote recruitment of larger cohorts."

Presently, therapeutic options to counteract them are limited and, in the case of direct genome editing, risky.

We further show an increase in frameshifting rate at the premature termination sequence found in the HEXA gene of Tay-Sachs disease patients, or a breast cancer cell line that harbors a tumor-driving frameshift mutation in GATA3. Although the overall increase in frameshifting would need further improvement for clinical applications, our results underscore the potential of exogenous factors, such as Eu eRF1, to increase frameshifting in human cells."

We report a remarkable case of a three-year-old South Asian male with infantile GM2 gangliosidosis, compounded by bronchopneumonia, a rarely documented complication in Tay-Sachs patients. The patient presented with recurrent seizures, fever, cough, and developmental delay. Confirmation of the diagnosis was obtained through reduced Hex A enzyme activity, corroborated by imaging and blood and urine analyses. Family history was significant for consanguinity and similar sibling fatalities. Despite the progressive nature of the disease, symptomatic management, including antiepileptic drugs, antibiotic therapy, and supportive care, led to an improvement in clinical condition, though ongoing monitoring remains essential. In this case, the coexistence of bronchopneumonia with Tay-Sachs disease is unusual, reflecting the necessity for this case report. The patient's response highlights the potential for symptomatic management, the importance of genetic counseling, and the imperative for research into gene and enzyme replacement therapies. The uniqueness of this case provides novel insights into the disease's spectrum, enhancing awareness, encouraging early diagnosis, and refining care strategies for Tay-Sachs disease, aligning with the broader goals of improving patient outcomes and advancing medical research."

    "title": "Lithium treatment rescues dysfunctional autophagy in the cell models of Tay-Sachs disease.",
    "abstract": "Tay-Sachs disease is a rare lysosomal storage disorder (LSD) caused by a mutation in the HexA gene coding β-hexosaminidase A enzyme. The disruption of the HexA gene causes the accumulation of GM2 ganglioside resulting in progressive neurodegeneration in humans. Surprisingly, Hexa-/- mice did not show neurological phenotypes. Our group recently generated a murine model of Tay-Sachs disease exhibiting excessive GM2 accumulation and severe neuropathological abnormalities mimicking Tay-Sachs patients. Previously, we reported impaired autophagic flux in the brain of Hexa/-Neu3-/- mice. However, regulation of autophagic flux using inducers has not been clarified in Tay-Sachs disease cells. Here, we evaluated the effects of lithium treatment on dysfunctional autophagic flux using LC3 and p62 in the fibroblast and neuroglia of Hexa-/-Neu3-/- mice and Tay-Sachs patients. We discovered the clearance of accumulating autophagosomes, aggregate-prone metabolites, and GM2 ganglioside under lithium-induced conditions. Our data suggest that targeting autophagic flux with an autophagy inducer might be a rational therapeutic strategy for the treatment of Tay-Sachs disease."

    "abstract": "The pathological accumulation of GM2 ganglioside associated with Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) and Sandhoff disease (SD) occurs in individuals who possess mutant forms of the heterodimer β-hexosaminidase A (Hex A) because of mutation of the <i>HEXA</i> and <i>HEXB</i> genes, respectively. With a lack of approved therapies, patients experience rapid neurological decline resulting in early death. A novel bicistronic vector carrying both <i>HEXA</i> and <i>HEXB</i> previously demonstrated promising results in mouse models of SD following neonatal intravenous administration, including significant reduction in GM2 accumulation, increased levels of Hex A, and a 2-fold extension of survival. The aim of the present study was to identify an optimal dose of the bicistronic vector in 6-week-old SD mice by an intrathecal route of administration along with transient immunosuppression, to inform possible clinical translation. Three doses of the bicistronic vector were tested: 2.5e11, 1.25e11, and 0.625e11 vector genomes per mouse. The highest dose provided the greatest increase in biochemical and behavioral parameters, such that treated mice lived to a median age of 56 weeks (>3 times the lifespan of the SD controls). These results have direct implications in deciding a human equivalent dose for TSD/SD and have informed the approval of a clinical trial application (NCT04798235)."

    "abstract": "Biomarkers are molecules that can be used to observe changes in an individual's biochemical or medical status and provide information to aid diagnosis or treatment decisions. Dysregulation in lipid metabolism in the brain is a major risk factor for many neurodegenerative disorders, including frontotemporal dementia, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Thus, there is a growing interest in using lipids as biomarkers in neurodegenerative diseases, with the anionic phospholipid bis(monoacylglycerol)phosphate and (glyco-)sphingolipids being the most promising lipid classes thus far. In this review, we provide a general overview of lipid biology, provide examples of abnormal lysosomal lipid metabolism in neurodegenerative diseases, and discuss how these insights might offer novel and promising opportunities in biomarker development and therapeutic discovery. Finally, we discuss the challenges and opportunities of lipid biomarkers and biomarker panels in diagnosis, prognosis, and/or treatment response in the clinic."

    "abstract": "GM2 gangliosidoses, a group of autosomal-recessive neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disorders, result from β-hexosaminidase (HEX) deficiency with GM2 ganglioside as its main substrate. Historically, GM2 gangliosidoses have been classified into infantile, juvenile, and late-onset forms. With disease-modifying treatment trials now on the horizon, a more fine-grained understanding of the disease course is needed. We aimed to map and stratify the clinical course of GM2 gangliosidoses in a multicenter cohort of pediatric and adult patients. Patients were stratified according to age at onset and age at diagnosis. The 2 resulting GM2 disease clusters were characterized in-depth for respective disease features (detailed standardized clinical, laboratory, and MRI assessments) and disease evolution. In 21 patients with GM2 gangliosidosis (17 Tay-Sachs, 2 GM2 activator deficiency, 2 Sandhoff disease), 2 disease clusters were discriminated: an early-onset and early diagnosis cluster (type I; n = 8, including activator deficiency and Sandhoff disease) and a cluster with very variable onset and long interval until diagnosis (type II; n = 13 patients). In type I, rapid onset of developmental stagnation and regression, spasticity, and seizures dominated the clinical picture. Cherry red spot, startle reactions, and elevated AST were only seen in this cluster. In type II, problems with balance or gait, muscle weakness, dysarthria, and psychiatric symptoms were specific and frequent symptoms. Ocular signs were common, including supranuclear vertical gaze palsy in 30%. MRI involvement of basal ganglia and peritrigonal hyperintensity was seen only in type I, whereas predominant infratentorial atrophy (or normal MRI) was characteristic in type II. These types were, at least in part, associated with certain genetic variants. Age at onset alone seems not sufficient to adequately predict different disease courses in GM2 gangliosidosis, as required for upcoming trial planning. We propose an alternative classification based on age at disease onset and dynamics, predicted by clinical features and biomarkers, into type I-an early-onset, rapid progression cluster-and type II-a variable onset, slow progression cluster. Specific diagnostic workup, including GM2 gangliosidosis, should be performed in patients with combined ataxia plus lower motor neuron weakness to identify type II patients."

    "abstract": "Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) is a progressive heritable neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the deficiency of the lysosomal β-hexosaminidase enzyme (Hex<sup>-/-</sup>) and the storage of GM2 ganglioside, as well as other related glycoconjugates. Along with motor difficulties, TSD patients also manifest a gradual loss of skills and behavioral problems, followed by early death. Unfortunately, there is no cure for TSD; however, research on treatments and therapeutic approaches is ongoing. This study underlines the importance of gemfibrozil (GFB), an FDA-approved lipid-lowering drug, in inhibiting the disease process in a transgenic mouse model of Tay-Sachs. Oral administration of GFB significantly suppressed glial activation and inflammation, while also reducing the accumulation of GM2 gangliosides/glycoconjugates in the motor cortex of Tay-Sachs mice. Furthermore, oral GFB improved behavioral performance and increased the life expectancy of Tay-Sachs mice. While investigating the mechanism, we found that oral administration of GFB increased the level of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) in the brain of Tay-Sachs mice, and that GFB remained unable to reduce glycoconjugates and improve behavior and survival in Tay-Sachs mice lacking PPARα. Our results indicate a beneficial function of GFB that employs a PPARα-dependent mechanism to halt the progression of TSD and increase longevity in Tay-Sachs mice."

    "abstract": "Cerebellar atrophy is a characteristic sign of late-onset Tay-Sachs disease (LOTS). Other structural neuroimaging abnormalities are inconsistently reported. Our study aimed to perform a detailed whole-brain analysis and quantitatively characterize morphometric changes in LOTS patients. Fourteen patients (8 M/6F) with LOTS from three centers were included in this retrospective study. For morphometric brain analyses, we used deformation-based morphometry, voxel-based morphometry, surface-based morphometry, and spatially unbiased cerebellar atlas template. The quantitative whole-brain morphometric analysis confirmed the finding of profound pontocerebellar atrophy with most affected cerebellar lobules V and VI in LOTS patients. Additionally, the atrophy of structures mainly involved in motor control, including bilateral ventral and lateral thalamic nuclei, primary motor and sensory cortex, supplementary motor area, and white matter regions containing corticospinal tract, was present. The atrophy of the right amygdala, hippocampus, and regions of occipital, parietal and temporal white matter was also observed in LOTS patients in contrast with controls (p < 0.05, FWE corrected). Patients with dysarthria and those initially presenting with ataxia had more severe cerebellar atrophy. Our results show predominant impairment of cerebellar regions responsible for speech and hand motor function in LOTS patients. Widespread morphological changes of motor cortical and subcortical regions and tracts in white matter indicate abnormalities in central motor circuits likely coresponsible for impaired speech and motor function."

In these rare lysosomal storage disorders, deficiency of β-hexosaminidase A results in excessive accumulation of GM2 ganglioside primarily within neurons, leading to cell death and progressive neurodegenerative symptoms, including ataxia, dysarthria, muscle weakness, tremors, atrophy, and psychosis. Presentation is variable and often mimics more common neurodegenerative disorders. We conducted semi-structured interviews on GM2 gangliosidoses diagnosis and treatment with five experts, 30 neurologists, and 28 patients and caregivers. Symptom onset occurred during adolescence/early adulthood in 92% of patients (median age: 14 years). Patients first visited a healthcare provider at a median age of 20 years and received a GM2 diagnosis at a median age of 26 years. Nearly all patients reported problems with their legs and balance starting from symptom onset. Problems with memory, attention span, speech and fatigue were reported more after diagnosis. Patients visited an average of eight healthcare providers before receiving a diagnosis; 64% were diagnosed by a neurologist. Four neurologists (13%) in our sample were aware that there are late-onset forms of GM2 gangliosidosis. The path to diagnosis is long for this late-onset form of a classically fatal infantile disease."

Previous studies considered LOTS and LOSD clinically indistinguishable; recent studies have challenged this. We performed a scoping review to ascertain whether imaging and clinical features may differentiate these diseases. We examined MEDLINE/non-MEDLINE databases up to May 2022. Articles reporting brain imaging findings in genetically/enzymatically confirmed LOGG, symptom onset at age ≥ 10 years (or evaluated at least once ≥18 years) were included, yielding 170 LOGG patients (LOTS = 127, LOSD = 43) across 68 papers. We compared LOTS versus LOSD and performed regression analyses. Results were corrected for multiple comparisons. Age of onset was lower in LOTS versus LOSD (17.9 ± 8.2 vs. 23.9 ± 14.4 years, p = 0.017), although disease duration was similar (p = 0.34). LOTS more commonly had psychosis/bipolar symptoms (35.0% vs. 9.30%, p = 0.011) but less frequent swallowing problems (4.10% vs. 18.60%, p = 0.041). Cerebellar atrophy was more common in LOTS (89.0%) versus LOSD (60.5%), p < 0.0001, with more severe atrophy in LOTS (p = 0.0005). Brainstem atrophy was documented only in LOTS (14.2%). Independent predictors of LOTS versus LOSD (odds ratio [95% confidence interval]) included the presence of psychosis/bipolar symptoms (4.95 [1.59-19.52], p = 0.011), no swallowing symptoms (0.16 [0.036-0.64], p = 0.011), and cerebellar atrophy (5.81 [2.10-17.08], p = 0.0009). Lower age of onset (0.96 [0.93-1.00], p = 0.075) and tremor (2.50 [0.94-7.43], p = 0.078) were marginally statistically significant but felt relevant to include in the model.

    "abstract": "GM2 gangliosidoses are a group of neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disorders that are characterized by the accumulation of GM2 gangliosides (GM2), leading to rapid neurological decline and death. The hydrolysis of GM2 requires the specific synthesis, processing, and combination of products of three genes-<i>HEXA</i>, <i>HEXB</i>, and <i>GM2A</i>-within the cell's lysosomes. Mutations in these genes result in Tay-Sachs disease, Sandhoff disease, or AB-variant GM2 gangliosidosis (ABGM2), respectively. ABGM2, the rarest of the three types, is characterized by a mutation in the <i>GM2A</i> gene, which encodes the GM2 activator (GM2A) protein. Being a monogenic disease, gene therapy is a plausible and likely effective method of treatment for ABGM2. This study aimed at assessing the effects of administering a one-time intravenous treatment of single-stranded Adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (ssAAV9)-<i>GM2A</i> viral vector at a dose of 1 × 10<sup>14</sup> vector genomes (vg) per kilogram per mouse in an ABGM2 mouse model (<i>Gm2a</i><sup>-/-</sup>). <i>ssAAV9-GM2A</i> was administered at 1-day (neonatal) or 6-weeks of age (adult-stage). The results demonstrated that, in comparison to <i>Gm2a</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice that received a vehicle injection, the treated mice had reduced GM2 accumulation within the central nervous system and had long-term persistence of vector genomes in the brain and liver. This proof-of-concept study is a step forward towards the development of a clinically therapeutic approach for the treatment of patients with ABGM2."

A case series of four unrelated patients of non-Ashkenazi Jewish origin with a predominantly, and in some cases pure, neuromuscular phenotype with evidence of a motor neuronopathy on electromyography is presented. Cerebellar atrophy, reported to be a ubiquitous feature in LOTS, was absent in all patients. This case series provides evidence to support a pure neuromuscular phenotype in LOTS, which should be considered in the differential diagnosis of anterior horn cell disorders."

While a diagnosis of \"Little's disease\" was made during life, his postmortem brain investigation at Munich neuropathology (\"Deutsche Forschungsanstalt für Psychiatrie\") revealed the diagnosis of \"amaurotic idiocy\" (AI). AI, as exemplified by Tay-Sachs-Disease (TSD), back then was not yet understood as a specific inborn error of metabolism encompassing several disease entities. Many neuropathological studies were performed on AI, but the underlying processes could only be revealed by new scientific techniques such as biochemical analysis of nervous tissue, deciphering AI as nervous system lipid storage diseases, e.g. GM2-gangliosidosis. In 1963, Sandhoff & Jatzkewitz published an article on a \"biochemically special form of AI\" reporting striking differences when comparing their biochemical observations of hallmark features of TSD to tissue composition in a single case: the boy Kn. This was the first description of \"GM1-Gangliosidosis\", later understood as resulting from genetically determined deficiency in beta-galactosidase. Here we present illustrative materials from this historic patient, including selected diagnostic slides from the case \"Kn\" in virtual microscopy, original records and other illustrative material available. Finally, we present results from genetic analysis performed on archived tissue proving beta-galactosidase-gene mutation, verifying the 1963 interpretation as correct.

To a large extent, resolution reflected biochemical understanding that took until mid-20th century, and beyond, to change how physicians viewed diseases in general. With this, biochemical carrier screening and prenatal biochemical diagnosis have become routinely available, and it is a model for carrier population screening, while gene therapy for the disease has been reported with some degree of success.

First reported in 1881, GM2 gangliosidosis has no effective treatment today, and children succumb to the disease after a protracted neurodegenerative course and semi-vegetative state. This study seeks to further develop adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene therapy for human translation. Cats with Sandhoff disease were treated by intracranial injection of vectors expressing feline β-N-acetylhexosaminidase, the enzyme deficient in GM2 gangliosidosis. Hexosaminidase activity throughout the brain and spinal cord was above normal after treatment, with highest activities at the injection sites (thalamus and deep cerebellar nuclei). Ganglioside storage was reduced throughout the brain and spinal cord, with near complete clearance in many regions. While untreated cats with Sandhoff disease lived for 4.4 ± 0.6 months, AAV-treated cats lived to 19.1 ± 8.6 months, and 3 of 9 cats lived >21 months. Correction of the central nervous system was so effective that significant increases in lifespan led to the emergence of otherwise subclinical peripheral disease, including megacolon, enlarged stomach and urinary bladder, soft tissue spinal cord compression, and patellar luxation. Throughout the gastrointestinal tract, neurons of the myenteric and submucosal plexuses developed profound pathology, demonstrating that the enteric nervous system was inadequately treated.

    "abstract": "GM2 gangliosidosis is a group of genetic disorders that result in the accumulation of GM2 ganglioside (GM2) in brain cells, leading to progressive central nervous system (CNS) atrophy and premature death in patients. AB-variant GM2 gangliosidosis (ABGM2) arises from loss-of-function mutations in the GM2 activator protein (GM2AP), which is essential for the breakdown of GM2 in a key catabolic pathway required for CNS lipid homeostasis. In this study, we show that intrathecal delivery of self-complementary adeno-associated virus serotype-9 (scAAV9) harbouring a functional human <i>GM2A</i> transgene (<i>scAAV9.hGM2A</i>) can prevent GM2 accumulation in in GM2AP-deficient mice (<i>Gm2a</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice). Additionally, <i>scAAV9.hGM2A</i> efficiently distributes to all tested regions of the CNS within 14 weeks post-injection and remains detectable for the lifespan of these animals (up to 104 weeks). Remarkably, GM2AP expression from the transgene scales with increasing doses of <i>scAAV9.hGM2A</i> (0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 × 10<sup>11</sup> vector genomes (vg) per mouse), and this correlates with dose-dependent correction of GM2 accumulation in the brain. No severe adverse events were observed, and comorbidities in treated mice were comparable to those in disease-free cohorts. Lastly, all doses yielded corrective outcomes. These data indicate that <i>scAAV9.hGM2A</i> treatment is relatively non-toxic and tolerable, and biochemically corrects GM2 accumulation in the CNS-the main cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with ABGM2. Importantly, these results constitute proof-of-principle for treating ABGM2 with <i>scAAV9.hGM2A</i> by means of a single intrathecal administration and establish a foundation for future preclinical research."

Delay of symptom onset and increase in lifespan in a GM1 gangliosidosis cat model after adeno-associated viral (AAV) gene therapy treatment provide the basis for AAV gene therapy trials. The availability of validated biomarkers would greatly improve assessment of therapeutic efficacy. The liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was used to screen oligosaccharides as potential biomarkers for GM1 gangliosidosis. The structures of pentasaccharide biomarkers were determined with mass spectrometry, as well as chemical and enzymatic degradations. Comparison of LC-MS/MS data of endogenous and synthetic compounds confirmed the identification. The study samples were analyzed with fully validated LC-MS/MS methods. We identified two pentasaccharide biomarkers, H3N2a and H3N2b, that were elevated more than 18-fold in patient plasma, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and urine. Only H3N2b was detectable in the cat model, and it was negatively correlated with β-galactosidase activity. Following intravenous (IV) AAV9 gene therapy treatment, reduction of H3N2b was observed in central nervous system, urine, plasma, and CSF samples from the cat model and in urine, plasma, and CSF samples from a patient. Reduction of H3N2b accurately reflected normalization of neuropathology in the cat model and improvement of clinical outcomes in the patient. These results demonstrate that H3N2b is a useful pharmacodynamic biomarker to evaluate the efficacy of gene therapy for GM1 gangliosidosis. H3N2b will facilitate the translation of gene therapy from animal models to patients.

We included the observational or interventional studies reporting GM2g patients under miglustat therapy by searching PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus. Data extracted included the natural history of individual patient data, as well as the safety and efficacy of miglustat in GM2g patients. The quality assessment was performed using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal checklist. A total of 1023 records were identified and reduced to 621 after removing duplicates. After screening and applying the eligibility criteria, 10 articles and 2 abstracts met the inclusion criteria. Overall, the studies represented 54 patients with GM2g under treatment with miglustat and 22 patients with GM2g in the control group. Among patients with available data, 14 and 54 have been diagnosed with Sandhoff disease and Tay-Sachs disease, respectively. Patients included in this review consisted of 23 infantile, 4 late-infantile, 18 juvenile, and 31 adult-onset GM2g. Although miglustat should not be considered a definite treatment for GM2g, it appears that patients, particularly those with infantile or late-infantile GM2g, could benefit from miglustat therapy to some extent. We also make some suggestions regarding future studies presenting their findings in a standard format to facilitate pooling the available data in such rare diseases for a more comprehensive conclusion."

    "abstract": "The Unfolded protein response (UPR), triggered by stress in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), is a key driver of neurodegenerative diseases. GM2 gangliosidosis, which includes Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff disease, is caused by an accumulation of GM2, mainly in the brain, that leads to progressive neurodegeneration. Previously, we demonstrated in a cellular model of GM2 gangliosidosis that PERK, a UPR sensor, contributes to neuronal death. There is currently no approved treatment for these disorders. Chemical chaperones, such as ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), have been found to alleviate ER stress in cell and animal models. UDCA's ability to move across the blood-brain barrier makes it interesting as a therapeutic tool. Here, we found that UDCA significantly diminished the neurite atrophy induced by GM2 accumulation in primary neuron cultures. It also decreased the up-regulation of pro-apoptotic CHOP, a downstream PERK-signaling component. To explore its potential mechanisms of action, in vitro kinase assays and crosslinking experiments were performed with different variants of recombinant protein PERK, either in solution or in reconstituted liposomes. The results suggest a direct interaction between UDCA and the cytosolic domain of PERK, which promotes kinase phosphorylation and dimerization."

    "title": "Autophagic flux is impaired in the brain tissue of Tay-Sachs disease mouse model.",
    "abstract": "Tay-Sachs disease is a lethal lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations in the HexA gene encoding the α subunit of the lysosomal β-hexosaminidase enzyme (HEXA). Abnormal GM2 ganglioside accumulation causes progressive deterioration in the central nervous system in Tay-Sachs patients. Hexa-/- mouse model failed to display abnormal phenotype. Recently, our group generated Hexa-/-Neu3-/- mouse showed severe neuropathological indications similar to Tay-Sachs patients. Despite excessive GM2 ganglioside accumulation in the brain and visceral organs, the regulation of autophagy has not been clarified yet in the Tay-Sachs disease mouse model. Therefore, we investigated distinct steps of autophagic flux using markers including LC3 and p62 in four different brain regions from the Hexa-/-Neu3-/- mice model of Tay-Sachs disease. Our data revealed accumulated autophagosomes and autophagolysosomes indicating impairment in autophagic flux in the brain. We suggest that autophagy might be a new therapeutic target for the treatment of devastating Tay-Sachs disease."

    "title": "Biochemical and mutational analyses of HEXA in a cohort of Egyptian patients with infantile Tay-Sachs disease. Expansion of the mutation spectrum.",
    "abstract": "Tay-Sachs disease (TSD), an autosomal recessively inherited neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disease, reported worldwide with a high incidence among population of Eastern European and Ashkenazi Jewish descent. Mutations in the alpha subunit of HEXA that encodes for the β-hexosaminidase-A lead to deficient enzyme activity and TSD phenotype. This study is the first to highlight the HEXA sequence variations spectrum in a cohort of Egyptian patients with infantile TSD. This study involved 13 Egyptian infant/children patients presented with the infantile form of TSD, ten of the 13 patients were born to consanguineous marriages. β-hexosaminidase-A enzyme activity was markedly reduced in the 13 patients with a mean activity of 3 µmol/L/h ± 1.56. Sanger sequencing of the HEXA' coding regions and splicing junctions enabled a detection rate of ~ 62% (8/13) in our patients revealing the molecular defects in eight patients; six homozygous-mutant children (five of them were the product of consanguineous marriages) and two patients showed their mutant alleles in heterozygous genotypes, while no disease-causing mutation was identified in the remaining patients. Regulatory intragenic mutations or del/dup may underlie the molecular defect in those patients showing no relevant pathogenic sequencing variants or in the two patients with a heterozygous genotype of the mutant allele. This research identified three novel, likely pathogenic variants in association with the TSD phenotype; two missense, c.920A > C (E307A) and c.952C > G (H318D) in exon 8, and a single base deletion c.484delG causing a frameshift E162Rfs*37 (p.Glu162ArgfsTer37) in exon 5. Three recurrent disease-causing missense mutations; c.1495C > T (R499C), c.1511G > A(R504H), and c.1510C > T(R504C) in exon 13 were identified in five of the eight patients. None of the variants was detected in 50 healthy Egyptians' DNA. Five variants, likely benign or of uncertain significance, S3T, I436V, E506E, and T2T, in exons 1, 11,13, & 1 were detected in our study. For the proper diagnostics, genetic counseling, and primary prevention, our study stresses the important role of Next Generation Sequencing approaches in delineating the molecular defect in TSD-candidate patients that showed negative Sanger sequencing or a heterozygous mutant allele in their genetic testing results. Interestingly, the three recurrent TSD associated mutations were clustered on chromosome 13 and accounted for 38% of the HEXA mutations detected in this study. This suggested exon 13 as the first candidate for sequencing screening in Egyptian patients with infantile TSD. Larger studies involving our regional population are recommended, hence unique disease associated pathogenic variations could be identified."

    "abstract": "Sphingolipidoses are defined as a group of rare hereditary diseases resulting from mutations in the genes encoding lysosomal enzymes. This group of lysosomal storage diseases includes more than 10 genetic disorders, including GM1-gangliosidosis, Tay-Sachs disease, Sandhoff disease, the AB variant of GM2-gangliosidosis, Fabry disease, Gaucher disease, metachromatic leukodystrophy, Krabbe disease, Niemann-Pick disease, Farber disease, etc. Enzyme deficiency results in accumulation of sphingolipids in various cell types, and the nervous system is also usually affected. There are currently no known effective methods for the treatment of sphingolipidoses; however, gene therapy seems to be a promising therapeutic variant for this group of diseases. In this review, we discuss gene therapy approaches for sphingolipidoses that are currently being investigated in clinical trials, among which adeno-associated viral vector-based approaches and transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells genetically modified with lentiviral vectors seem to be the most effective."

Consecutive patients with Tay-Sachs and Niemann-Pick disease evaluated by the pediatric transplant and cellular therapy team, for whom a handheld OCT scan was obtained, were included. Demographic information, clinical history, fundus photography, and OCT scans were reviewed. Two masked graders evaluated each of the scans. The study included 3 patients with Tay-Sachs disease (5, 8, and 14 months old) and 1 patient with Niemann-Pick disease (12 months old). All patients had bilateral cherry-red spots on fundus examination. In all patients with Tay-Sachs disease, handheld OCT revealed parafoveal ganglion cell layer (GCL) thickening, increased nerve fiber layer, and GCL reflectivity, and different levels of residual normal signal GCL. The patient with Niemann-Pick disease had similar parafoveal findings, but there was a thicker residual GCL. Sedated visual evoked potentials were unrecordable in all 4 patients despite 3 of them demonstrating normal visual behavior for age. Patients with good vision had relative sparing of the GCL on OCT. The cherry-red spots in lysosomal storage diseases appear as perifoveal thickening and hyperreflectivity of the GCL on OCT. In this case series, residual GCL with normal signal proved to be a better biomarker for visual function than visual evoked potentials and could be considered for future therapeutic trials. <b>[<i>J Pediatr Ophthalmol Strabismus</i>. 2023;60(6):435-440.]</b>."

    "abstract": "GM2-Gangliosidosis are a group of inherited lysosomal storage pathologies characterized by a large accumulation of G<sub>M2</sub> ganglioside in the lysosome. They are caused by mutation in HEXA or HEXB causing reduced or absent activity of a lysosomal β-hexosaminidase A, or mutation in GM2A causing defect in GM2 activator protein (GM2AP), an essential protein for the activity of the enzyme. Biochemical diagnosis relies on the measurement of β-hexosaminidases A and B activities, which is able to detect lysosomal enzyme deficiency but fails to identify defects in GM2AP. We developed a rapid, specific and sensitive liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based method to measure simultaneously G<sub>M1</sub>, G<sub>M2</sub>, G<sub>M3</sub> and G<sub>D3</sub> molecular species. Gangliosides were analysed in plasma from 19 patients with GM2-Gangliosidosis: Tay-Sachs (n = 9), Sandhoff (n = 9) and AB variant of GM2-Gangliosidosis (n = 1) and compared to 20 age-matched controls. Among patients, 12 have a late adult-juvenile-onset and 7 have an infantile early-onset of the disease. Plasma G<sub>M2</sub> molecular species were increased in all GM2-Gangliosidosis patients (19/19), including the patient with GM2A mutation, compared to control individuals and compared to patients with different other lysosomal storage diseases. G<sub>M2</sub>34:1 and G<sub>M2</sub>34:1/G<sub>M3</sub>34:1 ratio discriminated patients from controls with 100% sensitivity and specificity. G<sub>M2</sub>34:1 and G<sub>M2</sub>34:1/G<sub>M3</sub>34:1 were higher in patients with early-onset compared to those with late-onset of the disease, suggesting a relationship with severity. Longitudinal analysis in one adult with Tay-Sachs disease over 9 years showed a positive correlation of G<sub>M2</sub>34:1 and G<sub>M2</sub>34:1/G<sub>M3</sub>34:1 ratio with age at sampling. We propose that plasma G<sub>M2</sub> 34:1 and its ratio to G<sub>M3</sub> 34:1 could be sensitive and specific biochemical diagnostic biomarkers for GM2-Gangliosidosis including AB variant and could be useful as a first line diagnostic test and potential biomarkers for monitoring upcoming therapeutic efficacy."

    "title": "Gene expression changes in Tay-Sachs disease begin early in fetal brain development.",
    "abstract": "Treatment of monogenic disorders has historically relied on symptomatic management with limited ability to target primary molecular deficits. However, recent advances in gene therapy and related technologies aim to correct these underlying deficiencies, raising the possibility of disease management or even prevention for diseases that can be treated pre-symptomatically. Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) would be one such candidate, however very little is known about the presymptomatic stage of TSD. To better understand the effects of TSD on brain development, we evaluated the transcriptomes of human fetal brain samples with biallelic pathogenic variants in HEXA. We identified dramatic changes in the transcriptome, suggesting a perturbation of normal development. We also observed a shift in the expression of the sphingolipid metabolic pathway away from production of the HEXA substrate, GM2 ganglioside, presumptively to compensate for dysfunction of the enzyme. However, we do not observe transcriptomic signatures of end-stage disease, suggesting that developmental perturbations precede neurodegeneration. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the relationship between fetal disease pathology in juvenile onset TSD and the analysis of gene expression in fetal TSD tissues. This study highlights the need to better understand the \"pre-symptomatic\" stage of disease to set realistic expectations for patients receiving early therapeutic intervention."

The diagnosis of LOTS is easily missed because of the multifaced presentation of these patients, who can initially be assessed by neuromuscular or movement disorder specialists, or psychiatrists. Clinical trials are now becoming available for LOTS. Therefore, early diagnosis can be detrimental for these patients and for insuring informative research outcomes. We characterized a cohort of nine patients with LOTS through a detailed clinical and video description. We then reviewed the available literature regarding the clinical description of patients with LOTS. Our findings were summarized based on the predominant phenotype of presentation to highlight diagnostic clues to guide the diagnosis of LOTS for different neurology specialists (neuromuscular, movement disorders) and psychiatrist. We described a cohort of 9 new patients with LOTS seen at our clinic. Our literature review identified 76 patients mainly presenting with a neuromuscular, cerebellar, psychiatric, stuttering, or movement disorder phenotype. Diagnostic tips, such as the triceps sign, distinct speech patterns, early psychiatric presentation and impulsivity, as well as neurological symptoms (cerebellar or neuromuscular) in patients with a prominent psychiatric presentation, are described. Specific diagnostics clues can help neurologists and psychiatrists in the early diagnosis of LOTS disease. Our work also represent the first video presentation of a cohort of patients with LOTS that can help different specialists to familiarize with these features and improve diagnostic outcomes. Late-Onset Tay-Sachs (LOTS) disease, a severe progressive neurological condition, has multifaced presentations causing diagnostic delays that can significantly affect research outcomes now that clinical trials are available.

No approved treatment for GM1 exists. In this study-the first to explore priorities of parents of subjects with pediatric onset forms of GM1-we address a crucial gap by characterizing symptoms most critical to caregivers of children with GM1 to treat. Our two-part, mixed-methods approach began with focus groups, followed by interviews with a distinct set of parents. Interviews included a prioritization activity that used best-worst scaling. Quantitative data were analyzed descriptively. Qualitative data were analyzed using thematic analysis and rapid analysis process. Parents prioritized the symptoms they believed would increase their child's lifespan and improve their perceived quality of life (QoL); these symptoms focused on communicating wants/needs, preventing pain/discomfort, getting around and moving one's body, and enhancing eating/feeding. Although lifespan was highly valued, almost all parents would not desire a longer lifespan without acceptable child QoL. Parents indicated high caregiver burden and progressive reduction in QoL for children with GM1. This novel study of caregiver priorities identified important symptoms for endpoints' selection in patient-focused drug development in the context of high disease impact and unmet treatment needs."

This clinical trial investigated N-acetyl-l-leucine (NALL), an orally administered, modified amino acid in pediatric (≥6 years) and adult patients with GM2 gangliosidoses. In this phase IIb, multinational, open-label, rater-blinded study (IB1001-202), male and female patients aged ≥6 years with a genetically confirmed diagnosis of GM2 gangliosidoses received orally administered NALL for a 6-week treatment period (4 g/d in patients ≥13 years, weight-tiered doses for patients 6-12 years), followed by a 6-week posttreatment washout period. For the primary Clinical Impression of Change in Severity analysis, patient performance on a predetermined primary anchor test (the 8-Meter Walk Test or the 9-Hole Peg Test) at baseline, after 6 weeks on NALL, and again after a 6-week washout period was videoed and evaluated centrally by blinded raters. Secondary outcomes included assessments of ataxia, clinical global impression, and quality of life. Thirty patients between the age of 6 and 55 years were enrolled. Twenty-nine had an on-treatment assessment and were included in the primary modified intention-to-treat analysis. The study met its CI-CS primary end point (mean difference 0.71, SD = 2.09, 90% CI 0.00, 1.50, <i>p</i> = 0.039), as well as secondary measures of ataxia and global impression. NALL was safe and well tolerated, with no serious adverse reactions. Treatment with NALL was associated with statistically significant and clinically relevant changes in functioning and quality of life in patients with GM2 gangliosidosis. NALL was safe and well tolerated, contributing to an overall favorable risk:benefit profile. NALL is a promising, easily administered (oral) therapeutic option for these rare, debilitating diseases with immense unmet medical needs. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03759665; registered on November 30, 2018), EudraCT (2018-004406-25), and DRKS (DRKS00017539). The first patient was enrolled on June 7, 2019.

At the 1e13 vg/kg dose, evidence of genome editing was detected through albumin-transgene fusion transcripts in liver for MPS II (n = 2) and MPS I (n = 1) subjects. The MPS I subject also had a transient increase in leukocyte iduronidase activity to the lower normal range. At the 5e13 vg/kg dose, one MPS II subject had a transient increase in plasma iduronate-2-sulfatase approaching normal levels and one MPS I subject approached mid-normal levels of leukocyte iduronidase activity with no evidence of genome editing. The hemophilia B subject was not able to decrease use of factor IX concentrate; genome editing could not be assessed. Overall, ZFN in vivo editing therapy had a favorable safety profile with evidence of targeted genome editing in liver, but no long-term enzyme expression in blood."

    "abstract": "The gangliosidoses GM2 are a group of pathologies mainly affecting the central nervous system due to the impaired GM2 ganglioside degradation inside the lysosome. Under physiological conditions, GM2 ganglioside is catabolized by the β-hexosaminidase A in a GM2 activator protein-dependent mechanism. In contrast, uncharged substrates such as globosides and some glycosaminoglycans can be hydrolyzed by the β-hexosaminidase B. Monogenic mutations on <i>HEXA</i>, <i>HEXB</i>, or <i>GM2A</i> genes arise in the Tay-Sachs (TSD), Sandhoff (SD), and AB variant diseases, respectively. In this work, we validated a CRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing strategy that relies on a Cas9 nickase (nCas9) as a potential approach for treating GM2 gangliosidoses using in vitro models for TSD and SD. The nCas9 contains a mutation in the catalytic RuvC domain but maintains the active HNH domain, which reduces potential off-target effects. Liposomes (LPs)- and novel magnetoliposomes (MLPs)-based vectors were used to deliver the CRISPR/nCas9 system. When LPs were used as a vector, positive outcomes were observed for the β-hexosaminidase activity, glycosaminoglycans levels, lysosome mass, and oxidative stress. In the case of MLPs, a high cytocompatibility and transfection ratio was observed, with a slight increase in the β-hexosaminidase activity and significant oxidative stress recovery in both TSD and SD cells. These results show the remarkable potential of CRISPR/nCas9 as a new alternative for treating GM2 gangliosidoses, as well as the superior performance of non-viral vectors in enhancing the potency of this therapeutic approach."

We recently generated a novel mice model with a combined deficiency of β-hexosaminidase A and neuraminidase 3 (<i>Hexa-/-Neu3-/-</i>) that mimics both the neuropathological and clinical abnormalities of early-onset Tay-Sachs disease. Here, we aimed to explore the secondary accumulation of lipids in the brain of <i>Hexa-/-Neu3-/-</i> mice. <b>Materials and Methods:</b> In the cortex and hippocampus of five-month-old <i>WT</i>, <i>Hexa-/-</i>, <i>Neu3-/-</i>, and <i>Hexa-/-Neu3-/-</i> mice, lipid levels belonging to glycerolipids, glycerophospholipids, and sterol lipids were evaluated using a shotgun lipidomics approach. The levels of myelin were also assessed by luxol fast blue staining and immunohistochemistry using antibodies against myelin basic protein. We further examined glycoconjugate and cholesterol levels by periodic acid-Schiff and filipin staining, respectively. Toluidine blue staining was also performed to display axonal degeneration. <b>Results:</b> Among glycerophospholipids, we demonstrated elevated levels of phosphatidylcholine-ether and lysophosphatidylcholine while decreased levels of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylserine in both cortex and hippocampus of <i>Hexa-/-Neu3-/-</i> mice. In the glycerolipid class, we showed an alleviated level of sphingomyelin in both cortex and hippocampus, but the higher levels of diacylglycerol and triacylglycerol were detected in only the hippocampus of <i>Hexa-/-Neu3-/-</i> mice. The lower level of sterol was also detected in the cortex of <i>Hexa-/-Neu3-/-</i> mice but not in the hippocampus. Histochemical studies showed a decrease in the myelin level and axonal degeneration indicating neuronal pathology in the brain of <i>Hexa-/-Neu3-/-</i> mice. Although glycoconjugate accumulation was evident both in the cortex and hippocampus, we did not detect any changes in the level of cholesterol. <b>Conclusion:</b> Our results indicate that alterations in lipid metabolism and neuropathology, such as demyelination and axonal degeneration, might be related to the dysfunctionality of lipid-related cellular pathways like autophagy. Understanding of brain-specific lipid alterations contributes to evaluating the effectiveness of treatments in <i>Hexa-/-Neu3-/-</i> mice in future studies."

Current experimental gene therapy (GT) approaches with adeno-associated viral vectors (AAVs) still pose safety and efficacy issues, supporting the search for alternative therapeutic strategies. Here we leveraged the lentiviral vector (LV)-mediated intracerebral (IC) GT platform to deliver Hex genes to the CNS and combined this strategy with bone marrow transplantation (BMT) to provide a timely, pervasive, and long-lasting source of the Hex enzyme in the CNS and periphery of SD mice. Combined therapy outperformed individual treatments in terms of lifespan extension and normalization of the neuroinflammatory/neurodegenerative phenotypes of SD mice. These benefits correlated with a time-dependent increase in Hex activity and a remarkable reduction in GM2 storage in brain tissues that single treatments failed to achieve. Our results highlight the synergic mode of action of LV-mediated IC GT and BMT, clarify the contribution of treatments to the therapeutic outcome, and inform on the realistic threshold of corrective enzymatic activity. These results have important implications for interpretation of ongoing experimental therapies and for design of more effective treatment strategies for GM2 gangliosidosis."

An open-label, multicenter, phase II study was conducted in 8 pediatric subjects <5 years of age with MPS VII. Subjects received the recombinant human β-glucuronidase vestronidase alfa 4 mg/kg by intravenous infusion every other week for 48 weeks (treatment period). Those who completed the 48-week treatment were offered to continue treatment with vestronidase alfa 4 mg/kg for up to 240 weeks or until withdrawal of consent, discontinuation, or study termination (continuation period). The level of GAG excreted in urine (uGAG) above normal has been shown to correlate with disease severity and clinical outcomes in MPS diseases. Therefore, the primary efficacy endpoint of this study was to determine the mean percentage change in uGAG DS excretion from baseline to week 48. Statistically significant reductions in uGAG DS from baseline were observed at each visit (p < 0.0001), with a least square mean (standard error) percentage change of -60% (6.6) at week 4 (first post-baseline assessment) and -61% (6.41) at week 48 (final assessment during treatment period). Secondary efficacy endpoints included change from baseline to week 48 in growth and hepatosplenomegaly. Positive trends were observed toward increased standing height Z-score (mean [standard deviation] at baseline, -2.630 [1.17], n = 8; at week 48, -2.045 [0.27], n = 7) and growth velocity (mean [SD] Z-score at baseline, -2.59 [1.49], n = 4; at week 48, -0.39 [2.10], n = 4; p = 0.27). Hepatomegaly was resolved in 3 of 3 subjects assessed by ultrasound and in 5 of 6 subjects assessed by physical examination; splenomegaly was resolved in 1 of 3 subjects assessed by ultrasound and in 2 of 2 subjects assessed by physical examination. There were no new safety signals identified during this study. Mild-to-moderate infusion-associated reactions occurred in 4 (50%) subjects. In conclusion, long-term vestronidase alfa treatment demonstrated a rapid and sustained reduction in uGAGs, maintained growth, and improved hepatosplenomegaly in pediatric subjects with MPS VII <5 years of age.

    "abstract": "Lysosomal network abnormalities are an increasingly recognised feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD), which appear early and are progressive in nature. Sandhoff disease and Tay-Sachs disease (neurological lysosomal storage diseases caused by mutations in genes that code for critical subunits of β-hexosaminidase) result in accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) and related proteolytic fragments in the brain. However, experiments that determine whether mutations in genes that code for β-hexosaminidase are risk factors for AD are currently lacking. To determine the relationship between β-hexosaminidase and AD, we investigated whether a heterozygous deletion of <i>Hexb</i>, the gene that encodes the beta subunit of β-hexosaminidase, modifies the behavioural phenotype and appearance of disease lesions in <i>App</i> <sup><i>NL-G-F/NL-G-F</i></sup> <i>(App</i> <sup><i>KI/KI</i></sup> <i>)</i> mice. <i>App</i> <sup><i>KI/KI</i></sup> and <i>Hexb</i> <sup><i>+/-</i></sup> mice were crossed and evaluated in a behavioural test battery. Neuropathological hallmarks of AD and ganglioside levels in the brain were also examined. Heterozygosity of <i>Hexb</i> in <i>App</i> <sup><i>KI/KI</i></sup> mice reduced learning flexibility during the Reversal Phase of the Morris water maze. Contrary to expectation, heterozygosity of <i>Hexb</i> caused a small but significant decrease in amyloid beta deposition and an increase in the microglial marker IBA1 that was region- and age-specific. <i>Hexb</i> heterozygosity caused detectable changes in the brain and in the behaviour of an AD model mouse, consistent with previous reports that described a biochemical relationship between HEXB and AD. This study reveals that the lysosomal enzyme gene <i>Hexb</i> is not haplosufficient in the mouse AD brain."

Patient TSD-001 was treated at 30 months with an equimolar mix of AAVrh8-HEXA and AAVrh8-HEXB administered intrathecally (i.t.), with 75% of the total dose (1 × 10<sup>14</sup> vector genomes (vg)) in the cisterna magna and 25% at the thoracolumbar junction. Patient TSD-002 was treated at 7 months by combined bilateral thalamic (1.5 × 10<sup>12</sup> vg per thalamus) and i.t. infusion (3.9 × 10<sup>13</sup> vg). Both patients were immunosuppressed. Injection procedures were well tolerated, with no vector-related adverse events (AEs) to date. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) HexA activity increased from baseline and remained stable in both patients. TSD-002 showed disease stabilization by 3 months after injection with ongoing myelination, a temporary deviation from the natural history of infantile TSD, but disease progression was evident at 6 months after treatment. TSD-001 remains seizure-free at 5 years of age on the same anticonvulsant therapy as before therapy. TSD-002 developed anticonvulsant-responsive seizures at 2 years of age. This study provides early safety and proof-of-concept data in humans for treatment of patients with TSD by AAV gene therapy."

The patient was followed up in the outpatient clinic of Pediatric Cardiology. The abdominal ultrasonography showed pelvicalyceal ectasia; bilateral grade V VUR in voiding cystourethrography was found. This coexistence has not been previously reported. This case emphasizes that abnormalities in the neurological examination of cardiac postsurgical patients should not be underestimated because the opportunity to diagnose inborn errors of metabolism could be missed."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by glycosphingolipid accumulation and progressive damage across multiple organ systems. Due to its heterogeneous presentation, the condition is likely significantly underdiagnosed. Several approaches, including provider education efforts and newborn screening, have attempted to address underdiagnosis of FD across the age spectrum, with limited success. Artificial intelligence (AI) methods present another option for improving diagnosis. These methods isolate common health history patterns among patients using longitudinal real-world data, and can be particularly useful when patients experience nonspecific, heterogeneous symptoms over time. In this study, the performance of an AI tool in identifying patients with FD was analyzed. The tool was calibrated using de-identified health record data from a large cohort of nearly 5000 FD patients, and extracted phenotypic patterns from these records. The tool then used this FD pattern information to make individual-level estimates of FD in a testing dataset. Patterns were reviewed and confirmed with medical experts. The AI tool demonstrated strong analytic performance in identifying FD patients. In out-of-sample testing, it achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.82. Strong performance was maintained when testing on male-only and female-only cohorts, with AUROCs of 0.83 and 0.82 respectively. The tool identified small segments of the population with greatly increased prevalence of FD: in the 1% of the population identified by the tool as at highest risk, FD was 23.9 times more prevalent than in the population overall. The AI algorithm used hundreds of phenotypic signals to make predictions and included both familiar symptoms associated with FD (e.g. renal manifestations) as well as less well-studied characteristics. The AI tool analyzed in this study performed very well in identifying Fabry disease patients using structured medical history data. Performance was maintained in all-male and all-female cohorts, and the phenotypic manifestations of FD highlighted by the tool were reviewed and confirmed by clinical experts in the condition. The platform's analytic performance, transparency, and ability to generate predictions based on existing real-world health data may allow it to contribute to reducing persistent underdiagnosis of Fabry disease."

Prior to the development of this programme, the British healthcare system only provided Tay Sachs' screening for this community, leaving them at higher risk of having a child with a serious autosomal recessive disease. The Jnetics screening programme is promoted through community and social media campaigns, involves educational outreach, a pre-test genetic counselling service by a dedicated NHS-based genetic counsellor, saliva-based DNA testing, comprehensive reporting and, where required, post-test genetic counselling. The charity raises funds to subsidise the screening. In 6 years, the model has been successfully implemented in hospital and community settings and in schools and universities, aiming to reach those pre-conception. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the programme adapted by offering genetic screening virtually and has subsequently expanded in its outreach. Furthermore, the screening panel is currently being expanded to include other conditions increased in the Ashkenazi and also the Sephardi and Mizrahi Jewish communities. An example of innovation and accessibility, providing free screening to all students and disadvantaged individuals, the programme aims to provide a model that can potentially be adopted by other genetically at-risk communities."

    "abstract": "Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff diseases (GM2 gangliosidosis) are autosomal recessive disorders of lysosomal function that cause progressive neurodegeneration in infants and young children. Impaired hydrolysis catalysed by β-hexosaminidase A (HexA) leads to the accumulation of GM2 ganglioside in neuronal lysosomes. Despite the storage phenotype, the role of autophagy and its regulation by mTOR has yet to be explored in the neuropathogenesis. Accordingly, we investigated the effects on autophagy and lysosomal integrity using skin fibroblasts obtained from patients with Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff diseases. Pathological autophagosomes with impaired autophagic flux, an abnormality confirmed by electron microscopy and biochemical studies revealing the accelerated release of mature cathepsins and HexA into the cytosol, indicating increased lysosomal permeability. GM2 fibroblasts showed diminished mTOR signalling with reduced basal mTOR activity. Accordingly, provision of a positive nutrient signal by L-arginine supplementation partially restored mTOR activity and ameliorated the cytopathological abnormalities. Our data provide a novel molecular mechanism underlying GM2 gangliosidosis. Impaired autophagy caused by insufficient lysosomal function might represent a new therapeutic target for these diseases. We contend that the expression of autophagy/lysosome/mTOR-associated molecules may prove useful peripheral biomarkers for facile monitoring of treatment of GM2 gangliosidosis and neurodegenerative disorders that affect the lysosomal function and disrupt autophagy."

The aim of our work was to identify the characteristic brain MRI findings in this presumably underdiagnosed disease. Clinical data and MRI findings from 16 patients (10F/6 M) with LOTS from two centers were independently assessed by two readers and compared to 16 age- and sex-related controls. Lower motor neuron disease (94%), psychiatric symptoms-psychosis (31%), cognitive impairment (38%) and depression (25%)-and symptoms of cerebellar impairment including dysarthria (94%), ataxia (81%) and tremor (69%), were the most common clinical features. On MRI, pontocerebellar atrophy was a constant finding. Compared to controls, LOTS patients had smaller mean middle cerebellar peduncle diameter (p < 0.0001), mean superior cerebellar peduncle diameter (p = 0.0002), mesencephalon sagittal area (p = 0.0002), pons sagittal area (p < 0.0001), and larger 4<sup>th</sup> ventricle transversal diameter (p < 0.0001). Mild corpus callosum thinning (37.5%), mild cortical atrophy (18.8%), and white matter T2 hyperintensities (12.5%) were also present. Given the characteristic clinical course and MRI findings of the pontocerebellar atrophy, late-onset Tay-Sachs disease should be considered in the differential diagnosis of adult-onset cerebellar ataxias."

In this work, we analyzed the effect of umbilical cord blood cell transplantation (UCBCT) and curcumin administration on the course of the disease in a patient with adult TSD. The patient's serum cytokine profile was determined using multiplex analysis. The level of GM<sub>2</sub> gangliosides in plasma was determined using mass spectrometry. The enzymatic activity of HexA in the plasma of the patient was assessed using a fluorescent substrate assay. The HexA α-subunit (HexA) concentration was determined using ELISA. It was shown that both UCBCT and curcumin administration led to a change in the patient's cytokine profile. The UCBCT resulted in an increase in the concentration of HexA in the patient's serum and in an improvement in the patient's neurological status. However, neither UCBCT nor curcumin were able to alter HexA activity and the level of GM<sub>2</sub> in patient's plasma. The data obtained indicate that UCBCT and curcumin administration can alter the immunity of a patient with TSD, reduce the level of inflammatory cytokines and thereby improve the patient's condition."

    "abstract": "Elevated serum chitotriosidase (CHITO) is an indication of macrophage activation, and its capacity have been explored as a marker of inflammation in a number of disease states. For over a decade, CHITO plasma levels have been used by clinicians as a biomarker of inflammation in the lysosomal disease, Gaucher disease, including monitoring response to therapies in patients with Gaucher disease type I. Although it is becoming increasingly recognized that inflammation is a prominent component of many lysosomal diseases, the relation of CHITO levels to disease burden has not been well-characterized in the large majority of lysosomal diseases. Moreover, the role of CHITO in lysosomal diseases that affect the central nervous system (CNS) has not been systematically studied. In this study, one hundred and thirty-four specimens of CSF and serum were collected from 34 patients with lysosomal diseases affecting the CNS. This study included patients with GM1-gangliosidosis, GM2-gangliosidosis, mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS), multiple sulfatase deficiency and Gaucher disease. CHITO levels in the CSF were significantly higher in patients with more rapidly progressing severe neurological impairment: GM1-gangliosidosis vs MPS (<i>p</i> < 0.0001); GM2-gangliosidosis vs MPS (p < 0.0001). CHITO levels were higher in patients with the more severe phenotypes compared to milder phenotypes in GM1-gangliosidosis and GM2-gangliosidosis (serum CHITO in GM1-gangliosidosis infantile vs juvenile <i>p</i> = 0.025; CSF CHITO in Tay-Sachs infantile vs Tay-Sachs late-onset <i>p</i> < 0.0001). Moreover, higher CHITO levels in the CSF were significantly associated with lower cognitive test scores in patients with GM1-gangliosidosis, GM2-gangliosidosis, and MPS (<i>p</i> = 1.12*10<sup>-5</sup>, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.72). Patients with infantile GM1-gangliosidosis showed increasing CSF CHITO over time, suggesting that CSF CHITO reflects disease progression and a possible surrogate endpoint for future clinical trials with infantile GM1-gangliosidosis. In summary, these results support the use of CSF CHITO to diagnose between different disease phenotypes and as a valuable tool for monitoring disease progression in patients. These results necessitate the inclusion of CHITO as an exploratory biomarker for clinical trials."

    "abstract": "Globally, about 6% of children are born with a serious birth defect of genetic or partially genetic origin. Carrier screening or testing is one way to identify couples at increased risk of having a child with an autosomal recessive condition. The most common autosomal recessive conditions are thalassaemia, sickle cell disease, cystic fibrosis and Tay-Sachs disease, with higher carrier rates in high-risk populations of specific ancestral backgrounds. Identifying and counselling couples at genetic risk of the conditions before pregnancy enables them to make fully informed reproductive decisions, with some of these choices not being available if testing is only offered in an antenatal setting. This is an update of a previously published review. To assess the effectiveness of systematic preconception genetic risk assessment to enable autonomous reproductive choice and to improve reproductive outcomes in women and their partners who are both identified as carriers of thalassaemia, sickle cell disease, cystic fibrosis and Tay-Sachs disease in healthcare settings when compared to usual care. We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Trials Registers. Date of latest search of the registers: 04 August 2021. In addition, we searched for all relevant trials from 1970 (or the date at which the database was first available if after 1970) to date using electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO), clinical trial databases (National Institutes of Health, Clinical Trials Search portal of the World Health Organization, metaRegister of controlled clinical trials), and hand searching of key journals and conference abstract books from 1998 to date (European Journal of Human Genetics, Genetics in Medicine, Journal of Community Genetics). We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles, reviews and guidelines and also contacted subject experts in the field to request any unpublished or other published trials. Date of latest search of all these sources: 25 June 2021. SELECTION CRITERIA: Any randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs (published or unpublished) comparing reproductive outcomes of systematic preconception genetic risk assessment for thalassaemia, sickle cell disease, cystic fibrosis and Tay-Sachs disease when compared to usual care. We identified 37 papers, describing 22 unique trials which were potentially eligible for inclusion in the review. However, after assessment, we found no RCTs of preconception genetic risk assessment for thalassaemia, sickle cell disease, cystic fibrosis and Tay-Sachs disease. No RCTs of preconception genetic risk assessment for thalassaemia, sickle cell disease, cystic fibrosis and Tay-Sachs disease are included. A trial identified earlier has published its results and has subsequently been listed as excluded in this review. As there are no RCTs of preconception genetic risk assessment for thalassaemia, sickle cell disease, cystic fibrosis, or Tay-Sachs disease included in either the earlier or current versions of this review, we recommend considering potential non-RCTs studies (for example prospective cohorts or before-and-after studies) for future reviews. While RCTs are desirable to inform evidence-based practice and robust recommendations, the ethical, legal and social implications associated with using this trial design to evaluate the implementation of preconception genetic risk assessment involving carrier testing and reproductive autonomy must also be considered. In addition, rather than focusing on single gene-by-gene carrier testing for specific autosomal-recessive conditions as the intervention being evaluated, preconception expanded genetic screening should also be included in future searches as this has received much attention in recent years as a more pragmatic strategy. The research evidence for current international policy recommendations is limited to non-randomised studies."

Sphingolipidosis, which is a subgroup of LSDs, is resulted from mutations in the coding genes of specific enzymes of sphingolipid hydrolases. The current study aimed to provide additional knowledge on the genotype of sphingolipidoses disease among Iranian patients affected by the disease. In this research, we studied 68 unrelated Iranian patients diagnosed with one kind of sphingolipidoses from 2014 to 2019. Thereafter, genomic DNA was isolated from their peripheral blood leukocytes samples in EDTA in terms of the manufacturer's protocol. All the coding exons and exon-intron boundaries of the related genes were sequenced and then analyzed using the NCBI database. Finally, they were reviewed using some databases such as the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD) and ClinVar ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinva ). By studying 22 MLD patients, 18 different variations of the ARSA gene were found, one of which was new including, named as c.472 T > G p. (Cys158Gly). Out of 15 Sandhoff disease (SD) patients, 11 different variations of the HEXB gene were found. Correspondingly, the c.1083-2delA was not reported earlier. By investigating 21 Iranian patients with Tay-Sachs disease (TSD), one new variant was found as c.622delG. The study of 10 Niemann-Pick disease A/B (NPDA/B (patients has led to the identification of 9 different SMPD1 gene variations, among which 3 variations were novel mutations. The results of the present study can be expanded to the genotypic spectrum of Iranian patients with MLD, SD, TSD, and NPD diseases and also used to innovate more effective methods for the detection of genetic carriers as well as diagnosing and counseling of Iranian patients affected with these disorders."

    "abstract": "GM2 gangliosidosis is a neurodegenerative, lysosomal storage disease caused by the deficiency of β-hexosaminidase A enzyme (Hex A), an α/β-subunit heterodimer. A novel variant of the human hexosaminidase α-subunit, coded by HEX M, has previously been shown to form a stable homodimer, Hex M, that hydrolyzes GM2 gangliosides (GM2) in vivo. The current study assessed the efficacy of intravenous (IV) delivery of a self-complementary adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (scAAV9) vector incorporating the HEXM transgene, scAAV9/HEXM, including the outcomes based on the dosages provided to the Sandhoff (SD) mice. Six-week-old SD mice were injected with either 2.5E+12 vector genomes (low dose, LD) or 1.0E+13 vg (high dose, HD). We hypothesized that when examining the dosage comparison for scAAV9/HEXM in adult SD mice, the HD group would have more beneficial outcomes than the LD cohort. Assessments included survival, behavioral outcomes, vector biodistribution, and enzyme activity within the central nervous system. Toxicity was observed in the HD cohort, with 8 of 14 mice dying within one month of the injection. As compared to untreated SD mice, which have typical survival of 16 weeks, the LD cohort and the remaining HD mice had a significant survival benefit with an average/median survival of 40.6/34.5 and 55.9/56.7 weeks, respectively. Significant behavioral, biochemical and molecular benefits were also observed. The second aim of the study was to investigate the effects of IV mannitol infusions on the biodistribution of the LD scAAV9/HEXM vector and the survival of the SD mice. Increases in both the biodistribution of the vector as well as the survival benefit (average/median of 41.6/49.3 weeks) were observed. These results demonstrate the potential benefit and critical limitations of the treatment of GM2 gangliosidosis using IV delivered AAV vectors."

A study found a high allelic frequency for repeat expansions in the <i>RFC1</i> gene, a cause of cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy, and vestibular areflexia syndrome, which presents exclusively in adults. This implies that autosomal recessive etiologies of adult-onset cerebellar ataxias may be more common than previously thought. Adult-onset cerebellar ataxias are commonly caused by mutations inherited in either an autosomal dominant or X-linked pattern, as most autosomal recessive mutations cause disease at earlier ages. However, some autosomal recessive etiologies such as late-onset Tay-Sachs disease, very late-onset Friedreich ataxia, and autosomal recessive spastic ataxia of Charlevoix-Saguenay emerge in adulthood, with age at presentation influencing the progression and clinical signs of the disease. This review will cover the genetics, clinical presentation, and necessary diagnostic steps required to identify 3 causes of autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia that manifest differently in adults vs children."

    "abstract": "The gangliosidoses are a family of neurodegenerative lysosomal storage diseases that have recently seen promising advances in gene therapy. White matter deficits are well established components of gangliosidosis pathology that are now receiving more attention because they are partially refractory to correction by gene therapy. After a brief synopsis of normal myelinogenesis, this review outlines current viewpoints on the origin of white matter deficits in the gangliosidoses and potential obstacles to treating them effectively by gene therapy. Dysmyelinogenesis (failure of myelin sheaths to form properly) is proposed as the predominant contributor to white matter pathology, but precise mechanistic details are not well understood. The involvement of neuronal storage deficits may extend beyond secondary demyelination (destruction of myelin due to axonal loss) and contribute to dysmyelinogenesis. Preclinical studies in animal models of the gangliosidoses have substantially improved lifespan and quality of life, leading to the initiation of several clinical trials. However, improvement of white matter pathology has lagged behind other metrics and few evidence-based explanations have been proposed to date. Research groups in the field are encouraged to include myelin-specific investigations in future gene therapy work to address this gap in knowledge."

TSD naturally occurs in Jacob sheep is the only experimental model of TSD. TSD in sheep recapitulates neurologic features similar to juvenile onset and late onset TSD patients. Due to the paucity of human literature on pathology of TSD, a better natural history in the sheep TSD brain, which is on the same order of magnitude as a child's, is necessary for evaluating therapy and characterizing the pathological events that occur. To provide clinicians and researchers with a clearer understanding of longitudinal pathology in patients, we compare spectrum of clinical signs and brain pathology in mildly symptomatic (3-months), moderately symptomatic (6-months), or severely affected TSD sheep (humane endpoint at ~9-months of age). Increased GM2 ganglioside in the CSF of TSD sheep and a TSD specific biomarker on MRS (taurine) correlate with disease severity. Microglial activation and reactive astrocytes were observed globally on histopathology in TSD sheep with a widespread reduction in oligodendrocyte density. Myelination is reduced primarily in the forebrain illustrated by loss of white matter on MRI. GM2 and GM3 ganglioside were increased and distributed differently in various tissues. The study of TSD in the sheep model provides a natural history to shed light on the pathophysiology of TSD, which is of utmost importance due to novel therapeutics being assessed in human patients."

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations showed that two mutants, P25S and W485R, experienced an increase in structural flexibility compared to the native protein. Particularly, there was a decrease in the overall number and frequencies of hydrogen bonds for the mutants compared to the wildtype. MM/GBSA calculations were performed to help assess the change in binding affinity between the wildtype and mutant structures and a mechanism-based inhibitor, NGT, which is known to help increase the residual activity of HexA. Both of the mutants experienced a decrease in the binding affinity from -23.8 kcal/mol in wildtype to -20.9 and -18.7 kcal/mol for the P25S and W485R variants of HexA, respectively."

Cystic fibrosis was the first medical condition for which panethnic screening was recommended, followed by spinal muscular atrophy. Next-generation sequencing allows low cost and high throughput identification of sequence variants across many genes simultaneously. Since the phrase \"expanded carrier screening\" is nonspecific, there is a need to define carrier screening processes in a way that will allow equitable opportunity for patients to learn their reproductive risks using next-generation sequencing technology. An improved understanding of this risk allows patients to make informed reproductive decisions. Reproductive decision making is the established metric for clinical utility of population-based carrier screening. Furthermore, standardization of the screening approach will facilitate testing consistency. This practice resource reviews the current status of carrier screening, provides answers to some of the emerging questions, and recommends a consistent and equitable approach for offering carrier screening to all individuals during pregnancy or preconception."

    "abstract": "Our study aimed to quantify structural changes in relation to metabolic abnormalities in the cerebellum, thalamus, and parietal cortex of patients with late-onset GM2-gangliosidosis (LOGG), which encompasses late-onset Tay-Sachs disease (LOTS) and Sandhoff disease (LOSD). We enrolled 10 patients with LOGG (7 LOTS, 3 LOSD) who underwent a neurological assessment battery and 7 age-matched controls. Structural MRI and MRS were performed on a 3 T scanner. Structural volumes were obtained from FreeSurfer and normalized by total intracranial volume. Quantified metabolites included N-acetylaspartate (NAA), choline (Cho), myo-inositol (mI), creatine (Cr), and combined glutamate-glutamine (Glx). Metabolic concentrations were corrected for partial volume effects. Structural analyses revealed significant cerebellar atrophy in the LOGG cohort, which was primarily driven by LOTS patients. NAA was lower and mI higher in LOGG, but this was also significantly driven by the LOTS patients. Clinical ataxia deficits (via the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia) were associated with neuronal injury (via NAA), neuroinflammation (via mI), and volumetric atrophy in the cerebellum. The decrease of NAA in the cerebellum suggests that, in addition to cerebellar atrophy, there is ongoing impaired neuronal function and/or loss, while an increase in mI indicates possible neuroinflammation in LOGG (more so within the LOTS subvariant). Quantifying cerebellar atrophy in relation to neurometabolic differences in LOGG may lead to improvements in assessing disease severity, progression, and pharmacological efficacy. Lastly, additional neuroimaging studies in LOGG are required to contrast LOTS and LOSD more accurately."

    "title": "Investigating Immune Responses to the scAAV9-<i>HEXM</i> Gene Therapy Treatment in Tay-Sachs Disease and Sandhoff Disease Mouse Models.",
    "abstract": "GM2 gangliosidosis disorders are a group of neurodegenerative diseases that result from a functional deficiency of the enzyme β-hexosaminidase A (HexA). HexA consists of an α- and β-subunit; a deficiency in either subunit results in Tay-Sachs Disease (TSD) or Sandhoff Disease (SD), respectively. Viral vector gene transfer is viewed as a potential method of treating these diseases. A recently constructed isoenzyme to HexA, called HexM, has the ability to effectively catabolize GM2 gangliosides in vivo. Previous gene transfer studies have revealed that the scAAV9-<i>HEXM</i> treatment can improve survival in the murine SD model. However, it is speculated that this treatment could elicit an immune response to the carrier capsid and \"non-self\"-expressed transgene. This study was designed to assess the immunocompetence of TSD and SD mice, and test the immune response to the scAAV9-<i>HEXM</i> gene transfer. HexM vector-treated mice developed a significant anti-HexM T cell response and antibody response. This study confirms that TSD and SD mouse models are immunocompetent, and that gene transfer expression can create an immune response in these mice. These mouse models could be utilized for investigating methods of mitigating immune responses to gene transfer-expressed \"non-self\" proteins, and potentially improve treatment efficacy."

    "abstract": "The majority of patients affected with lysosomal storage disorders (LSD) exhibit neurological symptoms. For mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIC (MPSIIIC), the major burdens are progressive and severe neuropsychiatric problems and dementia, primarily thought to stem from neurodegeneration. Using the MPSIIIC mouse model, we studied whether clinical manifestations preceding massive neurodegeneration arise from synaptic dysfunction. Reduced levels or abnormal distribution of multiple synaptic proteins were revealed in cultured hippocampal and CA1 pyramidal MPSIIIC neurons. These defects were rescued by virus-mediated gene correction. Dendritic spines were reduced in pyramidal neurons of mouse models of MPSIIIC and other (Tay-Sachs, sialidosis) LSD as early as at P10. MPSIIIC neurons also presented alterations in frequency and amplitude of miniature excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic currents, sparse synaptic vesicles, reduced postsynaptic densities, disorganized microtubule networks, and partially impaired axonal transport of synaptic proteins. Furthermore, postsynaptic densities were reduced in postmortem cortices of human MPS patients, suggesting that the pathology is a common hallmark for neurological LSD. Together, our results demonstrate that lysosomal storage defects cause early alterations in synaptic structure and abnormalities in neurotransmission originating from impaired synaptic vesicular transport, and they suggest that synaptic defects could be targeted to treat behavioral and cognitive defects in neurological LSD patients."

    "abstract": "Gangliosidoses are inherited lysosomal storage disorders caused by reduced or absent activity of either a lysosomal enzyme involved in ganglioside catabolism, or an activator protein required for the proper activity of a ganglioside hydrolase, which results in the intra-lysosomal accumulation of undegraded metabolites. We hereby describe morphological, ultrastructural, biochemical and genetic features of GM2 gangliosidosis in three captive bred wild boar littermates. The piglets were kept in a partially-free range farm and presented progressive neurological signs, starting at 6 months of age. Animals were euthanized at approximately one year of age due to their poor conditions. Neuropathogens were excluded as a possible cause of the signs. Gross examination showed a reduction of cerebral and cerebellar consistency. Central (CNS) and peripheral (PNS) nervous system neurons were enlarged and foamy, with severe and diffuse cytoplasmic vacuolization. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of CNS neurons demonstrated numerous lysosomes, filled by parallel or concentric layers of membranous electron-dense material, defined as membranous cytoplasmic bodies (MCB). Biochemical composition of gangliosides analysis from CNS revealed accumulation of GM2 ganglioside; furthermore, Hex A enzyme activity was less than 1% compared to control animals. These data confirmed the diagnosis of GM2 gangliosidosis. Genetic analysis identified, at a homozygous level, the presence of a missense nucleotide variant c.1495C > T (p Arg499Cys) in the hexosaminidase subunit alpha gene (HEXA), located within the GH20 hexosaminidase superfamily domain of the encoded protein. This specific HEXA variant is known to be pathogenic and associated with Tay-Sachs disease in humans, but has never been identified in other animal species. This is the first report of a HEXA gene associated Tay-Sachs disease in wild boars and provides a comprehensive description of a novel spontaneous animal model for this lysosomal storage disease."

    "abstract": "Tay-Sachs disease and Sandhoff disease are severe hereditary neurodegenerative disorders caused by a deficiency of β-hexosaminidase A (HexA) enzyme, which results in the accumulation of GM2 gangliosides in the nervous system cells. In this work, we analyzed the efficacy and safety of cell-mediated gene therapy for Sandhoff disease and Sandhoff disease using a bicistronic lentiviral vector encoding cDNA of HexA α- and β-subunit genes separated by the nucleotide sequence of a P2A peptide (HEXA-HEXB). The functionality of the bicistronic construct containing the HEXA-HEXB genetic cassette was analyzed in a culture of HEK293T cells and human umbilical cord blood mononuclear cells (hUCBMCs). Our results showed that the enzymatic activity of HexA in the conditioned medium harvested from genetically modified HEK293T-HEXA-HEXB and hUCBMCs-HEXA-HEXB was increased by 23 and 8 times, respectively, compared with the conditioned medium of native cells. Western blot analysis showed that hUCBMCs-HEXA-HEXB secreted both completely separated HEXA and HEXB proteins, and an uncleaved protein containing HEXA + HEXB linked by the P2A peptide. Intravenous injection of genetically modified hUCBMCs-HEXA-HEXB to laboratory Wistar rats was carried out, and the HexA enzymatic activity in the blood plasma of experimental animals, as well as the number of live cells of immune system organs (spleen, thymus, bone marrow, lymph nodes) were determined. A significant increase in the enzymatic activity of HexA in the blood plasma of laboratory rats on days 6 and 9 (by 2.5 and 3 times, respectively) after the administration of hUCBMCs-HEXA-HEXB was shown. At the same time, the number of live cells in the studied organs remained unchanged. Thus, the functionality of the bicistronic genetic construct encoding cDNA of the HEXA and HEXB genes separated by the nucleotide sequence of the P2A peptide was shown in vitro and in vivo. We hypothesize that due to the natural ability of hUCBMCs to overcome biological barriers, such a strategy can restore the activity of the missing enzyme in the central nervous system of patients with GM2 gangliosidoses. Based on the obtained data, it can be concluded that intravenous administration of hUCBMCs with HexA overexpression is a promising method of the therapy for GM2 gangliosidoses. The animal protocol was approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of the Kazan Federal University (No. 23) on June 30, 2020."

    "title": "Therapeutic Uses of Bacterial Subunit Toxins.",
    "abstract": "The B subunit pentamer verotoxin (VT aka Shiga toxin-Stx) binding to its cellular glycosphingolipid (GSL) receptor, globotriaosyl ceramide (Gb<sub>3</sub>) mediates internalization and the subsequent receptor mediated retrograde intracellular traffic of the AB5 subunit holotoxin to the endoplasmic reticulum. Subunit separation and cytosolic A subunit transit via the ER retrotranslocon as a misfolded protein mimic, then inhibits protein synthesis to kill cells, which can cause hemolytic uremic syndrome clinically. This represents one of the most studied systems of prokaryotic hijacking of eukaryotic biology. Similarly, the interaction of cholera AB5 toxin with its GSL receptor, GM1 ganglioside, is the key component of the gastrointestinal pathogenesis of cholera and follows the same retrograde transport pathway for A subunit cytosol access. Although both VT and CT are the cause of major pathology worldwide, the toxin-receptor interaction is itself being manipulated to generate new approaches to control, rather than cause, disease. This arena comprises two areas: anti neoplasia, and protein misfolding diseases. CT/CTB subunit immunomodulatory function and anti-cancer toxin immunoconjugates will not be considered here. In the verotoxin case, it is clear that Gb<sub>3</sub> (and VT targeting) is upregulated in many human cancers and that there is a relationship between GSL expression and cancer drug resistance. While both verotoxin and cholera toxin similarly hijack the intracellular ERAD quality control system of nascent protein folding, the more widespread cell expression of GM1 makes cholera the toxin of choice as the means to more widely utilise ERAD targeting to ameliorate genetic diseases of protein misfolding. Gb<sub>3</sub> is primarily expressed in human renal tissue. Glomerular endothelial cells are the primary VT target but Gb<sub>3</sub> is expressed in other endothelial beds, notably brain endothelial cells which can mediate the encephalopathy primarily associated with VT2-producing <i>E. coli</i> infection. The Gb<sub>3</sub> levels can be regulated by cytokines released during EHEC infection, which complicate pathogenesis. Significantly Gb<sub>3</sub> is upregulated in the neovasculature of many tumours, irrespective of tumour Gb<sub>3</sub> status. Gb<sub>3</sub> is markedly increased in pancreatic, ovarian, breast, testicular, renal, astrocytic, gastric, colorectal, cervical, sarcoma and meningeal cancer relative to the normal tissue. VT has been shown to be effective in mouse xenograft models of renal, astrocytoma, ovarian, colorectal, meningioma, and breast cancer. These studies are herein reviewed. Both CT and VT (and several other bacterial toxins) access the cell cytosol via cell surface ->ER transport. Once in the ER they interface with the protein folding homeostatic quality control pathway of the cell -ERAD, (ER associated degradation), which ensures that only correctly folded nascent proteins are allowed to progress to their cellular destinations. Misfolded proteins are translocated through the ER membrane and degraded by cytosolic proteosome. VT and CT A subunits have a C terminal misfolded protein mimic sequence to hijack this transporter to enter the cytosol. This interface between exogenous toxin and genetically encoded endogenous mutant misfolded proteins, provides a new therapeutic basis for the treatment of such genetic diseases, e.g., Cystic fibrosis, Gaucher disease, Krabbe disease, Fabry disease, Tay-Sachs disease and many more. Studies showing the efficacy of this approach in animal models of such diseases are presented."

    "abstract": "A major challenge for cell-based non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) is to distinguish individual presumptive fetal cells from maternal cells in female pregnancies. We have sought a rapid, robust, versatile, and low-cost next-generation sequencing method to facilitate this process. Toward this goal, single isolated cells underwent whole genome amplification prior to genotyping. Multiple highly polymorphic genomic regions (including HLA-A and HLA-B) with 10-20 very informative single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within a 200 bp interval were amplified with a modified method based on other publications. To enhance the power of cell identification, approximately 40 Human Identification SNP (Applied Biosystems) test amplicons were also utilized. Using SNP results to compare to sex chromosome data from NGS as a reliable standard, the true positive rate for genotyping was 83.4%, true negative 6.6%, false positive 3.3%, and false negative 6.6%. These results would not be sufficient for clinical diagnosis, but they demonstrate the general validity of the approach and suggest that deeper genotyping of single cells could be completely reliable. A paternal DNA sample is not required using this method. The assay also successfully detected pathogenic variants causing Tay Sachs disease, cystic fibrosis, and hemoglobinopathies in single lymphoblastoid cells, and disease-causing variants in three cell-based NIPT cases. This method could be applicable for any monogenic diagnosis."

    "abstract": "Voluntary rapid eye movements (saccades) redirect the fovea toward objects of visual interest. The saccadic system can be considered as a dual-mode system: in one mode the eye is fixating, in the other it is making a saccade. In this review, we consider two examples of dysfunctional saccades, interrupted saccades in late-onset Tay-Sachs disease and gaze-position dependent opsoclonus after concussion, which fail to properly shift between fixation and saccade modes. Insights and benefits gained from bi-directional collaborative exchange between clinical and basic scientists are emphasized. In the case of interrupted saccades, existing mathematical models were sufficiently detailed to provide support for the cause of interrupted saccades. In the case of gaze-position dependent opsoclonus, existing models could not explain the behavior, but further development provided a reasonable hypothesis for the mechanism underlying the behavior. Collaboration between clinical and basic science is a rich source of progress for developing biologically plausible models and understanding neurological disease. Approaching a clinical problem with a specific hypothesis (model) in mind often prompts new experimental tests and provides insights into basic mechanisms."

It is caused by genetic variations in the HEXA gene leading to a deficiency of β hexosaminidase A (HEXA) isoenzyme activity. This study aimed to identify causative gene variants in 3 unrelated consanguineous families presented with TSD from Pakistan and Morocco. Detailed clinical investigations were carried out on probands in 3 unrelated consanguineous families of Pakistani and Moroccan origin. Targeted gene sequencing and Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) were performed for variant identification. Candidate variants were checked for co-segregation with the phenotype using Sanger sequencing. Public databases including ExAC, GnomAD, dbSNP and the 1,000 Genome Project were searched to determine frequencies of the alleles. Conservation of the missense variants was ensured by aligning orthologous protein sequences from diverse vertebrate species. We report on 3 children presented with Tay-Sachs Disease. The β hexosaminidaseA enzyme activity was reduced in the Pakistani patient in one of the pedigrees. Genetic testing revealed 2 novel homozygous variants (p.Asp386Alafs*13 and p.Trp266Gly) in the gene HEXA in Pakistani and Moroccan patients respectively.The third family of Pakistani origin revealed a previously reported variant (p.Tyr427Ilefs*5) in HEXA. p.Tyr427Ilefs*5 is the most commonly occurring pathogenic variationin Ashkenazi but was not reported in Pakistani population. Our study further expands the ethnic and mutational spectrum of Tay-Sachs disease emphasizing the usefulness of WES as a powerful diagnostic tool where enzymatic activity is not performed for Tay-Sachs disease. The study recommends targeted screening for these mutations (p.Tyr427Ilefs5) for cost effective testing of TSD patients. Further, the study would assist in carrier testing and prenatal diagnosis of the affected families."

GM2 activator protein deficiency is an ultra-rare form of GM2 gangliosidosis. To date, 16 cases of GM2 activator protein deficiency have been reported in the literature, and among them, 11 cases were the infantile form of the disease. Here we report the first two patients from Turkey with the infantile form of the disease with a novel likely pathogenic variant. A boy of eight months old presented to the metabolic department with very mild neurological deterioration, although he had achieved early developmental milestones at the appropriate time. The parents also had a daughter who had lost skills progressively before one year of age. The boy was evaluated and bilateral cherry-red spots were found with no abnormality in either metabolic screening including β-hexosaminidase or cranial magnetic resonance imaging. A novel homozygous likely pathogenic variant in <i>GM2A</i> was detected in a next-generation sequence panel revealing GM2 activator protein deficiency. His sister was investigated after he was diagnosed with GM2 activator deficiency and it was found that she had the same variant as her brother. This case report emphasizes that in the event of normal β-hexosaminidase activity, GM2 activator protein deficiency could be underdiagnosed, and further molecular analysis should be performed. To the best of our knowledge, this boy is one of the youngest patient diagnosed with very mild symptoms. With this novel pathogenic variant, these patients have expanded the mutation spectrum of GM2 activator protein deficiency."

As HEXA normally functions to degrade the protein GM2-ganglioside in lysosomes, decreased levels of HEXAcauses an accumulation of the protein and leads to neurological toxicity. Typical clinical manifestations of TSD include neurodevelopmental regression, muscle weakness, hypotonia, hyperreflexia, ataxia, seizures, and other neurological symptoms. It is quite rare in Asian populations, wherein only two cases have been reported in Korea to date. Clinical records, radiological assessments, and laboratory findings, such as plasma hexosaminidase assay and HEXA analysis, were extracted from the medical records of three (1 male and 2 female) independent Korean children with infantile form of Tay-Sachs disease. All three children presented with neurodevelopmental regression and strabismus at around 8 months of age. Presence of cherry-red spots in the macula led to conduction of biochemical and genetic studies for TSD confirmation. The plasma hexosaminidase assay revealed decreased HEXA activity and low to normal total hexosaminidase activity. Similarly, genetic analysis revealed 4 variants from 6 alleles, including 2 previously reported and 2 novel variants, in the HEXA gene.

Indeed, results acquired demonstrated a profound distinctiveness between the GM1T2 and HC profiles. Additionally, employment of a genome-scale network model of human metabolism provided evidence that perturbations to propanoate, ethanol, amino-sugar, aspartate, seleno-amino acid, glutathione and alanine metabolism, fatty acid biosynthesis, and most especially branched-chain amino acid degradation (<i>p</i> = 10<sup>-12</sup>-10<sup>-5</sup>) were the most important topologically-highlighted dysregulated pathways contributing towards GM1T2 disease pathology. Quantitative metabolite set enrichment analysis revealed that pathological locations associated with these dysfunctions were in the order fibroblasts > Golgi apparatus > mitochondria > spleen ≈ skeletal muscle ≈ muscle in general. In conclusion, results acquired demonstrated marked metabolic imbalances and alterations to energy demand, which are consistent with GM1T2 disease pathogenesis mechanisms."

In this work, DyOH was selected as fluorophore scaffolds to synthesize probe Hex-1 for detection of Hexs with good water solubility, high specificity, large stokes shift and quick response. Hex-1 can sensitively detect Hexs with the low detection limit (0.025 mU mL<sup>-1</sup>) in vitro by \"naked eye\" due to superior spectral properties of DyOH. Furthermore, Hex-1 was not only employed for imaging Hexs in living cells with low toxicity, but also successfully applied to evaluate the fluctuation of Hexs activity during drug induced kindey injury in living HK-2 cells. These results indicated that Hex-1 could be used as a potential image tool to further explore the pathogenesis of kidney disease and cancer."

When acetyl-dl-leucine and acetyl-l-leucine were administered pre-symptomatically to <i>Npc1<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice, both treatments delayed disease progression and extended life span, whereas acetyl-d-leucine did not. These data are consistent with acetyl-l-leucine being the neuroprotective enantiomer. Altered glucose and antioxidant metabolism were implicated as one of the potential mechanisms of action of the l-enantiomer in <i>Npc1<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice. When the standard of care drug miglustat and acetyl-dl-leucine were used in combination significant synergy resulted. In agreement with these pre-clinical data, when Niemann-Pick disease type C1 patients were evaluated after 12 months of acetyl-dl-leucine treatment, rates of disease progression were slowed, with stabilization or improvement in multiple neurological domains. A beneficial effect of acetyl-dl-leucine on gait was also observed in this study in a mouse model of GM2 gangliosidosis (Sandhoff disease) and in Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff disease patients in individual-cases of off-label-use.

These sheep have recently attracted medical interest due to the observation of a genetic disorder in the breed that can be used as an animal model of Tay-Sachs disease (TSD). This study aims to detect mutations in the Hexosaminidase A gene in Jacob sheep based on sequence analysis of the 284-bp fragment situated between exon 11 and intron 11 of the gene, a target sequence for site-specific mutation. This is the first study that has investigated Jacob sheep in Bulgaria for gene-specific mutations. A total of 20 blood samples were collected from Jacob sheep from the Rhodope Mountains. DNA was isolated from these samples, and a specific 284-bp fragment was amplified. The amplified products were purified using a polymerase chain reaction purification kit and sequenced in both directions. Target sequences were successfully amplified from all 20 investigated sheep. Sequence analysis did not show the homozygous, recessive, missense (G-to-C transition) mutation at nucleotide position 1330 (G1330→C) in exon 11, demonstrating that all of these sheep were a normal genotype (wild-type). Jacob sheep are considered a potentially useful animal model in advancing the understanding of pathogenesis and developing potential therapies for orphan diseases, such as those characterized by mutant GM2 gangliosides. The clinical and biochemical features of the Jacob sheep model of TSD represent well the human classical late-infantile form of this disorder, indicating that the model can serve as a possible new research tool for further study of the pathogenesis and treatment of TSD."

At 11 months old, our patient had an afebrile seizure. At 14 months, he showed developmental stagnation and an increase in the frequency of epileptic seizures. Magnetic resonance imaging (T2-weighted images) showed high signal intensities in the thalamus bilaterally, and in the head of the caudate nucleus. Serum β-hexosaminidase enzyme activity was reduced, and he was diagnosed with TSD with a homozygous pathogenic variant of the HEXA gene (c. 571-1 G > T [IVS5, -1 G > T]), confirmed using direct sequence analysis. At 20 months, epileptic spasms in series around times of drowsiness and waking were observed on long-term video-electroencephalogram monitoring, in which ictal findings were different from those of startle seizures and non-epileptic myoclonus. Therefore, the epilepsy was classified as LOS. Epileptic spasms stopped following adrenocorticotropic hormone therapy, after which his vitality and consciousness improved. Serial MRS results showed a progressive decline in N-acetyl aspartate, and an increase in myoinositol in the grey matter over time. Our patient's MRS results suggested that cortical and subcortical axonal and neuronal degeneration with widespread gliosis in the cerebrum might lead to the development of LOS, and that LOS might be underestimated in patients with TSD."

    "title": "A master protocol to investigate a novel therapy acetyl-L-leucine for three ultra-rare neurodegenerative diseases: Niemann-Pick type C, the GM2 gangliosidoses, and ataxia telangiectasia.",
    "abstract": "The lack of approved treatments for the majority of rare diseases is reflective of the unique challenges of orphan drug development. Novel methodologies, including new functionally relevant endpoints, are needed to render the development process more feasible and appropriate for these rare populations and thereby expedite the approval of promising treatments to address patients' high unmet medical need. Here, we describe the development of an innovative master protocol and primary outcome assessment to investigate the modified amino acid N-acetyl-L-leucine (Sponsor Code: IB1001) in three separate, multinational, phase II trials for three ultra-rare, autosomal-recessive, neurodegenerative disorders: Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC), GM2 gangliosidoses (Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff disease; \"GM2\"), and ataxia telangiectasia (A-T). The innovative IB1001 master protocol and novel CI-CS primary endpoints were developed through a close collaboration between the Industry Sponsor, Key Opinion Leaders, representatives of the Patient Communities, and National Regulatory Authorities. As a result, the open-label, rater-blinded study design is considerate of the practical limitations of recruitment and retention of subjects in these ultra-orphan populations. The novel primary endpoint, the Clinical Impression of Change in Severity© (CI-CS), accommodates the heterogenous clinical presentation of NPC, GM2, and A-T: at screening, the principal investigator appoints for each patient a primary anchor test (either the 8-m walk test (8MWT) or 9-hole peg test of the dominant hand (9HPT-D)) based on his/her unique clinical symptoms. The anchor tests are videoed in a standardized manner at each visit to capture all aspects related to the patient's functional performance. The CI-CS assessment is ultimately performed by independent, blinded raters who compare videos of the primary anchor test from three periods: baseline, the end of treatment, and the end of a post-treatment washout. Blinded to the time point of each video, the raters make an objective comparison scored on a 7-point Likert scale of the change in the severity of the patient's neurological signs and symptoms from video A to video B. To investigate both the symptomatic and disease-modifying effects of treatment, N-acetyl-L-leucine is assessed during two treatment sequences: a 6-week parent study and 1-year extension phase. The novel CI-CS assessment, developed through a collaboration of all stakeholders, is advantageous in that it better ensures the primary endpoint is functionally relevant for each patient, is able to capture small but meaningful clinical changes critical to the patients' quality of life (fine-motor skills; gait), and blinds the primary outcome assessment. The results of these three trials will inform whether N-acetyl-L-leucine is an effective treatment for NPC, GM2, and A-T and can also serve as a new therapeutic paradigm for the development of future treatments for other orphan diseases. The three trials (IB1001-201 for Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC), IB1001-202 for GM2 gangliosidoses (Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff), IB1001-203 for ataxia telangiectasia (A-T)) have been registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03759639; NCT03759665; NCT03759678), www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu (EudraCT: 2018-004331-71; 2018-004406-25; 2018-004407-39), and https://www.germanctr.de (DR KS-ID: DRKS00016567; DRKS00017539; DRKS00020511)."

    "abstract": "Sandhoff disease (SD) is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder, resulting in accumulation of GM2 ganglioside, particular in neuronal cells. The disorder is caused by deficiency of β-hexosaminidase B (HEX-B), due to pathogenic variant of human HEXB gene. This study describes clinical features, biochemical, and genetic defects among Thai patients with infantile SD during 2008-2019. Five unrelated Thai patients presenting with developmental regression, axial hypotonia, seizures, exaggerated startle response to noise, and macular cherry red spot were confirmed to have infantile SD based on deficient HEX enzyme activities and biallelic variants of the HEXB gene. In addition, an uncommon presenting feature, cardiac defect, was observed in one patient. All the patients died in their early childhood. Plasma total HEX and HEX-B activities were severely deficient. Sequencing analysis of HEXB gene identified two variants including c.1652G>A (p.Cys551Tyr) and a novel variant of c.761T>C (p.Leu254Ser), in 90 and 10% of the mutant alleles found, respectively. The results from in silico analysis using multiple bioinformatics tools were in agreement that the p.Cys551Tyr and the p.Leu254Ser are likely pathogenic variants. Molecular modelling suggested that the Cys551Tyr disrupt disulfide bond, leading to protein destabilization while the Leu254Ser resulted in change of secondary structure from helix to coil and disturbing conformation of the active site of the enzyme. Genome-wide SNP array analysis showed no significant relatedness between the five affected individuals. These two variants were not present in control individuals. The prevalence of infantile SD in Thai population is estimated 1 in 1,458,521 and carrier frequency at 1 in 604. The study suggests that SD likely represents the most common subtype of rare infantile GM2 gangliosidosis identified among Thai patients. We firstly described a potential common variant in HEXB in Thai patients with infantile onset SD. The data can aid a rapid molecular confirmation of infantile SD starting with the hotspot variant and the use of expanded carrier testing."

    "abstract": "β-hexosaminidase is an enzyme responsible for the degradation of gangliosides, glycans, and other glycoconjugates containing β-linked hexosamines that enter the lysosome. GM2 gangliosidoses, such as Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff, are lysosomal storage disorders characterized by β-hexosaminidase deficiency and subsequent lysosomal accumulation of its substrate metabolites. These two diseases result in neurodegeneration and early mortality in children. A significant difference between these two disorders is the accumulation in Sandhoff disease of soluble oligosaccharide metabolites that derive from N- and O-linked glycans. In this paper we describe our results from a longitudinal biochemical study of a feline model of Sandhoff disease and an ovine model of Tay-Sachs disease to investigate the accumulation of GM2/GA2 gangliosides, a secondary biomarker for phospholipidosis, bis-(monoacylglycero)-phosphate, and soluble glycan metabolites in both tissue and fluid samples from both animal models. While both Sandhoff cats and Tay-Sachs sheep accumulated significant amounts of GM2 and GA2 gangliosides compared to age-matched unaffected controls, the Sandhoff cats having the more severe disease, accumulated larger amounts of gangliosides compared to Tay-Sachs sheep in their occipital lobes. For monitoring glycan metabolites, we developed a quantitative LC/MS assay for one of these free glycans in order to perform longitudinal analysis. The Sandhoff cats showed significant disease-related increases in this glycan in brain and in other matrices including urine which may provide a useful clinical tool for measuring disease severity and therapeutic efficacy. Finally, we observed age-dependent increasing accumulation for a number of analytes, especially in Sandhoff cats where glycosphingolipid, phospholipid, and glycan levels showed incremental increases at later time points without signs of peaking. This large animal natural history study for Sandhoff and Tay-Sachs is the first of its kind, providing insight into disease progression at the biochemical level. This report may help in the development and testing of new therapies to treat these disorders."

No treatments are currently approved for the gangliosidoses, and development of treatments is impaired by limited understanding of the natural history of these diseases. The objective of this study is to improve understanding of the juvenile gangliosidoses phenotypes and the late-infantile phenotypic subtype. Through a prospective natural history study of subjects with juvenile GM1- and GM2-gangliosidosis, a timeline of clinical changes was developed for the classic juvenile phenotypes and the late-infantile phenotypes and results of serial neurodevelopmental testing was analyzed. Several candidate 'outcome measures' were identified: changes in ambulation and verbalization skills, the communication domain from neurodevelopmental testing and the caregiver-reported socialization domain. The most common symptoms leading caregivers to seek a genetic diagnosis were changes in ambulation and verbalization."

    "abstract": "GM2 gangliosidosis, Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff diseases, are lysosomal storage disorders characterized by the lysosomal accumulation of GM2 gangliosides. This accumulation is due to deficiency in the activity of the β-hexosaminidases Hex-A or Hex-B, which are dimeric hydrolases formed by αβ or ββ subunits, respectively. These disorders show similar clinical manifestations that range from mild systemic symptoms to neurological damage and premature death. There is still no effective therapy for GM2 gangliosidoses, but some therapeutic alternatives, as enzyme replacement therapy, have being evaluated. Previously, we reported the production of active human recombinant β-hexosaminidases (rhHex-A and rhHex-B) in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris. In this study, we evaluated in vitro the cellular uptake, intracellular delivery to lysosome, and reduction of stored substrates. Both enzymes were taken-up via endocytic pathway mediated by mannose and mannose-6-phosphate receptors and delivered to lysosomes. Noteworthy, rhHex-A diminished the levels of stored lipids and lysosome mass in fibroblasts from Tay-Sachs patients. Overall, these results confirm the potential of P. pastoris as host to produce recombinant β-hexosaminidases intended to be used in the treatment of GM2 gangliosidosis."

    "abstract": "Screening for rare diseases first began more than 50 years ago with neonatal bloodspot screening (NBS) for phenylketonuria, and carrier screening for Tay-Sachs disease, sickle cell anaemia and β-thalassaemia. NBS's primary aim is health gain for children, while carrier screening enables autonomous reproductive choice. While screening can be beneficial, it also has the potential to cause harm and thus decisions are needed on whether a specific screening is worthwhile. These decisions are usually based on screening principles and criteria. Technological developments, both treatment driven and test driven, have led to expansions in neonatal screening and carrier screening. This article demonstrates how the dynamics and expansions in NBS and carrier screening have challenged four well-known screening criteria (treatment, test, target population and programme evaluation), and the decision-making based on them. We show that shifting perspectives on screening criteria for NBS as well as carrier screening lead to converging debates in these separate fields. For example, the child is traditionally considered to be the beneficiary in NBS, but the family and society can also benefit. Vice versa, carrier screening may be driven by disease prevention, rather than reproductive autonomy, raising cross-disciplinary questions regarding potential beneficiaries and which diseases to include. In addition, the stakeholders from these separate fields vary: Globally NBS is often governed as a public health programme while carrier screening is usually available via medical professionals. The article concludes with a call for an exchange of vision and knowledge among all stakeholders of both fields to attune the dynamics of screening."

There are not much data about gangliosidosis in India; hence, this study was planned. The aim is to study the clinical, biochemical, and molecular profile of gangliosidosis. A retrospective chart review, in the pediatric neurology department from January 2015 to March 2020, was performed. Children diagnosed with Gangliosidosis were included. The disorder was confirmed by reduced activity of enzymes and/or pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in associated genes. We assessed age at presentation, gender, parental consanguinity, clinical manifestations, neuroimaging findings, enzyme level, and pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Clinical data for 32 children with gangliosidosis were analyzed, which included 12 (37.5%) with GM1 gangliosidosis, 8 (25%) with Tay-Sachs disease (TSD), 11 (34.37%) with Sandhoff disease (SD), and 1 AB variant of GM2 gangliosidosis that occurs due to GM2 ganglioside activator protein deficiency. Twenty-four (75%) children were the offspring of consanguineous parents. Thirty-one (97%) had developmental delay. The median age at presentation was 15.5 months. Nine (28.12%) had seizures. Five children (41.6%) with GM1 gangliosidosis and two with SD had extensive Mongolian spots. Ten children with GM1 gangliosidosis (83.3%) had coarse facial features. Cherry red spot was found in 24 out of 32 children (75%). All children with GM1 gangliosidosis and none with TSD had hepato-splenomegaly. Two children (2/8; 25%) with TSD and seven (7/11; 63%) with SD had microcephaly. One child with SD had coarse facies and three did not have hepato-splenomegaly. Neuroimaging findings revealed bilateral thalamic involvement in 20 (62.5%) patients and periventricular hypomyelination in all cases. One child had a rare AB variant of GM2 gangliosidosis. GM2 Gangliosidoses are more common compared with GM1 variety. All of them had infantile onset except one child with TSD. Microcephaly can be present while usually megalencephaly is reported in the literature. The absence of hepato-splenomegaly does not rule out SD. Extensive Mongolian spots can be seen in GM2 gangliosidosis. AB variant of GM2 gangliosidosis should be considered when the enzyme is normal in the presence of strong clinical suspicion."

Mental disorders (anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia) affect about one fifth of the population and present an almost endless societal challenge at the frontier of human sciences. Prodigious technological advances in functional neuroimaging and large-scale genetics have not yet delivered the prospect of refined molecular understanding of mental illness beyond early anatomical descriptions of brain metabolism. However, intensive clinical phenotyping and quantitative metabolic studies using sophisticated radio-ligands in positron-emission tomography, persistently favor the neurobiological approach. This <i>Perspective</i> pursues a familiar maxim in Medicine, aptly summarized in the words of Arthur Koestler: \"Nature is generous in her senseless experiments on mankind.\" Hitherto, studies in neuropsychiatry have largely ignored rare genetic disorders but derangements of specific components within the cerebral laboratory offer rich opportunities for mechanistic exploration. Aberrant psychic behavior is characteristic of many inborn errors of metabolism and although each disorder represents a universe of its own, we are at a threshold for understanding, since contemporary genetics and cell biology furnish abundant materials to take on the perturbing enigma of mental derangement. A further development relates to orphan drugs with actions on defined molecular targets: these represent new ways to study the pathogenesis of psychiatric phenomena associated with rare diseases and in a manner not formerly possible. Here we introduce the frontier of schizophrenia and its strong association with late-onset Tay-Sachs disease as a paradigm to explore."

Of the hundreds of unique GSL structures, anionic gangliosides are the most heavily implicated in the pathogenesis of lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) such as Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff disease. Each LSD is characterized by the accumulation of GSLs in the lysosomes of neurons, which negatively interact with other intracellular molecules to culminate in cell death. In this review, we summarize the biosynthesis and degradation pathways of GSLs, discuss how aberrant GSL metabolism contributes to key features of LSD pathophysiology, draw parallels between LSDs and neurodegenerative proteinopathies such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease and lastly, discuss possible therapies for patients."

    "abstract": "Tay-Sachs disease (TSD), a type of GM2-gangliosidosis, is a progressive neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations in the α subunit of the lysosomal β-hexosaminidase enzyme. This disease is characterized by excessive accumulation of GM2 ganglioside, predominantly in the central nervous system. Although Tay-Sachs patients appear normal at birth, the progressive accumulation of undegraded GM2 gangliosides in neurons leads to death. Recently, an early onset Tay-Sachs disease mouse model, with genotype Hexa-/-Neu3-/-, was generated. Progressive accumulation of GM2 led to premature death of the double KO mice. Importantly, this double-deficient mouse model displays typical features of Tay-Sachs patients, such as cytoplasmic vacuolization of nerve cells, deterioration of Purkinje cells, neuronal death, deceleration in movement, ataxia, and tremors. GM2-gangliosidosis is characterized by acute neurodegeneration preceded by activated microglia expansion, macrophage, and astrocyte activation, along with the production of inflammatory mediators. However, the mechanism of disease progression in Hexa-/-Neu3-/- mice, relevant to neuroinflammation is poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the onset and progression of neuroinflammatory changes in the cortex, cerebellum, and retina of Hexa-/-Neu3-/- mice and control littermates by using a combination of molecular genetics and immunochemical procedures. We found elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine transcripts, such as Ccl2, Ccl3, Ccl4, and Cxcl10 and also extensive microglial and astrocyte activation and proliferation, accompanied by peripheral blood mononuclear cell infiltration in the vicinity of neurons and oligodendrocytes. Behavioral tests demonstrated a high level of anxiety, and age-dependent loss in both spatial learning and fear memory in Hexa-/-Neu3-/- mice compared with that in the controls. Altogether, our data suggest that Hexa-/-Neu3-/- mice display a phenotype similar to Tay-Sachs patients suffering from chronic neuroinflammation triggered by GM2 accumulation. Furthermore, our work contributes to better understanding of the neuropathology in a mouse model of early onset Tay-Sachs disease."

Central nervous system dysfunction is the main characteristic of GM2 gangliosidoses patients that include neurodevelopment alterations, neuroinflammation, and neuronal apoptosis.

This approach was explored as a means of capturing continuous data and moving away from focusing only on episodic data captured in traditional study designs. A strong emphasis was placed on real-time capture of symptoms and mobile Patient Reported Outcomes (mPROs) to identify the disease impact important to the patients themselves; an impact that may not always correlate with the measured clinical outcomes assessed during patient visits. This was supported by passive, continuous data capture from a wearable device. Adherence rate for wearing the device and completing the mPROs was 84 and 91%, respectively, resulting in a rich multidimensional dataset. As expected for a six-month proof-of-concept study in a disease that progresses slowly, statistically significant changes were not expected or observed in the clinical, mPROs, or wearable device data. The study demonstrated that patients were very enthusiastic and motivated to engage with the technology as demonstrated by excellent compliance. The combination of mPROs and wearables generates feature-rich datasets that could be a useful and feasible way to capture remote, real-time insight into disease burden."

    "abstract": "The GM2 gangliosidoses, Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) and Sandhoff disease (SD), are fatal lysosomal storage disorders caused by mutations in the HEXA and HEXB genes, respectively. These mutations cause dysfunction of the lysosomal enzyme β-N-acetylhexosaminidase A (HexA) and accumulation of GM2 ganglioside (GM2) with ensuing neurodegeneration, and death by 5 years of age. Until recently, the most successful therapy was achieved by intracranial co-delivery of monocistronic adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors encoding Hex alpha and beta-subunits in animal models of SD. The blood-brain barrier crossing properties of AAV9 enables systemic gene therapy; however, the requirement of co-delivery of two monocistronic AAV vectors to overexpress the heterodimeric HexA protein has prevented the use of this approach. To address this need, we developed multiple AAV constructs encoding simultaneously HEXA and HEXB using AAV9 and AAV-PHP.B and tested their therapeutic efficacy in 4- to 6-week-old SD mice after systemic administration. Survival and biochemical outcomes revealed superiority of the AAV vector design using a bidirectional CBA promoter with equivalent dose-dependent outcomes for both capsids. AAV-treated mice performed normally in tests of motor function, CNS GM2 ganglioside levels were significantly reduced, and survival increased by >4-fold with some animals surviving past 2 years of age."

Variants were separated into three groups according to the age of onset: infantile (<i>n</i>=28), juvenile (<i>n</i>=9) and adult (<i>n</i>=5).

Further, there are currently few fluorogenic substrates for hHEXA suitable for such requirements and there are no substrates ideal for cell-based inhibitor screening. Here, we clarified the difference in enzyme active site structure between hHEXA and hOGA from their tertiary structures. To develop lysosome-localized hHEXA-specific fluorogenic substrates based on the difference in their active site structures, our developed quinone methide cleavage substrate design platform was applied for the molecular design of substrates. Thereafter, we synthesized via the shortest route and evaluated novel three-color fluorogenic substrates for hHEXA that exhibited excellent specificity and sensitivity in three human cell lines.

Translation of thalamic injection to patients carries risks in that (1) it has never been done in humans, and (2) dosing scale-up based on brain weight from animals to humans requires injection of larger volumes. To increase the safety margin of this infusion, a flexible cannula was selected to enable simultaneous bilateral thalamic infusion in infants while monitoring by imaging and/or to enable awake infusions for injection of large volumes at low infusion rates. In this study, we tested various infusion volumes (200-800 μL) and rates (0.5-5 μL/min) to determine the maximum tolerated combination of injection parameters. Animals were followed for ∼1 month postinjection with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed at 14 and 28 days. T1-weighted MRI was used to quantify thalamic damage followed by histopathological assessment of the brain. Trends in data show that infusion volumes of 800 μL (2 × the volume required in sheep based on thalamic size) resulted in larger lesions than lower volumes, where the long infusion times (between 13 and 26 h) could have contributed to the generation of larger lesions. The target volume (400 μL, projected to be sufficient to cover most of the sheep thalamus) created the smallest lesion size. Cannula placement alone did result in damage, but this is likely associated with an inherent limitation of its use in a small brain due to the length of the distal rigid portion and lack of stable fixation. An injection rate of 5 μL/min at a volume ∼1/3 of the thalamus (400-600 μL) appears to be well tolerated in sheep both clinically and histopathologically."

    "abstract": "Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff disease are debilitating genetic diseases that affect the central nervous system leading to neurodegeneration through the accumulation of GM2 gangliosides. There are no cures for these diseases and treatments do not alleviate all symptoms. Hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy offers a promising treatment strategy for delivering wild-type enzymes to affected cells. By genetically modifying hematopoietic stem cells to express wild-type HexA and HexB, systemic delivery of functional enzyme can be achieved. Primary human hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells and Tay-Sachs affected cells were used to evaluate the functionality of the vector. An immunodeficient and humanized mouse model of Sandhoff disease was used to evaluate whether the HexA/HexB lentiviral vector transduced cells were able to improve the phenotypes associated with Sandhoff disease. An immunodeficient NOD-RAG1-/-IL2-/- (NRG) mouse model was used to evaluate whether the HexA/HexB vector transduced human CD34+ cells were able to engraft and undergo normal multilineage hematopoiesis. HexA/HexB lentiviral vector transduced cells demonstrated strong expression of HexA and HexB and restored enzyme activity in Tay-Sachs affected cells. Upon transplantation into a humanized Sandhoff disease mouse model, improved motor and behavioral skills were observed. Decreased GM2 gangliosides were observed in the brains of HexA/HexB vector transduced cell transplanted mice. Increased peripheral blood levels of HexB was also observed in transplanted mice. Normal hematopoiesis in the peripheral blood and various lymphoid organs was also observed in transplanted NRG mice. These results highlight the potential use of stem cell gene therapy as a treatment strategy for Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff disease."

Animal models are useful for probing the etiology and pathophysiology of disease and are critical for effective discovery and development of novel therapeutics for rare diseases. Here we review the impact of animal model organism research in three examples of congenital metabolic disorders to highlight distinct advantages of model system research. First, we discuss phenylketonuria research where a wide variety of research fields and models came together to make impressive progress and where a nearly ideal mouse model has been central to therapeutic advancements. Second, we review advancements in Lesch-Nyhan syndrome research to illustrate the role of models that do not perfectly recapitulate human disease as well as the need for multiple models of the same disease to fully investigate human disease aspects. Finally, we highlight research on the GM2 gangliosidoses Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff disease to illustrate the important role of both engineered traditional laboratory animal models and serendipitously identified atypical models in congenital metabolic disorder research. We close with perspectives for the future for animal model research in congenital metabolic disorders."

    "abstract": "Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) is a hereditary neurodegenerative condition inherited through an autosomal recessive pattern. The incidence and carrier frequency of infantile TSD were found to be increased among French Canadians in specific areas of the province of Quebec or calculated from New England populations with French-Canadian heritage. No accurate infantile TSD carrier frequency for the whole French-Canadian population in Quebec has been published. In this study, we estimate the incidence and carrier frequency of infantile TSD in the Quebec French-Canadian population. The number of TSD cases was ascertained during the 1992-2015 period, as well as the number of births to mothers whose language of use is French. Seven cases of TSD have been diagnosed in Quebec during the period of ascertainment. This corresponds to an incidence of 1/218,144, which in turn corresponds to a carrier frequency of 1/234. In the same 24-year period, there are two French-Canadian couples who had a fetus prenatally diagnosed with TSD. If these cases are included, the incidence of TSD in the French-Canadian population of Quebec is 1/169,668 and the carrier frequency 1/206. These findings can be used for genetic counseling and policy decisions regarding carrier screening for TSD in populations of French-Canadian descent."

    "title": "Influence of Dominance and Drift on Lethal Mutations in Human Populations.",
    "abstract": "We consider disease-causing mutations that are lethal when homozygous. Lethality involves the very strongest form of negative selection, with the selection coefficient against the disease-carrying homozygote having its maximum value of unity. We determine results for the behavior of the frequency of a lethal allele in an effectively infinite population. This includes an estimate of the time it takes to achieve equilibrium, and a description of transient behavior associated with a sudden change in the fitness of the heterozygote. We determine analogous results for a finite population, showing that a lethal disease-causing allele needs to be described by a modified Wright-Fisher model, which deviates from the standard model, where selection coefficients are assumed small compared with 1. We show that a by-product of the dynamics, resulting from the absence of the disease-allele carrying homozygote in adults, is the general constraint that the frequency of the disease-causing allele cannot exceed <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"> <mfrac><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow> <mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow> </mfrac> </math> . The results presented in this work should prove useful to a number of areas including analysis of lethal/near lethal mutations in Mendelian disorders and, in particular, for exploring how mutation-selection-drift balance explains the current spectrum of mutation frequencies in humans. While the number of empirical examples of overdominance in lethal genetic disorders is not large, relatively high observed heterozygote frequencies may be a hint of transient heterozygous advantage in nature. For lethal disorders with anomalous frequencies, such as cystic fibrosis and Tay-Sachs, our analysis lends further support to the role that transitory episodes of weak overdominance may play in the evolution of lethal mutations."

    "abstract": "The GM2 gangliosidoses (GM2), Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff diseases, are rare, autosomal recessive genetic disorders caused by mutations in the lysosomal enzyme β-hexosaminidase A (HEXA) or β-hexosaminidase B (HEXB) genes, respectively. A minority of patients have a late-onset form of disease that presents from late-childhood to adulthood and has a slowly progressive course with prolonged survival. Little research has been published documenting patient experiences with late-onset Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff diseases and how the disease impacts their daily lives and functioning. This study explored the most frequent symptoms and functional impacts experienced by patients with late-onset GM2 gangliosidosis through interviews with patients and caregivers. A qualitative research study design was employed, using three focus groups and 18 one-on-one interviews with patients who were recruited at the National Tay-Sachs and Allied Diseases Annual Family Conference. Transcripts were generated from the discussions, and patient quotes were analyzed using a content analysis approach. Concepts were aggregated into symptom and functional impacts, and the frequency of mention in the focus groups and individual interviews was calculated. Many of the frequently described symptoms [muscle weakness (n = 19, 95%), \"clumsy\" gait (n = 12, 60%), fatigue (n = 10, 50%)] and impacts [difficulty walking (n = 19, 95%), falling (n = 17, 85%), and climbing stairs (n = 16, 80%)] disclosed by patients and caregivers were similar to those previously reported in the literature. However, less frequently described symptoms such as gastrointestinal issues (n = 4, 20%) and coughing fits (n = 5, 25%) have been expanded upon. This study evaluated the immediate impact of these symptoms on the patients' lives to highlight the burden of these symptoms and the functional limitations on daily living activities, independence, and emotional well-being. The findings were used to develop a conceptual disease model that could serve as a foundation for patient-centered outcomes in clinical trials and provide insights to the medical community that may benefit patient care. This study contributes to the current understanding of symptoms associated with late-onset GM2 gangliosidosis, and further identifies the many consequences and impacts of the disease. These symptoms and impacts could be measured in clinical trials to examine the effects of novel treatments from the patient perspective."

    "abstract": "Lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) are a group of about 50 inborn errors of metabolism characterized by the lysosomal accumulation of partially or non-degraded molecules due to mutations in proteins involved in the degradation of macromolecules, transport, lysosomal biogenesis or modulators of lysosomal environment. Significant advances have been achieved in the diagnosis, management, and treatment of LSDs patients. In terms of approved therapies, these include enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), substrate reduction therapy, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and pharmacological chaperone therapy. In this review, we summarize the Colombian experience in LSDs thorough the evidence published. We identified 113 articles published between 1995 and 2019 that included Colombian researchers or physicians, and which were mainly focused in Mucopolysaccharidoses, Pompe disease, Gaucher disease, Fabry disease, and Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff diseases. Most of these articles focused on basic research, clinical cases, and mutation reports. Noteworthy, implementation of the enzyme assay in dried blood samples, led to a 5-fold increase in the identification of LSD patients, suggesting that these disorders still remain undiagnosed in the country. We consider that the information presented in this review will contribute to the knowledge of a broad spectrum of LSDs in Colombia and will also contribute to the development of public policies and the identification of research opportunities."

    "abstract": "The Israeli population, encompassing 9 million citizens, is comprised of diverse communities. The Ministry of Health genetic screening program for reproductive purposes was introduced in 2013. This program is mainly aimed at severe incurable diseases with high rates of infant and childhood morbidity and/or mortality, with a carrier frequency of at least 1:60 and/or a disease frequency of 1 in 15 000 live births. In this paper, we present the results of the national genetic carrier-screening program implementation. Data acquisition for this study was performed by retrospectively searching Ministry of Health database, which includes the reports of 18 genetic laboratories performing genetic screening tests. During 2015-2017, a total of 919 820 carrier-screening genetic tests were executed. The overall number rose by 14.9% over these years. For about two-thirds of the presented disorders, carrier frequency was within the expected range. A decrease of 57% was noted in the observed number of patients with spinal muscular atrophy born during 2014-2017, compared with the expected rate. Familial dysautonomia, Canavan and Tay-Sachs diseases yielded a very low prevalence. Our results highlight the impact of a national genetic carrier-screening program. Couples at risk of an affected fetus mostly choose to perform preconception or prenatal diagnosis and to act accordingly. Our country has several characteristics enabling us to achieve this success, including considerable rates of endogamy and consanguineous marriages, increased frequency of founder mutations, and high fertility rates. In addition, wide accessibility of the tests and good compliance of the population must be noted. Still, raising the awareness and continuing education of population and caregivers about the importance and efficiency of carrier screening remains an important issue. Finally, expanding the existing tests into a uniform, wide genetic panel seems to be the next goal."

    "abstract": "Gangliosides have a wide variety of biological functions due to their location on the outer leaflet of plasma membranes. They form a critical component of membrane rafts, or ganglioside-enriched microdomains, where they influence the physical properties of the membrane as well as its function. Gangliosides can change their structure to meet their external and internal environmental demands. This ability to change structure makes gangliosides both fascinating and technologically challenging targets to identify and understand. A full understanding on how gangliosides are regulated within the central nervous system (CNS) is critical, as ganglioside dysregulation is observed in the aging brain as well as in several neurodegenerative injuries and diseases such as stroke, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease and several lysosomal storage disorders diseases, including Tay Sach's disease. Mass spectrometry (MS) has become a useful means to better understand ganglioside composition and function. Imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) provides the added benefit of placing analytical information within an anatomical context. This review article will discuss recent advances in MS-based detection methods, with a focus on IMS-based approaches to help understand the spatial-specific role gangliosides in the healthy brain as in CNS injuries and disease."

Most patients have childhood onset, but some experience the first symptoms during adolescence/adulthood. This study aims to clarify the natural history of adult patients with GM2 gangliosidosis. We retrospectively described 12 patients from a French cohort and 45 patients from the literature. We observed 4 typical presentations: (1) lower motoneuron disorder responsible for proximal lower limb weakness that subsequently expanded to the upper limbs, (2) cerebellar ataxia, (3) psychosis and/or severe mood disorder (only in the TS patients), and (4) a complex phenotype mixing the above 3 manifestations. The psoas was the first and most affected muscle in the lower limbs, whereas the triceps and interosseous were predominantly involved in the upper limbs. A longitudinal study of compound motor action potentials showed a progressive decrease in all nerves, with different kinetics. Sensory potentials were sometimes abnormally low, mainly in the SD patients. The main brain magnetic resonance imaging feature was cerebellar atrophy, even in patients without cerebellar symptoms. The prognosis was mainly related to gait disorder, as we showed that beyond 20 years of disease evolution, half of the patients were wheelchair users. Improved knowledge of GM2 gangliosidosis in adults will help clinicians achieve correct diagnoses and better inform patients on the evolution and prognosis. It may also contribute to defining proper outcome measures when testing emerging therapies. ANN NEUROL 2020;87:609-617."

    "title": "A novel gene editing system to treat both Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff diseases.",
    "abstract": "The GM2-gangliosidoses are neurological diseases causing premature death, thus developing effective treatment protocols is urgent. GM2-gangliosidoses result from deficiency of a lysosomal enzyme β-hexosaminidase (Hex) and subsequent accumulation of GM2 gangliosides. Genetic changes in HEXA, encoding the Hex α subunit, or HEXB, encoding the Hex β subunit, causes Tay-Sachs disease and Sandhoff disease, respectively. Previous studies have showed that a modified human Hex µ subunit (HEXM) can treat both Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff diseases by forming a homodimer to degrade GM2 gangliosides. To this end, we applied this HEXM subunit in our PS813 gene editing system to treat neonatal Sandhoff mice. Through AAV delivery of the CRISPR system, a promoterless HEXM cDNA will be integrated into the albumin safe harbor locus, and lysosomal enzyme will be expressed and secreted from edited hepatocytes. 4 months after the i.v. of AAV vectors, plasma MUGS and MUG activities reached up to 144- and 17-fold of wild-type levels (n = 10, p < 0.0001), respectively. More importantly, MUGS and MUG activities in the brain also increased significantly compared with untreated Sandhoff mice (p < 0.001). Further, HPLC-MS/MS analysis showed that GM2 gangliosides in multiple tissues, except the brain, of treated mice were reduced to normal levels. Rotarod analysis showed that coordination and motor memory of treated mice were improved (p < 0.05). Histological analysis of H&E stained tissues showed reduced cellular vacuolation in the brain and liver of treated Sandhoff mice. These results demonstrate the potential of developing a treatment of in vivo genome editing for Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff patients."

    "abstract": "Most lysosomal storage disorders affect the central nervous system. However, lysosomal enzymes do not cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and intravenous enzyme infusion is not effective for the brain. Lysosomal enzymes can be re-engineered for BBB transport as IgG-enzyme fusion proteins, where the IgG domain is a monoclonal antibody (MAb) against an endogenous BBB receptor/transporter, and which acts as a molecular Trojan horse to deliver the enzyme to brain. However, the problem is retention of high enzyme activity following enzyme fusion to the IgG. The present investigation shows this is possible with a versatile approach that employs fusion of the enzyme to either the IgG heavy chain or light chain using a long flexible linker. The model IgG is a chimeric monoclonal antibody (MAb) against the human insulin receptor (HIR). The enzyme activity of the HIRMAb-enzyme fusion protein is preserved for hexosaminidase A, which is mutated in Tay Sachs disease, for protein palmitoylthioesterase-1, which is mutated in Batten disease type 1, acid sphingomyelinase, which is mutated in Niemann Pick disease type A, and beta galactosidase-1, which is mutated in GM1 gangliosidosis."

    "abstract": "Global gene delivery to the CNS has therapeutic importance for the treatment of neurological disorders that affect the entire CNS. Due to direct contact with the CNS, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is an attractive route for CNS gene delivery. A safe and effective route to achieve global gene distribution in the CNS is needed, and administration of genes through the cisterna magna (CM) via a suboccipital puncture results in broad distribution in the brain and spinal cord. However, translation of this technique to clinical practice is challenging due to the risk of serious and potentially fatal complications in patients. Herein, we report development of a gene therapy delivery method to the CM through adaptation of an intravascular microcatheter, which can be safely navigated intrathecally under fluoroscopic guidance. We examined the safety, reproducibility, and distribution/transduction of this method in sheep using a self-complementary adeno-associated virus 9 (scAAV9)-GFP vector. This technique was used to treat two Tay-Sachs disease patients (30 months old and 7 months old) with AAV gene therapy. No adverse effects were observed during infusion or post-treatment. This delivery technique is a safe and minimally invasive alternative to direct infusion into the CM, achieving broad distribution of AAV gene transfer to the CNS."

Cystic fibrosis carrier screening became possible in the late 1980s and with technical advances, screening of an ever increasing number of genes has become possible. The goal of carrier screening is to inform people about their risk of having children with autosomal recessive and X-linked recessive disorders, to allow for informed decision making about reproductive options. The consequence may be a decrease in the birth prevalence of these conditions, which has occurred in several countries for some conditions. Different programs target different groups (high school, premarital, couples before conception, couples attending fertility clinics, and pregnant women) as does the governance structure (public health initiative and user pays). Ancestry-based offers of screening are being replaced by expanded carrier screening panels with multiple genes that is independent of ancestry. This review describes screening in Australia, Cyprus, Israel, Italy, Malaysia, the Netherlands, Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. It provides an insight into the enormous variability in how reproductive carrier screening is offered across the globe.

Sphingolipidoses (SP), which usually involve the loss of sphingolipid hydrolase function, are of lysosomal origin, and represent an important group of rare diseases among lysosomal storage disorders. Initial treatments consisted of enzyme replacement therapy, but, in recent decades, various therapeutic approaches have been developed. However, these commonly used treatments for SP fail to be fully effective and do not penetrate the blood-brain barrier. New approaches, such as genome editing, have great potential for both the treatment and study of sphingolipidoses. Here, we review the most recent advances in the treatment and modelling of SP through the application of CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing. CRISPR-Cas9 is currently the most widely used method for genome editing. This technique is versatile; it can be used for altering the regulation of genes involved in sphingolipid degradation and synthesis pathways, interrogating gene function, generating knock out models, or knocking in mutations. CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing is being used as an approach to disease treatment, but more frequently it is utilized to create models of disease. New CRISPR-Cas9-based tools of gene editing with diminished off-targeting effects are evolving and seem to be more promising for the correction of individual mutations. Emerging Prime results and CRISPR-Cas9 difficulties are also discussed."

    "abstract": "The favorable outcome of in vivo and ex vivo gene therapy approaches in several Lysosomal Storage Diseases suggests that these treatment strategies might equally benefit GM2 gangliosidosis. Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff disease (the main forms of GM2 gangliosidosis) result from mutations in either the HEXA or HEXB genes encoding, respectively, the α- or β-subunits of the lysosomal β-Hexosaminidase enzyme. In physiological conditions, α- and β-subunits combine to generate β-Hexosaminidase A (HexA, αβ) and β-Hexosaminidase B (HexB, ββ). A major impairment to establishing in vivo or ex vivo gene therapy for GM2 gangliosidosis is the need to synthesize the α- and β-subunits at high levels and with the correct stoichiometric ratio, and to safely deliver the therapeutic products to all affected tissues/organs. Here, we report the generation and in vitro validation of novel bicistronic lentiviral vectors (LVs) encoding for both the murine and human codon optimized Hexa and Hexb genes. We show that these LVs drive the safe and coordinate expression of the α- and β-subunits, leading to supranormal levels of β-Hexosaminidase activity with prevalent formation of a functional HexA in SD murine neurons and glia, murine bone marrow-derived hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs), and human SD fibroblasts. The restoration/overexpression of β-Hexosaminidase leads to the reduction of intracellular GM2 ganglioside storage in transduced and in cross-corrected SD murine neural progeny, indicating that the transgenic enzyme is secreted and functional. Importantly, bicistronic LVs safely and efficiently transduce human neurons/glia and CD34+ HSPCs, which are target and effector cells, respectively, in prospective in vivo and ex vivo GT approaches. We anticipate that these bicistronic LVs may overcome the current requirement of two vectors co-delivering the α- or β-subunits genes. Careful assessment of the safety and therapeutic potential of these bicistronic LVs in the SD murine model will pave the way to the clinical development of LV-based gene therapy for GM2 gangliosidosis."

We performed more than 175 edits in human cells, including targeted insertions, deletions, and all 12 types of point mutation, without requiring double-strand breaks or donor DNA templates. We used prime editing in human cells to correct, efficiently and with few byproducts, the primary genetic causes of sickle cell disease (requiring a transversion in HBB) and Tay-Sachs disease (requiring a deletion in HEXA); to install a protective transversion in PRNP; and to insert various tags and epitopes precisely into target loci. Four human cell lines and primary post-mitotic mouse cortical neurons support prime editing with varying efficiencies. Prime editing shows higher or similar efficiency and fewer byproducts than homology-directed repair, has complementary strengths and weaknesses compared to base editing, and induces much lower off-target editing than Cas9 nuclease at known Cas9 off-target sites. Prime editing substantially expands the scope and capabilities of genome editing, and in principle could correct up to 89% of known genetic variants associated with human diseases."

Phenotypes of gangliosidoses range from infantile, late-infantile, juvenile, and to the adult form. The genotype-phenotype correlation is essential for prognosis and clinical care planning for patients with a gangliosidosis condition. Previously, we have developed a method to establish the genotype-phenotype correlation of another lysosomal disease, mucopolysaccharidosis type I, with in silico tools. This same method was applied to analyze the genotype and phenotype of 38 patients diagnosed with a gangliosidosis disease in the United States. Out of 40 mutations identified, 3 were novel, including p.Tyr192His and p.Phe556Ser of the <i>GLB1</i> gene and p.Gly461Val of the <i>HEXA</i> gene. Furthermore, the mutant protein structure of all missense mutations was constructed by homology modeling. A systemic structural analysis of these models revealed the specific mechanisms of how each mutation may lead to the disease. In summary, the method developed in this study holds promise as a tool that can be broadly applicable to other lysosomal diseases and monogenic diseases."

    "abstract": "In Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff disease, a deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme β-hexosaminidase causes GM2 and other gangliosides to accumulate in neurons and triggers neurodegeneration. Although the pathology centers on neurons, β-hexosaminidase is mainly expressed outside of neurons, suggesting that gene therapy of these diseases should target non-neuronal cells to reconstitute physiological conditions. Here, we tested in <i>Hexb</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice, a model of Sandhoff disease, to determine whether endothelial expression of the genes for human β-hexosaminidase subunit A and B (<i>HEXA</i>, <i>HEXB</i>) is able to reduce disease symptoms and prolong survival of the affected mice. The brain endothelial selective vectors AAV-BR1-CAG-<i>HEXA</i> and AAV-BR1-CAG-<i>HEXB</i> transduced brain endothelial cells, which subsequently released β-hexosaminidase enzyme. <i>In vivo</i> intravenous administration of the gene vectors to adult and neonatal mice prolonged survival. They improved neurological function and reduced accumulation of the ganglioside GM2 and the glycolipid GA2 as well as astrocytic activation. Overall, the data demonstrate that endothelial cells are a suitable target for intravenous gene therapy of GM2 gangliosidoses and possibly other lysosomal storage disorders."

    "abstract": "Pathogenic variants in HEXA that impair β-hexosaminidase A (Hex A) enzyme activity cause Tay-Sachs Disease (TSD), a severe autosomal-recessive neurodegenerative disorder. Hex A enzyme analysis demonstrates near-zero activity in patients affected with TSD and can also identify carriers, whose single functional copy of HEXA results in reduced enzyme activity relative to noncarriers. Although enzyme testing has been optimized and widely used for carrier screening in Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) individuals, it has unproven sensitivity and specificity in a pan-ethnic population. The ability to detect HEXA variants via DNA analysis has evolved from limited targeting of a few ethnicity-specific variants to next-generation sequencing (NGS) of the entire coding region coupled with interpretation of any discovered novel variants. We combined results of enzyme testing, retrospective computational analysis, and variant reclassification to estimate the respective clinical performance of TSD screening via enzyme analysis and NGS. We maximized NGS accuracy by reclassifying variants of uncertain significance and compared to the maximum performance of enzyme analysis estimated by calculating ethnicity-specific frequencies of variants known to yield false-positive or false-negative enzyme results (e.g., pseudodeficiency and B1 alleles). In both AJ and non-AJ populations, the estimated clinical sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value were higher by NGS than by enzyme testing. The differences were significant for all comparisons except for AJ clinical sensitivity, where NGS exceeded enzyme testing, but not significantly. Our results suggest that performance of an NGS-based TSD carrier screen that interrogates the entire coding region and employs novel variant interpretation exceeds that of Hex A enzyme testing, warranting a reconsideration of existing guidelines."

Here, we generated iPSCs derived from patients with TSD, and found similar potential for neural differentiation between TSD-iPSCs and normal iPSCs, although neural progenitor cells (NPCs) derived from the TSD-iPSCs exhibited enlarged lysosomes and upregulation of the lysosomal marker, LAMP1, caused by the accumulation of GM2 ganglioside. The NPCs derived from TSD-iPSCs also had an increased incidence of oxidative stress-induced cell death. TSD-iPSC-derived neurons showed a decrease in exocytotic activity with the accumulation of GM2 ganglioside, suggesting deficient neurotransmission in TSD. Our findings demonstrated that NPCs and mature neurons derived from TSD-iPSCs are potentially useful cellular models of TSD and are useful for investigating the efficacy of drug candidates in the future."

In spite of the genetic origin of GM2 gangliosidosis, the cascade of events leading from the gene/protein defects to the cell dysfunction and death is not fully elucidated. At present, there is no cure for patients. Taking advantage of the animal models of two forms of GM2 gangliosidosis, Tay-Sachs (TSD) and Sandhoff (SD) diseases, we performed a microRNA screening in the brain subventricular zone (SVZ) and striatum (STR), which feature the neurogenesis and neurodegeneration states, respectively, in adult mutant mice. We found abnormal expression of a panel of miRNAs involved in lipid metabolism, CNS development and homeostasis, and neuropathological processes, highlighting region- and disease-specific profiles of miRNA expression. Moreover, by using a computational analysis approach, we identified a unique disease- (SD or TSD) and brain region-specific (SVZ vs. STR) miRNAs signatures of predicted networks potentially related to the pathogenesis of the diseases. These results may contribute to the understanding of GM2 gangliosidosis pathophysiology, with the aim of developing effective treatments."

Two of these sphingolipidoses, Tay Sachs and Sandhoff diseases, are caused by β-Hexosaminidase (HEXB) enzyme deficiency, resulting in ganglioside (GM2) accumulation and neuronal loss. The precise sequence of cellular events preceding, and leading to, neuropathology remains unclear, but likely involves inflammation and lysosomal accumulation of GM2 in multiple cell types. We aimed to determine the consequences of Hexb activity loss for different brain cell types using zebrafish. Hexb deficient zebrafish (hexb<sup>-/-</sup> ) showed lysosomal abnormalities already early in development both in radial glia, which are the neuronal and glial progenitors, and in microglia. Additionally, at 5 days postfertilization, hexb<sup>-/-</sup> zebrafish showed reduced locomotor activity. Although specific oligosaccharides accumulate in the adult brain, hexb<sup>-/-</sup> ) zebrafish are viable and apparently resistant to Hexb deficiency. In all, we identified cellular consequences of loss of Hexb enzyme activity during embryonic brain development, showing early effects on glia, which possibly underlie the behavioral aberrations. Hereby, we identified clues into the contribution of non-neuronal lysosomal abnormalities in LSDs affecting the brain and provide a tool to further study what underlies the relative resistance to Hexb deficiency in vivo."

A genetically based disturbance of GM2 catabolism, leads to several subtypes of the GM2 gangliosidosis: Tay-Sachs disease, Sandhoff disease, the AB-variant and the B1-variant, all of them having GM2 as major lysosomal storage compound. Further on it is known that the gangliosides GM2 and GM3 accumulate as secondary storage compounds in mucopolysaccharidoses, especially in Hunter disease, Hurler disease, Sanfilippo disease and Sly syndrome, with chondroitin sulfate as primary storage compound. The exact mechanism of ganglioside accumulation in mucopolysaccaridoses is still a matter of debate. Here, we show that chondroitin sulfate strongly inhibits the catabolism of membrane-bound GM2 by β-hexosaminidase A in presence of GM2 activator protein in vitro already at low micromolar concentrations. In contrast, hyaluronan, the major storage compound in mucopolysaccharidosis IX, a milder disease without secondary ganglioside accumulation, is a less effective inhibitor. On the other hand, hydrolysis of micellar-bound GM2 by β-hexosaminidase A without the assistance of GM2AP was not impeded by chondroitin sulfate implicating that the inhibition of GM2 hydrolysis by chondroitin sulfate is most likely based on an interaction with GM2AP, the GM2AP-GM2 complex or the GM2-carrying membranes. We also studied the influence of some cationic amphiphilic drugs (desipramine, chlorpromazine, imipramine and chloroquine), provoking drug induced phospholipidosis and found that all of them inhibited the hydrolysis of GM2 massively."

The late-onset form of disease (LOTS) is considered rare, and only a limited number of cases have been reported. The clinical course of LOTS differs substantially from classic infantile TSD. Comprehensive data from 14 Czech patients with LOTS were collated, including results of enzyme assays and genetic analyses. 14 patients (9 females, 5 males) with LOTS were diagnosed between 2002 and 2018 in the Czech Republic (a calculated birth prevalence of 1 per 325,175 live births). The median age of first symptoms was 21 years (range 10-33 years), and the median diagnostic delay was 10.5 years (range 0-29 years). The main clinical symptoms at the time of manifestation were stammering or slurred speech, proximal weakness of the lower extremities due to anterior horn cell neuronopathy, signs of neo- and paleocerebellar dysfunction and/or psychiatric disorders. Cerebellar atrophy detected through brain MRI was a common finding. Residual enzyme activity was 1.8-4.1% of controls. All patients carried the typical LOTS-associated c.805G>A (p.Gly269Ser) mutation on at least one allele, while a novel point mutation, c.754C>T (p.Arg252Cys) was found in two siblings. LOTS seems to be an underdiagnosed cause of progressive distal motor neuron disease, with variably expressed cerebellar impairment and psychiatric symptomatology in our group of adolescent and adult patients.

Mutations in any of these genes result in a different type of GM2 gangliosidosis (Tay-Sachs disease, Sandhoff disease, and the B1 and AB variants of GM2 gangliosidosis), with GM2 as the major lysosomal storage compound. GM2 is also a secondary storage compound in lysosomal storage diseases such as Niemann-Pick disease types A-C, with primary storage of SM in type A and cholesterol in types B and C, respectively. The reconstitution of GM2 catabolism at liposomal surfaces carrying GM2 revealed that incorporating lipids into the GM2-carrying membrane such as cholesterol, SM, sphingosine, and sphinganine inhibits GM2 hydrolysis by β-hexosaminidase A assisted by GM2 activator protein, while anionic lipids, ceramide, fatty acids, lysophosphatidylcholine, and diacylglycerol stimulate GM2 catabolism. In contrast, the hydrolysis of the synthetic, water-soluble substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl-6-sulfo-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-β-d-glucopyranoside was neither significantly affected by membrane lipids such as ceramide or SM nor stimulated by anionic lipids such as bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate added as liposomes, detergent micelles, or lipid aggregates. Moreover, hydrolysis-inhibiting lipids also had an inhibiting effect on the solubilization and mobilization of membrane-bound lipids by the GM2 activator protein, while the stimulating lipids enhanced lipid mobilization."

In 2014, JScreen began reporting to patients variants of uncertain significance (VUSs) in the gene that causes Tay-Sachs disease (HEXA). Genetic counseling was provided to discuss the VUS and patients were offered hexosaminidase A (HEXA) blood enzyme testing to assist with VUS reclassification. To identify patient reactions and factors influencing their follow-up testing decisions after receiving these results, we conducted a retrospective quantitative study by administering online surveys to 62 patients with HEXA VUSs. Participants who pursued enzyme testing and those who did not both experienced low levels of distress when receiving the VUS results. Perceptions of HEXA carrier status after genetic counseling, decisional conflict levels, plans to have children in the near future, time available to pursue enzyme testing, and eligibility for research were significant factors influencing decision-making to pursue or not pursue enzyme testing. Genetic counseling played an important role in helping patients understand the VUS and follow-up testing options. When discussing VUSs with patients, it would be beneficial for genetic counselors to focus on the patient's perception of the VUS, anxiety related to the uncertainty of their results, and follow-up options, when available."

Tay-Sachs patients with the infantile form do not live beyond 2-4 years of age due to rapid, progressive neurodegeneration. Enzyme replacement therapy is not a therapeutic option due to its inability to cross the blood-brain barrier. As an alternative, small molecules identified from high-throughput screening could provide leads suitable for chemical optimization to target the central nervous system. We developed a new high-throughput phenotypic assay utilizing infantile Tay-Sachs patient cells based on disrupted lysosomal calcium signaling as a monitor of diseased phenotype. The assay was validated in a pilot screen on a collection of Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs to identify compounds that could reverse or attenuate the disease. Pyrimethamine, a known pharmacological chaperone of β-hexosaminidase A, was identified from the primary screen. The mechanism of action of pyrimethamine in reversing the defective lysosomal phenotype was by improving autophagy. This new high-throughput screening assay in patient cells will enable the screening of larger chemical compound collections. Importantly, this approach could lead to identification of new molecular targets previously unknown to impact the disease and accelerate the discovery of new treatments for Tay-Sachs disease."

For individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, carrier screening, per the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics, also includes testing for Tay-Sachs disease and four other IEM. Inborn errors of metabolism can present in utero; in newborns; or in children, adolescents, and adults. Some IEM can be detected in utero with the use of ultrasonography. Most commonly, IEM are detected at newborn screening. Expanded newborn screening, which now includes 34 core conditions, allows for diagnosis in the newborn period and provides the opportunity for early institution of available treatments. However, some newborns present with symptoms consistent with an IEM before the availability of pending newborn screening results or present with symptoms attributable to an IEM not detectable with screening. Such situations are medical emergencies requiring immediate consultation with a metabolic specialist. If a delay occurs in obtaining consultation, initial treatment involves discontinuing feeding and providing high-rate glucose infusions. Some IEM present later in life. Children may develop and present with dysmorphic facial features. In some cases, symptoms may not appear until adolescence or adulthood when patients have residual enzyme activity that allows for slow accumulation of toxic molecules over time. Long-term treatments are effective for some IEM. Treatments include dietary restrictions and enzyme-replacement therapies."

This disease is caused by β-hexosaminidase A (HexA) enzyme deficiency due to various mutations in α-subunit gene of this enzyme, resulting in GM2 ganglioside accumulation predominantly in lysosomes of nerve cells. Tay-Sachs disease is characterized by acute neurodegeneration preceded by activated microglia expansion, macrophage and astrocyte activation along with inflammatory mediator production. In most cases, the disease manifests itself during infancy, the \"infantile form,\" which characterizes the most severe disorders of the nervous system. The juvenile form, the symptoms of which appear in adolescence, and the most rare form with late onset of symptoms in adulthood are also described. The typical features of Tay-Sachs disease are muscle weakness, ataxia, speech, and mental disorders. Clinical symptom severity depends on residual HexA enzymatic activity associated with some mutations. Currently, Tay-Sachs disease treatment is based on symptom relief and, in case of the late-onset form, on the delay of progression. There are also clinical reports of substrate reduction therapy using miglustat and bone marrow or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. At the development stage there are methods of Tay-Sachs disease gene therapy using adeno- or adeno-associated viruses as vectors for the delivery of cDNA encoding α and β HexA subunit genes. Effectiveness of this approach is evaluated in α or β HexA subunit defective model mice or Jacob sheep, in which Tay-Sachs disease arises spontaneously and is characterized by the same pathological features as in humans.

A small proportion of TSD patients carry milder mutations and may present juvenile or adult onset milder disease. TSD is more prevalent among Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) individuals and some other genetically isolated populations with carrier frequencies of approximately ~1:27 which is much higher than that of 1:300 in the general population. Carrier screening and prenatal testing for TSD are effective in preventing the birth of affected fetuses greatly diminishing the incidence of TSD. Testing of targeted HEXA mutations by genotyping or sequencing can detect 98% of carriers in AJ individuals; however, the detection rate is much lower for most other ethnic groups.

    "abstract": "GM2-gangliosidosis, a subgroup of lysosomal storage disorders, is caused by deficiency of hexosaminidase activity, and comprises the closely related Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff diseases. The enzyme deficiency prevents normal metabolization of ganglioside GM2, usually resulting in progressive neurodegenerative disease. The molecular mechanisms whereby GM2 accumulation in neurons triggers neurodegeneration remain unclear. In vitro experiments, using microsomes from Sandhoff mouse model brain, showed that increase of GM2 content negatively modulates sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase (SERCA) (Pelled et al., 2003). Furthermore, Ca<sup>2+</sup> depletion in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) triggers Unfolded Protein Response (UPR), which tends to restore homeostasis in the ER; however, if cellular damage persists, an apoptotic response is initiated. We found that ER GM2 accumulation in cultured neurons induces luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup> depletion, which in turn activates PERK (protein kinase RNA [PKR]-like ER kinase), one of three UPR sensors. PERK signaling displayed biphasic activation; i.e., early upregulation of cytoprotective calcineurin (CN) and, under prolonged ER stress, enhanced expression of pro-apoptotic transcription factor C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP). Moreover, GM2 accumulation in neuronal cells induced neurite atrophy and apoptosis. Both processes were effectively modulated by treatment with the selective PERK inhibitor GSK2606414, by CN knockdown, and by CHOP knockdown. Overall, our findings demonstrate the essential role of PERK signaling pathway contributing to neurodegeneration in a model of GM2-gangliosidosis."

Recent reports that progranulin (PGRN) functions as a chaperone of lysosomal enzymes and its deficiency is associated with LSDs, including Gaucher disease and neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, prompted us to screen the effects of recombinant PGRN on lysosomal storage in fibroblasts from 11 patients affected by various LSDs, which led to the isolation of TSD in which PGRN demonstrated the best effects in reducing lysosomal storage. Subsequent in vivo studies revealed significant GM2 accumulation and the existence of typical TSD cells containing zebra bodies in both aged and ovalbumin-challenged adult PGRN-deficient mice. In addition, HexA, but not HexB, was aggregated in PGRN-deficient cells. Furthermore, recombinant PGRN significantly reduced GM2 accumulation and lysosomal storage in these animal models. Mechanistic studies indicated that PGRN bound to HexA through granulins G and E domain and increased the enzymatic activity and lysosomal delivery of HexA. More importantly, Pcgin, an engineered PGRN derivative bearing the granulin E domain, also effectively bound to HexA and reduced the GM2 accumulation. Collectively, these studies not only provide new insights into the pathogenesis of TSD but may also have implications for developing PGRN-based therapy for this life-threatening disorder. KEY MESSAGES: GM2 accumulation and the existence of typical TSD cells containing zebra bodies are detected in both aged and ovalbumin-challenged adult PGRN deficient mice. Recombinant PGRN significantly reduces GM2 accumulation and lysosomal storage both in vivo and in vitro, which works through increasing the expression and lysosomal delivery of HexA. Pcgin, an engineered PGRN derivative bearing the granulin E domain, also effectively binds to to HexA and reduces GM2 accumulation."

We generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from two TSD patient dermal fibroblast lines and further differentiated them into neural stem cells (NSCs). The TSD neural stem cells exhibited a disease phenotype of lysosomal lipid accumulation.

Using this disease model, we observed reduction of lipid accumulation by employing enzyme replacement therapy as well as by the use of HPβCD and δ-tocopherol. Our results demonstrate that the Tay-Sachs disease NSCs possess the characteristic phenotype to serve as a cell-based disease model for study of the disease pathogenesis and evaluation of drug efficacy.

This is the first report of deletion/duplication in HEXA gene providing a new insight into the molecular basis of TSD and use of MLPA assay for detecting large copy number changes in the HEXA gene."

    "title": "Presentation of central precocious puberty in two patients with Tay-Sachs disease.",
    "abstract": "Tay-Sachs disease is an autosomal recessive type of lysosomal storage disorder. The disease is very rare in Turkey, with an incidence of 0.54/100,000. The clinical manifestations of Tay-Sachs disease include progressive developmental delay, seizures, deafness, blindness, spasticity, and dystonia, which are caused by the accumulation of gangliosides in the central nervous system. To date, only one case indicating the association between Tay-Sachs disease and central precocious puberty has been reported. Although the mechanism of this association is not clear, it is thought to be due to ganglioside accumulation in the central nervous system or the inhibition of the hypothalamic inhibiting pathway. Herein, we report two patients with genetically proven Tay-Sachs disease who developed central precocious puberty during follow-up. Pubertal development in patients affected by Tay-Sachs disease should be carefully assessed."

    "title": "Insights into the genetic epidemiology of Crohn's and rare diseases in the Ashkenazi Jewish population.",
    "abstract": "As part of a broader collaborative network of exome sequencing studies, we developed a jointly called data set of 5,685 Ashkenazi Jewish exomes. We make publicly available a resource of site and allele frequencies, which should serve as a reference for medical genetics in the Ashkenazim (hosted in part at https://ibd.broadinstitute.org, also available in gnomAD at http://gnomad.broadinstitute.org). We estimate that 34% of protein-coding alleles present in the Ashkenazi Jewish population at frequencies greater than 0.2% are significantly more frequent (mean 15-fold) than their maximum frequency observed in other reference populations. Arising via a well-described founder effect approximately 30 generations ago, this catalog of enriched alleles can contribute to differences in genetic risk and overall prevalence of diseases between populations. As validation we document 148 AJ enriched protein-altering alleles that overlap with \"pathogenic\" ClinVar alleles (table available at https://github.com/macarthur-lab/clinvar/blob/master/output/clinvar.tsv), including those that account for 10-100 fold differences in prevalence between AJ and non-AJ populations of some rare diseases, especially recessive conditions, including Gaucher disease (GBA, p.Asn409Ser, 8-fold enrichment); Canavan disease (ASPA, p.Glu285Ala, 12-fold enrichment); and Tay-Sachs disease (HEXA, c.1421+1G>C, 27-fold enrichment; p.Tyr427IlefsTer5, 12-fold enrichment). We next sought to use this catalog, of well-established relevance to Mendelian disease, to explore Crohn's disease, a common disease with an estimated two to four-fold excess prevalence in AJ. We specifically attempt to evaluate whether strong acting rare alleles, particularly protein-truncating or otherwise large effect-size alleles, enriched by the same founder-effect, contribute excess genetic risk to Crohn's disease in AJ, and find that ten rare genetic risk factors in NOD2 and LRRK2 are enriched in AJ (p < 0.005), including several novel contributing alleles, show evidence of association to CD. Independently, we find that genomewide common variant risk defined by GWAS shows a strong difference between AJ and non-AJ European control population samples (0.97 s.d. higher, p<10-16). Taken together, the results suggest coordinated selection in AJ population for higher CD risk alleles in general. The results and approach illustrate the value of exome sequencing data in case-control studies along with reference data sets like ExAC (sites VCF available via FTP at ftp.broadinstitute.org/pub/ExAC_release/release0.3/) to pinpoint genetic variation that contributes to variable disease predisposition across populations."

    "abstract": "Tay-Sachs disease, caused by impaired β-N-acetylhexosaminidase activity, was the first GM2 gangliosidosis to be studied and one of the most severe and earliest lysosomal diseases to be described. The condition, associated with the pathological build-up of GM2 ganglioside, has acquired almost iconic status and serves as a paradigm in the study of lysosomal storage diseases. Inherited as a classical autosomal recessive disorder, this global disease of the nervous system induces developmental arrest with regression of attained milestones; neurodegeneration progresses rapidly to cause premature death in young children. There is no effective treatment beyond palliative care, and while the genetic basis of GM2 gangliosidosis is well established, the molecular and cellular events, from diseasecausing mutations and glycosphingolipid storage to disease manifestations, remain to be fully delineated. Several therapeutic approaches have been attempted in patients, including enzymatic augmentation, bone marrow transplantation, enzyme enhancement, and substrate reduction therapy. Hitherto, none of these stratagems has materially altered the course of the disease. Authentic animal models of GM2 gangliodidosis have facilitated in-depth evaluation of innovative applications such as gene transfer, which in contrast to other interventions, shows great promise. This review outlines current knowledge pertaining the pathobiology as well as potential innovative treatments for the GM2 gangliosidoses."

    "abstract": "G<sub>M2</sub> gangliosides are a group of lysosomal lipid storage disorders that are due to mutations in <i>HEXA</i>, <i>HEXB</i> and <i>GM2A</i>. In our study, 10 patients with these diseases were enrolled, and Sanger sequencing was performed for the <i>HEXA</i> and <i>HEXB</i> genes. The results revealed one known splice site mutation (c.346+1G>A, IVS2+1G>A) and three novel mutations (a large deletion involving exons 6-10; one nucleotide deletion, c.622delG [p.D208Ifsx15]; and a missense mutation, c.919G>A [p.E307K]) in <i>HEXA</i>. In <i>HEXB</i>, one known mutation (c.1597C>T [p.R533C]) and one variant of uncertain significance (c.619A>G [p.I207V]) were identified. Five patients had c.1597C>T in <i>HEXB</i>, indicating a common mutation in south Iran. In this study, a unique large deletion in <i>HEXA</i> was identified as a homozygous state. To predict the cause of the large deletion in <i>HEXA</i>, RepeatMasker was used to investigate the <i>Alu</i> elements. In addition, to identify the breakpoint of this deletion, PCR was performed around these elements. Using Repeat masker, different <i>Alu</i> elements were identified across <i>HEXA</i>, mainly in intron 5 and intron 10 adjacent to the deleted exons. PCR around the <i>Alu</i> elements and Sanger sequencing revealed the start point of a large deletion in <i>Alu</i>Sz6 in the intron 6 and the end of its breakpoint 73 nucleotides downstream of <i>Alu</i>Jo in intron 10. Our study showed that <i>HEXA</i> is an <i>Alu</i>-rich gene that predisposes individuals to disease-associated large deletions due to these elements."

    "abstract": "Globally, about five per cent of children are born with congenital or genetic disorders. The most common autosomal recessive conditions are thalassaemia, sickle cell disease, cystic fibrosis and Tay-Sachs disease, with higher carrier rates in specific patient populations. Identifying and counselling couples at genetic risk of the conditions before pregnancy enables them to make fully informed reproductive decisions, with some of these choices not being available if genetic counselling is only offered in an antenatal setting. This is an update of a previously published review. To assess the effectiveness of systematic preconception genetic risk assessment to improve reproductive outcomes in women and their partners who are identified as carriers of thalassaemia, sickle cell disease, cystic fibrosis and Tay-Sachs disease in healthcare settings when compared to usual care. We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Trials Registers. In addition, we searched for all relevant trials from 1970 (or the date at which the database was first available if after 1970) to date using electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO), clinical trial databases (National Institutes of Health, Clinical Trials Search portal of the World Health Organization, metaRegister of controlled clinical trials), and hand searching of key journals and conference abstract books from 1998 to date (European Journal of Human Genetics, Genetics in Medicine, Journal of Community Genetics). We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles, reviews and guidelines and also contacted subject experts in the field to request any unpublished or other published trials.Date of latest search of the registers: 20 June 2017.Date of latest search of all other sources: 16 November 2017. Any randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials (published or unpublished) comparing reproductive outcomes of systematic preconception genetic risk assessment for thalassaemia, sickle cell disease, cystic fibrosis and Tay-Sachs disease when compared to usual care. We identified 25 papers, describing 16 unique trials which were potentially eligible for inclusion in the review. However, after assessment, no randomised controlled trials of preconception genetic risk assessment for thalassaemia, sickle cell disease, cystic fibrosis and Tay-Sachs disease were found. No randomised controlled trials of preconception genetic risk assessment for thalassaemia, sickle cell disease, cystic fibrosis and Tay-Sachs disease were included. One ongoing trial has been identified which may potentially eligible for inclusion once completed. As no randomised controlled trials of preconception genetic risk assessment for thalassaemia, sickle cell disease, cystic fibrosis, or Tay-Sachs disease were found for inclusion in this review, the research evidence for current policy recommendations is limited to non-randomised studies.Information from well-designed, adequately powered, randomised trials is desirable in order to make more robust recommendations for practice. However, such trials must also consider the legal, ethical, and cultural barriers to implementation of preconception genetic risk assessment."

    "abstract": "Sandhoff disease, one of the GM2 gangliosidoses, is a lysosomal storage disorder characterized by the absence of β-hexosaminidase A and B activity and the concomitant lysosomal accumulation of its substrate, GM2 ganglioside. It features catastrophic neurodegeneration and death in early childhood. How the lysosomal accumulation of ganglioside might affect the early development of the nervous system is not understood. Recently, cerebral organoids derived from induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells have illuminated early developmental events altered by disease processes. To develop an early neurodevelopmental model of Sandhoff disease, we first generated iPS cells from the fibroblasts of an infantile Sandhoff disease patient, then corrected one of the mutant <i>HEXB</i> alleles in those iPS cells using CRISPR/Cas9 genome-editing technology, thereby creating isogenic controls. Next, we used the parental Sandhoff disease iPS cells and isogenic <i>HEXB</i>-corrected iPS cell clones to generate cerebral organoids that modeled the first trimester of neurodevelopment. The Sandhoff disease organoids, but not the <i>HEXB</i>-corrected organoids, accumulated GM2 ganglioside and exhibited increased size and cellular proliferation compared with the <i>HEXB</i>-corrected organoids. Whole-transcriptome analysis demonstrated that development was impaired in the Sandhoff disease organoids, suggesting that alterations in neuronal differentiation may occur during early development in the GM2 gangliosidoses."

    "title": "Principles for interactions with biopharmaceutical companies: the development of guidelines for patient advocacy organizations in the field of rare diseases.",
    "abstract": "Rare diseases are a global public health concern, affecting an estimated 350 million individuals. Only 5% of approximately 7000 known rare diseases have a treatment, and only about half have a patient advocacy organization. Biopharmaceutical companies face complex challenges in developing treatments for rare diseases. Patient advocacy organizations may play a major role by positively influencing research and development, clinical trials, and regulations. Thus, collaboration among patient advocacy organizations and industry is essential to bring new therapeutics to patients. We identified an unmet need for guidelines on day-to-day decision-making by rare disease patient advocacy organizations when working with biopharmaceutical partners. We convened an Independent Expert Panel experienced in collaborations between patient advocacy organizations and biopharmaceutical companies (April 2017) to develop consensus guidelines for these relationships. The guidelines were based on an original version by the International Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva Association (IFOPA). The Expert Panel reviewed and broadened these to be applicable to all patient advocacy organizations. Comments on the draft Guidelines were provided first by Panel participants and subsequently by six independent experts from patient advocacy organizations and industry. The Panel comprised four experts from the rare disease community who lead patient advocacy organizations; three leaders who perform advocacy functions within biopharmaceutical companies; and two facilitators, both having leadership experience in rare diseases and industry. The finalized Guidelines consist of four main sections: Identification and Engagement With Companies, Patient Engagement and Patient Privacy, Financial Contributions, and Clinical Trial Communication and Support. The Guidelines address the daily considerations, choices, and consequences of patient advocacy organizations as they engage with biopharmaceutical companies, and offer recommendations for volunteer/paid leaders of the organizations on how to interact in a thoughtful, responsible, ethical way that engenders trust. These Guidelines recommend best practices and standards for interactions between patient advocacy organizations and industry that will ultimately have a positive effect on the development of novel treatments. Patient advocacy organizations will be provided free access to these Guidelines to help bring clarification to day-to-day decision-making around their interactions, and for use as a living document with the potential for regular revisions and updates."

    "abstract": "GM1-gangliosidosis and GM2-gangliosidosis (Tay-Sachs disease and Sandhoff disease) are unrelenting heritable neurodegenerative conditions of lysosomal ganglioside accumulation. Although progressive brain atrophy is characteristic, longitudinal quantification of specific brain structures has not been systematically studied. The goal of this longitudinal study has been to quantify and track brain MRI volume changes, including specific structure volume changes, at different times in disease progression of childhood gangliosidoses, and to explore quantitative brain MRI volumetry (qMRI) as a non-invasive marker of disease progression for future treatment trials. Brain qMRI studies were performed in 14 patients with gangliosidoses (9 infantile, 5 juvenile) yearly. Cerebellar cortex and white matter, caudate, putamen, corpus callosum, ventricles, total brain, and intracranial volumes were measured, as well as total brain volume. Age-matched controls were available for the patients with the juvenile phenotype. The infantile phenotype of all gangliosidoses showed a consistent pattern of macrocephaly and rapidly increasing intracranial MRI volume with both (a) brain tissue volume (cerebral cortex and other smaller structures) and (b) ventricular volume (P<0.01 for all). In contrast to apparent enlargement of the total brain volume, and chiefly the enlarged cerebral cortex, a subset of smaller brain substructures generally decreased in size: the corpus callosum, caudate and putamen became smaller with time. The volume of cerebellar cortex also decreased in patients with infantile GM1-gangliosidosis and juvenile GM1- and GM2-gangliosidosis; however, infantile GM2-gangliosidosis cerebellar cortex was the exception, increasing in size. Elevated intracranial pressure (estimated by lumbar spinal pressure) was a common finding in infantile disease and showed continued increases as the disease progressed, yet lacked MRI signs of hydrocephalus except for increasing ventricular size. Notably, in patients with juvenile gangliosidosis, macrocephaly and elevated intracranial pressure were absent and total brain volume decreased with time compared to controls (P=0.004). The disease course of infantile versus juvenile gangliosidoses is clearly distinguished by the rate of brain disease progression as characterized by qMRI. Assessments by qMRI represent a robust non-invasive method for monitoring CNS changes in the clinical course of gangliosidoses and is ideally suited to monitor effects of novel CNS-directed therapies in future clinical trials."

Late-onset Tay-Sachs disease variant is associated with a higher level of residual HexA activity. Treatment options are limited, and there are a few described cases who have undergone haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) with variable outcome.We describe a case of a 23-year-old male patient who presented with a long-standing tremor since 7 years of age. He had gait ataxia, a speech stammer and swallowing problems. His condition had had a static course apart from his tremor that had been gradually deteriorating. Because of the deterioration in his neurological function, the patient had an uneventful, matched-sibling donor bone marrow transplant at the age of 15 years. Eight years post-HSCT, at the age of 23, he retains full donor engraftment, and his white cell beta-HexA of 191 nmol/mg/h is comparable to normal controls (in-assay control = 187). He continues to experience some intentional tremor that is tolerable for daily life and nonprogressive since HSCT. HSCT is a potential treatment option which might arrest neurodegeneration in patients with LOTS."

    "abstract": "Sphingolipids, long thought to be passive components of biological membranes with merely a structural role, have proved throughout the past decade to be major players in the pathogenesis of many human diseases. The study and characterization of several genetic disorders like Fabry's and Tay Sachs, where sphingolipid metabolism is disrupted, leading to a systemic array of clinical symptoms, have indeed helped elucidate and appreciate the importance of sphingolipids and their metabolites as active signaling molecules. In addition to being involved in dynamic cellular processes like apoptosis, senescence and differentiation, sphingolipids are implicated in critical physiological functions such as immune responses and pathophysiological conditions like inflammation and insulin resistance. Interestingly, the kidneys are among the most sensitive organ systems to sphingolipid alterations, rendering these molecules and the enzymes involved in their metabolism, promising therapeutic targets for numerous nephropathic complications that stand behind podocyte injury and renal failure."

    "title": "Lysosomal storage diseases.",
    "abstract": "Lysosomes are cytoplasmic organelles that contain a variety of different hydrolases. A genetic deficiency in the enzymatic activity of one of these hydrolases will lead to the accumulation of the material meant for lysosomal degradation. Examples include glycogen in the case of Pompe disease, glycosaminoglycans in the case of the mucopolysaccharidoses, glycoproteins in the cases of the oligosaccharidoses, and sphingolipids in the cases of Niemann-Pick disease types A and B, Gaucher disease, Tay-Sachs disease, Krabbe disease, and metachromatic leukodystrophy. Sometimes, the lysosomal storage can be caused not by the enzymatic deficiency of one of the hydrolases, but by the deficiency of an activator protein, as occurs in the AB variant of GM2 gangliosidosis. Still other times, the accumulated lysosomal material results from failed egress of a small molecule as a consequence of a deficient transporter, as in cystinosis or Salla disease. In the last couple of decades, enzyme replacement therapy has become available for a number of lysosomal storage diseases. Examples include imiglucerase, taliglucerase and velaglucerase for Gaucher disease, laronidase for Hurler disease, idursulfase for Hunter disease, elosulfase for Morquio disease, galsulfase for Maroteaux-Lamy disease, alglucosidase alfa for Pompe disease, and agalsidase alfa and beta for Fabry disease. In addition, substrate reduction therapy has been approved for certain disorders, such as eliglustat for Gaucher disease. The advent of treatment options for some of these disorders has led to newborn screening pilot studies, and ultimately to the addition of Pompe disease and Hurler disease to the Recommended Uniform Screening Panel (RUSP) in 2015 and 2016, respectively."

    "abstract": "The GM2-activator protein (GM2-AP), revealed by Li et al. in 1973 in human liver, was initially identified as a protein cofactor that stimulated β-hexosaminidase A to hydrolyze N-acetylgalactosamine from GM2 ganglioside. This cofactor was found to be missing in human variant AB Tay-Sachs disease. Over the years, the GM2-AP has also been shown to be involved in kidney vesicular transport, lipid presentation by CD1 molecule to T-cells, and interaction of human sperm with zona pellucida. Since the expression of the GM2-AP via mRNA detection in mouse tissues was found to be the highest in testis, we became interested in the localization of the GM2-AP at cellular level in mouse testis during spermatogenesis. Using immunohistochemical analysis and electron microscopy, we found that the GM2-AP was predominantly localized in the basal cytoplasm and the attenuated processes of Sertoli cells. The stained structure appeared to be lysosomes. The most interesting finding was the association of the GM2-AP with the acrosomal apparatus in early spermatids. A modest to intense staining was observed in some acrosomal granules and acrosomal caps. The GM2-AP seemed to disappear from acrosomal caps in the later stage of spermatids, in which the nucleus became elongated and condensed. These results suggest that the GM2-AP may be involved in the normal functions of Sertoli cells and play important roles during the development of acrosomal caps in the early spermatids."

    "abstract": "Tay-Sachs disease is a severe lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations in Hexa, the gene that encodes for the α subunit of lysosomal β-hexosaminidase A (HEXA), which converts GM2 to GM3 ganglioside. Unexpectedly, Hexa<sup>-/-</sup> mice have a normal lifespan and show no obvious neurological impairment until at least one year of age. These mice catabolize stored GM2 ganglioside using sialidase(s) to remove sialic acid and form the glycolipid GA2, which is further processed by β-hexosaminidase B. Therefore, the presence of the sialidase (s) allows the consequences of the Hexa defect to be bypassed. To determine if the sialidase NEU3 contributes to GM2 ganglioside degradation, we generated a mouse model with combined deficiencies of HEXA and NEU3. The Hexa<sup>-/-</sup>Neu3<sup>-/-</sup> mice were healthy at birth, but died at 1.5 to 4.5months of age. Thin-layer chromatography and mass spectrometric analysis of the brains of Hexa<sup>-/-</sup>Neu3<sup>-/-</sup> mice revealed the abnormal accumulation of GM2 ganglioside. Histological and immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated cytoplasmic vacuolation in the neurons. Electron microscopic examination of the brain, kidneys and testes revealed pleomorphic inclusions of many small vesicles and complex lamellar structures. The Hexa<sup>-/-</sup>Neu3<sup>-/-</sup> mice exhibited progressive neurodegeneration with neuronal loss, Purkinje cell depletion, and astrogliosis. Slow movement, ataxia, and tremors were the prominent neurological abnormalities observed in these mice. Furthermore, radiographs revealed abnormalities in the skeletal bones of the Hexa<sup>-/-</sup>Neu3<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Thus, the Hexa<sup>-/-</sup>Neu3<sup>-/-</sup> mice mimic the neuropathological and clinical abnormalities of the classical early-onset Tay-Sachs patients, and provide a suitable model for the future pre-clinical testing of potential treatments for this condition."

All the Hex A-inhibiting iminosugars tested formed hydrogen bonds with Arg178, Asp322, Tyr421 and Glu462 and had the favorable cation-π interaction with Trp460. Among them, DMDP amide (6) proved to be the most potent competitive inhibitor with a K<sub>i</sub> value of 0.041 μM. We analyzed the dynamic properties of both DMDP amide (6) and DNJNAc (1) in aqueous solution using molecular dynamics (MD) calculations; the distance of the interaction between Asp322 and 3-OH and Glu323 and 6-OH was important for stable interactions with Hex A, reducing fluctuations in the plasticity of the active site. DMDP amide (6) dose-dependently increased intracellular Hex A activity in the G269S mutant cells and restored Hex A activity up to approximately 43% of the wild type level; this effect clearly exceeded the border line treatment for Tay-Sachs disease, which is regarded as 10-15% of the wild type level. This is a significantly greater effect than that of pyrimethamine, which is currently in Phase 2 clinical trials. DMDP amide (6), therefore, represents a new promising pharmacological chaperone candidate for the treatment of Tay-Sachs disease."

Determine the frequency of three mutations, known to be a major cause of three distinct Lysosomal Storage Diseases (LSDs). The following pre-requisites were met: each mutation accounted for over 55% of the disease alleles among previously reported unrelated patients, all three diseases were among the most prevalent LSDs in the population under study, they all involved devastating deterioration of the nervous system, lacked curative treatment and may be fatal in childhood or adolescence. The anonymous samples used in this study were representative of the whole population; mutations were tested by PCR based methods, positive results were further confirmed. The diseases studied were Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (Hurler, MIM 607014), Tay Sachs disease variant B1 (TS, MIM 272800) and Metachromatic Leukodystrophy (MLD, MIM 250100); the mutations were, respectively, p.W402X, p.R178C and c.465+1G>A.

The natural history of sheep TSD was characterized using serial neurological evaluations, 7 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging, echocardiograms, electrodiagnostics, and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers. Intracranial gene therapy was also tested using AAVrh8 monocistronic vectors encoding the α-subunit of Hex (TSD α) or a mixture of two vectors encoding both the α and β subunits separately (TSD α + β) injected at high (1.3 × 10<sup>13</sup> vector genomes) or low (4.2 × 10<sup>12</sup> vector genomes) dose. Delay of symptom onset and/or reduction of acquired symptoms were noted in all adeno-associated virus-treated sheep. Postmortem evaluation showed superior HexA and vector genome distribution in the brain of TSD α + β sheep compared to TSD α sheep, but spinal cord distribution was low in all groups. Isozyme analysis showed superior HexA formation after treatment with both vectors (TSD α + β), and ganglioside clearance was most widespread in the TSD α + β high-dose sheep. Microglial activation and proliferation in TSD sheep-most prominent in the cerebrum-were attenuated after gene therapy. This report demonstrates therapeutic efficacy for TSD in the sheep brain, which is on the same order of magnitude as a child's brain."

MR scan of the brain showed isolated cerebellar atrophy and formal neuropsychometric testing identified significant subclinical deficits in attention, processing speed and memory. We suspected a form of GM<sub>2</sub> gangliosidosis, and white cell enzyme analysis showed markedly reduced enzymatic activity of β-hexosaminidase A. Genetic testing subsequently revealed two heterozygous pathogenic mutations in the <i>HEXA</i> gene (c.1499delT p.(Leu500fs) and c.805G>A p.(Gly269Ser)), confirming the very rare diagnosis of adult-onset Tay-Sachs disease."

    "title": "GM2 Activator Deficiency Caused by a Homozygous Exon 2 Deletion in GM2A.",
    "abstract": "GM2 activator (GM2A) deficiency (OMIM 613109) is a rare lysosomal storage disorder, with onset typically in infancy or early childhood. Clinically, it is almost indistinguishable from Tay-Sachs disease (OMIM 272800) or Sandhoff disease (OMIM 268800); however, traditionally available biochemical screening tests will most likely reveal normal results. We report a 2-year-old male with initially normal development until the age of 9 months, when he presented with developmental delay and regression. Workup at that time was unrevealing; at 15 months, he had abnormal brain MRI findings and a cherry red spot on ophthalmological examination. Family history and all laboratory studies were uninformative. The combination of a cherry red spot and developmental regression was strongly suggestive of a lysosomal storage disorder. Sequence analysis of GM2A did not reveal any pathogenic variants; however, exon 2 of GM2A could not be amplified by PCR, raising suspicion for a large, homozygous deletion. Subsequent copy number analysis confirmed a homozygous deletion of exon 2 in GM2A. This is the first reported case of GM2A deficiency being caused by a whole exon deletion. We describe previously unreported electron microscopy findings in this disease, thus expanding the clinical and variant spectrum for GM2 activator deficiency. These findings demonstrate the increased degree of suspicion required for diagnosis of this rare disorder. Brief Summary: This case of GM2 activator deficiency was caused by a homozygous deletion in GM2A, demonstrating the need to include exon level copy number analysis in any workup to fully exclude this disorder."

Pyrimethamine as a pharmacological chaperone was used to increase β-hexosaminidase A activity in this patient. We describe a patient with Tay-Sachs disease from the Indian population, a juvenile case who presented with developmental regression starting at the age of three, initially with motor followed by language regression. She is currently incapacitated with severe behavioral issues. This brief communication gives an insight into the efficacy of pharmacological chaperones. It also describes two unreported mutations in hexosaminidase A gene from the Indian population. After commencing Pyrimethamine, though initial benefits with increase in levels corresponded with briefly halting the motor regression, the observed increase was only transient and not associated with discernible beneficial neurological or psychiatric effects."

    "title": "Infantile gangliosidoses: Mapping a timeline of clinical changes.",
    "abstract": "Infantile gangliosidoses include GM1 gangliosidosis and GM2 gangliosidosis (Tay-Sachs disease, Sandhoff disease). To date, natural history studies in infantile GM2 (iGM2) have been retrospective and conducted through surveys. Compared to iGM2, there is even less natural history information available on infantile GM1 disease (iGM1). There are no approved treatments for infantile gangliosidoses. Substrate reduction therapy using miglustat has been tried, but is limited by gastrointestinal side effects. Development of effective treatments will require identification of meaningful outcomes in the setting of rapidly progressive and fatal diseases. This study aimed to establish a timeline of clinical changes occurring in infantile gangliosidoses, prospectively, to: 1) characterize the natural history of these diseases; 2) improve planning of clinical care; and 3) identify meaningful future treatment outcome measures. Patients were evaluated prospectively through ongoing clinical care. Twenty-three patients were evaluated: 8 infantile GM1, 9 infantile Tay-Sachs disease, 6 infantile Sandhoff disease. Common patterns of clinical change included: hypotonia before 6months of age; severe motor skill impairment within first year of life; seizures; dysphagia and feeding-tube placement before 18months of age. Neurodevelopmental testing scores reached the floor of the testing scale by 20 to 28months of age. Vertebral beaking, kyphosis, and scoliosis were unique to patients with infantile GM1. Chest physiotherapy was associated with increased survival in iGM1 (p=0.0056). Miglustat combined with a low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet (the Syner-G regimen) in patients who received a feeding-tube was associated with increased survival in infantile GM1 (p=0.025). This is the first prospective study of the natural history of infantile gangliosidoses and the very first natural history of infantile GM1. The homogeneity of the infantile gangliosidoses phenotype as demonstrated by the clinical events timeline in this study provides promising secondary outcome measure candidates. This study indicates that overall survival is a meaningful primary outcome measure for future clinical trials due to reliable timing and early occurrence of this event. Combination therapy approaches, instead of monotherapy approaches, will likely be the best way to optimize clinical outcomes. Combination therapy approaches include palliative therapies (e.g., chest physiotherapy) along with treatments that address the underlying disease pathology (e.g. miglustat or future gene therapies)."

Metabolic blocks in processing and catabolism of gangliosides result in the development of severe neurologic disorders, including gangliosidoses manifesting with neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation. We demonstrate that 2 mammalian enzymes, neuraminidases 3 and 4, play important roles in catabolic processing of brain gangliosides by cleaving terminal sialic acid residues in their glycan chains. In neuraminidase 3 and 4 double-knockout mice, G<sub>M3</sub> ganglioside is stored in microglia, vascular pericytes, and neurons, causing micro- and astrogliosis, neuroinflammation, accumulation of lipofuscin bodies, and memory loss, whereas their cortical and hippocampal neurons have lower rate of neuritogenesis <i>in vitro</i> Double-knockout mice also have reduced levels of G<sub>M1</sub> ganglioside and myelin in neuronal axons. Furthermore, neuraminidase 3 deficiency drastically increased storage of G<sub>M2</sub> in the brain tissues of an asymptomatic mouse model of Tay-Sachs disease, a severe human gangliosidosis, indicating that this enzyme is responsible for the metabolic bypass of β-hexosaminidase A deficiency. Together, our results provide the first <i>in vivo</i> evidence that neuraminidases 3 and 4 have important roles in CNS function by catabolizing gangliosides and preventing their storage in lipofuscin bodies.-Pan, X., De Britto Pará De Aragão, C., Velasco-Martin, J.

In this study, a plaque phantom is developed and characterized that provides a platform for establishing a uniform imaging approach for ICAD. A patient specific injection mold was 3D printed to construct a geometrically accurate ICAD phantom. Polyvinyl alcohol hydrogel was infused into the core shell mold to form the stenotic artery. The ICAD phantom incorporated materials mimicking a stenotic vessel and plaque components, including fibrous cap and lipid core. Two phantoms were scanned using high resolution cone beam CT and compared with four different 3 T MRI systems across eight different sites over a period of 18 months. Inter-phantom variability was assessed by lumen dimensions and contrast to noise ratio (CNR). Quantitative evaluation of the minimum lumen radius in the stenosis showed that the radius was on average 0.80 mm (95% CI 0.77 to 0.82 mm) in model 1 and 0.77 mm (95% CI 0.74 to 0.81 mm) in model 2. The highest CNRs were observed for comparisons between lipid and vessel wall. To evaluate manufacturing reproducibility, the CNR variability between the two models had an average absolute difference of 4.31 (95% CI 3.82 to 5.78). Variation in CNR between the images from the same scanner separated by 7 months was 2.5-6.2, showing reproducible phantom durability. A plaque phantom composed of a stenotic vessel wall and plaque components was successfully constructed for multicenter high resolution MRI standardization."

    "abstract": "Carrier screening is a term used to describe genetic testing that is performed on an individual who does not have any overt phenotype for a genetic disorder but may have one variant allele within a gene(s) associated with a diagnosis. Information about carrier screening should be provided to every pregnant woman. Carrier screening and counseling ideally should be performed before pregnancy because this enables couples to learn about their reproductive risk and consider the most complete range of reproductive options. A patient may decline any or all screening. When an individual is found to be a carrier for a genetic condition, his or her relatives are at risk of carrying the same mutation. The patient should be encouraged to inform his or her relatives of the risk and the availability of carrier screening. If an individual is found to be a carrier for a specific condition, the patient's reproductive partner should be offered testing in order to receive informed genetic counseling about potential reproductive outcomes. If both partners are found to be carriers of a genetic condition, genetic counseling should be offered. What follows is a detailed discussion of some of the more common genetic conditions for which carrier screening is recommended in at least some segments of the population."

    "abstract": "Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are the most fundamental internal causes for many genetic diseases. However, the location information on SNPs in a specific DNA sequence is not well acquired through current SNPs detection methods, except for accurate DNA sequencing. Here we report a fluorescence enhancement phenomenon in the process of two silver nanoclusters (AgNCs) approaching closely to form a nanocluster dimer (NCD). The fluorescence intensity is sensitive to the distance between two AgNCs; therefore, the NCD lights into different fluorescence intensities upon binding SNPs targets with mismatched bases at different positions. Interestingly, the fluorescence intensities of the NCD decrease linearly when the position of single mismatched base moves gradually from the middle point to the end of the target DNA. The NCD is a single probe acting as a universal platform to pinpoint various SNP positions. With this single probe, we cannot only identify the existence of SNPs but also pinpoint the location of a specific single mismatched base in the adjacent positions. This strategy is feasible to detect specific gene point mutations in clinical samples."

Patients are afflicted primarily with progressive central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction. Studies in mice, cats, and sheep have indicated safety and widespread distribution of Hex in the CNS after intracranial vector infusion of AAVrh8 vectors encoding species-specific Hex α- or β-subunits at a 1:1 ratio. Here, a safety study was conducted in cynomolgus macaques (cm), modeling previous animal studies, with bilateral infusion in the thalamus as well as in left lateral ventricle of AAVrh8 vectors encoding cm Hex α- and β-subunits. Three doses (3.2 × 10<sup>12</sup> vg [n = 3]; 3.2 × 10<sup>11</sup> vg [n = 2]; or 1.1 × 10<sup>11</sup> vg [n = 2]) were tested, with controls infused with vehicle (n = 1) or transgene empty AAVrh8 vector at the highest dose (n = 2). Most monkeys receiving AAVrh8-cmHexα/β developed dyskinesias, ataxia, and loss of dexterity, with higher dose animals eventually becoming apathetic. Time to onset of symptoms was dose dependent, with the highest-dose cohort producing symptoms within a month of infusion. One monkey in the lowest-dose cohort was behaviorally asymptomatic but had magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities in the thalami. Histopathology was similar in all monkeys injected with AAVrh8-cmHexα/β, showing severe white and gray matter necrosis along the injection track, reactive vasculature, and the presence of neurons with granular eosinophilic material. Lesions were minimal to absent in both control cohorts. Despite cellular loss, a dramatic increase in Hex activity was measured in the thalamus, and none of the animals presented with antibody titers against Hex. The high overexpression of Hex protein is likely to blame for this negative outcome, and this study demonstrates the variations in safety profiles of AAVrh8-Hexα/β intracranial injection among different species, despite encoding for self-proteins."

    "abstract": "GM2 gangliosidoses are a group of lysosomal storage disorders which include Sandhoff disease and Tay-Sachs disease. Dysregulation of glutamate receptors has been recently postulated in the pathology of Sandhoff disease. Glutamate receptor association with neuronal pentraxins 1 and 2, and the neuronal pentraxin receptor facilitates receptor potentiation and synaptic shaping. In this study, we have observed an upregulation of a novel form of neuronal pentraxin 1 (NP1-38) in the brains of a mouse model of Sandhoff disease and Tay-Sachs disease. In order to determine the impact of NP1 on the pathophysiology of Sandhoff disease mouse models, we have generated an Np1-/-Hexb-/- double knockout mouse, and observed extended lifespan, improved righting reflex and enhanced body condition relative to Hexb-/- mice, with no effect on gliosis or apoptotic markers in the CNS. Sandhoff mouse brain slices reveals a reduction in AMPA receptor-mediated currents, and increased variability in total glutamate currents in the CA1 region of the hippocampus; Np1-/-Hexb-/- mice show a correction of this phenotype, suggesting NP1-38 may be interfering with glutamate receptor function. Indeed, some of the psychiatric aspects of Sandhoff and Tay-Sachs disease (particularly late onset) may be attributed to a dysfunctional hippocampal glutamatergic system. Our work highlights a potential role for synaptic proteins, such as NP1 and glutamate receptors in lysosomal storage diseases."

    "abstract": "Glycosphingolipids and sphingolipids of cellular plasma membranes (PMs) reach luminal intra-lysosomal vesicles (LVs) for degradation mainly by pathways of endocytosis. After a sorting and maturation process (e.g. degradation of sphingomyelin (SM) and secretion of cholesterol), sphingolipids of the LVs are digested by soluble enzymes with the help of activator (lipid binding and transfer) proteins. Inherited defects of lipid-cleaving enzymes and lipid binding and transfer proteins cause manifold and fatal, often neurodegenerative diseases. The review summarizes recent findings on the regulation of sphingolipid catabolism and cholesterol secretion from the endosomal compartment by lipid modifiers, an essential stimulation by anionic membrane lipids and an inhibition of crucial steps by cholesterol and SM. Reconstitution experiments in the presence of all proteins needed, hydrolase and activator proteins, reveal an up to 10-fold increase of ganglioside catabolism just by the incorporation of anionic lipids into the ganglioside carrying membranes, whereas an additional incorporation of cholesterol inhibits GM2 catabolism substantially. It is suggested that lipid and other low molecular modifiers affect the genotype-phenotype relationship observed in patients with lysosomal diseases."

    "abstract": "Loss of function of the enzyme β-hexosaminidase A (HexA) causes the lysosomal storage disorder Tay-Sachs disease (TSD). It has been proposed that mutations in the α chain of HexA can impair folding, enzyme assembly, and/or trafficking, yet there is surprisingly little known about the mechanisms of these potential routes of pathogenesis. We therefore investigated the biosynthesis and trafficking of TSD-associated HexA α mutants, seeking to identify relevant cellular quality control mechanisms. The α mutants E482K and G269S are defective in enzymatic activity, unprocessed by lysosomal proteases, and exhibit altered folding pathways compared with wild-type α. E482K is more severely misfolded than G269S, as observed by its aggregation and inability to associate with the HexA β chain. Importantly, both mutants are retrotranslocated from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the cytosol and are degraded by the proteasome, indicating that they are cleared via ER-associated degradation (ERAD). Leveraging these discoveries, we observed that manipulating the cellular folding environment or ERAD pathways can alter the kinetics of mutant α degradation. Additionally, growth of patient fibroblasts at a permissive temperature or with chemical chaperones increases cellular Hex activity by improving mutant α folding. Therefore modulation of the ER quality control systems may be a potential therapeutic route for improving some forms of TSD."

Four previous SOGC- Canadian College of Medical Geneticists (CCMG) guidelines are updated and merged into the current document. All maternity care (most responsible health provider [MRHP]) and paediatric providers; maternity nursing; nurse practitioner; provincial maternity care administrator; medical student; and postgraduate resident year 1-7. Fertile, sexually active females and their fertile, sexually active male partners who are either planning a pregnancy or are pregnant (preferably in the first trimester of pregnancy, but any gestational age is acceptable). Women and their partners will be able to obtain appropriate genetic carrier screening information and possible diagnosis of AR, AD, or XL disorders (preferably pre-conception), thereby allowing an informed choice regarding genetic carrier screening and reproductive options (e.g., prenatal diagnosis, preimplantation genetic diagnosis, egg or sperm donation, or adoption). Informed reproductive decisions related to genetic carrier screening and reproductive outcomes based on family history, ethnic background, past obstetrical history, known carrier status, or genetic diagnosis. SOGC REPRODUCTIVE CARRIER SCREENING SUMMARY STATEMENT (2016): Pre-conception or prenatal education and counselling for reproductive carrier screening requires a discussion about testing within the three perinatal genetic carrier screening/diagnosis time periods, which include pre-conception, prenatal, and neonatal for conditions currently being screened for and diagnosed. This new information should be added to the standard reproductive carrier screening protocols that are already being utilized by the most responsible maternity provider through the informed consent process with the patient.

Validation of articles was completed by primary authors RD Wilson and I De Bie. Benefits are to provide an evidenced based reproductive genetic carrier screening update consensus based on international opinions and publications for the use of Canadian women, who are planning a pregnancy or who are pregnant and have been identified to be at risk (personal or male partner family or reproductive history) for the transmission of a clinically significant genetic condition to their offspring with associated morbidity and/or mortality. Harm may arise from having counselling and informed testing of the carrier status of the mother, their partner, or their fetus, as well as from declining to have this counselling and informed testing or from not having the opportunity for counselling and informed testing. Costs will ensue both from the provision of opportunities for counselling and testing, as well as when no such opportunities are offered or are declined and the birth of a child with a significant inherited condition and resulting morbidity/mortality occurs; these comprise not only the health care costs to the system but also the social/financial/psychological/emotional costs to the family. These recommendations are based on expert opinion and have not been subjected to a health economics assessment and local or provincial implementation will be required. This guideline is an update of four previous joint SOGC-CCMG Genetic Screening Guidelines dated 2002, 2006, 2008, and 2008 developed by the SOGC Genetic Committee in collaboration with the CCMG Prenatal Diagnosis Committee (now Clinical Practice Committee). 2016 CARRIER SCREENING RECOMMENDATIONS."

Pseudodeficiency is mostly caused by some non-pathogenic changes in the corresponding gene. These changes lead to the in vitro lability of the enzyme molecule, whereas in vivo the enzyme retains its functional activity. To assess the prevalence of the most common lysosomal hydrolases pseudodeficiency alleles in Ukraine, we have determined the frequency of alleles c.1055A>G and c.* 96A>G in the ARSA gene, substitutions c.739C>T (R247W) and c.745C>T (R249W) in the HEXA gene, c.1726G>A (G576S) and c.2065G>A (E689K) in the GAA gene, c.937G>T (D313Y) in the GLA1 gene and c.898G>A (A300T) in the IDUA gene in a group of 117 healthy individuals from different regions of the country and 14 heterozygous carriers of pathogenic mutations in the HEXA gene (parents of children with confirmed diagnosis of Tay-Sachs disease). The total frequency of haplotypes, associated with arylsulfatase A pseudodeficiency, in healthy people in Ukraine (c.1055G/c.*96G and c.1055G/c.*96A haplotypes) was 10.3%. The frequency of c.739C>T (R247W) allele, associated with hexo­saminidase A pseudodeficiency, among Tay-Sachs carriers from Ukraine was 7.1%. The total frequency of α-glucosidase pseudodeficiency haplotypes in healthy individuals in Ukraine (c.1726A/c.2065A and c.1726G/c.2065A haplotypes) was 2.6%. No person among examined individuals with the substitution c.937G>T (D313Y) in the GLA1 gene and c.898G>A (A300T) in the IDUA gene was found. The differential diagnostics of lysosomal storage diseases requires obligatory determination of the presence of the pseudodeficiency alleles, particularly the ones with high incidence in the total population. Ignoring phenomenon of pseudodeficiency may lead to serious diagnostic errors."

    "abstract": "In neurological disorders, pathological lesions in the central nervous system (CNS) may be globally dispersed throughout the brain or localized to specific regions. Although native neural stem cells (NSCs) are present in the adult mammalian brain, intrinsic self-repair of injured adult CNS tissue is inadequate or ineffective. The brain's poor regenerative ability may be due to the fact that NSCs are restricted to discrete locations, are few in number, or are surrounded by a microenvironment that does not support neuronal differentiation. Therapeutic potential of NSC transplantation in CNS diseases characterized by global degeneration requires that gene products and/or replaced cells be widely distributed. Global degenerative CNS diseases include inherited pediatric neurodegenerative diseases (inborn errors of metabolism, including lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs), such as Tay-Sachs-related Sandhoff disease), hypoxic or ischemic encephalopathy, and some adult CNS diseases (such as multiple sclerosis). Both mouse and human NSCs express many chemokines and chemokine receptors (including CXCR4 and adhesion molecules, such as integrins, selectins, and immunoglobulins) that mediate homing to sources of inflammatory chemokines, such as SDF-1α. In mammalian brains of all ages, NSCs may be attracted even at a great distance to regions of neurodegeneration. Consequently, NSC transplantation presents a promising strategy for treating many CNS diseases."

    "abstract": "GM2 gangliosidosis, a subset of lysosomal storage disorders, is caused by a deficiency of the glycohydrolase, β-N-acetylhexosaminidase, and includes the closely related Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff diseases. The enzyme deficiency prevents the normal, stepwise degradation of ganglioside, which accumulates unchecked within the cellular lysosome, particularly in neurons. As a result, individuals with GM2 gangliosidosis experience progressive neurological diseases including motor deficits, progressive weakness and hypotonia, decreased responsiveness, vision deterioration, and seizures. Mice and cats are well-established animal models for Sandhoff disease, whereas Jacob sheep are the only known laboratory animal model of Tay-Sachs disease to exhibit clinical symptoms. Since the human diseases are relatively rare, animal models are indispensable tools for further study of pathogenesis and for development of potential treatments. Though no effective treatments for gangliosidoses currently exist, animal models have been used to test promising experimental therapies. Herein, the utility and limitations of gangliosidosis animal models and how they have contributed to the development of potential new treatments are described."

    "abstract": "Abstract During the last two decades prenatal genetic screening and diagnosis has become the cornerstone of medical care for family planning to prevent genetic disease. Carrier screening programs for genetic disorders that are prevalent in various populations identify couples and pregnancies at risk of having an affected child. These couples can proceed with a choice of invasive prenatal diagnosis tests of the fetus (chorionic villous sampling and amniocentesis), or non-invasive prenatal testing of free fetal DNA circulation in the maternal blood which has emerged within the last few years and is currently available for fetal sexing for X Linked disorders. Despite the advances in prenatal diagnosis, couples found to have a fetus affected with a genetic disorder may need to face the dilemma of pregnancy termination. Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) is an alternative to preempt risk of having a child affected with a life-altering genetic disorder. This technique allows biopsy and genetic diagnosis of embryos obtained from in vitro fertilization by analysis of the genetic material from one or a few embryonic cells. Only unaffected embryos are returned to the mother to establish the pregnancy. We present our experience using PGD for four Lysosomal storage disorders: Tay Sachs, Gaucher type 1, Hunter and Fabry disease with some of the couples being carriers of more than one genetic disorder. PGD is applicable to most disorders for which the gene and the familial mutation are known and should be presented to couples as an alternative to invasive prenatal testing."

Enzymatic analysis (EA) has been suggested as the optimal carrier screening method, especially in non-Ashkenazi Jewish (non-AJ) individuals, but its utilization and efficacy have not been fully evaluated in the general population. This study assesses the reliability of EA in comparison with HEXA sequence analysis in non-AJ populations. Five hundred eight Hispanic and African American patients (516 samples) had EA of their leukocytes performed and 12 of these patients who tested positive by EA (\"carriers\") had subsequent HEXA gene sequencing performed. Of the 508 patients, 25 (4.9%) were EA positive and 40 (7.9%) were inconclusive. Of the 12 patients who were sequenced, 11 did not carry a pathogenic variant and one carried a likely deleterious mutation (NM_000520.4(HEXA):c.1510C>T). High inconclusive rates and poor correlation between positive/inconclusive enzyme results and identification of pathogenic mutations suggest that ethnic-specific recalibration of reference ranges for EA may be necessary. Alternatively, HEXA gene sequencing could be performed."

    "abstract": "GM2 gangliosidoses are autosomal recessive lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) caused by mutations in the <i>HEXA</i>, <i>HEXB</i> and <i>GM2A</i> genes, which encode the human lysosomal β-hexosaminidase (Hex) α- and β-subunits, and GM2 activator protein (GM2A), respectively. These diseases are associated with excessive accumulation of GM2 ganglioside (GM2) in the brains of patients with neurological symptoms. Here we established a CHO cell line overexpressing human <i>GM2A,</i> and purified GM2A from the conditioned medium, which was taken up by fibroblasts derived from a patient with GM2A deficiency, and had the therapeutic effects of reducing the GM2 accumulated in fibroblasts when added to the culture medium. We also demonstrated for the first time that recombinant GM2A could enhance the replacement effect of human modified HexB (modB) with GM2-degrading activity, which is composed of homodimeric altered β-subunits containing a partial amino acid sequence of the α-subunit, including the GSEP loop necessary for binding to GM2A, on reduction of the GM2 accumulated in fibroblasts derived from a patient with Tay-Sachs disease, a HexA (αβ heterodimer) deficiency, caused by <i>HEXA</i> mutations. We predicted the same manner of binding of GM2A to the GSEP loop located in the modified HexB β-subunit to that in the native HexA α-subunit on the basis of the x-ray crystal structures. These findings suggest the effectiveness of combinational replacement therapy involving the human modified HexB and GM2A for GM2 gangliosidoses."

    "title": "Systemic Gene Transfer of a Hexosaminidase Variant Using an scAAV9.47 Vector Corrects GM2 Gangliosidosis in Sandhoff Mice.",
    "abstract": "GM2 gangliosidosis is a group of neurodegenerative diseases caused by β-hexosaminidase A (HexA) enzyme deficiency. There is currently no cure. HexA is composed of two similar, nonidentical subunits, α and β, which must interact with the GM2 activator protein (GM2AP), a substrate-specific cofactor, to hydrolyze GM2 ganglioside. Mutations in either subunit or the activator can result in the accumulation of GM2 ganglioside within neurons throughout the central nervous system. The resulting neuronal cell death induces the primary symptoms of the disease: motor impairment, seizures, and sensory impairments. This study assesses the long-term effects of gene transfer in a Sandhoff (β-subunit knockout) mouse model. The study utilized a modified human β-hexosaminidase α-subunit (μ-subunit) that contains critical sequences from the β-subunit that enables formation of a stable homodimer (HexM) and interaction with GM2AP to hydrolyze GM2 ganglioside. We investigated a self-complementary adeno-associated viral (scAAV) vector expressing HexM, through intravenous injections of the neonatal mice. We monitored one cohort for 8 weeks and another cohort long-term for survival benefit, behavioral, biochemical, and molecular analyses. Untreated Sandhoff disease (SD) control mice reached a humane endpoint at approximately 15 weeks, whereas treated mice had a median survival age of 40 weeks, an approximate 2.5-fold survival advantage. On behavioral tests, the treated mice outperformed their knockout age-matched controls and perform similarly to the heterozygous controls. Through the enzymatic and GM2 ganglioside analyses, we observed a significant decrease in the GM2 ganglioside level, even though the enzyme levels were not significantly increased. Molecular analyses revealed a global distribution of the vector between brain and spinal cord regions. In conclusion, the neonatal delivery of a novel viral vector expressing the human HexM enzyme is effective in ameliorating the SD mouse phenotype for long-term. Our data could have implications not only for treatment of SD but also for Tay-Sachs disease (α-subunit deficiency) and similar brain disorders."

    "title": "Novel Vector Design and Hexosaminidase Variant Enabling Self-Complementary Adeno-Associated Virus for the Treatment of Tay-Sachs Disease.",
    "abstract": "GM2 gangliosidosis is a family of three genetic neurodegenerative disorders caused by the accumulation of GM2 ganglioside (GM2) in neuronal tissue. Two of these are due to the deficiency of the heterodimeric (α-β), \"A\" isoenzyme of lysosomal β-hexosaminidase (HexA). Mutations in the α-subunit (encoded by HEXA) lead to Tay-Sachs disease (TSD), whereas mutations in the β-subunit (encoded by HEXB) lead to Sandhoff disease (SD). The third form results from a deficiency of the GM2 activator protein (GM2AP), a substrate-specific cofactor for HexA. In their infantile, acute forms, these diseases rapidly progress with mental and psychomotor deterioration resulting in death by approximately 4 years of age. After gene transfer that overexpresses one of the deficient subunits, the amount of HexA heterodimer formed would empirically be limited by the availability of the other endogenous Hex subunit. The present study used a new variant of the human HexA α-subunit, μ, incorporating critical sequences from the β-subunit that produce a stable homodimer (HexM) and promote functional interactions with the GM2AP- GM2 complex. We report the design of a compact adeno-associated viral (AAV) genome using a synthetic promoter-intron combination to allow self-complementary (sc) packaging of the HEXM gene. Also, a previously published capsid mutant, AAV9.47, was used to deliver the gene to brain and spinal cord while having restricted biodistribution to the liver. The novel capsid and cassette design combination was characterized in vivo in TSD mice for its ability to efficiently transduce cells in the central nervous system when delivered intravenously in both adult and neonatal mice. This study demonstrates that the modified HexM is capable of degrading long-standing GM2 storage in mice, and it further demonstrates the potential of this novel scAAV vector design to facilitate widespread distribution of the HEXM gene or potentially other similar-sized genes to the nervous system."

Carrier screening has traditionally been performed by targeted mutation analysis for founder mutations with an enzyme assay for Tay-Sachs carrier detection. The development of next-generation sequencing (NGS) allows for higher detection rates regardless of ethnicity. Here, we explore differences in carrier detection rates between genotyping and NGS in a primarily Jewish population. Peripheral blood samples or saliva samples were obtained from 506 individuals. All samples were analyzed by sequencing, targeted genotyping, triplet-repeat detection, and copy-number analysis; the analyses were carried out at Counsyl. Of 506 individuals screened, 288 were identified as carriers of at least 1 condition and 8 couples were carriers for the same disorder. A total of 434 pathogenic variants were identified. Three hundred twelve variants would have been detected via genotyping alone. Although no additional mutations were detected by NGS in diseases routinely screened for in the Ashkenazi Jewish population, 26.5% of carrier results and 2 carrier couples would have been missed without NGS in the larger panel. In a primarily Jewish population, NGS reveals a larger number of pathogenic variants and provides individuals with valuable information for family planning.Genet Med 18 12, 1214-1217."

There are no effective treatments for these diseases; however, various strategies aimed at restoring β-hexosaminidase A have been explored. Here, we produced a modified human hexosaminidase subunit β (HexB), which we have termed mod2B, composed of homodimeric β subunits that contain amino acid sequences from the α subunit that confer GM2 ganglioside-degrading activity and protease resistance. We also developed fluorescent probes that allow visualization of endocytosis of mod2B via mannose 6-phosphate receptors and delivery of mod2B to lysosomes in GM2 gangliosidosis models. In addition, we applied imaging mass spectrometry to monitor efficacy of this approach in Sandhoff disease model mice. Following i.c.v. administration, mod2B was widely distributed and reduced accumulation of GM2, asialo-GM2, and bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate in brain regions including the hypothalamus, hippocampus, and cerebellum. Moreover, mod2B administration markedly improved motor dysfunction and a prolonged lifespan in Sandhoff disease mice. Together, the results of our study indicate that mod2B has potential for intracerebrospinal fluid enzyme replacement therapy and should be further explored as a gene therapy for GM2 gangliosidoses."

    "abstract": "Tay-Sachs or Sandhoff disease result from mutations in either the evolutionarily related HEXA or HEXB genes encoding respectively, the α- or β-subunits of β-hexosaminidase A (HexA). Of the three Hex isozymes, only HexA can interact with its cofactor, the GM2 activator protein (GM2AP), and hydrolyze GM2 ganglioside. A major impediment to establishing gene or enzyme replacement therapy based on HexA is the need to synthesize both subunits. Thus, we combined the critical features of both α- and β-subunits into a single hybrid µ-subunit that contains the α-subunit active site, the stable β-subunit interface and unique areas in each subunit needed to interact with GM2AP. To facilitate intracellular analysis and the purification of the µ-homodimer (HexM), CRISPR-based genome editing was used to disrupt the HEXA and HEXB genes in a Human Embryonic Kidney 293 cell line stably expressing the µ-subunit. In association with GM2AP, HexM was shown to hydrolyze a fluorescent GM2 ganglioside derivative both in cellulo and in vitro. Gene transfer studies in both Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff mouse models demonstrated that HexM expression reduced brain GM2 ganglioside levels."

Six months earlier, Rosa had left Minnesota with her husband and kids to visit their home and family in Mexico. Their 18-month-old, Manuelo, had been dying. He was diagnosed with the neurodegenerative condition Tay-Sachs disease. She had a second pregnancy that developed normally and I worried. Two days later, her baby, Luz was in my clinic and a blood test showed she had Tay-Sachs disease. Luz died on the way home after two days after Rosa' delivered her next baby. Rosa believed U.S. doctors were wrong. Manuelo didn't have Tay-Sachs. Manuelo's difficulties were from mal de ojo-the evil eye. Rosa told me that they had stopped Manuelo's antiseizure medications a month before his death, and he had seemed better, almost rolling over again. This improvement was strong evidence that mal de ojo had caused his problems. But it had been discovered too late, so Manuelo had died. Caught between wanting to respect their beliefs and worrying about the baby, I probed for any doubt in Rosa's thinking. During their last clinic visit, I asked Rosa how she understood what had happened to Manuelo and Luz. She still believed mal de ojo was responsible. It has been 9 years since that farewell. Recently, I heard from Rosa's extended family in Minnesota that Rosa, Pedro, and their kids are well and plan to return to Minnesota this year. I am looking forward to seeing them. My existence as a physician is dependent on and continually shaped by the patients and families that come to me for care. There is a lot in that process that is not in my control.

    "abstract": "Due to their capacity to inhibit hexosaminidases, 2-acetamido-1,2-dideoxy-iminosugars have been widely studied as potential therapeutic agents for various diseases. An efficient stereoselective synthesis of 2-acetamido-1,2-dideoxyallonojirimycin (DAJNAc), the most potent inhibitor of human placenta β-N-acetylglucosaminidase (β-hexosaminidase) among the epimeric series, is here described. This novel procedure can be easily scaled up, providing enough material for structural modifications and further biological tests. Thus, two series of sp(2)-iminosugar conjugates derived from DAJNAc have been prepared, namely monocyclic DAJNAc-thioureas and bicyclic 2-iminothiazolidines, and their glycosidase inhibitory activity evaluated. The data evidence the utmost importance of developing diversity-oriented synthetic strategies allowing optimization of electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions to achieve high inhibitory potencies and selectivities among isoenzymes. Notably, strong differences in the inhibition potency of the compounds towards β-hexosaminidase from human placenta (mature) or cultured fibroblasts (precursor form) were encountered. The ensemble of data suggests that the ratio between them, and not the inhibition potency towards the placenta enzyme, is a good indication of the chaperoning potential of TaySachs disease-associated mutant hexosaminidase."

Previous experimental and clinical studies have shown the importance of proper glycoprotein sialylation for the synaptic function and the occurrence of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) in the presence of sialylation deficiency in the CNS. Late-onset Tay Sachs disease (LOTSD) is a lysosomal disorder caused by mutations in the HEXA gene resulting in GM2-ganglioside storage in the CNS. It is characterized by progressive neurological impairment and high co-occurrence of psychiatric disturbances. We studied the N-glycome profile of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in a 14 year-old patient with GM2-gangliosidosis (LOTSD). At the age of 4, the patient presented regressive autism fulfilling criteria for childhood disintegrative disorder (CDD). A CSF sample was obtained in the course of diagnostic work-up for the suspicion of an underlying neurodegenerative disorder. We found definite changes of CSF N-glycans due to a dramatic decrease of sialylated biantennary and triantennary structures and an increase of asialo-core fucosylated bisected N-glycans. No changes of total plasma N-glycans were found. Herein findings highlight possible relationships between the early onset psychiatric disturbance featuring CDD in the patient and defective protein sialylation in the CNS. In conclusion, the study first shows aberrant N-glycan structures of CSF proteins in LOTSD; unveils possible pathomechanisms of GM2-gangliosidosis; supports existing relationships between neuropsychiatric disorders and unproper protein glycosylation in the CNS."

    "abstract": "Ganglioside GM2 is the major lysosomal storage compound of Tay-Sachs disease. It also accumulates in Niemann-Pick disease types A and B with primary storage of SM and with cholesterol in type C. Reconstitution of GM2 catabolism with β-hexosaminidase A and GM2 activator protein (GM2AP) at uncharged liposomal surfaces carrying GM2 as substrate generated only a physiologically irrelevant catabolic rate, even at pH 4.2. However, incorporation of anionic phospholipids into the GM2 carrying liposomes stimulated GM2 hydrolysis more than 10-fold, while the incorporation of plasma membrane stabilizing lipids (SM and cholesterol) generated a strong inhibition of GM2 hydrolysis, even in the presence of anionic phospholipids. Mobilization of membrane lipids by GM2AP was also inhibited in the presence of cholesterol or SM, as revealed by surface plasmon resonance studies. These lipids also reduced the interliposomal transfer rate of 2-NBD-GM1 by GM2AP, as observed in assays using Förster resonance energy transfer. Our data raise major concerns about the usage of recombinant His-tagged GM2AP compared with untagged protein. The former binds more strongly to anionic GM2-carrying liposomal surfaces, increases GM2 hydrolysis, and accelerates intermembrane transfer of 2-NBD-GM1, but does not mobilize membrane lipids."

This paper proposes the use of natality data and an imputation-based method to estimate age-specific mortality incidence rates in the face of this missing information. By utilizing previously determined probabilities of birth, a birth date and death date are imputed for every decedent in the dataset. Thus, the birth cohort of each individual is imputed, and the total on-study time can be calculated. This idea is implemented in two approaches for estimation of mortality incidence rates. The first is an extension of a person-time approach, while the second is an extension of a life table approach. Monte Carlo simulations showed that both approaches perform well in comparison to the ideal complete data methods, but that the person-time method is preferred. An application to Tay-Sachs disease is demonstrated. It is concluded that the imputation methods proposed provide valid estimates of the incidence of death from death certificate data without the need for additional assumptions under which usual mortality rates provide valid estimates."

For instance, it maintains the homeostasis of splicing factors and degrades aberrant transcripts of human genetic disease genes. Here we examine the inhibitory effect on the NMD pathway and consequent increase of PTC+ transcripts by the dietary compound curcumin. We have found that several PTC⁺ transcripts including that of serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 1 (SRSF1) were specifically increased in cells by curcumin. We also observed a similar curcumin effect on the PTC⁺ mutant transcript from a Tay-Sachs-causing HEXA allele or from a beta-globin reporter gene. The curcumin effect was accompanied by significantly reduced expression of the NMD factors UPF1, 2, 3A and 3B. Consistently, in chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, curcumin specifically reduced the occupancy of acetyl-histone H3 and RNA polymerase II at the promoter region (-376 to -247nt) of human UPF1, in a time- and dosage-dependent way. Importantly, knocking down UPF1 abolished or substantially reduced the difference of PTC(+) transcript levels between control and curcumin-treated cells. The disrupted curcumin effect was efficiently rescued by expression of exogenous Myc-UPF1 in the knockdown cells. Together, our data demonstrate that a group of PTC⁺ transcripts are stabilized by a dietary compound curcumin through the inhibition of UPF factor expression and the NMD pathway."

At the present time, no effective treatment exists for LOTS and other neurodegenerative diseases involving the central nerve system (CNS). Pyrimethamine (PMT) was previously shown to act as a HexA chaperone in human fibroblasts in vitro carrying some (e.g., αG269S), but not all LOTS-related mutations. The present study assessed the effect of cyclic, low dose and long term pyrimethamine treatment on HexA in subjects with LOTS. In an open label trial in 4 LOTS patients, PMT was initiated at an average daily dose of ~2.7 mg and administered cyclically guided by blood lymphocyte HexA activity for a mean duration of 82.8 (±22.5; SD) weeks (~1.5 year). HexA activity rose in all subjects, with a mean peak increase of 2.24 folds (±0.52; SD) over baseline activity (range 1.87-3). The mean treatment time required to attain this peak was of 15.7 (±4.8; SD) weeks. Following increase in activity, HexA gradually declined with the continued use of PMT, which was then stopped, resulting in the return of HexA activity to baseline. A second cycle of PMT treatment was then initiated, resulting again in an increase in HexA activity. Three of the patients experienced a measurable neuropsychiatric deterioration whereas one subject remained entirely stable. Cyclic low dose of PMT can increase HexA activity in LOTS patients. However, the observed increase is repeatedly transient and not associated with discernible beneficial neurological or psychiatric effects."

A critical question is whether this novel technology will contribute to elucidation of novel disease mechanisms or evaluation of therapeutic strategies. Here we have addressed this question by studying Tay-Sachs disease, a representative lysosomal storage disease, and Dravet syndrome, a form of severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy, using human iN cells with feature of immature postmitotic glutamatergic neuronal cells. In Tay-Sachs disease, we have successfully characterized canonical neuronal pathology, massive accumulation of GM2 ganglioside, and demonstrated the suitability of this novel cell culture for future drug screening. In Dravet syndrome, we have identified a novel functional phenotype that was not suggested by studies of classical mouse models and human autopsied brains. Taken together, the present study demonstrates that human iN cells are useful for translational neuroscience research to explore novel disease mechanisms and evaluate therapeutic compounds. In the future, research using human iN cells with well-characterized genomic landscape can be integrated into multidisciplinary patient-oriented research on neuropsychiatric disorders to address novel disease mechanisms and evaluate therapeutic strategies."

In short, we explore a number of genetic conditions, which carry some benefits in adverse circumstances including exposure to infectious agents. The examples discussed are conditions known to result in resistance to a specific infectious disease, or have been proposed as being associated with resistance to various infectious diseases. These infectious disease-genetic disorder pairings include malaria and hemoglobinopathies, cholera and cystic fibrosis, tuberculosis and Tay-Sachs disease, mycotic abortions and phenylketonuria, infection by enveloped viruses and disorders of glycosylation, infection by filoviruses and Niemann-Pick C1 disease, as well as rabies and myasthenia gravis. We also discuss two genetic conditions that lead to infectious disease hypersusceptibility, although we did not cover the large number of immunologic defects leading to infectious disease hypersusceptibilities. Four of the resistance-associated pairings (malaria/hemogloginopathies, cholera/cystic fibrosis, tuberculosis/Tay-Sachs, and mycotic abortions/phenylketonuria) appear to be a result of selection pressures in geographic regions in which the specific infectious agent is endemic. The other pairings do not appear to be based on selection pressure and instead may be serendipitous. Nonetheless, research investigating these relationships may lead to treatment options for the aforementioned diseases by exploiting established mechanisms between genetically affected cells and infectious organisms. This may prove invaluable as a starting point for research in the case of diseases that currently have no reliably curative treatments, <i>e.g</i>., HIV, rabies, and Ebola."

    "abstract": "Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) is a fatal, recessively inherited neurodegenerative condition of infancy and early childhood. Although rare in most other populations, the carrier frequency is one in 25 in Ashkenazi Jews. Australian high-school-based TSD preconception genetic screening programs aim to screen, educate, and optimize reproductive choice for participants. These programs have demonstrated high uptake, low psychological morbidity, and have been shown to result in fewer than expected Jewish TSD-affected births over 18 years of operation. The majority of Jewish individuals of reproductive age outside of the high school screening program setting in Australia have not accessed screening. Recent recommendations advocate supplementing the community high school screening programs with general practitioner- and obstetrician-led genetic screening of Ashkenazi Jewish individuals for TSD and other severe recessive diseases for which this group is at risk. Massively parallel DNA sequencing is expected to become the testing modality of choice over the coming years."

    "abstract": "Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) is a recessively inherited neurodegenerative disorder caused by mutations in the HEXA gene resulting in β-hexosaminidase A (HEX A) deficiency and neuronal accumulation of GM2 ganglioside. We describe the first patient with Tay-Sachs disease in the Cypriot population, a juvenile case which presented with developmental regression at the age of five. The diagnosis was confirmed by measurement of HEXA activity in plasma, peripheral leucocytes and fibroblasts. Sequencing the HEXA gene resulted in the identification of two previously described mutations: the nonsense mutation c.78G>A (p.Trp26X) and the silent mutation c.1305C>T (p.=). The silent mutation was reported once before in a juvenile TSD patient of West Indian origin with an unusually mild phenotype. The presence of this mutation in another juvenile TSD patient provides further evidence that it is a disease-causing mutation. Successful preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) and prenatal follow-up were provided to the couple."

The infantile forms are distinguished from the juvenile forms by age of onset, rate of disease progression, and age of death. There are no approved treatments for the gangliosidoses. In search of potential biomarkers of disease, we quantified 188 analytes in CSF and serum from living human patients with longitudinal (serial) measurements. Notably, several associated with inflammation were elevated in the CSF of infantile gangliosidosis patients, and less so in more slowly progressing forms of juvenile gangliosidosis, but not in MPS disease. Thirteen CSF and two serum biomarker candidates were identified. Five candidate biomarkers were distinguished by persistent elevation in the CSF of patients with the severe infantile phenotype: ENA-78, MCP-1, MIP-1α, MIP-1β, and TNFR2. Correspondence of abnormal elevation with other variables of disease-i.e., severity of clinical phenotype, differentiation from changes in serum, and lack of abnormality in other neurodegenerative lysosomal diseases-identifies these analytes as biomarkers of neuropathology specific to the gangliosidosis diseases."

We report on a girl with Prader-Willi syndrome and Tay-Sachs disease resulting from maternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 15. The child also had an isochromosome Xq. To further characterize the etiology of the aberrant chromosome 15 and the isochromosome Xq, SNP loci from both chromosomes were assessed in the proband and parents, and genome-wide DNA methylation analysis was performed. SNP and DNA methylation analysis confirmed maternal uniparental heterodisomy around the Prader-Willi locus, while the region around the HEXA locus showed maternal uniparental isodisomy. This result is consistent with trisomy rescue of a maternal meiosis l error in a chromosome 15 with two meiotic recombinations. SNP analysis of the X chromosomes is consistent with a maternal origin for the isochromosome."

Here we describe blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and electrodiagnostic methods for evaluating disease progression in the feline SD model and application of these approaches to assess AAV-mediated gene therapy. SD cats were treated by intracranial injections of the thalami combined with either the deep cerebellar nuclei or a single lateral ventricle using AAVrh8 vectors encoding feline Hex. Significantly altered in untreated SD cats, blood and CSF based biomarkers were largely normalized after AAV gene therapy. Also reduced after treatment were expansion of the lysosomal compartment in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and elevated activity of secondary lysosomal enzymes. MRI changes characteristic of the gangliosidoses were documented in SD cats and normalized after AAV gene therapy. The minimally invasive biomarkers reported herein should be useful to assess disease progression of untreated SD patients and those in future clinical trials."

    "abstract": "Tay-Sachs disease is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder occurring due to impaired activity of β-hexosaminidase-A (EC 3.2.1.52), resulting from the mutation in <i>HEXA</i> gene. Very little is known about the molecular pathology of TSD in Indian children except for a few mutations identified by us. The present study is aimed to determine additional mutations leading to Tay-Sachs disease in nine patients confirmed by the deficiency of β-hexosaminidase-A (< 2% of total hexosaminidase activity for infantile patients) in leucocytes. The enzyme activity was assessed by using substrates 4-methylumbelliferyl-N-acetyl-β-d-glucosamine and 4-methylumbelliferyl-N-acetyl-β-d-glucosamine-6-sulfate for total-hexosaminidase and hexosaminidase-A respectively, and heat inactivation method for carrier detection. The exons and exon-intron boundaries of the <i>HEXA</i> gene were bi-directionally sequenced on an automated sequencer. 'In silico' analyses for novel mutations were carried out using SIFT, Polyphen2 and MutationT@ster software programs. The structural study was carried out by UCSF Chimera software using the crystallographic structure of β-hexosaminidase-A (PDB-ID: 2GJX) as the template. Our study identified four novel mutations in three cases. These include a compound heterozygous missense mutation c.524A>C (D175A) and c.805G>C (p.G269R) in one case; and one small 1 bp deletion c.426delT (p.F142LfsX57) and one splice site mutation c.459+4A>C in the other two cases respectively. None of these mutations were detected in 100 chromosomes from healthy individuals of the same ethnic group. Three previously reported missense mutations, (i) c.532C>T (p.R178C), (ii) c.964G>T (p.D322Y), and (iii) c.1385A>T (p.E462V); two nonsense mutations (i) c.709C>T (p.Q237X) and (ii) c.1528C>T (p.R510X), one 4 bp insertion c.1277_1278insTATC (p.Y427IfsX5) and one splice site mutation c.459+5G>A were also identified in six cases. We observe from this study that novel mutations are more frequently observed in Indian patients with Tay-Sachs disease with clustering of ~ 73% of disease causing mutations in exons 5 to 12.

    "abstract": "Glycosphingolipids (GSLs) are information-rich glycoconjugates that occur in nature mainly as constituents of biomembranes. Each GSL contains a complex carbohydrate chain linked to a ceramide moiety that anchors the molecule to biomembranes. In higher animals, catabolism of GSLs takes place in lysosomes where sugar chains in GSLs are hydrolyzed by exo-glycosidases to cleave a sugar residue from the non-reducing end of a sugar chain. Inborn errors of GSL-catabolism, collectively called sphingolipidoses or GSL-storage diseases, are caused by the deficiency of exo-glycosidases responsible for the degradation of the specific sugar residues at the non-reducing termini in GSLs. This chapter briefly discusses glycone, anomeric, linkage, and aglycone specificities of exo-glycosidases and some of the historical landmarks on their associations with the chemical pathology of the five best known sphingolipidoses: GM1 gangliosidosis, GM2 gangliosidosis (Tay-Sachs disease), Fabry disease, Gaucher disease, and Krabbe disease."

Patients who were diagnosed withGM2-Gangliosidosis in the Neurology Department of Mofid Children's Hospital in Tehran, Iran from October 2009 to February 2014were included in our study. The disorder was confirmed by neurometabolic and enzyme level detection of hexosaminidases A, B, and AB in reference to Wagnester Laboratory in Germany. We assessed age, gender, past medical history, developmental status, clinical manifestations, and neuroimaging findings of 9 patients with Sandhoff disease and 9 with Tay Sachs disease. 83% of our patients were the offspring of consanguineous marriages. All of them had a developmental disorder as a chief complaint. 38%of patients had a history of developmental delay or regression and 22% had seizures. The patients with Sandhoff and Tay Sachs disease were followed for approximately 5 years and the follow-up showed all patients were bedridden or had expired due to refractory seizures, pneumonia aspiration, or swallowing disorders. Neuro-imaging findings included bilateral thalamic involvement, brain atrophy, and hypo myelination in near half of our patients (48%). According to the results of this study, we suggest that cherry-red spots, hyperacusis, refractory seizures, and relative parents in children with developmental delay and/or regression should be considered for assessment of GM2-Gangliosidosis disease."

Research revealed an essential role of sphingolipids and sphingolipid metabolites in glomerular disorders of genetic and non-genetic origin. The discovery that glucocerebrosides accumulate in Gaucher disease in glomerular cells and are associated with clinical proteinuria initiated intensive research into the function of other sphingolipids in glomerular disorders. The accumulation of sphingolipids in other genetic diseases including Tay-Sachs, Sandhoff, Fabry, hereditary inclusion body myopathy 2, Niemann-Pick, and nephrotic syndrome of the Finnish type and its implications with respect to glomerular pathology will be discussed. Similarly, sphingolipid accumulation occurs in glomerular diseases of non-genetic origin including diabetic kidney disease (DKD), HIV-associated nephropathy, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), and lupus nephritis. Sphingomyelin metabolites, such as ceramide, sphingosine, and sphingosine-1-phosphate have also gained tremendous interest. We recently described that sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase acid-like 3b (SMPDL3b) is expressed in podocytes where it modulates acid sphingomyelinase activity and acts as a master modulator of danger signaling. Decreased SMPDL3b expression in post-reperfusion kidney biopsies from transplant recipients with idiopathic FSGS correlates with the recurrence of proteinuria in patients and in experimental models of xenotransplantation. Increased SMPDL3b expression is associated with DKD. The consequences of differential SMPDL3b expression in podocytes in these diseases with respect to their pathogenesis will be discussed. Finally, the role of sphingolipids in the formation of lipid rafts in podocytes and their contribution to the maintenance of a functional slit diaphragm in the glomerulus will be discussed."

A total of 24.9% of neurologists and 31.9% of psychiatrists had discussed prenatal GT with patients, but 95.3% did not feel comfortable discussing PGD; only 2.9% discussed it, and only 1.8% had patients ask about PGD. Most would refer for PGD for Huntington's disease and Tay-Sachs disease, fewer for cystic fibrosis, and fewer still for autism, Alzheimer's disease, or gender selection for family balancing; in each of these cases, psychiatrists' percentages were higher than those of neurologists. Providers who would refer for PGD for Huntington's disease, cystic fibrosis, or gender selection differed from others in proportions of patients with insurance and were more likely to have undergone a GT themselves and be concerned about discrimination. These data, the first to examine how neurologists and psychiatrists view PGD, suggest that they do not feel comfortable discussing PGD but have strong views about its use. Potential PGD use is associated with concerns about discrimination and less experience with GT. These data highlight the need for enhancing education about these technologies among various providers."

First, we describe the development of thought about diversity through the 20th century and through more modern studies including genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and next-generation sequencing. We introduce several examples, such as sickle cell anemia and Tay-Sachs disease that are caused by rare mutations and are more frequent in certain geographical populations, and common treatment responses that are caused by common variants, such as hepatitis C infection. We conclude with comments about the continued relevance of human genetic diversity in medical genetics and personalized medicine more generally."

However, in the broader Australian community TSD screening is not systematically performed and cases still occur in unscreened AJ individuals. In order to improve the effectiveness of Australian screening, there is a need for definitive guidelines for healthcare professionals to facilitate extension of the proven benefits of preconception TSD screening to all AJ individuals at risk. We performed a systematic review of the relevant literature relating to AJ pre-conception and antenatal screening for TSD. The evidence was assessed using an established National Health and Medical Research Council evidence grading system. Evaluations of efficacy of TSD screening programs design and execution, cost-benefit and cost-utility health economic evaluation, and population outcomes were undertaken. The results have been used to propose a model for universal AJ TSD preconception and antenatal screening for the primary care setting."

As biomarkers for categorising patients and monitoring the effectiveness of developing therapies are lacking for this group of disorders, we sought to develop methodology to quantify GM2 levels in more readily attainable patient samples such as plasma, leukocytes, and cultured skin fibroblasts. Following organic extraction, gangliosides were partitioned into the aqueous phase and isolated using C18 solid-phase extraction columns. Relative quantification of three species of GM2 was achieved using LC/ESI-MS/MS with d35GM1 18:1/18:0 as an internal standard. The assay was linear over the biological range, and all GM2 gangliosidosis patients were demarcated from controls by elevated GM2 in cultured skin fibroblast extracts. However, in leukocytes only some molecular species could be used for differentiation and in plasma only one was informative. A reduction in GM2 was easily detected in patient skin fibroblasts after a short treatment with media from normal cells enriched in secreted β-hexosaminidase. This method may show promise for measuring the effectiveness of experimental therapies for GM2 gangliosidosis by allowing quantification of a reduction in the primary storage burden."

To determine the frequency of leukodystrophies and the phenotypic spectrum patients with cryptic spasticity of the legs were screened for underlying neurometabolic abnormalities. Seventy-six index patients presenting with adult-onset lower limb spasticity of unknown cause consistent with autosomal recessive inheritance were included in this study. Screening included serum levels of very long chain fatty acids for X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy/adrenomyeloneuropathy and lysosomal enzyme activities in leukocytes for metachromatic leukodystrophy, GM1-gangliosidosis, Tay-Sachs, Sandhoff and Krabbe disease. If clinical evidence was indicative of other types of leukodystrophies, additional genetic testing was conducted. Clinical characterization included neurological and psychiatric features and magnetic resonance imaging. Basic screening detected one index patient with metachromatic leukodystrophy, two patients with Krabbe disease and four patients with adrenoleukodystrophy/adrenomyeloneuropathy. Additional genetic testing revealed one patient with vanishing white matter disease. These patients accounted for an overall share of 11% of leukodystrophies. One patient with Krabbe disease and three patients with adrenoleukodystrophy/adrenomyeloneuropathy presented with pure spasticity of the lower limbs, whilst one patient each with Krabbe disease, metachromatic leukodystrophy and adrenoleukodystrophy/adrenomyeloneuropathy showed additional complicating symptoms. Adult patients presenting with cryptic spasticity of the legs should be screened for underlying X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy/adrenomyeloneuropathy and lysosomal disorders, irrespective of the presence of additional complicating symptoms. Leukodystrophies may manifest as late as the sixth decade and hyperintensity of cerebral white matter on magnetic resonance FLAIR images is not obligatory."

Clinical and electrophysiological data from 3 patients with Tay-Sachs disease were retrospectively collected. The augmented startle reflex appeared between the age of 3 and 17 months and disappeared between the age of 4 and 6 years. Analysis of brainstem auditory evoked potentials revealed that poor segregation of peak I, but not peak III, coincided with the disappearance of the augmented startle reflex. A blink reflex with markedly high amplitude was observed in a patient with an augmented startle reflex. The correlation between the augmented startle reflex and the preservation of peak I but not peak III supports the theory that the superior olivary nucleus is dispensable for this reflex. The blink reflex with high amplitudes may represent augmented excitability of reticular formation at the pontine tegmentum in Tay-Sachs disease, where the pattern generators for the augmented startle and blink reflexes may functionally overlap."

We compared DNA analysis by next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS) plus an assay for the 7.6 kb deletion to enzyme analysis for TSD carrier screening using 74 samples collected from participants at a TSD family conference. Fifty-one of 74 participants had positive enzyme results (46 carriers, five late-onset Tay-Sachs [LOTS]), 16 had negative, and seven had inconclusive results. NGS + 7.6 kb del screening of HEXA found a pathogenic mutation, pseudoallele, or variant of unknown significance (VUS) in 100% of the enzyme-positive or obligate carrier/enzyme-inconclusive samples. NGS detected the B1 allele in two enzyme-negative obligate carriers. Our data indicate that NGS can be used as a TSD clinical carrier screening tool. We demonstrate that NGS can be superior in detecting TSD carriers compared to traditional enzyme and genotyping methodologies, which are limited by false-positive and false-negative results and ethnically focused, limited mutation panels, respectively, but is not ready for sole use due to lack of information regarding some VUS."

Previous reports have shown a high occurrence of Sandhoff disease in northern Saskatchewan. Newborn screening cards from northern Saskatchewan were retrospectively screened in order to investigate the incidence and determine the carrier frequency of Sandhoff disease in these communities. PCR-based screening was conducted for the c.115delG (p.(Val39fs)) variant in the HEXB gene that was previously found in 4 Sandhoff disease patients from this area. The carrier frequency for this allele was estimated to be ~1:27. MS/MS-based screening of hexosaminidase activity along with genetic sequencing allowed for the identification of additional variants based on low total hexosaminidase activity and high % hexosaminidase A activity relative to c.115delG carriers. In total 4 pathogenic variants were discovered in the population (c.115delG, c.619A>G, c.1601G>T, and c.1652G>A) of which two are previously unreported (c.1601G>T and c.1652G>A). The combined carrier frequency of these alleles in the study area was estimated at ~1:15. Based on the number of cases of Sandhoff disease from this area we estimate the incidence to be ~1:390 corresponding to a child being born with the disease every 1-2 years on average. The results from our study were then compared with variants in the HEXB gene from the genomes available from the 1000 Genomes project. A total of 19 HEXB variants were found in the 1092 genomes of which 5 are suspected of having a deleterious effect on hexosaminidase activity. The estimated carrier frequency of Sandhoff disease in Saskatchewan at 1:15 is more than 3 times higher than the carrier frequency in the global sample provided by the 1000 Genomes project at 1:57."

    "abstract": "Traditional carrier screening assays are designed to look for only the most common mutations within a gene owing to cost considerations. Although this can yield high detection rates in specific populations for specific genes (such as cystic fibrosis in Caucasians), they are suboptimal for other ethnicities or for patients of mixed or unknown ethnic background. Next-generation DNA sequencing provides an opportunity to provide carrier screening using more comprehensive mutation panels that are limited primarily by information about the clinical impact of detected sequence changes. We describe a next-generation DNA sequencing-based assay capable of reliably screening patient samples in a timely and comprehensive manner. The analytic accuracy in a research setting has been documented. Here, we describe the additional studies performed to ensure the accuracy (analytic validity) and robustness of our assay for use in clinical practice and provide data from our experience offering this testing. Our clinical experience using this approach to screen 11,691 in vitro fertilization patients has identified 449 mutant alleles: 447 in carriers and 2 in an affected individual. In total, we found 87 distinct mutations in 14 different genes. Approximately one quarter of the mutations found are not included in traditional, limited, mutation panels, including 16 known mutations unique to our panel, and novel truncating mutations in several genes."

Histopathological examination of the nervous system identified extensive neuronal cytoplasmic accumulation of material that stained with periodic acid--Schiff and Luxol fast blue. Electron microscopy identified membranous cytoplasmic bodies within the nervous system. Serum biochemistry detected a marked decrease in hexosaminidase A activity in the one lamb tested, when compared with the concentration in age matched controls and genetic analysis identified a mutation in the sheep hexa allele G444R consistent with Tay-Sachs disease in Jacob sheep in North America. The identification of Tay-Sachs disease in British Jacob sheep supports previous evidence that the mutation in North American Jacob sheep originated from imported UK stock."

The first services involved chromosome studies, and these developed into genetic counselling services. Prenatal diagnosis began to be offered, particularly for older women at risk for chromosome abnormalities in the fetus, and those at risk for neural tube defects. Genetic screening was then initiated for the Jewish community because of their high carrier rate for Tay-Sachs disease. Educational courses in human genetics were offered at Wits Medical School, and medical as well as other health professionals began to be trained. Research, supported by national and international bodies, was integral in the activities of the Department (now Division) of Human Genetics and focused on genetic conditions affecting the generally understudied black community. In the late 1980s the first training programme for genetic counsellors was started at MSc level, and postgraduate scientists at MSc and PhD levels studied in and qualified through the Department. At the same time molecular genetic laboratories were set up. In the late 1990s training for medical geneticists was initiated. Extensive high-quality genetic services developed over the four decades were comparable to those of most other departments in developed countries."

    "abstract": "The GM2 gangliosidoses are progressive neurodegenerative disorders due to defects in the lysosomal β-N-acetylhexosaminidase system. Accumulation of β-hexosaminidases A and B substrates is presumed to cause this fatal condition. An authentic mouse model of Sandhoff disease (SD) with pathological characteristics resembling those noted in infantile GM2 gangliosidosis has been described. We have shown that expression of β-hexosaminidase by intracranial delivery of recombinant adeno-associated viral vectors to young adult SD mice can prevent many features of the disease and extends lifespan. To investigate the nature of the neurological injury in GM2 gangliosidosis and the extent of its reversibility, we have examined the evolution of disease in the SD mouse; we have moreover explored the effects of gene transfer delivered at key times during the course of the illness. Here we report greatly increased survival only when the therapeutic genes are expressed either before the disease is apparent or during its early manifestations. However, irrespective of when treatment was administered, widespread and abundant expression of β-hexosaminidase with consequent clearance of glycoconjugates, α-synuclein and ubiquitinated proteins, and abrogation of inflammatory responses and neuronal loss was observed. We also show that defects in myelination occur in early life and cannot be easily resolved when treatment is given to the adult brain. These results indicate that there is a limited temporal opportunity in which function and survival can be improved-but regardless of resolution of the cardinal pathological features of GM2 gangliosidosis, a point is reached when functional deterioration and death cannot be prevented."

A questionnaire was used for data collection and consisted of validated scales and purposively designed questions. Questionnaires were sent to all carriers and two non-carriers for each carrier who were screened in the program between 1999 and 2005. Twenty-four out of 69 (34.8 %) carriers and 30/138 (21.7 %) non-carriers completed the questionnaire. Most participants (82 %) retained good knowledge of TSD and there was no evidence of a difference in knowledge between carriers and non-carriers. Most participants (83 %) were happy with the timing and setting of screening and thought that education and screening for TSD should be offered during high school. There was no difference between carriers and non-carriers in mean scores for the State Trait Anxiety Inventory and Decision Regret Scale. This evaluation indicated that 5-11 years post high school screening, those who were screened are supportive of the program and that negative consequences are rare."

This study aimed to know the prevalence of different LSDs, their geographical variation, and burden on the society. It included 1,110 children from January 2002 to December 2012, having coarse facial features, hepatomegaly or hepatosplenomegaly, skeletal dysplasia, neuroregression, leukodystrophy, developmental delay, cerebral-cerebellar atrophy, and abnormal ophthalmic findings. All subjects were screened for I-cell disease, glycolipid storage disorders (Niemann-Pick disease A/B, Gaucher), and mucopolysaccharide disorders followed by confirmatory lysosomal enzymes study from leucocytes and/or fibroblasts. Niemann-Pick disease-C (NPC) was confirmed by fibroblasts study using filipin stain. Various storage disorders were detected in 387 children (34.8 %) with highest prevalence of glycolipid storage disorders in 48 %, followed by mucopolysaccharide disorders in 22 % and defective sulfatide degradation in 14 % of the children. Less common defects were glycogen degradation defect and protein degradation defect in 5 % each, lysosomal trafficking protein defect in 4 %, and transport defect in 3 % of the patients. This study demonstrates higher incidence of Gaucher disease (16 %) followed by GM2 gangliosidosis that includes Tay-Sachs disease (10 %) and Sandhoff disease (7.8 %) and mucopolysaccharide disorders among all LSDs. Nearly 30 % of the affected children were born to consanguineous parents and this was higher (72 %) in children with Batten disease. Our study also demonstrates two common mutations c.1277_1278insTATC in 14.28 % (4/28) and c.964G>T (p.D322Y) in 10.7 % (3/28) for Tay-Sachs disease in addition to the earlier reported c.1385A>T (p.E462V) mutation in 21.42 % (6/28)."

Glycolipids are endocytosed and targeted to the Golgi apparatus in normal cells but in Gaucher disease they are mistargeted to lysosomes. To better understand the role of GlcCer in endocytic sorting RAW macrophages were treated with Conduritol B-epoxide to inhibit GlcCer breakdown. Lipid analysis found increases in GlcCer led to accumulation of both triacylglycerol and cholesterol consistent with increased lysosomal pH. Ratio imaging of macrophages using both acridine orange and lysosensor yellow/blue to measure endolysosomal pH revealed increases in Conduritol B-epoxide treated RAW macrophages and Gaucher patient lymphoblasts. Increased endolysosomal pH was restricted to Gaucher lymphoblasts as no significant increases in pH were seen in Fabry, Krabbe, Tay-Sachs and GM1-gangliosidosis lymphoblasts. Substrate reduction therapy utilises inhibitors of GlcCer synthase to reduce storage in Gaucher disease. The addition of inhibitors of GlcCer synthesis to RAW macrophages also led to increases in cholesterol and triacylglycerol and an endolysosomal pH increase of up to 1 pH unit. GlcCer modulation appears specific since glucosylsphingosine but not galactosylsphingosine reversed the effects of GlcCer depletion. Although no acute effects on glycolipid trafficking were observed using bafilomycin A the results are consistent with a multistep model whereby increases in pH lead to altered trafficking via cholesterol accumulation. GlcCer modulates endolysosomal pH in lymphocytes suggesting an important role in normal lysosomes which may be disrupted in Gaucher disease."

GM1 and GM2 gangliosidosis are associated with deficiency of β-galactosidase and β-hexosaminidase respectively. All gangliosidoses are characterized by progressive neurodegeneration, the severity of which is proportional to the residual enzyme activity. The GM1 gangliosidoses are characterized by dysostosis, organomegaly and coarsening in their most severe forms, whereas children with classic infantile GM2 gangliosidosis (Tay-Sachs disease) are usually spared systemic involvement, except in the case of the Sandhoff variant, in which organomegaly may occur. Cherry-red macular spots occur in the early onset forms of the gangliosidoses, but are less frequently seen in the less severe, later onset phenotypes. Macrocephaly, an exaggerated startle response, cognitive decline, seizures, ataxia, and progressive muscular atrophy may occur in different forms of gangliosidosis. The diagnosis is made by assay of enzyme activity, and can be confirmed by mutation analysis. Carrier screening for Tay-Sachs disease has been remarkably successful in reducing the incidence of this disease in the at-risk Ashkenazi population. There are no proven disease-modifying therapies for the gangliosidoses."

Eight AJ founder mutations in the HEXA, SMPD1, and MCOLN1 genes were analyzed. The frequencies of these mutations were compared to AJ control groups that included large published groups undergoing prenatal screening and 282 individuals matched for age and sex. Mutation frequencies were similar in the 2 groups of patients with PD. The SMPD1 p.L302P was strongly associated with a highly increased risk for PD (odds ratio 9.4, 95% confidence interval 3.9-22.8, p < 0.0001), as 9/938 patients with PD were carriers of this mutation compared to only 11/10,709 controls. The SMPD1 p.L302P mutation is a novel risk factor for PD. Although it is rare on a population level, the identification of this mutation as a strong risk factor for PD may further elucidate PD pathogenesis and the role of lysosomal pathways in disease development."

    "abstract": "The hydrolysis in lysosomes of GM2 ganglioside to GM3 ganglioside requires the correct synthesis, intracellular assembly and transport of three separate gene products; i.e., the alpha and beta subunits of heterodimeric beta-hexosaminidase A, E.C. # 3.2.1.52 (encoded by the HEXA and HEXB genes, respectively), and the GM2-activator protein (GM2AP, encoded by the GM2A gene). Mutations in any one of these genes can result in one of three neurodegenerative diseases collectively known as GM2 gangliosidosis (HEXA, Tay-Sachs disease, MIM # 272800; HEXB, Sandhoff disease, MIM # 268800; and GM2A, AB-variant form, MIM # 272750). Elements of both of the hexosaminidase A subunits are needed to productively interact with the GM2 ganglioside-GM2AP complex in the lysosome. Some of these elements have been predicted from the crystal structures of hexosaminidase and the activator. Recently a hybrid of the two subunits has been constructed and reported to be capable of forming homodimers that can perform this reaction in vivo, which could greatly simplify vector-mediated gene transfer approaches for Tay-Sachs or Sandhoff diseases. A cDNA encoding a hybrid hexosaminidase subunit capable of dimerizing and hydrolyzing GM2 ganglioside could be incorporated into a single vector, whereas packaging both subunits of hexosaminidase A into vectors, such as adeno-associated virus, would be impractical due to size constraints. In this report we examine the previously published hybrid construct (H1) and a new more extensive hybrid (H2), with our documented in cellulo (live cell- based) assay utilizing a fluorescent GM2 ganglioside derivative. Unfortunately when Tay-Sachs cells were transfected with either the H1 or H2 hybrid construct and then were fed the GM2 derivative, no significant increase in its turnover was detected. In vitro assays with the isolated H1 or H2 homodimers confirmed that neither was capable of human GM2AP-dependent hydrolysis of GM2 ganglioside."

    "abstract": "Biochemical testing of hexosaminidase A (HexA) enzyme activity has been available for decades and has the ability to detect almost all Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) carriers, irrespective of ethnic background. This is increasingly important, as the gene pool of those who identify as Ashkenazi Jewish is diversifying. Here we describe the analysis of a cohort of 4,325 individuals arising from large carrier screening programs and tested by the serum and/or platelet HexA enzyme assays and by targeted DNA mutation analysis. Our results continue to support the platelet assay as a highly effective method for TSD carrier screening, with a low inconclusive rate and the ability to detect possible disease-causing mutation carriers that would have been missed by targeted DNA mutation analysis. Sequence analysis performed on one such platelet assay carrier, who had one non-Ashkenazi Jewish parent, identified the amino acid change Thr259Ala (A775G). Based on crystallographic modeling, this change is predicted to be deleterious, as threonine 259 is positioned proximal to the HexA alpha subunit active site and helps to stabilize key residues therein. Accordingly, if individuals are screened for TSD in broad-based programs by targeted molecular testing alone, they must be made aware that there is a more sensitive and inexpensive test available that can identify additional carriers. Alternatively, the enzyme assays can be offered as a first tier test, especially when screening individuals of mixed or non-Jewish ancestry."

    "abstract": "Loss-of-function diseases are often caused by destabilizing mutations that lead to protein misfolding and degradation. Modulating the innate protein homeostasis (proteostasis) capacity may lead to rescue of native folding of the mutated variants, thereby ameliorating the disease phenotype. In lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs), a number of highly prevalent alleles have missense mutations that do not impair the enzyme's catalytic activity but destabilize its native structure, resulting in the degradation of the misfolded protein. Enhancing the cellular folding capacity enables rescuing the native, biologically functional structure of these unstable mutated enzymes. However, proteostasis modulators specific for the lysosomal system are currently unknown. Here, we investigate the role of the transcription factor EB (TFEB), a master regulator of lysosomal biogenesis and function, in modulating lysosomal proteostasis in LSDs. We show that TFEB activation results in enhanced folding, trafficking and lysosomal activity of a severely destabilized glucocerebrosidase (GC) variant associated with the development of Gaucher disease (GD), the most common LSD. TFEB specifically induces the expression of GC and of key genes involved in folding and lysosomal trafficking, thereby enhancing both the pool of mutated enzyme and its processing through the secretory pathway. TFEB activation also rescues the activity of a β-hexosaminidase mutant associated with the development of another LSD, Tay-Sachs disease, thus suggesting general applicability of TFEB-mediated proteostasis modulation to rescue destabilizing mutations in LSDs. In summary, our findings identify TFEB as a specific regulator of lysosomal proteostasis and suggest that TFEB may be used as a therapeutic target to rescue enzyme homeostasis in LSDs."

In Tay-Sachs disease, excessive accumulation of GM2 ganglioside (GM2), mainly in the central nervous system, is caused by a deficiency of the HexA isozyme (αβ heterodimer), resulting in progressive neurologic disorders. In Sandhoff disease, combined deficiencies of HexA and HexB (ββ homodimer) cause not only the accumulation of GM2 but also of oligosaccharides carrying terminal N-acetylhexosamine residues (GlcNAc-oligosaccharides), resulting in systemic manifestations including hepatosplenomegaly as well as neurologic symptoms. Hence there is little clinically effective treatment for these GM2 gangliosidoses. Recent studies on the molecular pathogenesis in Sandhoff disease patients and disease model mice have shown the involvement of microglial activation and chemokine induction in neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in this disease. Experimental and therapeutic approaches, including recombinant enzyme replacement, have been performed using Sandhoff disease model mice, suggesting the future application of novel techniques to treat GM2 gangliosidoses (Hex deficiencies), including Sandhoff disease as well as Tay-Sachs disease. In this study, we isolated astrocytes and microglia from the neonatal brain of Sandhoff disease model mice and demonstrated abnormalities of glial cells. Moreover, we demonstrated the therapeutic effect of an intracerebroventricular administration of novel recombinant human HexA carrying a high content of M6P residue in Sandhoff disease model mice."

For each disease, we developed a family-specific fluorescent multiplex single-cell PCR protocol that included the familial mutation and informative markers surrounding the mutation. Embryo biopsy and PGD analysis were performed on either oocytes (polar bodies one and two) or on single blastomeres from a six-cell embryo. We treated twenty families carrying mutations in these lysosomal storage disorders, including 3 couples requiring simultaneous analysis for two disorders (TSD/GD, TSD/balanced Robertsonian translocation 45XYder(21;14), and HS/oculocutaneus albinism). These analyses led to an overall pregnancy rate/embryo transfer of 38% and the birth of 20 unaffected children from 17 families. We have found that PGD for lysosomal disorders is a safe and effective method to prevent birth of affected children.

    "abstract": "GM2 gangliosidosis is a fatal lysosomal storage disease caused by a deficiency of β-hexosaminidase (EC 3.2.1.52). There are two major isoforms of the enzyme: hexosaminidase A composed of an α and a β subunit (encoded by HEXA and HEXB genes, respectively); and, hexosaminidase B composed of two β subunits. Hexosaminidase A requires an activator protein encoded by GM2A to catabolize GM2 ganglioside, but even in the absence of the activator protein, it can hydrolyze the synthetic substrates commonly used to assess enzyme activity. GM2 gangliosidosis has been reported in Japanese Chin dogs, and we identified the disease in two related Japanese Chin dogs based on clinical signs, histopathology and elevated brain GM2 gangliosides. As in previous reports, we found normal or elevated hexosaminidase activity when measured with the synthetic substrates. This suggested that the canine disease is analogous to human AB variant of G(M2) gangliosidosis, which results from mutations in GM2A. However, only common neutral single nucleotide polymorphisms were found upon sequence analysis of the canine ortholog of GM2A from the affected Japanese Chins. When the same DNA samples were used to sequence HEXA, we identified a homozygous HEXA:c967G>A transition which predicts a p.E323K substitution. The glutamyl moiety at 323 is known to make an essential contribution to the active site of hexosaminidase A, and none of the 128 normal Japanese Chins and 92 normal dogs of other breeds that we tested was homozygous for HEXA:c967A. Thus it appears that the HEXA:c967G>A transition is responsible for the GM2 gangliosidosis in Japanese Chins."

Deficiency in function of either the NPC1 or NPC2 protein in NPC disease or lysosomal acid lipase in Wolman disease results in defective cellular cholesterol trafficking. Lysosomal accumulation of cholesterol and enlarged lysosomes are shared phenotypic characteristics of both NPC and Wolman cells. Utilizing a phenotypic screen of an approved drug collection, we found that δ-tocopherol effectively reduced lysosomal cholesterol accumulation, decreased lysosomal volume, increased cholesterol efflux, and alleviated pathological phenotypes in both NPC1 and Wolman fibroblasts. Reduction of these abnormalities may be mediated by a δ-tocopherol-induced intracellular Ca(2+) response and subsequent enhancement of lysosomal exocytosis. Consistent with a general mechanism for reduction of lysosomal lipid accumulation, we also found that δ-tocopherol reduces pathological phenotypes in patient fibroblasts from other lysosomal storage diseases, including NPC2, Batten (ceroid lipofuscinosis, neuronal 2, CLN2), Fabry, Farber, Niemann-Pick disease type A, Sanfilippo type B (mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIB, MPSIIIB), and Tay-Sachs.

The molecular events that lead to irreversible neuronal injury accompanied by gliosis are unknown; but gene transfer, when undertaken before neurological signs are manifest, effectively rescues the acute neurodegenerative illness in Hexb-/- (Sandhoff) mice that lack β-hexosaminidases A and B. To define determinants of therapeutic efficacy and establish a dynamic experimental platform to systematically investigate cellular pathogenesis of GM2 gangliosidosis, we generated two inducible experimental models. Reversible transgenic expression of β-hexosaminidase directed by two promoters, mouse Hexb and human Synapsin 1 promoters, permitted progression of GM2 gangliosidosis in Sandhoff mice to be modified at pre-defined ages. A single auto-regulatory tetracycline-sensitive expression cassette controlled expression of transgenic Hexb in the brain of Hexb-/- mice and provided long-term rescue from the acute neuronopathic disorder, as well as the accompanying pathological storage of glycoconjugates and gliosis in most parts of the brain. Ultimately, late-onset brainstem and ventral spinal cord pathology occurred and was associated with increased tone in the limbs. Silencing transgenic Hexb expression in five-week-old mice induced stereotypic signs and progression of Sandhoff disease, including tremor, bradykinesia, and hind-limb paralysis. As in germline Hexb-/- mice, these neurodegenerative manifestations advanced rapidly, indicating that the pathogenesis and progression of GM2 gangliosidosis is not influenced by developmental events in the maturing nervous system."

    "abstract": "Multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification (MLPA) assays were designed for the genes HEXB (OMIM: 606873), GM2A (OMIM: 613109) and SMARCAL1 (OMIM: 606622) of humans. Two sets of synthetic MLPA probes for these coding exons were tested. Changes in copy numbers were detected as well as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) by complementary DNA sequence analyses. The MLPA method was shown to be reliable for mutation detection and identified five published and 12 new mutations. In all cases from a Morbus Sandhoff cohort of patients, exclusively one variation in copy number was observed and linked to a nucleotide alteration called c.1614-14C>A. This deletion comprised exons 1-5. One of these cases is described in detail. Deletions were neither detected in the GM2A nor the SMARCAL1 genes. The MLPA assays complement routine diagnostics for M. Sandhoff (OMIM: 268800), M. Tay-Sachs variant AB (OMIM: 272750) and Schimke immuno-osseous dysplasia (OMIM: 242900)."

    "abstract": "Mutations of the glycogen branching enzyme gene, GBE1, result in glycogen storage disease (GSD) type IV, an autosomal recessive disorder having multiple clinical forms. One mutant allele of this gene, GBE1 c.1076A>C, has been reported in Ashkenazi Jewish cases of an adult-onset form of GSD type IV, adult polyglucosan body disease (APBD), but no epidemiological analyses of this mutation have been performed. We report here the first epidemiological study of this mutation in persons of Ashkenazi Jewish background and find that this mutation has a gene frequency of 1 in 34.5 (95% CI: 0.0145-0.0512), similar to the frequency of the common mutation causing Tay-Sachs disease among Ashkenazi Jews. This finding reveals APBD to be another monogenic disorder that occurs with increased frequency in persons of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry."

    "abstract": "Of 7,028 disorders with suspected Mendelian inheritance, 1,139 are recessive and have an established molecular basis. Although individually uncommon, Mendelian diseases collectively account for ~20% of infant mortality and ~18% of pediatric hospitalizations. Molecular diagnostic testing is currently available for only ~300 recessive disorders. Preconception screening, together with genetic counseling of carriers, has resulted in remarkable declines in the incidence of several severe recessive diseases including Tay-Sachs disease and cystic fibrosis. However, extension of preconception screening and molecular diagnostic testing to most recessive disease genes has hitherto been impractical. Recently, we reported a preconception carrier screen / molecular diagnostic test for 448 recessive childhood diseases. The current status of this test is reviewed here. Currently, this reports analytical validity of the comprehensive carrier test. As the clinical validity and clinical utility in the contexts described is ascertained, this article will be updated."

    "abstract": "Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative disorders currently associated with 27 genes. The most frequent types are caused by expansions in coding CAG repeats. The frequency of SCA subtypes varies among populations. We examined the occurrence of rare SCAs, SCA8, SCA12, SCA17 and dentatorubro-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA), in the Czech population from where the data were missing. We analyzed causal gene expansions in 515 familial and sporadic ataxic patients negatively tested for SCA1-3 and SCA6-7. Pathogenic SCA8 and SCA17 expansions were identified in eight and five patients, respectively. Tay-Sachs disease was later diagnosed in one patient with an SCA8 expansion and the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS) was suspected in two other patients with SCA8 expansions. These findings are probably coincidental, although the participation of SCA8 expansions in the susceptibility to MS and disease progression cannot be fully excluded. None of the patients had pathogenic SCA12 or DRPLA expansions. However, three patients had intermediate SCA12 alleles out of the normal range with 36 and 43 CAGs. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) was probable in the patient with 43 CAGs. This coincidence is remarkable, especially in the context with the recently identified predisposing role of longer SCA2 alleles in ALS. Five families with SCA17 represent a significant portion of ataxic patients and this should be reflected in the diagnostics of SCAs in the Czech population. SCA8 expansions must be considered after careful clinical evaluation."

To elucidate the clinical, biochemical and mutation spectrum and to study the management options in Indian patients with lysosomal storage disorders. Descriptive study. All patients with lysosomal storage disorders diagnosed in the Medical Genetics department of a tertiary care institute in North India over a three year period from January 2008 to December 2010. Out of the total of 93 patients clinically suspected to have LSDs, 68 (mean age at presentation 4.5 years) were confirmed to have LSDs based on the laboratory/neuroimaging findings and documentation of deficient enzymatic activity in the peripheral blood (leucocytes or plasma) and/or skin fibroblasts. The commonest clinical features at presentation were growth retardation (failure to thrive 47.2% and short stature 17.6%), hepatosplenomegaly (41.2%) and neuroregression (33.8%). A history of consanguinity was present in 32.4% of the families. Prenatal diagnosis was done in a total of 6 affected families; two pregnancies were found to be affected (one each with Gaucher disease and Tay Sachs disease) and in both cases the parents opted for termination of pregnancy. Of the remaining four pregnancies which were found to be unaffected and therefore continued, three were confirmed to be normal on post-natal follow up. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is being given for a total of 8 LSD patients and all of them are showing a gradual amelioration of their symptoms and an improvement in the quality of life. Lysosomal storage disorders constitute an important group of genetic metabolic disorders for many of which therapeutic options are now available."

    "abstract": "The GM2 gangliosidoses are autosomal recessive lysosomal storage diseases caused by a deficiency of the β-hexosaminidase A enzyme. This enzyme is composed of two polypeptide chains designated the α- and β- subunits and it interacts with the GM2 activator protein. The HEXA and HEXB genes encode the α-subunit and the β-subunit, respectively. Mutations in these genes are causative of Tay-Sachs disease (HEXA) and Sandhoff disease (HEXB). We analyzed the complete HEXA gene in 34 Spanish patients with Tay-Sachs disease and the HEXB gene in 14 Spanish patients with Sandhoff disease. We identified 27 different mutations, 14 of which were novel, in the HEXA gene and 14 different mutations, 8 of which unreported until now, in the HEXB gene, and we attempted to correlate these mutations with the clinical presentation of the patients. We found a high frequency of c.459+5G>A (IVS4+5G>A) mutation in HEXA affected patients, 22 of 68 alleles, which represent the 32.4%. This is the highest percentage found of this mutation in a population. All patients homozygous for mutation c.459+5G>A presented with the infantile form of the disease and, as previously reported, patients carrying mutation p.R178H in at least one of the alleles presented with a milder form. In HEXB affected patients, the novel deletion c.171delG accounts for 21.4% of the mutant alleles (6/28). All patients with this deletion showed the infantile form of the disease. The Spanish GM2 gangliosidoses affected patients show a great mutational heterogeneity as seen in other inherited lisosomal diseases in this country."

    "abstract": "Tay Sachs disease (TSD) is a neurodegenerative disorder due to β-hexosaminidase A deficiency caused by mutations in the HEXA gene. The mutations leading to Tay Sachs disease in India are yet unknown. We aimed to determine mutations leading to TSD in India by complete sequencing of the HEXA gene. The clinical inclusion criteria included neuroregression, seizures, exaggerated startle reflex, macrocephaly, cherry red spot on fundus examination and spasticity. Neuroimaging criteria included thalamic hyperdensities on CT scan/T1W images of MRI of the brain. Biochemical criteria included deficiency of hexosaminidase A (less than 2% of total hexosaminidase activity for infantile patients). Total leukocyte hexosaminidase activity was assayed by 4-methylumbelliferyl-N-acetyl-β-D-glucosamine lysis and hexosaminidase A activity was assayed by heat inactivation method and 4-methylumbelliferyl-N-acetyl-β-D-glucosamine-6-sulphate lysis method. The exons and exon-intron boundaries of the HEXA gene were bidirectionally sequenced using an automated sequencer. Mutations were confirmed in parents and looked up in public databases. In silico analysis for mutations was carried out using SIFT, Polyphen2, MutationT@ster and Accelrys Discovery Studio softwares. Fifteen families were included in the study. We identified six novel missense mutations, c.340 G>A (p.E114K), c.964 G>A (p.D322N), c.964 G>T (p.D322Y), c.1178C>G (p.R393P) and c.1385A>T (p.E462V), c.1432 G>A (p.G478R) and two previously reported mutations. c.1277_1278insTATC and c.508C>T (p.R170W). The mutation p.E462V was found in six unrelated families from Gujarat indicating a founder effect. A previously known splice site mutation c.805+1 G>C and another intronic mutation c.672+30 T>G of unknown significance were also identified. Mutations could not be identified in one family. We conclude that TSD patients from Gujarat should be screened for the common mutation p.E462V."

    "abstract": "Tay-Sachs disease, also known as GM2 gangliosidosis or Hexosaminidase A deficiency is an autosomal recessive genetic fatal disorder. The disease is known to appear in East European Ashkenazi Jews, North African Jews, and Quebec French Canadians exclusively, but, with different frequency and type of mutation. Its most common variant is the infantile type Tay-Sachs disease. Juvenile and late-onset forms of the disease are infrequent and slowly progressive. At nearly 3 to 6 months old, a baby with Tay-Sachs progressively loses his motor skills and attentiveness. Startle responses and hyperreflexia become prominent, especially on eliciting deep patellar and Achilles reflexes, as a consequence of neurodegeneration of the upper motor neuron. Other systemic damage ensues gradually; seizures, blindness, spasticity of limbs, inability to swallow and breathe, and eventually the baby dies at 1-4 years of age. All Tay-Sachs patients have a \"cherry red spot\", easily seen in the macula area of the retina, using an ophthalmoscope. The \"cherry red spot\" is the only normal part of the retina in these sick babies. The case presented here emphasizes that Tay-Sachs disease is sometimes misdiagnosed at first visits even by an experienced clinician, because of his lack of awareness that this disease is not exclusively a Jewish disease."

Retrospective observational study using EMR data of all 10,715 patients who received genetic testing by physicians trained in a primary care specialty or subspecialty at an academic medical center between January 1, 2008 and December 31, 2010. Patients had a mean±SD age of 38.3±15.8 years (median 36.1, IQR 30.0-43.8). The proportion of female subjects in the study population was larger than in the general patient population (77.2% vs 55.0%, p<0.001) and they were younger than the male subjects in the study (36.5±13.2 vs 44.6±21.2 years, p<0.001). Approximately 1.1% of all patients received genetic testing. There were 942 physicians who ordered a total of 15,320 genetic tests. By volume, commonly tested genes involved mutations for cystic fibrosis (36.7%), prothrombin (13.7%), Tay-Sachs disease (6.7%), hereditary hemochromatosis (4.4%), and chronic myelogenous leukemia (4.1%). EMRs stored reports as free text with categorical descriptions of mutations and an average length of 269.4±153.2 words (median 242, IQR 146-401). In this study, genetic tests were often ordered by a diverse group of physicians for women of childbearing age being evaluated for diseases that may affect potential offspring. EMRs currently serve primarily as a storage warehouse for textual reports that could potentially be transformed into meaningful structured data for next-generation clinical decision support. Further studies are needed to address the design, development, and implementation of EMRs capable of managing the critical genetic health information challenges of the future."

    "abstract": "Alterations in the lipid composition of endosomal-lysosomal membranes may constitute an early event in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. In this study, we investigated the possibility that GM2 ganglioside accumulation in a mouse model of Sandhoff disease might be associated with the accumulation of intraneuronal and extracellular proteins commonly observed in AD. Our results show intraneuronal accumulation of amyloid-β peptide (Aβ)-like, α-synuclein-like, and phospho-tau-like immunoreactivity in the brains of β-hexosaminidase knock-out (HEXB KO) mice. Biochemical and immunohistochemical analyses confirmed that at least some of the intraneuronal Aβ-like immunoreactivity (iAβ-LIR) represents amyloid precursor protein C-terminal fragments (APP-CTFs) and/or Aβ. In addition, we observed increased levels of Aβ40 and Aβ42 peptides in the lipid-associated fraction of HEXB KO mouse brains, and intraneuronal accumulation of ganglioside-bound Aβ (GAβ) immunoreactivity in a brain region-specific manner. Furthermore, α-synuclein and APP-CTFs and/or Aβ were found to accumulate in different regions of the substantia nigra, indicating different mechanisms of accumulation or turnover pathways. Based on the localization of the accumulated iAβ-LIR to endosomes, lysosomes, and autophagosomes, we conclude that a significant accumulation of iAβ-LIR may be associated with the lysosomal-autophagic turnover of Aβ and fragments of APP-containing Aβ epitopes. Importantly, intraneuronal GAβ immunoreactivity, a proposed prefibrillar aggregate found in AD, was found to accumulate throughout the frontal cortices of postmortem human GM1 gangliosidosis, Sandhoff disease, and Tay-Sachs disease brains. Together, these results establish an association between the accumulation of gangliosides, autophagic vacuoles, and the intraneuronal accumulation of proteins associated with AD."

    "abstract": "The GM2 gangliosidoses are fatal lysosomal storage diseases principally affecting the brain. Absence of β-hexosaminidase A and B activities in the Sandhoff mouse causes neurological dysfunction and recapitulates the acute Tay-Sachs (TSD) and Sandhoff diseases (SD) in infants. Intracranial coinjection of recombinant adeno-associated viral vectors (rAAV), serotype 2/1, expressing human β-hexosaminidase α (HEXA) and β (HEXB) subunits into 1-month-old Sandhoff mice gave unprecedented survival to 2 years and prevented disease throughout the brain and spinal cord. Classical manifestations of disease, including spasticity-as opposed to tremor-ataxia-were resolved by localized gene transfer to the striatum or cerebellum, respectively. Abundant biosynthesis of β-hexosaminidase isozymes and their global distribution via axonal, perivascular, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) spaces, as well as diffusion, account for the sustained phenotypic rescue-long-term protein expression by transduced brain parenchyma, choroid plexus epithelium, and dorsal root ganglia neurons supplies the corrective enzyme. Prolonged survival permitted expression of cryptic disease in organs not accessed by intracranial vector delivery. We contend that infusion of rAAV into CSF space and intraparenchymal administration by convection-enhanced delivery at a few strategic sites will optimally treat neurodegeneration in many diseases affecting the nervous system."

    "abstract": "Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) is a recessively inherited disorder caused by the deficient activity of hexosaminidase A due to mutations in the HEXA gene. Up to date there is no information regarding the molecular genetics of TSD in Argentinean patients. In the present study we have studied 17 Argentinean families affected by TSD, including 20 patients with the acute infantile form and 3 with the sub-acute form. Overall, we identified 14 different mutations accounting for 100% of the studied alleles. Eight mutations were novel: 5 were single base changes leading to drastic residue changes or truncated proteins, 2 were small deletions and one was an intronic mutation that may cause a splicing defect. Although the spectrum of mutations was highly heterogeneous, a high frequency of the c.459+5G>A mutation, previously described in different populations was found among the studied cohort. Haplotype analysis suggested that in these families the c.459+5G>A mutation might have arisen by a single mutational event."

The system was further developed and applied for the amplified detection of Tay-Sachs genetic disorder mutant, with a detection limit of 1.0 × 10(-11) M. Besides providing a versatile paradigm for the amplified detection of DNA, the system reveals a new, enzyme-free, isothermal, autocatalytic mechanism that introduces means for effective programmed synthesis."

The lyso-GM2 levels in the brain and plasma in Sandhoff mice were apparently increased compared with those in wild-type mice, and they decreased on intracerebroventricular administration of the modified Hex B. The lyso-GM2 levels in plasma of patients with Tay-Sachs disease and Sandhoff disease were increased, and the increase in lyso-GM2 was associated with a decrease in Hex A activity.

For those with a family history of an inherited condition, this ought to be a routine discussion; however, this can be expanded to include the wider population, especially for those conditions for which carrier frequencies are considered relatively common. There is published literature from around the world regarding experiences with carrier screening in primary care for cystic fibrosis, haemoglobinopathies, fragile X syndrome, Tay-Sachs disease and spinal muscular atrophy, although many of these have tended to focus on consultations during rather than before pregnancy.

Case notification is made via monthly surveillance card, administered by the British Paediatric Surveillance Unit to all UK-based paediatricians; children with GM2 gangliosidosis were identified from cases satisfying inclusion in the UK study of Progressive Intellectual and Neurological Deterioration and analysed according to phenotypic and biochemical categories. Between May 1997 and January 2010, 73 individuals with GM2 gangliosidoses were reported: 40 with Tay-Sachs disease, 31 with Sandhoff disease, and two with GM2 activator protein deficiency. Together they account for 6% (73/1164) of all diagnosed cases of progressive intellectual and neurological deterioration. The majority (62/73) were sporadic index cases with no family history. Children of Pakistani ancestry were overrepresented in all subtypes, particularly juvenile Sandhoff disease, accounting for 10 of 11 notified cases. Infantile-onset variants predominated (55/73); the mean age at onset of symptoms was 6.2 and 4.7 months for infantile-onset Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff disease respectively, and 26.2 and 34.7 months for the corresponding juvenile-onset variants. Time to diagnosis averaged 7.4 months and 28.0 months in infantile- and juvenile-onset disease respectively. GM2 gangliosidosis is a significant cause of childhood neurodegenerative disease; timely diagnosis relies upon improved clinical recognition, which may be increasingly important as specific therapies become available. There is a potential benefit from the introduction of screening programmes for high-risk ethnic groups."

By correlating the frequencies of mutant HEXA, MIM *606869 (gene map locus 15q23-q24) alleles with subjects' nominated ethnicity (Ashkenazi/Sephardi/Mixed) and grandparental birthplaces, we established that Ashkenazi ethnicity is a better predictor of TSD carrier status than grandparental ancestral origins. Screening self-identified Ashkenazi subjects detected 95% of TSD carriers (carrier frequency 1:25). Having mixed Ashkenazi and non-Ashkenazi heritage reduced the carrier frequency (1:97). South African heritage conveyed a fourfold risk of c.1421 + 1G > C mutation compared with other AJ subjects (odds ratio (OR), 4.19; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.83-9.62, p = 0.001), but this was the only specific case of ancestral origin improving diagnostic sensitivity over that based on determining Ashkenazi ethnicity. Carriers of c.1278insTATC mutations were more likely to have heritage from Western Europe (OR, 1.65 (95% CI, 1.04-2.60), p = 0.032) and South Eastern Europe (OR, 1.77 (95% CI, 1.14-2.73), p = 0.010).

    "abstract": "In April 2011, the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (formerly the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology [ACOG]), updated its policy on carrier screening for cystic fibrosis and proposed that because of the increasing difficulty in assigning a single ethnicity to individuals, \"It is reasonable, therefore to offer CF carrier screening to all patients.\" However, ACOG continues to use ethnicity in its guidelines about carrier testing for autosomal recessive disorders like sickle cell disease (SCD) and Tay-Sachs disease (TSD). This practice is in marked contrast with newborn screening (NBS) which is universally provided for all conditions. In this manuscript, I evaluate the discrepant role of ethnicity in NBS and carrier screening. I argue that ACOG needs to adopt the position it now takes for CF regarding prenatal carrier testing for all conditions. To promote equity in prenatal testing decision making, health care policies must acknowledge the diversity of the populations that we serve and empower all women and couples to make more fully informed reproductive decisions by offering prenatal carrier testing to all."

Onset during infancy leads to rapid neurodegeneration and death before 4 years of age. We set out to quantify the rate of functional decline in infantile G(M2) gangliosidosis on the basis of patient surveys and a comprehensive review of existing literature. Patients with infantile G(M2) gangliosidosis (N = 237) were surveyed via questionnaire by the National Tay Sachs & Allied Diseases Association (NTSAD). These data were supplemented by survival data from the NTSAD database and a literature survey. Detailed retrospective surveys from 97 patients were available. Five patients who had received hematopoietic stem cell transplantation were evaluated separately. The mortality rate of the remaining 92 patients was comparable to that of the 103 patients from the NTSAD database and 121 patients reported in the literature. Common symptoms at onset were developmental arrest (83%), startling (65%), and hypotonia (60%). All 55 patients who had learned to sit without support lost that ability within 1 year. Individual functional measures correlated with each other but not with survival. Gastric tube placement was associated with prolonged survival. Tay Sachs and Sandhoff variants did not differ. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation was not associated with prolonged survival. We studied the timing of regression in 97 cases of infantile G(M2) gangliosidosis and conclude that clinical disease progression does not correlate with survival, likely because of the impact of improved supportive care over time. However, functional measures are quantifiable and can inform power calculations and study design of future interventions."

    "abstract": "Lysosomal storage disorders are often caused by mutations that destabilize native folding and impair trafficking of secretory proteins. We demonstrate that endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation (ERAD) prevents native folding of mutated lysosomal enzymes in patient-derived fibroblasts from two clinically distinct lysosomal storage disorders, namely Gaucher and Tay-Sachs disease. Prolonging ER retention via ERAD inhibition enhanced folding, trafficking, and activity of these unstable enzyme variants. Furthermore, combining ERAD inhibition with enhancement of the cellular folding capacity via proteostasis modulation resulted in synergistic rescue of mutated enzymes. ERAD inhibition was achieved by cell treatment with small molecules that interfere with recognition (kifunensine) or retrotranslocation (eeyarestatin I) of misfolded substrates. These different mechanisms of ERAD inhibition were shown to enhance ER retention of mutated proteins but were associated with dramatically different levels of ER stress, unfolded protein response activation, and unfolded protein response-induced apoptosis."

Using the RNA interference approach, we generated an in vitro model of HEXs knock-down immunogenic DCs (i-DCs) from CD34(+)-haemopoietic stem cells (CD34(+)-HSCs), thus mimicking the Tay-Sachs (HEXA-/-) and Sandhoff (HEXB-/-) cells. We showed that the absence of β-N-acetyl-hexosaminidase activity does not alter the differentiation of i-DCs from HSCs, but it is critical for the activation of CD4(+)T cells because knock-down of HEXA or HEXB gene causes a loss of function of i-DCs. Notably, the silencing of the HEXA gene had a stronger immune inhibitory effect, thereby indicating a major involvement of β-N-acetyl-hexosaminidase A isoenzyme within this mechanism."

Prenatal/premarital carrier screening programs in the Ashkenazi Jewish community have markedly reduced disease occurrence. We report the first Jordanian Arab TSD patient diagnosed by deficient β-hexosaminidase A activity. HEXA mutation analysis revealed homozygosity for a nonsense mutation, c.78G>A (p.W26X). Previously reported in Arab patients, this mutation is a candidate for TSD screening in Arab populations."

    "abstract": "Saccade-generating burst neurons (BN) are inhibited by omnipause neurons (OPN), except during saccades. OPN activity pauses before saccade onset and resumes at the saccade end. Microstimulation of OPN stops saccades in mid-flight, which shows that OPN can end saccades. However, OPN pause duration does not correlate well with saccade duration, and saccades are normometric after OPN lesions. We tested whether OPN were responsible for stopping saccades both in late-onset Tay-Sachs, which causes premature saccadic termination, and in individuals with cerebellar hypermetria. We studied gaze shifts between two targets at different distances aligned on one eye, which consist of a disjunctive saccade followed by vergence. High-frequency conjugate oscillations during the vergence movements that followed saccades were present in all subjects studied, indicating OPN silence. Thus, mechanisms other than OPN discharge (e.g., cerebellar caudal fastigial nucleus-promoting inhibitory BN discharge) must contribute to saccade termination."

The clinical diagnoses of the affected infants were confirmed by their markedly deficient levels of HEXA activity in plasma or peripheral leukocytes. The specific causative mutation in each family was determined by sequencing the HEXA alleles in both sets of related parents. Two mutations were identified: c.1A>G (p.MIV), which obliterated the initiating methionine in codon 1, and c.1177C>T (p.R393X), which predicted a termination codon or nonsense mutation."

A recombinant human HexA (Om4HexA) with a high mannose 6-phosphate (M6P)-type-N-glycan content, which was produced by a methylotrophic yeast strain, Ogataea minuta, overexpressing the OmMNN4 gene, was intracerebroventricularly (ICV) administered to Sandhoff disease model mice (Hexb⁻/⁻ mice) at different doses (0.5-2.5 mg/kg), and then the replacement and therapeutic effects were examined. The Om4HexA was widely distributed across the ependymal cell layer, dose-dependently restored the enzyme activity due to uptake via cell surface cation-independent M6P receptor (CI-M6PR) on neural cells, and reduced substrates, including GM2 ganglioside (GM2), asialo GM2 (GA2), and oligosaccharides with terminal N-acetylglucosamine residues (GlcNAc-oligosaccharides), accumulated in brain parenchyma. A significant inhibition of chemokine macrophage inflammatory protein-1 α (MIP-1α) induction was also revealed, especially in the hindbrain (< 63%). The decrease in central neural storage correlated with an improvement of motor dysfunction as well as prolongation of the lifespan. This lysosome-directed recombinant human enzyme drug derived from methylotrophic yeast has the high therapeutic potential to improve the motor dysfunction and quality of life of the lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) patients with neurological manifestations. We emphasize the importance of neural cell surface M6P receptor as a delivery target of neural cell-directed enzyme replacement therapy (NCDERT) for neurodegenerative metabolic diseases."

We succeeded in producing the modified HexB by a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line stably expressing the chimeric HEXB, which can degrade artificial anionic substrates and GM2 ganglioside in vitro, and also retain the wild-type (WT) HexB-like thermostability in the presence of plasma. The modified HexB was efficiently incorporated via cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor into fibroblasts derived from Tay-Sachs patients, and reduced the GM2 ganglioside accumulated in the cultured cells. Furthermore, intracerebroventricular administration of the modified HexB to Sandhoff mode mice restored the Hex activity in the brains, and reduced the GM2 ganglioside storage in the parenchyma. These results suggest that the intracerebroventricular enzyme replacement therapy involving the modified HexB should be more effective for Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff than that utilizing the HexA, especially as a low-antigenic enzyme replacement therapy for Tay-Sachs patients who have endogenous WT HexB."

    "abstract": "Of 7028 disorders with suspected Mendelian inheritance, 1139 are recessive and have an established molecular basis. Although individually uncommon, Mendelian diseases collectively account for ~20% of infant mortality and ~10% of pediatric hospitalizations. Preconception screening, together with genetic counseling of carriers, has resulted in remarkable declines in the incidence of several severe recessive diseases including Tay-Sachs disease and cystic fibrosis. However, extension of preconception screening to most severe disease genes has hitherto been impractical. Here, we report a preconception carrier screen for 448 severe recessive childhood diseases. Rather than costly, complete sequencing of the human genome, 7717 regions from 437 target genes were enriched by hybrid capture or microdroplet polymerase chain reaction, sequenced by next-generation sequencing (NGS) to a depth of up to 2.7 gigabases, and assessed with stringent bioinformatic filters. At a resultant 160x average target coverage, 93% of nucleotides had at least 20x coverage, and mutation detection/genotyping had ~95% sensitivity and ~100% specificity for substitution, insertion/deletion, splicing, and gross deletion mutations and single-nucleotide polymorphisms. In 104 unrelated DNA samples, the average genomic carrier burden for severe pediatric recessive mutations was 2.8 and ranged from 0 to 7. The distribution of mutations among sequenced samples appeared random. Twenty-seven percent of mutations cited in the literature were found to be common polymorphisms or misannotated, underscoring the need for better mutation databases as part of a comprehensive carrier testing strategy. Given the magnitude of carrier burden and the lower cost of testing compared to treating these conditions, carrier screening by NGS made available to the general population may be an economical way to reduce the incidence of and ameliorate suffering associated with severe recessive childhood disorders."

    "abstract": "Tay-Sachs disease is a rare autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder that results from mutations in the HEXA gene, leading to β-hexosaminidase A (HexA) α subunit deficiency. An unusual variant of Tay-Sachs disease is known as the B1 variant. Previous studies indicated that, in northern Portugal, this is not only the most common variant but also one of the most prevalent lysosomal storage diseases. Additionally, this variant might also show a higher prevalence in populations of Portuguese and Spanish ancestry. A single mutation is invariably present in at least one of the alleles of B1 variant patients, HEXA mutation c.533G >A. To implement a method for c.533G >A testing in individuals and populations, we have optimized two distinct mutation analysis techniques, one based on restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and the other based on allelic discrimination. We present the comparison of both methods and their advantages. Mutation screening by allelic discrimination proved to be particularly useful for the studying of large samples of individuals. It is time saving and highly reproducible, and under the conditions used, its cost is lower than the cost of polymerase chain reaction-based restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis."

We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using clinical decline as measured by changes in the Clinical Dementia Rating-sum of boxes as a quantitative trait to test for single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that were associated with the rate of progression in 822 Caucasian subjects of amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI). There was no significant association with disease progress for any of the recently identified disease susceptibility variants in CLU, CR1, PICALM, BIN1, EPHA1, MS4A6A, MS4A4E or CD33 following multiple testing correction. We did, however, identify multiple novel loci that reached genome-wide significance at the 0.01 level. These top variants (rs7840202 at chr8 in UBR5: P=4.27 × 10(-14); rs11637611 with a cluster of SNPs at chr15q23 close to the Tay-Sachs disease locus: P=1.07 × 10(-15); and rs12752888 at chr1: P=3.08 × 10(-11)) were also associated with a significant decline in cognition as well as the conversion of subjects with MCI to a diagnosis of AD. Taken together, these variants define approximately 16.6% of the MCI sub-population with a faster rate of decline independent of the other known disease risk factors. In addition to providing new insights into protein pathways that may be involved with the progress to AD in MCI subjects, these variants if further validated may enable the identification of a more homogeneous population of subjects at an earlier stage of disease for testing novel hypotheses and/or therapies in the clinical setting."

PMT treatment was initiated at a dose of 6.25 mg, increasing gradually up to a maximal allowable dose of 75 mg daily at 4-6 weeks intervals for a total of up 10 months. Mean patients' age was 37.9±16.1 yrs (range 20-67 years). Lymphocyte HexA activity rose in all subjects, peaking at 78±30% over baseline activity (mean±SD; range 36-114%). The optimal PMT dose varied considerably, averaging at 30±24.1 mg (range-6.25-75 mg, daily). Further increase in PMT beyond the optimal dose was associated with gradual loss of effect on lymphocyte HexA. Improvement in speech was seen within several weeks in 4 out of 9 subjects, mostly paralleling the initial increment in HexA. Mood stabilization was also perceived in 3 subjects, but this was more difficult to assess due to the concomitant use of psychotropic/mood stabilizing agents. Reversible decline in motor activity manifesting predominantly in more frequent falls was seen in 3 subjects when the PMT dose was increased beyond the peak effect generating dose. PMT therapy can increase HexA activity in LOTS in vivo. Optimal doses should be tailored individually to avoid loss of biochemical effects. Clear cut neurological and psychiatric effects are difficult to discern at this time, mostly due to short term study follow up and large inter-individual variability."

Clinical findings included ataxia in all 4 limbs, proprioceptive deficits, and cortical blindness. At necropsy, the nervous system appeared grossly normal. Histologically, most neurons within the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral ganglia were enlarged, and the cytoplasm was distended by foamy to granular material that stained positively with Luxol fast blue and Sudan black B stains. Other neuropathologic findings included widespread astrocytosis, microgliosis, and scattered spheroids. Electron microscopy revealed membranous cytoplasmic bodies within the cytoplasm of neurons. Biochemical and molecular genetic studies confirmed the diagnosis of G(M2) gangliosidosis. This form of G(M2) gangliosidosis in Jacob sheep is very similar to human Tay-Sachs disease and is potentially a useful animal model."

    "abstract": "Late-onset GM2 gangliosidosis is an autosomal recessive, neurodegenerative, lysosomal storage disease, caused by deficiency of ß-hexosaminidase A (Hex A), resulting from mutations in the HEXA (Tay-Sachs variant) or the HEXB (Sandhoff variant) genes. The enzyme deficiency in many patients with juvenile or adult onset forms of the disease results from the production of an unstable protein, which becomes targeted for premature degradation by the quality control system of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum and is not transported to lysosomes. In vitro studies have shown that many mutations in either the α or β subunit of Hex A can be partially rescued, i.e. enhanced levels of both enzyme protein and activity in lysosomes, following the growth of patient cells in the presence of the drug, pyrimethamine. The objectives of the present clinical trial were to establish the tolerability and efficacy of the treatment of late-onset GM2 gangliosidosis patients with escalating doses of pyrimethamine, to a maximum of 100 mg per day, administered orally in a single daily dose, over a 16-week period . The primary objective, tolerability, was assessed by regular clinical examinations, along with a panel of hematologic and biochemical studies. Although clinical efficacy could not be assessed in this short trial, treatment efficacy was evaluated by repeated measurements of leukocyte Hex A activity, expressed relative to the activity of lysosomal ß-glucuronidase. A total of 11 patients were enrolled, 8 males and 3 females, aged 23 to 50 years. One subject failed the initial screen, another was omitted from analysis because of the large number of protocol violations, and a third was withdrawn very early as a result of adverse events which were not drug-related. For the remaining 8 subjects, up to a 4-fold enhancement of Hex A activity at doses of 50 mg per day or less was observed. Additionally marked individual variations in the pharmacokinetics of the drug among the patients were noted. However, the study also found that significant side effects were experienced by most patients at or above 75 mg pyrimethamine per day. We concluded that pyrimethamine treatment enhances leukocyte Hex A activity in patients with late-onset GM2 gangliosidosis at doses lower than those associated with unacceptable side effects. Further plans are underway to extend these trials and to develop methods to assess clinical efficacy."

    "abstract": "Tay-Sachs disease is a severe lysosomal disorder caused by mutations in the HexA gene coding for the α-subunit of lysosomal β-hexosaminidase A, which converts G(M2) to G(M3) ganglioside. Hexa(-/-) mice, depleted of β-hexosaminidase A, remain asymptomatic to 1 year of age, because they catabolise G(M2) ganglioside via a lysosomal sialidase into glycolipid G(A2), which is further processed by β-hexosaminidase B to lactosyl-ceramide, thereby bypassing the β-hexosaminidase A defect. Since this bypass is not effective in humans, infantile Tay-Sachs disease is fatal in the first years of life. Previously, we identified a novel ganglioside metabolizing sialidase, Neu4, abundantly expressed in mouse brain neurons. Now we demonstrate that mice with targeted disruption of both Neu4 and Hexa genes (Neu4(-/-);Hexa(-/-)) show epileptic seizures with 40% penetrance correlating with polyspike discharges on the cortical electrodes of the electroencephalogram. Single knockout Hexa(-/-) or Neu4(-/-) siblings do not show such symptoms. Further, double-knockout but not single-knockout mice have multiple degenerating neurons in the cortex and hippocampus and multiple layers of cortical neurons accumulating G(M2) ganglioside. Together, our data suggest that the Neu4 block exacerbates the disease in Hexa(-/-) mice, indicating that Neu4 is a modifier gene in the mouse model of Tay-Sachs disease, reducing the disease severity through the metabolic bypass. However, while disease severity in the double mutant is increased, it is not profound suggesting that Neu4 is not the only sialidase contributing to the metabolic bypass in Hexa(-/-) mice."

Lysosomal enzyme studies of brain and liver from an affected animal revealed diminished activity of hexosaminidase A (Hex A) measured with an artificial substrate specific for this component of β-hexosaminidase. Absence of Hex A activity was confirmed by cellulose acetate electrophoresis. Brain lipid analyses demonstrated the presence of increased concentrations of G(M2)-ganglioside and asialo-G(M2)-ganglioside. The hexa cDNA of Jacob sheep was cloned and sequenced revealing an identical number of nucleotides and exons as in human HexA and 86% homology in nucleotide sequence. A missense mutation was found in the hexa cDNA of the affected sheep caused by a single nucleotide change at the end of exon 11 resulting in skipping of exon 11. Transfection of normal sheep hexa cDNA into COS1 cells and human Hex A-deficient cells led to expression of Hex S but no increase in Hex A indicating absence of cross-species dimerization of sheep Hex α-subunit with human Hex β-subunits. Using restriction site analysis, the heterozygote frequency of this mutation in Jacob sheep was determined in three geographically separate flocks to average 14%. This large naturally occurring animal model of Tay-Sachs disease is the first to offer promise as a means for trials of gene therapy applicable to human infants."

Using a community-based model previously employed with Tay-Sachs disease prevention, we developed a pilot program for the Persian Jewish community of greater Los Angeles. We screened for mutations responsible for four relatively frequent autosomal recessive conditions in Persian Jews in which effective interventions are available for each: Pseudocholinesterase deficiency (butyryl cholinesterase deficiency); Congenital hypoaldosteronism (corticosterone methyl oxidase II); Autoimmune polyendocrinopathy (autoimmune regulatory element); and Hereditary Inclusion Body myopathy. One thousand individuals volunteered. Mutations were assessed in saliva-derived DNA and were positive for 121/1000 butyryl cholinesterase deficiency; 92/1000 Hereditary Inclusion Body myopathy; 38/1000 corticosterone methyl oxidase II; and 37/1000 autoimmune regulatory element. Ten homozygous individuals (9 butyryl cholinesterase deficiency and 1 Hereditary Inclusion Body myopathy) and 10 \"at-risk\" couples (seven for butyryl cholinesterase deficiency and one each for the other three disorders) were identified. These frequencies are comparable with those in Israel and indicate an extraordinary level of inbreeding, as anticipated. A carefully planned effort can be delivered to an \"increased risk\" community if detailed attention is given to planning and organization. However, availability of an effective intervention for those found to be \"at-risk\" or possibly affected, is essential before embarking."

This need has been addressed by designing a universal carrier test: a non-invasive, saliva-based assay for more than 100 Mendelian diseases across all major population groups. The test has been exhaustively validated with a median of 147 positive and 525 negative samples per variant, demonstrating a multiplex assay whose performance compares favourably with the previous standard of care, namely blood-based single-gene carrier tests. Because the test represents a dramatic reduction in the cost and complexity of large-scale population screening, an end to many preventable genetic diseases is now in sight. Moreover, given that the assay is inexpensive and requires only a saliva sample, it is now increasingly feasible to make carrier testing a routine part of preconception care."

This protocol allows visualization of many different lipid species and, of particular interest, sphingolipids in tissue slices of Tay-Sachs/Sandhoff disease by imaging MALDI-MS. The structures of these lipids were identified by analysis of tissue extracts using electrospray ionization in conjunction with tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS and MS(3)). These results illustrate the usefulness of tissue imaging MALDI-MS with matrix deposition by OCN for the molecular analysis in normal physiology and pathology.

In this 12 year retrospective cohort study, results of enhanced universal screening of all anonymous oocyte donor candidates from 1997 to 2008 at a university hospital oocyte donation program were reviewed. Primary outcomes were the frequency of oocyte donor candidates excluded as a result of enhanced universal screening (Tay-Sachs, Fragile X, karyotypic analysis and MMPI-2) versus basic screening according to ASRM guidelines. Of 1303 candidates who underwent on-site evaluation, 47% passed the screening process, 23% were lost to follow-up and 31% were excluded. Genetic and psychological factors accounted for the most common reasons for candidate exclusion. Enhanced genetic screening excluded an additional 25 candidates (19% of all genetic exclusions) and enhanced psychological screening excluded an additional 15 candidates (12% of all psychological exclusions). Altogether enhanced screening accounted for 40 candidates (10%) of the total pool of excluded candidates. Although our study is limited by its retrospective nature and center-specific conclusions, we show that enhanced comprehensive screening can exclude a significant number of candidates from an oocyte donor program and should be encouraged to assure optimal short-term and long-term outcomes for pregnancies achieved through oocyte donation."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the current programme and compare it with an evaluation of the programme when screening was offered for TSD alone. All students from Jewish high schools in Melbourne who offered the programme in 2009 were invited to participate in the study. A purpose-designed questionnaire explored the following domains: knowledge (disease and genetics), reasons for screening, anxiety, and predicted negative feelings if found to be a carrier. Two hundred and seventy-three students were offered screening, and 272 (99.6%) completed the questionnaire. Only two students chose not to have screening. Two hundred and seventy-one students were in the penultimate year of high school (99.6%) and 222 were of Ashkenazi Jewish descent (82.5%). The main reasons for choosing screening were the desire to know carrier status and convenience. Knowledge level decreased and negative feelings increased in the current cohort compared to that when screening was offered for TSD alone. We conclude that the current programme is efficient, although increasing the number of conditions resulted in a decrease in knowledge and increase in predicted negative feelings if found to be a carrier of one of the conditions. This has implications for multi-disease screening programmes that will increase in frequency as more conditions can be screened for and costs diminish."

The mutant HexA (NgHexA) obtained from a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line co-expressing the mutated HEXA and wild-type HEXB complementary DNAs was demonstrated to contain an additional mannose-6-phosphate (M6P)-type-N-glycan. NgHexA was more efficiently taken up than the wild-type HexA and delivered to lysosomes, where it degraded accumulated substrates including GM2 ganglioside (GM2) when administered to cultured fibroblasts derived from a Sandhoff disease (SD) patient. On intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of NgHexA to SD model mice, NgHexA more efficiently restored the HexA activity and reduced the GM2 and GA2 (asialoGM2) accumulated in neural cells of the brain parenchyma than the wild-type HexA. These findings indicate that i.c.v. administration of the modified human HexA with an additional M6P-type N-glycan is applicable for enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) involving an M6P-receptor as a molecular target for HexA deficiencies including Tay-Sachs disease and SD."

    "abstract": "Genetic testing for Tay-Sachs and Canavan disease is particularly important for Ashkenazi Jews, because both conditions are more frequent in that population. This comparative case study was possible because of different patenting and licensing practices. The role of DNA testing differs between Tay-Sachs and Canavan diseases. The first-line screening test for Tay-Sachs remains an enzyme activity test rather than genotyping. Genotyping is used for preimplantation diagnosis and confirmatory testing. In contrast, DNA-based testing is the basis for Canavan screening and diagnosis. The HEXA gene for Tay-Sachs was cloned at the National Institutes of Health, and the gene was patented but has not been licensed. The ASPA gene for Canavan disease was cloned and patented by Miami Children's Hospital. Miami Children's Hospital did not inform family members and patient groups that had contributed to the gene discovery that it was applying for a patent, and pursued restrictive licensing practices when a patent issued in 1997. This led to intense controversy, litigation, and a sealed, nonpublic 2003 settlement that apparently allowed for nonexclusive licensing. A survey of laboratories revealed a possible price premium for ASPA testing, with per-unit costs higher than for other genetic tests in the Secretary's Advisory Committee on Genetics, Health, and Society case studies. The main conclusion from comparing genetic testing for Tay-Sachs and Canavan diseases, however, is that patenting and licensing conducted without communication with patients and advocates cause mistrust and can lead to controversy and litigation, a negative model to contrast with the positive model of patenting and licensing for genetic testing of cystic fibrosis."

Two mutations are novel, c.814G>A (p.Gly272Arg) and c.1305C>T (p.=), located in exon 8 and in exon 11, respectively. The third mutation, c.1195A>G (p.Asn399Asp) in exon 11, has been previously characterized as a common polymorphism in African-Americans. Hex A activity measured in TSD Glial cells, transfected with HEXA cDNA constructs bearing these mutations, was unaltered from the activity level measured in normal HEXA cDNA. Analysis of RT-PCR products revealed three aberrant transcripts in the patient, one where exon 8 was absent, one where exon 11 was absent and a third lacking both exons 10 and 11. All three novel transcripts contain frameshifts resulting in premature termination codons (PTCs). Transfection of mini-gene constructs carrying the c.814G>A and c.1305C>T mutations proved that the two mutations result in exon skipping. mRNAs that harbor a PTC are detected and degraded by the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway to prevent synthesis of abnormal proteins. However, although NMD is functional in the patient's fibroblasts, aberrant transcripts are still present. We suggest that the level of correctly spliced transcripts as well as the efficiency in which NMD degrade the PTC-containing transcripts, apparently plays an important role in the phenotype severity of the unique patient and thus should be considered as a potential target for drug therapy."

    "abstract": "To investigate the influence of amplicons size and cell type on allele dropout and amplification failures in single-cell based molecular diagnosis. 730 single lymphocytes and amniotic cells were collected from known heterozygotes individuals to one of the common Ashkenazi Jewish mutations: 1278+TATC and IVS12+1G>C which cause Tay Sachs Disease, IVS20+6T and 854A>C which underlie Familial Dysautonomia and Canavan Disease. DNA was extracted and analyzed by our routine methods. Reduced rates of allele dropout and amplification failure were found when smaller amplification product were designed and in amniotic cultured cells compared to peripheral lymphocytes. Cultured lymphocytes, induced to divide, demonstrated significantly less allele dropout than non induced lymphocytes suggesting the role of division potential on amplification efficiency. Single cell based diagnosis should be designed for each mutation. Minimal sized amplicons and cell having division potential should be preferred, as well as sensitive techniques to detect preferential amplification."

    "abstract": "Sandhoff and Tay-Sachs disease are autosomal recessive GM2 gangliosidoses where a deficiency of lysosomal beta-hexosaminidase results in storage of glycoconjugates. Imino sugar (2-acetamido-1,4-imino-1,2,4-trideoxy-L-arabinitol) inhibition of beta-hexosaminidase in murine RAW264.7 macrophage-like cells led to lysosomal storage of glycoconjugates that were characterised structurally using fluorescence labelling of the free or glycolipid-derived oligosaccharides followed by HPLC and mass spectrometry. Stored glycoconjugates were confirmed as containing non-reducing GlcNAc or GalNAc residues resulting from the incomplete degradation of N-linked glycoprotein oligosaccharide and glycolipids, respectively. When substrate reduction therapeutics N-butyl-deoxynojirimycin (NB-DNJ) or N-butyldeoxygalactonojirimycin (NB-DGJ) were applied to the storage phenotype cells, an increase in glucosylated and galactosylated oligosaccharide species was observed due to endoplasmic reticulum alpha-glucosidases and lysosomal beta-galactosidase inhibition, respectively. Hexosaminidase inhibition triggered a tightly regulated cytokine-mediated inflammatory response that was normalised using imino sugars NB-DNJ and NB-DGJ, which restored the GM2 ganglioside storage burden but failed to reduce the levels of GA2 glycolipid or glycoprotein-derived N-linked oligosaccharides. Using a chemically induced gangliosidosis phenotype that can be modulated with substrate lowering drugs, the critical role of GM2 ganglioside in the progression of inflammatory disease is also demonstrated."

    "title": "Reclaiming the patient's voice and spirit in dying: an insight from Israel.",
    "abstract": "In the latter half of the 20th century, Western medicine moved death from the home to the hospital. As a result, the process of dying seems to have lost its spiritual dimension, and become a matter of prolonging material life by means of medical technology. The novel quandaries that arose led in turn to medico-legal regulation. This paper describes the recent regulation of dying in Israel under its Dying Patient Law, 2005. The Law recognizes advance directives in principle, but limits their effect and form through complex medico-legal artifices. It reflects a culture that places high value on both scientific medicine and the sanctity of life as such, and illustrates a medical culture that pitches battle against death. At the same time, the Law constructs the will of the individual in a medico-legal language that is alien to the lay person. The paper suggests an alternative approach to advance care planning that is patient-centred and addresses the psycho-social needs of the individual in terms of her relational autonomy. From this perspective, advance care planning becomes an opportunity to extract the patient from the medical context and allow her to speak about her approaching death with close ones in her own terms of reference. To this end, there is a need for facilitation of an intimate encounter where patients can speak about their concerns with their loved ones. The paper also presents a methodological approach of attentive listening, which can be applied across diverse cultures and circumstances."

    "abstract": "Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) is a recessively inherited neurodegenerative disorder due to mutations in the HEXA gene resulting in a beta-hexosaminidase A (Hex A) deficiency. The purpose of this study was to characterize the molecular abnormalities in patients with infantile or later-onset forms of the disease. The complete sequencing of the 14 exons and flanking regions of the HEXA gene was performed with a unique technical condition in 10 unrelated TSD patients. Eleven mutations were identified, including five splice mutations, one insertion, two deletions and three single-base substitutions. Four mutations were novel: two splice mutations (IVS8+5G>A, IVS2+4delAGTA), one missense mutation in exon 6 (c.621T>G (p.D207E)) and one small deletion (c.1211-1212delTG) in exon 11 resulting in a premature stop codon at residue 429. The c.621T>G missense mutation was found in a patient presenting an infantile form. Its putative role in the pathogenesis of TSD is suspected as residue 207 is highly conserved in human, mouse and rat. Moreover, structural modelling predicted changes likely to affect substrate binding and catalytic activity of the enzyme. The time-saving procedure reported here could be useful for the characterization of Tay-Sachs-causing mutations, in particular in non-Ashkenazi patients mainly exhibiting rare mutations."

    "abstract": "Enzyme enhancement therapy, utilizing small molecules as pharmacological chaperones, is an attractive approach for the treatment of lysosomal storage diseases that are associated with protein misfolding. However, pharmacological chaperones are also inhibitors of their target enzyme. Thus, a major concern with this approach is that, despite enhancing protein folding within, and intracellular transport of the functional mutant enzyme out of the endoplasmic reticulum, the chaperone will continue to inhibit the enzyme in the lysosome, preventing substrate clearance. Here we demonstrate that the in vitro hydrolysis of a fluorescent derivative of lyso-GM2 ganglioside, like natural GM2 ganglioside, is specifically carried out by the beta-hexosaminidase A isozyme, requires the GM2 activator protein as a co-factor, increases when the derivative is incorporated into anionic liposomes and follows similar Michaelis-Menten kinetics. This substrate can also be used to differentiate between lysates from normal and GM2 activator-deficient cells. When added to the growth medium of cells, the substrate is internalized and primarily incorporated into lysosomes. Utilizing adult Tay-Sachs fibroblasts that have been pre-treated with the pharmacological chaperone Pyrimethamine and subsequently loaded with this substrate, we demonstrate an increase in both the levels of mutant beta-hexosaminidase A and substrate-hydrolysis as compared to mock-treated cells."

    "abstract": "Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) carrier screening, initiated in the 1970s, has reduced the birth-rate of Ashkenazi Jews with TSD worldwide by 90%. Recently, several nationwide programs have been established that provide carrier screening for the updated panel of Jewish genetic diseases on college campuses and in Jewish community settings. The goals of this study were to determine the performance characteristics of clinical TSD testing in college- and community-based screening programs and to determine if molecular testing alone is adequate in those settings. Clinical data for TSD testing were retrospectively anonymized and subsequently analyzed for 1,036 individuals who participated in these programs. The performance characteristics of the serum and the platelet Hexosaminidase assays were compared, and also correlated with the results of targeted DNA analysis. The serum assay identified 29 carriers and the platelet assay identified 35 carriers for carrier rates of 1/36 and 1/29, respectively. One hundred sixty-nine samples (16.3%) were inconclusive by serum assay in marked contrast to four inconclusive samples (0.4%) by the platelet assay. Molecular analysis alone would have missed four of the 35 carriers detected by the platelet assay, yielding a false negative rate of 11.4% with a sensitivity of 88.6%. Based on the results of this study, platelet assay was superior to serum with a minimal inconclusive rate. Due to changing demographics of the Ashkenazi Jewish population, molecular testing alone in the setting of broad-based population screening programs is not sufficient, and biochemical analysis should be the assay of choice."

We performed a literature review and key informant interviews. Factors involved in the success of TSD and beta-thalassemia carrier screening programs include disease characteristics (well-defined population at risk, severe disease with predictable course, availability of effective treatment), test characteristics (high sensitivity, straightforward interpretation of results), and community characteristics (involvement of community, support of families and advocacy groups, consensus in favor of avoiding affected births). Current CF screening strategies include few of the factors listed above. Unlike TSD and beta-thalassemia, the purpose of current CF carrier screening strategies is informed reproductive decision-making, without an explicit goal of reducing disease incidence. When compared to TSD and beta-thalassemia, CF is a less favorable candidate for population-based carrier screening. Because of its different purpose, CF carrier screening will require different measures of success than those used for TSD and beta-thalassemia carrier screening, and a consensus on the value or success of CF carrier screening may be difficult to achieve."

We performed a HEXA gene sequencing assay, a HEXA DNA common mutation assay, and a HEXA enzyme assay on 34 self-reported Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) carriers, six late-onset patients with TSD, and one pseudodeficiency allele carrier. Sensitivity of TSD carrier detection was 91% for gene sequencing compared with 91% for the enzyme assay and 52% for the DNA mutation assay. Gene sequencing combined with enzyme testing had the highest sensitivity (100%) for carrier detection. Gene sequencing detected four novel mutations, three of which are predicted to be disease causing [118.delT, 965A-->T (D322V), and 775A-->G (T259A)]. Gene sequencing is useful in identifying rare mutations in patients with TSD and their families, in evaluating spouses of known carriers for TSD who have indeterminate enzyme analysis and negative for common mutation analysis, and in resolving ambiguous enzyme testing results."

Although enzyme-replacement therapy is an effective treatment for the visceral manifestations of some of these disorders, this approach has not, to date, been useful in CNS disease. Substrate reduction therapy (SRT) is an alternative approach to treatment in which the aim is to reduce the rate of synthesis of GSL to a level where the residual enzyme activity in the affected cell can prevent lysosomal storage. Miglustat, an iminosugar, is an inhibitor of the first step of GSL synthesis and has been used successfully for SRT in Gaucher disease. Miglustat is a small molecule and can enter the brain. It has been shown to delay symptom onset and prolong life in a number of animal models of GSL LSDs.

It was hypothesized that these drugs act on the endoplasmic reticulum, increasing its folding efficiency, inhibited due to altered calcium homeostasis. Several other laboratories have reported that cells carrying either the N370S or the F213I alleles are amenable to enzyme enhancement therapy with pharmacological chaperones, whereas cells homozygous for L444P respond poorly. We found that Verapamil treatment does not enhance mutant enzyme activity in any of the cell lines tested, while Diltiazem moderately increases activity in normal cells, and in N370S/N370S and F213I/L444P, but not in L444P/L444P Gaucher cells, or in either of two adult Tay-Sachs disease cell lines. Since the mode of action of pharmacological chaperones and Diltiazem are believed to be different, we examined the possibility that they could act in concert. Diltiazem co-administered with known chaperones failed to increase enzyme activities above that reached by chaperone-treatment alone in any of the patient cell lines. Thus, we re-examined the possibility that Diltiazem acts as a pharmacological chaperone. We found that, at the acidic pH of lysosomes, Diltiazem was not an inhibitor, nor did its presence increase the heat stability of glucocerebrosidase. However, at neutral pH, found in the endoplasmic reticulum, Diltiazem exhibited both of these properties. Thus Diltiazem exhibits the biochemical characteristics of a glucocerebrosidase pharmacological chaperone."

Further, by comparing NPCs and their differentiated progeny established from Tay-Sachs (TS) and Sandhoff (SD) animal models with the wild-type counterparts, we studied the events linking the accumulation of undegraded substrates to hexosaminidase activity. We showed that similarly to what observed in brain tissues in TS NPCs and progeny, the stored GM2 was partially converted by sialidase to GA2, which can be then degraded in the lysosomes to its components. The latter can be used in a salvage pathway for the formation of GM3. Interestingly, results obtained from ganglioside feeding assays and from measurement of lysosomal sialidase activity suggest that a similar pathway might work also in the SD model."

    "abstract": "N-Acetylhexosaminidases are of considerable importance in mammals and are involved in various significant biological processes. In humans, deficiencies of these enzymes in the lysosome, resulting from inherited genetic defects, cause the glycolipid storage disorders Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff diseases. One promising therapy for these diseases involves the use of beta-N-acetylhexosaminidase inhibitors as chemical chaperones to enhance the enzyme activity above sub-critical levels. Herein we describe the synthesis and biological evaluation of a potent inhibitor, 2-acetamido-1,4-imino-1,2,4-trideoxy-L-arabinitol (LABNAc), in a high-yielding 11-step procedure from D-lyxonolactone. The N-benzyl and N-butyl analogues were also prepared and found to be potent inhibitors. The enantiomers DABNAc and NBn-DABNAc were synthesised from L-lyxonolactone, and were also evaluated. The L-iminosugar LABNAc and its derivatives were found to be potent noncompetitive inhibitors of some beta-N-acetylhexosaminidases, while the D-iminosugar DABNAc and its derivatives were found to be weaker competitive inhibitors. These results support previous work postulating that D-iminosugar mimics inhibit D-glycohydrolases competitively, and that their corresponding L-enantiomers show noncompetitive inhibition of these enzymes. Molecular modelling studies confirm that the spatial organisation in enantiomeric inhibitors leads to a different overlay with the monosaccharide substrate. Initial cell-based studies suggest that NBn-LABNAc can act as a chemical chaperone to enhance the deficient enzyme's activity to levels that may cause a positive pharmacological effect. LABNAc, NBn-LABNAc, and NBu-LABNAc are potent and selective inhibitors of beta-N-acetylhexosaminidase and may be useful as therapeutic agents for treating adult Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff diseases."

    "abstract": "Low volatility, lipid-like cuticular hydrocarbon pheromones produced by Drosophila melanogaster females play an essential role in triggering and modulating mating behavior, but the chemosensory mechanisms involved remain poorly understood. Recently, we showed that the CheB42a protein, which is expressed in only 10 pheromone-sensing taste hairs on the front legs of males, modulates progression to late stages of male courtship behavior in response to female-specific cuticular hydrocarbons. Here we report that expression of all 12 genes in the CheB gene family is predominantly or exclusively gustatory-specific, and occurs in many different, often non-overlapping patterns. Only the Gr family of gustatory receptor genes displays a comparable variety of gustatory-specific expression patterns. Unlike Grs, however, expression of all but one CheB gene is sexually dimorphic. Like CheB42a, other CheBs may therefore function specifically in gustatory perception of pheromones. We also show that CheBs belong to the ML superfamily of lipid-binding proteins, and are most similar to human GM2-activator protein (GM2-AP). In particular, GM2-AP residues involved in ligand binding are conserved in CheBs but not in other ML proteins. Finally, CheB42a is specifically secreted into the inner lumen of pheromone-sensing taste hairs, where pheromones interact with membrane-bound receptors. We propose that CheB proteins interact directly with lipid-like Drosophila pheromones and modulate their detection by the gustatory signal transduction machinery. Furthermore, as loss of GM2-AP in Tay-Sachs disease prevents degradation of GM2 gangliosides and results in neurodegeneration, the function of CheBs in pheromone response may involve biochemical mechanisms critical for lipid metabolism in human neurons."

    "abstract": "Autopsy studies of late-onset GM2 gangliosidosis are sparse and only one adult case is on record. The case of partial Hex A deficiency presented here started in childhood as spinal muscular atrophy which progressed slowly over 4 decades. Cognitive function remained intact throughout the entire course, but during the last few years of life allodynia supervened. The patient died at 44 years of age. In good correlation with clinical observations the autopsy findings showed the most severe accumulation of lipid and consequent regressive change in the anterior horns of the spinal cord. Extensive but less severe storage was found in other spinal cord neurons, brain stem and selected basal ganglia. Cerebral cortex was virtually spared by storage but was the site of excessive formation of lipofuscin which was also present in many other neurons in the CNS. Marked storage and ganglionic loss was also found in the dorsal root ganglia, and the fasciculus gracilis was severely depleted of myelinated fibers. Electron microscopy showed accumulated gangliosides almost exclusively in the form of single and coalescing zebra bodies. In conclusion, the pathology in this case of chronic GM2 gangliosidosis, though in part conforming with previous observations, differed in several aspects. First, the cerebral cortex was--with only a few exceptions--free of ganglioside storage. Also spared was the cerebellum. In addition, homogeneous accumulation of zebra bodies contrasted with heterogeneity of neuronal inclusions found in other chronic cases. Finally, the involvement of sensory neurons was prominent and potentially related to allodynia. Molecular study of HEXA gene in this patient showed an TATC1278/? genotype."

    "title": "Chemical and biological approaches synergize to ameliorate protein-folding diseases.",
    "abstract": "Loss-of-function diseases are often caused by a mutation in a protein traversing the secretory pathway that compromises the normal balance between protein folding, trafficking, and degradation. We demonstrate that the innate cellular protein homeostasis, or proteostasis, capacity can be enhanced to fold mutated enzymes that would otherwise misfold and be degraded, using small molecule proteostasis regulators. Two proteostasis regulators are reported that alter the composition of the proteostasis network in the endoplasmic reticulum through the unfolded protein response, increasing the mutant folded protein concentration that can engage the trafficking machinery, restoring function to two nonhomologous mutant enzymes associated with distinct lysosomal storage diseases. Coapplication of a pharmacologic chaperone and a proteostasis regulator exhibits synergy because of the former's ability to further increase the concentration of trafficking-competent mutant folded enzymes. It may be possible to ameliorate loss-of-function diseases by using proteostasis regulators alone or in combination with a pharmacologic chaperone."

The possibilities offered by lipidomics for diagnosis and follow-up after enzyme replacement therapy are presented from a practical perspective. The contribution of HPLC coupled with tandem mass spectrometry has considerably simplified the detection and assay of abnormal metabolites. Corresponding internal standards consisting of weighed mixtures of the stable-isotope labeled metabolites required to calibrate and quantitate lipid components of these orphan diseases standards have yet to become commercially available. A lipidomics approach has been found to compare favorably with DNA-sequence analysis for the rapid diagnosis of pre-birth syndromes resulting from these multiple gene defects. The method also seems to be suitable for screening applications in terms of a high throughput combined with a low rate of false diagnoses based on the wide differences in metabolite concentrations found in affected patients as compared with normal subjects. The practical advantages of handling samples for lipidomic diagnoses as compared to enzyme assay are presented for application to diagnosis during pregnancy."

    "abstract": "In late-onset Tay-Sachs disease (LOTS), saccades are interrupted by one or more transient decelerations. Some saccades reaccelerate and continue on before eye velocity reaches zero, even in darkness. Intervals between successive decelerations are not regularly spaced. Peak decelerations of horizontal and vertical components of oblique saccades in LOTS is more synchronous than those in control subjects.

In late-onset Tay-Sachs (LOTS), intrasaccadic transient decelerations occur that may result from (1) premature omnipause neuron (OPN) re-activation due to malfunction of the latch circuit that inhibits OPNs for the duration of the saccade or (2) premature inhibitory burst neuron (IBN) activation due to fastigial nucleus (FN) dysregulation by the dorsal cerebellar vermis. Neuroanatomic analysis of a LOTS brain was performed. Purkinje cells were absent and gliosis of the granular cell layer was present in the dorsal cerebellar vermis. Deep cerebellar nuclei contained large inclusions. IBNs were present with small inclusions. The sample did not contain the complete OPN region; however, neurons in the OPN region contained massive inclusions. Pathologic findings suggest that premature OPN re-activation and/or inappropriate firing of IBNs may be responsible for interrupted saccades in LOTS. Cerebellar clinical dysfunction, lack of saccadic slowing, and significant loss of cerebellar cells suggest that the second cause is more likely."

    "abstract": "Saccades are rapid shifts of gaze that normally place the line of sight on a desired target with a single smooth movement. A number of disease states have been shown to result in saccadic movements that are fragmented, but still end near target position after a multi-step sequence of saccades. Among these disorders are Parkinson's disease and late-onset Tay-Sachs disease (LOTS). We have recently shown that normal human subjects and monkeys also make some two-step saccadic responses in cognitively difficult, choice response tasks. In monkeys we have been able to record neuronal responses as the animals performed a visually guided, choice saccade task. We compared the activity of neurons in the superior colliculus (SC) and the cortical frontal eye field (FEF) during the majority of trials that were accomplished with single-step saccades with those completed with two-step saccades. Several differences in discharge pattern aligned on the first saccade were uncovered. Neurons in the rostral and caudal SC were not modulated at the time of the first saccade, but a class of FEF neurons showed a burst of activity before the first saccade. If these neurons are among those known to project to the saccade generator in the brainstem, they could trigger the onset of a saccade before the remaining machinery in the saccade generator had sufficient activity to sustain the saccade. Overall the results suggest that a delicate balance of triggering and sustaining inputs are required to produce normal single-step saccades. These neural results may also help to clarify the pathology present when fragmented saccades occur in various disease states."

Deficiency of Hex A in TSD is caused by a defect of the alpha-subunit resulting from mutations of the HEXA gene. To date, there is no effective treatment for TSD. Animal models of genetic diseases, similar to those known to exist in humans, are valuable and essential research tools for the study of potentially effective therapies. However, there is no ideal animal model of TSD available for use in therapeutic trials. In the present study, we report an animal model (American flamingo; Phoenicopterus ruber) of TSD with Hex A deficiency occurring spontaneously in nature, with accumulation of G(M2)-ganglioside, deficiency of Hex A enzymatic activity, and a homozygous P469L mutation in exon 12 of the hexa gene. In addition, we have isolated the full-length cDNA sequence of the flamingo, which consists of 1581 nucleotides encoding a protein of 527 amino acids. Its coding sequence indicates approximately 71% identity at the nucleotide level and about 72.5% identity at the amino acid level with the encoding region of the human HEXA gene. This animal model, with many of the same features as TSD in humans, could represent a valuable resource for investigating therapy of TSD."

Clinical manifestations primarily involve the central nervous system (CNS) and lower motor neurons, and include ataxia, weakness, spasticity, dysarthria, dysphagia, dystonia, seizures, psychosis, mania, depression, and cognitive decline. The prevalence of peripheral nervous system (PNS) involvement in LOTS has not been well documented, but it has traditionally been thought to be very low.

Couples at risk of having a child with one of these conditions have a number of reproductive options to avoid having a child with the condition should they wish. In Australia the haemoglobinopathies are the only group of conditions for which population screening is widely offered and which is government funded. In some Australian states there are also population screening programs for cystic fibrosis and autosomal recessive conditions more common in Ashkenazi Jewish individuals which are generally offered on a user pays basis. It is predicted that as consumer demand increases and testing becomes cheaper, that many people planning or in the early stages of pregnancy will have carrier screening for multiple genetic conditions. This will have significant implications for genetic counseling, laboratory and prenatal testing resources. In addition such screening raises a number of ethical issues including the value of lives of those born with genetic conditions for which screening is available."

In the infantile Tay-Sachs group, the number of atoms influenced by a mutation was generally larger than that in the late-onset Tay-Sachs group in both the main chain and the side chain, and residues associated with the mutations found in the infantile Tay-Sachs group tended to be less solvent-accessible than those in the late-onset Tay-Sachs group. Furthermore, color imaging determined the distribution and degree of the structural changes caused by representative amino acid substitutions, and that there were also differences between the infantile and late-onset Tay-Sachs disease groups. Structural study is useful for elucidating the basis of Tay-Sachs disease."

Prenatal diagnosis of Tay-Sachs disease is accomplished within 24-48 h from sampling.

Ethnicity-based screening for single gene disorders includes Tay Sachs disease, cystic fibrosis, and hemoglobinopathies. Recent discussions have involved, not only additional disorders that warrant screening, but a re-evaluation of the paradigm of selecting disorders for population-based screening. Testing for chromosomal abnormalities has seen the introduction of first-trimester screening, as well as strategies to improve detection through sequential testing. Changes in recommendations for screening compared with diagnostic testing, and a move away from maternal age-based dichotomizing of testing, have had major implications for provision of genetic counseling by providers of prenatal care. Advances in genetic testing have resulted in tremendous benefits to patients, and challenges to providers. New approaches to education and counseling are needed to assure that all patients receive a complete and balanced review of their prenatal genetic-testing options."

    "abstract": "The quality of tissue imaging by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) depends on the effectiveness of the matrix deposition, especially for lipids that may dissolve in the solvent used for the matrix application. This article describes the use of an oscillating capillary nebulizer (OCN) to spray small droplets of matrix aerosol onto the sample surface for improved matrix homogeneity, reduced crystal size, and controlled solvent effects. This system was then applied to the analysis of histological slices of brains from mice with homozygous disruption of the hexb gene (hexb-/-), a model of Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff disease, versus the functionally normal heterozygote (hexb+/-) by imaging MALDI-MS. This allowed profiling and localization of many different lipid species, and of particular interest, ganglioside GM2, asialo-GM2 (GA2), and sulfatides (ST). The presence of these compounds was confirmed by analysis of brain extracts using electrospray ionization in conjunction with tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). The major fatty acid of the ceramide backbone of both GM2 and GA2 was identified as stearic acid (18:0) versus nervonic acid (24:1) for ST by both tissue-imaging MS and ESI-MS/MS. GM2 and GA2 were highly elevated in hexb-/- and were both localized in the granular cell region of the cerebellum. ST, however, was localized mainly in myelinated fiber (white matter) region of the cerebellum as well as in the brain stem with a relatively uniform distribution and had similar relative signal intensity for both hexb+/- and hexb-/- brain. It was also observed that there were distinct localizations for numerous other lipid subclasses; hence, imaging MALDI-MS could be used for \"lipidomic\" studies. These results illustrate the usefulness of tissue-imaging MALDI-MS with matrix deposition by OCN for histologic comparison of lipids in tissues such as brains from this mouse model of Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff disease."

The goal of this study was to develop a tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) method for the simultaneous measurement of both GM1 and GM2 gangliosides in human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples in order to be able to determine their concentrations in patients with Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff disease and assess whether drugs or transplantation affect their concentrations. An API-4000 tandem mass spectrometer equipped with TurboIonSpray source and Shimadzu HPLC system was employed to perform the analysis using isotope dilution with deuterium labeled internal standards. To a 1.5 mL conical plastic Eppendorf centrifuge tube, 40 microL of human CSF sample was added and mixed with 400 microL of internal standard solution for deproteinization. After centrifugation, 100 microL of supernatant was injected onto a C-18 column. After a 2.5 min wash, the switching valve was activated and the analytes were eluted from the column with a water/methanol gradient into the MS/MS system. Quantification by multiple reaction-monitoring (MRM) analysis was performed in the negative mode. The within-day coefficients of variation were <3% for GM1 and <2% for GM2 and the between-day coefficients of variation were <5% for both GM1 and GM2 at all concentrations tested. Accuracy ranged between 98% and 102% for both analytes. Good linearity was also obtained within the concentration range of 10-200 ng/mL (6.5-129.3 nmol/L) for GM1 and 5-100 ng/mL (3.6-72.3 nmol/L) for GM2 (r> or =0.995). A new simple, accurate, and fast isotope dilution tandem mass spectrometry method was developed for the simultaneous quantification of GM1 and GM2 gangliosides in a small amount of human CSF.

However, many of the couples first discover the possibility of genetic screening during pregnancy and efforts are made to bring couples to consider screening tests before the first pregnancy. In this context, high school offers a convenient setting and several pilot programs have been very successful. All evaluations of these programs found that education plays a critical role in allowing informed decisions and minimizing the possible harms. While it has been suggested that high school may be the best setting for reproductive screening programs, guidelines of several societies of human genetics recommend the use of carrier screening only in individuals older than 18 years. There are several other problems related to genetic screening programs at school and some are discussed in the review. Our opinion is that school should be a place to provide the tools for decisions by education only; while the option to have the genetic tests later in life or in another setting should be offered to the students as part of the education session. This may allow the students to decide when and where to have a genetic test."

    "abstract": "The prevalence and distribution of genetic diseases in the province of Quebec has been influenced by its population history. The current French Canadian population stems from 8,500 pioneers who left France for Nouvelle-France between 1608 and 1759. After the English conquest of Nouvelle-France in 1759, the French Canadian population remained mostly genetically isolated, for linguistic, cultural, and religious reasons. The migration of a small number of French individuals to Nouvelle-France created a founder effect. Subsequent migrations inland have created smaller regional founder effects. The limited size of the population favoured genetic drift, and the social context encouraged endogamy, i.e. unions between French Canadians with little admixture with English and other immigrants. Founder effects, genetic drift, and endogamy have all played a role in the current prevalence and distribution of genetic diseases now found in Quebec. The prevalence and distribution of genetic diseases in Quebec need to be taken into account in clinical practice. When clinicians are knowledgeable about the genetic diseases prevalent in the population they treat, they know to consider these diseases in differential diagnoses when appropriate and prioritize investigations accordingly. When developing a new diagnostic test for a genetic disease, the prevalence of the disease and the nature of the mutations found in the target population need to be taken into account. The performance of the test will depend on how well it accounts for the particularities of the disease in that population. In other words, how well does it detect the mutations found in that population? Interpretation of individual genetic test results will also depend on how well the test is expected to perform in the individual's population."

In most cases, these diseases are fatal, and until recently no treatment was available. Introduction of enzyme replacement therapy was a breakthrough in the treatment of some of the diseases. However, while this therapy is effective in reduction of many somatic symptoms, its efficacy in the treatment of the central nervous system is negligible, if any, mainly because of problems with crossing the blood-brain-barrier by intravenously administered enzyme molecules. On the other hand, there are many lysosomal storage diseases in which the central nervous system is affected. Results of very recent studies indicate that in at least some cases, another type of therapy, called substrate deprivation therapy (or substrate reduction therapy) may be effective in the treatment of neuronopathic forms of lysosomal storage diseases. This therapy, based on inhibition of synthesis of the compounds that cannot be degraded in cells of the patients, has been shown to be effective in several animal models of various diseases, and recent reports demonstrate its efficacy in the treatment of patients suffering from Niemann-Pick C disease and Sanfilippo disease."

Candidate diseases are those associated with a mutant protein that has difficulty folding and/or assembling into active oligomers in the endoplasmic reticulum. Many lysosomal storage diseases are candidates for enzyme enhancement therapy and have the additional advantage of requiring only 5-10% of normal enzyme levels to reduce and/or prevent substrate accumulation. Our long experience in working with the beta-hexosaminidase (EC 3.2.1.52) isozymes system and its associated deficiencies (Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff disease) lead us to search for possible enzyme enhancement therapy-agents that could treat the chronic forms of these diseases which express 2-5% residual activity. Pharmacological chaperones are enzyme enhancement therapy-agents that are competitive inhibitors of the target enzyme. Each of the known beta-hexosaminidase inhibitors (low microm IC50) increased mutant enzyme levels to >or= 10% in chronic Tay-Sachs fibroblasts and also attenuated the thermo-denaturation of beta-hexosaminidase. To expand the repertoire of pharmacological chaperones to more 'drug-like' compounds, we screened the Maybridge library of 50,000 compounds using a real-time assay for noncarbohydrate-based beta-hexosaminidase inhibitors and identified several that functioned as pharmacological chaperones in patient cells. Two of these inhibitors had derivatives that had been tested in humans for other purposes. These observations lead us to screen the NINDS library of 1040 Food and Drug Administration approved compounds for pharmacological chaperones. Pyrimethamine, an antimalarial drug with well documented pharmacokinetics, was confirmed as a beta-hexosaminidase pharmacological chaperone and compared favorably with our best carbohydrate-based pharmacological chaperone in patient cells with various mutant genotypes."

We have previously reported neuronal accumulation of both alpha- and beta-synucleins in brain tissue of a GM2 gangliosidosis mouse model. Although alpha-synuclein has been implicated in several neurodegenerative disorders including Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies and multiple system atrophy, its functions remain largely unclear. In our present study, we have examined a cohort of human lipidosis cases, including Sandhoff disease, Tay-Sachs disease, metachromatic leukodystrophy, beta-galactosialidosis and adrenoleukodystrophy, for the expression of alpha- and beta-synucleins and the associated lipid storage levels. The accumulation of alpha-synuclein was found in brain tissue in not only cases of lysosomal storage diseases, but also in instances of adrenoleukodystrophy, which is a peroxisomal disease. alpha-synuclein was detected in both neurons and glial cells of patients with these two disorders, although its distribution was found to be disease-dependent. In addition, alpha-synuclein-positive neurons were also found to be NeuN-positive, whereas NeuN-negative neurons did not show any accumulation of this protein. By comparison, the accumulation of beta-synuclein was detectable only in the pons of Sandhoff disease cases. This differential accumulation of alpha- and beta-synucleins in human lipidoses may be related to functional differences between these two proteins. In addition, the accumulation of alpha-synuclein may also be a condition that is common to lysosomal storage diseases and adrenoleukodystrophies that show an enhanced expression of this protein upon the elevation of stored lipids."

Two transferable embryos developed into blastocysts (wt/wt and wt GD/carrier TS) and both were transferred on day 5. This single cycle of PGD resulted in a healthy live child. Allele drop-out (ADO) was observed in three of 34 reactions, yielding an 8% ADO rate. The occurrence of ADO in single cell analysis and undetected recombination events are primary causes of misdiagnosis in PGD and emphasize the need to use multiple polymorphic markers.

In order to prepare a large amount of HexA for a treatment based on enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), recombinant HexA was produced in the methylotrophic yeast Ogataea minuta instead of in mammalian cells, which are commonly used to produce recombinant enzymes for ERT. The problem of antigenicity due to differences in N-glycan structures between mammalian and yeast glycoproteins was potentially resolved by using alpha-1,6-mannosyltransferase-deficient (och1Delta) yeast as the host. Genes encoding the alpha- and beta-subunits of HexA were integrated into the yeast cell, and the heterodimer was expressed together with its isozymes HexS (alphaalpha) and HexB (betabeta). A total of 57 mg of beta-hexosaminidase isozymes, of which 13 mg was HexA (alphabeta), was produced per liter of medium. HexA was purified with immobilized metal affinity column for the His tag attached to the beta-subunit. The purified HexA was treated with alpha-mannosidase to expose mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) residues on the N-glycans. The specific activities of HexA and M6P-exposed HexA (M6PHexA) for the artificial substrate 4MU-GlcNAc were 1.2 +/- 0.1 and 1.7 +/- 0.3 mmol/h/mg, respectively. The sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis pattern suggested a C-terminal truncation in the beta-subunit of the recombinant protein. M6PHexA was incorporated dose dependently into GM2 gangliosidosis patient-derived fibroblasts via M6P receptors on the cell surface, and degradation of accumulated GM2 ganglioside was observed."

    "abstract": "Here we describe a protocol for the amplified detection of a target DNA using a DNA/FokI-based replicating cutting machine. The protocol is based on the design of a sensing hairpin oligonucleotide that is opened upon hybridization with the analyte DNA. The endonuclease FokI binds to the double-stranded complex and cleaves it to a \"cutter\" unit. The \"cutter\" unit reacts with a fuel oligonucleotide to generate and amplify the signal. The fuel molecule is an oligonucleotide in a hairpin configuration with a fluorophore/quencher pair attached to the 5' and 3' ends. Formation of the duplex between the cutter and the fuel leads to the scission of the duplex by FokI, leading to a second, replicated \"cutter\", a fluorescent waste product, and to the regeneration of the original \"cutter\" unit. The autonomous replication of the \"cutter\" unit, as a result of the primary recognition of the analyte DNA, leads to the amplified fluorescent detection of the analyte DNA with a sensitivity limit of 1 x 10(-14) M. The operation of the machine and the sensing process are monitored by the fluorescence generated by the waste product. Here we apply the protocol, which takes about 2 h to complete, to analyze a Tay-Sachs genetic disorder mutant DNA."

    "abstract": "In the Ashkenazi Jewish population, serious and lethal genetic conditions occur with relatively high frequency. A single test that encompasses the majority of population-specific mutations is not currently available. For comprehensive carrier screening and molecular diagnostic purposes, we developed a population-specific and inclusive microarray. The arrayed primer extension genotyping microarray carries 59 sequence variant detection sites, of which 53 are detectable bi-directionally. These sites represent the most common variants in Tay-Sachs disease, Bloom syndrome, Canavan disease, Niemann-Pick A, familial dysautonomia, torsion dystonia, mucolipidosis type IV, Fanconi anemia, Gaucher disease, factor XI deficiency, glycogen storage disease type 1a, maple syrup urine disease, nonsyndromic sensorineural hearing loss, familial Mediterranean fever, and glycogen storage disease type III. Several mutations in the selected disorders that are not prevalent per se in the Ashkenazi Jewish populations, as well pseudodeficiency alleles, are also included in the array. The initial technical evaluation of this microarray demonstrates that it is comprehensive, robust, sensitive, specific, and easily modifiable. This cost-effective array is based on a diversely applied platform technology and is suitable for both carrier screening and disease detection in Ashkenazi and Sephardic Jewish populations."

Hexosaminidase isoenzymes were found in plasma membrane and cytosol and were composed of the same alpha- and beta-subunits as the lysosomal and plasma hexosaminidase A and B isoenzymes, though with some structural and kinetic differences. In addition, the cytosol contained a hexosaminidase that is a specific N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase, the one involved in the removal of N-acetylglucosamine residues O-linked to proteins, named O-GlcNAcase. This work provides an additional step in the characterization of hexosaminidases helping better understand their role in non-lysosomal compartments and their involvement in physiological or pathological situations."

Carbohydrate-based competitive inhibitors of Hex act as pharmacological chaperones (PC) in patient cells, facilitating exit of the enzyme from the endoplasmic reticulum, thereby increasing the mutant Hex protein and activity levels in the lysosome 3- to 6-fold. To identify drug-like PC candidates, we developed a fluorescence-based real-time enzyme assay and screened the Maybridge library of 50,000 compounds for inhibitors of purified Hex. Three structurally distinct micromolar competitive inhibitors, a bisnaphthalimide, nitro-indan-1-one, and pyrrolo[3,4-d]pyridazin-1-one were identified that specifically increased lysosomal Hex protein and activity levels in patient fibroblasts. These results validate screening for inhibitory compounds as an approach to identifying PCs."

    "abstract": "Prenatal screening for single gene disorders, which include over 10,000 diverse diseases, presents a great challenge. The major approach to identifying high-risk groups for diseases, from Tay Sachs Disease to sickle cell disease, has historically centered on ethnic-based screening. A major concern in an ethnic-based approach is that carriers belonging to less-traditionally considered populations will be missed. In the United States, the paradigm for a more modern pan-ethnic approach has become exemplified by cystic fibrosis (CF), although considerable debate about future directions remains. CF screening brings several additional issues to the forefront, including that the largest molecular prenatal genetic screening program is based on a single gene disorder that is not necessarily severely disabling. On the other hand, several devastating disorders where screening is indeed available remain relatively inaccessible to prenatal patients in the general population. Future candidates to consider for broad-based screening programs include spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), fragile X, and inborn errors of metabolism. As prenatal screening for single gene disorders expands, issues to consider include inclusion criteria and risk versus benefit."

    "abstract": "The assessment of risk for Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) in individuals of French Canadian background living in New England is an important health issue. In preliminary studies of the enzyme-defined carrier frequency for TSD among Franco-Americans in New England, we found frequencies (1:53) higher than predicted from the incidence of infantile TSD in this region. We have now further evaluated the risk for TSD in the Franco-American population of New England. Using a fluorescence-based assay for beta-hexosaminidase activity, we determined the carrier frequencies for TSD in 2783 Franco-Americans. DNA analysis was used to identify mutations causing enzyme deficiency in TSD carriers. We determined the enzyme-defined carrier frequency for TSD as 1:65 (95% confidence interval 1:49 to 1:90). DNA-based analysis of 24 of the enzyme-defined carriers revealed 21 with sequence changes: 9 disease-causing, 4 benign, and 8 of unknown significance. Six of the unknowns were identified as c.748G>A p.G250S, a mutation we show by expression analysis to behave similarly to the previously described c.805G>A p.G269S adult-onset TSD mutation. This putative adult-onset TSD c.748G>A p.G250S mutation has a population frequency similar to the common 7.6 kb deletion mutation that occurs in persons of French Canadian ancestry. We estimate the frequency of deleterious TSD alleles in Franco-Americans to be 1:73 (95% confidence interval 1:55 to 1:107). These data provide a more complete data base from which to formulate policy recommendations regarding TSD heterozygosity screening in individuals of French Canadian background."

    "abstract": "Late-onset GM2 gangliosidosis is composed of two related, autosomal recessive, neurodegenerative diseases, both resulting from deficiency of lysosomal, heterodimeric beta-hexosaminidase A (Hex A, alphabeta). Pharmacological chaperones (PC) are small molecules that can stabilize the conformation of a mutant protein, allowing it to pass the quality control system of the endoplasmic reticulum. To date all successful PCs have also been competitive inhibitors. Screening for Hex A inhibitors in a library of 1040 Food Drug Administration-approved compounds identified pyrimethamine (PYR (2,4-diamino 5-(4-chlorophenyl)-6-ethylpyrimidine)) as the most potent inhibitor. Cell lines from 10 late-onset Tay-Sachs (11 alpha-mutations, 2 novel) and 7 Sandhoff (9 beta-mutations, 4 novel) disease patients, were cultured with PYR at concentrations corresponding to therapeutic doses. Cells carrying the most common late-onset mutation, alphaG269S, showed significant increases in residual Hex A activity, as did all 7 of the beta-mutants tested. Cells responding to PC treatment included those carrying mutants resulting in reduced Hex heat stability and partial splice junction mutations of the inherently less stable alpha-subunit. PYR, which binds to the active site in domain II, was able to function as PC even to domain I beta-mutants. We concluded that PYR functions as a mutation-specific PC, variably enhancing residual lysosomal Hex A levels in late-onset GM2 gangliosidosis patient cells."

In this manuscript I examine the practice of providing carrier screening programs in the school setting. While the data show that high school screening programs can achieve high uptake, I argue that this may reflect a lack of full understanding about risks, benefits, and alternatives, and the right not to know. It may also reflect the inherent coercion in group testing, particularly for adolescents who are prone to peer pressure. The problem of carrier screening in the schools is compounded when the condition has a predilection for certain groups based on race, ethnicity or religion. I examine programs around the world that seek to test high school students for Tay Sachs and Cystic Fibrosis carrier status. I argue that carrier programs should be designed so as to minimize stigma and to allow individuals to refuse. The mandatory school environment cannot achieve this. Rather, I conclude that screening programs should be designed to attract young adults and not adolescents to participate in a more voluntary venue."

    "abstract": "In conventional PCR, total amplicon yield becomes independent of starting template number as amplification reaches plateau and varies significantly among replicate reactions. This paper describes a strategy for reconfiguring PCR so that the signal intensity of a single fluorescent detection probe after PCR thermal cycling reflects genomic composition. The resulting method corrects for product yield variations among replicate amplification reactions, permits resolution of homozygous and heterozygous genotypes based on endpoint fluorescence signal intensities, and readily identifies imbalanced allele ratios equivalent to those arising from gene/chromosomal duplications. Furthermore, the use of only a single colored probe for genotyping enhances the multiplex detection capacity of the assay. Two-Temperature LATE-PCR endpoint genotyping combines Linear-After-The-Exponential (LATE)-PCR (an advanced form of asymmetric PCR that efficiently generates single-stranded DNA) and mismatch-tolerant probes capable of detecting allele-specific targets at high temperature and total single-stranded amplicons at a lower temperature in the same reaction. The method is demonstrated here for genotyping single-nucleotide alleles of the human HEXA gene responsible for Tay-Sachs disease and for genotyping SNP alleles near the human p53 tumor suppressor gene. In each case, the final probe signals were normalized against total single-stranded DNA generated in the same reaction. Normalization reduces the coefficient of variation among replicates from 17.22% to as little as 2.78% and permits endpoint genotyping with >99.7% accuracy. These assays are robust because they are consistent over a wide range of input DNA concentrations and give the same results regardless of how many cycles of linear amplification have elapsed. The method is also sufficiently powerful to distinguish between samples with a 1:1 ratio of two alleles from samples comprised of 2:1 and 1:2 ratios of the same alleles. SNP genotyping via Two-Temperature LATE-PCR takes place in a homogeneous closed-tube format and uses a single hybridization probe per SNP site. These assays are convenient, rely on endpoint analysis, improve the options for construction of multiplex assays, and are suitable for SNP genotyping, mutation scanning, and detection of DNA duplication or deletions."

The purpose of this study was to delineate the natural history of the condition and identify genotype-phenotype correlations that might be helpful in predicting the course of the disease in individual patients. A cohort of 21 patients with juvenile GM2 gangliosidosis, 15 with the Tay-Sachs variant and 6 with the Sandhoff variant, was studied prospectively in 2 centers. Our experience was compared with previously published reports on 134 patients. Information about clinical features, beta-hexosaminidase enzyme activity, and mutation analysis was collected. In our cohort of patients, the mean (+/-SD) age of onset of symptoms was 5.3 +/- 4.1 years, with a mean follow-up time of 8.4 years. The most common symptoms at onset were gait disturbances (66.7%), incoordination (52.4%), speech problems (28.6%), and developmental delay (28.6%). The age of onset of gait disturbances was 7.1 +/- 5.6 years. The mean time for progression to becoming wheelchair-bound was 6.2 +/- 5.5 years. The mean age of onset of speech problems was 7.0 +/- 5.6 years, with a mean time of progression to anarthria of 5.6 +/- 5.3 years. Muscle wasting (10.6 +/- 7.4 years), proximal weakness (11.1 +/- 7.7 years), and incontinence of sphincters (14.6 +/- 9.7 years) appeared later in the course of the disease. Psychiatric disturbances and neuropathy were more prevalent in patients with the Sandhoff variant than in those with the Tay-Sachs variant. However, dysphagia, sphincter incontinence, and sleep problems occurred earlier in those with the Tay-Sachs variant. Cerebellar atrophy was the most common finding on brain MRI (52.9%). The median survival time among the studied and reviewed patients was 14.5 years. The genotype-phenotype correlation revealed that in patients with the Tay-Sachs variant, the presence of R178H and R499H mutations was predictive of an early onset and rapidly progressive course. The presence of either G269S or W474C mutations was associated with a later onset of symptoms along with a more slowly progressive disease course. Juvenile GM2 gangliosidosis is clinically heterogeneous, not only in terms of age of onset and clinical features but also with regard to the course of the disease. In general, the earlier the onset of symptoms, the more rapidly the disease progresses. The Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff variants differed somewhat in the frequency of specific clinical characteristics. Speech deterioration progressed more rapidly than gait abnormalities in both the Tay-Sachs variant and Sandhoff variant groups. Among patients with the Tay-Sachs variant, the HEXA genotype showed a significant correlation with the clinical course."

Three patients were affected by the B1 subacute variant and were shown to carry the R178H mutation (the DN allele), which is also common among Portuguese patients. Two of them were compound heterozygotes, whereas the third presented with the mutation in both alleles. Since Brazil was a Portuguese colony for over two centuries, common ancestry might be the probable explanation. The fourth patient presented with a juvenile phenotype and carries the R499H mutation, which has been reported only once worldwide and is associated with residual enzyme activity, responsible for a slower clinical course. The fifth family, of an Ashkenazi Jewish background, showed an extensive intrafamilial clinical variability among three affected sibs presenting with muscle atrophy, ataxia, and psychiatric symptoms. They were first diagnosed as having atypical spinal muscular atrophy and, subsequently, spinocerebellar ataxia, but, recently, the diagnosis of late-onset Tay-Sachs disease was confirmed based on reduced plasma hexosaminidase A activity and the G269S/InsTATC1278 genotype. It is therefore highly recommended to test patients with a similar clinical history for Tay-Sachs disease. In the same family, one first cousin committed suicide at the age of 24 years, presenting with a clinical phenotype that suggested an undiagnosed case and highlighting the effect of the intrafamilial clinical variability in delaying a prompt diagnosis. It is now recognized that his parents are, in fact, a carrier couple. Additionally, another relative had been previously identified as a heterozygote in a Tay-Sachs disease screening program, but the information was not shared among the family. Since this information might anticipate diagnosis and genetic counseling, it is advisable that heterozygote screening programs encourage families to share genetic information."

We have developed a multiplexed genetic assay for eight diseases prevalent in the Ashkenazi population: Tay-Sachs, Gaucher type I, Niemann-Pick types A and B, mucolipidosis type IV, familial dysautonomia, Canavan, Bloom syndrome, and Fanconi anemia type C. This assay includes an allelic determination for GBA allele c.1448T>C (L444P). The goal of this study was to clinically evaluate this assay. Biotinylated, multiplex PCR products were directly hybridized to capture probes immobilized on fluorescently addressed microspheres. After incubation with streptavidin-conjugated fluorophore, the reactions were analyzed by Luminex IS100. Clinical evaluations were conducted using de-identified patient DNA samples. We evaluated a multiplexed suspension array assay that includes wild-type and mutant genetic determinations for Gaucher disease allele c.1448T>C. Two percent of samples reported to be wild-type by conventional methods were observed to be c.1448T>C heterozygous using our assay. Sequence analysis suggested that this phenomenon was due to co-amplification of the functional gene and a paralogous pseudogene (PsiGBA) due to a polymorphism in the primer-binding site of the latter. Primers for the amplification of this allele were then repositioned to span an upstream deletion in the pseudogene, yielding a much longer amplicon. Although it is widely reported that long amplicons negatively impact amplification or detection efficiency in recently adopted multiplex techniques, this assay design functioned properly and resolved the occurrence of false heterozygosity. Although previously available sequence information suggested GBA gene/pseudogene discrimination capabilities with a short amplified product, we identified common single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the pseudogene that required amplification of a larger region for effective discrimination."

Tay-Sachs-related diseases (GM2 gangliosidoses) are incurable, but gene therapy has the potential for widespread correction of the underlying lysosomal defect by means of the secretion-recapture cellular pathway for enzymatic complementation. Sandhoff mice, lacking the beta-subunit of hexosaminidase, manifest many signs of classical human Tay-Sachs disease and, with an acute course, die before 20 weeks of age. We treated Sandhoff mice by stereotaxic intracranial inoculation of recombinant adeno-associated viral vectors encoding the complementing human beta-hexosaminidase alpha and beta subunit genes and elements, including an HIV tat sequence, to enhance protein expression and distribution. Animals survived for >1 year with sustained, widespread, and abundant enzyme delivery in the nervous system. Onset of the disease was delayed with preservation of motor function; inflammation and GM2 ganglioside storage in the brain and spinal cord was reduced.

Effective enzyme replacement therapy of type I Gaucher disease, based on chronic intravenous administration of mannose-terminated recombinant human glucocerebrosidase, has been available since 1990 and has been applied in several thousand patients without serious adverse effects. An alternative therapeutic approach, so-called substrate reduction therapy, is based on partial reduction of the synthesis of glucosylceramide and hence of subsequent metabolites. Oral administration of an inhibitor of glucosylceramide synthesis (N-butyldeoxynojirimycin, registered in Europe since 2002 as miglustat (Zavesca)), is effective in reversing clinical symptoms in type I Gaucher patients with mild to moderate disease manifestations. The growing long-term experience with substrate reduction therapy indicates that this treatment is also without major adverse effects. Substrate reduction therapy, in conjunction with enzyme replacement therapy, may play an important role in the future clinical management of patients suffering from type I Gaucher disease. Clinical trials are under way that should reveal the value of substrate reduction for maintenance therapy of type I Gaucher disease and for treatment of neuronopathic variants of Gaucher disease, Niemann-Pick disease type C, late-onset Tay-Sachs disease and Sandhoff disease."

NGT, a mechanism-based inhibitor, has been shown to act as a chemical chaperone that, to some extent, prevents misfolding of a Hex A mutant associated with adult onset Tay Sachs disease and, as a result, increases the residual activity of Hex A to a level above the critical threshold for disease. The crystal structure of Hex A reveals an alphabeta heterodimer, with each subunit having a functional active site. Only the alpha-subunit active site can hydrolyze GM2 gangliosides due to a flexible loop structure that is removed post-translationally from beta, and to the presence of alphaAsn423 and alphaArg424. The loop structure is involved in binding the GM2 activator protein, while alphaArg424 is critical for binding the carboxylate group of the N-acetyl-neuraminic acid residue of GM2. The beta-subunit lacks these key residues and has betaAsp452 and betaLeu453 in their place; the beta-subunit therefore cleaves only neutral substrates efficiently. Mutations in the alpha-subunit, associated with TSD, and those in the beta-subunit, associated with SD are discussed. The effect of NGT binding in the active site of a mutant Hex A and its effect on protein function is discussed."

    "abstract": "Lipocalin-type prostaglandin (PG) D synthase (L-PGDS) is a dually functional protein, acting both as a PGD2-synthesizing enzyme and as an extracellular transporter of various lipophilic small molecules. L-PGDS is expressed in oligodendrocytes (OLs) in the central nervous system and is up-regulated in OLs of the twitcher mouse, a model of globoid cell leukodystrophy (Krabbe's disease). We investigated whether up-regulation of L-PGDS is either unique to Krabbe's disease or is a more generalized phenomenon in lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs), using LSD mouse models of Tay-Sachs disease, Sandhoff disease, GM1 gangliosidosis and Niemann-Pick type C1 disease. Quantitative RT-PCR revealed that L-PGDS mRNA was up-regulated in the brains of all these mouse models. In addition, strong L-PGDS immunoreactivity was observed in OLs, but not in either astrocytes or microglia in these models. Thus, up-regulation of L-PGDS appears to be a common response of OLs in LSDs. Moreover, surface plasmon resonance analyses revealed that L-PGDS binds GM1 and GM2 gangliosides, accumulated in neurons in the course of LSD, with high affinities (KD = 65 and 210 nm, respectively). This suggests that L-PGDS may play a role in scavenging harmful lipophilic substrates in LSD."

    "abstract": "Autosomal recessive diseases with mental retardation are disorders that affect autosomes, and their genetic expression occurs in individuals who are homozygotic for a mutation, while heterozygotic subjects are unaffected carriers. If both parents are carriers, the theoretical possibility of their children also being carriers is 50%, the risk of the children being affected by the disease is 25%, and there is a 25% chance of their being healthy. They are an important source of mental deficiencies and inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) are some of their characteristic syndromes. The genetic disorders known as IEM can be classified according to the metabolism they affect, that is, purines, pyrimidines, amino acids, and so on. One of the lysosomal disorders is Tay-Sachs disease, which is rare among the general population but is very frequent in populations with a high rate of consanguinity, such as the Ashkenazi Jews. One of the most notable disorders affecting the metabolism of amino acids is the case of phenylketonuria due to mutations in the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene (PAH). It accounts for 0.5-1% of mental diseases and appears with a frequency rate of between 1/11,500 and 1/14,000 in newborn infants. Its early diagnosis through neonatal screening programmes makes it possible to start administering a phenylalanine-free diet and thus prevent mental retardation. Knowledge of this kind of autosomal diseases with neurological involvement, together with their correct and early diagnosis, makes it possible to establish suitable treatment regimens in some cases and to carry out genetic counselling in all of them."

Patients with mucopolysaccharidoses I to III, mucolipidoses (ML) II (n = 36), adrenoleukodystrophy (n = 8), metachromatic leukodystrophy (n = 6), Krabbe disease (n = 16), and Tay-Sachs disease (n = 3) were enrolled between August 1999 and June 2004. All patients received the same preparative regimen, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis, and supportive care. End points included survival, engraftment, GVHD, and toxicity. Sixty-nine patients (64% men; 81% white) with a median age of 1.8 years underwent transplantation with a median cell dose of 8.7 x 10(7)/kg. One-year survival was 72% (95% confidence interval, 61%-83%). The cumulative incidence of neutrophil engraftment by day 42 was 78% (95% confidence interval, 67%-87%) at a median of 25 days. Grade II to IV acute GVHD occurred in 36% of patients. Cord blood donors are readily available for rapid transplantation. Cord blood transplantation should be considered as frontline therapy for young patients with lysosomal and peroxisomal storage diseases."

Both their serum HexA and HexB enzymatic activities were below reference range, suggesting inheritance of mutations in both the HEXA (alpha-subunit) and HEXB (beta-subunit) genes. DNA sequencing revealed that both individuals, carried the common HEXA 1277_1278insTATC mutation, and two common HEXB polymorphisms: [619A>G (+) delTG]. To determine if these HEXB polymorphisms reduce HexA and HexB enzymatic activities, 69 DNA samples from subjects previously screened enzymatically in both serum and leukocytes for TSD carrier status were selected for either high, mid-range or low serum Total Hex (defined as the sum of HexA and HexB) activities and were tested for the HEXB mutations. Further, three additional TSD carriers ascertained by the atypical pattern of normal serum %HexA but carrier leukocyte %HexA, were found to have the [delTG (+) 619A>G] genotype. In addition, the frequency of the [delTG (+) 619A>G] genotype was significantly higher (P < 0.01) in subjects with low serum HexB enzymatic activities. Given the high frequency of the [delTG (+) 619A>G] haplotype in the Ashkenazi Jewish population (approximately 10%), up to 10% of TSD carriers may have normal serum %HexA values with low total Hex. Accordingly, serum %HexA should not be the sole criterion used for carrier status determination. Where total Hex activity is reduced, further testing with leukocyte Hex profiles is indicated."

    "abstract": "Tay Sachs disease carrier screening programs have been offered successfully worldwide since 1970. The programs typically offer education, testing, and counseling to provide reproductive choices. One such program has been offered to Jewish school students in Melbourne since 1998. In a time of increasing public awareness of genetics, programs require continuous evaluation and updating. Over 2 successive years, a longitudinal evaluation involved students attending Jewish schools in Melbourne. Both qualitative and quantitative techniques were used to analyze alternative methods for education and sampling procedures. Comparisons involved (1) a computer-based resource versus an oral educational presentation and (2) blood sampling for enzyme and genetic testing versus cheekbrush testing for genetic sampling alone. The education session was effective in significantly increasing students' knowledge (10.5% +/- 1.2%, P < .0001) and decreasing their anxiety about being a carrier (-12.2% +/- 1.6%, P < .0001). For the students, no significant differences were found between the computer-based resource and oral presentation. There were significantly more students accepting a carrier test and anxiety was lower when a cheekbrush test was offered compared with when a blood test was offered. Computer-based instruction is equally effective, in addition to offering advantages of self-paced learning and minimization of human resources as an oral presentation within a genetic carrier screening program. Cheekbrush sampling is preferred to blood sampling and should be implemented into current practices for offering genetic screening programs. These results present alternatives to practices for genetic screening reflecting the current developing technology."

Both her mother and sister suffered from attacks of hemiplegic migraine, mild mental retardation, and cerebellar ataxia. Neuropathological examinations revealed acute changes in the widespread cerebral cortex, chronic degenerative changes in the anterior lobe of the cerebellar vermis, axonal spheroids in the Goll's nucleus, pseudo-calcinosis in the globus pallidus, and glial bundles in the cranial nerves. The most fascinating features were changes of Purkinje cells, such as cactuses (asteroid bodies, dendritic expansions), somatic sprouts, and torpedoes. These changes may be characteristic of familial hemiplegic migraine with cerebellar atrophy, as well as the other metabolic diseases, such as Menkes' kinky hair disease, infantile (Tay-Sachs type) amaurotic idiocy, organic mercury intoxication, and mitochondrial encephalopathy, of which cases often exhibit such pathological changes of Purkinje cells.

A variety of prominent visceral and skeletal defects are characteristic, but primary neurological involvement has generally been considered absent. We report here that the feline model of MPS VI exhibits abnormal lysosomal storage in occasional neurones and glia distributed throughout the cerebral cortex. Abnormal lysosomal inclusions were pleiomorphic with some resembling zebra bodies and dense core inclusions typical of other MPS diseases or the membranous storage bodies characteristic of the gangliosidoses. Pyramidal neurones were shown to contain abnormal amounts of GM2 and GM3 gangliosides by immunocytochemical staining and unesterified cholesterol by histochemical (filipin) staining. Further, Golgi staining of pyramidal neurones revealed that some possessed ectopic axon hillock neurites and meganeurites similar to those described in Tay-Sachs and other neuronal storage diseases with ganglioside storage. Some animals evaluated in this study also received allogeneic bone marrow transplants, but no significant differences in neuronal storage were noted between treated and untreated individuals. These studies demonstrate that deficiency of 4S activity can lead to metabolic abnormalities in the neurones of central nervous system in cats, and that these changes may not be readily amenable to correction by bone marrow transplantation. Given the close pathological and biochemical similarities between feline and human MPS VI, it is conceivable that children with this disease have similar neuronal involvement."

    "abstract": "The ganglioside-activator protein is an essential cofactor for the lysosomal degradation of ganglioside GM2 (GM2) by beta-hexosaminidase A. It mediates the interaction between the water-soluble exohydrolase and its membrane-embedded glycolipid substrate at the lipid-water interphase. Mutations in the gene encoding this glycoprotein result in a fatal neurological storage disorder, the AB variant of GM2-gangliosidosis. In order to efficiently and sensitively probe the glycolipid binding and membrane activity of this cofactor, we synthesized two new fluorescent glycosphingolipid (GSL) probes, 2-NBD-GM1 and 2-NBD-GM2. Both compounds were synthesized in a convergent and multistep synthesis starting from the respective gangliosides isolated from natural sources. The added functionality of 2-aminogangliosides allowed us to introduce the chromophore into the region between the polar head group and the hydrophobic anchor of the lipid. Both fluorescent glycolipids exhibited an extremely low off-rate in model membranes and displayed very efficient resonance energy transfer to rhodamine-dioleoyl phosphoglycerol ethanolamine (rhodamine-PE) as acceptor. The binding to GM2-activator protein (GM2AP) and the degrading enzyme was shown to be unaltered compared to their natural analogues. A novel fluorescence-resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay was developed to monitor in real time the protein-mediated intervesicular transfer of these lipids from donor to acceptor liposomes. The data obtained indicate that this rapid and robust system presented here should serve as a valuable tool to probe quantitatively and comprehensively the membrane activity of GM2AP and other sphingolipid activator proteins and facilitate further structure-function studies aimed at delineating independently the lipid- and the enzyme-binding mode of these essential cofactors."

The major aim of our study was the evaluation of this hypothesis. Total Hex and its Hex A and Hex B isoenzymes were determined in different samples of serum and plasma (n = 81) as well as in lysates of platelets (n = 75), and mononuclear (n = 81), polymorphonuclear (n = 81) and mixed total leukocytes (n = 33).

Although the relative proportion of Hex A was significantly greater in polymorphonuclear than in mononuclear leukocytes (P < 0.001), a statistical significance was not attained for the correlation between the relative proportions of blood polymorphonuclear cells and Hex A in mixed total leukocytes (r = 0.220).

    "abstract": "Lysosomal storage diseases are clinically heterogeneous with respect to their age of onset, progression of symptoms and the particular organs involved. Varying levels of residual enzyme activity, associated with different defective alleles that cause the respective diseases, are responsible in part for this clinical heterogeneity. In general, the higher the residual enzyme activity, the milder the phenotype. Enzyme activity in severe forms of disease is frequently zero, and in mild forms usually does not exceed approximately 5%. However, the correlation is not so strict as to allow prediction of the phenotype of individual patients. The molecular basis of the different levels of enzyme activity can only be revealed by biochemical investigations of the defective lysosomal proteins. Null alleles may be due to splice-site mutations or deletions. In the case of missense mutations, enzymes frequently fold incorrectly and are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and subsequently degraded. As these enzymes do not reach the lysosome, they do not provide any functional residual activity. Residual enzyme activity is only observed in cases where the defective enzyme reaches the lysosome and has retained enzymatic activity. Patients carrying the same mutant alleles still show considerable phenotypic variability due to modifying genes and epigenetic factors. None of these has so far been elucidated. However, there are some indications that differences in splicing-factor machinery may influence the phenotypic expression of splice-site mutations and that hormonal modulation of secondary microglial activation in lipidosis may also influence the disease course. Phenotypic variability is a frequent phenomenon in lysosomal storage diseases. Residual enzyme activity has been identified as one of the factors influencing the clinical outcome of disease; however, it is obvious that other genetic and epigenetic factors also affect phenotypic variability, particularly in patients with late onset disease."

    "title": "Evolutionary explanations in medical and health profession courses: are you answering your students' \"why\" questions?",
    "abstract": "Medical and pre-professional health students ask questions about human health that can be answered in two ways, by giving proximate and evolutionary explanations. Proximate explanations, most common in textbooks and classes, describe the immediate scientifically known biological mechanisms of anatomical characteristics or physiological processes. These explanations are necessary but insufficient. They can be complemented with evolutionary explanations that describe the evolutionary processes and principles that have resulted in human biology we study today. The main goal of the science of Darwinian Medicine is to investigate human disease, disorders, and medical complications from an evolutionary perspective. This paper contrasts the differences between these two types of explanations by describing principles of natural selection that underlie medical questions. Thus, why is human birth complicated? Why does sickle cell anemia exist? Why do we show symptoms like fever, diarrhea, and coughing when we have infection? Why do we suffer from ubiquitous age-related diseases like arteriosclerosis, Alzheimer's and others? Why are chronic diseases like type II diabetes and obesity so prevalent in modern society? Why hasn't natural selection eliminated the genes that cause common genetic diseases like hemochromatosis, cystic fibrosis, Tay sachs, PKU and others? In giving students evolutionary explanations professors should underscore principles of natural selection, since these can be generalized for the analysis of many medical questions. From a research perspective, natural selection seems central to leading hypotheses of obesity and type II diabetes and might very well explain the occurrence of certain common genetic diseases like cystic fibrosis, hemochromatosis, Tay sachs, Fragile X syndrome, G6PD and others because of their compensating advantages. Furthermore, armed with evolutionary explanations, health care professionals can bring practical benefits to patients by treating their symptoms of infection more specifically and judiciously. They might also help curtail the evolutionary arms race between pathogens and antibiotic defenses."

    "abstract": "A novel enzyme which may be important in mucin degradation has been discovered in the mucin-utilizing anaerobe Prevotella strain RS2. This enzyme cleaves terminal 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-beta-D-glucopyranoside 6-sulfate (6-SO3-GlcNAc) residues from sulfomucin and from the model substrate 4-nitrophenyl 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-beta-D-glucopyranoside 6-sodium sulfate. The existence of this mucin-desulfating glycosidase (sulfoglycosidase) suggests an alternative mechanism by which this bacterium may desulfate sulfomucins, by glycosidic removal of a sulfated sugar from mucin oligosaccharide chains. Previously, mucin desulfation was thought to take place by the action of a specific desulfating enzyme, which then allowed glycosidases to remove desulfated sugar. Sulfate removal from sulfomucins is thought to be a rate-limiting step in mucin degradation by bacteria in the regions of the digestive tract with a significant bacterial flora. The sulfoglycosidase was induced by growth of the Prevotella strain on mucin and was purified 284-fold from periplasmic extracts. Tryptic digestion and sequencing of peptides from the 100-kDa protein enabled the sulfoglycosidase gene to be cloned and sequenced. Active recombinant enzyme was made in an Escherichia coli expression system. The sulfoglycosidase shows sequence similarity to hexosaminidases. The only other enzyme that has been shown to remove 6-SO3-GlcNAc from glycoside substrates is the human lysosomal enzyme beta-N-acetylhexosaminidase A, point mutations in which cause the inheritable, lysosomal storage disorder Tay-Sachs disease. The human enzyme removes GlcNAc from glycoside substrates also, in contrast to the Prevotella enzyme, which acts on a nonsulfated substrate at a rate that is only 1% of the rate observed with a sulfated substrate."

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to describe the phenotype (and corresponding genotype) of adult patients with late-onset Tay-Sachs disease, a clinical variant of the GM2-gangliosidoses. A comprehensive physical examination, including neurological assessments, was performed to establish the current disease pattern and severity. In addition, the patients' past medical histories were reviewed. The patients' alpha-subunit mutations (beta-Hexosaminidase A genotype) were determined and correlated with their corresponding clinical findings and disease course. Twenty-one patients (current mean age: 27.0 years; range: 14-47 years) were identified. The pedigree revealed a relative with the \"classic\" infantile or late-onset form of Tay-Sachs disease in four (out of 18) unrelated families. The patients were predominantly male (15/21 individuals) and of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry (15/18 families). Mean age at onset was 18.1 years; balance problems and difficulty climbing stairs were the most frequent presenting complaints. In several cases, the diagnosis was delayed (mean age at diagnosis: 27.0 years). Analysis of the beta-hex A gene revealed the G269S mutation as the most common disease allele; found in homozygosity (N = 1) or heterozygosity (N = 18; including 2 sib pairs). Disease onset (age 36 years) was delayed and progression relatively slower in the homozygous G269S patient. Two siblings (ages 28 and 31 years), of non-Jewish ancestry, were compound heterozygotes (TATC1278/W474C); their clinical course is dominated by psychiatric problems. Brain imaging studies revealed marked cerebellar atrophy in all patients (N = 18) tested, regardless of disease stage. Late-onset Tay-Sachs disease is an infrequent disorder and the diagnosis is often missed or delayed (by approximately 8 years). Early on, the majority of patients develop signs of either cerebellar or anterior motor neuron involvement. Affected individuals may also develop psychotic episodes. In most cases, the later-onset of expression results from the presence of at least one allele (usually the G269S mutation), associated with residual enzyme (beta-hexosaminidase A) activity. A positive family history is a valuable clue, enabling early diagnosis. Nonspecific cerebellar atrophy on brain imaging is another important finding. This entity should be considered among patients presenting with speech, gait, and balance problems, and those with psychiatric disorders even when focal neurologic deficits may be initially absent. Accurate diagnosis will permit appropriate genetic counseling regarding disease prognosis and reproductive risks."

    "abstract": "Brain inflammation in GM2 gangliosidosis has been recently realized as a key factor in disease development. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a FIV beta-hexosaminidase vector in the brain of HexB-deficient (Sandhoff disease) mice following intraperitoneal administration to pups of neonatal age. Since brain inflammation, lysosomal storage and neuromuscular dysfunction are characteristics of HexB deficiency, these parameters were employed as experimental outcomes in our study. The ability of the lentiviral vector FIV(HEX) to infect murine cells was initially demonstrated with success in normal mouse fibroblasts and human Tay-Sachs cells in vitro. Furthermore, systemic transfer of FIV(HEX) to P2 HexB-/- knockout pups lead to transduction of peripheral and central nervous system tissues. Specifically, beta-hexosaminidase expressing cells were immunolocalized in periventricular areas of the cerebrum as well as in the cerebellar cortex. FIV(HEX) neonatal treatment resulted in reduction of GM2 storage along with attenuation of the brain inflammation and amelioration of the attendant neuromuscular deterioration. In conclusion, these results demonstrate the effective transfer of a beta-hexosaminidase lentiviral vector to the brain of Sandhoff mice and resolution of the GM2 gangliosidosis after neonatal intraperitoneal administration."

    "abstract": "With increasing concerns regarding rapidly expanding health care costs, cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) provides a methodology to assess whether marginal gains from new technology are worth the increased costs. In the arena of prenatal diagnosis, particular methodological and ethical concerns include whether the effects of such testing on individuals other than the patient are included, how termination of pregnancy is included in the models, redundancy of screening and diagnostic methods, and how screening may reassure or cause anxiety in patients depending on their results. The existing literature has demonstrated cost-effectiveness of screening and diagnosis of neural tube defects, Down syndrome, and cystic fibrosis in the general population. Screening for genetic disorders which have a higher prevalence among particular groups has also been shown to be cost effective, including diseases such as hemoglobinopathies and Tay-Sachs disease. Understanding the methodology and salient issues of CEA is critical for researchers, editors and clinicians to accurately interpret results of the growing body of cost-effectiveness studies in prenatal diagnosis."

    "abstract": "Although the first description of a lysosomal storage disorder was that of Tay-Sachs disease in 1881, the lysosome was not discovered until 1955, by Christian De Duve. The first demonstration by Hers in 1963 of a link between an enzyme deficiency and a storage disorder (Pompe's disease) paved the way for a series of seminal discoveries about the intracellular biology of these enzymes and their substrates, culminating in the successful treatment of Gaucher's disease with beta-glucosidase in the early 1990s. It is now recognized that these disorders are not simply a consequence of pure storage, but result from perturbation of complex cell signalling mechanisms. These in turn give rise to secondary structural and biochemical changes, which have important implications for therapy. Significant challenges remain, particularly the treatment of central nervous system disease. It is hoped that recent advances in our understanding of lysosomal biology will enable successful therapies to be developed."

Review of literature from professional journals, professional organizations' Web sites, guidelines from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the National Institute of Health Consensus Statement, and the authors' professional clinical experience. The goal of preconception counseling is to identify potential or actual medical, psychological, or social conditions that may affect the mother or fetus. NPs are often the health care providers that initiate preconception counseling to women in varied primary care settings. NPs must be familiar with ethnicity-related inheritable conditions in order to provide appropriate client information and education and to implement testing and, when needed, referral for genetic counseling to individuals and families at risk for genetic disorders such as Tay-Sachs, Canavan's disease, CF, sickle cell anemia, and thalassemia. NPs providing health care to women of child-bearing age should assess the client's use of contraception and intent for future pregnancy. Preconception counseling when indicated should be initiated to all women to increase their potential for healthy pregnancy outcomes. Although a comprehensive personal, family, medical, and psychosocial history and initiation of folic acid are the mainstays of preconception counseling, assessment for risk of ethnicity-related genetic conditions must also be included in prepregnancy health care."

It is caused by the accumulation of glucosylceramide (glucocerebroside) due to deficient activity of the enzyme glucosylceramide-beta-glucosidase (glucocerebrosidase). As with other glycosphingolipidoses, severe neurodegeneration is present in types 2 and 3 Gaucher disease. We have used Serial Analysis of Gene Expression (SAGE) to characterize the gene expression profiles in brain of patients with glycosphingolipid storage diseases to understand the molecular details of neurodegeneration. In the current study we have determined the gene expression profile from the brain of a patient with type 2 Gaucher disease, the acute neuronopathic form of the disorder. We found that the expression profile of the type 2 Gaucher brain is significantly altered relative to the normal control brain profile. There were also differences when compared with profiles from Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff patients, in particular in levels of genes related to macrophage activation. Intriguingly we found that gamma-synuclein, a family member of proteins involved the pathogenesis of other neurodegenerative disorders, was elevated in the one Gaucher type 2 patient brain we examined."

To determine the range of visual and ocular motor abnormalities in LOTS, as a prelude to evaluating the effectiveness of novel therapies. Fourteen patients with biochemically confirmed LOTS (8 men; age range 24 to 53 years; disease duration 5 to 30 years) and 10 age-matched control subjects were studied. Snellen visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, color vision, stereopsis, and visual fields were measured, and optic fundi were photographed. Horizontal and vertical eye movements (search coil) were recorded, and saccades, pursuit, vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR), vergence, and optokinetic (OK) responses were measured. All patients showed normal visual functions and optic fundi. The main eye movement abnormality concerned saccades, which were \"multistep,\" consisting of a series of small saccades and larger movements that showed transient decelerations. Larger saccades ended earlier and more abruptly (greater peak deceleration) in LOTS patients than in control subjects; these changes can be attributed to premature termination of the saccadic pulse. Smooth-pursuit and slow-phase OK gains were reduced, but VOR, vergence, and gaze holding were normal. Patients with late-onset Tay-Sachs disease (LOTS) show characteristic abnormalities of saccades but normal afferent visual systems. Hypometria, transient decelerations, and premature termination of saccades suggest disruption of a \"latch circuit\" that normally inhibits pontine omnipause neurons, permitting burst neurons to discharge until the eye movement is completed. These measurable abnormalities of saccades provide a means to evaluate the effects of novel treatments for LOTS."

    "abstract": "GM(2) gangliosidoses are a group of panethnic lysosomal storage diseases in which GM(2) ganglioside accumulates in the lysosome due to a defect in one of three genes, two of which encode the alpha- or beta-subunits of beta- N -acetylhexosaminidase (Hex) A. A small inframe deletion mutation in the catalytic domain of the alpha-subunit of Hex has been found in five Turkish patients with infantile Tay-Sachs disease. To date it has not been detected in other populations and is the only mutation to be found in exon 10. It results in detectable levels of inactive alpha-protein in its precursor form. Because the alpha- and beta-subunits share 60% sequence identity, the Hex A and Hex B genes are believed to have arisen from a common ancestral gene. Thus the subunits must share very similar three-dimensional structures with conserved functional domains. Hex B, the beta-subunit homodimer is more stable than the heterodimeric Hex A, and much more stable than Hex S, the alpha homodimer. Thus, mutations that completely destabilize the alpha-subunit can often be partially rescued if expressed in the aligned positions in the beta-subunit. To better understand the severity of the Turkish HEXA mutation, we reproduced the 12 bp deletion mutation (1267-1278) in the beta-subunit cDNA. Western blot analysis of permanently transfected CHO cells expressing the mutant detected only the pro-form of the beta-subunit coupled with a total lack of detectable Hex B activity. These data indicate that the deletion of the four amino acids severely affects the folding of even the more stable beta-subunit, causing its retention in the endoplasmic reticulum and ultimate degradation."

A retrospective analysis was conducted of Guthrie cards that were collected from newborns in Denmark during the period 1982-1997. Patients whose lysosomal storage disorder (LSD; 47 representing 12 disorders) was diagnosed in Denmark during the period 1982-1997 were selected, and their Guthrie cards were retrieved from storage. Control cards (227) were retrieved from the same period. Additional control cards (273) were collected from the South Australian Screening Centre (Australia). From 2 protein and 94 metabolite markers, 15 were selected and evaluated for their use in the identification of LSDs. Glycosphingolipid and oligosaccharide markers showed 100% sensitivity and specificity for the identification of Fabry disease, alpha-mannosidosis, mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) IVA, MPS IIIA, Tay-Sachs disease, and I-cell disease. Lower sensitivities were observed for Gaucher disease and sialidosis. No useful markers were identified for Krabbe disease, MPS II, Pompe disease, and Sandhoff disease. The protein markers LAMP-1 and saposin C were not able to differentiate individuals who had an LSD from the control population. Newborn screening for selected LSDs is possible with current technology. However, additional development is required to provide a broad coverage of disorders in a single, viable program."

    "abstract": "Previous reports have found that non-Jewish Americans with ancestry from Ireland have an increased frequency of heterozygosity for Tay-Sachs disease (TSD), although frequency estimates are substantially different. Our goal in this study was to determine the frequency of heterozygosity for TSD and Sandhoff diseases (SD) among Irish Americans, as well as in persons of English, Scottish, and/or Welsh ancestry and in individuals with Italian heritage, who were referred for determination of their heterozygosity status and who had no known family history of TSD or SD or of heterozygosity for these conditions. Of 610 nonpregnant subjects with Irish background, 24 TSD heterozygotes were identified by biochemical testing, corresponding to a heterozygote frequency of 1 in 25 (4%; 95% CI, 1/39-1/17). In comparison, of 322 nonpregnant individuals with ancestry from England, Scotland, or Wales, two TSD heterozygotes were identified (1 in 161 or 0.62%; 95% CI, 1/328-1/45), and three TSD heterozygotes were ascertained from 436 nonpregnant individuals with Italian heritage (1 in 145 or 0.69%; 95% CI, 1/714-1/50). Samples from 21 Irish heterozygotes were analyzed for HEXA gene mutations. Two (9.5%) Irish heterozygotes had the lethal + 1 IVS-9 G --> A mutation, whereas 9 (42.8%) had a benign pseudodeficiency mutation. No mutation was found in 10 (47.6%) heterozygotes. These data allow for a frequency estimate of deleterious alleles for TSD among Irish Americans of 1 in 305 (95% CI, 1/2517-1/85) to 1 in 41 (95% CI, 1/72-1/35), depending on whether one, respectively, excludes or includes enzyme-defined heterozygotes lacking a defined deleterious mutation. Pseudodeficiency mutations were identified in both of the heterozygotes with ancestry from other countries in the British Isles, suggesting that individuals with ancestry from these countries do not have an increased rate of TSD heterozygosity. Four SD heterozygotes were found among individuals of Italian descent, a frequency of 1 in 109 (0.92%; 95% CI, 1/400-1/43). This frequency was higher than those for other populations, including those with Irish (1 in 305 or 0.33%; 95% CI, 1/252-1/85), English, Scottish, or Welsh (1 in 161 or 0.62%; 95% CI, 1/1328-1/45), or Ashkenazi Jewish (1 in 281 or 0.36%; 95% CI, 1/1361-1/96) ancestry. Individuals of Irish or Italian heritage might benefit from genetic counseling for TSD and SD, respectively."

We were able to separate sphingolipidoses by lysosomal enzyme screening. A total of 300 patients (15%) with sphingolipidoses were diagnosed; there were deficiencies of arylsulfatase A [metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD)] in 93 (31%), hexosaminidase [Sandhoff disease (SHD)] in 62 (20.7%), hexosaminidase A [Tay-Sachs disease (TSD)] in 15 (5%), beta-galactosidase (GM1 gangliosidosis) in 35 (11.7%), alpha-galactosidase (Fabry disease) in one (0.3%) cerebroside beta-galactosidase (Krabbe disease) in 65 (21.7%) and glucosylceramidase (Gaucher disease) in 29 (9.6%). SHD (20.7%), MLD (31%) and Krabbe disease (21.7%) were common. Prenatal enzymatic diagnosis was made in 70 at risk pregnancies, 64 for TSD and SHD, three for MLD and three for GM1 gangliosidosis by using chorionic villus biopsy in 54, cord blood samples in 12 and cultured amniotic fluid cells in four. Seventeen fetuses were found to be affected. We have calculated the relative frequency and minimum incidence of sphingolipidoses in Turkey. The combined incidence of sphingolipidoses is 4.615 per 100,000 live births. The calculated incidences are 1.43, 0.95, 1, 0.23, 0.54, 0.45, 0.015 per 100,000 live births for MLD, SHD, Krabbe, Gaucher, TSD, GM1 gangliosidosis and Fabry diseases, respectively. The real incidence, which covers all subtypes of this group of diseases, should be greater than this number. The results suggested that, as a group, sphingolipidoses are relatively common and represent an important health problem in Turkey and some rare autosomal recessive diseases of Turkey are due to 'founder effect' created by consanguineous marriages."

Education for those offered a screening test is essential in facilitating informed decision-making. In Melbourne, Australia, we have designed, developed, and evaluated a computer-based instructional resource for use in the Tay Sachs disease carrier screening program for secondary school students attending Jewish schools. The resource entitled \"Genetics in the Community: Tay Sachs disease\" was designed on a platform of educational learning theory. The development of the resource included formative evaluation using qualitative data analysis supported by descriptive quantitative data. The final resource was evaluated within the screening program and compared with the standard oral presentation using a questionnaire. Knowledge outcomes were measured both before and after either of the educational formats. Data from the formative evaluation were used to refine the content and functionality of the final resource. The questionnaire evaluation of 302 students over two years showed the multimedia resource to be equally effective as an oral educational presentation in facilitating participants' knowledge construction. The resource offers a large number of potential benefits, which are not limited to the Tay Sachs disease carrier screening program setting, such as delivery of a consistent educational message, short delivery time, and minimum financial and resource commitment. This article outlines the value of considering educational theory and describes the process of multimedia development providing a framework that may be of value when designing genetics multimedia resources in general."

    "abstract": "The deficiency of the A isoenzyme of beta-hexosaminidase (Hex) produced by different mutations of the gene that codes for the alpha subunit (Tay-Sachs disease) has two variants with enzymological differences: the B variant consists of the absence of Hex A isoenzyme and the B1 variant produces an inactive Hex A isoenzyme for the hydrolysis of the GM2 ganglioside and synthetic substrates with negative charge. In contrast to the early childhood form of the B variant, the B1 variant appears at a later clinical stage (3 to 7 years of age) with neurodegenerative symptoms leading to the death of the patient in the second decade of life. The most frequent mutation responsible for the GM2 gangliosidosis B1 variant is R178H, which has a widespread geographic and ethnic distribution. The highest incidence has been described in Portugal, which has been suggested as the point of origin of this mutation. Biochemical characterization of this lysosomal disease is carried out using negatively charged synthetic alpha subunit-specific sulfated substrates, since Hex A isoenzyme heat-inactivation assays are not applicable. However, the determination of the apparent activation energy of Hex using the neutral substrate 3,3'-dichlorophenolsulfonphthaleinyl N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminide, may offer a valid alternative. The presence of an alpha subunit in the alphabeta heterodimer Hex A means that its activation energy (41.8 kJ/mol) is significantly lower than that of the betabeta homodimer Hex B (75.1 kJ/mol); however, as mutation inactivates the alpha subunit, the Hex A of the B1 variant presents an activation energy that is similar to that of the Hex B isoenzyme."

Seventeen subjects (13 men, 4 women) diagnosed with GM2 gangliosidosis were evaluated. Subjects ranged in age from 18 to 56 years and were in various stages of disease progression. Subjects underwent comprehensive neuropsychological assessment. Impairment was defined as performance more than 1.6 SD below the normative mean. Group mean performance was within the denoted normal range on all measures except on a task assessing visual sequencing and set shifting. Approximately one-half of the sample scored in the impaired range on measures of processing speed, visual sequencing, and set shifting. One-third of the sample also scored in the impaired range on measures of delayed verbal recall. Impairment tended to be restricted to a subset of the sample, as 5 of the 14 subjects able to undergo formal testing accounted for 70% of the total number of impaired scores. If the three subjects unable to participate in formal testing are also considered impaired, 47% of the current sample exhibited significant cognitive impairment in at least one cognitive domain. In late-onset GM2 gangliosidosis, there is a risk of impairment in executive functioning and memory as well as cerebellar dysfunction. Dementia was not present in any subjects in the current sample."

    "abstract": "A founder effect can account for the presence of an allele at an unusually high frequency in an isolated population if the allele is selectively neutral and if all copies are identical by descent with a copy that either was carried by a founder individual or arose by mutation later. Here, a statistical test of both aspects of the founder-effect hypothesis is developed. The test is performed by a modified version of a program that implements the Slatkin-Bertorelle test of neutrality. The test is applied to several disease-associated alleles found predominantly in Ashkenazi Jews. Despite considerable uncertainty about the demographic history of Ashkenazi Jews and their ancestors, available genetic data are consistent with a founder effect resulting from a severe bottleneck in population size between a.d. 1100 and a.d. 1400 and an earlier bottleneck in a.d. 75, at the beginning of the Jewish Diaspora. The relatively high frequency of alleles causing four different lysosomal storage disorders, including Tay-Sachs disease and Gaucher disease, can be accounted for if the disease-associated alleles are recessive in their effects on reproductive fitness."

    "abstract": "Sandhoff disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused by mutations in the HEXB gene which encodes for the beta-subunit of beta-hexosaminidase A and B, resulting in ganglioside GM(2) accumulation in the brain. We now demonstrate that phospholipid metabolism is altered in both cultured neurons and in brain tissue from a mouse model of Sandhoff disease, the Hexb-/- mouse. Metabolic labelling using [methyl-(14)C]choline and l-[3-(3)H]serine demonstrated reduced incorporation of [methyl-(14)C]choline into phospholipids in brain tissue but not in liver or spleen. Phospholipid mass was also reduced in brain. The activities of CTP : phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CCT) and phosphatidylserine synthase were also reduced in brain tissue from Hexb-/- mice, probably because of post-translational modification as no changes were observed in levels of enzyme expression. The relevance of these findings to Sandhoff disease in human patients is strengthened by observations made over 30 years ago on autopsy tissue of Tay Sachs and Sandhoff disease patients, in which reduced phospholipid levels were observed. We suggest that changes in phospholipid metabolism are not simply because of loss of neuronal tissue as a result of degeneration but rather may cause degeneration, and we discuss the possible effects that changes in phospholipid metabolism could play in the neuropathophysiology of Sandhoff disease."

Their presenting symptoms were a long history of abnormal head and eye movements. One twin developed partial sensory seizures. The patients underwent 16-channel EEG, electro-oculographic recordings, MRI of the brain, and genetic and metabolic investigations. EEG findings were consistent with idiopathic generalized epilepsy. Electrooculographic recordings of the saccades confirmed an inability to elicit horizontal saccades without preceding head movement; saccades to the left were better than saccades to the right. MR scans for one twin showed normal findings, however, for the twin who had meningitis they revealed asymmetry between the right and left temporal lobes but no specific abnormality. DNA analysis using a series of autosomal polymorphic markers confirmed the monozygocity of the twins. White blood cell enzyme analysis excluded Sandhoff disease, Tay-Sachs disease, GM1 gangliosidosis, metacromatic leucodystrophy, Gaucher disease, Niemann-Pick disease (A and B), and Krabbe leucodystrophy. Albumin and immunoglobulin (IgA, IgG, and IgM) levels were normal. It is concluded that autosomal recessive inheritance seems the most likely explanation here, as recent studies have found insertion and missense mutations of the aprataxin gene which have been related to an early onset form of ataxia with ocular motor apraxia and hypoalbuminaemia."

The World Health Organization (WHO) published several preconditions for community carrier screening. This paper aims to present some of the dilemmas about screening in Israel and the difficulties in following the WHO's helpful criteria. Some of the genetic diseases that are rare in the world are relatively common among several communities in Israel, and one of the dilemmas is for which of them screening is justified. Consensus exists among professionals and among the public about screening for a severe disease like Tay-Sachs, but the justification for screening for a disease with a widely variable expression, like Gaucher disease, is debatable. Another dilemma is whether to offer screening to the general population when the options to solve the problem are still not clear, as is the case of screening for carriers of BRCA1 and BRCA2. The author also explains why geneticists in Israel cooperate with a screening program in the ultra-orthodox community, although it is done according to unusual rules."

    "abstract": "Seven Brazilian Tay-Sachs disease cases were screened for the most frequent causative mutations. They all presented at least one copy of the IVS7+1g>c mutation. Three patients were homozygotes, three were compound heterozygotes, and in one case only the mother was tested and shown to carry the IVS7+1g>c mutation. In the second allele the compound heterozygotes presented: R178H (the DN allele), InsTATC1278 and an unidentified mutation. The IVS7+1g>c mutation has already been described in three Portuguese patients. In this study, all families were unaware of any Portuguese ancestry. Since Brazil was a Portuguese colony, the mutation most probably came from ancient common ancestry. The initial molecular analysis of Tay-Sachs disease patients in Brazil indicated a prevalence of the IVS7+1g>c mutation, possibly as a result of genetic drift."

    "abstract": "Tay-Sachs disease is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disease resulting from a block in the hydrolysis of GM2 ganglioside, an intermediate in ganglioside catabolism. The mouse model of Tay-Sachs disease (Hexa -/-) has been described as behaviorally indistinguishable from wild type until at least 1 year of age due to a sialidase-mediated bypass of the metabolic defect that reduces the rate of GM2 ganglioside accumulation. In this study, we have followed our mouse model to over 2 years of age and have documented a significant disease phenotype that is reminiscent of the late onset, chronic form of human Tay-Sachs disease. Onset occurs at 11-12 months of age and progresses slowly, in parallel with increasing storage of GM2 ganglioside. The disease is characterized by hind limb spasticity, weight loss, tremors, abnormal posture with lordosis, possible visual impairment, and, late in the disease, muscle weakness, clasping of the limbs, and myoclonic twitches of the head. Immunodetection of GM2 ganglioside showed that storage varies widely in different regions, but is most intense in pyriform cortex, hippocampus (CA3 field, subiculum), amygdala, hypothalamus (paraventricular supraoptic, ventromedial and arcuate nuclei, and mammilary body), and the somatosensory cortex (layer V) in 1- to 2-year-old mutant mice. We suggest that the Tay-Sachs mouse model is a phenotypically valid model of disease and may provide for a reliable indicator of the impact of therapeutic strategies, in particular geared to the late onset, chronic form of human Tay-Sachs disease."

    "abstract": "To study the prevalence and clinical profile of cerebral lipidoses in patients with progressive neurodegeneration. A total of 771 patients clinically diagnosed with a progressive neurodegenerative disease were investigated for lipidoses. Specific enzyme assays in serum and leucocytes and other relevant investigations, including histopathology, neuroimaging and neurophysiological studies were conducted when indicated. Fifty-four cases of sphingolipidoses and 1 case of sialidosis type 1 were diagnosed. The sphingolipidoses consisted of 30 cases of metachromatic leukodystrophy, 13 cases of Tay-Sachs disease and its variants, 11 cases of Sandhoff disease, and 1 case each of Niemann-Pick disease and multiple sulphatase deficiency. The clinical features were similar to earlier reports. Parental consanguinity was present in 63.6% of patients. In south India, where consanguineous marriages are strongly favoured, inherited diseases such as the cerebral lipidoses should be considered when evaluating a patient with progressive neurodegeneration. The establishment of specialised referral centres would provide a helpful approach to the prevention and management of these fatal disorders."

    "abstract": "Conventional asymmetric PCR is inefficient and difficult to optimize because limiting the concentration of one primer lowers its melting temperature below the reaction annealing temperature. Linear-After-The-Exponential (LATE)-PCR describes a new paradigm for primer design that renders assays as efficient as symmetric PCR assays, regardless of primer ratio. LATE-PCR generates single-stranded products with predictable kinetics for many cycles beyond the exponential phase. LATE-PCR also introduces new probe design criteria that uncouple hybridization probe detection from primer annealing and extension, increase probe reliability, improve allele discrimination, and increase signal strength by 80-250% relative to symmetric PCR. These improvements in PCR are particularly useful for real-time quantitative analysis of target numbers in small samples. LATE-PCR is adaptable to high throughput applications in fields such as clinical diagnostics, biodefense, forensics, and DNA sequencing. We showcase LATE-PCR via amplification of the cystic fibrosis CFDelta508 allele and the Tay-Sachs disease TSD 1278 allele from single heterozygous cells."

    "abstract": "The 1278insTATC is the most prevalent beta-hexosaminidase A ( HEXA) gene mutation causing Tay-Sachs disease (TSD), one of the four lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) occurring at elevated frequencies among Ashkenazi Jews (AJs). To investigate the genetic history of this mutation in the AJ population, a conserved haplotype (D15S981:175-D15S131:240-D15S1050:284-D15S197:144-D15S188:418) was identified in 1278insTATC chromosomes from 55 unrelated AJ individuals (15 homozygotes and 40 heterozygotes for the TSD mutation), suggesting the occurrence of a common founder. When two methods were used for analysis of linkage disequilibrium (LD) between flanking polymorphic markers and the disease locus and for the study of the decay of LD over time, the estimated age of the insertion was found to be 40+/-12 generations (95% confidence interval: 30-50 generations), so that the most recent common ancestor of the mutation-bearing chromosomes would date to the 8th-9th century. This corresponds with the demographic expansion of AJs in central Europe, following the founding of the Ashkenaz settlement in the early Middle Ages. The results are consistent with the geographic distribution of the main TSD mutation, 1278insTATC being more common in central Europe, and with the coalescent times of mutations causing two other LSDs, Gaucher disease and mucolipidosis type IV. Evidence for the absence of a determinant positive selection (heterozygote advantage) over the mutation is provided by a comparison between the estimated age of 1278insTATC and the probability of the current AJ frequency of the mutant allele as a function of its age, calculated by use of a branching-process model. Therefore, the founder effect in a rapidly expanding population arising from a bottleneck provides a robust parsimonious hypothesis explaining the spread of 1278insTATC-linked TSD in AJ individuals."

    "abstract": "Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff diseases are lysosomal storage disorders that result from an inherited deficiency of beta-hexosaminidase A (alphabeta). Whereas the acute forms are associated with a total absence of hexosaminidase A and early death, the chronic adult forms exist with activity and protein levels of approximately 5%, and unaffected individuals have been found with only 10% of normal levels. Surprisingly, almost all disease-associated missense mutations do not affect the active site of the enzyme but, rather, inhibit its ability to obtain and/or retain its native fold in the endoplasmic reticulum, resulting in its retention and accelerated degradation. By growing adult Tay-Sachs fibroblasts in culture medium containing known inhibitors of hexosaminidase we have raised the residual protein and activity levels of intralysosomal hexosaminidase A well above the critical 10% of normal levels. A similar effect was observed in fibroblasts from an adult Sandhoff patient. We propose that these hexosaminidase inhibitors function as pharmacological chaperones, enhancing the stability of the native conformation of the enzyme, increasing the amount of hexosaminidase A capable of exiting the endoplasmic reticulum for transport to the lysosome. Therefore, pharmacological chaperones could provide a novel approach to the treatment of adult Tay-Sachs and possibly Sandhoff diseases."

The first part of the survey consisted of information about three diseases: familial breast cancer, Tay-Sachs disease, and hypercholesterolemia. The second part was a questionnaire developed by the authors, which explored students' attitudes toward testing for these diseases. Comparisons between and within groups were performed using X2 analysis. Out of the 672 surveys distributed, 361 were returned (54% response rate). Mean age of participants was 17 +/- 1 years. Most girls (67%) wanted to be tested for familial breast cancer. Girls were significantly more willing than boys to be tested for Tay-Sachs disease (23% vs. 13%, p <.002) and for hypercholesterolemia (54% vs. 39%, p <.001). Girls who had a relative with breast cancer were significantly more willing to be tested than other girls (p <.05). Individuals in the ethnic risk groups for Tay-Sachs disease were significantly more willing to be tested than those not in the ethnic risk groups (p <.001). However, only 33% of those in the ethnic risk groups for Tay-Sachs disease stated that they would either \"definitely\" or \"probably\" wish to be tested. Students who had a family history of high cholesterol were significantly more willing to be tested than those without a family history (70% vs. 34%, p <.0001). About 81% of the students with a family history of high cholesterol had never been referred for cholesterol testing. Only about 25% of participants stated that their attitude toward genetic testing was affected by concerns that genetic information might be misused by insurance companies/employers. The main motivator for genetic testing is having someone in the family affected by the disease in question. Adolescent girls are more willing to be tested for genetic diseases than are boys."

    "abstract": "The incidence of Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) carriers, as defined by enzyme assay, is 1:29 among Ashkenazi Jews and 1:110 among Moroccan Jews. An elevated carrier frequency of 1:140 was also observed in the Iraqi Jews (IJ), while in other Israeli populations the world's pan-ethnic frequency of approximately 1:280 has been found. Recently a novel mutation, G749T, has been reported in 38.7% of the IJ carriers (24/62). Here we report a second novel HEXA mutation specific to the IJ TDS carriers: a substitution of cytosine 1351 by guanosine (C1351G), resulting in the change of leucine to valine in position 451. This mutation was found in 33.9% (21/62) of the carriers and in none of 100 non-carrier IJ. In addition to the two specific mutations, 14.5% (9/62) of the IJ carriers bear a known \"Jewish\" mutation (Ashkenazi or Moroccan) and 11.3% (7/62) carry a known \"non-Jewish\" mutation. In 1 DNA sample no mutation has yet been detected. To investigate the genetic history of the IJ-specific mutations (C1351G and G749T), the allelic distribution of four polymorphic markers (D15S131, D15S1025, D15S981, D15S1050) was analyzed in IJ heterozygotes and ethnically matched controls. Based on linkage disequilibrium, recombination factor (theta) between the markers and mutated loci, and the population growth correction, we deduced that G749T occurred in a founder ancestor 44.8 +/- 14.2 generations (g) ago [95% confidence interval (CI) 17.0-72.6 g] and C1351G arose 80.4 +/- 35.9 g ago (95% CI 44.5-116.3 g). Thus, the estimated dates for introduction of mutations are: 626 +/- 426 A.D. (200-1052 A.D.) for G749T and 442 +/- 1077 B.C. (1519 B.C. to 635 A.D.) for C1351G."

Furthermore, we have shown that overexpression of human sialidase is sufficient to clear accumulated ganglioside in Tay-Sachs neuroglia [Hum. Mol. Genet. 8 (1999) 1111]. In this paper, we have characterized the 5' regulatory region of the mouse lysosomal sialidase gene in order to understand the molecular mechanisms regulating its expression. We used bioinformatic approaches to identify a transcriptional initiation site at -45 bp relative to the ATG and significant sequence homology with the rat and human promoters. Expression by the promoter was found to be cell-type restricted and required at least 750 bp upstream of the ATG for high-level expression. DNAse I footprinting analysis and reporter gene assays indicated that the promoter is responsive to Sp-1. We discovered a CCAAT box and four E-boxes within the mouse upstream region and demonstrated that CCAAT displacement protein as well as the muscle regulatory factors MyoD and Myf-5 influence sialidase expression. Taken together, these results identify cis- and trans-acting factors involved in the regulation of sialidase and point to mechanisms of gene upregulation."

    "abstract": "The glycosphingolipid (GSL) lysosomal storage diseases are a family of human metabolic diseases that, in their severest forms, cause death in early infancy, as a result of progressive neurodegeneration. They are caused by mutations in the genes encoding the glycohydrolases or the activator proteins that catabolise GSLs within lysosomes. In these diseases the GSL substrate of the defective enzyme accumulates in the lysosome, where it is stored and leads to cellular dysfunction and disease. The therapeutic options for treating these diseases are relatively limited; in fact, there are currently no available therapies for most of these disorders. The problem is further compounded by difficulties in delivering therapeutic agents to the central nervous system, which is where the pathology is frequently manifested. To date, research effort has mainly focused on strategies for augmenting enzyme concentrations to compensate for the underlying defect. These strategies include bone-marrow transplantation, enzyme-replacement therapy and gene therapy. Our group has been exploring the alternative strategy of substrate deprivation. This approach aims to balance the rate of GSL synthesis with the impaired rate of GSL breakdown. Studies using an asymptomatic mouse model of Tay-Sachs disease have shown that substrate deprivation prevents GSL storage. In a severe neurodegenerative mouse model of Sandhoff disease, substrate deprivation delayed the onset of symptoms and disease progression, and significantly increased life expectancy. The implications of this research for human therapy have been discussed."

    "abstract": "The aim of carrier testing is to identify carrier couples at risk of having offspring with a serious genetic (autosomal recessive) disorder. Carrier couples are offered genetic consultation where their reproductive options, including prenatal diagnosis, are explained. The Ashkenazi Jewish population is at increased risk for several recessively inherited disorders (Tay-Sachs disease, Cystic fibrosis, Canavan disease, Gaucher disease, Familial Dysautonomia, Niemann-Pick disease, Fanconi anemia, and Bloom syndrome). Unlike Tay-Sachs disease, there is no simple biochemical or enzymatic test to detect carriers for these other disorders. However, with the rapid identification of disease-causing genes in recent years, DNA-based assays are increasingly available for carrier detection. Approximately 5% of the world's population carries a mutation affecting the globin chains of the hemoglobin molecule. Among the most common of these disorders are the thalassemias. The global birth rate of affected infants is at least 2 per 1000 (in unscreened populations), with the greatest incidence in Southeast Asian, Indian, Mediterranean, and Middle Eastern ethnic groups. Carriers are detected by evaluation of red cell indices and morphology, followed by more sophisticated hematological testing and molecular analyses. The following issues need to be considered in the development of a carrier screening program: (1) test selection based on disease severity and test accuracy; (2) funding for testing and genetic counselling; (3) definition of the target population to be screened; (4) development of a public and professional education program; (5) informed consent for screening; and (6) awareness of community needs."

Moreover, the more likely a negative outcome was perceived to be, the more responsible the mother was held for not taking the genetic screening test.

However, there is little national data as to who is performing the tests and the reasons for doing or not doing so. This study evaluated the proportion of Jewish women in Israel who perform the various prenatal genetic tests and the factors affecting the performance of these tests. It was found that 60.9% of the women performed the triple test, 50.8% of women older than 35 years performed amniocentesis, while 63.3 and 24.3% of women performed Tay-Sachs and fragile-X carrier testing respectively. Ninety-six percent of the secular women compared to only 6.7% of the ultrareligious women performed the triple test. It was also found that94.4% of the secular women, 36.4% of the religious, and none of the ultrareligious women older than 35 years performed amniocentesis. In the stepwise regression analysis, being secular, having a higher income, fewer children, and being of Ashkenazi origin remained significant factors in determining performance of Tay-Sachs carrier testing. As regards fragile-X carrier testing, being secular, having fewer than four children, and having a higher income and a supplementary medical insurance remained significant factors. The main reason reported by the women for not performing amniocentesis or the triple test was for religious or moral grounds (53.3 and 67% respectively). The main reason given for not performing Tay-Sachs or fragile-X testing was that they were not referred for the tests (76 and 82% respectively). Consideration should be given to providing first trimester prenatal diagnosis to the ultrareligious group, including state subsidized fragile-X testing and educating the primary care givers about the importance of prenatal genetic testing. The information from the present study is vital for the planning of an equitable prenatal genetic service and provides guidelines for the implementation of such services in other countries."

Although the genetic and biochemical bases for a massive cerebral accumulation of ganglioside GM2 in TSD have been well established, the mechanism for the neural dysfunction in TSD remains elusive. Upon analysis of GSLs from a variant B TS brain, we have detected a novel GSL that has not been previously revealed. We have isolated this GSL in pure form. Using NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and chemical synthesis, the structure of this unusual GSL was established to be a taurine-conjugated GM2 (tauro-GM2) in which the carboxyl group of N-acetylneuraminic acid was amidated by taurine. Using a rabbit anti-tauro-GM2 serum, we also detected the presence of tauro-GM2 in three other small brain samples from one variant B and two variant O TSD patients. On the other hand, tauro-GM2 was not found in three normal human brain samples. The presence of tauro-GM2 in TS brains, but not in normal brains, indicates the possible association of this unusual GM2 derivative with the pathogenesis of TSD. Our findings point to taurine conjugation as a heretofore unelucidated mechanism for TS brain to cope with water-insoluble GM2."

They occur in three isoforms, the homodimeric hexosaminidases B (betabeta) and S (alphaalpha), and the heterodimeric hexosaminidase A (alphabeta), where dimerization is required for catalytic activity. Allelic variations in the HEXA and HEXB genes cause the fatal inborn errors of metabolism Tay-Sachs disease and Sandhoff disease, respectively. Here, we present the crystal structure of a complex of human beta-hexosaminidase B with a transition state analogue inhibitor at 2.3A resolution (pdb 1o7a). On the basis of this structure and previous studies on related enzymes, a retaining double-displacement mechanism for glycosyl hydrolysis by beta-hexosaminidase B is proposed. In the dimer structure, which is derived from an analysis of crystal packing, most of the mutations causing late-onset Sandhoff disease reside near the dimer interface and are proposed to interfere with correct dimer formation. The structure reported here is a valid template also for the dimeric structures of beta-hexosaminidase A and S."

The mutation is a single nucleotide transition (G to A) at the last nucleotide of exon 3 of hexosaminidase A (HEX A) alpha-subunit gene. The 14 exons and their flanking sequences of the HEX A gene were amplified and analyzed by polymerase chain reaction-single stranded conformational polymorphism (PCR-SSCP). Sequencing of exon 3 showed a homozygous mutation. Cultured patient's fibroblasts produced no detectable mRNA for HEX A alpha-subunit gene by Northern blot analysis. We speculate that abnormal mRNA was rapidly degraded following transcription. Our data are consistent with the idea that the severe infantile form of Tay-Sachs disease is associated with a total lack of Hex A activity in the patient. A similar mutation (G to T) had been observed at the 5'-donor splice site of exon 3. It resulted in abnormal splicing and skipping of exon 3. The other acceptor and donor splice site mutations described in the HEX A gene ablate normal mRNA splicing. Identification of multiple mutant HEX A alleles shows molecular heterogeneity of infantile Tay-Sachs disease in our population."

Both of these mutations, a 12 bp deletion (1096-1107 or 1098-1108 or 1099-1109) in exon 10 and a point mutation (G1362 to A, Gly454 to Asp) in exon 12, are located in the catalytic domain of the hexosaminidase alpha-chain. In order to determine whether these mutations affect the function of the catalytic domain or result in an instable protein, both mutant cDNAs were overexpressed in COS-1 cells. As judged by Western blotting, transfections of wild-type cDNA produced pro-alpha-chain and mature alpha-chain in parallel with a fivefold increase in cellular hexosaminidase activity using the synthetic substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl beta-N-acetylglucosamine 6-sulfate (MUGS). However, both mutants produced only pro-alpha-chains, although no mature form or detectable hexosaminidase activity towards two different synthetic substrates was observed. These data are consistent with the biochemical phenotype of infantile Tay-Sachs disease. We conclude that the overexpressed mutant pro-alpha-chains were misfolded and could not undergo further proteolytic processing to the active form of the enzyme in the lysosome."

Hex A is a heterodimer of subunits alpha and beta (60% identity), whereas Hex B is a homodimer of beta-subunits. Interest in human beta-hexosaminidase stems from its association with Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff disease; these are prototypical lysosomal storage disorders resulting from the abnormal accumulation of G(M2)-ganglioside (G(M2)). Hex A degrades G(M2) by removing a terminal N-acetyl-D-galactosamine (beta-GalNAc) residue, and this activity requires the G(M2)-activator, a protein which solubilizes the ganglioside for presentation to Hex A. We present here the crystal structure of human Hex B, alone (2.4A) and in complex with the mechanistic inhibitors GalNAc-isofagomine (2.2A) or NAG-thiazoline (2.5A). From these, and the known X-ray structure of the G(M2)-activator, we have modeled Hex A in complex with the activator and ganglioside. Together, our crystallographic and modeling data demonstrate how alpha and beta-subunits dimerize to form either Hex A or Hex B, how these isoenzymes hydrolyze diverse substrates, and how many documented point mutations cause Sandhoff disease (beta-subunit mutations) and Tay-Sachs disease (alpha-subunit mutations)."

    "abstract": "Tay-Sachs disease is a form of monosialoganglioside triaose (GM2) gangliosidosis that results from the mutations in the alpha-subunit gene of hexosaminidase A. In the B1 variant, the active site of the alpha-subunit of the enzyme is thought to be affected. In the present study, a patient who had previously been diagnosed as a B1 variant is further analyzed. The patient's parents and brother were also analyzed. Single-stranded conformational polymorphism (SSCP) and DNA sequencing analysis were conducted in all cases. In addition, hexosaminidase A (Hex A) was isolated from leukocyte homogenates of the patient's parents and brother using DE 52 ion-exchange chromatography, and thermostability analyses of the isolated enzymes were performed. Hexosaminidase A of the parents was found to be more thermostable than normal Hex A. DNA sequencing analysis revealed a 12-bp deletion mutation in exon 10 of the Hex A gene. The patient was a homozygote and the parents were heterozygotes for the mutation, which could also be observed at the DNA double strands by SSCP analysis. These deleted bases are located within the catalytic domain of the alpha-subunit. The 12-bp deletion mutation in exon 10 of Hex A is responsible for the increased thermostability of the enzyme. Considering this mutation has previously been found in a Turkish Tay-Sachs patient, the patient in the present study may have another mutation on the Hex B gene that causes decreased thermostability of the enzyme. Thermal inactivation assay may not be sufficient for a correct diagnosis in such unusual cases."

    "abstract": "Mouse models of the GM2 gangliosidoses [Tay-Sachs, late onset Tay-Sachs (LOTS), Sandhoff] and GM1 gangliosidosis have been studied to determine whether there is a common neuro-inflammatory component to these disorders. During the disease course, we have: (i) examined the expression of a number of inflammatory markers in the CNS, including MHC class II, CD68, CD11b (CR3), 7/4, F4/80, nitrotyrosine, CD4 and CD8; (ii) profiled cytokine production [tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha), transforming growth factor (TGF beta 1) and interleukin 1 beta (IL1 beta)]; and (iii) studied blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity. The kinetics of apoptosis and the expression of Fas and TNF-R1 were also assessed. In all symptomatic mouse models, a progressive increase in local microglial activation/expansion and infiltration of inflammatory cells was noted. Altered BBB permeability was evident in Sandhoff and GM1 mice, but absent in LOTS mice. Progressive CNS inflammation coincided with the onset of clinical signs in these mouse models. Substrate reduction therapy in the Sandhoff mouse model slowed the rate of accumulation of glycosphingolipids in the CNS, thus delaying the onset of the inflammatory process and disease pathogenesis. These data suggest that inflammation may play an important role in the pathogenesis of the gangliosidoses."

    "abstract": "The presence of four lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) at increased frequency in the Ashkenazi Jewish population has suggested to many the operation of natural selection (carrier advantage) as the driving force. We compare LSDs and nonlysosomal storage diseases (NLSDs) in terms of the number of mutations, allele-frequency distributions, and estimated coalescence dates of mutations. We also provide new data on the European geographic distribution, in the Ashkenazi population, of seven LSD and seven NLSD mutations. No differences in any of the distributions were observed between LSDs and NLSDs. Furthermore, no regular pattern of geographic distribution was observed for LSD versus NLSD mutations-with some being more common in central Europe and others being more common in eastern Europe, within each group. The most striking disparate pattern was the geographic distribution of the two primary Tay-Sachs disease mutations, with the first being more common in central Europe (and likely older) and the second being exclusive to eastern Europe (primarily Lithuania and Russia) (and likely much younger). The latter demonstrates a pattern similar to two other recently arisen Lithuanian mutations, those for torsion dystonia and familial hypercholesterolemia. These observations provide compelling support for random genetic drift (chance founder effects, one approximately 11 centuries ago that affected all Ashkenazim and another approximately 5 centuries ago that affected Lithuanians), rather than selection, as the primary determinant of disease mutations in the Ashkenazi population."

    "abstract": "Variant B1 is a rare type of GM2 gangliosidosis. Clinically, it shows a wide spectrum of forms ranging from infantile to juvenile. We report the first magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings from three patients affected by GM2 gangliosidosis variant B1, two presenting with the infantile form and one with the juvenile form. The MRI appearances of the two patients with the infantile form disease are congruent with those reported for the early-onset type of both Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff diseases, and are characterized by early involvement of the basal ganglia and thalamus with cortical atrophy appearing later. In contrast, the patient with the juvenile form of variant B1 showed progressive cortical and white-matter atrophy of the supratentorial structures and, to a lesser extent, the infratentorial structures. No basal ganglia or thalamic anomalies were observed. Because in the adult forms of both Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff diseases a progressive cerebellar atrophy represents the only abnormality detectable, it appears that an MRI pattern peculiar to GM2 gangliosidosis can be defined. This pattern ranges from the basal ganglia injury associated with the early and severe demyelination process noted in the infantile form of the disease, to cerebellar atrophy with no supratentorial anomalies in the adult form. An \"intermediate\" MRI picture, with cortical atrophy and mild cerebellar atrophy, but without basal ganglia impairment, can be observed in the juvenile form. In addition, our investigations suggest that MRI abnormalities in GM2 gangliosidosis correlate with the clinical form of the disease rather than with the biochemical variant of the enzymatic defect."

    "abstract": "Human beta-hexosaminidase A (Hex A) (alphabeta) is composed of two subunits whose primary structures are approximately 60% identical. Deficiency of either subunit results in severe neurological disease due to the storage of GM2 ganglioside; Tay-Sachs disease, alpha deficiency, and Sandhoff disease, beta deficiency. Whereas both subunits contain active sites only the alpha-site can efficiently bind negatively charged 6-sulfated hexosamine substrates and GM2 ganglioside. We have recently identified the alphaArg(424) as playing a critical role in the binding of 6-sulfate-containing substrates, and betaAsp(452) as actively inhibiting their binding. To determine if these same residues affect the binding of the sialic acid moiety of GM2 ganglioside, an alphaArg(424)Gln form of Hex A was expressed and its kinetics analyzed using the GM2 activator protein:[3H]-GM2 ganglioside complex as a substrate. The mutant showed a approximately 3-fold increase in its K(m) for the complex. Next a form of Hex B (betabeta) containing a double mutation, betaAspLeu(453)AsnArg (duplicating the alpha-aligning sequences), was expressed. As compared to the wild type (WT), the mutant exhibited a >30-fold increase in its ability to hydrolyze a 6-sulfated substrate and was now able to hydrolyze GM2 ganglioside when the GM2 activator protein was replaced by sodium taurocholate. Thus, this alpha-site is critical for binding both types of negatively charge substrates."

The resulting amplicons were detected in real time with two molecular beacons each with a different colored fluorochrome. The kinetics of amplicon accumulation generate objective criteria by which to evaluate the validity of each reaction. The assay had an overall utility of 95%, based on the detection of at least one signal in 235 of the 248 attempted tests and an efficiency of 97%, as 7 of the 235 samples were excluded from further analysis for objective quantitative reasons. The accuracy of the assay was 99.1%, because 228 of 230 samples gave signals consistent with the genotype of the cells. Only two of the 135 heterozygous samples were allele drop-outs, a rate far lower than previously reported for single-cell Tay-Sachs assays using conventional methods of PCR."

GSL catabolism occurs in the lysosome and a defect in an enzyme involved in GSL degradation leads to the lysosomal storage of its substrate(s). GSLs are abundantly expressed in the central nervous system (CNS) and the disorders frequently have a progressive neurodegenerative course. Our understanding of pathogenesis in these diseases is incomplete and currently few options exist for therapy.

The Sandhoff (Hexb-/-) mouse has severe neurological disease and mimics the human infantile onset variant. However, the Tay-Sachs (Hexa-/-) mouse model lacks an overt phenotype as mice can partially bypass the blocked catabolic pathway and escape disease. We have investigated whether a subset of Tay-Sachs mice develop late onset disease. We have found that approximately 65% of the mice develop one or more clinical signs of the disease within their natural life span (n = 52, P < 0.0001). However, 100% of female mice with repeat breeding histories developed late onset disease at an earlier age (n = 21, P < 0.0001) and displayed all clinical features. Repeat breeding of a large cohort of female Tay-Sachs mice confirmed that pregnancy induces late onset Tay-Sachs disease.

Targeted sequencing of the 39 electrophoretic variants from SSCP analysis revealed eight novel and deleterious mutations and 31 with previously described mutations. Six novel mutations were found in non-Jewish carriers, and two were found in two patients with infantile Tay-Sachs disease. Identification of these eight novel mutations provides additional insight to the mutational spectrum for the HEXA gene.

Most classic articles of 19th-century American neurologists were initial or early descriptions of clinical conditions, diseases, or procedures. These include descriptions by Beard of the Jumping Frenchmen of Maine; by Sachs of \"amaurotic family idiocy\" (Tay-Sachs disease); by Hun of the lateral medullary syndrome; by Mitchell of phantom limbs; and by Dana of familial tremor. Few of these were the initial description, although most were clear and fairly complete by modern standards. Several citation classics were cited mainly as a point of comparison with later events or developments, including those by Corning on spinal anesthesia, Bartholow on electrical stimulation of the brain, Mitchell on the status of American psychiatry, and Starr on childhood brain tumors. The reports of Corning, Bartholow, and Mitchell have been the subjects of continued controversy. The only examples of basic neuroscience among the citation classics are the classic studies by Onuf and Collins involving ablation of portions of the sympathetic chain in cats, and Onuf's description of the nucleus of Onuf in the human spinal cord. Onuf's basic science work was made possible by a unique and short-lived multidisciplinary research environment created at the New York State Pathological Institute for the scientific investigation of insanity and neurologic diseases."

Ideally, testing is done prior to conception. For Ashkenazi Jews, in whom DNA testing identifies 99.9% of carriers, DNA testing is the preferred method to ascertain carriers [14]. For non-Jewish individuals seeking carrier testing, enzyme assay should be done initially and positive or indeterminate results should be confirmed by DNA mutation analysis. If only one partner is descended from a high-risk group, that person should be tested first; only if he/ she is a carrier should the other partner be tested. If the couple is pregnant at the time carrier testing is requested, both partners should have enzyme testing (leukocyte assay for the pregnant woman and serum assay for the father) and DNA testing sent concomitantly to expedite counseling and action. Carriers are individuals with a disease causing DNA mutation or carrier range enzyme analysis results on both serum and leukocytes with no detectable mutation and no pseudodeficiency alleles. Noncarriers are individuals with normal enzyme results or carrier range enzyme results and a pseudodeficiency allele on DNA mutation analysis. If both partners are found to be carriers they should be counseled of a 25% risk of having an affected child with each pregnancy. Options to modify this risk include prenatal diagnosis by amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling, egg or sperm donation, preimplantation diagnosis or adoption."

We investigated the alpha- and beta-subunits of beta-hexosaminidases in cultured fibroblasts from cases of various forms of GM2 gangliosidosis by means of Western blotting and a chemiluminescence detection system. In a patient with infantile Tay-Sachs disease [HEXA genotype, Int5-SA(g-1-->t)/Int5-SA(g-1-->t)], the mature alpha-subunit was undetectable. In a patient with infantile Sandhoff disease (HEXB genotype, C534Y/C534Y), the mature beta-subunit was deficient. However, a small amount of the mature beta-subunit was detected in a patient with adult Sandhoff disease (HEXB genotype, R505Q(+I207V)/R505Q(+I207V)), which may have resulted in the residual enzyme activity and mild clinical course.

In each disorder, a virtually identical course of neurodegeneration begins in infancy and leads to demise generally by 4-6 years of age. Through serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE), we determined gene expression profiles in cerebral cortex from a Tay-Sachs patient, a Sandhoff disease patient and a pediatric control. Examination of genes that showed altered expression in both patients revealed molecular details of the pathophysiology of the disorders relating to neuronal dysfunction and loss. A large fraction of the elevated genes in the patients could be attributed to activated macrophages/microglia and astrocytes, and included class II histocompatability antigens, the pro-inflammatory cytokine osteopontin, complement components, proteinases and inhibitors, galectins, osteonectin/SPARC, and prostaglandin D2 synthase. The results are consistent with a model of neurodegeneration that includes inflammation as a factor leading to the precipitous loss of neurons in individuals with these disorders."

TS disease is a GM2 gangliosidosis attributed to the deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme beta-hexosaminidase A (HexA) (beta-N-acetylhexosaminidase, EC ). The hypothesis is that transduced cells overexpressing and secreting large amounts of the enzyme would lead to a measurable activity in defective cells via a secretion-recapture mechanism. We transduced NIH3T3 murine fibroblasts with the LalphaHexTN retroviral vector carrying the cDNA encoding for the human Hex alpha-subunit. The Hex activity in the medium from transduced cells was approximately 10-fold higher (up to 75 milliunits) than observed in non-transduced cells. TS cells were cultured for 72 h in the presence of the cell medium derived from the transduced NIH3T3 cells, and they were analyzed for the presence and catalytic activity of the enzyme. Although TS cells were able to efficiently uptake a large amount of the soluble enzyme, the enzyme failed to reach the lysosomes in a sufficient quantity to hydrolyze the GM2 ganglioside to GM3 ganglioside. Thus, our results showed that delivery of the therapeutic HexA was not sufficient to correct the phenotype of TS cells."

Kidney dysfunction might be correlated with changes in sulfatides, the major acidic glycosphingolipids in this organ. To elucidate their in vivo metabolic pathway these compounds were analyzed in mice afflicted with inherited glycosphingolipid disorders. The mice under study lacked the genes encoding either beta-hexosaminidase alpha-subunit (Hexa-/-), the beta-hexosaminidase beta-subunit (Hexb-/-), both beta-hexosaminidase alpha and beta-subunits (Hexa-/- and Hexb-/-), GD3 synthase (GD3S-/-), GD3 synthase and GalNAc transferase (GD3S-/- and GalNAcT-/-), GM2 activator protein (Gm2a-/-), or arylsulfatase A (ASA-/-). Quantification of the sulfatides, I(3)SO(3)(-)-GalCer (SM4s), II(3)SO(3)(-)-LacCer (SM3), II(3)SO(3)(-)-Gg(3)Cer (SM2a), and IV(3,) II(3)-(SO(3)(-))(2)-Gg(4)Cer (SB1a), was performed by nano-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry. We conclude for the in vivo situation in mouse kidneys that: 1) a single enzyme (GalNAc transferase) is responsible for the synthesis of SM2a and GM2 from SM3 and GM3, respectively. 2) In analogy to GD1a, SB1a is degraded via SM2a. 3) SM2a is hydrolyzed to SM3 by beta-hexosaminidase S (Hex S) and Hex A, but not Hex B. Both enzymes are supported by GM2-activator protein. 4) Arylsulfatase A is required to degrade SB1a. It is probably the sole sphingolipid-sulfatase cleaving the galactosyl-3-sulfate bond. In addition, a human Tay-Sachs patient's liver was investigated, which showed accumulation of SM2a along with GM2 storage. The different ceramide compositions of both compounds indicated they were probably derived from different cell types. These data demonstrate that in vivo the sulfatides of the ganglio-series follow the same metabolic pathways as the gangliosides with the replacement of sulfotransferases and sulfatases by sialyltransferases and sialidases. Furthermore, a novel neutral GSL, IV(6)GlcNAcbeta-Gb(4)Cer, was found to accumulate only in Hexa-/- and Hexb-/- mouse kidneys. From this we conclude that Hex S also efficiently cleaves terminal beta1-6-linked HexNAc residues from neutral GSLs in vivo."

    "abstract": "In recent years, mouse models for human metabolic diseases have become commonplace because the information gained from in vivo study of biochemical pathways is invaluable, and many metabolic diseases are relatively easy to recreate in mice through gene knockout technology in embryonic stem cells. In certain cases, however, the knockout mice may reproduce only some of the human disease phenotype, may be more severely affected than human cases, or may have no clinical phenotype at all. Under these circumstances, the disease pathology can become more complex, causing the researcher to evaluate basic differences in mouse and human biology as well as questions of genetic background, alternate pathways, and possible gene interactions. This review is a brief analysis of gene knockout models for Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, Lowe syndrome, X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, Fabry disease, galactosemia, glycogen storage disease type II, metachromatic leukodystrophy, and Tay-Sachs disease, which produce a biochemical model of disease but often do not reproduce clinical symptoms. These mice may be useful for studying the biochemical and physiological pathways in which certain metabolites function toward embryonic and fetal development, as well as specific functions in various organs, and they may provide an inexpensive and useful model system for development of new therapeutic techniques."

For diagnosis, these enzymes are usually measured in plasma or extracts of leukocytes. We describe methods for the assay of hexosaminidase A and total hexosaminidase activities in dried blood spots (DBSs) on filter paper. We studied 163 healthy controls, 9 Tay-Sachs patients, 4 Sandhoff patients, 18 obligate carriers and the newborn-screening cards from two patients with Tay-Sachs and one patient with Sandhoff disease.

The described methodology is useful to distinguish patients with Tay-Sachs disease or Sandhoff disease from carriers and controls using samples that are sufficiently stable to be transported to the testing laboratory by mail. The diagnosis of both diseases from a newborn-screening card (NSC) was clearly demonstrated, even after storage for up to 38 months at room temperature.

Inclusions such as membranous cytoplasmic bodies (MCB) and zebra bodies were seen in neurons of Tay-Sachs (TS) model mice, Sandhoff's disease (SD) model mice, and double knockout (DKO) mice. However, the cerebral perivascular macrophages discovered by Mato are active in the uptake of waste products and regarded as scavenger cells under steady-state conditions. We observed that indigestible components derived from neurons were taken up by the perivascular macrophages of TS mice by pinocytosis, but those of SD and DKO mice contained only pale inclusions and had marked vacuolations, and pinocytosis was rarely observed. Histochemically, the inclusions in the perivascular macrophages of TS mice were positive for the PAS stain, but those of SD and DKO mice were negative. In addition, the perivascular cells of TS mice expressed clear positive immunoreactivity against BM-8 and F4/80, but those of DKO mice had very weak BM-8 and F4/80 immunoreactivity. These differences between TS, SD, and DKO mice are based on their metabolism of oligosaccharides and glycosaminoglycans (GAG). Thus, hexosaminidase B is more important for keeping normal morphology and function of perivascular macrophages than hexosaminidase A. The foamy cells that appeared along the cerebral microvessels in lipidosis and saccharidosis were identified as perivascular macrophages (Mato's fluorescent granular perithelial cells: FGP cells)."

    "abstract": "In mammalian tissues, the pathway known for the catabolism of G(M1) [Galbeta3GalNAcbeta4(Neu5Acalpha3)Galbeta4GlcCer; where Cer is ceramide] is the conversion of this ganglioside into G(M2) [GalNAcbeta4(Neu5Acalpha3)Galbeta4GlcbetaCer] by beta-galactosidase followed by the conversion of G(M2) into G(M3) (Neu5Acalpha3Galbeta4GlcbetaCer) by beta-N-acetylhexosaminidase A (Hex A). However, the question of whether or not G(M1) and G(M2) can also be respectively converted into asialo-G(M1) (Galbeta3GalNAcbeta4Galbeta4GlcCer; G(A1)) and asialo-G(M2) (GalNAcbeta4Galbeta4GlcbetaCer, G(A2)) by mammalian sialidases has not been resolved. This is due to the fact that sialidases purified from mammalian tissues always contained detergents that interfered with the in vitro hydrolysis of G(M1) and G(M2) in the presence of an activator protein. The mouse model of human type B Tay-Sachs disease created by the disruption of the Hexa gene showed no neurological abnormalities, with milder clinical symptoms than the human counterpart, and the accumulation of G(M2) in the brains of affected mice was only limited to certain regions [Sango, Yamanaka, Hoffmann, Okuda, Grinberg, Westphal, McDonald, Crawley, Sandhoff, Suzuki and Proia (1995) Nat. Genet. 11, 170-176]. These results suggest the possible presence of an alternative catabolic pathway (the G(A2) pathway) in mouse to convert G(M2) into G(A2) by sialidase. To show the existence of this pathway, we have used recombinant mammalian cytosolic sialidase and membrane-associated sialidase to study the desialylation of G(M1) and G(M2). We found that the mouse membrane-bound sialidase was able to convert G(M1) and G(M2) into their respective asialo-derivatives in the presence of human or mouse G(M2) activator protein. The cytosolic sialidase did not exhibit this activity. Our results suggest that, in vivo, the stable NeuAc of G(M1) and G(M2) may be removed by the mammalian membrane-associated sialidase in the presence of G(M2) activator protein. They also support the presence of the G(A2) pathway for the catabolism of G(M2) in mouse."

    "abstract": "Tay-Sachs disease is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by progressive neurologic degeneration, fatal in early childhood. In the Ashkenazi Jewish population the disease incidence is about 1 in every 3,500 newborns and the carrier frequency is 1 in every 29 individuals. Carrier screening programs for Tay-Sachs disease have reduced disease incidence by 90% in high-risk populations in several countries. The Brazilian Jewish population is estimated at 90,000 individuals. Currently, there is no screening program for Tay-Sachs disease in this population. To evaluate the importance of a Tay-Sachs disease carrier screening program in the Brazilian Jewish population by determining the frequency of heterozygotes and the acceptance of the program by the community. Laboratory of Molecular Genetics--Institute of Biosciences--Universidade de São Paulo. 581 senior students from selected Jewish high schools. Molecular analysis of Tay-Sachs disease causing mutations by PCR amplification of genomic DNA, followed by restriction enzyme digestion. Among 581 students that attended educational classes, 404 (70%) elected to be tested for Tay-Sachs disease mutations. Of these, approximately 65% were of Ashkenazi Jewish origin. Eight carriers were detected corresponding to a carrier frequency of 1 in every 33 individuals in the Ashkenazi Jewish fraction of the sample. The frequency of Tay-Sachs disease carriers among the Ashkenazi Jewish population of Brazil is similar to that of other countries where carrier screening programs have led to a significant decrease in disease incidence. Therefore, it is justifiable to implement a Tay-Sachs disease carrier screening program for the Brazilian Jewish population."

    "abstract": "Several studies have shown that Ashkenazi Jews in the United States and Israel have a high prevalence of the founder mutations BRCA1 185delAG, BRCA1 5382insC, BRCA2 6174delT, and APC I1307K at frequencies of 1.0--1.1%, 0.2--0.3%, 0.6--1.4%, and 6.1--7.0%, respectively. The objective of this study was to compare the prevalence of these alleles in the Australian Jewish population with that of U.S. Jews. Australian Jews have a different history of migration, with less opportunity for changes in allele frequency due to conversion or intermarriage with non-Jewish Australians. The results obtained therefore can be used to assess whether U.S. data can be generalized to other Jewish populations. SUBJECTS AND METHODS. Subject samples were ascertained through a screening program for Tay-Sachs disease as part of a community-based screening program in New South Wales and Victoria. DNA extracted from 1200 deidentified blood samples was tested using amplification refractory mutation system polymerase chain reaction. The allele frequencies found were as follows: BRCA1 185delAG 1.25% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.62--1.88%), BRCA1 5382insC 0.25% (95% CI, 0--0.53%), BRCA2 6174delT 1.08% (95% CI, 0.50--1.67%), and APC I1307K 8.67% (95% CI, 7.07--10.26%). The prevalence of breast carcinoma predisposition alleles therefore is greater than 2.5% in Australian Ashkenazim. There were no significant differences between the allele frequencies in Australian Ashkenazim and those identified in other studies with similar ascertainment strategies, despite the different migration patterns of Australian Jews. This suggests the broad applicability of the U.S. and Israeli data, not only to Australian Ashkenazim, but also to Ashkenazi communities throughout the world."

    "abstract": "Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), the loss of mRNAs carrying premature stop codons, is a process by which cells recognize and degrade nonsense mRNAs to prevent possibly toxic effects of truncated peptides. Most mammalian nonsense mRNAs are degraded while associated with the nucleus, but a few are degraded in the cytoplasm; at either site, there is a requirement for translation and for an intron downstream of the early stop codon. We have examined the NMD of a mutant HEXA message in lymphoblasts derived from a Tay-Sachs disease patient homozygous for the common frameshift mutation 1278ins4. The mutant mRNA was nearly undetectable in these cells and increased to approximately 40% of normal in the presence of the translation inhibitor cycloheximide. The stabilized transcript was found in the cytoplasm in association with polysomes. Within 5 h of cycloheximide removal, the polysome-associated nonsense message was completely degraded, while the normal message was stable. The increased lability of the polysome-associated mutant HEXA mRNA shows that NMD of this endogenous mRNA occurred in the cytoplasm. Transfection of Chinese hamster ovary cells showed that expression of an intronless HEXA minigene harboring the frameshift mutation or a closely located nonsense codon resulted in half the normal mRNA level. Inclusion of multiple downstream introns decreased the abundance further, to about 20% of normal. Thus, in contrast to other systems, introns are not absolutely required for NMD of HEXA mRNA, although they enhance the low-HEXA-mRNA phenotype."

    "abstract": "The glycosphingolipid (GSL) lysosomal storage diseases are caused by mutations in the genes encoding the glycohydrolases that catabolize GSLs within lysosomes. In these diseases the substrate for the defective enzyme accumulates in the lysosome and the stored GSL leads to cellular dysfunction and disease. The diseases frequently have a progressive neurodegenerative course. The therapeutic options for treating these diseases are relatively limited, and for the majority there are no effective therapies. The problem is further compounded by difficulties in delivering therapeutic agents to the brain. Most research effort to date has focused on strategies for augmenting enzyme levels to compensate for the underlying defect. These include bone marrow transplantation (BMT), enzyme replacement and gene therapy. An alternative strategy that we have been exploring is substrate deprivation. This approach aims to balance the rate of GSL synthesis with the impaired rate of GSL breakdown. The imino sugar N-butyldeoxynojirimycin (NB-DNJ) inhibits the first step in GSL biosynthesis and has been used to evaluate this approach. Studies in an asymptomatic mouse model of Tay-Sachs disease have shown that substrate deprivation prevents GSL storage in the CNS. In a severe neurodegenerative mouse model of Sandhoff disease, substrate deprivation delayed the onset of symptoms and disease progression and significantly increased life expectancy. Combining NB-DNJ and BMT was found to be synergistic in the Sandhoff mouse model. A clinical trial in type I Gaucher disease has been undertaken and has shown beneficial effects. Efficacy was demonstrated on the basis of significant decreases in liver and spleen volumes, gradual but significant improvement in haematological parameters and disease activity markers, together with diminished GSL biosynthesis and storage as determined by independent biochemical assays. Further trials in type I Gaucher disease are in progress; studies are planned in patients with GSL storage in the CNS."

    "abstract": "The mechanism of plasma membrane trafficking and degradation is still poorly understood. This investigation deals with the biogenesis of lysosomes during endocytic flow in Marshall cells and in various cell types of the male reproductive system. Marshall cells were exposed to ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) and leupeptin after labeling with cationic ferritin. In some experiments, the treated cells were immunogold labeled with anti-prosaposin antibody. NH4Cl and leupeptin are lysosomotropic agents that affect the endosomal-lysosomal progression. Testes, efferent ducts and epididymis from mouse mutants with defects affecting plasma membrane degradation were also used to analyze this process. NH4Cl produced a retention of cationic ferritin in endosomes and hindered the endosomal/lysosomal progression. Leupeptin did not affect this process. NH4Cl decreased the labeling of prosaposin in endosomes and lysosomes, while leupeptin increased the labeling of prosaposin in lysosomes. The number of lysosomes per cytoplasmic area was higher in treated cells than in controls. These findings suggest that leupeptin affected lysosomes whereas NH4Cl affected both endosomes and lysosomes. The endosomal and lysosomal accumulation of prosaposin induced by the treatment with NH4Cl and leupeptin indicated that the site of entry of prosaposinwas both the lysosome and endosome. Electron microscopy (EM) of tissues from mouse mutants with defects affecting plasma membrane degradation substantiated these observations. The EM analysis revealed a selective accumulation of multivesicular bodies (MVBs) and the disappearance of lysosomes, in testicular fibroblasts, nonciliated cells of the efferent ducts and principal cells of the epididymis, suggesting that MVBs are precursors of lysosomes. (1) endosomes and MVBs are a required steps for degradation of membranes; (2) endosomes and MVBs are precursors of lysosomes; and (3) endosomes, MVBs, and lysosomes appear to be transient organelles."

    "abstract": "In humans, beta-hexosaminidase A (alphabeta) is required to hydrolyze GM2 ganglioside. A deficiency of either the alpha- or beta-subunit leads to a severe neurological disease, Tay-Sachs or Sandhoff disease, respectively. In mammals beta-hexosaminidase B (betabeta) and S (alphaalpha) are other major and minor isozymes. The primary structures of the alpha- and beta-subunits are 60% identical, but only the alpha-containing isozymes can efficiently hydrolyze beta-linked GlcNAc-6-SO(4) from natural or artificial substrates. Hexosaminidase has been grouped with glycosidases in family 20. A molecular model of the active site of the human hexosaminidase has been generated from the crystal structure of a family 20 bacterial chitobiase. We now use the chitobiase structure to identify residues close to the carbon-6 oxygen of NAG-A, the nonreducing beta-GlcNAc residue of its bound substrate. The chitobiase side chains in the best interactive positions align with alpha-Asn(423)Arg(424) and beta-Asp(453)Leu(454). The change in charge from positive in alpha to negative in beta is consistent with the lower K(m) of hexosaminidase S, and the much higher K(m) and lower pH optimum of hexosaminidase B, toward sulfated versus unsulfated substrates. In vitro mutagenesis, CHO cell expression, and kinetic analyses of an alphaArg(424)Lys hexosaminidase S detected little change in V(max) but a 2-fold increase in K(m) for the sulfated substrate. Its K(m) for the nonsulfated substrate was unaffected. When alphaAsn(423) was converted to Asp, again only the K(m) for the sulfated substrate was changed, increasing by 6-fold. Neutralization of the charge on alphaArg(424) by substituting Gln produced a hexosaminidase S with a K(m) decrease of 3-fold and a V(max) increased by 6-fold for the unsulfated substrate, parameters nearly identical to those of hexosaminidase B at pH 4.2. As well, for the sulfated substrate at pH 4.2 its K(m) was increased 9-fold and its V(max) decreased 1.5-fold, values very similar to those of hexosaminidase B obtained at pH 3.0, where its betaAsp(453) becomes protonated."

It is characterized by severe central nervous system involvement.

Four patients, aged 24-29 years, with chronic GM2-gangliosidosis were examined prospectively for evidence of peripheral and autonomic nervous system dysfunction. All had nerve conduction studies, sympathetic skin responses and cardiac monitoring during the head tilt-table test. Three patients had objective evidence of autonomic dysfunction with abnormal sympathetic nervous skin responses and axonal sensorimotor polyneuropathy. None of the patients had evidence of significant cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction on the head tilt-table test. The peripheral and autonomic nervous system may be involved in patients with chronic GM2-gangliosidosis. In some cases, this may be clinically significant. On the other hand, cardiovascular autonomic instability is apparently not a significant problem in young adult patients with the disease."

We assembled a primer thiolated oligonucleotide, complementary to the target DNA as far as one base before the mutation site, on an electrode or a gold-quartz piezoelectric crystal. After hybridizing the target DNA, normal or mutant, with the sensing oligonucleotide, the resulting assembly is reacted with the biotinylated nucleotide, complementary to the mutation site, in the presence of polymerase. The labeled nucleotide is coupled only to the double-stranded assembly that includes the mutant site. Subsequent binding of avidin-alkaline phosphatase to the assembly, and the biocatalyzed precipitation of an insoluble product on the transducer, provides a means to confirm and amplify detection of the mutant. Faradaic impedance spectroscopy and microgravimetric quartz-crystal microbalance analyses were employed for electronic detection of single-base mutants. The lower limit of sensitivity for the detection of the mutant DNA is 1 x 10-14 mol/ml. We applied the method for the analysis of polymorphic blood samples that include the Tay-Sachs genetic disorder. The sensitivity of the method enables the quantitative analysis of the mutant with no PCR pre-amplification."

These diseases are caused by mutations in the genes coding for enzymes involved in GSL catabolism and are characterised by the accumulation of GSL substrates within the lysosomes of cells. The aim of substrate reduction therapy is to inhibit the rate of synthesis of GSLs to levels where the residual activity of the mutant catabolic enzyme is sufficient to prevent pathological storage. In this review we discuss the development of N-butyldeoxynojirimycin (NB-DNJ), an imino sugar that inhibits the ceramide-specific glucosyltransferase which catalyses the first committed step of GSL synthesis. This agent has been shown to slow accumulation of stored glycolipid in an in vitro model of Gaucher's disease and in knockout mouse models of Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff diseases. Furthermore, administration of NB-DNJ to Sandhoff mice delays the onset of neurological disease and also slows its progression. We discuss safety and efficacy data from the clinical trial of substrate reduction with NB-DNJ which has been undertaken in patients with Type 1 Gaucher's disease. This trial provides a proof-of-principle for the use of this approach in a wide range of GSL lysosomal storage diseases."

Employing both enzymatic and molecular methods (for optimal sensitivity and specificity) more than 1400 couples have been identified to be at-risk for TSD in their offspring, i.e., both parents heterozygotes. Through prenatal testing of more than 3200 pregnancies, births of over 600 infants with this uniformly fatal neurodegenerative disease have been prevented. In the United States and Canada, the incidence of TSD in the Jewish population has been reduced by more than 90%. More that 100 mutations in the hexosaminidase A gene (the TSD locus) have been identified to date. Some are associated with later onset or more chronic forms of neuronal storage disease. Two mutations cause a carrier-like \"pseudo-deficiency\" when enzymatic testing is used (false positives). A number of practical, social, and ethical complexities have been identified in this prototypic population-based effort. Educational and counseling components must be provided both before and after screening. Issues of privacy and confidentiality of test results must be addressed. In certain cultures insurability and employment may be involved. The public perception of the biomedical community as advocates for wide-scale testing and screening may be interpreted, in some systems, as conflicts of interest on the part of entrepreneurial scientists, clinicians, and institutions. Many new opportunities for population-based screening will be evident in this era of genome-related discovery. Accordingly, some of the experiences with Tay-Sachs disease prevention may be instructive."

In recent years the program has utilized the biochemical assay for the determination of hexosaminidase A levels by the heat inactivation technique as well as by direct DNA analysis. The three mutations which were analyzed were those that have been shown to be prevalent among AJ TSD patients and carriers, namely the four nucleotide insertion mutation in exon 11 (1278+TATC), the splice mutation at the 5' end of intron 12 (1421+1g-->c), and the adult mutation, a Gly(269)-->Ser substitution in exon 5 (G269S). A total of 103,133 individuals were tested by biochemical analysis, and 38,197 of them were also assayed by DNA testing. Furthermore, 151 chromosomes from TSD patients or obligate heterozygotes were subjected to DNA analysis for one of the three mutations. DNA testing of the latter identified one of the three AJ mutations in every case, predicting a very high detection rate of heterozygotes in this community by this method. By contrast, the sensitivity of the enzyme assay ranged from 93.1% to 99.1% depending on the exclusion (inclusion) of inconclusive results as positive, while the specificity ranged from 88.1% to 98.8% depending on the inclusion (exclusion) of inconclusive results as positive. Our results strongly support the use of DNA testing alone as the most cost-effective and efficient approach to carrier screening for TSD in individuals of confirmed Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry."

The Madison Community Tay-Sachs Screening Program (MCTSSP) is a collaborative, interdisciplinary program that organizes and conducts periodic screening for Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) for the purpose of identifying Tay-Sachs carriers. We present and analyze data on carrier detection with regard to various demographics, including family history of TSD, ancestry, gender, medication exposure, and illness. Individuals participating in the MCTSSP between 1978 and 1999 were primarily of the target population, and the carrier rate was within the expected range (1/25). Despite aggressive publicity efforts and a well-established program, attendance at the screens has declined. A recent survey of Jewish undergraduate students at the University of Wisconsin-Madison showed poor recall of family screen history and carrier status and reinforced the perception that utilization of the Madison screening program has been low.

Heritable deficiency of this enzyme results in various forms of GalNAc-beta(1,4)-[N-acetylneuraminic acid (2,3)]-Gal-beta(1,4)-Glc-ceramide gangliosidosis, including Tay-Sachs disease. We have determined the x-ray crystal structure of a beta-hexosaminidase from Streptomyces plicatus to 2.2 A resolution (Protein Data Bank code ). beta-Hexosaminidases are believed to use a substrate-assisted catalytic mechanism that generates a cyclic oxazolinium ion intermediate. We have solved and refined a complex between the cyclic intermediate analogue N-acetylglucosamine-thiazoline and beta-hexosaminidase from S. plicatus to 2.1 A resolution (Protein Data Bank code ). Difference Fourier analysis revealed the pyranose ring of N-acetylglucosamine-thiazoline bound in the enzyme active site with a conformation close to that of a (4)C(1) chair. A tryptophan-lined hydrophobic pocket envelopes the thiazoline ring, protecting it from solvolysis at the iminium ion carbon. Within this pocket, Tyr(393) and Asp(313) appear important for positioning the 2-acetamido group of the substrate for nucleophilic attack at the anomeric center and for dispersing the positive charge distributed into the oxazolinium ring upon cyclization. This complex provides decisive structural evidence for substrate-assisted catalysis and the formation of a covalent, cyclic intermediate in family 20 beta-hexosaminidases."

It has been postulated that GM2-AP extracts single GM2 molecules from membranes and presents them in soluble form to beta-hexosaminidase A for cleavage of N-acetyl-d-galactosamine and conversion to GM3. The high affinity of GM2-AP for GM2 is based on specfic recognition of the oligosaccharide moiety as well as the ceramide lipid tail. Genetic defects in GM2-AP result in an atypical form of Tay-Sachs disease known as variant AB GM2 gangliosidosis. The 2.0 A resolution crystal structure of GM2-AP reported here reveals a previously unobserved fold whose main feature is an eight-stranded cup-shaped anti-parallel beta-pleated sheet. The striking feature of the GM2-AP structure is that it possesses an accessible central hydrophobic cavity rather than a buried hydrophobic core. The dimensions of this cavity (12 Ax14 Ax22 A) are suitable for binding 18-carbon lipid acyl chains. Flexible surface loops and a short alpha-helix decorate the mouth of the beta-cup and may control lipid entry to the cavity."

    "title": "Screening for genetic disorders among Jews: how should the Tay-Sachs screening program be continued?",
    "abstract": "The screening program in Israel for Tay-Sachs disease has proven very successful, giving Jewish couples a choice not to have affected children. The technology of carrier detection is now possible in several other severe genetic diseases that are relatively frequent among Jews. Due to the current confusion, a policy is needed to determine how the TSD screening program should be continued in the Israeli Jewish population. We propose that such a screening program include only mutations agreed by consensus as causing a disease severe enough to warrant the possibility of therapeutic abortion. We also propose that general screening include only mutations that are relatively frequent, taking into account the carrier frequencies in the Israeli Jewish population."

These pathological structures seem to be homologous to the whorls observed in retinas of human carriers of Tay-Sachs disease. This disease, a genetic disorder, is found in humans and some mammals. Our findings in fish suggest that the gene responsible can be found throughout the vertebrate evolutionary tree, possibly dormant in most taxa."

    "abstract": "Pyramidal cells initiate the formation of dendritic arbors in a prolific burst of neurite outgrowth during early cortical development. Although morphologically mature pyramidal neurons do not normally sprout additional primary dendrites, the discovery of ectopic dendritogenesis in neuronal storage diseases has revealed that these cells do retain this ability under appropriate stimulation. The capacity for renewal of dendritogenesis has been found to exhibit a species gradient with human > cat, dog, sheep > mouse. A consistent metabolic feature of ectopic dendrite-bearing pyramidal neurons is a heightened intracellular expression of GM2 ganglioside. Elevated expression of this same glycosphingolipid has also been found to correlate with normal dendritogenesis. Immature neurons in developing cat and ferret cortex exhibit high levels of GM2 ganglioside immunoreactivity coincident with normal dendritic sprouting and a similar relationship has now been shown for human cortical development. Ultrastructural studies of all three species revealed GM2 localized to vesicles in a manner consistent with Golgi synthesis and exocytic trafficking to the somatic-dendritic plasmalemma. We propose that GM2 ganglioside functions in glycosphingolipid-enriched microdomains (lipid rafts) in the plasmalemma to promote dendritic initiation through modulation of specific membrane proteins and/or their associated second messenger cascades."

    "abstract": "Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) is caused by mutation of the HEXA gene, which results in a deficiency of the alpha-subunit of hexosaminidase A. The major mutation in Japanese TSD is a G-to-T transversion at the 3'-splice site of intron 5. We established a fluorescent competitive allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (FCAS-PCR) method for detection of the mutation and applied it to prenatal diagnosis of a Japanese TSD family. FCAS-PCR distinguished the wild and mutant alleles clearly, with broad ranges in the amount of template DNA, the dNTP concentration, the MgCl2 concentration and the number of PCR cycles. After obtaining ethics committee approval and informed consent from the parents in the index family, chorionic villus sampling was performed. FCAS-PCR analysis using chorionic villus DNA disclosed that the fetus was homozygous for the mutation. To confirm the diagnosis, direct sequencing analysis of the genomic PCR fragment was performed, and showed the same results as those of the FCAS-PCR analysis. FCAS-PCR proved to be helpful for carrier screening and prenatal diagnosis in TSD families in the Japanese population. It would also be a useful DNA-diagnostic method for many other inherited disorders."

Respondents cited the rapidity of changes in genetic testing as the greatest obstacle to providing genetic information to patients. Obstetricians' knowledge of inheritance and test selection pertaining to single-gene disorders was more limited than that for aneuploidy and neural tube defects.

    "title": "Biogenesis of lysosomes by endocytic flow of plasma membrane.",
    "abstract": "The objective of this review is to examine the biogenesis of lysosomes during the endocytic flow of plasma membrane. Two models have been proposed to explain the formation of lysosomes by this process: the \"maturational\" and the \"stationary\" models. According to the former, pinocytotic vesicles fuse among themselves to yield endosomes, which in turn, transform first into multivesicular bodies (MVB) and then into mature lysosomes. Therefore, endosomes and lysosomes would be transient organelles. On the other hand, the \"stationary\" model proposes that the endocytic pathway is formed by functionally and physically distinct compartments. Cultured cells exposed to ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) and leupeptin after a pulse of cationic ferritin were recently used to freeze endosomes and lysosomes. NH4Cl produced a retention of cationic ferritin in endosomes, indicating that this agent interfered with the endosomal/lysosomal progression. Leupeptin did not affect this process. The number of lysosomes increased in cells treated with both lysosomotropic agents. Thus, NH4Cl affected the endosomal and lysosomal compartments, whereas leupeptin had a preferential effect on lysosomes. Mice mutants with defects of plasma membrane degradation, including a Tay-Sachs model, a Sandhoff disease model, as well as, mice with the inactivated prosaposin gene were used to analyze the biogenesis of lysosomes. Thin sections of mutant cells were examined under the electron microscope, and the analysis revealed a selective accumulation of MVBs and the disappearance of lysosomes, suggesting that the formation of MVBs is a required step in lysosomal maturation and that the intravesicular content of MVBs is necessary for the digestion of plasma membrane components. Taken together, these data indicate that endosomes and MVBs are preceding steps in lysosomal biogenesis and that endosomes, MVBs, and lysosomes are transient organelles."

    "abstract": "An increased frequency of carriers of 1:140, as defined by reduced hexosaminidase A (HexA) activity, was observed among Iraqi Jews participating in the Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) carrier detection program. Prior to this finding, TSD among Jews had been restricted to those of Eastern European (Ashkenazi) and Moroccan descent with carrier frequencies of 1:29 and 1:110 for Jews of Ashkenazi and Moroccan extraction, respectively. A general, pan-ethnic frequency of approximately 1:280 has been observed among other Jewish Israeli populations. Analysis of 48 DNA samples from Iraqi Jews suspected, by enzymatic assay, to be carriers revealed a total of five mutations, one of which was novel. In nine carriers (19%), a known mutation typical to either Ashkenazi or Moroccan Jews was identified. DeltaF304/ 305 was detected in four individuals, and + 1278TATC in three. G269S and R170Q each appeared in a single person. The new mutation, G749T, resulting in a substitution of glycine to valine at position 250 has been found in 19 of the DNA samples (40%). This mutation was not detected among 100 non-carrier, Iraqi Jews and 65 Ashkenazi enzymatically determined carriers. Aside from Ashkenazi and Moroccan Jews, a specific mutation in the HEXA gene has now also been identified in Jews of Iraqi descent."

    "abstract": "Tay-Sachs or Sandhoff disease results from a deficiency of either the alpha- or the beta-subunits of beta-hexosaminidase A, respectively. These evolutionarily related subunits have been grouped with the \"Family 20\" glycosidases. Molecular modeling of human hexosaminidase has been carried out on the basis of the three-dimensional structure of a bacterial member of Family 20, Serratia marcescens chitobiase. The primary sequence identity between the two enzymes is only 26% and restricted to their active site regions; therefore, the validity of this model must be determined experimentally. Because human hexosaminidase cannot be functionally expressed in bacteria, characterization of mutagenized hexosaminidase must be carried out using eukaryotic cell expression systems that all produce endogenous hexosaminidase activity. Even small amounts of endogenous enzyme can interfere with accurate K(m) or V(max) determinations. We report the expression, purification, and characterization of a C-terminal His(6)-tag precursor form of hexosaminidase B that is 99.99% free of endogenous enzyme from the host cells. Control experiments are reported confirming that the kinetic parameters of the His(6)-tag precursor are the same as the untagged precursor, which in turn are identical to the mature isoenzyme. Using highly purified wild-type and Arg(211)Lys-substituted hexosaminidase B, we reexamine the role of Arg(211) in the active site. As we previously reported, this very conservative substitution nevertheless reduces k(cat) by 500-fold. However, the removal of all endogenous activity has now allowed us to detect a 10-fold increase in K(m) that was not apparent in our previous study. That this increase in K(m) reflects a decrease in the strength of substrate binding was confirmed by the inability of the mutant isozyme to efficiently bind an immobilized substrate analogue, i.e., a hexosaminidase affinity column. Thus, Arg(211) is involved in substrate binding, as predicted by the chitobiase model, as well as catalysis."

The majority of protocols focus on cancer therapy and monogenic diseases. By now, still there is more unfulfilled expectation than clinically sound achievements, since no effective prevention or successful treatment for genetic diseases or cancer have been developed. Germline genetic modification is considered as the treatment of choice for such a diseases like retinoblastoma. Tay-Sachs, Lesch-Nyhan and metachromatic leuko-dystrophy. This approach which is still illegal or prohibited by rules in many European countries, is gathering more and more advocates. Once we learn how to control gene expression the perspectives for clinical application of gene therapy might be enormous. The safety of genetic modification of gametes or embryonal stem cells remains to be properly addressed and successfully solved. The ethical issues of germinal gene therapy are still the subject of controversial opinions among the scientists, lawyers and philosophers."

    "abstract": "Nearly 100% of infantile Tay-Sachs disease is produced by two mutations occurring in the alpha chain of the lysosomal enzyme beta-N-acetylhexosaminidase (HEXA) in the Ashkenazi Jewish population. Although others have described primer systems used to amplify both sites simultaneously, few discuss the allele dropout problems inherent in this test. Our goal was to construct a more robust test enabling stronger signal generation for single cell preimplantation genetic diagnosis and to investigate the occurrence of allele dropout. New nested primers were designed to optimize detection of both major Tay-Sachs mutations. Four hundred fifty-seven single cells, including normal cells and those carrying mutations of either the 4bp insertion exon 11 or splice-site intron 12 defects, were used to screen a new primer system. Based on PCR amplified product analysis, total efficiency of amplification was 85.3%, (390/457). The allele dropout rate for the 4bp insertion mutation in exon 11 and splice-site mutation in intron 12 was 4.8% and 5.8%, respectively. Multiple mutation detection and analysis within the Tay-Sachs disease gene (HEXA) is possible using single cells for clinical preimplantation genetic diagnosis. Alternative PCR primers and conditions offer various methods for developing systems compatible to specific program requirements."

Cells and tissues were obtained from five patients with LINCL, two with variant type NCL, three with other lysosomal storage diseases, and eight control subjects. Two antibodies were raised against N- and C-terminal peptide fragments of the normal product of the CLN2 gene. The authors examined the possibility of diagnosis of LINCL with immunostaining and immunoblotting using specific antibodies made of the recently identified defective gene in LINCL. Immunoreactivity with these antibodies showed the absence or marked reduction of CLN2 immunoreactivity in the lymphocytes, lymphoblasts, and fibroblasts of all five patients with LINCL examined. These results indicate the usefulness of this diagnostic method based on the changes in CLN2 immunoreactivity. This relatively simple, specific, and cost-effective method is a promising diagnostic tool for this disease, although additional studies are necessary."

However, abnormal neurological findings, especially cognitive impairment, were commoner among TSD carriers (47.4 vs. 26.2%, p = 0.04).

Despite a history of endogamy over the past 2000 yr, the historical record suggests that there was admixture with Ashkenazi and Sephardic Jews during the Middle Ages. To determine whether Roman and Ashkenazi Jews shared common signature mutations, we tested a group of 107 Roman Jews, representing 176 haploid sets of chromosomes. No mutations were found for Bloom syndrome, BRCA1, BRCA2, Canavan disease, Fanconi anemia complementation group C, or Tay-Sachs disease. Two unrelated individuals were positive for the 3849 + 10C->T cystic fibrosis mutation; one carried the N370S Gaucher disease mutation, and one carried the connexin 26 167delT mutation. Each of these was shown to be associated with the same haplotype of tightly linked microsatellite markers as that found among Ashkenazi Jews. In addition, 14 individuals had mutations in the familial Mediterranean fever gene and three unrelated individuals carried the factor XI type III mutation previously observed exclusively among Ashkenazi Jews. These findings suggest that the Gaucher, connexin 26, and familial Mediterranean fever mutations are over 2000 yr old, that the cystic fibrosis 3849 + 10kb C->T and factor XI type III mutations had a common origin in Ashkenazi and Roman Jews, and that other mutations prevalent among Ashkenazi Jews are of more recent origin."

In comparison to the control, SMA and Tay-Sachs biopsies, we observed in the ALS samples a significant about two-fold lower activity of complex I of mitochondrial respiratory chain. To visualise the distribution of the mitochondrial defect in skeletal muscle fibers we applied confocal laser-scanning microscopy and video fluorescence microscopy of NAD(P)H and fluorescent flavoproteins. The redox change of mitochondrial NAD(P)H and flavoproteins on addition of mitochondrial substrates, ADP, or cyanide were determined by measurement of fluorescence intensities with dual-photon UV-excitation and single-photon blue excitation. In skeletal muscle fibers of ALS patients with abnormalities of mitochondrial DNA (multiple deletions, n=1, or lower mtDNA levels, n=14) we observed a heterogeneous distribution of the mitochondrial defects among individual fibers and even within single fibers. In some patients (n=3) a mitochondrial defect was also detectable in cultivated skin fibroblasts. These findings support the viewpoint that the observed impairment of mitochondrial function in muscle of certain ALS patients is caused by an intrinsic mitochondrial defect which may be of pathophysiological significance in the etiology of this neurodegenerative disease."

    "abstract": "Beta-hexosaminidase (Hex) is a lysosomal enzyme that exists as two isoenzymes: Hex A (subunit structure alphabeta) and Hex B (betabeta). Its presence in the testis and epididymis suggests important roles for Hex and its substrates in male fertility and reproductive functions. Disruption of the Hexa gene encoding the alpha-subunit of Hex has led to the generation of a mildly affected mouse model of human Tay-Sachs disease, allowing us the opportunity to analyze the effects of isolated Hex A deficiency on epithelial cellular morphology of the male reproductive tract. At 5 weeks and at 3, 5, and 12 months, the testes, efferent ducts and epididymides of Hex A-deficient (Hexa -/-) and wild-type (Hexa +/+) mice were perfuse fixed and analyzed by routine light and electron microscopy as well as with immunocytochemistry employing antibodies to lysosomal enzymes. In the testis, the seminiferous epithelium of Hexa -/- mice appeared comparable to that of wild-type mice in appearance and topographical arrangement of its cell types at all ages examined. Also, no differences were noted for the efferent ducts. In contrast, there were striking abnormalities in the epididymides of the mutant mice; however, the abnormalities were mainly restricted to the initial segment and intermediate zone. Principal cells of these regions at 5 weeks showed a dramatic increase in the number of lysosomes as compared with those from wild-type animals, and this progressed with increasing age. Furthermore, unlike the few small lysosomes present in wild-type mice, those of Hexa -/- mice were at times enlarged and often filled the supranuclear and basal regions of these cells. In the light microscope, large, dense cellular aggregates were noted at the base of the epithelium in the proximal initial segment that corresponded in the electron microscope to two different cell types, both of which increased in size with age. One aggregate was considered to belong to narrow cells on the basis of the presence of numerous cup-shaped vesicles characteristic of these cells; they appeared to be dislocated from the upper half of the epithelium. In the distal initial segment and intermediate zone, narrow cells were readily identified, but rather than being slender as in the control animals, they were greatly enlarged and filled with pale lysosomes in mutant mice. The second type of cellular aggregate noted in the proximal initial segment corresponded to halo cells. They contained numerous small and large lysosomes and small, Golgi-related, dense, core granules characteristic of halo cells. On the basis of the large size of these cells, they appeared to be actively internalizing substances from the intercellular space. In contrast, principal and clear cells of the caput, corpus, and cauda regions did not appear to show a significant increase in number or size of lysosomes as compared with those of wild-type animals. All structures identified as lysosomes in the various cell types were immunoreactive for cathepsin D. The present data thus reveal that isolated Hex A deficiency results in region- and cell-specific abnormalities in the epididymis but in no apparent abnormalities in the testis or efferent ducts. Specific roles for Hex A that cannot be compensated for by other isozymes of Hex appear to exist within lysosomes of epithelial cells predominantly of the initial segment and intermediate zone. Taken together, the results also suggest that the inability to degrade endocytosed substrates normally acted upon by Hex A in lysosomes of principal and narrow cells leads to their accumulation, eventual fusion, and increased size."

    "abstract": "The hydrolysis of GM2-ganglioside is unusual in its requirements for the correct synthesis, processing, and ultimate combination of three gene products. Whereas two of these proteins are the alpha- (HEXA gene) and beta- (HEXB) subunits of beta-hexosaminidase A, the third is a small glycolipid transport protein, the GM2 activator protein (GM2A), which acts as a substrate specific co-factor for the enzyme. A deficiency of any one of these proteins leads to storage of the ganglioside, primarily in the lysosomes of neuronal cells, and one of the three forms of GM2-gangliosidosis, Tay-Sachs disease, Sandhoff disease or the AB-variant form. Studies of the biochemical impact of naturally occurring mutations associated with the GM2 gangliosidoses on mRNA splicing and stability, and on the intracellular transport and stability of the affected protein have provided some general insights into these complex cellular mechanisms. However, such studies have revealed little in the way of structure-function information on the proteins. It appears that the detrimental effect of most mutations is not specifically on functional elements of the protein, but rather on the proteins' overall folding and/or intracellular transport. The few exceptions to this generalization are missense mutations at two codons in HEXA, causing the unique biochemical phenotype known as the B1-variant, and one codon in both the HEXB and GM2A genes. Biochemical characterization of these mutations has led to the localization of functional residues and/or domains within each of the encoded proteins."

    "abstract": "Tay-Sachs disease is an inborn lysosomal disease characterized by excessive cerebral accumulation of GM2. The catabolism of GM2 to GM3 in man requires beta-hexosaminidase A (HexA) and a protein cofactor, the GM2 activator. Thus, Tay-Sachs disease can be caused by the deficiency of either HexA or the GM2 activator. The same cofactor found in mouse shares 74.1% amino acid identity (67% nucleotide identity) with the human counterpart. Between the two activators, the mouse GM2 activator can effectively stimulate the hydrolysis of both GM2 and asialo-GM2 (GA2) by HexA and, to a lesser extent, also stimulate HexB to hydrolyze GA2, whereas the human activator is ineffective in stimulating the hydrolysis of GA2 (Yuziuk, J. A., Bertoni, C., Beccari, T., Orlacchio, A., Wu, Y.-Y., Li, S.-C., and Li, Y.-T. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 66-72). To understand the role of these two activators in stimulating the hydrolyses of GM2 and GA2, we have constructed human/mouse chimeric GM2 activators and studied their specificities. We have identified a narrow region (Asn(106)-Tyr(114)) in the mouse cDNA sequence that might be responsible for stimulating the hydrolysis of GA2. Replacement of the corresponding site in the human sequence with the specific mouse sequence converted the ineffective human activator into an effective chimeric protein for stimulating the hydrolysis of GA2. This chimeric activator protein, like the mouse protein, is also able to stimulate the hydrolysis of GA2 by HexB. The mouse model of human type B Tay-Sachs disease recently engineered by the targeted disruption of the Hexa gene showed less severe clinical manifestation than found in human patients. This has been considered to be the result of the catabolism of GM2 via converting it to GA2 and further hydrolysis of GA2 to lactosylceramide by HexB with the assistance of mouse GM2 activator protein. The chimeric activator protein that bears the characteristics of the mouse GM2 activator may therefore be able to induce an alternative catabolic pathway for GM2 in human type B Tay-Sachs patients."

During a brief pulse-chase experiment, the fluorescent lipid accumulated in the lysosomes of fibroblasts from patients with Fabry's disease, GM1 gangliosidosis, GM2 gangliosidosis (Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff forms), metachromatic leucodystrophy, mucolipidosis type IV, Niemann-Pick disease (types A, B, and C), and sphingolipid-activator-protein-precursor (prosaposin) deficiency.

This method may be useful as an initial general screen for lipid-storage diseases, and, with modification, could be used for large-scale automated screening of drugs to abrogate lysosomal storage in various lipidoses. The unexpected accumulation of BODIPY-LacCer in several biochemically distinct diseases raises important questions about common mechanisms of cellular dysfunction in these disorders."

In the last decade, the cloning of the HEXA gene and the identification of more than 80 associated TSD-causing mutations has permitted molecular diagnosis in many instances. TSD was the first genetic condition for which community-based screening for carrier detection was implemented. As such, the TSD experience can be viewed as a prototypic effort for public education, carrier testing, and reproductive counseling for avoiding fatal childhood disease. More importantly, the outcome of TSD screening over the last 28 years offers convincing evidence that such an effort can dramatically reduce incidence of the disease."

Four mutations have been identified, but the human gene structure has been only partially characterized. We report a new patient from a Laotian deme whose cells are deficient in both GM2-activator mRNA and protein. However, reverse transcription (RT)-PCR detected some normal-sized cDNA and a smaller cDNA species, which was not seen in the RT-PCR products from normal controls. Sequencing revealed that, although the patient's normal-sized cDNA contained a single nonsense mutation in exon 2, his smaller cDNA was the result of an in-frame deletion of exon 2. Long PCR was used to amplify introns 1 and 2 from patient and normal genomic DNA, and no differences in size, in 5' and 3' end sequences, or in restriction-mapping patterns were observed. From these data we developed a set of four PCR primers that can be used to identify GM2A mutations. We use this procedure to demonstrate that the patient is likely homozygous for the nonsense mutation. Other reports have associated nonsense mutations with dramatically reduced levels of mRNA and with an increased level of skipping of the exon containing the mutation, thus reestablishing an open reading frame. However, a recent article has concluded that, in some cases, the latter observation is caused by an artifact of RT-PCR. In support of this conclusion, we demonstrate that, if the competing, normal-sized cDNA is removed from the initial RT-PCR products, from both patient and normal cells, by an exon 2-specific restriction digest; a second round of PCR produces similar amounts of exon 2-deleted cDNA."

    "abstract": "The past 3 decades have witnessed impressive progress in our understanding of inherited neurometabolic diseases, promoted by the rapid development and application of molecular genetic strategies. Such progress has required the juxtaposition of clinical evaluations and basic science techniques. The central role of careful and complete assessment of affected children cannot be overemphasized and in no way has been diminished by technologic advances. Indeed, enhanced clinical and laboratory evaluations have led to important conceptual advances. Molecular genetics has elucidated those disorders with known metabolic defects through functional cloning and explained the variability of disease expression based on specific mutational events. Alternatively, positional cloning has identified molecular defects for those disorders with clear phenotypic patterns, but lacking a defined metabolic abnormality. Regarding heterogeneous expression, disorders with clearly different phenotypes can arise from different mutations within the same gene. The multiple variants of beta-hexosaminidase deficiency (Tay-Sachs disease) are, arguably, the best examples. Conversely, disorders with similar phenotypes are explainable by quite different mutational events. In addition, the identification of specific diseases exhibiting both biochemical abnormalities and disturbed organogenesis has blurred conventional dogma regarding separation of genetic disorders into strict metabolic and structural categories. Disorders of peroxisomal function and the neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses are prototypes for the points noted above and raise important issues regarding our approaches to children with these disorders. These issues include a high index of suspicion for an inherited neurometabolic disease and an open mind to possible interrelations with other known and seemingly dissimilar conditions."

    "abstract": "Tay-Sachs disease is a severe, inherited disease of the nervous system caused by accumulation of the brain lipid GM2 ganglioside. Mouse models of Tay-Sachs disease have revealed a metabolic bypass of the genetic defect based on the more potent activity of the enzyme sialidase towards GM2. To determine whether increasing the level of sialidase would produce a similar effect in human Tay-Sachs cells, we introduced a human sialidase cDNA into neuroglia cells derived from a Tay-Sachs fetus and demonstrated a dramatic reduction in the accumulated GM2. This outcome confirmed the reversibility of GM2 accumulation and opens the way to pharmacological induction or activation of sialidase for the treatment of human Tay-Sachs disease."

    "abstract": "The severe neurodegenerative disorder, Tays-Sachs disease, is caused by a beta-hexosaminidase alpha-subunit deficiency which prevents the formation of lysosomal heterodimeric alpha-beta enzyme, hexosaminidase A (HexA). No treatment is available for this fatal disease; however, gene therapy could represent a therapeutic approach. We previously have constructed and characterized, in vitro, adenoviral and retroviral vectors coding for alpha- and beta-subunits of the human beta-hexosaminidases. Here, we have determined the in vivo strategy which leads to the highest HexA activity in the maximum number of tissues in hexA -deficient knock-out mice. We demonstrated that intravenous co-administration of adenoviral vectors coding for both alpha- and beta-subunits, resulting in preferential liver transduction, was essential to obtain the most successful results. Only the supply of both subunits allowed for HexA overexpression leading to massive secretion of the enzyme in serum, and full or partial enzymatic activity restoration in all peripheral tissues tested. The enzymatic correction was likely to be due to direct cellular transduction by adenoviral vectors and/or uptake of secreted HexA by different organs. These results confirmed that the liver was the preferential target organ to deliver a large amount of secreted proteins. In addition, the need to overexpress both subunits of heterodimeric proteins in order to obtain a high level of secretion in animals defective in only one subunit is emphasized. The endogenous non-defective subunit is otherwise limiting."

    "abstract": "Two novel mutations of the beta-hexosaminidase alpha subunit gene were identified in Japanese patients with the infantile form of Tay-Sachs disease. One mutation was a one-base deletion at nt613C, which generated a stop codon at two codons downstream, in three unrelated patients. The other mutation was a one-base substitution of G-to-A at IVS 5, +1, which caused a splicing abnormality, in one patient. A missense mutation of R170W, which has already been reported in other ethnic groups, was also newly identified in one patient. In 1993, the most common mutation (IVS 5, -1G-->T) in Japanese patients with Tay-Sachs disease was reported as the major mutation in Japan accounting for 80% of 56 mutant alleles from 28 unrelated patients. The deletion of nt613C was the second most common mutation, accounting for 5% of the mutant alleles. The previously reported mutation IVS 5, -1G-->T and the nt613C deletion found in this study together accounted for 85% of the mutations causing Tay-Sachs disease among Japanese. Since these two mutations were located in or close to exon 6 and since they abolish Fok I (IVS 5, -1G-->T) and Sfa NI (nt613C deletion) restriction sites, respectively, they were screened rapidly by single polymerase chain reaction followed by digestion with these enzymes."

    "abstract": "The hypothesis offered here is that many different illnesses could be treated by slowing the synthesis of glucosphingolipids (GSLs) with a suitable inhibitor. In people with inadequate hydrolases for the GSLs (e.g. Gaucher's disease), the lipids accumulate to a pathological degree. It should be possible to eliminate the accumulation by slowing the synthesis of the GSLs to match the ability of the patient to degrade them. In people with cancer, the tumors secrete excessive amounts of GSLs, which block the ability of the immune system to attack the tumor cells. By blocking the synthesis of tumor GSLs, it should be possible to enable the patient to generate antibodies and activated T cells that can destroy the tumor. Tumors exhibiting multidrug resistance may do so by synthesizing GSLs even faster than usual. It should be possible to restore the sensitivity of the tumor to anti-cancer drugs by inhibiting their synthesis of GSLs. Metastasis of tumors also appears to require the formation of GSLs, so an inhibitor should help block tumor dissemination. Diabetics tend to have high levels of blood glucose, which acts to stimulate kidney growth via more rapid synthesis of GSLs. This pathological growth can be blocked by inhibiting the formation of kidney GSLs. Viruses, bacteria, and bacterial toxins have been found to bind to specific GSLs of human and animal cells. Presumably, this binding leads to the damaging process of infection. It should be possible to treat such infections by depleting the host's body of its GSLs."

    "abstract": "Two juvenile sibling male Muntjak deer (Muntiacus muntjak) with histories of depression, ataxia, circling and visual deficits were studied. Cerebrospinal fluid analyses revealed vacuolated macrophages that contained long parallel needle-like intracytoplasmic inclusions. Light microscopically, nerve cell bodies throughout the brain, ganglion cells within the retina and neurons in the myenteric plexuses were variably swollen and had pale granular to finely vacuolated eosinophilic cytoplasm. Neuronal cytoplasm stained specifically with sudan black and Luxolfast blue stains. Within the brain there were occasional axonal spheroids, foci of astrogliosis and scattered microglial cells with abundant pale foamy cytoplasm. Electron microscopy of the brain and retina revealed numerous neurons and ganglion cells, respectively, with multiple membrane-bound structures that contained compact electron-dense membranous whorls and fewer parallel membranous stacks. Thin layer chromatography of total lipid extracts of the cerebral cortex of both cases revealed massive accumulation of G(M2) ganglioside. Crude kidney extracts of the two affected deer were able to hydrolyze 4-methylumbelliferyl beta-GlcNAc, but not 4-methylumbelliferyl beta-GlcNAc-6-sulfate, indicating the defect of beta-hexosaminidase A. Cellogel electrophoresis of the kidney extracts also revealed the deficiency of beta-hexosaminidase A in the two deer. It is concluded that these two deer had the biochemical lesion identical to that of human type B G(M2) gangliosidosis (classical Tay-Sachs disease)."

If Tay-Sachs disease, diabetes, hemophilia, cystic fibrosis, Huntington's disease or other genetic diseases can be cured or prevented by \"gene surgery,\" then it is certainly permitted in Jewish law. Genetic premarital screening is encouraged in Judaism for the purpose of discouraging at-risk marriages for a fatal illness such as Tay-Sachs disease. Neonatal screening for treatable conditions such as phenylketonuria is certainly desirable and perhaps required in Jewish law. Preimplantation screening and the implantation of only \"healthy\" zygotes into the mother's womb to prevent the birth of an affected child are probably sanctioned in Jewish law. Whether or not these assisted reproduction techniques may be used to choose the sex of one's offspring, to prevent the birth of a child with a sex-linked disease such as hemophilia, has not yet been ruled on by modern rabbinic decisions. Prenatal screening with the specific intent of aborting an affected fetus is not allowed according to most rabbinic authorities, although a minority view permits it \"for great need.\" Not to have children if both parents are carriers of genetic diseases such as Tay-Sachs is not a Jewish option. Preimplantation screening is preferable. All screening test results must remain confidential. Judaism does not permit the alteration or manipulation of physical traits and characteristics such as height, eye and hair color, facial features and the like, when such change provides no useful benefit to mankind. On the other hand, it is permissible to clone organisms and microorganisms to facilitate the production of insulin, growth hormone, and other agents intended to benefit mankind and to cure and treat diseases."

Following transplantation into germinal zones of the newborn mouse brain they participate in aspects of normal development, including migration along established migratory pathways to disseminated central nervous system regions, differentiation into multiple developmentally and regionally appropriate cell types, and nondisruptive interspersion with host progenitors and their progeny. These human NSCs can be genetically engineered and are capable of expressing foreign transgenes in vivo. Supporting their gene therapy potential, secretory products from NSCs can correct a prototypical genetic metabolic defect in neurons and glia in vitro. The human NSCs can also replace specific deficient neuronal populations. Cryopreservable human NSCs may be propagated by both epigenetic and genetic means that are comparably safe and effective. By analogy to rodent NSCs, these observations may allow the development of NSC transplantation for a range of disorders."

    "abstract": "The heterozygote frequency of Gaucher disease (GD) and Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) is distinctly high among Ashkenazi Jews (1:29 for TSD and 1:16 for GD). Two main theories have been suggested to explain this high occurrence: a founder effect with subsequent genetic drift, and a selective advantage of heterozygotes. We compared the frequency of the GD most common mutation (1226A-->G) among carriers of the common TSD mutation (+1277 TATC) with the frequency of this mutation in the general Ashkenazi population. The frequency of GD carriers among 308 TSD heterozygotes was 1:28 which is about half the expected (P = 0.03). These results indicate that carriers of both diseases do not possess additional evolutionary advantage over single mutation carriers. A reasonable interpretation of these findings is that one or both mutations have arisen relatively recently in different regions of Europe and have not yet reached genetic equilibrium."

They are relatively rare diseases, but are frequently severe in terms of their pathology. Many involve progressive neurodegeneration, and in the most severe forms result in death in early infancy. The therapeutic options for treating these diseases are limited, and for the majority of these disorders there are currently no therapies available. To date, most research has focused on correcting the genetic lesion by gene therapy or by augmenting the enzyme activity deficient in these patients by introducing fully functional enzyme. This can be achieved by bone marrow transplantation or intravenous infusion of purified or recombinant enzyme (enzyme replacement). Gene therapy and enzyme replacement therapy are disease specific, and pharmacological approaches for the treatment of these disorders have not been fully explored. In this commentary, the problems associated with disease therapy are discussed, and a pharmacological agent (N-butyldeoxynojirimycin) is presented for the potential generic treatment of this family of disorders. Successful prevention of glycosphingolipid storage in a mouse model of Tay-Sachs disease suggests that this strategy merits clinical evaluation."

Uptake of the glycolipid with apolipoprotein E-coated liposomes was linear with time and with the amount of glycolipid added. In normal cells, the expected array of less polar products and some lipids resulting from re-using the liberated sphingosine, mainly sphingomyelin and phosphatidylcholine, were formed. In alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase-deficient cells, the glycolipid was virtually not degraded; product formation was less than 2% of the normal control rate, suggesting that blood group A-active glycolipids contribute as storage compounds to the pathogenesis of this disease. The expected accumulation of degradation intermediates was seen in fucosidosis, and in Sandhoff, Gaucher, and Farber disease cells, whereas normal turnover rates were found in Tay-Sachs disease cells, G(M2) activator-deficient (variant AB of G(M2) gangliosidosis) and in sulfatide activator- (sap-B-) deficient cells.

    "abstract": "Glycosphingolipids form cell type-specific patterns on the surface of eukaryotic cells. Degradation of glycosphingolipids requires endocytic membrane flow of plasma membrane-derived glycosphingolipids into the lysosomes as the digesting organelles. The inherited deficiencies of lysosomal hydrolases and of sphingolipid activator proteins both give rise to sphingolipid storage diseases. Recent research has focused on the mechanisms leading to selective membrane degradation in the lysosomes and on the mechanism and physiological function of sphingolipid activator proteins. The GM2-degrading system is a paradigm for activator protein-dependent lysosomal degradation. Three polypeptide chains contribute to the in vivo degradation of ganglioside GM2: the alpha- and beta-chains of the beta-hexosaminidases and the GM2 activator. Mouse models of Tay-Sachs disease (alpha-chain deficiency), Sandhoff disease (beta-chain deficiency) and GM2 activator deficiency have been described. While the phenotypes of these variants of GM2-gangliosidoses are only slightly different in humans, the animal models show drastic differences in severity and course of the diseases. The reason for this is the specificity of sialidase, which is different between mouse and human. A double-knockout mouse lacking beta-hexosaminidases A, B and S shows a phenotype of mucopolysaccharidosis and gangliosidosis. A substrate deprivation approach to therapy is discussed with respect to animal models of the GM2-gangliosidoses."

Higher oligosaccharide homologues contain additional neutral and acidic oligosaccharides. Among these are gangliosides that have 1 or more molecules of N-acetylneuraminic acid.

Although the active site associated with the hydrolysis of GM2 ganglioside, as well as part of the binding site for the ganglioside-activator complex, is associated with the alpha-subunit, elements of the beta-subunit are also involved. Missense mutations in these genes normally result in the mutant protein being retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and degraded. The mutations associated with the B1-variant of Tay-Sachs are rare exceptions that directly affect residues in the alpha-active site. We have previously reported two sisters with chronic Sandhoff disease who were heterozygous for the common HEXB deletion allele. Cells from these patients had higher than expected levels of mature beta-protein and residual Hex A activity, approximately 20%. We now identify these patients' second mutant allele as a C1510T transition encoding a beta-Pro504 --> Ser substitution. Biochemical characterization of Hex A from both patient cells and cotransfected CHO cells demonstrated that this substitution (a) decreases the level of heterodimer transport out of the endoplasmic reticulum by approximately 45%, (b) lowers its heat stability, (c) does not affect its Km for neutral or charged artificial substrates, and (d) lowers the ratio of units of ganglioside/units of artificial substrate hydrolyzed by a factor of 3. We concluded that the beta-Pro504 --> Ser mutation directly affects the ability of Hex A to hydrolyze its natural substrate but not its artificial substrates. The effect of the mutation on ganglioside hydrolysis, combined with its effect on intracellular transport, produces chronic Sandhoff disease."

    "abstract": "One of the most profound events in the life of a neuron in the mammalian CNS is the development of a characteristic dendritic tree, yet little is understood about events controlling this process. Pyramidal neurons of the cerebral cortex are known to undergo a single explosive burst of dendritic sprouting immediately after completing migration to the cortical mantle, and following maturation there is no evidence that new, primary dendrites are initiated. Yet in one group of rare genetic diseases--Tay-Sachs disease and related neuronal storage disorders--cortical pyramidal neurons undergo a second period of dendritogenesis. New dendritic membrane is generated principally at the axon hillock and in time is covered with normal-appearing spines and synapses. In our studies of normal brain development and storage diseases we consistently find one feature in common in cortical pyramidal neurons undergoing active dendritogenesis: They exhibit dramatically increased expression of GM2 ganglioside localized to cytoplasmic vacuoles within neuronal perikarya and proximal dendrites. There is also evidence that the increase in GM2 precedes dendritic spouting, and that after dendritic maturation is complete (in normal brain) the GM2 levels in neurons become substantially reduced. These findings are consistent with GM2 ganglioside playing a pivotal role in the regulation of dendritogenesis in cortical pyramidal neurons."

The enzyme is also present in sperm and has been postulated to be required for fertilization. To better understand the role of Hex in reproduction, we have examined the testes and epididymides of mouse models of human Tay Sachs and Sandhoff diseases, produced by targeted disruption of the Hexa (alpha-subunit) or Hexb (beta-subunit) genes, respectively, encoding the enzymes Hex A (structure, alphabeta) and Hex B (betabeta). Testis weight, morphology, and sperm counts were unaffected in Hex-deficient mice. In the epididymis of the Hex A-deficient Hexa-/- mice, there was a large increase in the size and number of lysosomes in the initial segment/intermediate zone. In Hexb-/- mice (Hex A and B-deficient), the epididymal defects were much more extensive and the cytoplasm of all cell types throughout the efferent ducts and epididymis was filled with pale, uncondensed, enlarged lysosomes. In contrast to the brain where GM2 ganglioside accumulates, both mutant mice accumulated two non-GM2 gangliosides in the epididymis. The major accumulated species was characterized by electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. The Hexa-/- male mice were fertile; however, litter sizes were reduced. The Hexb-/- males were able to sire normal sized litters up to nine weeks of age and remained healthy until 16-20 weeks of age. The extensive abnormalities in the Hexb-/- mice, in contrast to region-specific effects in the Hexa-/-mice, indicate an important and novel role for the Hex B isozyme in the epididymis and a region-specific role for Hex A in the initial segment/intermediate zone. In contrast to other reports, our results indicate that Hex is not essential for fertilization in young adult male mice. To explain the extensive epididymal abnormalities in the Hexb-/- mice, we propose that substrates for Hex, such as testis-derived glycolipids, cannot be catabolized and accumulate in lysosomes, leading to epididymal dysfunction and abnormalities in the epididymal luminal environment that supports sperm maturation."

Less severe, subacute (juvenile-onset) and chronic (adult-onset) variants are characterized by a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations and are associated with residual levels of Hex A enzyme activity. We identified a 1422 G-->C (amino acid W474C) substitution in the first position of exon 13 of HEXA of a non-Jewish proband who manifested a subacute variant of G(M2) gangliosidosis. On the second maternally inherited allele, we identified the common infantile disease-causing 4-bp insertion, +TATC 1278, in exon 11. Pulse-chase analysis using proband fibroblasts revealed that the W474C-containing alpha-subunit precursor was normally synthesized, but not phosphorylated or secreted, and the mature lysosomal alpha-subunit was not detected. When the W474C-containing alpha-subunit was transiently co-expressed with the beta-subunit to produce Hex A (alphabeta) in COS-7 cells, the mature alpha-subunit was present, but its level was much lower than that from normal alpha-subunit transfections, although higher than in those cells transfected with an alpha-subunit associated with infantile TSD. Furthermore, the precursor level of the W474C alpha-subunit was found to accumulate in comparison to the normal alpha-subunit precursor levels. We conclude that the 1422 G-->C mutation is the cause of Hex A enzyme deficiency in the proband. The resulting W474C substitution clearly interferes with alpha-subunit processing, but because the base substitution falls at the first position of exon 13, aberrant splicing may also contribute to Hex A deficiency in this proband."

Because no treatment is available for this disease, we have investigated the possibility of enzymatic correction of HexA-deficient cells by HEXA gene transfer. Human HEXA cDNA was subcloned into a retroviral plasmid generating to G.HEXA vector. The best Psi-CRIP producer clone of G.HEXA retroviral particles was isolated, and murine HexA-deficient fibroblasts derived from hexa -/- mice were transduced with the G.HEXA vector. Transduced cells overexpressed the alpha-chain, resulting in the synthesis of interspecific HexA (human alpha-chain/murine beta-chain) and in a total correction of HexA deficiency. The alpha-chain was secreted in the culture medium and taken up by HexA-deficient cells via mannose-6-phosphate receptor binding, allowing for the restoration of intracellular HexA activity in non-transduced cells."

    "abstract": "The GM2 gangliosidoses are a group of heritable neurodegenerative disorders caused by excessive accumulation of the ganglioside GM2 owing to deficiency in beta-hexosaminidase activity. Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff diseases have similar clinical phenotypes resulting from a deficiency in human hexosaminidase alpha and beta subunits, respectively. The lack of treatment for GM2 gangliosidoses stimulated interest in developing animal models to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the various forms of this disease and to test new potential therapies. In this review, we discuss the molecular biology of GM2 gangliosidoses and the different strategies that have been tested in animal models for the treatment of this genetic disorder, including gene transfer and cell engraftment of neural stem cells engineered to express the hexosaminidase isoenzymes."

The three clinical forms of the disorders (infantile, juvenile and adult) are of varying severity and onset, and have been correlated with the amount of residual GM2 ganglioside-degrading activity present in patients' cells. Through targeted disruption of the murine beta-hexosaminidase genes in embryonic stem cells, we have developed a set of mice that vary in their GM2 ganglioside-degrading capacity and exhibit many of the clinical features of the human diseases. These mice are valuable for the study of pathogenic mechanisms and for devising novel therapeutic strategies in these disorders."

    "abstract": "By late 1993, the genes for cystic fibrosis and Gaucher disease and the mutations common among Ashkenazi Jews had been identified. In response to these advances, heterozygote screening for cystic fibrosis and Gaucher disease was added to the more than 20-year-old Tay-Sachs disease screening program at New York University Medical Center, New York, NY. To review the outcomes from the first 1000 patients screened through this program. Patients and their referring physicians were informed about the new carrier tests. At the time of screening, patients could choose their tests (hexosaminidase A by enzyme analysis for Tay-Sachs disease or mutation analysis for cystic fibrosis and Gaucher disease). All partners of Tay-Sachs and cystic fibrosis carriers were tested. Prenatal diagnosis was offered and performed for carrier couples or mixed-marriage couples in whom the Ashkenazi Jewish partner was a carrier of Gaucher disease. Outcomes were measured by: (1) choice of tests, (2) decisions regarding prenatal diagnosis, and (3) phenotypes of children born to patients who underwent screening. The majority of Ashkenazi Jewish patients chose to have testing for all 3 diseases. If they previously underwent screening for Tay-Sachs disease, then they chose to undergo testing for cystic fibrosis and Gaucher disease. All carrier couples for each of these diseases went on to have prenatal testing. All mixed-marriage couples in whom the Jewish partner was found to be a carrier for Gaucher disease chose to have prenatal diagnosis. One fetus was identified as having cystic fibrosis. Since the program was initiated, no Ashkenazi Jewish baby has been born with any of these diseases at New York University Medical Center. New tests can be readily incorporated into established heterozygote screening programs. The Ashkenazi Jewish population described herein tends to choose testing for all conditions for which heterozygote screening is available."

Psychosis is reported in 30% to 50% of adult-onset patients, and many are misdiagnosed with schizophrenia. Mood disorders are present in more than 25% and cognitive impairment in more than 20%. Treatment of psychosis with neuroleptics may not have a favorable risk/benefit ratio, but treatment with benzodiazepines or electroconvulsive therapy may be efficacious. Metabolic diseases such as gangliosidosis are probably under-recognized as causes of neuropsychiatric illness.

    "abstract": "Various neuronal degenerative diseases are characterized by late onset, relentless progression, and finally death. Many have a direct genetic basis; others are of still unknown etiological mechanisms [1,2]. The study of human neurodegenerative diseases is complicated by the difficulty of obtaining tissue samples at various stages of progression, especially early in the course of the disease. Since neurodegeneration occurs in many organisms [3-5], model organisms amenable to genetic and molecular techniques, such as the mouse, offer important advantages. Much less laborious and expensive are worms or flies, which have short generation times and can be rapidly screened for mutations. To investigate the use of the fly as a model system for identifying genes related to such diseases, we screened for mutants having reduced lifespan, then examined them for brain degeneration. We describe here two such mutants, each with a different pattern of degeneration as characterized by light and transmission electron microscopy. The brain of the aging spongecake mutant exhibits regionally specific, membrane-bound vacuoles similar to those seen in spongiform degenerations such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease [6,7]. The mutant eggroll develops dense, multilamellated structures in the brain, resembling ones found in lipid storage diseases such as Tay-Sachs [8]."

    "abstract": "Glycosphingolipids are ubiquitous membrane components of eukaryotic cells. They participate in various cell recognition events and can regulate enzymes and receptors within the plasma membrane. Sphingolipidoses are due to an impaired lysosomal digestion of these substances. Glycosphingolipids are degraded by the action of exohydrolases, which are supported, in the case of glycosphingolipids with short oligosaccharide chains, by sphingolipid activator proteins. Five sphingolipid activator proteins are known so far, the GM2-activator and the SAPs, SAP-A to D (also called saposins). Degradation of glycosphingolipids requires endocytic membrane flow of plasma membrane derived glycosphingolipids into the lysosomes. Recent research focused on the topology of this process and on the mechanism and physiological function of sphingolipid activator proteins. Limited knowledge is available about enzymology and topology of glycosphingolipid biosynthesis. Recently, intermediates of this metabolic pathway have been identified as novel signalling molecules. Inhibition of glycosphingolipid biosynthesis has been shown to be beneficial in the animal model of Tay-Sachs disease. Mice with disrupted genes for lysosomal hydrolases and activator proteins are useful models for known human diseases and are valuable tools for the study of glycosphingolipid metabolism, the pathogenesis of sphingolipidoses and novel therapeutic approaches."

    "abstract": "Tay-Sachs disease, an inborn lysosomal disease featuring a buildup of GM2 in the brain, is caused by a deficiency of beta-hexosaminidase A (Hex A) or GM2 activator. Of the two human lysosomal Hex isozymes, only Hex A, not Hex B, cleaves GM2 in the presence of GM2 activator. In contrast, mouse Hex B has been reported to be more active than Hex A in cleaving GM2 (Burg, J., Banerjee, A., Conzelmann, E., and Sandhoff, K. (1983) Hoppe Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 364, 821-829). In two independent studies, mice with the targeted disruption of the Hexa gene did not display the severe buildup of brain GM2 or the concomitant abnormal behavioral manifestations seen in human Tay-Sachs patients. The results of these two studies were suggested to be attributed to the reported GM2 degrading activity of mouse Hex B. To clarify the specificity of mouse Hex A and Hex B and to better understand the observed results of the mouse model of Tay-Sachs disease, we have purified mouse liver Hex A and Hex B and also prepared the recombinant mouse GM2 activator. Contrary to the findings of Burg et al., we found that the specificities of mouse Hex A and Hex B toward the catabolism of GM2 were not different from the corresponding human Hex isozymes. Mouse Hex A, but not Hex B, hydrolyzes GM2 in the presence of GM2 activator, whereas GM2 is refractory to mouse Hex B with or without GM2 activator. Importantly, we found that, in contrast to human GM2 activator, mouse GM2 activator could effectively stimulate the hydrolysis of GA2 by mouse Hex A and to a much lesser extent also by Hex B. These results provide clear evidence on the existence of an alternative pathway for GM2 catabolism in mice by converting GM2 to GA2 and subsequently to lactosylceramide. They also provide the explanation for the lack of excessive GM2 accumulation in the Hexa gene-disrupted mice."

The frequency of detected carriers was 1:21 for TSD, 1 :25 for CF, and 1:18 for GD. Twenty-one carriercoupleswere identified, counseled, and all postconception couples opted for prenatal diagnosis. Pre-education and posteducation questionnaires revealed that patients initially knew little about the diseases, but acquired disease information and increased knowledge of genetic concepts. Education and genetic counseling increased understanding and retention of genetic concepts and disease-related information, and minimized test-related anxiety. Although individuals sought screening for all 3 diseases, reproductive attitudes and decisions varied directly with disease severity and treatability. These findings emphasize the importance of genetic counseling for prenatal carrier testing and may improve understanding, acceptance, and informed decision making for prenatal carrier screening for multiple genetic diseases."

    "title": "Gangliosides and autoimmune diabetes.",
    "abstract": "Gangliosides are sialic acid-containing glycolipids which are formed by a hydrophobic portion, the ceramide, and a hydrophilic part, i.e. the oligosaccharide chain. First described in neural tissue, several studies have shown that gangliosides are almost ubiquitous molecules expressed in all vertebrate tissues. Within cells, gangliosides are usually associated with plasma membranes, where they can act as receptors for a variety of molecules and have been shown to take part in cell-to-cell interaction and in signal transduction. In addition, gangliosides are expressed in cytosol membranes like those of secretory granules of some endocrine cells (adrenal medulla, pancreatic islets). As far as the role of gangliosides in diseases is concerned, there are some cases in which an aberrant ganglioside expression plays a crucial role in the disease pathogenetic process. These diseases include two major forms of ganglioside storage, namely GM2-gangliosidosis (Tay-Sachs and its beta-hexosaminidase deficiency) and GM1-gangliosidosis (beta-galactosidase deficiency), where the most prominent pathological characteristic is the lysosomal ganglioside accumulation in neurons. Other inflammatory or degenerative diseases both within and outside the nervous system have been shown to be associated with an altered pattern of ganglioside expression in the target organ. Since monoclonal antibodies have been discovered and used in immunology, a large variety of ganglioside antigens has been described both as blood group antigens and as tumour-related antigens. Several studies have also indicated that gangliosides can act not only as antigens, but also as autoantigens. As a matter of fact, auto-antibodies to gangliosides, detected by immunostaining methods performed directly on TLC plates or by ELISA, have been described in several autoimmune disorders such as Guillain-Barré syndrome, multiple sclerosis, lupus erythematosus, Hashimoto's thyroiditis and, last but not least, insulin-dependent (type 1) diabetes mellitus. This last disease is caused by the autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing pancreatic islet cells in genetically predisposed individuals. Autoantibodies and T lymphocytes directed towards multiple islet autoantigens have been detected in the circulation, well before the clinical onset of the disease, in a prodromal phase during which pancreatic islet beta-cells are presumably destroyed. Among the target autoantigens, some are of protein nature but others are acidic glycolipids such as sulphatides158 and the gangliosides GT3, GD3 and especially GM2-1. This last component is specifically expressed in pancreatic islets and has been shown to represent a target of IgG autoantibodies highly associated with diabetes development in first-degree relatives of type 1 diabetic individuals. In addition, the GM2-1 ganglioside appears to be one of the antigens recognized by cytoplasmic ICA, a heterogeneous group of antibodies which specifically react with islets on pancreatic frozen sections. In conclusion, studies performed in the last decade have clearly indicated that gangliosides represent a heterogeneous class of molecules that are involved in several cellular processes that are of crucial importance in physiological as well as in pathological conditions. Interestingly, these molecules, despite their small size, have been shown to represent not only important antigens in tumour immunology but are also able to elicit a specific autoimmune response, thus representing important autoantigens in some autoimmune disorders. It is of interest that, in addition to neurological autoimmune disorders where autoimmunity to gangliosides is frequent and usually of considerable magnitude, an autoimmune response to this class of molecules has been observed in autoimmune diabetes.

    "abstract": "Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff diseases are autosomal recessive neurodegenerative diseases resulting from the inability to catabolize GM2 ganglioside by beta-hexosaminidase A (Hex A) due to mutations of the alpha subunit (Tay-Sachs disease) or beta subunit (Sandhoff disease) of Hex A. Hex B (beta beta homodimer) is also defective in Sandhoff disease. We previously developed mouse models of both diseases and showed that Hexa-/- (Tay-Sachs) mice remain asymptomatic to at least 1 year of age while Hexb-/- (Sandhoff) mice succumb to a profound neurodegenerative disease by 4-6 months of age. Here we find that neuron death in Hexb-/- mice is associated with apoptosis occurring throughout the CNS, while Hexa-/- mice were minimally involved at the same age. Studies of autopsy samples of brain and spinal cord from human Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff diseases revealed apoptosis in both instances, in keeping with the severe expression of both diseases. We suggest that neuron death is caused by unscheduled apoptosis, implicating accumulated GM2 ganglioside or a derivative in triggering of the apoptotic cascade."

    "abstract": "The GM2 activator deficiency (also known as the AB variant), Tay-Sachs disease, and Sandhoff disease are the major forms of the GM2 gangliosidoses, disorders caused by defective degradation of GM2 ganglioside. Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff diseases are caused by mutations in the genes (HEXA and HEXB) encoding the subunits of beta-hexosaminidase A. The GM2 activator deficiency is caused by mutations in the GM2A gene encoding the GM2 activator protein. For degradation of GM2 ganglioside by beta-hexosamindase A, the GM2 activator protein must participate by forming a soluble complex with the ganglioside. In each of the disorders, GM2 ganglioside and related lipids accumulate to pathologic levels in neuronal lysosomes, resulting in clinically similar disorders with an onset in the first year of life, progressive neurodegeneration, and death by early childhood. We previously have described mouse models of Tay-Sachs (Hexa -/-) and Sandhoff (Hexb -/-) diseases with vastly different clinical phenotypes. The Hexa -/- mice were asymptomatic whereas the Hexb -/- mice were severely affected. Through gene disruption in embryonic stem cells we now have established a mouse model of the GM2 activator deficiency that manifests an intermediate phenotype. The Gm2a -/- mice demonstrated neuronal storage but only in restricted regions of the brain (piriform, entorhinal cortex, amygdala, and hypothalamic nuclei) reminiscent of the asymptomatic Tay-Sachs model mice. However, unlike the Tay-Sachs mice, the Gm2a -/- mice displayed significant storage in the cerebellum and defects in balance and coordination. The abnormal ganglioside storage in the Gm2a -/- mice consisted of GM2 with a low amount of GA2. The results demonstrate that the activator protein is required for GM2 degradation and also may indicate a role for the GM2 activator in GA2 degradation."

All prenatal diagnoses for haemoglobinopathies (n = 55) were exclusively DNA-based. The three most frequent referrals were for beta-thalassaemia, sickle cell anaemia, and Tay-Sachs disease, accounting for 68 per cent of cases; the other indications were predominantly for untreatable inborn errors of metabolism. Our unit maintains population-based carrier screening programmes in high schools for beta-thalassaemia and Tay-Sachs diseases. Carriers detected in these programmes accounted for the majority of referrals for these two conditions. This study indicates that carrier testing and screening for sickle cell anaemia may be also welcomed by at-risk groups in Quebec."

In this report we describe the pathologic features of mice that carry both disrupted genes and that are deficient in all forms of beta-hexosaminidase activity. These mice displayed physical dysmorphia and extensive neuro-visceral storage. Neurons in the CNS and PNS contained pleomorphic inclusions in addition to membranous cytoplasmic bodies characteristic of gangliosidosis. Diffuse hypomyelination was also apparent in the CNS. Vacuolated cytoplasm was a conspicuous feature of chondrocytes, osteocytes and renal tubular epithelium on routine hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) -stained sections. Numerous vacuolated cells were also noted in the connective tissue, cornea, heart valves, arterial walls, liver, spleen, skin and throughout other visceral organs. These vacuolated cells stained positive with PAS, colloidal iron and alcian blue, indicating an accumulation of glycosaminoglycans. Furthermore, cultured fibroblasts showed a defect in the degradation of glycosaminoglycans, and glycosaminoglycans were excreted in the urine of these mice (1). Thus, morphological and biochemical features in these mice are consistent with those of mucopolysaccharidosis and demonstrate an essential role of beta-hexosaminidase in the degradation of glycosaminoglycans."

We identified a novel HEXA mutation (IVS7, -7 G-->A) leading to chronic TSD in a Canadian patient of English ancestry. The second allele in this patient was the exon 11 4-bp insertion mutation (/1277TATC), which is the most frequent TSD allele in Ashkenazi Jews. The IVS7, -7 G-->A mutation introduces a new 3' splice acceptor site 5 bp upstream of the normal intron 7 splice acceptor site. The mutation leads to reduction of steady-state levels of HEXA mRNA by more than 80%. Two mRNA species are produced by the IVS7, -7 G-->A allele; a normal nRNA species and an mRNA lacking exon 8. No mRNA species that was spliced at the upstream 3' splice acceptor site was detected. We used competitive PCR to quantitate mRNA species in fibroblasts obtained from this patient. We compared the amounts of three identified mRNA species to HEXA mRNA levels in cells from normal individuals and from individuals heterozygous for /1277TATC. The steady-state level of HEXA mRNA in cells from a normal individual was 17.3 pg/microg RNA. An individual heterozygous for /1277TATC produced 8.7 pg of normal HEXA mRNA/microg RNA. The HEXA mRNA species with the insertion mutation was present in patient cells at 4.8% of the level of normal HEXA nRNA in homozygous normal cells. In fibroblasts from the patient carrying the IVS7, -7 G-->A mutation, the steady-state level of exon 8-deleted HEXA mRNA was 5.9% the level of that produced by homozygous normal cells. The level of normal HEXA nRNA in this patient's cells was 10.4%."

    "abstract": "We have evaluated the feasibility of using PCR-based mutation screening for non-Jewish enzyme-defined carriers identified through Tay-Sachs disease-prevention programs. Although Tay-Sachs mutations are rare in the general population, non-Jewish individuals may be screened as spouses of Jewish carriers or as relatives of probands. In order to define a panel of alleles that might account for the majority of mutations in non-Jewish carriers, we investigated 26 independent alleles from 20 obligate carriers and 3 affected individuals. Eighteen alleles were represented by 12 previously identified mutations, 7 that were newly identified, and 1 that remains unidentified. We then investigated 46 enzyme-defined carrier alleles: 19 were pseudodeficiency alleles, and five mutations accounted for 15 other alleles. An eighth new mutation was detected among enzyme-defined carriers. Eleven alleles remain unidentified, despite the testing for 23 alleles. Some may represent false positives for the enzyme test. Our results indicate that predominant mutations, other than the two pseudodeficiency alleles (739C-->T and 745C-->T) and one disease allele (IVS9+1G-->A), do not occur in the general population. This suggests that it is not possible to define a collection of mutations that could identify an overwhelming majority of the alleles in non-Jews who may require Tay-Sachs carrier screening. We conclude that determination of carrier status by DNA analysis alone is inefficient because of the large proportion of rare alleles. Notwithstanding the possibility of false positives inherent to enzyme screening, this method remains an essential component of carrier screening in non-Jews. DNA screening can be best used as an adjunct to enzyme testing to exclude known HEXA pseudodeficiency alleles, the IVS9+1G-->A disease allele, and other mutations relevant to the subject's genetic heritage."

We have developed a multiplex allele-specific diagnostic assay (MASDA) for analysis of large numbers of samples (> 500) simultaneously for a large number of known mutations (> 100) in a single assay. MASDA utilizes oligonucleotide hybridization to interrogate DNA sequences. Multiplex DNA samples are immobilized on a solid support and a single hybridization is performed with a pool of allele-specific oligonucleotide (ASO) probes. Any probes complementary to specific mutations present in a given sample are in effect affinity purified from the pool by the target DNA. Sequence-specific band patterns (fingerprints), generated by chemical or enzymatic sequencing of the bound ASO(s), easily identify the specific mutation(s). Using this design, in a single diagnostic assay, we tested samples for 66 cystic fibrosis (CF) mutations, 14 beta-thalassemia mutations, two sickle cell anemia (SCA) mutations, three Tay-Sachs mutations, eight Gaucher mutations, four mutations in Canavan disease, four mutations in Fanconi anemia, and five mutations in BRCA1. Each mutation was correctly identified. Finally, in a blinded study of 106 of these mutations in > 500 patients, all mutations were properly identified. There were no false positives or false negatives. The MASDA assay is capable of detecting point mutations as well as small insertion or deletion mutations.

Similarities between the elements present in Gm2a and Hexa promoters might in part explain their similar expression patterns in mouse tissues. The different levels of GM2 activator protein mRNA in liver, kidney, brain, and testis are not owing to the use of different transcription start sites, because a single start site was found 50 bp upstream from the initiation codon in each these tissues. Northern blot analysis demonstrated variation in the GM2 activator protein mRNA expression during mouse development. Gm2a was mapped to Chromosome (Chr) 11, where it co-segregated with Csfgm."

    "abstract": "An 11-year-old girl died of a neuronal storage disorder that clinically was characterized by failure to thrive and muscular hypotonia from birth, with the subsequent evolution of motor neuron disease, epilepsy, and dementia. A wide range of metabolic disorders, including all forms of GM2 gangliosidosis, could be excluded. Electron microscopy demonstrated neuronal zebra body inclusions, and immunohistochemistry demonstrated that GM2 ganglioside was a major constituent of the storage material. We suggest that the patient died of a lysosomal storage disease that is clinically and biochemically different from Tay-Sachs disease, Sandhoff disease, and other GM2 gangliosidoses described previously. This case also further demonstrates that significant accumulation of GM2 ganglioside, which is crucial for dendritic formation, may occur in neuronal storage diseases lacking known defects in ganglioside catabolism."

    "abstract": "GM2 activator protein is a protein cofactor that has been shown to stimulate the enzymatic hydrolysis of both GalNAc and NeuAc from GM2 (Wu, Y. Y., Lockyer, J. M., Sugiyama, E., Pavlova, N.V., Li, Y.-T., and Li, S.-C. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 16276-16283). To understand the mechanism by which GM2 activator stimulates the hydrolysis of GM2, we examined the interaction of this activator protein with GM2 as well as with other glycosphingolipids by TLC overlay and Sephacryl S-200 gel filtration. The TLC overlay analysis unveiled the binding specificity of GM2 activator, which was not previously revealed. Under the conditions optimal for the activator protein to stimulate the hydrolysis of GM2 by beta-hexosaminidase A, GM2 activator was found to bind avidly to acidic glycosphingolipids, including gangliosides and sulfated glycosphingolipids, but not to neutral glycosphingolipids. The gangliosides devoid of sialic acids, such as asialo-GM1 and asialo-GM2, and the GM2 derivatives whose carboxyl function in the NeuAc had been modified by methyl esterification or reduction, were only very weakly bound to GM2 activator. These results indicate that the negatively charged sugar residue or sulfate group in gangliosides is one of the important sites recognized by GM2 activator. For comparison, we also studied in parallel the complex formation between glycosphingolipids and saposin B, a separate activator protein with broad specificity to stimulate the hydrolysis of various glycosphingolipids. We found that saposin B bound to neutral glycosphingolipids and gangliosides equally well, and there was an exceptionally strong binding to sulfatide. In contrast to previous reports, we found that GM2 activator formed complexes with GM2 and other gangliosides in different proportions depending on the ratio between the activator protein and the ganglioside in the incubation mixture prior to gel filtration. We were not able to detect the specific binding of GM2 activator to GM2 when GM2 was mixed with GM1 or GM3. Thus, the specificity or the mode of action of GM2 activator cannot be simply explained by its interaction with glycosphingolipids based on complex formation. The binding of GM2 activator to a wide variety of negatively charged glycosphingolipids may indicate that this activator protein has functions other than assisting the enzymatic hydrolysis of GM2."

    "abstract": "The beta-hexosaminidases (Hex) catalyze the cleavage of terminal amino sugars on a broad spectrum of glycoconjugates. The major Hex isozymes in humans, Hex A, a heterodimer of alpha and beta subunits (alphabeta), and Hex B, a homodimer of beta subunits (betabeta), have different substrate specificities. The beta subunit (HEXB gene product), hydrolyzes neutral substrates. The alpha subunit (HEXA gene product), hydrolyzes both neutral and charged substrates. Only Hex A is able to hydrolyze the most important natural substrate, the acidic glycolipid GM2 ganglioside. Mutations in the HEXA gene cause Tay-Sachs disease (TSD), a GM2 ganglioside storage disorder. We investigated the role of putative active site residues Asp-alpha258, Glu-alpha307, Glu-alpha323, and Glu-alpha462 in the alpha subunit of Hex A. A mutation at codon 258 which we described was associated with the TSD B1 phenotype, characterized by the presence of normal amounts of mature but catalytically inactive enzyme. TSD-B1 mutations are believed to involve substitutions of residues at the enzyme active site. Glu-alpha307, Glu-alpha323, and Glu-alpha462 were predicted to be active site residues by homology studies and hydrophobic cluster analysis. We used site-directed mutagenesis and expression in a novel transformed human fetal TSD neuroglial (TSD-NG) cell line (with very low levels of endogenous Hex A activity), to study the effects of mutation at candidate active site residues. Mutant HEXA cDNAs carrying conservative or isofunctional substitutions at these positions were expressed in TSD-NG cells. alphaE323D, alphaE462D, and alphaD258N cDNAs produced normally processed peptide chains with drastically reduced activity toward the alpha subunit-specific substrate 4MUGS. The alphaE307D cDNA produced a precursor peptide with significant catalytic activity. Kinetic analysis of enzymes carrying mutations at Glu-alpha323 and Asp-alpha258 (reported earlier by Bayleran, J., Hechtman, P., Kolodny, E., and Kaback, M. (1987) Am. J. Hum. Genet. 41,532-548) indicated no significant change in substrate binding properties. Our data, viewed in the context of homology studies and modeling, and studies with suicide substrates, suggest that Glu-alpha323 and Asp-alpha258 are active site residues and that Glu-alpha323 is involved in catalysis."

Phosphoimaging quantitation of the parents' RNAs showed that the steady-state levels of mRNAs of the mutant exons 5 and 8 were 5% and 50%, respectively, of normal levels. The exon 5 mutated allele with the premature translation termination resulted in severe deficiency of Hex A.

Mutations in the HEXB gene encoding the beta-subunits of Hex that result in heat-labile Hex B thus may lead to erroneous enzymatic genotyping regarding TSD. Utilizing single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis for all 14 exons of HEXB followed by direct sequencing of aberrant fragments, we screened individuals whose Hex B was heat labile. A novel heat labile mutation, previously concluded to exist in the HEXB gene, was identified among Jews and Arabs as 1627 G-->A. One individual with heat labile Hex B (HLB) was negative for this novel mutation and for the known 1514 G-->A HLB mutation, proving that there exists at least one other unidentified HLB mutation. Based on these results, it is advisable to perform DNA tests for 1627 G-->A mutation in suspected HLB individuals."

A large proportion of the New England population has French Canadian heritage; thus, it is important to determine if they too are at increased risk for TSD heterozygosity. This prospective study was designed to assess the TSD heterozygote frequency among people with French Canadian background living in Massachusetts. A simultaneous screen for heterozygosity for Sandhoff disease, a related genetic disorder, was also undertaken. 1260 non-pregnant subjects of French Canadian background were included in the study. beta hexosaminidase activity was measured in blood samples, and results were evaluated for TSD and Sandhoff disease heterozygosity. Samples from the TSD heterozygotes were also subjected to mutation analysis. Of the 1260 samples studied, 22 (1 in 57; CI 1 in 41, 1 in 98) were identified as TSD heterozygotes by enzymatic analyses and 11 subjects (1 in 114; CI 1 in 72, 1 in 280) were identified as Sandhoff disease heterozygotes. Three of the 22 TSD heterozygotes were found to have benign pseudodeficiency mutations, resulting in a maximum TSD heterozygote frequency of 19 in 1260 (1 in 66; CI 1 in 46, 1 in 120). Together, these data provide a maximum frequency of heterozygosity for TSD or Sandhoff disease of 30 in 1260 (1 in 42; CI 1 in 31, 1 in 64) in this population. Simultaneous screening for TSD and Sandhoff disease heterozygosity by assay of beta hexosaminidases A and B activities provides a possible method for use with subjects of French Canadian background. The relevance of some of the novel mutations identified in this group needs further study. However, the comparatively high combined frequency of TSD and Sandhoff disease heterozygosity indicates a need for discussion regarding the appropriateness of carrier testing for these disorders for persons of French Canadian background in Massachusetts."

Previous studies among Moroccan Jewish TSD families identified three HEXA mutations. In this study, extended to enzyme-defined and new obilgate TSD carriers, we found four additional mutations. One of them is a novel, IVS5-2(A-->G) substitution, resulting in exon skipping, and it was found only among enzyme-defined carriers. The seven HEXA identified mutations among Moroccan Jews are: deltaF(304/305), R170Q, IVS-2(A-->G), Y180X, E482K, 1278+TATC, and IVS12+1(G-->C). Their respective distribution among 51 unrelated enzyme-defined and obligate carriers is 22:19:6:1:1:1:1. The mutation(s) remain unknown in only three enzyme-defined carriers. Five of the seven Moroccan mutations, including the three most common ones, were not found among Ashkenazi Jews. Compared with the much larger and relatively homogeneous Ashkenazi population, the finding among Moroccan Jews probably reflects their much longer history."

    "abstract": "Tay-Sachs disease is an autosomal recessive disorder affecting the central nervous system. The disorder results from mutations in the gene encoding the alpha-subunit of beta-hexosaminidase A, a lysosomal enzyme composed of alpha and beta polypeptides. Seventy-eight mutations in the Hex A gene have been described and include 65 single base substitutions, one large and 10 small deletions, and two small insertions. Because these mutations cripple the catalytic activity of beta-hexosaminidase to varying degrees, Tay-Sachs disease displays clinical heterogeneity. Forty-five of the single base substitutions cause missense mutations; 39 of these are disease causing, three are benign but cause a change in phenotype, and three are neutral polymorphisms. Six nonsense mutations and 14 splice site lesions result from single base substitutions, and all but one of the splice site lesions cause a severe form of Tay-Sachs disease. Eight frameshift mutations arise from six deletion- and two insertion-type lesions. One of these insertions, consisting of four bases within exon 11, is found in 80% of the carriers of Tay-Sachs disease from the Ashkenazi Jewish population, an ethnic group that has a 10-fold higher gene frequency for a severe form of the disorder than the general population. A very large deletion, 7.5 kilobases, including all of exon 1 and portions of DNA upstream and downstream from that exon, is the major mutation found in Tay-Sachs disease carriers from the French Canadian population, a geographic isolate displaying an elevated carrier frequency. Most of the other mutations are confined to single pedigrees. Identification of these mutations has permitted more accurate carrier information, prenatal diagnosis, and disease prognosis. In conjunction with a precise tertiary structure of the enzyme, these mutations could be used to gain insight into the structure-function relationships of the lysosomal enzyme."

Juvenile and adult Hex A deficiencies are less severe but rare variants with some residual Hex A activity. All these variants are most prevalent among Ashkenazi Jews. We describe a non-Jewish family in which four adult brothers and sisters had markedly reduced Hex A activities and onset of symptoms in the second decade of life. The phenotypical expression was remarkably homogeneous, consisting in a combination of slowly progressive motor neuron disease, ataxia and ocular motor disturbances. None of the patients were demented at this stage of their illness. Magnetic resonance studies showed severe cerebellar atrophy, but were otherwise normal. Hex A deficiency was established by biochemical measurements in the serum and skin fibroblasts using the fluorogenic substrates 4-MUG and 4-MUGS as well as by gel electrophoresis. Molecular genetic studies revealed that the patients are compound heterozygotes for the 'adult' mutation Gly269 --> Ser and the 'infantile' 4-base insertion in exon 11 of the Hex A gene."

Several pregnancies were obtained by identifying sex of embryos using dual fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) with fluorochrome labelled DNA sequences specific for X- and Y-chromosomes to interphase nuclei. Development of single cell PCR for single gene defects led to diagnose several genetic disorders.

Mass screening for TSD heterozygotes has been routine in the Ashkenazi Jewish population since the early 1970s. Recent advances in the molecular genetics and epidemiology of TSD require a reevaluation of heterozygote screening practices. The use of DNA-based analyses for a panel of common mutations detects about 98% of TSD mutations found in the Ashkenazi Jews and about 50% of TSD mutations found in the general non-Jewish population; enzyme-based analysis has nearly 100% sensitivity for all populations. We recommend 1) that members of several ethnic groups and persons with a family history consistent with TSD be offered testing for TSD heterozygosity and 2) that assays of enzyme activity be used as the primary screening tool, with mutation analysis used as an adjunct tool in certain cases."

    "abstract": "Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) is a neurodegenerative genetic disorder caused by a deficiency of beta-hexosaminidase A (Hex A) activity. To diagnose TSD and to screen for TSD heterozygosity, laboratories use an assay that exploits the differential thermolability of the major beta-hexosaminidase isoenzymes, Hex A and Hex B. At 50-52 degrees C Hex A is labile, and Hex B is stable. We previously noted that the stability of leukocyte Hex B at 52 degrees C varied significantly, depending on the sample concentration in the incubation mixture. We have now examined this phenomenon in enzyme from cultured cells used for prenatal and postnatal diagnostic testing. We found that fibroblast Hex A and Hex B behave similarly to the leukocyte isoenzymes. In control and TSD fibroblasts there was a linear correlation between Hex B thermostability and sample concentration; at lower sample concentrations Hex B was less stable than at higher concentrations. Dialysis of the samples prior to heat treatment did not change the thermostability properties of Hex B, indicating that the change in stability is not due to a soluble low molecular weight substance. Cultured amniotic fluid cell and chorionic villus cell Hex B had a similar, but less pronounced, instability at low sample concentrations. Therefore, the unusual thermolability properties of Hex B, first detected for leukocyte Hex B, were noted in multiple tissues. Based on these data, we suggest that the concentration of cell extract be stringently controlled when the heat-inactivation method is used for the pre- or postnatal diagnosis of TSD, and that supplementation with non-thermolability-based beta-hexosaminidase assays should be employed as needed."

Each gene encodes a subunit for the heterodimeric lysosomal enzyme, beta-hexosaminidase A (alpha beta), as well as for the homodimers beta-hexosaminidase B (beta beta) and S (alpha alpha). In this study, we have produced mice that have both Hexa and Hexb genes disrupted through interbreeding Tay-Sachs (Hexa-/-) and Sandhoff (Hexb-/-) disease model mice. Lacking both the alpha and beta-subunits these 'double knockout' mice displayed a total deficiency of all forms of lysosomal beta-hexosaminidase including the small amount of beta-hexosaminidase S present in the Sandhoff disease model mice. More surprisingly, these mice showed the phenotypic, pathologic and biochemical features of the mucopolysaccharidoses, lysosomal storage diseases caused by the accumulation of glycosaminoglycans. The mucopolysaccharidosis phenotype is not seen in the Tay-Sachs or Sandhoff disease model mice or in the corresponding human patients. This result demonstrates that glycosaminoglycans are crucial substrates for beta-hexosaminidase and that their lack of storage in Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff diseases is due to functional redundancy in the beta-hexosaminidase enzyme system."

This study was prompted by a recent report that the frequency of heterozygosity for TSD among Irish Americans was 1 in 8, a frequency much higher than that recognised for any other population group. We identified 19 of 576 (3.3%) people of Irish background as TSD heterozygotes by the standard thermolability assay for beta-hexosaminidase A (Hex A) activity. Three of 289 people of non-Irish British Isles background (1%) were also identified as heterozygotes by biochemical testing. Specimens from the biochemically identified Irish heterozygotes were analysed for seven different Hex A alpha subunit gene mutations; three (15.8%) had a lethal +1 IVS-9 G to A mutation, previously noted to be a common mutation among TSD heterozygotes of Irish ancestry. Eight of 19 (42.1%) had one of two benign or pseudodeficiency mutations, and no mutation was found in 42.1% of the heterozygotes analysed. These data indicate that non-Jewish Americans with Irish background have a significantly increased frequency of heterozygosity at the Hex A alpha subunit gene locus, but that approximately 42% of the biochemically ascertained heterozygotes have clinically benign mutations. A pseudodeficiency mutation was identified in one of the three TSD heterozygotes of non-Irish British Isles background; no mutations were found in the other two. The data allow for a frequency estimate of deleterious alleles for TSD among Irish Americans of 1 in 192 to 1 in 52. Non-Jewish Americans with ancestry from Great Britain have a minimal, if any, increase in rate of heterozygosity at the TSD gene locus relative to the general population."

Between 1972 and 1992, we screened 14,844 Ashkenazi-Jewish students, identified 521 HexA-deficient carriers (frequency 1:28), reached 89% of the demographic cohort in the educational component of the program, and achieved 67% voluntary participation in the subsequent screening phase. The corresponding data for the beta-thalassemia program are 25,274 students (mainly of Mediterranean origin) representing 67% of the cohort with 61% voluntary participation in the screening phase (693 carriers; frequency 1:36). From demographic data, we deduce that virtually all the carriers identified in the high-school screening program remembered their status, had their partner tested if they did not already know they were a carrier couple, and took up the options for reproductive counseling/prenatal diagnosis. In Montreal, the current origin of all couples using prenatal diagnosis for Tay-Sachs and beta-thalassemia diseases is the corresponding genetic screening/testing program, whereas, at the beginning of the programs, it was always because there was a history of an affected person in the family. Incidence of the two diseases has fallen by 90%-95% over 20 years; the rare new cases are born (with two exceptions) outside the target communities or to nonscreened couples."

T1-weighted images exhibited hyperintensity in the basal ganglia, thalamus, and along the cortical layer of the cerebrum, which appeared to by hypointense on T2-weighted images. MR was apparently superior to CT in clearly delineating lesions of this disease. These abnormal signal intensities in the late phase may reflect the pathological findings, marked accumulation of GM2 ganglioside in the basal ganglia and thalamus and along the cerebral gray matter."

    "title": "Bacterial chitobiase structure provides insight into catalytic mechanism and the basis of Tay-Sachs disease.",
    "abstract": "Chitin, the second most abundant polysaccharide on earth, is degraded by chitinases and chitobiases. The structure of Serratia marcescens chitobiase has been refined at 1.9 A resolution. The mature protein is folded into four domains and its active site is situated at the C-terminal end of the central (beta alpha)8-barrel. Based on the structure of the complex with the substrate disaccharide chitobiose, we propose an acid-base reaction mechanism, in which only one protein carboxylate acts as catalytic acid, while the nucleophile is the polar acetamido group of the sugar in a substrate-assisted reaction. The structural data lead to the hypothesis that the reaction proceeds with retention of anomeric configuration. The structure allows us to model the catalytic domain of the homologous hexosaminidases to give a structural rationale to pathogenic mutations that underlie Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff disease."

    "abstract": "Substitution mutations adversely affecting the alpha-subunit of beta-hexosaminidase A (alphabeta) (EC 3.2.1.52) result in Tay-Sachs disease. The majority affect the initial folding of the pro-alpha chain in the endoplasmic reticulum, resulting in its retention and degradation. A much less common occurrence is a mutation that specifically affects an \"active-site\" residue necessary for substrate binding and/or catalysis. In this case, hexosaminidase A is present in the lysosome, but it lacks all alpha-specific activity. This biochemical phenotype is referred to as the \"B1-variant form\" of Tay-Sachs disease. Kinetic analysis of suspected B1-variant mutations is complex because hexosaminidase A is heterodimeric and both subunits possess similar active sites. In this report, we examine a previously identified B1-variant mutation, alpha-Val192Leu. Chinese hamster ovary cells were permanently cotransfected with an alpha-cDNA-construct encoding the substitution and a mutant beta-cDNA (beta-Arg211Lys), encoding a beta-subunit that is inactive but normal in all other respects. We were surprised to find that the Val192Leu substitution, produced a pro-alpha chain that did not form alpha-beta dimers and was not transported to the lysosome. Finally, we reexamined the hexosaminidase activity and protein levels in the fibroblasts from the original patient. These data were also not consistent with the biochemical phenotype of the B1 variant of Tay-Sachs disease previously reported to be present. Thus, we conclude that the Val192Leu substitution does not specifically affect the alpha-active site."

    "title": "Identification of an active acidic residue in the catalytic site of beta-hexosaminidase.",
    "abstract": "Human beta-hexosaminidases A and B (EC 3.2.1.52) are dimeric lysosomal glycosidases composed of evolutionarily related alpha and/or beta subunits. Both isozymes hydrolyze terminal beta-linked GalNAc or GlcNAc residues from numerous artificial and natural substrates; however, in vivo GM2 ganglioside is a substrate for only the heterodimeric A isozyme. Thus, mutations in either gene encoding its alpha or beta subunits can result in GM2 ganglioside storage and Tay-Sachs or Sandhoff disease, respectively. All glycosyl hydrolases ae believed to have one or more acidic residues in their catalytic site. We demonstrate that incubation of hexosaminidase with a chemical modifier specific for carboxyl side chains produces a time-dependent loss of activity, and that this effect can be blocked by the inclusion of a strong competitive inhibitor in the reaction mix. We hypothesized that the catalytic acid residue(s) should be located in a region of overall homology and be invariant within the aligned deduced primary sequences of the human alpha and beta subunits, as well as hexosaminidases from other species, including bacteria. Such a region is encoded by exons 5-6 of the HEXA and HEXB genes. This region includes beta Arg211 (invariant in 15 sequences), which we have previously shown to be an active residue. This region also contains two invariant and one conserved acidic residues. A fourth acidic residue, Asp alpha 258, beta 290, in exon 7 was also investigated because of its association with the B1 variant of Tay-Sachs disease. Conservative substitutions were made at each candidate residue by in vitro mutagenesis of a beta cDNA, followed by cellular expression. Of these, only the beta Asp196Asn substitution decreased the kcat (350-910-fold) without any noticeable effect on the K(m). Mutagenesis of either beta Asp240 or beta Asp290 to Asn decreased kcat by 10- or 1.4-fold but also raised the K(m) of the enzyme 11- of 3-fold, respectively. The above results strongly suggest that beta Asp196 is a catalytic acid residue in beta-hexosaminidase."

The genetic screening of prospective donors by commercial semen banks was evaluated using written questionnaires completed by bank directors. Responses were analyzed to determine exclusion criteria, adherence to published guidelines, and contribution of genetic professionals. Semen banks were selected on the basis of membership in the American Association of Tissue Banks and commercial use of semen for artificial insemination by donor. Semen bank practices as reported by commercial semen bank directors. Of 37 eligible banks, 16 responded. All screen prospective donors by medical/family history and physical examination, 94% have upper age limits; 63% examine for minor physical defects; 56% routinely karyotype; 81% screen men of ethnic groups at risk for Tay Sachs disease, sickle cell disease and thalassemia; 19% screen all donors; 25% screen all donors for cystic fibrosis and 50% only screen if family history positive. Donor rejection was based on three criteria: mode of inheritance of familial disorder, severity of disease, and availability of carrier/confirmatory testing of donor genotype. Ten of 16 banks have no genetic professional on staff. Commercial semen banks primarily rely on family history as the major exclusion criterion in genetic screening of donors. Considerable differences exist among semen bank practices in accordance with guidelines published by national agencies. Genetic professionals have a minimal effect overall on evaluation of semen donors."

The International Working Group on Preimplantation Genetics meets annually to discuss progress and pitfalls in this field. Although preimplantation genetic diagnosis offers hope to patients at risk of transmitting disease, there are many technical hazards of this experimental procedure. Technical difficulties must be overcome in order for preimplantation genetic diagnosis to become a standard clinical tool. This review will highlight some of the recent advances and problems in the field of preimplantation genetic diagnosis."

To explore the feasibility of using ex vivo gene transfer in this lysosomal storage disease, we produced ecotropic retroviruses encoding the human beta-hexosaminidase alpha-subunit cDNA and transduced multipotent neural cell lines. Transduced progenitors stably expressed and secreted high levels of biologically active beta-hexosaminidase A in vitro and cross-corrected the metabolic defect in a human Tay-Sachs fibroblasts cell line in vitro. These genetically engineered CNS progenitors were transplanted into the brains of both normal fetal and newborn mice. Engrafted brains, analyzed at various ages after transplant, produced substantial amounts of human beta-hexosaminidase alpha-subunit transcript and protein, which was enzymatically active throughout the brain at a level reported to be therapeutic in Tay-Sachs disease.

The cells used were skin fibroblasts and white blood cells, i.e. lymphocytes, monocytes and macrophages. In the severe infantile form of the GM2 gangliosidosis, Tay-Sachs disease, the sulforhodamine-GM1 was hydrolyzed within the lysosomes to the corresponding sulforhodamine-GM2 which, because of lack of Hex A activity, was not further degraded. In comparison, in the cells derived from GM2 gangliosidoses carriers, as well as pseudodeficient and adult forms of GM2 gangliosidosis, the sulforhodamine-GM2 was further processed and sequentially degraded by the lysosomal glycosidases to sulforhodamine-ceramide. The latter was converted to sulforhodamine-sphingomyelin, which was secreted into the culture medium. The fluorescence of the sulforhodamine ceramide in cell extracts and/or sulforhodamine-sphingomyelin in the culture medium was quantified and related to parallel data obtained using cells of normal individuals. This permitted distinguishing between the various GM2 gangliosidoses subtypes and relating the intracellular hydrolysis of sulforhodamine-GM1 to the genotypes of the respective GM2 gangliosidoses variants."

PCR has also been used for the specific diagnosis of a number of single gene defects, mainly for cystic fibrosis but also for the diagnosis of Lesch Nyhan syndrome, Fragile X, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Tay Sachs, haemophilia and RhD blood typing. For PCR sexing, a total of 62 cycles have been performed with 14 pregnancies, 8 deliveries and 11 babies born. For FISH sexing, 70 cycles have resulted in 15 pregnancies, 8 deliveries and 11 babies born. For the specific diagnosis of single genes defects, a total of 65 cycles resulted in 21 pregnancies, 12 deliveries and 12 babies born. Overall, 197 cycles were performed, with 171 embryo transfers (86%), 50 pregnancies (25% per cycle, 29% per transfer), 28 deliveries and 34 babies born.

    "abstract": "Human lysosomal beta-hexosaminidases are encoded by two genes, HEXA and HEXB, specifying an alpha- and a beta-subunit, respectively. The subunits dimerize to form beta-hexosaminidase A (alpha beta), beta-hexosaminidase B (beta beta), and beta-hexosaminidase S (alpha alpha). This enzyme system has the capacity to degrade a variety of cellular substrates: oligosaccharides, glycosaminoglycans, and glycolipids containing beta-linked N-acetylglucosaminyl or N-galactosaminyl residues. Mutations in either the HEXA gene or HEXB gene lead to an accumulation of GM2 ganglioside in neurons, resulting in the severe neurodegenerative disorders termed the GM2 gangliosidoses. To identify the DNA elements responsible for hexosaminidase expression, we ligated the 5'-flanking sequences of both the human and mouse hexosaminidase genes to a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene. The resulting plasmids were transfected into NIH-3T3 cells and CAT activity was determined as a measure of promoter strength. By 5' deletion analysis, it was found that essential sequences for HEXA expression resided within a 40-bp region between 100 bp and 60 bp upstream of the ATG initiation codon. This area contained two potential estrogen response element half-sites as well as potential binding sites for transcription factors NF-E1 and AP-2. Similarly, important HEXB promoter sequences were localized to a 60-bp region between 150 bp and 90 bp upstream of the ATG codon. By performing scanning mutagenesis on a 60-bp region within the 150-bp HEXB construct, we defined an essential promoter element of 12 bp that contained two potential AP-1 sites. The mouse Hexa and Hexb 5'-flanking sequences were found to contain regions similar in sequence, location, and activity to the essential promoter elements defined in the cognate human genes. No sequence similarity was found, however, between 5'-flanking regions of the HEXA and HEXB genes. These essential promoter elements represent potential sites for HEXA and HEXB mutations that could alter enzyme expression in Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff diseases, respectively."

The disclosure of disease genetically conditioned depends, in many cases, on the effect of a broad spectrum of different environmental factors. Screening tests for carries of defective genes play a key role in the detection of risk for genetically conditioned diseases. Screening tests carried out for many years yielded a very diversified results. Some of them, for example, the screening test for the gene responsible for Tay-Sachs disease, produced good results, whereas results of other tests, like the test for the gene responsible for crescent anaemia, proved to be unsatisfactory. Among genetically conditioned diseases, neoplastic diseases are the subject of particular interest. It is already known that these diseases may be attributed to the accumulation of genetic errors in a normal cell, and that this phenomena applies to certain categories of genes. An analysis of genetic material of persons from the families with higher cancer incidence revealed the relationship between cancer and inheritance of some defective genes. Nevertheless, it should be stressed that the development of cancer is not definitely foregone even if genetic features of cancer disease are detected in a given person. The presence of such features only indicates an inborn or acquired defect (as a result of mutation) that predisposes him/her to illness. A great progress in molecular oncology made during the last years and the development of genetic maps relevant to neoplastic diseases should contribute to the detection of such genetic markers which could facilitate the identification of persons with a higher risk for neoplastic diseases and allow to take relevant preventive measures in due time."

Among 1,364 young adults of Ashkenazic ancestry in the Dor Yeshurim community who were tested, 52 were Tay-Sachs carriers, 110 were Gaucher carriers, and 62 were cystic fibrosis carriers. Ten individuals were carriers for two diseases, and three unsuspected cases were diagnosed with Gaucher disease based on mutation test results. In addition to Tay-Sachs mutation data, results for hexosaminidase A activity were also available. All of 1,254 samples normal by enzyme quantitation were also negative for the three alpha-subunit mutations tested, and all of 43 samples with 'inconclusive' enzyme results were negative by DNA. Only 52 of 67 samples positive by enzyme assay were also positive for one of the three mutations tested for Tay-Sachs disease. The data suggest a high degree of false positivity inherent in enzyme identification of carriers. There are no correlative methods to assess the sensitivity of Gaucher and CF carrier testing. The results show that population screening can be carried out efficiently by DNA analysis, with the accrual of carrier information for three separate diseases conducted as a single test. Furthermore, the DNA method for Tay-Sachs screening appears to exceed the specificity of hexosaminidase A enzyme testing."

The disease results from mutations in the HEXA gene, which codes for the alpha chain of beta-hexosaminidase. The castastrophic neurodegenerative progression of the disease is thought to be a consequence of massive neuronal accumulation of GM2 ganglioside and related glycolipids in the brain and nervous system of the patients. Fuller understanding of the pathogenesis and the development of therapeutic procedures have both suffered from the lack of an animal model. We have used gene targeting in embryonic stem (ES) cells to disrupt the mouse Hexa gene. Mice homozygous for the disrupted allele mimic several biochemical and histological features of human Tay-Sachs disease. Hexa-/- mice displayed a total deficiency of beta-hexosaminidase A activity, and membranous cytoplasmic inclusions typical of GM2 gangliosidoses were found in the cytoplasm of their neurons. However, while the number of storage neurons increased with age, it remained low compared with that found in human, and no apparent motor or behavioral disorders could be observed. This suggests that the presence of beta-hexosaminidase A is not an absolute requirement of ganglioside degradation in mice. These mice should help us to understand several aspects of the disease as well as the physiological functions of hexosaminidase in mice. They should also provide a valuable animal model in which to test new forms of therapy, and in particular gene delivery into the central nervous system."

Lipid NANA was within normal limits in gray and white matter and GM2 gangliosides were moderately elevated at 11.5% lipid NANA. Beta-hexosaminidase A activity was reduced, secondary to a compound mutation at the alpha-locus. Lysosomal hydrolase activities and lipid composition showed nonspecific abnormalities. Exhaustive tissue extraction ruled out the possibility of tightly bound gangliosides to account for the relatively low GM2 ganglioside concentration. The extract contained unidentified chromogenic substances interfering with the resorcinol reaction. The similarly affected patient's sister lived to age 26 years and her brain was even more atrophic.

    "abstract": "GM2 ganglioside, although scarce in normal adult brain, is the predominant ganglioside accumulating in several types of lysosomal disorders, most notably Tay-Sachs disease. Pyramidal neurons of cerebral cortex in Tay-Sachs, as well as many other types of neuronal storage disorders, are known to exhibit a phenomenon believed unique to storage disorders: growth of ectopic dendrites. Recent studies have shown that a common metabolic abnormality shared by storage diseases with ectopic dendrite growth is the abnormal accumulation of GM2 ganglioside. The correlation between increased levels of GM2 and the presence of ectopic dendrites has been found in both ganglioside and nonganglioside storage disorders, the latter including sphingomyelin-cholesterol lipidosis, mucopolysaccharidosis, and alpha-mannosidosis. Quantitative HPTLC analysis has shown that increases in GM2 occur in proportion to the incidence of ectopic dendrite growth, whereas other gangliosides, including GM1, lack similar increases. Immunocytochemical studies of all nonganglioside storage diseases which exhibit ectopic dendritogenesis have revealed heightened GM2 ganglioside-immunoreactivity in the cortical pyramidal cell population, whereas nerurons in normal adult brain exhibit little or no staining for this ganglioside. Further, studies examining disease development have consistently shown that accumulation of GM2 ganglioside precedes growth of ectopic dendrites, indicating that it is not simply occurring secondary to new membrane production. These findings have prompted an examination for a similar relationship between GM2 ganglioside and dendritogenesis in cortical neurons of normal developing brain. Results show that GM2 ganglioside-immunoreactivity is consistently elevated in immature neurons during the period when they are undergoing active dendritic initiation, but this staining diminishes dramatically as the dendritic trees of these cells mature. Collectively, these studies on diseased and normal brain offer compelling evidence that GM2 ganglioside plays a pivotal role in the regulation of dendritogenesis in cortical pyramidal neurons."

Unlike the two human disorders, the two mouse models show very different neurologic phenotypes. Although exhibiting biochemical and pathologic features of the disease, the Tay-Sachs model showed no neurological abnormalities. In contrast, the Sandhoff model was severely affected. The phenotypic difference between the two mouse models is the result of differences in the ganglioside degradation pathway between mice and humans."

Pilot survey of carrier rates and community attitudes. Sydney, February 1993 to November 1994. 147 self- or medically referred people of Ashkenazi Jewish origin were tested. Jewish religious, medical and community organisations and leaders were consulted. Prevalence of HEXA mutations, client and community preference for different testing and reporting strategies. Frequency of heterozygous carriers was 1 in 18, with a relative frequency of the three major allelic variants similar to that in overseas studies. Most subjects were medically referred and preferred individual reporting of their carrier status. Community representatives had serious reservations about this strategy and few orthodox Jews participated in the study. An alternative strategy was developed for future testing. Frequency of heterozygous carriers of the Tay-Sachs disease gene was higher than found among Ashkenazi Jews in other countries, possibly because of ascertainment bias. A testing strategy with medical referral and individual reporting of carrier status may not be appropriate for all the community at risk and a modified strategy is necessary."

We demonstrate that both methods could be used for the HEX isoenzymes by comparing wild-type and mutant human fibroblast cell lines, deficient for either an alpha or beta subunit from Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff patients.

A 17-year-old non-Jewish male patient was referred with a history of treatment-resistant catatonic schizophrenia. We uncovered coexistent neurologic abnormalities and evidence of cognitive decline. Metabolic screening revealed a severe deficiency of beta-hexosaminidase A. We reviewed the literature on late-onset gangliosidosis with attention to (1) the nature of the associated psychiatric and neurologic abnormalities and (2) the treatment of psychosis in these patients. The patient's catatonia responded promptly to benzodiazepine therapy. Treatment with neuroleptic medication resulted in the rapid development of neuroleptic malignant syndrome. The patient was thereafter maintained on lorazepam with resolution of his acute psychiatric disturbances and unexpected improvement in his neurologic status. Patients with hexosaminidase deficiency may first present in adolescence or adulthood with psychiatric illness, particularly schizophrenic-like psychosis. The presence of speech disturbance, gait abnormalities, movement disorders, and cognitive decline may indicate an underlying metabolic disorder. The use of traditional neuroleptics to treat the psychosis in such individuals may produce an unacceptably high risk/benefit ratio. Benzodiazepines may ameliorate the psychiatric and neurologic abnormalities in these patients."

In order to accomplish this, death records and laboratory diagnostic records were surveyed to ascertain Tay-Sachs deaths in a cohort of 372,000 live births between 1977-1986. The proportion of the total population with French-Canadian or Jewish heritage was determined from census and birth records, and the ethnic background of Tay-Sachs cases was determined from the corresponding birth records. In 1,860 births, both parents were of Ashkenazi Jewish heritage. One of those children was diagnosed with Tay-Sachs disease. In 41,000 births, both parents were of French-Canadian heritage, and in an additional 93,000 births, one parent was of French-Canadian heritage. No cases of Tay-Sachs disease were identified in the offspring of those individuals. Approximately 14 cases (95% confidence interval 8-20) would be expected, if the gene frequency approximated that reported for individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish heritage. Based on the results of this study, routine testing for Tay-Sachs disease heterozygosity is not indicated for persons of French-Canadian heritage in northern New England. This conclusion may not necessarily be valid for persons of French-Canadian heritage residing in other states. Further studies of Tay-Sachs disease mutations and prevalence among persons of French-Canadian heritage will be important to determine possible regional variations in gene frequencies."

The biochemical characteristics of the variant HexA suggest that both active sites are affected by the mutation(s). Kinetic studies with the beta-subunit specific substrate, 4-methylumbelliferyl-beta-D-N-acetylglucosamine (MUG), revealed a significant difference between the Km values. of normal and variant HexA, while no difference was found when the sulfated substrate MUG-6-sulfate (MUGS), which is specific for the alpha-subunit active site, was used. The Vmax values for both substrates were significantly lower in extracts from B1 variant cells than in control extracts, implying a reduced enzyme level in the variant cells. A noncompetitive inhibitor of the reaction with MUGS, N-acetylglucosamine (NAG), induced a significant inhibition (30%) in the mutant cells only. When MUG was used as substrate, variant HexA was found to be more heat stable (T50 = 170 min) than normal HexA (T50 = 65 min). Furthermore, the mutant cell preparation differed from control in the relation between Hex thermosensitivity and protein concentration in the reaction. Two new mutations were identified in exon 5 of the HexA gene: a C496 to G transversion, which produced an Arg166 -->Gly alteration and a deletion of C498 which generated a shift in the reading frame. The patient was a heterozygote for both mutations even though her parents are first cousins. There is no evidence as yet which of these mutations accounts for the B1 phenotype."

A couple, both carriers for the 4 base pair (bp) insertion in exon 11 of the beta-hexosaminidase A gene, which results in TSD, underwent IVF, pre-embryo biopsy, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) DNA amplification of the biopsied blastomeres, and pre-embryo transfer. One to two blastomeres were aspirated using a biopsy pipette that was inserted through an opening in the zona formed with acidified phosphate buffer. Polymerase chain reaction was performed on the individual blastomeres for 20 cycles followed by an additional 30 cycles using nested primers. This yielded amplified DNA products of 272 and 276 bp for the normal and mutant gene, respectively. Heteroduplex formation was used for identification of normal, homozygous affected, and heterozygous pre-embryos. Seven of 13 oocytes fertilized normally and were biopsied at the four- to eight-cell stages. Deoxyribonucleic acid amplification occurred in four of seven pre-embryos (one homozygous affected and three homozygous normal pre-embryos). The three normal pre-embryos that continued to cleave after biopsy were transferred on the evening of day 3 after retrieval. Subsequently, a single gestational sac was observed and the genetic diagnosis was confirmed at amniocentesis.

Known human lymphoblast cell lines and human embryo blastomeres were evaluated in a single-cell, nested primer polymerase chain reaction system with primer sequences for the specific locus surrounding the four base pair insertion mutation on exon 11 of beta-hexosaminidase A-Tay-Sachs disease, the delta F508 mutation of cystic fibrosis, and the sex-determining region on the Y chromosome. Reamplification polymerase chain reaction with standard polymerase chain reaction and primer extension preamplification was performed in deoxyribonucleic acid preparations after previous polymerase chain reaction amplification attempts had resulted in failure of amplification. The amplification efficiency of Tay-Sachs disease, 51% (97/187), was significantly lower than that for cystic fibrosis, 85% (87/107), and for the sex-determining region on the Y chromosome, 85% (77/90). Tay-Sachs disease polymerase chain reaction amplification occurred in 51% of one-cell lymphoblasts, 89% of two-cell lymphoblasts, and 94% of samples when more than two cells were processed together. When previous amplification failure had occurred, standard Tay-Sachs disease polymerase chain reaction resulted in an amplification efficiency of 16% (three of 19), whereas primer extension preamplification polymerase chain reaction for Tay-Sachs disease resulted in amplification of 52% (31/59) lymphoblasts and 54% (13/24) of polyspermic human blastomeres. Four of six human blastomeres in which amplification failure occurred in a Tay-Sachs disease preimplantation genetic diagnosis cycle amplified by primer extension preamplification polymerase chain reaction, which increased the diagnostic information obtained from four to six of the seven embryos on which biopsy was performed. We suggest that practical approaches for consideration within a clinical preimplantation genetic diagnosis program to limit the net effect of amplification failure (i.e., reduced embryo transfer number) include increasing the deoxyribonucleic acid content in the polymerase chain reaction tube by using more than one blastomere and by using primer extension preamplification when the initial attempt at amplification fails."

Benign mutations account for only approximately 2% of Jewish and approximately 36% of non-Jewish enzyme-defined carriers. A carrier frequency of 1/53 (n = 1,434) was found in an ongoing prospective analysis of persons of French Canadian background living in New England by using an enzyme-based assay. DNA from enzyme-defined carriers from this population was analyzed to determine the molecular basis of Hex A deficiency. Samples (36) were tested for common mutations, and samples that were negative for these were screened for uncommon or novel mutations by using SSCP analysis. Exons showing mobility shifts were sequenced, and most mutations were confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion. Known disease-causing mutations were found in nine samples (four had a 7.6-kb deletion found in 80% of French Canadian TSD alleles), and known benign mutations were found in four samples. Seven novel changes were identified, including G748A in four samples. The molecular basis of Hex A deficiency in this carrier population differs from that of French Canadian TSD patients.

Precise molecular diagnoses are thus possible using applied molecular markers. Prevention of disease can be achieved using these molecular markers with genetic counseling and appropriate family planning. Significant progress is being made in this regard with Tay-Sachs disease, Huntington's disease, the dominantly inherited ataxias, and the muscular dystrophies. Further, this molecular genotyping will be of indispensible value to families with these diseases when somatic cell gene therapy becomes available.

Each major step leading to our present understanding of the disease are highlighted. The original interest in the cause of this devastating disease in the late 1800s led to the identification of a novel glycolipid. GM2 ganglioside, stored in the neurons of Tay-Sachs patients in the 1930s, and the elucidation of its structure in the 1960s. The identification of the defective isozyme, beta-hexosaminidase A, followed in 1968-69. Elucidation of the subunit structures of the hexosaminidase A (alpha beta) and B (beta beta) isozymes in 1973 and their purification in 1974-80, led to the characterization of the biosynthesis, assembly, intracellular transport, and posttranslational processing of the two subunits in the 1980s. The ability to purify milligram quantities of the isozymes made possible the isolation of cDNA clones encoding both subunits in 1985, and ultimately the identification of the causes of Jewish Tay-Sachs disease at the genomic DNA level in 1988. Tay-Sachs disease is the major model for lysosomal storage diseases. Similarly, the work done in the 1980s on hexosaminidase has been used as a model for understanding the cell biology of many other lysosomal proteins. Current research encompassing the fields of enzymology, cell biology, and molecular biology is linking genotypes with the clinical phenotypes of patients with Tay-Sachs and related diseases."

GM2 appears to be a particularly immunogenic ganglioside in humans, as indicated by the presence of naturally occurring IgM anti-GM2 antibodies in approximately 5% of humans and the fact that immunization with irradiated GM2-expressing melanoma cells or purified GM2 adherent to bacillus Calmette-Guérin elicits GM2 antibodies of low to moderate titers in a high proportion of vaccinated patients. To develop vaccines that consistently induce high titers of IgM as well as IgG anti-GM2 antibodies, vaccines containing GM2 conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin as the carrier protein and QS-21 as the adjuvant have been constructed. The serological response of vaccinated patients was monitored by ELISA using purified GM2 ganglioside for IgM and IgG anti-GM2 antibodies and for GM2 cell surface-reactive antibodies by immune adherence assays and cytotoxic tests (IgM antibodies) and mixed hemadsorption assays (IgG antibodies). The majority of vaccinated patients developed IgM and IgG antibodies detectable by ELISA. In most cases, the results of IgM ELISA correlated with assays for cell surface-reactive IgM antibodies. This was not true for IgG anti-GM2 antibodies, where strong discrepancies were seen between high titers in ELISA and little or no reactivity in mixed hemadsorption tests for cell surface-reactive antibodies. These IgG antibodies (and the less frequent IgM antibodies that show similar discrepancies) may be directed against GM2 determinants that are buried, hidden, or not present on GM2-expressing target cells. With regard to a major objective of ganglioside vaccines--i.e., generation of cytotoxic antibodies--the GM2-keyhole limpet hemocyanin/QS-21 vaccine is clearly superior to the previously tested GM2/bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccine. However, variability in patient response and lack of persistence of high-titered IgM cytotoxic antibodies in many patients are problems that remain to be solved."

The most common TSD allele worldwide contains a 4-bp insertion in exon 11 that produces a downstream premature termination codon.

Minigenes of HEXA were constructed and expressed in mouse L cells, to investigate the relationship between the 4-bp insertion and mRNA deficiency. We conclude that the mRNA instability is caused by the premature termination codon and not by a cryptic mutation or by the 4-bp insertion directly and that degradation occurs coincident with or after splicing."

In fibroblasts from the homozygous patient the beta-hexosaminidase alpha mRNA was observed as a nearly undetectable fast migrating band.

Neurons with membranous cytoplasmic bodies (MCBs), identical to those described in Tay-Sachs disease, were identified in the brain of these mice. The neurons with MCBs were periodic acid-Schiff-positive on frozen sections and immunostained with anti-GM2 ganglioside antibody. However, unlike Tay-Sachs disease in which neurons throughout the brain are affected, the localization of storage neurons in these mice appeared to be limited to certain regions, i.e., cerebral cortex, the hippocampus, amygdala, hypothalamus, mammillary nucleus, etc. Storage neurons were absent in the olfactory bulb, cerebellar cortex and spinal anterior horns. The difference in the distribution of storage neurons suggests a difference of ganglioside metabolism between humans and mice.

Initially, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of DNA from the biopsied blastomeres was performed using primers specific for sequences derived from the Y chromosome and this led to the birth of several normal girls. To reduce the risk of misdiagnosis due to amplification failure, PCR based methods for sexing the embryo now employ both X and Y specific sequences, but the preferred method is currently considered to be fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH) with fluorochrome labelled DNA probes to the embryonic nuclei that have been fixed and spread on slides. Dual FISH with probes from X and Y chromosomes allows unequivocal diagnosis of sex and determination of chromosome copy number, avoiding transfer of embryos with abnormal numbers of sex chromosomes, including those with only the maternal X that would be at 50% risk for the X-linked disease. The application of FISH for preimplantation diagnosis has also led to the realisation that chromosomal mosaicism is common at the cleavage stage of development, a finding that has important implications for diagnosis of both dominant single gene disorders and trisomies, as well as for our understanding of early human development. Cloning and sequencing of the relevant genes has enabled the development of methods for the diagnosis of certain recessive single gene disorders in cleavage stage embryos. PCR based methods have to be developed for each condition, sometimes for each family if there is heterogeneity. Preimplantation diagnosis has been successful so far for cystic fibrosis, Tay Sachs disease, and Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. Worldwide, 32 pregnancies have been established following all types of preimplantation diagnosis and with 29 babies born, there is no evidence for any adverse effect on development."

    "abstract": "Tay-Sachs disease, the prototype of the GM2 gangliosidoses, is a catastrophic neurodegenerative disorder of infancy. The disease is caused by mutations in the HEXA gene resulting in an absence of the lysosomal enzyme, beta-hexosaminidase A. As a consequence of the enzyme deficiency, GM2 ganglioside accumulates progressively, beginning early in fetal life, to excessive amounts in the central nervous system. Rapid mental and motor deterioration starting in the first year of life leads to death by 2-4 years of age. Through the targeted disruption of the mouse Hexa gene in embryonic stem cells, we have produced mice with biochemical and neuropathologic features of Tay-Sachs disease. The mutant mice displayed < 1% of normal beta-hexosaminidase A activity and accumulated GM2 ganglioside in their central nervous system in an age-dependent manner. The accumulated ganglioside was stored in neurons as membranous cytoplasmic bodies characteristically found in the neurons of Tay-Sachs disease patients. At 3-5 months of age, the mutant mice showed no apparent defects in motor or memory function. These beta-hexosaminidase A-deficient mice should be useful for devising strategies to introduce functional enzyme and genes into the central nervous system. This model may also be valuable for studying the biochemical and pathologic changes occurring during the course of the disease."

    "abstract": "The history of human genetic lysosomal disorders began in 1881 with the description of what is now known as Tay-Sachs disease. In the early 1960s, when I entered the field while I was a neurology resident, the first phase of studies of lysosomal disorders was being replaced with the second analytical biochemistry phase. Saul Korey, the first Chairman of the Department of Neurology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, initiated the first integrated approach with a team consisting of clinical neurologists, neuropathologists, electron microscopists, cell biologists, organic chemists, and enzymologists. Despite his tragic death in 1963 in his mid-forties, the field flourished along the line of his vision through the third enzymology phase to the fourth and current molecular biology phase. The concept of Tay-Sachs disease as the only ganglioside storage disease has expanded to two forms of gangliosidoses, GM1- and GM2-gangliosidoses, and the latter into three distinct genetic disorders. Tay-Sachs disease, Sandhoff disease and the GM2 activator protein deficiency. More recently, all three genes coding for the three proteins each responsible for distinct genetic forms of GM2-gangliosidosis--beta-hexosaminidase alpha and beta subunits and the GM2 activator protein--have been cloned and many disease-causing mutations have been identified. We have reached the halfway point in our quest for eventual understanding of the pathogenesis and effective treatment of these disorders, starting from the clinical phenotype through biochemistry to the gene. With this new knowledge on the gene level, we should be tracing the route back to enzymology, biology and pathogenetic mechanism of these disorders in the years to come.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

The patients were 0 to 4 years of age; four were female and four were male. Thirteen age-matched controls were also included in the study. In one of the cases, hexosaminidase A activity was found to be 0% (43-82%), while in two other cases beta-galactosidase activity was found to be 5 nmol/h/mg protein (100-1035 nmol/h/mg protein) and arylsulfatase activity was found to be 12 nmol/h/mg protein (106-990 nmol/h/mg protein), respectively. Two more enzymes, alpha-galactosidase (11-39 nmol/h/mg protein) and cerebroside beta-galactosidase (3.7-6.9 nmol/h/mg protein), were also evaluated but were found to be in the normal ranges in these patients. Therefore, these patients were considered to have Tay-Sachs disease, GM1 gangliosidosis and metachromatic leukodystrophy, respectively. The remaining five patients were normal in respect to the five enzyme activities determined. For the prenatal diagnosis of metachromatic leukodystrophy, arylsulfatase A activity was determined in one amniotic cell culture. The activity found in this case was lower than normal (34 nmol/h/mg protein versus 387 nmol/h/mg protein found in three control amniotic cell cultures."

    "abstract": "Due to the limited amount of DNA in a single diploid cell, preimplantation genetic diagnosis has relied on single- or dual-locus analyses in biopsied blastomers. We have applied single-cell whole-genome preamplification to PCR-based analysis of multiple disease loci from the same diploid cell. This method allows diagnosis of multiple disease genes, analysis of multiple exons/introns within a gene, or corroborative embryo-sex assignment and specific mutation detection at sex-linked loci. A blinded study of six genetic loci was performed with whole-genome preamplification followed by nested PCR. Amplification was observed in 103 of 105 assays (98%) and a correct diagnosis was made in 98%. All human blastomeres were correctly diagnosed (100%) at loci where the genotype could be confirmed, attesting to the reliability of the technique. Preamplification has now been applied successfully to the analysis of the two major mutations responsible for Tay-Sachs disease and of a common restriction polymorphism in the gene responsible for hemophilia A. The fidelity and length of product derived from this preamplification step make it an appealing technique for preimplantation genetic diagnoses requiring analyses at more than one locus."

A group of 25 patients who did not elect screening were questioned as to their specific reason for declining Tay Sachs screening. Overall community utilization was 90%. Of the couples who did not elect screening, 64% felt that their risk to have an affected child was too small, 16% could not recall Tay Sachs screening being offered to them, 8% felt that screening was inconvenient.

    "abstract": "Two genes, HEXA and HEXB, encode the alpha- and beta-subunits, respectively, of human beta-hexosaminidase. In the mouse, the corresponding genes are termed Hexa and Hexb. The subunits dimerize to yield three isozymes, beta-hexosaminidase A (alpha beta), B (beta beta), and S (alpha alpha), that have the capacity to degrade a variety of substrates containing beta-linked N-acetylglucosamine and N-acetylgalactosamine residues. Mutations in the HEXA or HEXB gene resulting in a beta-hexosaminidase deficiency cause Tay-Sachs or Sandhoff disease, respectively. As a prelude to the creation of mouse models of these lysosomal storage diseases, we have characterized the molecular biology of the mouse beta-hexosaminidase system. Protein sequences derived from the cloned Hexa and Hexb cDNAs were 55% identical to each other and were also very similar to the cognate human sequences: 84% sequence identity with human HEXA and 75% with HEXB. The mouse hexosaminidase subunits, when expressed in HeLa cells from the cDNAs, displayed specificity toward synthetic substrates similar to the human subunits. The Hexa and Hexb genes were 25 and 22 kb in length, respectively. Each gene was divided into 14 exons, with the positions of introns precisely matching those of the corresponding human genes. The 5' flanking regions of the mouse genes demonstrated promoter activity as ascertained by their ability to drive chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene expression in transfected NIH 3T3 cells. The sequences of these regulatory regions were G+C-rich in the 200 bp upstream of the respective initiator ATGs. Several putative promoter elements were present, including Sp1, AP2, CAAT, and TATA motifs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

    "abstract": "Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the alpha-subunit of beta-hexosaminidase A (HexA). This disease is more prevalent in certain ethnic groups such as Jews of Ashkenazi origin. Three mutations are most commonly found among the latter population: a 4-nucleotide insertion in exon 11, a transversion at the splice site in intron 12, and the adult onset mutation in exon 7. The frequency and distribution of these mutations among Ashkenazi and non-Ashkenazi Jews were examined: 96% of the Ashkenazi carriers bore one of these mutations, while in only 30% of the non-Ashkenazi Jewish carriers were the mutations identified. The percentage distribution of the exon 11:intron 12:exon 7 and unidentified mutant allele(s) was 82:10:4:4 among 152 Ashkenazi carriers, and 16:12:2:70 among non-Ashkenazi Jewish carriers. When the non-Ashkenazi Jewish population was divided into two groups according to the geographical distance from Eastern Europe, it was obvious that the ancestral origin of the subjects bearing the exon 11 allele was predominantly from countries bordering Eastern and Central Europe, such as Turkey, Bulgaria, and Georgia. In carriers from other geographical areas of North Africa and the Middle East, this allele was about fivefold less frequent. The result is compatible with the assumption that this gene, of which the tested individuals were unaware, originates from interethnic marriage in neighboring populations. However, regardless of the ancestral origin, the intron 12 allele was quite evenly distributed throughout the Jewish population.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

    "abstract": "Although some intracellularly distributed glycosphingolipids are reported to be associated with vimentin intermediate filaments or colchicine sensitive cytoskeleton, no direct evidence for such an association has yet been shown. In this report we demonstrated that the intracellularly distributed ganglioside GM2 directly binds to isolated vimentin intermediate filaments in normal and Tay-Sachs disease human fibroblasts. Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy using a GM2-specific monoclonal antibody demonstrated filamentously distributed GM2 in the cytoplasm. A double staining of Tay-Sachs fibroblasts with anti-GM2 and anti-vimentin monoclonal antibodies strongly suggested that the GM2 positive filaments are vimentin intermediate filaments. We then isolated vimentin, in the presence of a detergent and urea, from the normal human skin fibroblasts and murine mastocytoma cells. In a solid phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, the isolated vimentin dose-dependently reacted with both anti-vimentin and anti-GM2 monoclonal antibodies but not with anti-GM3 or anti-GM1 monoclonal antibody. The molar ratio of GM2 to vimentin was approximately 20:1. The lipid fraction extracted from the purified vimentin preparation was immunostained with anti-GM2 on a thin-layer chromatography plate. Furthermore, only one band was detected at the molecular weight of 57 kDa, after electroblotting and simultaneous immunostaining with anti-GM2 and anti-vimentin monoclonal antibodies. These results clearly indicated that ganglioside GM2 directly binds to vimentin."

In tissue culture, normal cells hydrolyzed cell-incorporated GM2 while fibroblasts from patients with GM2 gangliosidosis did not. The half life of GM2 in normal fibroblasts was 78 hours. In vitro, only normal fibroblast extracts hydrolyzed GM2 in the absence of additives. In the presence of 10 mM sodium taurocholate, rates of GM2 hydrolysis by normal fibroblast extracts were increased 5-16-fold, fibroblast extracts from AB and B1 variant patients hydrolyzed GM2 at normal rates, cell extracts from patients with Tay-Sachs disease hydrolyzed GM2 at nearly normal rates, and cell extracts from Sandhoff disease patients hydrolyzed GM2 at about 10% of normal rates. In the presence of 1 microgram of GM2 activator, rates of GM2 hydrolysis by normal fibroblast extracts were increased 8-25-fold, fibroblast extracts from a patient with the AB variant hydrolyzed GM2 at normal rates, and cell extracts from other variants of GM2 gangliosidosis did not hydrolyze GM2. The results suggest that measuring the persistence of 3H-GM2 in tissue culture over time will detect any variant of GM2 gangliosidosis and may be the ideal way to test for the presence of this disease. Variants can be distinguished by assaying the hydrolysis of 3H-GM2 using cell extracts in the absence of additives, with sodium taurocholate, and with activator."

    "abstract": "The determination of hexosaminidases A and B in most programmes for Tay-Sachs disease carrier detection is based on their different heat sensitivity (hexosaminidase A is the heat labile isoenzyme). This routine cannot be employed for individuals who also possess a thermolabile hexosaminidase B. In Israel, 0.6% of the screened samples have a labile hexosaminidases B (about 110 each year) and the assessment of their hexosaminidase A activity has hitherto been based on isoenzyme separation by ion exchange chromatography. The latter requires relative large serum samples, and the individuals must usually be reappointed. In order to avoid the thermal treatment we have used the alternative technique, which employs two substrates with different specificities for the two isoenzymes: 1. The fluorogenic substance, 4-methylumbelliferyl-N-acetyl-glucopyranoside, which measures total hexosaminidase activity and 2. the derivative, 4-methylumbelliferyl-N-acetyl glucosamine-6-sulphate, which is considerably more specific toward hexosaminidase A. Hexosaminidase A activity was expressed as a ratio of total activities (the ratio of the assay with 4-methylumbelliferyl-N-acetyl glucosamine-6-sulphate to that with 4-methyllumbelliferyl-N-acetyl-glucopyranoside). Using the results from 65 obligate heterozygotes for Tay-Sachs disease, we established our reference ranges for assigning the genotypes with respect to the Tay-Sachs gene. Comparison of the results from 182 unrelated and randomly chosen sera screened by the ratio method and by heat inactivation, showed a very high correlation (r = 0.996). Sixty eight sera with thermolabile hexosaminidase B were tested by ion exchange chromatography and by the double substrate method, and they yielded identical diagnoses with regard to the Tay-Sachs locus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Signs and symptoms characterizing the candidate illnesses were systematically queried by the family history method. Rates and relative risks for symptoms characterizing these disorders and for several nonautosomal illnesses associated with TSD and/or GD (i.e., amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Hodgkin's disease, leukemia and lymphoma) are significantly elevated in the schizophrenia pedigrees, compared to controls. The conditions with elevated rates and risks have been associated with chromosomal regions 1q21 and 15q23-q24.

After first strand synthesis by random priming, PCR was used to amplify in two overlapping fragments (868 and 949 bp) the entire coding region. These amplified products were first studied for changes in size by agarose gel electrophoresis to screen for splicing mutations leading to exon skipping or cryptic splice site activation. For each patient, the two overlapping cDNA fragments were subjected to chemical mismatch cleavage analysis using hydroxylamine to modify C-containing mismatches and osmium tetroxide to modify T-containing mismatches. DGGE was used to screen for mutations in the coding region spanning exon 2 to exon 6, a region putatively encompassing the active site and therefore a potential hot spot of mutations associated with Tay-Sachs disease. To increase the sensitivity of the technique, a 30 bp GC-clamp has been added at the 5' end of the sense oligonucleotide to amplify a fragment of 629 bp. The computerized analysis found that single base changes in domain spanning from nt 313 to nt 693 can be distinguished.

Hexosaminidase A activity, studied in leukocytes, was profoundly deficient when measured using the specific sulfated substrate, but nearly normal using a conventional assay (non-sulfated substrate). These results established the diagnosis of the unusual enzymological form of GM2-gangliosidosis known as the B1 variant, which had so far not been associated with an adult phenotype. Molecular studies are in progress to study genotype/phenotype correlations in this family in comparison with known mutations in the B1 variant and in adult GM2-gangliosidosis.

More than half (56.0%) of the rabbis discussed health issues as a routine part of premarital counseling, and 22.3% had counseled a couple after prenatal diagnosis of an abnormal fetus. Orthodox rabbis were more likely than rabbis from other branches of Judaism to have contacted medical personnel in these cases, and they reported more involvement in helping families after the birth of a child with a hereditary condition or birth defect. However, a majority (90.9%) of rabbis from all branches would refer such a family for genetic counseling. Ninety-four rabbis (53.7%) discussed Tay-Sachs carrier testing with congregants. These rabbis tended to be Reform, to be younger, and to have fewer years in the rabbinate. Reform rabbis also scored significantly higher than did Orthodox or Conservative rabbis on knowledge questions about Jewish genetic diseases and were more active in distributing pertinent literature to congregants. Even though nearly 90% of the sample viewed counseling on genetic issues as part of their rabbinical role, most rabbis, even those who actually counseled on these issues, felt poorly prepared to do so.

However, healthy individuals lacking Hex A activity against synthetic substrates (i.e., individuals who are pseudodeficient) have been described. Recently, an apparently benign C739-to-T (Arg247Trp) mutation was found among individuals with Hex A levels indistinguishable from those of carriers of Tay-Sachs disease. This allele, when in compound heterozygosity with a second \"disease-causing\" allele, results in Hex A pseudodeficiency. We examined the HEXA gene of a healthy 42-year-old who was Hex A deficient but did not have the C739-to-T mutation. The HEXA exons were PCR amplified, and the products were analyzed for mutations by using restriction-enzyme digestion or single-strand gel electrophoresis. A G805-to-A (Gly269Ser) mutation associated with adult-onset GM2 gangliosidosis was found on one chromosome. A new mutation, C745-to-T (Arg249Trp), was identified on the second chromosome. This mutation was detected in an additional 4/63 (6%) non-Jewish and 0/218 Ashkenazi Jewish enzyme-defined carriers. Although the Arg249Trp change may result in a late-onset form of GM2 gangliosidosis, any phenotype must be very mild. This new mutation and the benign C739-to-T mutation together account for approximately 38% of non-Jewish enzyme-defined carriers. Because carriers of the C739-to-T and C745-to-T mutations cannot be differentiated from carriers of disease-causing alleles by using the classical biochemical screening approaches, DNA-based analyses for these mutations should be offered for non-Jewish enzyme-defined heterozygotes, before definitive counseling is provided."

A total of 2416 pregnancies at increased risk for TSD were monitored by amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling. A dramatic decrease in the incidence of TSD in the Jewish populations was demonstrated. With both serum and leukocyte proficiency testing, there have been only 16 instances (of 845 cumulative laboratory evaluations) of one or more errors reported by a laboratory since 1983 resulting in nonaccreditation. This analysis represents a prototypic effort in coordinating adult education, carrier testing, and genetic counseling directed toward prospective prevention of a uniformly fatal childhood disease and demonstrates that such an effort can dramatically affect disease incidence."

Genetic deficiency of GM2 activator leads to a neurological disorder, an atypical form of Tay-Sachs disease (GM2 gangliosidosis variant AB). Here, we describe a G506 to C transversion (Arg169 to Pro) in the mRNA of an infantile patient suffering from GM2-gangliosidosis variant AB. Using the polymerase chain reaction amplification and direct-sequencing technique, we found the patient to be homozygous for the mutation, whereas the parents were, as expected, heterozygous. BHK cells transfected with a construct of mutant cDNA gave no GM2 activator protein detectable by the Western blotting technique, whereas those transfected by a wild-type cDNA construct showed a significant level of human GM2 activator protein. The substitution of proline for the normal Arg169 therefore appears to result in premature degradation of the mutant GM2 activator, either during the post-translational processing steps or after reaching the lysosome. The basis for the phenotype of GM2 gangliosidosis variant AB may therefore be either inactivation of the physiological activator function by the point mutation or instability of the mutant protein."

This article summarizes some of the recent research on germ-line gene modification in animal models. Certain monogenic deficiency diseases that ultimately might be candidates for correction by germ-line intervention are identified. Several of the most frequently considered ethical issues relative to human germ-line gene modification are considered in the context of professional ethics, parental responsibility, and public policy. Finally, it is suggested that there is merit in continuing the discussion about human germ-line intervention, so that this technique can be carefully compared with alternative strategies for preventing genetic disease."

    "title": "Tay-Sachs disease screening and diagnosis: evolving technologies.",
    "abstract": "Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) is an autosomal recessive, progressive, and fatal neurodegenerative disorder. Within the last 25 years, the discovery of the enzymatic basis of the disease, the deficiency of the enzyme hexosaminidase A, has made possible both enzymatic diagnosis of TSD and heterozygote identification. TSD is the first genetic condition for which a community-based heterozygote screening program was attempted with the intention of reducing the incidence of a genetic disease. In this article we review the clinical, biochemical, and molecular features of TSD as well as the development of laboratory technology that has been deployed in community genetic screening programs. We describe the assay procedures used and some of the limitations in their accuracy. We consider the impact of DNA-based technology on the process of identification of individuals carrying mutant genes associated with TSD and we discuss the social context within which genetic screening occurs."

    "abstract": "We describe late infantile Tay-Sachs disease with high residual hexosaminidase A activity in two siblings of a Syrian Druze family. The patients' leukocytes had 26% of normal hexosaminidase A activity when tested with the conventional fluorogenic substrate 4-methyl-umbelliferyl-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-beta-D-glucopyranoside (4-MUG) and only about 10% when assayed with the sulfated substrate, 4-methyl-umbelliferal- beta-N-acetyl-glucosamine-6-sulfate (4-MUGS). According to the standard procedure of the heterozygote screening program (employing 4-MUG and heat inactivation), the parents were not diagnosed as an at-risk couple since the father was classified as a noncarrier. However, both parents' levels were clearly within the carrier range on the basis of 4-MUGS. The unique catalytic characteristics of the patients' enzyme forward the assumption that the affected sibs are B1 variants. The parents' enzymatic levels, together with their known consanguinity, might indicate that these patients are homozygotes for the rare mutation and not genetic compounds as has been documented for most of the infantile B1 variants. To the best of our knowledge this is the first reported case of B1 variant in a child of that extraction."

    "abstract": "GM2-gangliosidosis is a group of neurological disorders resulting from genetically defective catabolism, and consequent abnormal accumulation, of GM2-ganglioside. Three major types are distinguished: the B variant (Tay-Sachs disease), the O variant (Sandhoff disease), and the AB variant, caused by genetic abnormalities in the genes coding for the beta-hexosaminidase alpha- or beta-subunit, or the GM2-activator protein, respectively. A number of gene abnormalities responsible for Tay-Sachs disease have already been identified and the correlation between the beta-hexosaminidase alpha gene abnormality and the clinical phenotype has been explained in many cases. In the severest phenotype of Tay-Sachs disease (infantile form), mRNA of beta-hexosaminidase alpha subunit is not produced or is unstable such as in French Canadian patients or in Jewish patients with infantile Tay-Sachs disease, or the polypeptide does not have any catalytic activities because of the alteration of glycosylation such as the mutation of Glu482-to-Lys found in a Italian patient or the altered structure of polypeptide. The mutation identified in a large majority of the Japanese infantile Tay-Sachs disease patients, which is a G-to-T substitution at 3'-end of intron 5, generates a short mRNA with complete skipping of exon 6 and a polypeptide lacking 34 amino acids is generated but catalytically inactive. On the other hand, some active alpha beta dimers must be generated in patients with milder phenotypes of Tay-Sachs disease such as Gly269-to-Ser mutation in an adult form. Some of the mutations appear in high frequency among certain ethnic groups such as Ashkenazi Jewish patients and French Canadians.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

    "abstract": "Tay-Sachs disease (TSD), an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative condition, is the result of a deficiency of beta-hexosaminidase A (hex A). Heterozygotic individuals are screened by analysis for hex A and hex B activities; the percent of hex A is the critical determinant of carrier vs noncarrier status. Most laboratories use a heat-inactivation assay that exploits the differential thermolability of the isoenzymes. However, we have found a reciprocal relation between the apparent leukocyte hex A activity and the amount of the sample used in the assay; i.e., a significant increase in the percent of hex A activity with decreasing amounts of sample. Three sets of data indicate that this phenomenon was caused by an effect on the hex B isoenzyme and not on hex A. This variation in hex A activity with sample amount was not observed when a hex A-specific substrate was used. This phenomenon was also not seen in assays of leukocytes from carriers for Sandhoff disease, a condition associated with a reduction in the amount of hex B. Finally, when leukocytes from a TSD homozygote, containing almost no hex A, were analyzed, marked increases in the percent of hex A were observed with decreasing sample concentrations. These data indicate that misdiagnoses could result from variations in sample concentrations used for TSD carrier testing and support the view that the leukocyte concentrations used for these assays should be standardized."

Medical records of patients undergoing amniocentesis for genetic diagnosis were reviewed. Three hundred twenty-nine of 537 charts evaluated were from individuals at risk for Tay-Sachs heterozygosity. Among these, 213 couples had previously been screened for Tay-Sachs. In 116 couples, neither member of the couple had been screened before amniocentesis. A concurrent reference group consisted of 208 couples without an indication for Tay-Sachs screening. Patient characteristics, including ethnicity, genetic screening history, parental ages, and pregnancy history, were reviewed for each group. Analysis of variance and likelihood chi 2 test were used for statistical analysis. There were no significant differences in maternal age or reproductive history among the groups. The most common indication for amniocentesis was advanced maternal age for all three groups. However, the previously screened group was more than twice as likely to self-refer because of a positive family history or patient anxiety than was the unscreened group (P = .006). Conversely, the unscreened group was more than twice as likely as screened couples to be referred because of a positive high or positive low maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein level (P = .002). Despite 2 decades of professional and lay education, many couples are unaware of their individual risk for Tay-Sachs heterozygosity. Additional education, most likely at the professional level, is needed to maximize informed participation."

    "abstract": "A screening program for the detection of Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) carriers in the ultra Orthodox community of Ashkenazi Jews has operated in Israel since 1986. The purpose of this program is the prevention of marriages of 2 heterozygotes. The screened individuals are mostly couples in the engagement process or students in religious high schools. Two mandatory requirements guide this program. First, anonymity of the tested individuals who are identified only by code numbers; second completion of the test results of couples in the engagement process within a few days. The screening program is performed by the determination of hexosaminidase A (Hex A) activity in serum which is repeated in serum and leukocyte extracts in couples where both partners were found in the heterozygote range in the initial tests. The minimal carrier frequency was estimated to be 1:26 or higher, which is higher then in the general Jewish Ashkenazi population. This higher carrier frequency apparently stems from the fact that most members of this community originate from central Europe where the TSD carrier frequency was previously reported to be the highest in the Ashkenazi population. Since the beginning of the screening program no TSD child has been born to newlywed couples of this community in Israel."

    "abstract": "In vitro mutagenesis and transient expression in COS cells has been used to associate a missense mutation with a clinical or biochemical phenotype. Mutations affecting the alpha-subunit of beta-hexosaminidase A (alpha beta) (E.C.3.2.1.52) result in Tay-Sachs disease. Because hexosaminidase A is heterodimeric, analysis of alpha-chain mutations is not straightforward. We examine three approaches utilizing previously identified mutations affecting alpha-chain folding. These involve transfection of (1) the alpha cDNA alone; (2) a beta cDNA construct encoding a beta-subunit substituted at a position homologous to that of the alpha-subunit, and (3) both alpha and beta cDNAs. The latter two procedures amplified residual activity levels over that of patient samples, an effect not previously found with mutations affecting an \"active\" alpha Arg residue. This effect may help to discriminate between protein-folding and active-site mutations. We conclude that, with proper controls, the latter method of cotransfection can be used to evaluate the effects and perhaps to predict the clinical course of some alpha-chain mutations. Using this technique, we demonstrate that the adult-onset Tay-Sachs mutation, alpha Gly --> Ser269, does not directly affect alpha beta dimerization but exerts an indirect effect on the dimer through destabilizing the folded alpha-subunit at physiological temperatures. Two other alpha mutations linked to more severe phenotypes appear to inhibit the initial folding of the subunit."

    "abstract": "Developments in DNA technology have resulted in a dramatic increase in the number of genes identified. With the localisation of a gene it is possible to devise procedures suitable for mass carrier screening programmes. Until recently mass carrier screening was only possible for a limited number of disorders, for example, Tay-Sachs disease and haemoglobinopathies. Counselling possible carriers was based on estimations of risk. The momentum towards mass carrier screening is likely to be increased by gene therapy. Carrier screening for cystic fibrosis alone will have dramatic implications for genetic service provision as 4 to 5% of the UK population carry the CF gene. The potential for genetic screening of multifactorial diseases, for example, cancers, should also be considered. The existing organisation of genetic services is likely to be inadequate. A new specialty of clinical population genetics is required. A model is proposed of clinical population genetic screening programmes, organised under a 'common umbrella' led by a public health physician, while screening and follow up will remain the responsibility of the appropriate clinician."

Here we report the observation of a German/Hungarian boy aged 12 when he died with a prolonged course of a neurodegenerative disorder, later biochemically identified as a GM2 gangliosidosis B1-variant which is characterized by a deficient Hex A activity only against 4MUGS. The first clinical symptoms had occurred after the age of 14 months with a clear manifestation of the disease at age 3, when he presented disturbances of movement and tended to fall down. The slowly progressive course with brain atrophy, seizures and severe mental deterioration resulted in death after almost 9 years. At autopsy, the typical light microscopic neuronal changes of a \"lysosomal storage disorder\" were found, with multilamellar concentric bodies (MCB) and Zebra bodies in the neuronal cytoplasm at the electron microscopic level."

No Hex A activity was detected in the sera of patients with TSD. The activities of Hex A in the obligate carriers of TSD and SHD tended to be lower (nonsignificantly) than in the control group. Hex B activities tended to be higher in TSD patients as well as in carriers of TSD, although the mean activities did not significantly differ from the corresponding mean for the control group. However, Hex B activities were decreased in the carriers of SHD in comparison with the other groups. Sera from 900 postmenopausal women, all of age 55 years, were also analyzed for Hex isoenzymes; the results indicated a carrier frequency of about 1 in 200 for both TSD and SHD.

The mutation causes a splicing abnormality, and the resultant mRNA lacks the exon 6 sequence. Northern blot analysis showed a single band of mRNA, distinctly shorter in size and slightly smaller in quantity than normal. Since exon 6 consists of 102 nucleotides, the mRNA should generate a beta-hexosaminidase alpha-subunit missing 34 amino acids in the middle but otherwise normal in the primary structure. It must be catalytically inactive or unstable, or both. The high frequency of this mutation among the Japanese patients with the infantile form of Tay-Sachs disease and its apparent absence outside of Japan suggests that this mutation may have originated in Japan."

Sensitive fluorescent or fluorogenic procedures provided indications that Tay-Sachs, Gaucher and Krabbe diseases might be diagnosed in one human blastomere, while for Niemann-Pick disease two might be required. Secondly, pyrene lipids were administered into murine embryos and their fluorescence was quantified by computerized imaging microscopy. As a model of Gaucher disease, the fluorescent substrate pyrene glucosylceramide was administered into murine embryos in the presence or absence of an inhibitor of the enzyme beta-glucosidase. Because of decreased degradation of the substrate in enzyme-inhibited cells, the fluorescence per blastomere was considerably greater relative to those which received no inhibitor. The results indicated that lipid storage diseases might be diagnosed in single human blastomeres at the preimplantation stage, obviating the need for pre-natal diagnosis and abortion of affected foetuses."

The patient was a compound heterozygote with each allele of the HEX A gene containing a different mutation in exon 1. One of these is a T to C transition in the initiation codon, expected to produce no alpha subunit and therefore a classical infantile phenotype. The unusual clinical aspects and later onset in the patient must therefore be a result of residual hexosaminidase A activity associated with a mutant alpha subunit containing the second mutation, substitution of serine for proline at amino acid 25 owing to a C to T change at nucleotide 73. Western blotting and DE-52 ion exchange chromatography have been used to examine the behaviour of this mutant alpha subunit."

A study was undertaken to determine whether mutation analysis would be useful in TSD screening programs in identifying carriers and clarifying the status of individuals whose enzyme assays are inconclusive. Ashkenazi Jewish individuals who had been diagnosed as carriers, inconclusives by enzyme assay and non-carriers with low normal enzyme levels in the Mount Sinai Tay-Sachs Disease Prevention Program were examined for the presence of the three mutations using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and allele specific oligonucleotide (ASO) hybridization.

Cultured human fibroblasts from a compound heterozygote for this transition (and for a deletion mutation) produce no detectable HEXA mRNA. The intron 7 + 1 mutation occurs in the base adjacent to the site of the adult-onset TSD mutation (G805A). In both mutations a restriction site for the endonuclease EcoRII is abolished. Unambiguous diagnosis, therefore, requires allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization to distinguish between these two mutant alleles. The intron 7 + 1 mutation has been detected in three unrelated families. Obligate heterozygotes for the intron 7 + 1 mutation were born in the Saguenay-Lac-St-Jean region of Quebec. The most recent ancestors common to obligate carriers of this mutation were from the Charlevoix region of the province of Quebec.

The third mutation is a two base deletion occurring in exon 8 involving the loss of either nts 927-928 or 929-930 in codon 310. The deletion creates an inframe termination codon 35 bases downstream. The Arg170Trp mutation was also detected in a third unrelated TSD patient. In both families this allele was traced to French Canadian ancestors originating in the Estrie region of the province of Quebec. This mutation is the third TSD allele unique to the French Canadian population and the ancestral origins of the carrier parents are distant from the center of diffusion of the more common 7.6 kb deletion mutation which is in the eastern part of the province."

    "abstract": "The insulin-like growth factor-II/mannose-6-phosphate receptor binds two classes of ligands, IGF-II and lysosomal enzymes containing the mannose-6-phosphate recognition marker. To study the interaction of the two classes of ligands at the receptor level, we have isolated 'high uptake' forms of lysosomal enzymes containing mannose-6-phosphate that had been radiolabeled biosynthetically using a tissue culture model: Tay-Sachs disease fibroblasts were incubated in medium containing [3H]mannose, ammonium chloride and mannose-6-phosphate. Under the conditions of these experiments, the Tay-Sachs disease fibroblasts synthesized and secreted radiolabeled hexosaminidase B, as confirmed by measuring enzymatic activity of cell-conditioned medium. The enzyme secreted was recognized by antibodies raised against purified hexosaminidase A and B but not by nonimmune control sera in Western blotting and immunoprecipitation experiments. The radiolabeled cell-conditioned medium was partially purified by ion-exchange chromatography on a DEAE-Sephadex column. When partially purified [3H]hexosaminidase B was incubated with rat C6 glial cells which express large numbers of IGF-II/mannose-6-phosphate receptors, the enzyme was taken up specifically via the IGF-II/mannose-6-phosphate receptor as evidenced by carbohydrate competition experiments. The specific uptake of the radiolabeled lysosomal enzyme was partially inhibited by IGF-II and an antibody against the IGF-II/mannose-6-phosphate receptor (No. 3637). We conclude that the cellular uptake of a biosynthetically labeled lysosomal enzyme, hexosaminidase B, is partially inhibited by IGF-II. We hypothesize that IGF-II might be capable of modulating lysosomal pathways in vivo."

    "abstract": "Tay-Sachs disease (TSD, GM2 gangliosidosis, Type I) is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease caused by deficiency of beta-hexosaminidase A (Hex A) resulting from mutations in the gene (HEXA) encoding the alpha-subunit of the enzyme. Three mutations, in exons 7 and 11 and at the exon 12-intron 12 junction, account for > 90% of alleles identified in obligate Ashkenazi Jewish carriers. Mutation analysis requires amplification of available DNA by separate polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) and either restriction digestion and gel electrophoresis or 32P-labeled allele-specific oligonucleotide (ASO) probes. We developed a simple, nonradioisotopic method for rapidly identifying TSD carriers by a triplex PCR reaction followed by dot-blot analysis, using three wild-type and three mutant ASOs end-labeled with digoxigenin-dUTP (dig-ASO). Hybridization was demonstrated immunologically by reaction with an anti-digoxigenin-alkaline phosphatase conjugate followed by colorimetric demonstration of phosphatase activity. The results of analyses by the dig-ASO method of 65 carriers identified by serum enzyme activity and of 6 high-risk fetuses in prenatal testing were the same as those obtained by more conventional restriction analysis. Dig-ASO testing correctly reclassified 10 individuals who had tested inconclusively on analysis for leukocyte beta-hexosaminidase A activity; 3 were identified as carriers and 7 as noncarriers. The simplicity of the assay and the avoidance of the radioisotopes make this a potentially useful method for TSD carrier detection by mutation analysis in Ashkenazi Jews from populations in whom the identity and frequencies of the common TSD mutations are known."

    "abstract": "A study was undertaken to characterize the mutation(s) responsible for Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) in a Cajun population in southwest Louisiana and to identify the origins of these mutations. Eleven of 12 infantile TSD alleles examined in six families had the beta-hexosaminidase A (Hex A) alpha-subunit exon 11 insertion mutation that is present in approximately 70% of Ashkenazi Jewish TSD heterozygotes. The mutation in the remaining allele was a single-base transition in the donor splice site of the alpha-subunit intron 9. To determine the origins of these two mutations in the Cajun population, the TSD carrier status was enzymatically determined for 90 members of four of the six families, and extensive pedigrees were constructed for all carriers. A single ancestral couple from France was found to be common to most of the carriers of the exon 11 insertion. Pedigree data suggest that this mutation has been in the Cajun population since its founding over 2 centuries ago and that it may be widely distributed within the population. In contrast, the intron 9 mutation apparently was introduced within the last century and probably is limited to a few Louisiana families."

    "abstract": "beta-N-acetylhexosaminidase is a lysosomal enzyme, which has two isoenzymes: beta-Hex A, a trimer consisting of one alpha-chain and two beta-chains (alpha beta 2) and beta-Hex B, a tetramer formed of four beta-chains (beta 2 beta 2). Genetic defects in the alpha-chain lead to Tay-Sachs disease, whereas mutations in the beta-chain gene lead to Sandhoff disease. In a previous study we developed a microassay for total beta-N-acetylhexosaminidase and used this for measuring activities in mouse oocytes and preimplantation embryos. In this study, to assess the feasibility of transferring this technique to the human for the purposes of preimplantation diagnosis for Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff disease, beta-Hex activity was assayed in human oocytes and embryos and in the medium in which they had been cultured. We showed that although the activity of beta-N-acetylhexosaminidase in human oocytes and embryos was > 500 times higher than in the mouse, it was not detectable in the culture medium and the activity in oocytes and embryos remained virtually constant throughout human preimplantation development, making it difficult to distinguish embryonic from maternal enzyme activity. In the absence of this distinction it would be inappropriate to use beta-N-acetylhexosaminidase activity for the purposes of preimplantation diagnosis of Sandhoff or Tay-Sachs disease. These experiments demonstrate that measuring the beta-N-acetylhexosaminidase activity in human embryos cannot be used at present for preimplantation diagnosis."

Most previously reported B1 variant mutations were found in exon 5 within codon 178. The coding sequence of the alpha subunit gene of a patient with the B1 variant form was examined with a combination of reverse transcription of mRNA to cDNA, PCR, and dideoxy sequencing. A double mutation in exon 6 has been identified: a G574----C transversion causing a val192----leu change and a G598----A transition resulting in a val200----met alteration. The amplified cDNAs were otherwise normal throughout their sequence. The 574 and 598 alterations have been confirmed by amplification directly from genomic DNA from the patient and her mother. Transient-expression studies of the two exon 6 mutations (singly or together) in COS-1 cells show that the G574----C change is sufficient to cause the loss of enzyme activity. The biochemical phenotype of the 574 alteration in transfection studies is consistent with that expected for a B1 variant mutation. As such, this mutation differs from previously reported B1 variant mutations, all of which occur in exon 5."

In the brain and spinal cord of all the patients except for an adult GM1 gangliosidosis patient, abnormal accumulation of the lipids was observed, though the concentration in the fetal tissue was low. In GM2 gangliosidosis, the amounts of lyso GM2 ganglioside accumulated in the brain were similar among the patient with Sandhoff disease and the patients with Tay-Sachs disease, whereas the concentration of asialo lyso GM2 ganglioside in the brain was higher in the former patient than in the latter patients. By comparing the sphingoid bases of neutral sphingolipids, gangliosides, and lysosphingolipids, it was suggested that lysosphingolipids in the diseased tissue are synthesized by sequential glycosylation from free sphingoid bases, but not by deacylation of the sphingolipids. Because lysosphingolipids are known to be cytotoxic, the abnormally accumulated lysophingolipids may well be the pathogenetic agent for the neuronal degeneration in gangliosidoses."

However, healthy subjects found to be deficient in Hex A activity (i.e., pseudodeficient) by means of in vitro biochemical tests have been described. We analyzed the HEXA gene of one pseudodeficient subject and identified both a C739-to-T substitution that changes Arg247----Trp on one allele and a previously identified Tay-Sachs disease mutation on the second allele. Six additional pseudodeficient subjects were found to have the C739-to-T mutation. This allele accounted for 32% (20/62) of non-Jewish enzyme-defined Tay-Sachs disease carriers but for none of 36 Jewish enzyme-defined carriers who did not have one of three known mutations common to this group. The C739-to-T allele, together with a \"true\" Tay-Sachs disease allele, causes Hex A pseudodeficiency. Given both the large proportion of non-Jewish carriers with this allele and that standard biochemical screening cannot differentiate between heterozygotes for the C739-to-T mutations and Tay-Sachs disease carriers, DNA testing for this mutation in at-risk couples is essential. This could prevent unnecessary or incorrect prenatal diagnoses."

This technique can detect any single-base difference that might occur including previously unknown mutations or polymorphisms. Two technical limitations of the original procedure have now been addressed. First, switching to Thermococcus litoralis DNA polymerase has eliminated variability believed to be due to the addition of an extra, non-templated base to the 3' end of DNA by Taq DNA polymerase. Second, with the analogs used in the original study, the mobility shift induced by a single base change can usually be resolved only in DNA segments 200 nt or smaller. This size limitation has been overcome by synthesizing biotinylated nucleotides with extraordinarily long linker arms (36 atom backbone). Using these new analogs and conventional sequencing gels (0.4 mm thick), mutations in the human beta-hexosaminidase alpha and CYP2D6 genes have been detected in DNA segments up to 300 nt in length. By using very thin (0.15 mm) gels, single-base polymorphisms in the human APOE gene have been detected in 500-nt segments."

We found that in all cases, irrespective of the nature of the storage material or disorder, only a minor proportion of neurons (20-30% at most), as a rule, moderately reacted with the Ub antibody, while the majority of the distended neurons neither expressed Ub nor NF epitopes. These findings suggest that the UB dependent proteolytic pathway may play a secondary role in the lysosomal storage disorders, at least in the advanced stages which are observed at autopsy. It seems that the Ub expression of a minor proportion of neurons should be regarded as an unspecific epiphenomenon rather than as a mechanism of major significance in the basic metabolism of these disorders, in which the inclusions consist of membrane-bound lipid material."

    "abstract": "In the absence of treatments for most inborn errors of metabolism, the goal of both geneticists and health care providers has been the prevention of disease through identification of at-risk couples. When the enzyme deficiency responsible for a disorder is known, heterozygotes can frequently be identified by enzyme assay. The presence or absence of specific mutations in the genes coding for these enzymes may be determined directly if the gene of interest has been identified and characterized. Because the inherited metabolic disorders are rare, these approaches are useful only for individuals with a family history of a specific disease or for populations in which the gene frequency for a specific disease is increased. Tay-Sachs disease is a fatal, autosomal recessive, metabolic disease caused by deficient activity of the lysosomal enzyme Hex A. Although it is rare in the general population, in which the heterozygote frequency is approximately 1/167, it is elevated in a few populations, including the Ashkenazi Jewish community, in which the heterozygote frequency is 1/30. The ability to detect TSD heterozygotes reliably and to diagnose TSD prenatally using a simple and rapid enzyme assay has made prevention of this disorder possible through education and carrier screening. The identification of specific TSD mutations at the DNA level enables laboratories to provide more accurate screening and diagnosis in some families. The success of TSD screening in the Ashkenazi Jewish population has made it the prototype for screening among the inborn errors of metabolism. The TSD example becomes increasingly relevant as heterozygote detection becomes possible for other genetic disorders that are increased in well-defined populations. Cystic fibrosis is such a disease in the caucasian population."

This is an unexpected result considering the diverse origin of the population of the British Isles. This mutation was not found in 28 control UK subjects or 11 Jewish carriers of known TSD mutations.

It is well known that an elevated frequency of TSD mutations exists among Ashkenazi Jews. More recently it has become apparent that elevated carrier frequencies for TSD also occur in several other ethnic groups, including Moroccan Jews, a subgroup of Sephardic Jews. Elsewhere we reported an in-frame deletion of one of the two adjacent phenylalanine codons at position 304 or 305 (delta F304/305) in one HEXA allele of a Moroccan Jewish TSD patient and in three obligate carriers from six unrelated Moroccan Jewish families. We have now identified two additional mutations within exon 5 of the HEXA gene that account for the remaining TSD alleles in the patient and carriers. One of the mutations is a novel C-to-G transversion, resulting in a replacement of Tyr180 by a stop codon. The other mutation is a G-to-A transition resulting in an Arg170-to-Gln substitution. This mutation is at a CpG site in a Japanese infant with Tay-Sachs disease and was described elsewhere. Analysis of nine obligate carriers from seven unrelated families showed that four harbor the delta F304/305 mutation, two the Arg170----Gln mutation, and one the Tyr180----Stop mutation. We also have developed rapid, nonradioactive assays for the detection of each mutation, which should be helpful for carrier screening."

We have identified the sites of N-linked glycosylation and oligosaccharide phosphorylation on the alpha-subunit of beta-hexosaminidase and have determined the influence of the oligosaccharides on the folding and transport of the enzyme. The potential glycosylation sequences, either singly or in combination, were eliminated through site-directed mutagenesis of the cDNA. By expression of the mutant cDNAs in COS-1 cells, each of the three glycosylation sites on the alpha-subunit was found to be modified by an oligosaccharide. One of the three oligosaccharides was the preferred site of phosphorylation. The absence of any individual oligosaccharide did not diminish the expression of the catalytic activity associated with the alpha-chain, implying proper folding and assembly of subunits. A profound effect was observed, however, when all three oligosaccharides were absent. The unglycosylated alpha-subunit, resulting from genetic alteration of all three glycosylation sites or synthesis of the wild-type protein in the presence of tunicamycin, was catalytically inactive. It was found to be improperly folded into an insoluble aggregate, linked through inappropriate disulfide bonds. The unglycosylated protein was trapped in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum and was found in a complex with the Ig heavy chain-binding protein, BiP. The properties of the nonglycosylated, misfolded alpha-subunit were similar to some mutant alpha-subunits in Tay-Sachs disease patients. The results indicate that the oligosaccharides are essential, although not in a site-specific manner, for proper folding and cellular transport of the alpha-subunit."

Fifteen different lysosomal storage diseases accounted for 81 per cent of the biochemical prenatal diagnoses performed, with 57 per cent of these pregnancies at risk for Tay-Sachs disease. No errors were made in the biochemical diagnoses that predicted affected or unaffected fetuses. However, the diagnoses of certain disorders (e.g., mucopolysacchariodosis type IH, metachromatic leukodystrophy, and Krabbe disease) occasionally required confirmatory studies in cultured amniocytes because the enzyme results were inconclusive in direct and/or cultured villi or due to the presence of a pseudodeficiency allele. Of these, only the diagnosis of a fetus at risk for Krabbe disease remained inconclusive after special studies to discriminate between mutant and pseudo-deficiency alleles. Recombinant DNA techniques were used to predict the diagnosis of 318 fetuses at risk for 16 different disorders in which the defective disease gene could be detected either directly or by linkage analysis to a nearby polymorphic marker. Of these, 32 per cent were for haemoglobinopathies, 25 per cent for cystic fibrosis, 24 per cent for Duchenne or Becker muscular dystrophy, and 7 per cent for haemophilias. Pregnancies at risk for known disorders with specific molecular lesions (e.g., sickle cell disease) were accurately diagnosed in direct and/or cultured villi. Diagnoses requiring analyses with closely linked polymorphic markers were occasionally uniformative or inconclusive. Maternal contamination was not reported in any biochemical or molecular-based diagnosis.

This patient, of northern European (non-Ashkenazi) ancestry, is the first affected child of this ethnic background available for molecular genetic analysis; thus, she represented an opportunity to identify a new mutation associated with this phenotype or, conversely, to further characterize the DN allele of the hexosaminidase alpha gene (G533-greater than A) as a more widely distributed mutation not previously observed in this gene pool. As a means of rapid analysis, we report a strategy for PCR amplification and direct DNA sequencing of exon 5 of the hexosaminidase alpha gene, the most frequent site of mutations in this condition. With this technique, the father of the affected child was determined to be heterozygous for the DN allele, while the mother was found to have only the normal sequence in this region. This observation further extends the known geographic and ethnic distribution of this mutation, and suggests the likelihood that the DN allele has been derived by multiple independent mutational events."

Perceptions of health in three groups were compared: those screened and found to carry the gene for Tay-Sachs disease, those screened and not found to carry the gene for Tay-Sachs disease, and a community based sample who, it was presumed, had not undergone screening. The groups did not differ in their perceptions of their current health or their past health. Carriers, however, viewed their future health with less optimism than the other two groups. The causes and consequences of this altered perception need to be explored in future studies. With the advent of population based screening for cystic fibrosis carrier status, these results highlight the importance of assessing in detail people's experiences of screening before the introduction of any mass genetic screening programmes."

In both Tay-Sachs brain and Gaucher spleen, saposins were found predominantly in light-density fractions while most of the GM2 ganglioside and glucocerebroside, respectively, were found in heavy-density fractions.

The recent characterization of 3 mutations in the HEXA gene (in exon 7, exon 11, and intron 12), which account for over 90% of HEXA mutations in Ashkenazim, appeared to offer better options for screening and diagnosis. The relative frequencies of the three mutations in Montreal are similar to those reported in four other North American populations. We compared enzyme and DNA analyses to determine specificity and sensitivity of each test when the other was used as the confirmatory procedure. Neither procedure has a sensitivity of 1.0. Maximum sensitivity and specificity were achieved by using both tests together.

Approximately 20% of the Ashkenazi carriers harbor a splice junction defect while about 78% bear a 4 base pair (bp) insertion. However, the Ashkenazi Jewish patient used in the original description of the 4 bp insertion carried this lesion in only 1 allele and was negative for the splice junction mutation. We cloned the insertion negative allele and by sequence analysis of the exons found a point mutation in exon 11 that results in substitution of Trp392 with a premature termination codon. Nine Ashkenazi Jewish carriers that tested negative for the major and minor mutations as well as for a lesion causing an adult form of Tay-Sachs disease did not carry the base change defect, suggesting that it may be a recent and/or rare mutation. This finding also indicates that screening the Ashkenazi population solely by recombinant DNA methods for the splice junction, 4 bp insertion, and adult mutations may result in occasional false negatives."

We have discovered that a Tay-Sachs mutation, IVS-9 + 1 G-->A, first detected by Akli et al. (Genomics 11:124-134, 1991), is a common disease allele in non-Jewish Caucasians (10/58 alleles examined). A PCR-based diagnostic test, which detects an NlaIII site generated by the mutation, revealed a frequency among enzyme-defined carriers of 9/64 (14%). Most of those carrying the allele trace their origins to the United Kingdom, Ireland, or Western Europe. It was not identified among 12 Black American TSD alleles or in any of 18 Ashkenazi Jewish, enzyme-defined carriers who did not carry any of the mutations common to this population. No normally spliced RNA was detected in PCR products generated from reverse transcription of RNA carrying the IVS-9 mutation. Instead, the low levels of mRNA from this allele were comprised of aberrant species resulting from the use of either of two cryptic donor sites, one truncating exon 9 and the other within IVS-9, spliced to exon 10. Numerous additional splice products were detected, most involving skipping of one or more surrounding exons. Together with a recently identified allele responsible for Hex A pseudodeficiency (Triggs-Raine et al. Am J Hum Genet, 1992), these two alleles accounted for almost 50% (29/64) of TSD or carrier alleles ascertained by enzyme screening tests in non-Jewish Caucasians."

Clinical and biochemical evidence suggested that the increased carrier frequency was due to at least two altered alleles for the hexosaminidase A alpha-subunit. We now report two mutant alleles in this Pennsylvania Dutch kindred, and one polymorphism. One allele, reported originally in a French TSD patient (Akli et al., 1991), is a GT-->AT transition at the donor splice-site of intron 9.

Novel mutations were found in two of these families. The third is a previously reported mutation (G-->A transition at nt 1444) (Nakano et al., 1988). Direct sequencing of PCR products identified a novel insertion of an A after nt 547 in family 1. This change generates an early termination codon 6 bp downstream from the insertion site. Allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization confirmed homozygosity in the proband. Single strand conformational polymorphism analysis and direct sequencing of amplified exon 13 revealed a T-->C transition at nt 1453 with the corresponding amino acid substitution W485R in the second family. This mutation creates an Fnu4HI restriction site. The proband is homozygous for this allele. When the site-specific mutagenized alpha cDNA carrying the T-->C transition at nt 1453 was expressed in COS 1 cells hexosaminidase S activity was not detectable above background. A G-->A transition at nt 1444 (exon 13) corresponding to the E482K substitution was found in the third family. This mutation occurs at a CpG dinucleotide. It has been reported in an Italian TSD proband and causes defective intracellular transport of the alpha-subunit from the rough endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus."

An mRNA-containing extract of cultured fibroblasts obtained from one of the probands was used as a template to amplify the coding sequence of the hexosaminidase A (Hex A) alpha-subunit. Sequencing of amplified cDNA fragments revealed a single alteration, guanine to adenine at nt 749 creating a G250D mutation. The mutation introduces a new recognition site for the restriction enzyme Eco RV, permitting identification of heterozygotes for this allele following PCR amplification and Eco RV digestion of exon 7 sequences from genomic DNA templates. In order to test the effect of this substitution, an in vitro mutagenized cDNA construct was introduced into a mammalian expression vector and transfected into monkey Cos-1 cells separately or along with a beta-cDNA expression vector. When the mutant alpha-cDNA was the only gene introduced into COS cells no enzymatic activity above endogenous COS cell activity was detected. Cotransfection of normal alpha-cDNA and beta-cDNA followed by immunoprecipitation of human Hex A resulted in 20-fold increase in the ratio between positive and negative (mock transfection) control values. This allowed the detection of some residual activity (12% of the positive control) when the mutant alpha-cDNA replaced its wild-type counterpart. The predicted protein environment in which the mutation occurs is compared to that of the adult-onset Tay-Sachs disease mutation caused by a Gly269-->Ser substitution in exon 7.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

It is, however, not necessary to rely on any particular metaphysical views to refute Ramsey's position. For Ramsey's view to be internally consistent, Ramsey would have to be able to distinguish between dying and non-dying patients.

Questions of identity aside, how can it be that altering the genome of children suffering from Lesch-Nyhan syndrome or Tay-Sachs disease so that they now produce the enzyme that they formerly lacked does not benefit them? Clearly, if their identities were not changed, such individuals would in fact realize great benefit from PGI, since the devastating bad effects of the genetic flaw would be avoided.

The fragment amplified from one patient was also subcloned and sequenced. Ten patients, constituting a clinically and biochemically homogeneous group, were found to be homozygous for the DN allele. The other, whose clinical profile more resembled the late-infantile phenotype often described in the literature, was a compound heterozygote carrying the DN allele and another, as yet unidentified, abnormal allele.

In two patients, abnormal size cDNA-PCR fragments in which exons were removed resulted from splicing mutations that were characterized at the genomic DNA level: both were G to A transitions, at the first position of intron 2 and at the fifth position of intron 4. Five other mutations have been identified by cDNA-PCR chemical mismatch analysis and direct sequencing of an amplified fragment containing the mismatch site. One missense mutation alters the codon for Ser210 to Phe in exon 6 and the other one alters the codon for Arg504 to Cys in exon 13. A 3-bp deletion results in the deletion of a phenylalanine residue in exon 8. Two nonsense mutations in exon 3 (Arg137 to stop) and in exon 11 (Arg393 to stop) are associated with a marked decrease of mRNA abundance, probably because they result in mRNA instability. Three of the six single base mutations involve the conversion of a CpG dinucleotide in the sense strand to TpG. These results demonstrate the extreme molecular heterogeneity of mutations causing Tay-Sachs disease. The procedure described in this paper allows the rapid detection of any type of mutation, except those impairing the promoter function. Applicable even to patients with splicing or nonsense mutations and very low mRNA abundance, it has therefore a potentially broad application in human genetics, for both diagnostic and fundamental purposes."

In all pregnancies one should determine in systematic fashion whether family history places a pregnant woman at increased risk over the background risk of 2-3% congenital anomalies. All women over age 35 years at delivery should be offered prenatal cytogenetic testing, and women of all ages should be offered maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein screening for neural tube defects.

Cystic fibrosis screening (delta F508 mutations) is not currently recommended for the general populations, but should be offered to relatives of an individual having delta F508 cystic fibrosis. Irrespective of the extent of screening programmes for Mendelian traits, the mutant allele will remain in the general population because by far the greatest genetic load lies in clinically normal heterozygotes, affected contributing far less to the load despite the obvious clinical effect."

In a previous report, we analyzed the biochemical consequences of an Arg178----His substitution in the alpha-subunit, causing the B1 phenotype, by in vitro mutagenesis of the homologous codon for Arg211 in the beta-subunit to produce His. We found that the substitution did not affect dimer formation or cellular targeting but caused a near total loss of activity toward a common alpha- and/or beta-substrate. Additional effects were also noted that suggested a perturbation had occurred to the protein's secondary structure. In this report, we investigate further the role of Arg in the catalysis of hexosaminidase substrates. The introduction of more or less conservative amino acid substitutions at the beta-Arg211 site were evaluated in terms of their effects on the protein's catalytic activity and susceptibility to the arginine-specific reagents and on its stability and rate of maturation in the cell's lysosome. These data demonstrate that the changes in the in vivo stability and rate of maturation, previously noted with the Arg211----His substitution, are independent of the loss in enzymatic activity. Whereas treatment of purified normal human placental hexosaminidases A and B with arginine-specific modifying reagents produced a time-dependent loss of enzymatic activity toward both alpha-specific and common substrates, these reagents failed to significantly decrease the residual activities of mutant proteins lacking Arg at position 211. Kinetic analysis of the residual enzyme activity from our most conservative construct, Arg211----Lys, determined an apparent Vmax approximately 400-fold reduced from that of the wild type enzyme but detected no change in the apparent Km. Additionally, the pH optimum of this mutant enzyme was narrower and slightly more basic than that of the normal enzyme. Thus, Arg211 in the beta-subunit and, by extrapolation, the Arg178 in the alpha-subunit of beta-hexosaminidase are \"active\" residues, i.e. part of the catalytic sites, but do not participate in substrate binding."

    "title": "Expression of the beta-hexosaminidase alpha subunit gene with the four-base insertion of infantile Jewish Tay-Sachs disease.",
    "abstract": "One of the two mutations responsible for the classical infantile Jewish form of Tay-Sachs disease is a four-base insertion in exon 11 of the beta-hexosaminidase alpha subunit gene. The gene is known to be transcribed normally, but the mRNA is essentially undetectable. It is not clear why such a relatively minor abnormality results in complete failure to generate stable mRNA. The four-base insertion was introduced into the normal beta-hexosaminidase cDNA by site-directed mutagenesis. When COS-1 cells were transfected with the resultant mutant cDNA, it generated stable mRNA and a truncated, relatively stable but catalytically inactive enzyme protein. The mutant enzyme protein was not processed nor released into the culture medium. The mutant cDNA also generated the truncated enzyme protein in an in vitro translation system with rabbit reticulocyte lysate. COS-1 cells transfected with a 3' end of the gene segment, from intron 8 through the 3' terminus, generated processed RNA of approximately 2 kilobases, the size expected from normal splicing, irrespective of presence or absence of the four-base insertion in exon 11. These results indicate that the four-base insertion does not destabilize properly spliced mRNA, nor does it interfere with normal splicing of the transcript, at least in the expression system utilized. If the four-base insertion is responsible for the undetectable mRNA in the mutant cells, it must interfere with some other steps in the processing/splicing/transport of the primary transcript yet to be examined. On the other hand, the possibility cannot be excluded definitively that another still unidentified abnormality in the same allele might be responsible for the nearly complete absence of mRNA."

    "abstract": "Tay-Sachs disease is one of the few neurodegenerative diseases of known causes. It results from mutations of the HEXA gene encoding the alpha subunit of beta-hexosaminidase, producing a destructive ganglioside accumulation in lysosomes, principally in neurons. With the determination of the protein sequence of the alpha and beta subunits, deduced from cDNA sequences, the complex pathway of subcellular and lysosomal processing of the enzyme has been determined. More recently, detailed knowledge of the gene structure has allowed the determination of specific mutations causing Tay-Sachs disease. The high incidence of the disease in Ashkenazi Jews is attributed predominantly to three mutations present in high frequency, while in non-Jews some two dozen mutations have been identified thus far. The cataloguing of mutations has important implications for carrier screening and prenatal diagnosis for Tay-Sachs disease."

The 95% confidence limits for the prevalence are 1:4 352-1:16389. This is the highest prevalence described for any glycoproteinosis in any population and comparable to the incidence figures of the most common lysosomal storage diseases, Gaucher disease type I and Tay-Sachs disease among Ashkenazi Jews.

A G----T transversion was observed in the AG acceptor splice site preceding exon 5 of the beta-hexosaminidase alpha-subunit gene in the first black family. This transversion changed the acceptor splice site from the consensus sequence, AG, to AT, thereby interfering with splicing at this intron 4/exon 5 junction. The proband was homozygous for this mutation; his mother and a brother are heterozygous. The same mutation was found in a second, apparently unrelated, black GM2-gangliosidosis patient. The second patient was a compound heterozygote, as only one allele carried this mutation. The mother and a brother in this second family are carriers for this mutation, while the father and a noncarrier sister are normal for this region of the gene. The third proband did not have this mutation; nor did the mother of a fourth black proband. Eight other independently ascertained non-black, non-Jewish, GM2-gangliosidosis families did not have this mutation. The observation of the same novel mutation in two unrelated black GM2-gangliosidosis patients indicates that the American black population has segregating within it at least one GM2-gangliosidosis mutation which may be specific to this population and not a result of migration."

This prompted a search for a C----T transition in the same dinucleotide, as would be expected from the mechanism of CpG mutagenesis. Such a mutation, which results in a substitution of cysteine for arginine, was found in a patient with chronic GM2 gangliosidosis, in compound heterozygosity with the known 269Gly----Ser allele. The biochemical phenotype of the 504Arg----Cys mutation was examined by site-directed mutagenesis of the alpha-subunit cDNA and transfection of Cos-1 cells. The expression of the mutagenized cDNA with the cysteine substitution gave rise to an alpha-subunit with the same defects as those resulting from expression of mutagenized cDNA with the histidine substitution--i.e., secretion primarily as the alpha-monomer rather than as the alpha alpha dimer, along with absence of enzymatic activity. The 504Arg----Cys/269Gly----Ser genotype of the chronic GM2 gangliosidosis patient is shared by her sibling, who has mild adult-onset GM2 gangliosidosis, implying that the clinical differences between them must be attributed to other factors. The family is unique in yet another respect--namely, that the normal allele of the mother and of a 504Arg----Cys heterozygous sibling has a silent mutation, a G----A transition in the wobble position of the glutamic acid codon at position 506.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

To facilitate the implementation of such studies a simple method for isolating DNA from the remaining leukocyte sonicate, and using this DNA for polymerase chain reaction amplification of regions involved in three lysosomal disorders is described. The DNA from the sonicate was isolated without proteinase K digestion, was readily soluble in Tris-EDTA buffer and available for amplification almost immediately. The usefulness of the methods was confirmed by studies on patients and family members with three relatively common lysosomal disorders, metachromatic leukodystrophy.

Over 90% of North American Ashkenazi carriers tested have been shown to have either a splice site mutation at the boundary of exon 12 and intron 12 in the beta-hexosaminidase alpha subunit gene, or a 4 base pair insertion in exon 11. We describe simple assays involving amplification of DNA across these two mutation sites by polymerase chain reaction and the results of screening 75 subjects are given. The frequencies of the splice and insert mutations in 41 UK Ashkenazi carriers (20% to 80%, respectively) were similar to those found in the North American community. Twelve Ashkenazi subjects classified as non-carriers on enzyme assay were found to be negative for both mutations tested. All Ashkenazi carriers tested (both obligate carriers and those picked up by population screening) had either the splice or insert mutations; in contrast to this, only 21% of the non-Ashkenazi carriers had one or other of these mutations. It is concluded that within the carrier screening programmes for the Ashkenazi community, assays for the splice and insert mutations, together with an assay recently described for a mutation causing the rarer adult onset form of the disease, will prove useful as confirmatory tests for subjects who give positive or borderline results when screened on enzyme assay."

We have found that the mutations underlying Tay-Sachs disease in Ashkenazi and Moroccan Jews are different. Analysis of a Moroccan Jewish Tay-Sachs patient had revealed an in-frame deletion (delta F) of one of the two adjacent phenylalanine codons that are present at positions 304 and 305 in the alpha-subunit sequence. The mutation impairs the subunit assembly of beta-hexosaminidase A, resulting in an absence of enzyme activity. The Moroccan patient was found also to carry, in the other alpha-subunit allele, a different, and as yet unidentified, mutation which causes a deficit of mRNA. Analysis of obligate carriers from six unrelated Moroccan Jewish families showed that three harbor the delta F mutation, raising the possibility that this defect may be a prevalent mutation in this ethnic group."

    "abstract": "Ganglioside GD1a-GalNAc was isolated from Tay-Sachs brain, tritium-labeled in its sphingosine moiety, and its enzymic degradation studied in vitro and in cultured fibroblasts. When offered as micelles, GD1a-GalNAc was almost not hydrolyzed by Hex A or Hex B, while after incorporation of the ganglioside into the outer leaflet of liposomes, the terminal GalNAc residue was rapidly split off by Hex a. In striking contrast to ganglioside GM2, the major glycolipid substrate of Hex A, the enzymic hydrolysis of GD1a-GalNAc was not promoted by the GM2 activator protein, although the activator protein did bind GD1a-GalNAc to form a water-soluble complex. Pathobiochemical studies corroborate these results. After incorporation of [3H]GD1a-GalNAc into cultured skin fibroblasts from healthy subjects and from patients with different variants of GM2 gangliosidosis, its degradation was found to be strongly attenuated in mutant cells with Hex A deficiencies such as variant B (Tay-Sachs disease), variant B1 and variant 0 (Sandhoff disease), while in cells with variant AB (GM2 activator deficiency), its catabolism was blocked only at the level of GM2. In line with these metabolic studies, a normal content of GD1a-GalNAc was found in brains of patients who had succumbed to variant AB of GM2 gangliosidosis whereas in brains from variants B, B1, and 0, its concentration was considerably elevated (up to 19-fold). Together with studies on the enzymic degradation of GM2 derivatives with modifications in the ceramide portion, these results indicate that mainly steric hindrance by adjacent lipid molecules impedes the access of Hex A to membrane-bound GM2 (whose degradation therefore depends on solubilization by the GM2 activator) and in addition that the interaction between the GM2. GM2 activator complex and the enzyme must be highly specific."

In the past 5 years it has become possible to dissect out the phenotypic complexity on the basis of abnormalities on the DNA level. Available data on the 18 disease-causing mutations so far identified in the beta-hexosaminidase alpha-gene allow an oversimplified generalization; mutations that produce no or highly unstable mRNA cause the most severe infantile forms of the disease, while all late-onset forms are due to point mutations within the protein-coding region, which generate stable mRNA and stable mutant protein. The mutation underlying the distinct phenotype of Jewish adult Tay-Sachs disease will be discussed separately by Navon. The prototype of juvenile Tay-Sachs disease is the B1 variant. The disease was first recognized by an apparent discrepancy in the beta-hexosaminidase activities toward the conventional artificial substrates and the natural lipid substrate, GM2-ganglioside. When assayed with the conventional artificial substrates, patients appear reasonably normal while they are severely deficient in hydrolysis of the natural substrate (and more recently the 'sulfated' artificial substrate). The majority of B1 patients fall in the clinical category of juvenile GM2-gangliosidosis. Some of the earlier juvenile patients reported to have partial hexosaminidase A deficiency are likely to be B1 variant. Two point mutations, occurring at a mutation hot spot, CpG, and both affecting the same codon, have been described as the causes of the B1 variant phenotype; G533----A, Arg178----His; and C532----T, Arg178----Cys.

Mutation analysis included polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the relevant regions of genomic DNA, followed by allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization; another test for heterozygosity of the exon 11 insertion was based on the formation of heteroduplex PCR fragments of low electrophoretic mobility. The percentage distribution of the exon 11, intron 12, exon 7, and unidentified mutant alleles was 73:15:4:8 among 156 Jewish carriers of Hex A deficiency and 16:0:3:81 among 51 non-Jewish carriers. Regardless of the mutation, the ancestral origin of the Jewish carriers was primarily eastern and (somewhat less often) central Europe, whereas for the non-Jewish carriers it was western Europe. Because a twelfth of the Jewish carriers and four-fifths of the non-Jewish carriers of Hex A deficiency had mutant alleles other than the three common ones tested, enzyme-based tests cannot be replaced by DNA-based tests at the present time. However, DNA-based tests for two-carrier couples could identify those at risk for the chronic/adult GM2 gangliosidoses rather than for infantile Tay-Sachs disease."

    "title": "The molecular basis of Tay-Sachs disease: mutation identification and diagnosis.",
    "abstract": "Tay-Sachs disease is the prototype of lysosomal storage disease. While it was first described over a century ago, the defective enzyme was not identified until 1969, making possible the development of enzyme-based diagnostic and carrier screening techniques. This led to the establishment of the successful international Tay-Sachs screening program, primarily for the high risk Ashkenazi Jewish population. In the past five years the development of recombinant DNA technology has allowed researchers to characterize 95-99% of the mutations causing Tay-Sachs disease in this high risk ethnic group. Knowledge of the exact mutations responsible for the disease coupled with the powerful polymerase chain reaction technique has now made DNA-based screening and diagnosis possible. While the enzyme-based test has proven to be reliable and economical, it cannot differentiate variant phenotypes and requires the presence of specialized testing centers. Although the DNA-based test is presently less economical, it can provide carrier couples with their exact genotype and thus, predict the general phenotype of an unborn child. Furthermore, as the catalogue of mutations leading to human disease increases, more economical DNA methodologies will be developed. In the future it would be expected that a laboratory using a single DNA-based technology could diagnose and screen for a myriad of human diseases including Tay-Sachs disease."

    "abstract": "This report discusses the role of prenatal screening in preventing congenital abnormalities or, when prevention is not possible, in avoiding the conception or the birth of those who would have untreatable abnormalities. Women who are found by screening not to be immune to rubella can be safely vaccinated prior to pregnancy; those found to be at risk of having children with genetic disorders such as Tay-Sachs disease or thalassemia have the option of avoiding the conception of affected offspring. Screening during pregnancy permits the primary prevention of Rh disease and its sequelae when it results in the prophylactic administration of Rh-immune globulin to unsensitized Rh-negative women. Maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein screening identifies pregnant women who are at increased risk of carrying fetuses with neural tube defects or Down's syndrome, giving them the option of avoiding the birth of affected fetuses through abortion. Recombinant DNA technology will permit screening for many more genetic disorders as the disease-related genes and mutations are identified. For many of these disorders, the ability to predict the risk of disease will antedate preventive and therapeutic interventions by many years. During this lag phase, issues concerning the validity of the tests, the severity of the conditions for which screening is offered, the safety of the interventions, and the autonomy of the pregnant women in deciding to be screened are important."

    "abstract": "The abnormality in the gene coding for the beta-hexosaminidase alpha subunit was analyzed in a non-Jewish patient with clinically typical infantile Tay-Sachs disease. The family was Catholic, and the father and the mother were of Irish and German descent, respectively. A hitherto undescribed single nucleotide transversion was found within exon 11 (G1260----C; Trp420----Cys). The coding sequence was otherwise entirely normal. Expression in the COS I cell system confirmed that the mutant gene does not produce functional enzyme protein. The mutation can be identified rapidly and reliably because it abolishes one of the two KpnI sites in the coding sequence. The patient was a compound heterozygote with one allele carrying this mutation. The nature of the abnormality in the other allele remains unidentified. Examination of genomic DNA from the parents demonstrated that this \"Kpn mutation\" was inherited from the maternal side of the family."

Abnormal ultrastructural features were present as early as 10 weeks gestation. Myelin bodies were found in all placental cell types in a case of Niemann-Pick disorder and stromal cells showed marked vacuolation in Hurler's disease. Membranous arrays were occasionally identified in the lysosomes of stromal cells in a case of Sandhoff's disease, together with some myelin body formation in the trophoblast and endothelium. In Pompe's disease, intralysosomal accumulations of glycogen were present in all cell types except syncytiotrophoblast, while in sialic acid storage disorder all placental cells were affected except for the cytotrophoblast. Collagen fibre disorientation and excess associated proteoglycan was seen in a formalin-fixed placenta with Sanfilippo mucopolysaccharidosis, and syncytial vacuolation, caused possibly by delays in fixation, was evident in many specimens. The specimens were collected from different centres and the fixation procedure varied significantly. The most satisfactory results were obtained from chorionic villus sampling in vivo and from pregnancies terminated using aspiration followed by immediate fixation. The importance of liaison with clinicians is stressed in order to obtain optimal preservation of the tissue. This is particularly vital in immature specimens of placenta where abnormal storage product material may not have had time to accumulate."

    "abstract": "The prevention of Tay-Sachs disease (GM2 gangliosidosis, type 1) depends on the identification of carriers of the gene for this autosomal recessive disorder. We compared the enzyme-based test widely used in screening for Tay-Sachs disease with a test based on analysis of DNA. We developed methods to detect the three mutations in the HEXA gene that occur with high frequency among Ashkenazi Jews: two mutations cause infantile Tay-Sachs disease, and the third causes the adult-onset form of the disease. DNA segments containing these mutation sites were amplified with the polymerase chain reaction and analyzed for the presence of the mutations. Among 62 Ashkenazi obligate carriers of Tay-Sachs disease, the three specific mutations accounted for all but one of the mutant alleles (98 percent). In 216 Ashkenazi carriers identified by the enzyme test, DNA analysis showed that 177 (82 percent) had one of the identified mutations. Of the 177, 79 percent had the exon 11 insertion mutation, 18 percent had the intron 12 splice-junction mutation, and 3 percent had the less severe exon 7 mutation associated with adult-onset disease. The results of the enzyme tests in the 39 subjects (18 percent) who were defined as carriers but in whom DNA analysis did not identify a mutant allele were probably false positive (although there remains some possibility of unidentified mutations). In addition, of 152 persons defined as noncarriers by the enzyme-based test, 1 was identified as a carrier by DNA analysis (i.e., a false negative enzyme-test result). The increased specificity and predictive value of the DNA-based test make it a useful adjunct to the diagnostic tests currently used to screen for carriers of Tay-Sachs disease. Although some false positive results may be desirable on an enzyme-based test that is used in screening, the DNA test allows precise definition of the carrier state for the known mutations."

    "abstract": "Juvenile GM2 gangliosidosis is a rare neurodegenerative disorder closely related to Tay-Sachs disease but of later onset and more protracted course. The biochemical defect lies in the alpha-subunit of the lysosomal enzyme beta-hexosaminidase. Cultured fibroblasts derived from patient A synthesized an alpha-subunit which could acquire mannose 6-phosphate and be secreted, but which failed to associate with the beta-subunit to form the enzymatically active heterodimer. By contrast, fibroblasts from patient B synthesized an alpha-subunit that was retained in the endoplasmic reticulum. To identify the molecular basis of the disorder, RNA from fibroblasts of these two patients was reverse-transcribed, and the cDNA encoding the alpha-subunit of beta-hexosaminidase was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in four overlapping fragments. The PCR fragments were subcloned and shown by sequence analysis to contain a G to A transition corresponding to substitution of histidine for arginine at position 504 in the case of patient A and at position 499 in the case of patient B. The mutations were confirmed by hybridization of allele-specific oligonucleotides to PCR-amplified fragments of DNA corresponding to exon 13 of the alpha-subunit gene. The Arg504----His mutation was found on both alleles of patient A as well as of another unrelated patient; the homozygosity of this mutant allele is attributable to consanguinity in the two families. The Arg499----His mutation was found in patient B in compound heterozygosity with a common infantile Tay-Sachs allele. There is additional heterogeneity in juvenile GM2 gangliosidosis, as neither mutation was found in the DNA of a fourth patient. The Arg----His mutations at positions 499 and 504 are located at CpG dinucleotides, which are known to be mutagenic \"hot spots.\""

    "title": "Social mechanisms in the population genetics of Tay-Sachs and other lethal autosomal recessive diseases: a computer simulation model.",
    "abstract": "A computer simulation model was developed to study the effects of various feudal social customs on the incidence of lethal autosomal recessive genes. Populations of 500 individuals were created in which each person was characterized by sibship, genotype, and sex. The numbered sibships were sorted into numerical order. Each individual then sought a mate from 6 or 12 sibships on either side of his or her own sibship. The resulting couples were sorted in order of the husband's sibship number, after which the couples produced children in accordance with the prevailing birth rate. This ordering of sibships made the probability of a gene remaining in one locality higher than the probability of it drifting to distant localities. A lethal autosomal recessive gene was introduced into populations at a starting carrier rate of 10%. This fell after 20 generations to 2.54 +/- 0.17% (SEM) which was significantly less than the 5.00% carrier rate predicted by a deterministic model in which random mating occurred in an infinite population. The excessive loss of the lethal gene was caused by the high incidence of consanguineous marriages and by the occurrence of random inequalities in the distribution of the gene. The avoidance of sib marriages raised the final carrier frequency (3.28 +/- 0.19%) as did reproductive compensation (4.33 +/- 0.26%). The combination of the incest taboo and reproductive compensation raised the final carrier rate to 5.05 +/- 0.28%. It is concluded that the social factors which may have operated over a period of many centuries in the past have had a significant effect on the population genetics of lethal autosomal recessive genes."

    "abstract": "Tay-Sachs disease is an autosomal recessive genetic disease caused by a deficiency in beta-hexosaminidase A. We have characterized a new mutation in a Tunisian patient displaying a late infantile form of Tay-Sachs disease. Northern blot analysis of patient's fibroblast total RNAs shows a broad, fast migrating band in the region of the normal beta-hexosaminidase alpha transcripts. The mRNA coding for beta-hexosaminidase alpha subunit was first reverse transcribed and then amplified in four overlapping segments spanning the entire coding sequence by polymerase chain reaction. We found in the products of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) that amplify the segment spanning exons 2-7, in addition to a normal fragment, two smaller size fragments, one of which is also seen in normal control fibroblasts. The analysis of the patient's specific abnormal fragment by hybridization with exon-specific oligonucleotides and then sequencing allowed us to conclude that this fragment lacked exon 5. The other smaller species lacked exons 4 and 5 in both patient and normal control. The sequence of a genomic fragment containing exon 5 and of the patient's normal cDNA fragment spanning exons 2-7, revealed a point mutation G to A at the last nucleotide of exon 5. This mutation doesn't change the sense of the affected codon. Northern blot of patient's fibroblast poly(A+) RNAs allowed us to quantify two of the forms of transcripts seen by PCR. In the patient, the normal size transcript and the exon 5-deleted transcript represent, respectively, 3 and 7% of the normal control beta-hexosaminidase alpha mRNA. We propose that this point mutation is responsible for an inefficient and abnormal processing of the mutant transcript resulting in the appearance of two low abundance spliced mRNAs. One is lacking exon 5 and most likely codes for an inactive protein; the other is similar to normal beta-hexosaminidase alpha mRNA, except for the presence of the silent G to A mutation and codes therefore for a normal enzyme accounting for the 2.5% residual beta-hexosaminidase A activity measured in patient's fibroblasts by a fluorometric assay. The third form, without exons 4 and 5, is also evidenced in normal fibroblasts by PCR so that we think that it is not related to Tay-Sachs disease."

Expression of the mutant enzyme protein in the COS I cell system indicated that it is catalytically inactive and also is unstable. The patient is a compound heterozygote, and the exact abnormality in the other allele could not be identified except that it is not any of the other nine known mutations of the beta-hexosaminidase alpha. The data collectively suggest that the other allele is not producing stable messenger RNA (mRNA). The rapidly increasing number of mutations responsible for clinical and enzymological phenotypes and the very large number of statistically possible combinations among them for compound heterozygosity pose a serious pragmatic problem for classification and nomenclature of this group of rare genetic disorders."

A quantitative HPLC method was used for saposin A, C, and D and a stimulation assay was used for saposin B. In normal tissues, saposin D was the most abundant of the four saposins. Massive accumulations of saposins, especially saposin A (about 80-fold increase over normal), were found in brain of patients with Tay-Sachs disease or infantile Sandhoff disease. In spleen of adult patients with Gaucher disease, saposin A and D accumulations (60- and 17-fold, respectively, over normal) were higher than that of saposin C (about 16-fold over normal). Similar massive accumulations of saposins A and D were found in liver of patients with fucosidosis (about 70- and 20-fold, respectively, over normal). Saposin D was the primary saposin stored in the liver of a patient with Niemann-Pick disease (about 30-fold over normal). Moderate increases of saposins B and D were found in a patient with GM1 gangliosidosis. Normal or near normal levels of all saposins were found in patients with Krabbe disease, metachromatic leukodystrophy, Fabry disease, adrenoleukodystrophy, I-cell disease, mucopolysaccharidosis types 2 and 3B, or Jansky-Bielschowsky disease.

A total of seven patients with enzymological characteristics of B1 variant have since been studied. They were Puerto Rican (DN), Italian, French, Spanish, two patients of mixed ethnic origin (English/Italian/Hungarian and English/French/Azores), and a Czechoslovakian. In confirmation of our earlier finding based on screening with allele-specific probes, all patients except the one from Czechoslovakia carried the same DN-allele. A new point mutation found in this patient changed the same codon affected in the DN-allele (C532----T; Arg178----Cys). An asymptomatic Japanese individual included as a control also carried one allele with the DN-mutation. Site-directed mutagenesis and expression studies in COS I cells demonstrated that either of the two point mutations abolishes the catalytic activity of the alpha subunit. The Spanish patient was homozygous for the DN-allele, but others were all compound heterozygotes. The Puerto Rican patient was a compound heterozygote with the DN-mutation in one allele and with the four-base insertion in exon 11, one of the two mutations found in the classical Ashkenazi Jewish Tay-Sachs disease, in the other allele. Abnormalities of the other allele were not identified in all other compound heterozygous patients. In these patients, the level of mRNA derived from the other allele was variable, ranging from being undetectable to being much lower than normal. This series of studies uncovered a new B1 variant mutation, confirmed our preliminary finding that the DN-allele has a surprisingly wide geographic and ethnic distribution, and pointed out the highly complex nature of the molecular genetics of this rare disorder. They also support our working hypothesis that mutations responsible for the unique enzymological characteristics of the B1 variant should be located in or near exon 5 of the gene and that this region of the enzyme protein is critical for its catalytic function."

The commonly used screening test for detection of Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) carriers is the serum Hex heat inactivation method (HIM), which is based on the assumption that Hex A is the only thermolabile component of Hex; However, in the presence of thermolabile Hex B, HIM could lead to false-negative results. Since TSD is very rare among Mideastern Jews while thermolabile Hex B is very rare among Ashkenazi and Moroccan Jews, it is concluded that at present there is almost no risk of such false-negative results. In order to further reduce this risk it is recommended that screening of people of Mideastern or mixed ancestry be done with HIM in leukocytes rather than in serum or with the specific substrate for Hex A in serum."

If these services are to be delivered fairly to populations, there must be much more emphasis on community information, professional education, and service monitoring."

    "abstract": "Optical light and electron microscopy were used in studies into two cases of infantile GM2-gangliosidosis. The results are reported in this paper. The correlation has been evident between histological and ultrastructural findings. Reliable delimitation between two different variants of infantile GM2-gangliosidosis was achieved through biochemical investigation of postmortally cultured skin fibroblasts. A classical form with isolated hexosaminidase-A defect (Tay-Sachs disease) was distinguished from a second variant with complete defect of both isoenzymes of hexosaminidase (Sandhoff's disease). Biochemical investigation of postmortally cultured fibroblasts today has become indispensable to enlargement of autopsy findings from other storage diseases, as well."

    "abstract": "In 13 patients, the GM2 gangliosidoses, Sandhoff disease and Tay-Sachs disease, were found to be constantly associated with homogeneously and symmetrically increased CT attenuation within the thalami. In the only patient examined with MR imaging, a T2-weighted sequence showed hypointense thalami. It is suggested that this finding is caused by an accumulation of calcium, associated with the intracellular storage of GM2 ganglioside. The finding of dense thalami may be useful as a specific diagnostic criterion for GM2 gangliosidoses. In a few patients with blocks in adjacent steps in the sphingolipid metabolism, this finding was not present."

    "title": "Introduction of the alpha subunit mutation associated with the B1 variant of Tay-Sachs disease into the beta subunit produces a beta-hexosaminidase B without catalytic activity.",
    "abstract": "Lysosomal beta-hexosaminidase (beta-N-acetylhexosaminidase, EC 3.2.1.52) occurs in two major isozyme forms, hexosaminidase A (alpha beta) and hexosaminidase B (beta beta). Although dimer formation is required for enzymatic activity, both subunits contain active sites which share many common substrates. However, the alpha subunit alone confers on hexosaminidase A the specificity for negatively charged substrates, e.g. GM2 ganglioside. Recently, a point mutation, producing a single amino acid substitution in the alpha subunit (Arg178-His), has been found to be associated with the B1 variant phenotype of Tay-Sachs disease (Ohno, K., and Suzuki, K. (1988) J. Neurochem. 50, 316-318). This variant is characterized by normal levels of hexosaminidase A as measured by a common artificial substrate, but an absence of activity toward alpha subunit-specific substrates. However, because of the presence of an active beta subunit in the mutant hexosaminidase A, it has not been possible to determine whether the affected alpha subunit has undergone a change in substrate specificity or become totally inactive. In order to define the full effect of the B1 mutation we have taken advantage of the common evolutionary origin of the genes coding for the alpha and beta subunits. Since the B1 mutation occurs in a region of extended identity between the two subunits, we have duplicated the Arg178-His mutation in a cDNA coding for the human beta subunit (Arg211-His). By expression of the mutant construct in monkey COS cells we have been able to examine the effect of this mutation on beta subunits which are capable of forming stable, active homodimers, an experiment that could not readily be accomplished with heterodimeric hexosaminidase A. Our data show that beta homodimers containing the Arg211-His substitution are formed and are transported into the lysosome in a manner identical to that of normal pro-hexosaminidase B. However, the mutant homodimers are processed at a slower rate and are less stable in the lysozyme. Their most striking feature was a total lack of normal hexosaminidase B activity. We conclude that while the effect of the Arg178-His substitution is not strictly limited to the active site, the severe B1 phenotype results from a totally inactive alpha-subunit in hexosaminidase A."

    "abstract": "Mutations of the gene encoding the alpha-subunit of the lysosomal enzyme, beta-hexosaminidase, are the cause of Tay-Sachs disease. We previously showed that fibroblasts from one patient (WG1051) synthesized an unstable alpha-subunit that was smaller than normal and appeared to be trapped in an early biosynthetic compartment (Zokaeem, G., Bayleran, J., Kaplan, P., Hechtman, P., and Neufeld, E. F. (1987) Am. J. Hum. Genet. 40, 537-547). We now have identified the mutation as a deletion of cytosine at position 1510 of the coding sequence. We first determined that the structural abnormality was at the carboxyl terminus of the protein and then sequenced the corresponding regions of the cDNA and genomic DNA after amplification by the polymerase chain reaction. The frameshift mutation, which is present on both alleles, causes premature termination four codons downstream, and the loss of a very hydrophilic stretch of 22 amino acids. Expression of alpha-subunit cDNA with the cytosine deletion in Cos-1 cells reproduced the WG1051 phenotype, i.e. a truncated alpha-subunit that was retained and degraded in an early compartment, presumably the endoplasmic reticulum. Loss of the cysteine residue at position 522 was not the sole cause of instability and defective transport."

The results indicated that a trend has developed for individuals at risk to delay testing until pregnancy when carrier detection is technically more difficult and the time available for retesting and organizing prenatal diagnosis is limited. If the trend continues, the full potential of chorionic villus sampling (CVS) for the prenatal diagnosis of the disease will be difficult to realize."

    "abstract": "Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are more common among Jews than among non-Jews. Despite the existence of studies on the prevalence and incidence of inflammatory bowel disease in relation to the continent of residence or origin, there are no studies on the specific countries of origin of Ashkenazi Jewish patients. We report here the first analysis of 233 U.S. Jewish patients by defined world regions and subregions. Using two different sets of controls (a self-referred Jewish population for Tay-Sachs disease carrier detection and a sample of Jewish persons ascertained through unrelated studies from the same hospital as our patients), we found a significant excess of patients of middle European origin relative to those of Polish or Russian origin. These observations suggest that the inflammatory bowel disease gene(s) are more prevalent in the Jewish population that originated in middle Europe than in those from Poland and Russia. These results further suggest that Jewish patients with inflammatory bowel disease probably represent a nonrandom genetically predisposed subset of the Jewish population. This provides further evidence for the genetic contribution to inflammatory bowel disease in general, and to its higher risk in the Jewish population."

    "abstract": "We studied isozymes of urinary beta-D-N-acetylglucosaminidase (NAG), NAG-A and NAG-B, to develop a method for the determination of them. Urinary NAG-A was demonstrated to be measured most appropriately by the thermal inactivation at 50 degrees C for 4 hours in the buffer solution of pH 4.8. Using this method, 13 subjects were simultaneously measured for the levels of both urinary and serum NAG-A, which revealed no significant relation between them (r = 0.03). A significant increase in the mean value of urinary NAG-A activities (U/ml) was found in the 11-12 year-old subjects compared with those in the 6-7 year-old subjects. Although no significant differences were revealed among the total urinary NAG activities of the subjects, the values of NAG-A/total NAG (percent) tended to increase as the ages of the subjects increasing. In conclusion, when determining urinary NAG levels, a careful consideration must be taken into account for the presence of heterozygous carriers for Tay-Sachs disease who have a 50%-deficiency of NAG-A activity and for the age difference of the values."

    "abstract": "Tay-Sachs carrier detection testing prior to pregnancy is more desirable than intra-pregnancy testing because it is technically easier, less expensive, and associated with less anxiety and less urgency. However, more than 80% of individuals referred for testing were pregnant women and/or their partners. The literature of the last several years has been silent on these and related issues. A questionnaire designed to determine the factors responsible for these circumstances was sent to 404 physicians (231 obstetrician/gynecologists and 173 internists and family physicians). Of the delivered questionnaires, 49.5% were completed and returned. The majority of obstetrician/gynecologists responding refer patients for Tay-Sachs carrier detection. Internists and family physicians do not, and their responses indicate a lack of pertinent knowledge. In addition, despite physician referral, patients delayed testing until pregnancy. While educational efforts have been targeted to obstetrician/gynecologists, expanded educational activities for internists, family physicians, and patients are required."

    "abstract": "Expression of the hexosaminidase isozymes was evaluated in fibroblast cell lines obtained from two sibs of Lebanese-Christian origin who presented with juvenile-onset Tay-Sachs disease. In the normal control fibroblasts the alpha subunit of hexosaminidase A (hex A) is synthesized as a 67 KD precursor which is cleaved in lysosomes to a mature 54 KD peptide. The patients' fibroblasts were capable of synthesizing the 67 KD precursor but failed to convert it to the mature subunit. The alpha subunit precursor synthesized by patients' cells could not be phosphorylated, nor was the patients' alpha subunit precursor secreted into the medium in response to NH4Cl, which caused accumulation of both alpha and beta subunit precursor in the medium of the normal control fibroblasts. The measurement of residual enzyme activity in the fibroblasts of patients which best correlated with the onset of the illness was the ion exchange chromatographic separation of Hex A-associated hydrolysis of the synthetic substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine-6-sulfate (4MUGS). The patients had 0.32% and 0.36% of Hex A-associated 4MUGS cleaving activity compared to normal control fibroblasts as compared to less than 0.016% for infantile Tay-Sachs disease fibroblasts. The residual Hex A activity in patients' cells had a pH optimum identical with normal enzyme (pH 3.9-4.0), a reduced specific activity for 4MUGS (relative to hydrolysis of unsulfated synthetic substrate), and a greatly enhanced thermal stability. The occurrence of this form of Tay-Sachs disease in Lebanon, the fact that the condition has been described in three unrelated Lebanese immigrant families in Canada, together with the fact that the grandparents of the unrelated probands come from villages in both the northern and southern regions of Lebanon, leads us to speculate that a gene causing juvenile-onset Tay-Sachs disease may not be infrequent in Lebanon."

    "abstract": "Chronic and adult-onset GM2 gangliosidoses are neurological disorders caused by marked deficiency of the A isoenzyme of beta-hexosaminidase; they occur in the Ashkenazi Jewish population, though less frequently than classic (infantile) Tay-Sachs disease. Earlier biosynthetic studies had identified a defective alpha-subunit that failed to associate with the beta-subunit. We have now found a guanosine to adenosine transition at the 3' end of exon 7, which causes substitution of serine for glycine at position 269 of the alpha-subunit [designated 269 (Gly----Ser) substitution]. An RNase protection assay was used to localize the mutation to a segment of mRNA from fibroblasts of a patient with the adult-onset disorder. That segment of mRNA (after reverse transcription) and a corresponding segment of genomic DNA were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction and sequenced by the dideoxy method. The sequence analysis, together with an assay based on the loss of a ScrFI restriction site, showed that the patient was a compound heterozygote who had inherited the 269 (Gly----Ser) mutation from his father and an allelic null mutation from his mother. The 269 (Gly----Ser) mutation, in compound heterozygosity with a presumed null allele, was also found in fetal fibroblasts with an association-defective phenotype and in cells from five patients with chronic GM2 gangliosidosis. It was not found in beta-hexosaminidase A-deficient cells obtained from patients with infantile Tay-Sachs disease nor in cells from individuals who do not have beta-hexosaminidase A deficiency. However, there must be additional mutations with similar consequences, since the 269 (Gly----Ser) substitution was not present in fibroblasts from two patients with juvenile GM2 gangliosidosis even though these had an association-defective alpha-subunit."

This disorder, like infantile Tay-Sachs disease, is more frequent in the Ashkenazi Jewish population. A point mutation in the alpha-chain gene was identified that results in the substitution of Gly with Ser in eight Ashkenazi adult GM2 gangliosidosis patients from five different families. This amino acid substitution was shown to depress drastically the catalytic activity of the alpha chain after expression in COS-1 cells. All of these patients proved to be compound heterozygotes of the allele with the Gly to Ser change and one of the two Ashkenazi infantile Tay-Sachs alleles. These findings will aid in the diagnosis and understanding of beta-hexosaminidase A deficiency disorders."
