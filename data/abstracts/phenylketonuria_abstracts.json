    "abstract": "Expanded carrier screening (ECS) enables proactive identification of at-risk couples (ARCs) and individuals, facilitating informed reproductive decision-making through genetic counseling. This study evaluates the clinical utility of ECS among the population in Anhui Province, China, where its implementation remains understudied. Retrospectively analysis of genetic testing results assessed the carrier frequencies for targeted diseases, identified prevalent pathogenic genes and variants, and ARCs detection rate alongside associated reproductive choices and pregnancy outcomes. In this single-center retrospective study (June 2020-October 2023), 2,530 reproductive-aged individuals (486 couples; 1,558 individuals) underwent next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based ECS using a customized panel targeting 152 recessive monogenic disorders. Carrier rates, pathogenic variants, ARC detection, and subsequent reproductive outcomes were analyzed. Overall, 38.50% (974/2,530) of participants carried ≥ 1 pathogenic/likely pathogenic (P/LP) variant. The most prevalent autosomal recessive (AR) disorders included DFNB4 (3.08%), DFNB1A (2.81%), Wilson disease (2.57%), Krabbe disease (2.37%), and phenylketonuria (2.13%). Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD, 0.28%) was the most common X-linked (XL) disorder. Twenty ARCs (4.12%, 20/486) were identified, including sixteen pregnant couples. Among these, 56.25% (9/16) opted for invasive prenatal diagnosis, confirming eight unaffected fetuses with healthy live births and one twin pregnancy requiring selective termination of an affected fetus. Five pregnant ARCs declined prenatal diagnosis, four of whom delivered healthy infants, while one pregnancy was terminated due to structural anomalies. Of three non-pregnant ARCs, two pursued preimplantation genetic testing for monogenic disorders (PGT-M), resulting in one healthy birth. Our study demonstrated that the ECS for reproductive-age individuals can identify couples and individuals at risk of conceiving a child with a recessive genetic disorder and support reproductive choices through the provision of genetic counseling to reduce the likelihood of offspring with congenital anomalies."

    "title": "Intelligence quotient scores among early-treated phenylketonuria patients: results from a systematic literature review.",
    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a rare condition that causes the accumulation of phenylalanine; without prompt diagnosis and treatment following birth, severe neurologic and cognitive impairments occur. While dietary management can help reduce Phe levels, adherence is challenging and deficits in cognitive function often remain. The importance of the exact features of dietary management, treatment, and control at different time points with respect to eventual IQ scores has not been established. The objective of the present study was to review and describe published data on the impact of PKU on cognition as measured by IQ among PKU patients receiving early dietary management. A systematic literature review was conducted following PRISMA guidelines to examine IQ among patients with PKU. Instruments used to assess IQ included the Wechsler Intelligence Scale, Culture Fair Intelligence Test and Stanford Binet Test. Results were reported overall and by subgroups. Twenty-five out of 28 identified studies could be included in the review. Lower IQ scores were generally observed among those with high phenylalanine levels, although variations in the study populations hinder the ability to make comparisons. Mean IQ scores among those with PKU were consistently lower compared to control groups. Even though all patients in this review received early treatment, those with poor dietary adherence and higher phenylalanine levels tended to show poorer cognitive ability. Cognition is affected in PKU, despite early and continuous dietary management. Treatments are needed that reduce phenylalanine levels so that the burden of neurocognitive impairment in PKU can be alleviated."

This narrative review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current understanding of Lac-AA, emphasising their biosynthesis, physiological roles, and potential implications in various diseases. We discuss the discovery of Lac-AA as signalling molecules, and their involvement in exercise-induced appetite suppression, energy metabolism, and other pathways. This review explores the complex relationship between Lac-AA and various pathological conditions, including mitochondrial disorders, type 2 diabetes, phenylketonuria, cancer, and rosacea. We also examine the interplay between Lac-AA and the gut microbiota, as well as their association with metformin treatment. Furthermore, we address the ongoing debate regarding whether Lac-AA are merely reflections of lactate and amino acid levels or independent signalling molecules. This review synthesises the latest research findings, highlights the significance of Lac-AA in metabolic research, and identifies promising avenues for future investigation in this rapidly evolving field."

    "abstract": "In 2001, Brazil implemented a national newborn screening (NBS) for various conditions, including phenylketonuria (PKU). Data is lacking on the effectiveness of the NBS program in diagnosing PKU at birth and initiating treatment with a Phe-free amino acid-based formula within 30 days of diagnosis. This study evaluated the effectiveness of the NBS program and characterized the PKU population. An observational, repeated cross-sectional population-based study was conducted using anonymized data from the Department of Informatics of the Unified Health System (DATASUS) in Brazil from 2008 to 2021. Only patients with confirmed diagnoses were included. NBS coverage of live births within 30 days of birth was >80% for all years, while annual incidence of PKU ranged from 4 to 8 per 100,000 live births. Median time to screening diagnosis from birth was approximately 18 days (all years). DATASUS had 7615 patients with a record of PKU. The median age of the first record in DATASUS was 6.1 years, predominantly from the southeast region (53%). Also, 44% of the PKU population had a record of receiving Phe-free formula for treatment. Metabolic and related disorders were most prevalent in those <18 years of age (28.1%), while mental and behavioral disorders were most prevalent in those ≥18 years of age (100%). Further investigations are necessary to enhance the effectiveness of NBS coverage, reduce the time from diagnosis to treatment initiation, improve Phe-free formula distribution, and improve DATASUS data quality. The current study was funded by BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Novato, CA."

    "title": "Endoplasmic reticulum stress pathways and cellular death mechanisms in patients with phenylketonuria.",
    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an inherited metabolic disease of amino acid metabolism characterized by the deficiency of activity in phenylalanine (Phe) hydroxylase enzyme, leading to the accumulation of Phe and its metabolites in the blood and tissues of affected patients. PKU, caused by various mutations leading to misfolded or nonfunctional proteins in the cells, still has an incompletely understood pathophysiology. This study aims to investigate the role of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and ER stress response in PKU pathophysiology. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from PKU patients carrying distinct protein misfolding mutations were analyzed to investigate the involvement of ER stress-related gene expression and cell death pathways. A comprehensive evaluation was conducted using quantitative real-time PCR and flow cytometry under both physiological (basal) conditions and following Phe administration, with the aim of elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying Phe-induced cellular stress. Our results demonstrates that PKU patients exhibit a response to ER stress mediated by the IRE1 and ATF6 pathways of the UPR. We also observe disruptions in autophagic flux, as shown by the expression results of LC3B and p62 proteins. Importantly, the PBMCs do not appear to undergo immediate apoptotic cell death. The avoidance of apoptosis induction, even in the context of acute Phe treatment in the PBMCs of PKU patients who have been chronically exposed to ER stress, indicates an adaptive mechanism that facilitates cellular survival in these patients. By focusing on the ER stress response in PKU patients with different type of mutations leading to protein misfolding, this study has the potential to provide new insights into PKU pathophysiology."

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a genetic defect caused by lack of liver enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH). This deficiency results in elevated blood Phenylalanine (Phe) levels and neurotoxicity which is manifested by reduced brain size, lower neurotransmitter levels, and reduced myelination. The goal of this study was to investigate brain myelination defects and their reversibility upon blood Phe lowering by analyzing the corpus callosum (CC) of adult Pah<sup>enu2</sup> (PAH-deficient) mice. MRI and immunostaining demonstrated a significant reduction in CC volume in Pah<sup>enu2</sup> mice. Treatment with an adeno-associated vector (AAV) encoding mouse PAH for 3.5 months improved but did not completely normalize CC volume. Total cholesterol, a major component of myelin, was unchanged in the CC of Pah<sup>enu2</sup> mouse while some sterol intermediates were significantly reduced by treatment. Single nuclei transcriptomics showed upregulation of oxidative stress-related pathways, and increased expression of transthyretin, ApoE, Cst3, and Cd81 in CC in Pah<sup>enu2</sup> mice. Normalization of blood Phe restored gene expression to levels comparable to heterozygous mice and was associated with generation of differentiated myelin-producing oligodendrocyte subtypes and neuroprotective astrocytes. In summary, Pah<sup>enu2</sup> mice showed white matter abnormalities and changes in transcriptome and sterol profiles, which were partially corrected by normalization of blood Phe."

    "title": "Experimental Animal Models of Phenylketonuria: Pros and Cons.",
    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a common inherited metabolic disorder characterised by impaired metabolism of the amino acid phenylalanine. The disease results from a mutation in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) enzyme, which converts phenylalanine (Phe) into tyrosine (Tyr). The absence or inactivity of this enzyme results in significantly elevated levels of Phe in the blood, which can lead to severe neurological conditions, including intellectual disability, epilepsy, and other developmental disorders. Since its discovery, animal models have played a crucial role for understanding the pathophysiology of PKU, as well as providing recognisable proof of targets and surveying new remedial specialists and in vivo medicines. In the present study, we conducted a comprehensive review of the experimental and non-experimental animal models employed for phenylketonuria and its associated complications."

    "abstract": "<b>Introduction</b>: Protein substitutes (PSs) free of phenylalanine (Phe) represent the primary source of proteins and micronutrients in dietary management of classical Phenylketonuria (PKU). Over the last few years, the composition of PSs has undergone rapid and significant improvements, including the development of slow-release amino acid technologies, the introduction of glycomacropeptide-based products, as well as enhancements in taste and the variety of available formulations. However, their micronutrient content has received limited attention. This work aims to analyse the micronutrient composition of all PS formulations available in Italy for paediatric PKU patients and compare their micronutrient contribution to the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) and assess variability among products and age groups. <b>Materials and Methods</b>: The content of 28 micronutrients was analysed in 63 PSs, grouped according to the age ranges defined by the RDA guidelines: 0-6 months, 6-12 months, 1-3 years, 3-8 years, 8-14 years. The micronutrient content was standardised for 10 g of protein equivalent (PE). <b>Results</b>: Compared to the RDA, many micronutrients were found to be over-supplemented across all age groups, particularly in the 0-6 month group, where peak levels were observed for vitamin K, chromium, and manganese. The 1-3 age group showed the lowest levels of supplementation, with most micronutrients falling within the sub-supplementation range. The variability in supplementation among PSs was broad and showed the highest values in the latter age ranges, reaching maximum levels for biotin and copper. Among different ages, the variability was higher in the first two age ranges, particularly for vitamin A. Choline is not supplemented in many PSs across different age ranges. <b>Conclusions:</b> Many micronutrients supplemented in the PSs exceed the RDA for all age groups, with high variability among different PSs and age groups. When prescribing a PS, the daily amount of synthetic proteins of the diet should be considered in order to evaluate the real daily intake of micronutrients in a PKU diet."

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a rare disease. Children who are diagnosed with PKU often encounter psycho-behavioral difficulties, which can significantly impact quality of life and social integration. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of psycho-behavioral difficulties and explore potential factors associated with their occurrence in PKU children aged 6-18 years. From May 2022 to May 2024, 100 children with PKU were recruited using a questionnaire-based survey. Data were analyzed using the STATA (version 18.0) and R programming language (version 4.3.3). 25% of children aged 6-18 years with PKU exhibited psycho-behavioral problems. Significant factors associated with psycho-behavioral problems in study children included body mass index (multi-adjusted odds ratio, 95% confidence interval, P: 1.135, 1.010-1.276, 0.033), age (3.169, 1.024-9.804, 0.045), pregnancy order (0.143, 0.033-0.607, 0.008), delivery order (0.041, 0.004-0.373, 0.005), mode of disease diagnosis (5.730, 1.935-16.963, 0.002), and dietary therapy pressure (3.321, 1.083-10.181, 0.036). Based on these significant factors, a nomogram model was constructed with descent prediction capability and accuracy. We identified six factors closely associated with psycho-behavioral problems in PKU children, offering insights into risk profiles underlying these problems and guiding the formulation of effective prevention strategies."

    "title": "Impact of a mobile health intervention on health management among children with phenylketonuria based on a multi-theory model of the behavior change wheel theory and family health theory: protocol for a randomized controlled trial.",
    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a hereditary metabolic disorder caused by mutations in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (<i>PAH</i>) gene, leading to the accumulation of phenylalanine (Phe) in the blood. Without timely treatment, PKU patients may develop irreversible intellectual and neurocognitive deficits. The primary treatment for PKU is a strict low-Phe diet, which must be initiated in early life to achieve better outcomes. Therefore, parents and parents' caregivers play a crucial role in dietary management. However, poor dietary adherence and inadequate health knowledge significantly affect treatment efficacy. Mobile health (mHealth) interventions, as an emerging health management approach, offer personalized, low-cost, and highly accessible solutions. This study aims to develop and evaluate an mHealth intervention model based on the Behavior Change Wheel (BCW) theory and family health theory to improve health management for children with PKU. This single-center, single-blind randomized controlled trial will be conducted at the Inner Mongolia Maternity and Child Health Care Hospital in China from March to September 2025. Participants will include children with PKU and their parents' caregivers, who will be randomly assigned to either the intervention group (receiving mHealth interventions via WeChat) or the control group (receiving routine health education). The intervention will include health education, dietary management, regular monitoring reminders, and online consultation services. The primary outcome will be the serum phenylalanine and tyrosine levels of the children. Secondary outcomes will include nutritional indicators, intellectual development indicators, and the caregivers' health knowledge, compliance, and mental health. Data collection will occur at baseline and at 3 and 6 months post-intervention. By integrating the BCW and family health theories, this study innovatively develops an mHealth-based health management intervention model for PKU. This model is expected to enhance family health management capabilities and improve clinical outcomes and quality of life for children with PKU. If effective, this model can be extended to other regions to provide more convenient and efficient health management solutions for PKU patients."

    "title": "Are protein substitutes available in Italy for infants with inherited metabolic diseases all the same?",
    "abstract": "Inherited metabolic diseases (IMDs) represent a major clinical challenge, especially during the neonatal and infant periods. They require tailored and long-term nutritional management to ensure proper growth and development. Protein substitutes are essential in the dietary treatment of IMDs, particularly aminoacidopathies, organic acidemias, and urea cycle disorders. In Italy, a variety of PSs is available for infants with IMDs requiring a controlled protein and/or amino acid intake; however, differences in their nutritional composition may impact clinical outcomes. This study aims to examine and compare the nutritional composition of infant PSs (IPSs) available on the Italian market, focusing on macronutrients, micronutrients, and functional components. The analysis targets products used in the dietary management of aminoacidopathies, organic acidemias, and urea cycle disorders during the first year of life. We compared the nutritional composition of products intended for healthy infants, considering the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/127 and Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/128. Phenylketonuria is excluded from this analysis, as it has been recently addressed in another paper. For each condition, there are only two products available, except for isovaleric aciduria and urea cycle disorders, which have only one product. The results indicate higher energy, linoleic, and alpha-linolenic acid content (+9%, +55%, and +290% compared to the maximum reference value), and lower levels of lactose, vitamin D, choline, selenium, and iodine (-92%, -34%, -37%, -12%, and -39% compared to the minimum reference value) for several IPSs. The analysis revealed the presence of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) in all IPSs, while half of them contain arachidonic acid (ARA). This study represents the first comprehensive comparison of the nutritional profiles of IPSs for IMDs on the Italian market. The results identify potential areas for optimization, aiming to provide adequate levels of micronutrients, essential fatty acids, and functional ingredients, such as biotics, to support gut health, immune function, and neurodevelopment."

    "abstract": "Because of CO's known endogenous signaling roles and its demonstrated pharmacological activity at low and safe concentrations, there is considerable interest in chemical strategies that allows for generation of carbon monoxide from organic molecules under near-physiological conditions. Along this line, we report our work on studying the ability of iron porphyrin to catalyze CO generation from phenylpyruvic acid (PPA). To utilize this system for potential CO therapeutics and diagnostic applications, an activated charcoal formulation was designed, optimized, and assessed. Among the various iron porphyrin analogs studied, tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)porphyrin iron (III) (TPFP) immobilized on activated charcoal was found to produce up to 60% CO from PPA. This chemistry could also be utilized in PKU diagnostics for quantification of PPA accumulation in urine. This catalytic conversion allows for the use of CO generation to rapidly quantify PPA concentration in urine samples. Another potential relevance of this CO generation pathway is the extent to which it could undergo <i>in vivo</i> as an endogenous source of CO."

Symptoms include hypopigmentation, a musty, mouse-like smell and various neurological complications. Treatment options include (i) dietary restriction of Phe with supplementation of other amino acids and micronutrients through medical mixtures, (ii) daily dosing of large neutral amino acids, (iii) synthetic forms of BH4 and (iv) bacterial phenylalanine ammonia lyase enzymes. The primary goal of treatment is to lower blood Phe levels and improve quality of life. However, treatment is very demanding for patients as well as their families, and not all treatment options are applicable to every patient. This review gives a state-of-the-art overview of current treatment options for all PKU patients and additionally speculates on future therapeutic approaches."

This study comprised genomic profiling and phenotypic characterization of 131 Serbian PKU patients along with implications for BH4 therapy. By combining Sanger sequencing, MLPA and WES re-analysis of previously unsolved cases, we identified 38 different disease causing variants in the PAH gene and classified them using ACMG guidelines. The most frequent variant was p.Leu48Ser (30.92%), followed by p.Arg408Trp (12.21%) and p.Ile306Val (8%). We detected one novel variant, p.Pro416Leu, which was classified as pathogenic, based on computational algorithms prediction, with destabilization as the mechanism of the effect upon PAH protein. For patients' phenotypic classification, we used pre-treatment serum Phe level and Phe tolerance, indicating that 42% of patients had classic PKU, 22% had mild PKU and 32% were classified as MHP (4% remained unclassified). Furthermore, we performed genotype-phenotype correlation study which emphasized the inconsistency of p.Leu48Ser variant. Given that not all PKU patients benefit from genotype-based therapy (Kuvan and sepiapterin), we assessed the potential responsiveness in our patients. We categorized all detected PAH genotypes accordingly and with 39.1% responsive and 44.5% probably responsive found that majority of patients may respond to BH4 therapy. Our study brings the updated spectrum of molecular genetic data, variant classification, characterization of novel p.Pro416Leu variant, detailed phenotypic characteristics and BH4 responsiveness for PKU patients from Serbia, therefore contributing to better understanding of molecular landscape of PKU."

    "abstract": "The organization of care profoundly impacts the variability in the quality of care provided to patients and the equity of access to care. The lack of coordination of care, of communication among healthcare providers, healthcare professionals, and patients, and the duplication of services provided to the patients represent some paradigmatic examples of organizational barriers to deliver high-quality patient-centered care and to promote equitable access to healthcare services. Patient care pathways (PCPs) are valuable tools for the (re)design and the (re)definition of the provision of healthcare services to patients. This work represents the first application of the RarERN Path<sup>©</sup> methodology for the (re)design of Patient Care Pathways (PCPs) to Ataxias, Dystonia, and Phenylketonuria (PKU). The study was conducted with the support of Academic Partners and in collaboration with experts from two of the 24 European Reference Networks for rare diseases (ERN RND and MetabERN). The application of some of the phases of RarERN Path<sup>©</sup> methodology enabled the translation of the good practices already in place in the centers of expertise into a common optimized PCP, one for each of the three diseases, integrating the expertise of some reference centers of excellence with the patients' perspectives, and principally focusing on the organization of care. The PCPs proposed for progressive ataxias, dystonia, and PKU provide insight into the value of specialized centers in diagnosing and managing patients with rare and complex conditions and are the results of a co-designed optimized process integrating the good practices of the centers of excellence and expertise with the perspectives of the patients' representatives. This integrated approach allowed for the re-design and optimization of the organizational dimensions of the patient's care pathways."

This study aimed to assess the clinical characteristics of 1103 infants referred to a single center due to positive newborn screening (NBS) tests for PKU, providing insights into screening and diagnosis. The health records of infants who were referred with suspicion of PKU through the Turkish national NBS program to a single referral center between January 2016 and January 2023 were retrospectively reviewed. The study analyzed demographic data, clinical findings, and diagnostic results from hospital records. Logistic regression analysis identified significant predictors of age at admission. This study highlights significant regional differences within Türkiye regarding DBS collection, result reporting, and age at admission. Significant delays in age at admission (expressed as median, [Q1-Q3]) were noted in the Eastern Anatolia (34 days [27-42]), Southeastern Anatolia [34 days (25-42)], and Black Sea regions [26 days (19-33)]. Out of the referred infants, 5.1% and 2.4% had transient tyrosinemia and transient hyperphenylalaninemia, respectively, and these transient conditions were more prevalent among neonates with a history of jaundice. Phenylalanine level was normal in 38.1% of the patients and was considered false positive. Among the 26 (2.36%) patients admitted after 90 days (late admissions), there were 2 PKU patients with untreated Phe levels >20 mg/dL (n=2). Among the 140 infants requiring treatment, 1.43% (n=2) were late admissions (>90 days). A history of PKU in the family and higher initial Phe levels were associated with earlier admissions. This comprehensive analysis underscores the need to enhance NBS programs, particularly in regions with identified delays. Improving healthcare infrastructure, increasing awareness, and implementing targeted health policies are crucial for timely diagnosis and treatment. Future research should address regional disparities and optimize screening protocols to improve outcomes for affected infants."

This study aims to assess the prevalence of carriers for common autosomal recessive and X-linked conditions among Vietnamese pregnant women and to identify common mutations within these genes. A cross-sectional study was conducted with 8,464 Vietnamese pregnant women with indications for carrier screening tests for recessive disorders from November 2022 to August 2023 at the Institute of DNA Technology and Genetic Analysis. The survey includes demographic information, and the genetic screening was conducted using next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques, focusing on 13 specific recessive conditions. 8,464 Vietnamese pregnant women's records were involved in this study. 1,928 of them carried at least one genetic recessive condition, representing the frequency of a recessive disorder was 22.8%. The highest recessive disorders rate among pregnant women was found for the G6PD gene mutation (G6PD deficiency) at a rate of about 1 in 20 individuals, followed by the HBA1 and HBA2 gene mutations (Alpha Thalassemia) at a rate of about 1 in 25. Other common recessive carrier genes included SRD5A2 (5-alpha reductase deficiency) at a rate of about 1 in 27, HBB (Beta Thalassemia) at a rate of about 1 in 28, ATP7B (Wilson's disease) at a rate of about 1 in 40, PAH (Phenylketonuria) at a rate of about 1 in 40, and SLC25A13 (Citrin deficiency) at a rate of about 1 in 45. The prevalence of recessive carriers among Vietnamese pregnant women is high, and at least 1 in 5 pregnant women carries one recessive gene. It is essential to encourage Vietnamese pregnant women to conduct recessive carrier screening tests to reduce mortality rates among children and to implement effective pregnancy planning and childbirth."

    "title": "Modelling Population Genetic Screening in Rare Neurodegenerative Diseases.",
    "abstract": "<b>Importance:</b> Genomic sequencing enables the rapid identification of a breadth of genetic variants. For clinical purposes, sequencing for small genetic variations is considered a solved problem, while challenges remain for structural variants, given the lower sensitivity and specificity. Interest has recently risen among governing bodies in developing protocols for population-wide genetic screening. However, usefulness is constrained when the probability of being affected by a rare disease remains low, despite a positive genetic test. This is a common scenario in neurodegenerative disorders. The problem is recognised among statisticians and statistical geneticists but is less well-understood by clinicians and researchers who will act on these results, and by the general public who might access screening services directly without the appropriate support for interpretation. <b>Observations:</b> We explore the probability of subsequent disease following genetic screening of several variants, both single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and larger repeat expansions, for two neurological conditions, Huntington's disease (HD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), comparing these results with screening for phenylketonuria, which is well-established. The risk following a positive screening test was 0.5% for <i>C9orf72</i> in ALS and 0.4% for <i>HTT</i> in HD when testing repeat expansions, for which the test had sub-optimal performance (sensitivity = 99% and specificity = 90%), and 12.7% for phenylketonuria and 10.9% for ALS <i>SOD1</i> when testing pathogenic SNVs (sensitivity = 99.96% and specificity = 99.95%). Subsequent screening confirmation via PCR for <i>C9orf72</i> led to a 2% risk of developing ALS as a result of the reduced penetrance (44%). <b>Conclusions and Relevance:</b> We show that risk following a positive screening test result can be strikingly low for rare neurological diseases, even for fully penetrant variants such as <i>HTT</i>, if the test has sub-optimal performance. Accordingly, to maximise the utility of screening, it is vital to prioritise protocols with very high sensitivity and specificity, and a careful selection of markers for screening, giving regard to clinical interpretability, actionability, high penetrance, and secondary testing to confirm positive findings."

Retrospective chart review study. Patients with PKU who underwent the 24 h responsiveness test, including correction for natural PHE fluctuations, were included. Responders were defined as those who exhibited a >30% reduction in PHE levels within 8 h and/or 24 h after intake of 20 mg/kg sapropterin, correcting for the natural fluctuation in plasma PHE levels on day 1. Patients with a 28-30% reduction in PHE were considered sapropterin-responsive only if they had a concordant genotype. Fifteen patients completed the test; however, three were excluded due to non-compliance. Additionally, one patient with mild PKU exhibited a borderline response, but the genotype agreement could not be assessed, rendering the test inconclusive. The rate of responsiveness could be assessed for eleven patients (six mild and five classical PKU). Among the patients with mild PKU, four were classified as responders: three at both 8 h and 24 h (reduction in plasma PHE: -75.9 ± 20.2% at 8 h and -75.7 ± 37.0% at 24 h) and one at 8 h only (reduction in plasma PHE: -28.7%). All patients with classic PKU (<i>n</i> = 5) were non-responders. A 24 h sapropterin responsiveness test incorporating correction for natural fluctuations in PHE levels identified a proportion of sapropterin-responsive patients with mild PKU similar to that described in the literature. PHE consumption should be objectively controlled during the protocol to avoid bias in determining responsiveness."

    "abstract": "The c.1199 + 502 A > T variant of the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene, which is the most frequently reported deep intronic variant involved in phenylketonuria (PKU), is mainly observed in patients with classical or mild PKU. Prior to this study, no mouse models of PKU featuring deep intronic variants of PAH had been reported. To phenotypically simulate the pathogenicity of this variant, we used CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology and homologous recombination to generate homozygous PKU model mice with a partially humanized Pah gene incorporating human PAH exons 11-12 carrying c.1199 + 502 A > T or wild-type (c.1199 + 502WT) control sequences. Humanized homozygous Pah c.1199 + 502 A > T mice exhibited a classical PKU phenotype, including a higher serum phenylalanine concentration, yellowing of the fur, and other traits. The homozygous mutant group had poorer spatial learning and spatial memory compared with the wild-type group. This construction of the first humanized mice carrying a deep intronic variant of PAH provides a new animal model for the pathogenesis and treatment of PKU, and may serve as a reference for future research on the pathogenicity of deep intronic variation."

    "abstract": "Pegvaliase is an enzyme substitution therapy for phenylketonuria, an autosomal recessive disorder of amino acid metabolism resulting in phenylalanine (Phe) accumulation, intellectual disability, and behavioral/psychiatric disorders. The phase 3 PRISM trials (NCT01819727, NCT01889862, NCT03694353) established pegvaliase efficacy in reducing blood Phe, but its pharmacokinetics differs between individuals, resulting in varying times to achieve clinically meaningful blood Phe targets. Using participant-level data from PRISM, we developed a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model that explains individual-level blood Phe patterns as a function of pegvaliase clearance during the maintenance phase. As pegvaliase exposure induces immune tolerization, drug clearance declines. A period of high sensitivity of blood Phe to dietary Phe intake and pegvaliase exposure is observed at ∼120-200 μmol/L Phe, reflected in increased blood Phe volatility. This model suggests that this volatility represents impending, but incomplete, tolerization, and that reducing pegvaliase dose or liberalizing dietary Phe intake at or before this stage is premature and can result in marked blood Phe increases. With continued exposure, pegvaliase clearance continues to decline, and dietary Phe intake and blood Phe become uncoupled. These analyses establish how tolerization presents clinically and suggest a staged therapeutic approach: (1) tolerance induction; (2) diet liberalization; (3) gradual dose adjustment."

    "abstract": "Individuals with phenylketonuria (PKU) are at increased risk for obesity, possibly due to reduced satiety induced by a PKU diet that is low protein and high carbohydrate. It is unclear how exercise alters postprandial satiety after a PKU-like meal. The objective was to examine changes in postprandial satiety, satiety hormone concentrations, energy expenditure and substrate oxidation in response to acute treadmill exercise following a PKU-like meal. Sixteen males (mean age [±SD]: 26.5 ± 4.8 years; BMI: 23.7 ± 3.2 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) participated in a randomized cross-over trial with two conditions: exercise and control. Both trials involved consuming a PKU-like meal comprising naturally low-protein foods, a special low-protein food and a protein substitute. In the exercise trial, participants exercised at 60% of maximal oxygen uptake for 1 h before the meal; in the control trial, they rested. Satiety agents (peptide YY [PYY], glucagon-like peptide-1 [GLP-1] and growth differentiation factor-15 [GDF-15]), appetite, energy expenditure, fat oxidation and carbohydrate oxidation were measured. Mean (±SE) appetite and postprandial PYY and GLP-1 concentrations were unaffected by exercise (P ≥ 0.279). However, GDF-15 was higher in the exercise trial (control: 288 ± 25 pg/mL vs. exercise: 322 ± 24 pg/mL; P = 0.002). Exercise increased fat oxidation (P = 0.013) and decreased carbohydrate oxidation post-meal (P = 0.022), with concomitantly lower RER (P = 0.005). Energy expenditure rose during exercise (P < 0.001), but no difference occurred postprandially (P = 0.543). Acute exercise prior to a PKU-like meal does not affect postprandial GLP-1 and PYY concentrations compared to control but GDF-15 was increased and RER was reduced, potentially improving appetite regulation."

    "abstract": "Prime editing is a versatile genome editing technology that circumvents the need for DNA double-strand break formation and homology-directed repair, making it particularly suitable for in vivo correction of pathogenic mutations. Here we developed liver-specific prime editing approaches with temporally restricted prime editor (PE) expression. We first established a dual-delivery approach where the prime editor guide RNA is continuously expressed from adeno-associated viral vectors and only the PE is transiently delivered as nucleoside-modified mRNA encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles (LNP). This strategy achieved 26.2% editing with PEmax and 47.4% editing with PE7 at the Dnmt1 locus using a single 2 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> dose of mRNA-LNP. When targeting the pathogenic Pah<sup>enu2</sup> mutation in a phenylketonuria mouse model, gene correction rates reached 4.3% with PEmax and 20.7% with PE7 after three doses of 2 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> mRNA-LNP, effectively reducing blood L-phenylalanine levels from over 1,500 µmol l<sup>-1</sup> to below the therapeutic threshold of 360 µmol l<sup>-1</sup>. Encouraged by the high efficiency of PE7, we next explored a simplified approach where PE7 mRNA was co-delivered with synthetic prime editor guide RNAs encapsulated in LNP. This strategy yielded 35.9% editing after two doses of RNA-LNP at the Dnmt1 locus and 8.0% editing after three doses of RNA-LNP at the Pah<sup>enu2</sup> locus, again reducing L-phenylalanine levels below 360 µmol l<sup>-1</sup>. These findings highlight the therapeutic potential of mRNA-LNP-based prime editing for treating phenylketonuria and other genetic liver diseases, offering a scalable and efficient platform for future clinical translation."

In addition to an update of the previous 70 recommendations, 20 new topics were included, resulting in a total of 87 statements in this first revision of the guidelines. Research publications were reviewed up until September 2022. Evidence was graded as high, moderate, low, very low or expert opinion and the recommendations were graded conditional or strong according to GRADE methodology. All recommendations were discussed during 14 plenary online or in person meetings. Recommendations were accepted if more than 75 % of the professionals were in agreement.

This case-control study aimed to compare the values of atherosclerosis risk factors, including insulin resistance (IR), dyslipidemia, mean of platelet volume (MPV), and systemic inflammation in adult PKU patients. Fifty patients with PKU were categorized into two groups: well-controlled (WC) (plasma Phe < 600 µmol/L) and poorly controlled (PC) (Phe > 600 µmol/L). Twenty-five age -, gender -, and BMI-matched healthy individuals were enrolled as the control group. Serum insulin, fasting blood sugar (FBS), and lipids were measured. The systemic inflammatory index (SII) and systemic inflammatory response index (SIRI) were calculated using the counts of neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, and platelets. Both PKU groups had lower serum cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, and high-density lipoprotein than the healthy subjects (p < 0.001). No significant difference was observed in IR between the PKU patients and the control group. MPV was significantly higher in the patients with PKU compared to the healthy controls. The levels of SII and SIRI were substantially lower in the WC group compared to the healthy control group and the PC group. All in all, a higher level of dyslipidemia and MPV were observed in patients with PKU compared to healthy individuals. SII and SIRI were significantly lowered in the WC group compared to the PC group and healthy individuals, suggesting the role of adherence to a restricted diet in reducing the risk of systemic inflammation in patients with PKU."

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU), an inborn error of phenylalanine (Phe) metabolism, is a common cause of intellectual disability. However, the mechanisms by which elevated phenylalanine (Phe) levels cause cognitive impairment remain unclear. Here, we show that submillimolar Phe perturbs synaptic plasticity through the hyperactivation of GluN2B-containing NMDARs. PahEnu2 PKU model mice exhibited submillimolar and supramillimolar concentrations of Phe in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum, respectively. L-Phe produced concentration-dependent bidirectional effects on NMDA-induced currents, without affecting synaptic NMDARs in hippocampal CA1 neurons. L-Phe-induced hyperactivation of extrasynaptic GluN2B resulted in activity-dependent downregulation of AMPARs during burst or sustained synaptic activity. Administration of L-Phe in mice decreased neural activity and impaired memory, which were blocked by pretreatment with GluN2B inhibitors. Furthermore, pharmacological and virus-mediated suppression of GluN2B reversed the impaired learning in PahEnu2 mice. Collectively, these results suggest that the concentration of Phe in the CSF of patients with PKU perturbs extrasynaptic NMDARs and synaptic plasticity, and that suppression of GluN2B may have the potential to improve cognitive function in patients with PKU."

    "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder caused by mutations in the <i>PAH</i> gene, resulting in deficient phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) enzyme activity and neurotoxic phenylalanine accumulation. Untreated PKU results in progressive neurodegeneration and severe intellectual disability. Neonatal screening has evolved from the Guthrie test to advanced techniques like HPLC, tandem mass spectrometry, and next-generation sequencing (NGS) for molecular confirmation. This study aimed to develop a rapid, scalable <i>PAH</i> genetic assay using Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONTs) to enhance neonatal screening in high-prevalence regions like Türkiye, through accelerated, cost-effective genetic diagnostics. <b>Methods:</b> An in-house panel was designed, implemented, and benchmarked against results obtained from the Illumina sequencing platform. A cohort of 40 PKU patients, previously diagnosed using Illumina platform, was selected for this study. Gene-specific primers were strategically designed to amplify exonic regions, untranslated segments, and exon-intron junctions of the <i>PAH</i> gene. Sequencing libraries were then prepared and processed using the MinION Mk1c instrument, with subsequent data analysis conducted through the Guppy software and complementary bioinformatics tools. <b>Results:</b> The findings showed complete agreement between the ONT and Illumina platforms, corroborating the high fidelity and reliability of the ONT-based assay. All pathogenic variants previously identified through Illumina sequencing were accurately detected, albeit with varying observed allele frequencies. Notably, the most prevalent variants identified in the patient cohort were NC_000012.12(NM_000277.3):c.1066-11G > A with a frequency of 37.5% and NC_000012.12(NM_000277.3):c.782G > A, at 15%. <b>Conclusion:</b> The ONT-based single-gene testing for PKU demonstrated complete concordance with Illumina sequencing, validating its accuracy and reliability. This method effectively detects pathogenic variants and offers a faster, cost-effective solution for neonatal screening, particularly beneficial in high-prevalence regions like Türkiye."

Two of these test batteries, the Amsterdam Neuropsychological Tasks (ANT) and the Cambridge Neuropsychological Automated Test Battery (CANTAB), have indicated impairments in early- and continuously treated phenylketonuria (PKU) patients. However, the tasks of these batteries have never been cross-validated. This study aims to establish the comparability of the two test batteries in the assessment and monitoring of PKU patients and healthy controls. 22 PKU patients and 19 controls of various ages (7-67 years old) were tested twice, once using tasks from the ANT and once using tasks from the CANTAB. Tasks of the two batteries were matched based on the neurocognitive functions they (were deemed to) assess, including motor skills, emotion recognition, sustained attention and executive functions (working memory, inhibitory control, and cognitive flexibility). Correlation matrices were used to assess the specificity of the correlations between tasks assigned to similar skills, versus non-related tasks. Correlations between matched tasks from the ANT and CANTAB ranged from moderate to strong (range ρ: 0.50-0.84, P < 0.001), with strong correlations (ρ > 0.70) for emotion recognition, cognitive flexibility and sustained attention. These correlations remained significant after correcting for age. The strongest correlations were generally found between tasks assigned to require similar skills a-priori, validating the matching between tasks. Overall, there was a good level of agreement between ANT and CANTAB tasks, especially in emotion recognition, sustained attention and the broad construct of executive functioning. These results suggest that a number of ANT and CANTAB tasks assessing the same functions may be used and interpreted interchangeably, which would support a better integration of neuropsychological research in PKU."

Routinely collected clinical and administrative data can be used as sources of deficits to automatically calculate FIs. This scoping review aimed to evaluate the current research landscape on routine data-based FIs. We searched seven databases to find literature published in 2013-2023. Main inclusion criteria were original research articles on FIs constructed from routine data, with deficits in at least two of the following categories: \"symptoms/signs\", \"laboratory values\", \"diseases\", \"disabilities\", and \"others\". From 7526 publications screened, 218 were included. Studies were primarily from North America (47.7 %), conducted in the community (35.3 %), and used routine data-based FIs for risk stratification (51.4 %). FIs were calculated using various routine data sources; however, most were initially developed and validated using hospital records. We noted geographical differences in study settings and routine data sources. We identified 611 unique deficits comprising these FIs. Most were either \"diseases\" (34.4 %) or \"symptoms/signs\" (32.1 %). Routine data-based FIs are feasible and valid risk stratification tools, but research is confined to high-income countries, their routine adoption is slow, and deficits comprising these FIs emphasise a reactive and overtly medical approach in addressing frailty. Future directions include exploring the feasibility and applicability of using routine databases for frailty assessment in lower- and middle-income countries, and leveraging non-clinical routine data through data linkages to proactively identify and manage frailty."

The Reporting Odds Ratio, Proportional Reporting Ratio, Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network, and Multi-item Gamma Poisson Shrinker were used for disproportionality analysis. A screening procedure was implemented for designated medical events, focusing on medication-related adverse events. A total of 6264 reports were identified. Arthralgia was the most frequently reported adverse events. Lymphadenopathy, serum sickness, and tunnel vision were identified as unexpected signals. Weibull distribution analysis revealed that the incidence of adverse events decreased over time.

If untreated, this brain dysfunction results in severe intellectual disability, epilepsy, and behavioural problems. We aimed to investigate demographic, clinical, biochemical, and molecular genetic data in patients with phenylalanine metabolism disorder. This study included 99 predominantly Turkish patients diagnosed with phenylalanine metabolism disorder, primarily referred through newborn screening programs. These patients were evaluated at a single center over a 9-year period, from 2013 to 2021. Demographic, clinical, molecular and laboratory data were collected retrospectively. Among the 99 patients, 93 (93.9%) had hyperphenylalaninemia-phenylketonuria, 2 (2.0%) had tetrahydrobiopterin metabolism disorders [one due to 6-pyruvoyl-tetrahydropterin synthase (PTPS) deficiency and the other due to dihydropteridine reductase (DHPR) deficiency], 3 (3.0%) had maternal PKU syndrome (one of whom also had mild phenylketonuria), and 1 (1.0%) had transient hyperphenylalaninemia. The majority of patients belonged to the mild hyperphenylalaninemia-not requiring treatment group. A total of 33 different alleles and 40 genotypes (59.6% compound heterozygous) were identified in the PAH gene, with missense variants accounting for the largest proportion (72.7%). The most frequent PAH gene variants were c.898G > T p.(Ala300Ser) (14.9%), c.1066-11G > A (8.5%), and c.1208C > T p.(Ala403Val) (8.5%), while the most common genotypes were c.898G > T p.(Ala300Ser)/c.898G > T p.(Ala300Ser) (6.4%) and c.898G > T p.(Ala300Ser) /c.1066-11G > A (6.4%), respectively. Among patients with mild hyperphenylalaninemia-not requiring treatment, the predominant genotypes were c.898G > T p.(Ala300Ser)/c.898G > T p.(Ala300Ser) (11.1%), c.898G > T p.(Ala300Ser)/c.1066-11G > A (11.1%), and c.1208C > T p.(Ala403Val)/c.1208C > T p.(Ala403Val) (7.4%), whereas c.842C > T p.(Pro281Leu)/c.842C > T p.(Pro281Leu) (33.3%) was frequently observed in classic PKU patients. The national newborn screening program has significantly improved the prognosis and quality of life for patients through early diagnosis and timely treatment. While the prevalence of hyperphenylalaninemia-phenylketonuria remains high in Turkey, the higher frequency of the hyperphenylalaninemia-not requiring treatment group, compared to European and Asian countries, is considered a favorable outcome. Additionally, the PAH genotype is identified as the primary determinant of the PKU phenotype."

    "abstract": "<b>Background/Objectives</b>. Maternal phenylketonuria syndrome (MPKUS) is the most serious pregnancy complication of women with phenylketonuria (PKU). High phenylalanine (Phe) levels are indeed embryotoxic for the fetus. A low-Phe diet started before conception and maintained throughout pregnancy ensures optimal blood Phe concentrations (120-360 μmol/L) and pregnancy outcome. Women with unplanned pregnancies are at higher risk of MPKUS and require a rapid and sustained reduction of blood Phe. In this retrospective study, we evaluated the effects of dietary intervention on Phe levels and on the clinical parameters of offspring at birth in a group of patients with PKU. We also describe the fetal outcome of unplanned and untreated mothers with PKU. <b>Methods</b>. The cohort consisted of 13 patients for a total of 22 pregnancies: 16 successful pregnancies and 6 abortions. Pregnancies were divided into three groups: \"Planned Pregnancies, PP (<i>n</i> = 5)\", \"Unplanned Pregnancies, UP (<i>n</i> = 6)\", and \"Unplanned and untreated Pregnancies UT (<i>n</i> = 5)\". <b>Results</b>. Women in the UP group showed higher levels of Phe than women in the PP group, especially during the first trimester. The offspring of the UP group showed no congenital malformations but lower median auxologic parameters at birth compared to those from the PP group, although these were not significantly different. The women in the UT group received the diagnosis of PKU after the birth of offspring with MPKUS. <b>Conclusions</b>. A low-Phe diet is critical to prevent MPKUS, especially when started before conception or no later than the 10th week of gestation. Intensive effort is necessary to avoid unplanned pregnancies and to identify undiagnosed women with PKU at risk of MPKUS."

    "abstract": "<b>Background/Objectives</b>: Inborn errors of metabolism (IEMs) represent a diverse group of genetic disorders characterized by enzymatic defects that disrupt metabolic pathways, leading to toxic metabolite accumulation, deficits, or impaired macromolecule synthesis. While strict dietary interventions are critical for managing many of these conditions, hormonal and metabolic changes during puberty introduce new challenges. Advancements in early diagnosis and treatment have significantly extended the lifespan of individuals with IEMs. However, this increased longevity is associated with heightened risks of new medical problems, including obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), as these complications share mechanistic features with those seen in obesity and T2DM. <b>Methods</b>: This mini-review examines current knowledge of the intricate interplay between pubertal hormones and metabolic pathways in IEM patients. <b>Results</b>: We address critical questions, such as if puberty intensifies the risk of metabolic derangements in these individuals and if there is a metabolic intersection where these disorders converge, leading to shared complications. We highlight the impact of puberty-induced hormonal fluctuations, such as growth hormone (GH) surges and sex steroid activity, on disorders like phenylketonuria, urea cycle defects, and fatty acid oxidation disorders. Moreover, we explore the role of dietary interventions in mitigating or exacerbating these effects, emphasizing the importance of balancing nutritional needs during growth spurts. <b>Conclusions</b>: A multidisciplinary approach integrating endocrinology, nutrition, and emerging therapies is advocated to optimize metabolic health during puberty. Addressing these challenges is critical for improving long-term outcomes for individuals with IEMs, particularly during this pivotal developmental phase."

Untreated, PKU may result in severe and irreversible intellectual impairment due to marked hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA). Guidelines recommend lifelong reduction in Phe levels, usually achieved via a strict low-protein diet and sometimes medications. We discuss the role of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH<sub>4</sub>), an essential PAH cofactor in Phe metabolism, describe the pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, and metabolism of sepiapterin, as well as reporting on its efficacy and safety in children and adults with PKU. Sepiapterin, an oral synthetic form of a natural precursor of BH<sub>4</sub>, can reduce HPA in some patients with PKU. In relatively short-term studies, sepiapterin has been shown to be safe, well tolerated, and like the BH<sub>4</sub> analog sapropterin dihydrochloride effective in reducing blood Phe levels in responsive individuals. The reductions in blood Phe observed with sepiapterin in the phase III APHENITY trial has the potential to allow more PKU patients to attain Phe treatment targets or alternatively easing of the onerous dietary Phe restrictions. Results of longer-term studies in patients with PKU, including neurocognitive and functional outcomes, nutritional status, and quality of life are awaited."

    "abstract": "This narrative review explores a novel challenge to adherence in patients with phenylketonuria (PKU). Traditional barriers to maintaining the core of PKU therapy, which involves dietary restrictions, include limited palatability, high costs, difficult access to low-phenylalanine foods, time constraints, and social interference. We propose that adherence may also be hindered by elevated phenylalanine levels in nonadherent patients, leading to cognitive and executive function impairment that reduces their ability to adhere to the diet. Specifically, we hypothesize that the pathophysiological features of PKU create a vicious cycle that exacerbates adherence challenges to the phenylalanine-restricted diet. We therefore propose that PKU may be considered \"an adherence disease\". The implications of this hypothesis are threefold: 1. Long-term dietary nonadherence is probable among individuals with PKU; 2. the disease itself contributes to the difficulty in adhering to dietary restrictions, potentially alleviating patient guilt; 3. while treatment options depend on individual factors such as disease severity, the most effective approach to mitigating the neurocognitive and psychosocial impacts of PKU is to replace or restore phenylalanine hydroxylase activity."

Although indicated as a standard dietary treatment for these patients, free AAs mixtures are not absorbed as natural proteins, thus creating an oxidized and inflamed state in the intestine. Nowadays, PSs on the market also include slow-release amino acids (SR-AAs) formulas. The present work aims to investigate the effects of an SR-AAs formula on both oxidative and inflammatory status in human intestinal Caco-2 cells, comparing its mechanism of action with that of a mixture of free AAs. In more detail, oxidative stress and inflammation were induced at the cellular level using H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and lipopolysaccharides (LPSs), respectively, and both free AAs and SR-AAs PSs were tested to evaluate if they were able to restore a more balanced condition.

Blood phenylalanine (Phe) has been one of the metabolic biomarkers of the HPA and thus is considered as indicators for HPA management but poses a challenge in invasive sampling. Phenylpyruvic acid (PPA) is also a biomarker of HPA with greatly increased levels in blood and urine of the patients. In the present study, a portable breath sampler was developed for in situ extraction and storage of PPA from exhaled breath metabolites of HPA patients and healthy volunteers, and breath PPA was then identified and quantified by mass spectrometry. The analytical parameters of PPA detection were optimized, showing the good sensitivity (LLOQ: 0.04 ng/mL, S/N = 10), reproducibility (intraday RSDs: 6.18 % for 0.2 ng/mL, 7.32 % for 1.0 ng/mL, n = 6; inter-day RSDs: 6.08 % for 0.2 ng/mL, 11.29 % for 1.0 ng/mL, n = 6), and recoveries (intraday: 83.34 % for 0.2 ng/mL, 81.73 % for 1.0 ng/mL, n = 6; inter-day: 88.44 % for 0.2 ng/mL, 85.11 % for 1.0 ng/mL, n = 6), good quantitation capacity (linear range: 0.05-1.0 ng/mL, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.9968), and low matrix effect (1.0 ng/mL, 98.25 %). It was observed that there is a significant difference (p < 0.01) of breath PPA between HPA patients and healthy volunteers. Furthermore, the detection results of breath PPA and blood Phe were compared, showing a linear correlation (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.6262) of breath PPA and blood Phe. Overall, this work provided valuable insights into breath PPA in HPA patients and showed a potential tool for noninvasive investigating of HPA."

    "title": "Indications for fetal echocardiography: consensus and controversies among evidence-based national and international guidelines.",
    "abstract": "Fetal echocardiography (FE) is an indication-driven examination for pregnant women with a fetus at high risk for congenital heart disease (CHD). Several familial, maternal and fetal factors are reported to increase the risk of CHD. The aim of this study was to highlight the existing differences in recommended indications for FE among recently published guidelines and consensuses of experts. Guidelines and expert consensuses published from January 2008 to October 2023 were identified through a systematic literature search. FE guidelines and consensus statements were excluded if not written in the English language and if indications for FE were not reported. All familial, maternal and fetal risk factors for CHD reported in the consensuses and guidelines were listed and comparisons were made between documents. The agreement or disagreement for each risk factor between guidelines and consensuses was classified as: complete agreement (all analyzed documents reported the same indication); partial agreement (all documents considered a risk factor as an indication, but with inconsistency in its definition); or complete disagreement (inconsistency between documents for the considered risk factor as an indication). Six guidelines and expert consensuses that met the inclusion criteria were identified. Overall, a total of 17 risk factors were identified as an indication for FE. Complete agreement was reached for 3/17 (17.6%) risk factors, all of which are fetal risk factors (suspected CHD at the anomaly scan, presence of major fetal extracardiac abnormality and non-immune hydrops fetalis). Partial agreement was recorded for 8/17 (47.1%) risk factors (family history of CHD, increased nuchal translucency, multiple gestation, maternal diabetes mellitus, maternal phenylketonuria, maternal infection, maternal autoimmune disease and autoantibody positivity, and teratogen exposure). Complete disagreement was recorded for 6/17 (35.3%) risk factors (inherited genetic disease associated with CHD, fetal genetic anomaly, suspected abnormality of heart rate or rhythm, first-trimester sonographic markers of CHD, abnormality of umbilical cord and venous system, and use of assisted reproductive technology). Areas of controversy regarding which CHD risk factors warrant FE were greater in quantity than were the areas of consensus. An internationally standardized agreement would be valuable for physicians and guideline developers. For many risk factors, further evidence is needed to justify their use as an indication for FE. © 2025 International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology."

    "abstract": "Studies in adults with PKU have mainly focused on the neuropsychiatric complications that may arise in individuals who are unable to maintain the recommended lifetime diet. Some recent epidemiological studies suggest to consider other complications. As such, cardiovascular (CV) issues have been the subject of few studies to date. The aim of this review is to gather and discuss data from the literature on the traditional risks of CV complications in PKU, a potential CV phenotype in this population and the various non-traditional risks and potential associated mechanisms. The reported prevalence of comorbidities suggests an increased risk of CV complications in adults with PKU, mostly in late-diagnosed patients. Studies about a specific CV phenotype associated with PKU are suggestive, although further studies are needed. The data on oxidative stress in this population are consistent and confirm an increased CV risk. Regarding other potential mechanisms, it is not possible to conclude whether adult PKU patients have low grade inflammation, dyslipidemia, kidney impairment or if they have hyperhomocysteinemia. It would be of interest to measure potential biomarker associated with CV complications, such as homocysteine, asymmetric dimethylarginine and kynurenines (quinolic acid)."

    "title": "Establishment of the isotope dilution-gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (ID-GC/MS) method for accurate quantification of phenylalanine and its application to value assignment of external quality assessment samples.",
    "abstract": "Phenylalanine (Phe) was an essential amino acid that was crucial for diagnosing phenylketonuria (PKU) and managing their blood Phe levels. Currently, there was no JCTLM-recognized reference method for measuring Phe internationally. To standardize the measurement of serum Phe, our primary goal was to establish an accurate quantitative method based on isotope dilution combined with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (ID-GC/MS) for the quantitative detection of Phe in human serum, and its performance was thoroughly validated. Serum samples were pre-treated using acetonitrile protein precipitation. After derivatization with N-(Methyl)-N-(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (MSTFA), serum Phe content was quantitatively detected using the ID-GC/MS method. Mass spectrometry analysis was conducted using the SIM monitoring mode. The analytical performance and application of the new method were investigated. External quality assessment (EQA) samples were tested using the established method, and their accuracy was compared with clinical laboratory results. The total detection time for Phe using the established method was 7 min. This method was capable of quantifying Phe within the range of 7.39 to 1188.81 μmol/L, with a limit of quantitation of 3.03 μmol/L. The intra-assay and inter-assay coefficients of variation (CV) were both ≤2.5 %, and the spike recovery rate ranged from 97.64 % to 100.72 %, and a relative expanded uncertainty was ≤3.0 % (k = 2). The method was free from interference, matrix effect and carry-over. Moreover, the ID-GC/MS measurement procedure was successfully applied to measure Phe in serum samples and to assign value of EQA samples. This study successfully established an accurate quantitative method for detecting serum Phe concentrations using ID-GC/MS technology and it could support EQA management for Phe testing, providing traceable target values for samples."

    "abstract": "In phenylketonuria, high plasma phenylalanine concentrations have been associated with cognitive impairments. Still, there are reports of patients with high plasma phenylalanine without apparent cognitive dysfunction. This suggests inter-individual differences in the extent and nature of the negative effects of elevated plasma phenylalanine. This work reports two 'unusual' female patients, of 56 and 57 years old, who were late-treated, with a diagnosis at 8 and 2 years old, but show an estimated IQ of 105. Insight into the functioning of these 'unusual' patients aids our understanding of the pathology behind phenylketonuria. Neurocognitive functioning was evaluated with the Amsterdam Neuropsychological Tasks, comparing measures of executive functions (EF; sustained attention, cognitive flexibility and working memory) and emotion recognition with 25 adult early-treated phenylketonuria patients (ET-PKU; mean 35.2 years, SD 3.3) from the COBESO-PKU database. Brain phenylalanine levels were determined with magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and compared to those of 'usual' phenylketonuria patients reported in literature. On the EF, performance was only slightly decreased (#A), or similar (#B) compared to ET-PKU, while plasma phenylalanine concentrations were 883 and 1181 μmol/L (mean ET-PKU: 687.5 μmol/L, SD 329.5). The brain-to-blood phenylalanine ratio of patient #A (0.20) was close to the expected range for 'usual' phenylketonuria patients (median 0.28, IQR 0.11), while #B showed a lower ratio (0.07). Both #A and #B have a far better outcome than expected based on their late diagnosis and dietary adherence afterwards. Although both patients had no severe neurocognitive dysfunction, slight deficits on EF and emotion regulation compared to ET-PKU cannot be ruled out. This underlines the importance of individually-tailored treatment in these patients. Interestingly, inter-individuality in the brain-to-blood phenylalanine ratio could explain the 'unusually' good outcome of patient #B, but not in patient #A. Suggesting that altered phenylalanine transport between blood and brain can explain some, but not all 'unusual' cases. Other explanations are needed and may relate to inter-individual vulnerability of the brain to elevated phenylalanine."

    "title": "Coexistence of a Leaky SCID Phenotype With Hyperphenylalaninemia in an Adult Case.",
    "abstract": "In recent years, due to the widespread use of advanced molecular diagnostic methods, it has become clear that individuals in particular born from consanguineous marriages may be carriers of different genetic diseases. For this reason, cases where diseases related to inborn errors of immunity (IEI) and metabolism errors are detected in the same patient are encountered more frequently. In patients affected by different genetic defects, the pathophysiology is more complex, and disease management is more difficult. In this article, we aimed to draw attention to this complex genetic carrier state in a male with primary immunodeficiency (PID). In the patient who presented with recurrent lower respiratory tract infections, bronchiectasis, asthma and nasal polyps, and antibody deficiencies as well as cellular immunodeficiency findings were detected in the immunological analyses. In the whole exome sequencing (WES) study, three different variants were detected, two in genes related to PIDs (DCLRE1C and TNFRSF13B) and one in the gene related to phenylalanine metabolism (phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH)). In the light of the current findings, the patient was evaluated as having leaky severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) with immune phenotype T-B-natural killer (NK)+ and hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA). This case showed us that metabolic diseases may accompany a delay in the diagnosis of SCID and patients should be evaluated with a multidisciplinary approach."

    "abstract": "<b>Background/Objectives:</b> Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a rare inherited metabolic disorder caused by phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency, resulting in highly elevated blood phenylalanine (Phe) concentrations, leading to neurotoxic effects. Despite advancements in treatment, adult patients with PKU may experience impairments in executive functions (EFs). This study investigates the influence of metabolic control across different life stages on EFs and sociodemographic outcomes in adult PKU. <b>Methods:</b> We conducted a monocentric study with 36 early-diagnosed and treated PKU patients (mean age: 34.8 years). EFs were assessed using the Test Battery for Attentional Performance (TAP) and the Tower of London (TL-D). Metabolic data were extracted from medical records, focusing on childhood and adulthood metabolic control, including Phe fluctuations. Sociodemographic data were collected via questionnaires. Statistical analyses explored relationships between EFs, metabolic control, and sociodemographic data. <b>Results:</b> EFs in the cohort were within the lower average range. Significant negative correlations could be observed between EF performance and dried blood Phe concentrations during childhood (ages 0-10 years) as well as current Phe concentrations and Phe variation. Elevated childhood Phe concentrations were associated with lower educational attainment. Sociodemographic characteristics, such as employment status and living arrangements, aligned with those of the general population. <b>Conclusions:</b> Optimal cognitive development in PKU requires good metabolic control, particularly in early childhood. In adulthood, while dietary restrictions may be relaxed, maintaining low and stable Phe concentrations is crucial for EFs. Consistent monitoring and tailored therapeutic approaches throughout life seem essential for optimizing metabolic and neurocognitive outcome in PKU."

    "abstract": "Newborn screening for Phenylketonuria enables early detection and timely treatment with a phenylalanine-restricted diet to prevent severe neurological impairment. Although effective and in use for 60 years, screening, diagnostic, and treatment practices still vary widely across countries and centers. To evaluate the Phenylketonuria newborn screening practices internationally, we designed a survey with questions focusing on the laboratory aspect of the screening system. We analyzed 24 completed surveys from 23 countries. Most participants used the same sampling age range of 48-72 h; they used tandem mass spectrometry and commercial non-derivatized kits to measure phenylalanine (Phe), and had non-negative cut-off values (COV) set mostly at 120 µmol/L of Phe. Participants mostly used genetic analysis of blood and detailed amino acid analysis from blood plasma as their confirmatory methods and set the COV for the initiation of dietary therapy at 360 µmol/L of Phe. There were striking differences in practice as well. While most participants reported a 48-72 h range for age at sampling, that range was overall quite diverse Screening COV varied as well. Additional screening parameters, e.g., the phenylalanine/tyrosine ratio were used by some participants to determine the screening result. Some participants included testing for tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency, or galactosemia in their diagnostic process. Results together showed that there is room to select a best practice from the many practices applied. Such a best practice of PKU-NBS parameters and post-screening parameters could then serve as a generally applicable guideline."

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an inborn error of metabolism responsible for an accumulation of phenylalanine, which leads to cognitive and developmental disorders if left untreated. Most studies of adult PKU focus on neuropsychiatric complications, but new questions have been raised about systemic manifestations of PKU in adulthood. Fifteen adults with classic PKU with poor metabolic control and 15 matched healthy controls were recruited to compare their blood metabolomes by an untargeted multimodal approach (polar, apolar, and lipids) by LC/MS and a targeted approach to the tryptophan pathway. Targeted analysis revealed systemic serotonin hypometabolism and aberrant kynurenine metabolism, as well as potential implication of microbiota by differences in some indole compounds compared to controls. Untargeted analysis confirms previous findings regarding the TCA cycle, alanine aspartate glutamate metabolism, arginine and proline metabolism, and revealed some new metabolic perturbations such as arginine biosynthesis or glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism. Future studies involving larger numbers of patients with varying degrees of metabolic control are needed to confirm these findings."

This report discusses a 10-year-old male initially misdiagnosed with FIRES, whose refractory seizures and encephalopathy prompted further genetic investigation. Whole-exome sequencing revealed compound heterozygous mutations in the PAH gene, confirming late-diagnosed PKU. The presence of pathogenic mutations in distinct locations within the PAH gene suggests the patient is a compound heterozygote, confirming a rare, late-diagnosed case of PKU. The case emphasizes that untreated PKU can result in toxic phenylalanine accumulation, leading to profound neuropsychiatric and cognitive impairments, which can be mitigated with early dietary intervention and lifelong management strategies."

Similar alterations are expected in the peripheral biogenic amines (PBA), which share the same metabolic pathway with the brain. The present cross-sectional study explored the potential prognostic value of PBA by examining their relationship with blood Phe and clinical outcomes in early-treated adult PKU patients (ETPKU). 53 ETPKU (age 27.14 ± 8.22 years; 35 female) and 60 age-matched control subjects (age 43 ± 13 years; 43 female) were enrolled in the study. A UPLC-ESI-MS/MS-based method was developed to assess 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), serotonin (5-HT), 5-hydroxyhyndolacetic acid (5-HIAA), and 3-O-methyldopa (3-OMD) in different blood-derived matrices. Life-long Index of Dietary Control (IDC), concurrent Phe, and Tyr were other parameters included in the analysis. Clinical outcome measures included IQ, executive functions (BRIEF), and psychiatric morbidity (CBCL/ASR and DSM-5-TR). 5-HTP, 5-HIAA, and 3-OMD were significantly lower in PKU patients than in controls. 5-HIAA and 3-OMD were negatively correlated with concurrent Phe levels. Concerning outcome measures, IDC influenced IQ and BRIEF-Shift subscale, 5-HIAA BRIEF-Emotional Control, 3-OMD BRIEF-Initiate subscale, and Tyr BRIEF-Control subscale. In contrast, concurrent plasma Phe did not affect any outcome measures. While confirming the negative influence of Phe on PBA in adult ETPKU, mimicking what happens in the brain, we also found an effect of PBA depletion on clinical outcome measures independent of Phe level. This suggests that PBA could serve as new candidate biomarkers for treatment monitoring in adult ETPKU patients."

    "abstract": "Monitoring patients with phenylketonuria (PKU) requires accurately measuring phenylalanine and tyrosine levels in a small volume of blood samples obtained by the dried blood spot (DBS) technique. The aim was to study selected parameters influencing the quantitative results. Phenylalanine and tyrosine were extracted from DBS samples with methanol, and 5 internal standard introduction techniques were tested. Phenylalanine and tyrosine levels were measured in 6-mm discs punched from DBS, pre-punched 9-mm discs containing the entire DBS sample, and liquid blood by HPLC-MS-MS. Levels in 6-mm discs punched from DBS measured by HPLC-MS/MS were compared with those measured by the HPLC-FLD. The analytical parameters of the method are satisfactory, linearity in the range of 25-1200 μmol/L (LOD, LOQ and LLOQ values 0.2 μmol/L, 0.5 μmol/L and 3.8 μmol/L for phenylalanine, 0.5 μmol/L, 1.5 μmol/L and 5.1 μmol/L for tyrosine), within-run precision 1.8 %-3.7 % for phenylalanine, 1.9 %-2.7 % for tyrosine, between-run precision 4.7 %-5.9 % for phenylalanine, 4.1 %-5.4 % for tyrosine, recovery 93.8 %-100.4 % for phenylalanine and 93.7 %-99.1 % for tyrosine.

    "abstract": "Many publications describe experiences of healthcare professionals (HCPs) on managing phenylketonuria (PKU), but literature on the perspectives of individuals with PKU is limited. Nevertheless, patient insights and strategies to address challenges of living with PKU can provide guidance to HCPs and the PKU community to further optimise PKU care. A virtual meeting was held to elucidate the lived experience of patients with PKU and brainstorm best practice recommendations from the patient perspective. The meeting was moderated by a psychologist and attended by seven adults with PKU and one caregiver. Based on the outcomes of this meeting and subsequent online rating rounds, consensus statements (≥75 % agreement) reflecting patient focused considerations were developed using a modified Delphi approach. Consensus was reached for 18 statements on five topics: the PKU diet, experience with HCPs throughout life, impact of PKU on everyday life, connecting with the PKU community, and future aspirations to facilitate life with PKU.To minimise the burden of diet, avoidance of hunger and offering new treatment options were identified, together with adequate education and support. Maintaining metabolic control throughout adulthood could be facilitated by easier access to clinics beyond in-person visits and by availability of treatment teams specifically equipped to provide PKU-adult care. To further support adults in reaching target blood Phe concentrations and personal goals, pegvaliase can be offered to those eligible. Finally, exchanging experiences with others from the PKU community through social media and live/virtual meetings may help individuals with PKU and caregivers to improve their knowledge and skills to manage PKU. These consensus statements provide unique insights on how challenges faced by individuals with PKU may be addressed and may provide guidance to HCPs as well as the PKU community and caregivers on ways to improve patient care and support."

A review of 51 PKU patients initiated on pegvaliase at the PKU clinic of M Health Fairview, Minneapolis, MN, between May 2018 and May 2024 was conducted. Data collected included baseline characteristics, payer authorization outcomes, treatment history, phenylalanine (Phe) levels, adverse events, and management strategies. At 12-months, 55% of patients achieved Phe goal (360 μmol/L), increasing to 77% at 24 months. Among patients on maintenance doses, 87% achieved ≥20% Phe reduction at 12 months, rising to 93.5% at 24 months. Combination therapy with sapropterin and pegvaliase was associated with faster Phe goal attainment compared with pegvaliase monotherapy (P = .0599). Anaphylaxis occurred in 31% of patients, predominantly during the maintenance phase. All patients successfully initiated therapy without access barriers, although 35% required appeals for insurance approval. Common adverse events included injection site reactions (90%) and arthralgia (69%). Special populations, including 1 adolescent and 2 pregnant women, were safely managed on pegvaliase. Pegvaliase effectively reduced Phe levels in PKU patients, although it carried significant risks of anaphylaxis and other adverse events. A pharmacist-led program and interdisciplinary collaboration was crucial for prompt access and effective management."

    "abstract": "In 2013, it was discovered that a subset of the population in Ronneby, Sweden was exposed to high levels of perfluorinated compounds (PFAS) from drinking water that had been provided by the local Brantafors waterworks and was contaminated by fire-fighting foam from a nearby airport. The start and time-course of population exposures are not known. To investigate the start of PFAS exposures in the Ronneby population and changes over time by measuring PFAS in dried blood spots (DBS) collected from infants after birth and biobanked at the Swedish Phenylketonuria (PKU) Biobank. We measured PFAS in DBS from 288 infants born between 1985 and 2013 using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Brantafors subjects (N = 246) were infants whose mothers lived at an address that received Brantafors water, while non-Brantafors subjects (N = 42) were infants whose mothers lived in the same county but never lived in Ronneby. We compared PFAS concentrations between the two groups using Welch's t-tests for unequal variance and investigated trends in PFAS concentration over time using generalized additive models with a non-linear term for year of birth. Mean PFAS concentrations were significantly higher in Brantafors subjects born in 1985 (N = 10) compared to non-Brantafors subjects born 1985-1989 (N = 19) for all PFAS. The concentration of all PFAS measured in Brantafors subjects increased from 1985, with most PFAS reaching an expected maximum in 2007. For example, non-Brantafors subjects born between 1985 and 1995 had a median PFOS concentration of 4.0 ng/mL (IQR: 3.6-4.3), while Brantafors subjects born 1985-1995 had a median concentration of 18 ng/mL (IQR: 14-26) and Brantafors subjects born 1996-2013 had a median concentration of 42 ng/mL (IQR: 29-64). These results suggest that population-wide PFAS exposures were already present in Ronneby in 1985 and increased over the subsequent 30 years, and demonstrate how DBS can be used for historical exposure assessment."

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a rare, hereditary disease that causes disruption in phenylalanine (Phe) metabolism. Despite early intervention, individuals with PKU may have difficulty in several different cognitive domains, including verbal fluency, processing speed, and executive functioning. The overarching goal of this study is to characterize the relationships among cognition, speech, mood, and blood-based biomarkers (Phe, tyrosine) in individuals with early treated PKU. We describe our initial optimization pilot results that are guiding this study while establishing the feasibility and reliability of using ecological momentary assessment (EMA) in this clinical population. In total, 20 adults with PKU were enrolled in this study between December 2022 and March 2023 through the National PKU Alliance. Of the total, 18 participants completed an extended baseline assessment followed by 6 EMAs over 1 month. The EMAs included digital cognitive tests measuring processing speed, sustained attention, and executive functioning, as well as speech (semantic fluency) and mood measures. Participants had 60 minutes to complete the assessment. Completion rates of EMAs were above 70% (on average 4.78 out of 6 EMAs), with stable performances across baseline measures and EMAs. Between-person reliability (BPR) of the EMAs, representing the variance due to differences between individuals versus within individuals, is satisfactory with values close to (semantic fluency BPR: 0.7, sustained attention BPR: 0.72) or exceeding (processing speed: 0.93, executive functioning: 0.88) data collected from a large normative database (n=5039-10,703), as well as slightly below or matching a previous study using a clinical group (n=18). As applicable, within-person reliability was also computed; we demonstrated strong reliability for processing speed (0.87). A control analysis ensured that time of day (ie, morning, afternoon, and evening) did not impact performance; performance on tasks did not decrease if tested earlier versus later in the day (all P values >.09). Similarly, to assess variability in task performance over the course of all EMAs, the coefficient of variability was computed; 28% for the task measuring sustained attention, 37% for semantic fluency, 15.8% for the task measuring executive functioning, and 17.6% for processing speed. Performance appears more stable in tasks measuring processing speed and executive functioning than on tasks of sustained attention and semantic fluency. Preliminary results of this study demonstrate strong reliability of cognitive EMA, indicating that EMA is a promising tool for evaluating fluctuations in cognitive status in this population. Future work should refine and expand the utility of these digital tools, determine how variable EMA frequencies might better characterize changes in functioning as they relate to blood-based biomarkers, and validate a singular battery that could be rapidly administered at scale and in clinical trials to determine the progression of disease."

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder characterized as deficiencies in phenylalanine hydroxylase, leading to neurotoxic effects and neurodevelopmental challenges. Sleep, crucial for cognitive and behavioral development, remains underexplored in PKU populations. This study evaluates sleep characteristics and influencing factors in school-aged children with PKU compared to those with hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA) and healthy controls. A total of 101 children aged 5-10 years participated: 37 with PKU, 31 with HPA, and 33 healthy controls. Sleep quality and disturbances were assessed using the Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ) and parent-reported data. Additional factors, including phenylalanine levels and sleep hygiene practices, were analyzed. Despite no significant differences in total CSHQ scores across groups, children with PKU exhibited unique patterns, such as being less likely to awaken by himself or herself. Phenylalanine levels showed no significant correlations with overall sleep characteristics, except for an association with reduced sleep anxiety. Distinct sleep hygiene influences emerged in the HPA and control groups, while no such relationships were observed in PKU. This study underscores the complexity of sleep disturbances in PKU, highlighting the need for future research integrating biological, behavioral, and environmental factors. Identifying determinants of sleep problems will aid in developing tailored interventions to enhance the quality of life for patients with PKU. What is known: • Children with PKU, in addition to the risks associated with chronic illness, may be more susceptible to sleep disturbances due to metabolic and neurochemical imbalances. • Prior studies on PKU and sleep have mainly focused on adult populations, with limited data available for school-aged children. What is new: • The sleep characteristics of PKU, HPA, and healthy controls were generally similar, except for awakening by themselves. • Distinct sleep hygiene influences were identified in the HPA and control groups, while no such associations were observed in the PKU group, highlighting the need for a broader perspective to explore alternative biological, behavioral, and environmental factors affecting sleep regulation in PKU."

    "title": "Protein intake and prevalence of overweight in patients with phenylketonuria: A 10-year longitudinal study.",
    "abstract": "Overweight has been identified as a comorbidity associated with phenylketonuria (PKU). A systematic review with meta-analysis found that although patients with PKU had a similar body mass index (BMI) when compared to non-PKU controls, there was a significantly higher BMI when measured in patients described as having classical PKU. The aim of this retrospective longitudinal study was to identify the prevalence of overweight in patients with PKU, over 10 years, in a Portuguese Reference Centre, following a phenylalanine-restricted diet. Inclusion criteria were diagnosis of PKU and completion of an annual nutritional status evaluation every 2 years. Information on anthropometry, dietary intake and blood phenylalanine levels was collected. The sample consisted of 94 patients (aged 14.0 ± 7.8y, 46 females). Over the study period, there was a non-statistically significant trend towards an increase in the prevalence of overweight (24.5 vs 33.0 %), as defined by age-appropriate BMI. When compared with normal-weight patients, overweight patients had significantly higher blood phenylalanine levels in the first and fifth biennium. Total and natural protein intake were significantly higher in normal-weight patients, at all timepoints, compared to overweight patients. Univariate analysis showed that a higher protein intake, particularly of natural protein, is a protective factor against the development of overweight. This result remained after adjusting total protein intake for age, gender, and metabolic control. This study found a trend towards an increase in the prevalence of overweight in patients with PKU. Therefore, the nutritional status of patients with PKU should be regularly monitored, supported by preventive and attentive nutritional support."

    "abstract": "Improvement of early diagnosis and treatment in patients with Phenylketonuria (PKU) allowed for healthy survival into adulthood of these patients, but non-neurological health impairments of unknown etiology emerged. One of these is impaired bone health that manifests in adolescence and adulthood, potentially depending not only on treatment adherence but also on additional lifestyle factors and nutrition. Eighteen adults with PKU (18.3-51.6 years, ♀ n = 11) and 19 age- and gender-matched controls (18.3-54.9 years, ♀ n = 10) participated in the study. Bone metabolism-related parameters (BMRPs) in plasma, serum, and urine were analyzed. Dietary habits and lifestyle factors were obtained from questionnaires; a 6-min walk test and a dual X-ray absorptiometry measurement at two sites were performed. Phenylalanine (Phe) serum concentrations from the 5 years prior to study participation were collected from the patients' charts. Patients had reduced bone mineral density (BMD) T-score in hips (-0.67 ± 1.05) and lumbar spine (-0.71 ± 1.11, both p = 0.018). Most BMRPs in plasma, serum, and urine, as well as markers of oxidative stress did not differ from healthy controls. Whereas 89% of adults with PKU were vitamin D-sufficient, only 68% of controls reached vitamin D sufficiency. 25-Hydroxy vitamin D concentration was significantly higher in adults with PKU than that in controls [33.1 ng/mL (26.2-40.3) vs. 23.4 ng/mL (17.2-24.9); p < 0.001], whereas parathyroid hormone concentrations showed no difference [PKU: 27.6 pg/mL (19.6-42.8) vs. Co: 36.1 pg/mL (29.2-40.8); p = 0.089]. Neither Phe blood concentration nor dietary habits or lifestyle factors were associated with BMD in regression analysis. Neither dietary habits nor lifestyle factors showed an association with BMD in this group of adults with PKU, whereas BMD was reduced."

    "title": "Implementing and validating newborn screening for inborn errors of metabolism in South India: a 2-year observational study at a tertiary care hospital.",
    "abstract": "Newborn screening (NBS) is an essential public health initiative for early diagnosis of inborn errors of metabolism (IEM), where timely intervention can reduce morbidity and mortality. While routine in developed countries, NBS is not widely practised in India. This study aimed to implement NBS programme in a tertiary care hospital in South India and validate predetermined cut-off values tailored to the regional population. Between 2020 and 2022, 5157 neonates were screened for congenital hypothyroidism (CH), congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), cystic fibrosis (CF), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency (G6PDD), phenylketonuria (PKU), galactosemia and biotinidase deficiency. Screening was performed using dissociation-enhanced lanthanide fluorescent immunoassay technology on Victor2D platform (Revvity). Markers assessed included 17-α-OH progesterone, neonatal thyroid stimulating hormone, total galactose, immunoreactive trypsinogen, G6PD enzyme, biotinidase enzyme and phenylalanine levels. Data analysis was conducted using R V.4.1.1 software. Of the 5157 neonates, the recall rates were consistent with those reported in similar studies. However, only 26.7% of screen-positive newborns returned for retesting, indicating a significant gap in awareness about IEMs and the importance of follow-up. Of these, none were diagnosed with CAH; however, four were found to have CH, two had galactosemia, three had G6PDD, one had CF, one had PKU and none had biotinidase deficiency. The confirmed cases were promptly treated and monitored regularly. The distribution of each marker's values fell within 2.5th-97.5th percentiles suggesting consistency. The reference ranges provided by the manufacturer appear valid in the Indian context. A key challenge identified was low follow-up compliance for screen-positive infants, highlighting the need for enhanced public education on IEM and NBS. Future research will focus on determining the incidence of IEMs and improving parental awareness and follow-up rates."

    "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> Phenylketonuria (PKU) poses significant challenges for maternal and neonatal outcomes, requiring strict adherence to dietary protocols to maintain optimal maternal phenylalanine (Phe) levels during pregnancy. This study retrospectively analyzed outcomes of pregnancies in PKU-affected women and conducted a systematic review on the timing of dietary management and its impact on outcomes. <b>Methods:</b> This retrospective study included data from nine PKU-affected women and 14 pregnancies followed at the Regional Reference Center for Metabolic Diseases in Catania. Women were categorized based on the timing of dietary intervention: preconception (pcD), during pregnancy (pD), or never (nD). Maternal Phe levels were classified as in-target (tP+) or non-target (tP-). A systematic review of the literature was conducted using PRISMA methodology, including 77 studies reporting maternal Phe levels, dietary timing, and clinical/auxological offspring outcomes. <b>Results:</b> In the retrospective study, pcD and tP+ groups had significantly better neonatal outcomes, with lower rates of congenital heart disease (CHD), facial dysmorphisms, intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), and microcephaly. Systematic review data from 1068 PKU-affected women and 2094 pregnancies revealed that pcD with tP+ resulted in the lowest rates of miscarriage (0.14%) and adverse neonatal outcomes, while tP- and nD groups showed the highest rates of CHD, microcephaly, and intellectual disability. <b>Conclusions:</b> Early dietary intervention, ideally preconceptionally, and achieving target maternal Phe levels are critical in reducing adverse outcomes in pregnancies of PKU-affected women. These findings emphasize the importance of metabolic control and adherence to dietary protocols in maternal PKU management."

    "title": "Maternal Phenylketonuria: Consequences of Dietary Non-Adherence and Gaps in Preconception Care-A Case Report.",
    "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> Maternal phenylketonuria (PKU), a metabolic disorder caused by defective phenylalanine hydroxylase activity, requires strict lifelong dietary management to prevent toxic phenylalanine accumulation. During pregnancy, non-adherence to a low-phenylalanine diet can lead to maternal PKU syndrome, resulting in severe neonatal complications, including microcephaly, congenital heart defects, and growth restrictions. Despite advances in metabolic management and preconception care guidelines, adherence remains a significant challenge, particularly among adults transitioning out of pediatric care. This case report examines the clinical consequences of dietary non-adherence in maternal PKU, highlighting the importance of preconception education, metabolic monitoring, and multidisciplinary care in preventing adverse neonatal outcomes. <b>Methods:</b> Using the CARE guidelines, we present the clinical course of a male neonate born to a mother with untreated PKU. <b>Results:</b> The analysis incorporates maternal dietary history, prenatal care details, and neonatal outcomes. Additionally, a review of current literature on maternal PKU management and outcomes contextualizes the findings. The neonate, delivered at 38 weeks via cesarean section, exhibited low birth weight (2150 g), severe microcephaly (head circumference: 28 cm), microphthalmia, and septal heart defects. Maternal dietary non-adherence, beginning in late adolescence, contributed to significantly elevated phenylalanine levels during pregnancy (>20 mg/dL). Prenatal care was initiated in the 23rd week of gestation, delaying dietary intervention. The mother reported limited understanding of the teratogenic risks associated with poor dietary control, which was compounded by gaps in preconception counseling and care continuity. <b>Conclusions:</b> This case underscores the critical need for comprehensive preconception education and lifelong metabolic management for women with PKU. Early and sustained dietary adherence is essential to mitigate neonatal risks. Public health initiatives should prioritize access to preconception care, enhance patient education, and establish robust multidisciplinary support systems to optimize maternal and neonatal outcomes. Addressing barriers such as delayed care initiation and limited dietary support can significantly reduce the burden of maternal PKU syndrome."

    "title": "Current Insights into Nutritional Management of Phenylketonuria: An Update for Children and Adolescents.",
    "abstract": "Considering the fact that even today in the 21st century, diet is the basis of the treatment in phenylketonuria (PKU), this review aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of existing current data from the last 15 years on dietary treatment and its impact on nutritional status and quality of life to identify gaps in knowledge and offer insights into future directions for optimizing nutritional care in PKU. Dietary treatment for PKU has evolved over the years, and in order to optimize and standardize the care, European PKU experts developed guidelines useful for both professionals and patients and their parents. The current literature underscores the essential role of diet in both managing PKU and preventing obesity, but malnutrition in these children is a complex issue that necessitates a multifaceted approach. The literature emphasizes the crucial role of dietary adherence in managing PKU. Advancements in therapy offer the potential to reduce the challenges associated with dietary phenylalanine (Phe) restrictions. Maintaining adequate levels of essential nutrients in children with PKU and monitoring trace element intake and micronutrient levels are vital for preventing deficiencies and ensuring optimal growth and development. Overall, the literature highlights the importance of personalized treatment strategies. Conclusions. Effective management of PKU necessitates strict dietary control and personalized treatment to maintain optimal blood Phe levels. Continuous monito-ring, nutritional education, and adherence to dietary recommendations are critical components in achieving the best patient outcomes. Future studies should also explore innovative therapeutic modalities, including gene therapy and novel dietary strategies that consider the gut-brain axis, to enhance the quality of life and mental health for individuals with PKU."

    "title": "Development of an SI traceable value assigned amino acid matrix-matched material to underpin European external quality assessment.",
    "abstract": "Plasma amino acid analysis plays a vital role in monitoring inherited metabolic diseases (IMDs), such as phenylketonuria (PKU), where dietary therapy is the cornerstone of management and patients are regularly monitored using blood or plasma phenylalanine throughout life. Recent findings from external quality assessment (EQA) schemes demonstrate large variability between results from different clinical laboratories. EQA schemes are hampered by factors including suboptimal sample type and frequency of distributions. Aiming to harmonise and standardise EQA schemes, this paper describes value assignment of an SI traceable matrix-matched amino acid material, and its use in an interlaboratory comparison (ERNDIM QAA-2106 study) that included 89 clinical laboratories from throughout Europe. The outcomes of the interlaboratory comparison are valuable in enabling clinical laboratories to refine their methodologies and, in a longer term, will lead to enhanced accuracy of results in clinical measurements and, ultimately, improved patient care in IMD management. A frozen, pooled human plasma sample was distributed to participating laboratories (n = 88). The sample was value assigned for phenylalanine by the National Measurement Laboratory (NML) traceable to the international system of units (SI), at approximately the target value for dietary monitoring of phenylketonuria (360 µmol/L). Participants used their routine method of analysis to measure 24 amino acids in triplicate and results were compared against desirable analytical performance. Mean intra- and inter-laboratory variability were acceptable for 20/20 and 19/20 amino acids respectively. Mean bias relative to the consensus values was acceptable for 17/20 amino acids. Overall performance of phenylalanine was acceptable; however, 15/87 laboratories failed to meet acceptable imprecision and 8/87 had unacceptable bias; additionally, an overall negative bias for phenylalanine measurement was identified. This study demonstrates the importance of ensuring a matrix material with an assigned value of the analyte(s) of interest (traceable to the SI) is available for regular EQA. The significant bias in the routine measurement of phenylalanine identified has the potential to impact disease management, which aims to control blood phenylalanine concentrations for preventing adverse neurological outcomes."

In particular, PAL derived from Anabaena variabilis (AvPAL) has been successfully utilized in clinical settings as an enzyme replacement therapy for phenylketonuria (PKU). Nonetheless, enhancing the catalytic efficiency of enzymes continues to be a formidable task. Herein, a deep learning-guided strategy was employed to identify potential sites in AvPAL that require modification to address current challenges. In conjunction with high-throughput screening and enzymatic assays, 26 out of 33 mutants were validated to exhibit enhanced activity. Notably, the probability of identifying mutants with increased activity at each targeted site was 100 %. Through multiple rounds of combinatorial mutagenesis, the catalytic efficiency (k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>M</sub>) was improved up to 3.4-fold (M222N/N36S) and the activity was enhanced up to 2.4-fold (M222N/I149D) compared to the wild type. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that the stabilization of the proximate attack conformation is closely associated with the enhancement of catalytic activity. Furthermore, structural superposition, residue interaction network analysis, and dynamic cross-correlation matrices indicate that the most active mutant, M222N/I149D, induces local fluctuations and distal effects in loop 81-94, leading to a more favorable conformation and thus increased activity. Collectively, this study provides a feasible approach for engineering an efficient PAL."

This pilot study assessed the stepwise transition from second to third-stage protein substitutes in children with PKU, aged 3-5 years. Demographics, child behavior, maternal anxiety, and food neophobia scores were collected at baseline, mid-transition, and final assessment. Blood phenylalanine (Phe) was collected from 6 months pre-baseline to post-final assessment. Twelve children (<i>n</i> = 4 males, 33%, median age 3.2 years) participated. Sixty-seven percent (<i>n</i> = 8) transitioned to liquid amino acid-based protein substitute and 33% (<i>n</i> = 4) to glycomacropeptide (cGMP) powder. Forty-two percent (<i>n</i> = 5/12) had a smooth transition (Group 1, median 3.5 months), while the remaining faced difficulty (<i>n</i> = 3, 25%, Group 2), or failed full transition (<i>n</i> = 4, 33%, Group 3). In Groups 2 and 3, caregivers failed to follow instructions, demonstrating inconsistencies and child resistance. Group 2 children had significantly higher blood Phe levels (above 360 μmol/L), that was significantly higher than Groups 1 and 3 (<i>p</i> < 0.01), with Groups 1 and 3 maintaining blood Phe within target (<i>p</i> < 0.01). Higher maternal education and nursery/school attendance significantly influenced transition success (<i>p</i> < 0.05). No significant differences were found in child neophobia, maternal anxiety, or child behavior (<i>p</i> > 0.05). Mothers generally reported satisfaction with the stepwise transition process. A stepwise transition to third-stage protein substitutes in PKU is effective, but is dependent on child metabolic control, parental education, and nursery/school support."

As a possible therapeutic strategy for PKU, we introduce a nanocarbon system passivated with polyphenol gallic acid (CNPGA), which has the ability to disrupt and inhibit the formation of fibrillar assemblies. The CNPGA was prepared using a rapid and facile microwave-assisted one-pot method from an aqueous solution of sucrose and gallic acid and fully characterized using UV-Vis, FT-IR, XRD, XPS, TEM, zeta potential and DLS measurements. The CNPGA-mediated inhibition and disruption of L-phenylalanine fibrils was examined using a thioflavin T (ThT) assay. The change in the conformation of the fibrils upon CNPGA treatment was assessed by means of circular dichroism spectroscopy. Visual analysis of the rupture of fibrillar assemblies was performed using SEM. Finally, the biocompatibility of CNPGA was evaluated in two normal cell lines, HaCaT (human epidermal keratinocyte cell line) and Vero (African green monkey kidney cell line) cells."

Problems with patients/caregivers included not ordering LPPF in a timely way (81%), not responding to messages from home delivery companies (73%) and poor understanding of the ordering process (70%). The majority (93%) of respondents reported that prescription issues impacted their patients' blood Phe control. Suggestions for improving access to LPPF included centralisation of the system to one supplier (76%) and apps for ordering LPPF (69%). The supply of LPPF for PKU in the UK is problematic; it may adversely affect the ability of patients to adhere to dietary management, and a review investigating patient access to LPPF is urgently required."

Early diagnosis through newborn screening (NBS) enables prompt treatment, preventing neurological complications. This study aims to describe the genetic and phenotypic spectrum of PKU and mild hyperphenylalaninemia (m-HPA) in patients diagnosed at the Department of Inborn Errors of Metabolism and Newborn Screening, Hospital G. Rodolico-S. Marco, Catania, over four decades (1987-2023). <b>Materials and Methods</b>: The retrospective analysis included 102 patients with elevated blood phenylalanine (Phe) levels born in Sicily and followed at the Institute. The phenotype evaluation comprised the Phe levels at birth/diagnosis, dietary tolerance, and sapropterin dihydrochloride responsiveness. The dietary compliance and Phe/Tyr ratios were assessed and compared across phenotypic classes and age groups. <b>Results</b>: Of 102 patients, 34 were classified as having classic PKU, 9 as having moderate PKU, 26 as having mild PKU, and 33 as having m-HPA, with a median age of 21.72 years. Common PAH variants included c.1066-11G>A (26/204 alleles), c.782G>A (18/204 alleles), and c.165delT (13/204 alleles). The phenotypes sometimes diverged from the genotype predictions, emphasizing dietary tolerance over the initial Phe levels for classification: m-HPA was statistically associated with a higher dietary tolerance (<i>p</i> < 0.001) compared to the classic, moderate, or mild forms of PKU. <b>Conclusions</b>: This study highlights the importance of large databases (e.g., BioPKU) for phenotype prediction and treatment optimization. Regular assessment of Phe/Tyr ratios is crucial for monitoring adherence and health. Phenotype determination, dietary management, and emerging therapies (Pegvaliase and gene therapy) are key to improving outcomes for PKU patients."

    "title": "Impaired cognitive function and decreased monoamine neurotransmitters in the DNAJC12 gene knockout mouse model.",
    "abstract": "Hyperphenylalaninemia, a prevalent amino acid metabolism disorder, often results in cognitive impairment. Recent studies have identified a rare variant of this disorder caused by mutations in the DNAJC12 gene. The specific mechanisms by which DNAJC12 mutations lead to hyperphenylalaninemia and the lack of an animal model for study remain significant gaps in understanding. This study aims to elucidate the role of DNAJC12 in intellectual disability and explore the mechanisms by which DNAJC12 deficiency leads to hyperphenylalaninemia through developing a DNAJC12 gene knockout mouse model. We thoroughly examined the clinical features and genetic mutations evident in two patients with biallelic mutations in the DNAJC12 gene. Based on the patient's mutation locations, we determined the target site for the knockout utilizing CRISPR/Cas9 technology. To assess the impact of these mutations on DNAJC12 expression, we used quantitative real-time PCR and Western blotting techniques to measure mRNA and protein levels, respectively. The Morris water maze test was administered to evaluate the cognitive functions of the mice. Additionally, we utilized High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) to measure serum aromatic amino acids and brain monoamines, facilitating an investigation into the metabolism of phenylalanine and tyrosine. We reported two patients with mutations in the DNAJC12 gene. Case 1 carried the mutations c.158-1G > A and c.262 C > T in the DNAJC12 gene. He presented with nocturnal eye closure, crying, and arching back in reverse tension before treatment, suggesting a neurotransmitter metabolism disorder. Case 2 carried the mutations c.473 C > G, and c.102 deletion in the DNAJC12 gene. He showed elevated blood phenylalanine levels, although further clinical details were not available. Based on the patients' mutation locations, exons 2-4 of the DNAJC12 gene were targeted and eliminated. In our animal model experiments, DNAJC12 gene knockout mice exhibited a complete absence of DNAJC12 expression at both mRNA and protein levels. These knockout mice showed significant deficits in learning and memory performance as assessed by the Morris water maze test. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis indicated no significant differences in the levels of aromatic amino hydroxylases between knockout and wild-type mice. However, Western blot analysis revealed a substantial reduction in phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) protein levels in the liver of knockout mice, while tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH2) expression remained unchanged. HPLC analysis demonstrated increased serum Phe concentrations and decreased levels of brain neurotransmitters in the knockout group. We report two patients with four novel DNAJC12 mutations (c.158-1G > A, c.262 C > T, c.473 C > G, c.102delT), expanding the mutation spectrum. Based on the patients' mutation location, we established the first DNAJC12 gene knockout mouse model. The knockout mice exhibit hyperphenylalaninemia, impaired cognitive function, and decreased monoamine neurotransmitters. DNAJC12 deficiency may contribute to the clinical phenotype via the PAH pathway, potentially at the post-transcriptional level."

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) treatment requires a low-phenylalanine (Phe) diet limiting natural protein intake, using medical low-protein foods and Phe-free amino acids (AA) supplements along with micronutriments' supplies. Current recommendations suggest maintaining this diet for life to prevent neuro-psychological effects of high Phe concentrations. The long-term consequences of such a diet are poorly understood, particularly on bone health. Our study aimed to assess the prevalence of low bone mineral density (BMD) (Z-score ≤ -2, for vertebral and/or femoral site) in adults with PKU and to investigate associated risk factors, in the French ECOPHEN cohort. The study included 171 patients with 67.3 % of women and a median age of 27 years old. The median femoral and vertebral Z-scores of BMD were both - 0.6. Only 11.4 % of patients had a low BMD. Compared to patients with normal BMD, patients with low BMD had a lower body mass index (BMI) (median 20.4 versus 24.4 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, p = 0.002), and were more likely to have never stopped their diet (58.8 % versus 31.8 %, p = 0.029). They also had higher total protein intake (1.1 versus 0.9 g/kg/day, p = 0.015), with more proteins from AA supplements (0.80 vs 0.53 g/kg/day, p = 0.010). In multivariate analysis, younger patients born after 1990 and who never stopped diet had a 4.7 times risk to have low BMD (p = 0.005), after adjustment on age, sex, BMI. In summary, our study identified a subgroup of PKU adult patients with low BMD and showed that prolonged low natural protein diet is associated with low BMD."

    "title": "The Frequencies of Different Inborn Errors of Metabolism in Adult Metabolic Centres: 10 Years Later, Another Report From the SSIEM Adult Metabolic Physicians Group.",
    "abstract": "There are still few centres, which specialise in the care of adults with inborn errors of metabolism (IEM). All physicians who participated in the SSIEM adult metabolic physicians group paper in 2014 were contacted to provide updated data on their IEM patients. Fifteen adult centres responded to our survey with information on their patients. Nine thousand, six hundred fifty-one patients were included in the final cohort, compared with 6 182 in the previous analysis. There were 394 separate diagnoses. The most common diseases were phenylketonuria (19.6%), mitochondrial disorders (12.3%) and lysosomal storage disorders such as Fabry disease (20.1% of LSD's), Pompe disease (3.1%), and Gaucher disease (2.8%). Among the disorders that can present with acute metabolic decompensation, the urea cycle disorders (4.0%), were most common (ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency 2.6%), followed by maple syrup urine disease (1.1%) and glycogen storage disease type I (0.7%). Patients were frequently diagnosed as adults, particularly those with mitochondrial disease and lysosomal storage disorders. Many patients are only diagnosed in adulthood (> 40%) and the cohort is increasing substantially with 9 651 patients included in the final analysis (34% increase compared to our original paper). Thus reinforcing the need for adult specialists to be trained in this area."

    "title": "Simple steps to achieve harmonisation and standardisation of dried blood spot phenylalanine measurements and facilitate consistent management of patients with phenylketonuria.",
    "abstract": "Management of phenylketonuria (PKU) relies upon life-long monitoring of phenylalanine (Phe) in dried blood spots (DBS), thus comparability of measurements is important. The lack of harmonisation and standardisation between laboratories, combined with the variable quality of patient-collected DBS specimens, are currently preventing this from being achieved. A traceable, matrix-matched Phe certified reference material, common methodology and means to ensure patient collected DBS specimens are of consistent quality would improve comparability between laboratories. Baseline inter-laboratory (n=15) variation of DBS Phe was determined by triplicate measurement of four DBS materials, on three days. Laboratories prepared and analysed these samples using their routine method of analysis. A sub-set of laboratories (n=5) repeated the process using a common sample preparation and instrument methodology (LC-MS/MS), and three different calibration approaches. Samples prepared on dried blood spot microsampling cards (DBS-MCs) from whole blood, value assigned for Phe concentration by National Measurement Laboratories (NML), were then analysed using the harmonised methodology. Inter-laboratory co-efficient of variation (CV) differed with calibration approach; internal calibration 27.7 %; in-house aqueous calibration 4.7 %; centrally distributed aqueous calibration, 2.1 %. Inter-laboratory CV was reduced from 8.7 to 2.1 % by using common sample preparation and LC-MS/MS methodology. No significant difference was observed between consensus and assigned values for Phe in the four materials (p>0.05). This study demonstrates a simple approach to harmonising and standardising DBS Phe measurements, traceable to value assigned materials. Combined with the introduction of DBS-MCs to ensure specimen quality, clinical laboratories can achieve comparability of patient results over time."

    "title": "L-carnitine protects against oxidative damage and neuroinflammation in cerebral cortex of rats submitted to chronic chemically-induced model of hyperphenylalaninemia.",
    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria is a genetic disorder characterized by high phenylalanine levels, the main toxic metabolite of the disease. Hyperphenylalaninemia can cause neurological impairment. In order to avoid this symptomatology, patients typically follow a phenylalanine-free diet supplemented with a synthetic formula that provides essential amino acids, including L-carnitine. This work aims to evaluate the potential neuroprotective effects of L-carnitine treatment in the cerebral cortex of rats submitted to a chronic chemically-induced model of Hyperphenylalaninemia, evaluating brain oxidative damage and neuroinflammation. We confirm the effectiveness of the animal model, through the increase of phenylalanine and L-carnitine in blood and cerebral cortex. L-carnitine treatment was effective in significantly decreasing the generation of reactive species and attenuating the superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. Significant negative correlations between L-carnitine and superoxide dismutase as well as L-carnitine and reactive species generation were also found, reinforcing the involvement of oxidative stress and the effect of L-carnitine. Besides, L-carnitine attenuated the decrease in IL-4 levels, demonstrating both anti-inflammatory properties and a neuroprotective effect, through the decrease in the overexpression of the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) present in the cerebral cortex of rats with Hyperphenylalaninemia. Our results highlight the neuroprotective role of L-carnitine in the treatment of Phenylketonuria, mainly against neuroinflammation and the oxidative process, contributing to better clarify the pathophysiology of the disease."

    "abstract": "A new era in genomic medicine has been brought by the development of CRISPR-Cas technology, which presents hitherto unheard-of possibilities for the treatment of metabolic illnesses. The treatment approaches used in CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene therapy, emphasize distribution techniques such as viral vectors and their use in preclinical models of metabolic diseases like hypercholesterolemia, glycogen storage diseases, and phenylketonuria. The relevance of high-throughput CRISPR screens for target identification in discovering new genes and pathways associated with metabolic dysfunctions is an important aspect of the discovery of new approaches. With cutting-edge options for genetic correction and cellular regeneration, the combination of CRISPR-Cas technology with stem cell therapy has opened new avenues for the treatment of metabolic illnesses. The integration of stem cell therapy and CRISPR-Cas technology is an important advance in the treatment of metabolic diseases, which are difficult to treat because of their intricate genetic foundations. This chapter addresses the most recent developments in the application of stem cell therapy and CRISPR-Cas systems to treat a variety of metabolic disorders, providing fresh hope for effective and maybe curative therapies. This chapter examines techniques and developments that have been made recently to address a variety of metabolic disorders using CRISPR-Cas systems. Our chapter focuses on the foundational workings of CRISPR-Cas technology and its potential uses in gene editing, gene knockout, and activation/repression-based gene modification."

    "title": "No QT interval prolongation effect of sepiapterin: a concentration-QTc analysis of pooled data from phase 1 and phase 3 studies in healthy volunteers and patients with phenylketonuria.",
    "abstract": "Sepiapterin is an exogenously synthesized new chemical entity that is structurally equivalent to endogenous sepiapterin, a biological precursor of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH<sub>4</sub>), which is a cofactor for phenylalanine hydroxylase. Sepiapterin is being developed for the treatment of hyperphenylalaninemia in pediatric and adult patients with phenylketonuria (PKU). This study employed concentration-QT interval analysis to assess QT prolongation risk following sepiapterin treatment. Data from three phase 1 studies and one phase 3 study were pooled for this analysis. Pediatric and adult PKU patients ≥ 2 years received multiple doses at 60 mg/kg and adult healthy volunteers received a single or multiple doses at 20 or 60 mg/kg. Time-matched triplicate ECG measurements and plasma samples for pharmacokinetic analysis were collected. Prespecified linear mixed models relating ΔQTcF to concentrations of sepiapterin and the major active circulating metabolite BH<sub>4</sub> were developed for the analysis. The analysis demonstrated that there is no QTcF prolongation risk in patients with PKU following sepiapterin dosing at the highest therapeutic dose, 60 mg/kg/day. The final model showed a marginal but negligible QTcF reduction with increasing sepiapterin and BH<sub>4</sub> concentrations. The effect on ΔQTcF was estimated to -2.72 [-3.72, -1.71] and - 1.25 [-2.75, 0.25] ms at mean baseline adjusted BH<sub>4</sub> C<sub>max</sub> of 332 ng/mL (therapeutic exposure) and 675 ng/mL (supratherapeutic exposure) at dose 60 mg/kg, respectively, in PKU patients with food and in healthy volunteers with a high fat diet. Various covariates, such as clinical study ID, age, sex, food effect, race, body weight, and disease status, on QTcF interval were investigated and were found insignificant, except for food effect and age. This study concludes that there is no QTcF prolongation risk in patients with PKU following sepiapterin dosing up to 60 mg/kg/day, and BH<sub>4</sub> and sepiapterin concentrations minimally affect ΔQTcF after adjustment for time, sex, and meal."

    "abstract": "To provide insights and strategies for pegvaliase management in challenging cases with phenylketonuria (PKU) based on the first 5 years of experience with pegvaliase in real-world clinical practice. Twelve PKU experts gathered during a one-day, in-person meeting to discuss clinical cases illustrating important lessons from their experiences treating patients with pegvaliase in real-world clinical practice. Challenges with pegvaliase experienced prior to and during treatment and corresponding strategies to overcome them were discussed. Twelve cases of adults with PKU (eight females and four males, aged 18 to 68 years) receiving pegvaliase were reviewed and discussed. Challenges of the cases included medical or mental health comorbidities, executive function deficits, challenging social or socioeconomic situations, logistical or geographic barriers, or a combination of these; one was considering pregnancy. Despite challenges, pegvaliase was initiated successfully in most cases. Strategies to overcome barriers included individualized education, including side effect action plans, help from support organizations, collaboration with local providers, and use of telemedicine. Recommendations from the clinicians included that comorbid conditions should be monitored closely after treatment initiation and may require collaboration with other healthcare providers. A collaborative relationship with the clinic, ongoing education, and supportive relatives or friends can help individuals to remain adherent to pegvaliase. Suboptimal adherence may be addressed by a daily reminder system, telemedicine, in-home support, or a modified titration plan. Treated individuals with eating disorders require additional follow-up and support to achieve a healthy relationship with food. In most cases, including late-diagnosed individuals, reduced blood Phe levels resulted in improved PKU-related symptoms, including neurological issues. Experience from the presented cases and 5 years of expert experience with pegvaliase in the real-world setting provide insight and guidance for healthcare professionals initiating and managing pegvaliase treatment in complex PKU cases. These cases demonstrate that, through comprehensive assessment and addressing barriers, pegvaliase treatment can be successful in adults with PKU, regardless of prior treatment success, age, socioeconomic, cognitive, or executive function challenges, as well as in those with comorbidities or considering pregnancy. Ongoing documentation of clinical experience is crucial for advancing the management of individuals receiving this treatment."

    "title": "Large Variations in Phenylalanine Concentrations Associate Adverse Cardiac Remodelling in Adult Patients With Phenylketonuria-A Long-Term CMR Study.",
    "abstract": "Despite a phenylalanine (Phe) restrictive diet, most adult patients with 'classical' phenylketonuria (PKU) maintain life-long Phe concentrations above the normal range and receive tyrosine (Tyr) and protein-enriched diets to maintain acceptable concentrations and ensure normal development. While these interventions are highly successful in preventing adverse neuropsychiatric complications, their long- term consequences are incompletely explored. We observed early cardiomyopathic characteristics and associated hemodynamic changes in adult PKU patients and present here the results of a longitudinal evaluation of cardiac phenotype. Fifteen adult patients with PKU (age: 39.8 ± 8.1 years, 9 males and 6 females) underwent a comprehensive follow-up cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging assessment after a mean follow-up interval of 8.3 ± 0.3 years from the initial baseline visit. The CMR protocol included left (LV) and right (RV) ventricular and left atrial (LA) volumetric assessment, LV parametric mapping (precontrast and postcontrast T1 and T2 maps, extracellular volume [ECV]), multilayer LV myocardial strain, systolic and diastolic hemodynamic forces and RV and LA strain and aortic distensibility evaluation. Plasma concentrations of Phe, tyrosine (Tyr) and other biochemical markers of disease were retrospectively collected. For comparison, a group of 20 matched control subjects undergoing an identical CMR protocol was included. On average, the LV end-diastolic volume (EDV) (158 ± 29 vs. 143 ± 29 mL, p = 0.013) and end-systolic volume (ESV) (68 ± 18 vs. 62 ± 18 mL, p = 0.011) were lower at follow-up. In contrast, LV mass (LVM) (72 ± 25 vs. 82 ± 29 g, p < 0.001) and the ratio LVM/EDV (0.46 ± 0.12 vs. 0.58 ± 0.23 g/mL, p = 0.005) were increased, and T1 times were longer (940 ± 42 vs. 1010 ± 35 ms, p < 0.001). LV EF (57 ± 6 vs. 57 ± 7%, p = 0.90), longitudinal (GLS) and circumferential (GCS) systolic strain remained unchanged, but early diastolic hemodynamic (HD) forces were more markedly negative (-19.4 ± 7.0 vs. -26.5 ± 12.2%, p = 0.012), while LA strain 43.8 ± 11.3 vs. 37.3 ± 9.6%, p = 0.031) and aortic distensibility (6.38 ± 1.75 vs. 5.21 ± 1.17 10<sup>-3</sup> mmHg<sup>-1</sup>, p = 0.008) decreased at follow-up. Compared with controls, PKU patients maintain reduced systolic function with lower LV EF and impaired GCS and have more markedly negative early diastolic HD pressures. A higher decrease in Phe concentration (ΔPhe) was associated with longer T1 times, ΔT1 (β = -0.78, p < 0.001), increased ECV, ΔECV (β = -0.61, p = 0.016) and a decrease in systolic function, ΔEF (β = 0.61, p = 0.017). In contrast, variations in Tyr concentrations did not affect the cardiac phenotype. At long-term follow-up, a marked drop in Phe plasma concentration was associated with detrimental cardiac remodelling consisting of decreased LV systolic function and increased diffuse fibrosis, in PKU patients. These new data prompt further investigation into the effects of large Phe variability over time and underline the usefulness of periodic cardiovascular assessment in adults with PKU."

Physical examination and MRI examination showed findings compatible with pyogenic sacroiliitis and an abscess in the left iliopsoas muscle. The patient's clinical and radiological findings improved markedly with empirical antibiotic treatment. Although immune system disorders associated with PKU have been reported previously, to our knowledge, a direct link between PKU and rheumatological diseases has not yet been demonstrated. This case suggests that further research is needed to understand the potential effects of PKU on the immune system and susceptibility to infections."

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) and tyrosinemia type 3 (HT3) are both rare autosomal recessive disorders of phenylalanine-tyrosine metabolism. PKU is caused by a deficiency in phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH), leading to elevated phenylalanine (Phe) and reduced tyrosine (Tyr) levels. HT3, the rarest form of tyrosinemia, is due to a deficiency in 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPD). We report a 5-year-old girl diagnosed with both PKU and HT3. She presented with elevated Phe levels in neonatal screening, and subsequent biochemical tests revealed both hyperphenylalaninemia and elevated Tyr levels. Genetic analysis confirmed the diagnoses, identifying homozygous mutations in both the PAH and HPD genes. Dietary management to maintain optimal Phe and Tyr levels proved to be challenging due to the presence of these two coexisting pathologies especially during infections and due to dietary non-compliance, necessitating frequent adjustments in the treatment strategy. This case highlights the importance of considering multiple metabolic disorders in patients with unexplained clinical and biochemical findings. Early diagnosis and stringent dietary management are crucial for preventing neurological damage and ensuring favorable outcomes in patients with concurrent metabolic disorders."

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is characterized by an autosomal recessive mutation in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene. Impaired PAH enzyme activity leads to the accumulation of phenylalanine (Phe) and its metabolites in the bloodstream, which disrupts the central nervous system and causes psychomotor retardation. Early diagnosis of PKU is essential for timely intervention. Moreover, continuous monitoring of blood Phe levels is indispensable for prognosis, requiring a robust and reliable monitoring system. This study presents an automated lab-on-a-CD-based system for early diagnosis and monitoring of PKU treatment. This miniaturised system contains CD-shaped disposable cartridges, a mini centrifuge, and an electrochemical sensing unit. Modified screen-printed gold electrodes were used for the electrochemical measurements in cartridges. Electrode modification was conducted by electrochemical graphene oxide reduction and deposition on the electrode surface, which increased the sensitivity of the measurement 1.5 fold. The system used amperometric detection to measure Phe in the blood through oxidation of NAD<sup>+</sup> to NADH by the enzyme phenylalanine dehydrogenase. The limit of detection (LOD), limit of quantification (LOQ), and sensitivity of the system were 0.0524, 0.1587 mg dL<sup>-1</sup> and 0.3338 μA mg<sup>-1</sup> dL, respectively, within the 0-20 mg dL<sup>-1</sup> measurement range (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.9955). The performance of the lab-on-a-CD system was compared to the gold standard HPLC method. The accuracy was 83.1% for HPLC and 84.1% for the lab-on-a-CD system. In conclusion, this study successfully developed a portable diagnostic device for rapid (under 20 min), accurate and highly sensitive detection of Phe in whole blood."

    "abstract": "Newborn screening (NBS) represents an important public health measure for the early detection of specified disorders; such screening can prevent disability and death, not only from metabolic disorders but also from endocrine, hematologic, immune, and cardiac disorders. Screening for critical congenital conditions affecting newborns' health is a great challenge, especially in developing countries such as Morocco, where NBS program infrastructure is lacking. In addition, the consanguinity rate is high in Morocco. This study aimed to demonstrate the feasibility of integrating NBS into a diagnostic laboratory for routine analysis. Six primary severe conditions were included: congenital hypothyroidism (CH), cystic fibrosis (CF), phenylketonuria (PKU), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PD), congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), and hemoglobinopathies. A retrospective investigation was carried out to examine the outcomes of NBS in Casablanca, Morocco. A total of 5511 newborn blood samples were collected via heel-prick sampling and tested for the above disorders. Most of the samples were collected within the third and sixth days of birth. The dried blood spots were analyzed via a quantitative immunofluorescence technique and isoelectric focusing. A total of 72 newborns had one of the six pathological conditions. The most prevalent disorders were hemoglobinopathies, which were identified in 47 newborns (0.9%), with 29 having HbC carrier status (0.5%), 15 having Hb S carrier status (0.3%), and 3 having an Hb Bart's carrier profile (0.05%). This was followed by G6PD deficiency, which was found to affect 16 newborns (0.32% of cases). CF was found in one case (0.02%), whereas five newborns (0.09%) tested positive for CAH. Additionally, two newborns (0.04%) tested positive for CH, and one newborn tested positive for PKU (0.02%). Our findings underscore the importance and success of NBS programs in preventing morbidity and mortality and improving the quality of life of affected neonates. The significant gap in data and research on these disorders within the Moroccan population highlights the urgent need to integrate NBS into routine practice in diagnostic laboratories across Morocco. This integration is crucial for enhancing the health and well-being of Moroccan newborns."

Managing phenylketonuria involves implementing dietary interventions to control phenylalanine levels and prevent complications. However, these treatments can lead to long-lasting negative effects, including impacts on bone health and abnormal biochemical test findings. The aim of the study was to examine the relationship between biological markers and bone density in individuals with phenylketonuria. This cross-sectional study was conducted out at Motahari Hospital in Urmia, Iran. The study involved 19 patients with phenylketonuria, examining their demographic information, laboratory findings, and bone density by statistical methods. The study examined the association between age and bone densitometry outcomes, along with the connection between different biochemical markers and bone densitometry results. The analysis showed no statistically significant link between age and bone densitometry data (<i>P</i>-value = 0.31). The <i>p</i>-values for correlation between bone densitometry and serum calcium, serum phosphorus, phenylalanine, alkaline phosphatase, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D₃ were found to be 0.30, 0.27, 0.57, 0.86, and 0.95, respectively. The only significant relationship was between the result of bone densitometry and alkaline phosphatase levels in the age group below 8 years with a correlation of 0.720 (<i>P</i>-value = 0.01). The study revealed no association between bone densitometry and levels of serum calcium, serum phosphorus, phenylalanine, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D₃.

    "abstract": "Phenylalanine (PA) levels below 360 µmol/L do not require treatment; however, cognitive deficits have been observed in patients with elevated PA levels, necessitating a safe upper limit for treatment and therapeutic objectives. The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the correlation between developmental assessments (Denver Developmental Screening Test-II [DDST-II] and Ankara Developmental Screening Inventory [ADSI]) and electroencephalogram (EEG) findings with blood PA levels and genotypic data in non-phenylketonuria mild Hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA) patients, to re-evaluate their treatment status based on potential adverse outcomes. This study encompassed 40 patients aged 1-5 years diagnosed with HPA and not on treatment, identified through initial blood PA levels, and monitored for a minimum of 1 year on an unrestricted diet. Data on demographics, serum PA levels during presentation and follow-up, and genetic mutations were retrieved from hospital records. Patients were categorized into two groups as well-controlled (120-240 µmol/L) and at-risk (240-360 µmol/L) based on average PA levels. Sleep-activated EEGs and developmental assessments using the DDST-II and ADSI were conducted to compare outcomes with PA levels and genetic findings. Developmental delays in the DDST-II were observed across language, gross motor, fine motor, and personal-social domains, predominantly in males. No significant difference in delays was noted between the well-controlled and at-risk groups based on PA levels. The ADSI revealed delays in similar developmental areas, with fine motor skills being particularly prominently affected in the at-risk group. Only a well-controlled patient showed abnormal EEG results deemed unrelated to HPA. Our findings indicate that children with untreated PA levels above 240 µmol/L are particularly susceptible to fine motor skill impairments, suggesting a need to reassess the PA level thresholds for initiating treatment. This study highlights the potential requirement for amending current guidelines to ensure early and appropriate intervention in non-PKU mild HPA patients, thereby mitigating the risk of developmental delays. • It is known that phenylalanine levels between 120 and 360 μmol/L typically do not require intervention in non-PKU mild HPA patients, but outcomes for levels near this threshold remain unclear. • Children with PA levels exceeding 240 µmol/L are at a higher risk of fine motor skill impairment, requiring a reassessment of safe PA levels to prevent developmental delays. • In addition, the Denver Developmental Screening Test II reveals developmental delays in multiple areas in children with non-PKU mild HPA, particularly in males, highlighting the need for gender-specific monitoring and intervention strategies."

    "abstract": "Serotonin exerts numerous neurological and physiological actions in the brain and in the periphery. It is generated by two different tryptophan hydroxylase enzymes, TPH1 and TPH2, in the periphery and in the brain, respectively, which are members of the aromatic amino acid hydroxylase (AAAH) family together with phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH), degrading phenylalanine, and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), generating dopamine. In this study, we show that the co-chaperone DNAJC12 is downregulated in serotonergic neurons in the brain of mice lacking TPH2 and thereby central serotonin. DNAJC12 has been described to regulate the stability of PAH and mutations in its gene cause hyperphenylalaninemia and neurological symptoms in patients. We show that DNAJC12 also binds and stabilizes TPH1 and TPH2 in transfected cells. In order to clarify the importance of DNAJC12 in the regulation of neurotransmitter synthesis and phenylalanine degradation in vivo, we generated DNAJC12-deficient mice. These mice show reduced levels and activity of PAH, TPH2, and TPH1 in liver, brain, and pineal gland, respectively, and experience hyperphenylalaninemia and central and peripheral serotonin deficiency. These data support a pivotal role of DNAJC12 in the regulation of AAAH and thereby in neurotransmitter synthesis and phenylalanine homeostasis."

We aimed to evaluate bone mineral density (BMD) in adults with cPKU and determine the risk factors associated with low BMD. Eighty adult patients with cPKU were examined, including 41 women and 39 men. The age range was 18.3-39.4 years (median 22.8). The femoral and lumbar BMD were measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. The patients were evaluated in two groups with low (Z-score ≤-2) and normal BMD (Z-score > -2). Low BMD was detected in 20 patients (25%). The low BMD group had significantly more males (75% vs 40%, <i>p</i> < 0.01) and lower mean body mass index (BMI, 22.4 vs 24.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, <i>p</i> = 0.02). Paradoxically, mean blood calcium and 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels were higher in the low BMD group, but only marginally (10.0 vs 9.8 mg/dl and 25.1 vs 21.0 µg/L respectively, <i>p</i> < 0.05). The groups did not differ significantly with regards to age, mean Phe levels at diagnosis, median Phe levels above the age of 12 years, other nutritional parameters or vitamin-mineral supplementation. There was no history of clinical fractures. Although osteopenia, osteoporosis and low BMD have been reported in PKU, conflicting data also exist. Our study of a large adult cPKU cohort strongly supports previously published limited data that suggest male sex and low BMI confer a higher risk for low BMD in cPKU; and age, Phe levels and dietary adherence do not. In our study, although the patients were young, low BMD was quite common (25%). Bone health should be evaluated even in young adults with cPKU, especially in males and those with low BMI, regardless of treatment compliance and vitamin-mineral status. Prospective studies reporting on clinical outcomes such as bone pain or fractures will be valuable in the coming years."

State-of-the-art analyses of speech detected a dimension of verbal discourse providing insights that extend beyond those captured by existing paradigms to measure performance associated with biochemical markers in PKU. The Cookie Theft Picture Task provided a standardized stimulus for eliciting spontaneous speech from 42 adults with PKU and 41 adults without PKU. Subtests measuring language and memory from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Fourth Edition showed no differences between the groups and no correlations with biomarkers in PKU. In contrast, AI analyses of responses to the Cookie Theft Task revealed significant differences between the PKU and non-PKU groups on 23 linguistic features. Using multidimensional scaling (MDS), these features were aggregated into a single quantifiable Dimension 1 that significantly correlated with biomarkers. When extreme examples of Dimension 1 were presented to chatGPT, the differences noted reflected attention to detail, clarity in word choice, expression cohesion, contextual awareness and emotion recognition. We subsequently defined Dimension 1 as Proficiency in Verbal Discourse. This novel measure elucidated discourse styles possibly associated with suboptimal achievement and learning disabilities, often reported in PKU. In summary, AI captured a characteristic associated with metabolic status undetectable through traditional neuropsychological measures. Future studies will expand upon this novel paradigm, leveraging speech AI to quantify meaningful aspects of everyday functioning and possibly provide information for management decisions. Once validated, this measure holds promise for extension to other rare diseases and incorporation into clinical trials."

Females significantly improved their knowledge about diet (90% vs. 100%, <i>p</i> = 0.035) and metabolism (91% vs. 100%, <i>p</i> = 0.016), but not concerning gynecological topics. Patients' median depression scores were within the normative range, with a slight decrease over time (6 points vs. 4 points, <i>p</i> = 0.836). Patients' anxiety score remained stable over time (5.5 vs. 5, <i>p</i> = 0.247). Of trained mothers with PKU, four pregnancies with ideal metabolic control and healthy offspring could be observed. We suggest the inclusion of specific training programs in the standard care of female young adults with PKU, including for their partners."

    "title": "Oral health care knowledge among Phenylketonuria patients in the Latvian population.",
    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an autosomal recessive inherited disorder of phenylalanine (Phe) metabolism that results from a deficiency of phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH). Patients with PKU rely on amino acid mixtures and low-protein diets, which often exhibit an acidic nature and pose various challenges to oral health. The objective of the study was to evaluate oral care habits of PKU patients in Latvia and the impact of the recommendations developed on improving oral care. In this study, during a one-month interval before and after the implementation of oral hygiene recommendations, questionnaires were distributed to all patients with PKU diagnosed in Latvia, with a response rate of 78 % (79 of 101). The group older and 18 years of age showed a poorer understanding of oral care even after receiving recommendations, 82 % brushing their teeth twice a day (92 % in the group <18 years of age), continuing 57 % rinsing their mouth after using amino acid formula (75 % in the younger group). Significant improvements were observed only in the respondent group younger than 18 years of age - including increases in toothbrushing twice a day by 25 % (<i>p</i> = 0.001), dental flossing by 23 % (<i>p</i> = 0.001), mouth rinsing after amino acid-based formula by 13 % (<i>p</i> = 0.020). This study concludes that PKU patients older and 18 years of age have a poor understanding of maintaining oral hygiene and the use of the necessary supplements to improve it. Activities are needed in the future that would regularly remind and motivate PKU patients to take care of their oral health."

    "abstract": "To determine the disease spectrum and genetic characteristics of inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) in Xinjiang province in the northwest of China, 41,690 newborn babies were screening by tandem mass spectrometry from November 2018 to December 2021. Of these, 57 newborn babies were referred for genetic analysis by next-generation sequencing, which was validated by Sanger sequencing. A total of 36 newborn babies and one relative were diagnosed with IEM, and the overall positive predictive value was 29.03%. The overall incidence of IEM in Xinjiang was 1:1,158 (36/41,690). The incidence of amino acidemias, organic acidemias, and fatty acid oxidation disorder were 1:1,668 (25/41,690), 1:4,632 (9/41,690), and 1:20,845 (2/41,690), respectively. Phenylketonuria and methylmalonic acidemia were the two most common inborn errors of metabolism (IEM), accounting for 83% (30/36) of all confirmed cases. Some hotspot mutations were observed for several IEMs, including <i>PAH</i> gene c.158G > A (p.Arg53His) and c.688G > A (p.Val230Ile) for hyperphenylalaninemia. Four mutation types of the <i>MMACHC</i> gene (<i>e.g</i>., c.609G > A (p.Trp203Ter), c.567dupT (p.Ile190fs)) and six mutation types of the <i>MMUT</i> gene (<i>e.g</i>., c.729_730insT (p.Asp244fs)) were found for methylmalonic acidemia. We also found 11 mutations in six genes: <i>PCCB, IVD, GCDH, MCCC1, SLC22A5</i>, and <i>ACADS</i> in this region. This study combined tandem mass spectrometry and next-generation sequencing technology for the screening and diagnosis of IEM. The study provides effective clinical guidance, and the data provide a basis for expanding newborn screening, genetic screening, and IEM gene consultation in Xinjiang, China."

    "abstract": "Adult patients with early-treated phenylketonuria (AwET-PKU) may present some subtle neurocognitive deficits. The aim of the study was to investigate 1) neurocognitive functions in a large group of AwET-PKU 2) the influence of plasma phenylalanine (Phe). Participants: 187 AwET-PKU (classic PKU [cPKU] 81%, mild PKU [mPKU] 14%, and mild persistent hyperphenylalaninemia [MPH] 5%). Cognitive assessments: tests included the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-IV, California Verbal Learning Test-II, Trail Making Test, and verbal fluency tests. Biochemical data: plasma Phe was measured concurrently with cognitive assessments. Episodic memory: cPKU patients had lower performance in immediate recall compared to mPKU patients. There was a negative correlation between Phe levels and immediate recall indices, but no correlation with delayed memory. Processing speed: cPKU patients performed worse than mPKU patients in processing speed tests. Negative correlations were observed between Phe levels and processing speed measures, with more pronounced effects in cPKU patients. Executive functioning: No differences were found between cPKU and mPKU patients on executive functioning tests. No correlation was found between executive function and Phe levels. Working memory: cPKU patients had poorer working memory performance compared to mPKU patients, though no correlation was found between working memory performance and Phe levels. The study reveals neurocognitive deficits in adults with PKU, particularly in episodic memory and processing speed. Higher plasma Phe levels are associated with poorer performance in these areas, especially in cPKU patients. Working memory and executive functioning did not show significant correlations with Phe levels."

    "abstract": "The first cohort of early-treated adults with phenylketonuria (PKU) is reaching middle-age and moving towards old age. We do not know if and how the effects of an aging brain may interact with the effect of PKU. This study compared wellbeing and cognition in 19 middle-aged adults with PKU (age 40+ mean = 45.8) and in a younger adult PKU group (age 18-36 mean = 26.7). The middle-aged PKU group demonstrated more anxiety and depression, and more negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, compared to age-matched controls. They also demonstrated a steep deterioration of quality of life compared to younger adults with PKU. These last results confounded age with the effects of the pandemic, since only the older participants were tested during the COVID-19 pandemic, but taken together, results consistently point to AwPKU being less resilient to age and other life stressors affecting wellbeing. Regarding cognition, the older PKU group demonstrated significantly worse performance than the younger group, and within the middle-age groups, the effect of age was stronger in the PKU group than in the control, even though this was not statistically significant. In contrast, size of impairment relative to an age-matched control group was numerically smaller in older, middle-age PKU group. We discuss possible methodological confounders related to this last result. Our study points to the challenges of using cross-sectional results to track performance across the lifespan and to the need to acquire more corroborating evidence before concluding there is no accelerating brain aging in PKU."

The PAH Deficiency Guideline Workgroup used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation evidence-to-decision framework to develop evidence summaries and practice recommendations based on the recent American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics systematic review. Many recommendations from the 2014 PAH practice guideline are recognized as standard of care in this evidence-based guideline. Key recommendations from the previous guideline that were not supported by strong evidence are now strongly supported; (1) treatment for PAH deficiency should be lifelong for individuals with untreated phenylalanine (Phe) levels >360 μmol/L, (2) individuals with lifelong Phe levels ≤360 μmol/L have better intellectual outcomes than those who do not, (3) achieving Phe levels ≤360 μmol/L before conception is strongly recommended to prevent pregnancy complications and negative outcomes for the offspring, and (4) genetic testing for PAH variants is recommended at birth to confirm diagnosis and guide therapy. We strongly recommend lifelong maintenance of Phe ≤360 μmol/L (using plasma or whole blood) for optimal intellectual outcomes and for reduced teratogenicity, utilizing all available and necessary dietary, pharmaceutical, and patient-educational modalities."

    "abstract": "Alterations in brain structure are frequently observed in adults with early-treated phenylketonuria (PKU) compared to healthy controls, with cerebral white matter (WM) being particularly affected. The extent to which temporary elevation of phenylalanine (Phe) levels impacts WM remains unclear. We conducted a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled crossover trial to investigate the effects of a 4-week high Phe exposure on cerebral WM and its relationship to cognitive performance and metabolic parameters in adults with PKU. In this study, 27 adults with early-treated classical PKU (aged 19-48 years) underwent diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) before and after the 4-week Phe and placebo interventions. Fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD) were analysed using tract-based spatial statistics. Neuropsychological examinations at each timepoint evaluated executive functions and attention. Additionally, brain Phe levels were measured using MR spectroscopy, and blood levels of Phe, tyrosine, and tryptophan were assessed after an overnight fast. Following the Phe period, significant decreases in AD, MD, and RD were observed compared to the placebo period, particularly in the posterior corona radiata and optic radiation. Notably, these WM changes were reversible in patients who first received Phe (n = 13). Cognitive performance and metabolic parameters were not significantly related to DTI scalars after the Phe period. In conlcusion, a 4-week Phe elevation induced reversible microstructural alterations in cerebral WM. Further investigation is necessary to determine the clinical implication of these changes."

    "abstract": "An off-the-shelf Agilent 7100 capillary electrophoresis (CE) instrument was employed for the automated processing and analysis of dried blood spots (DBSs) collected by Capitainer®B volumetric devices. Solutions for DBS elutions were transferred directly into CE vials through a separation capillary by the application of an auxiliary nitrogen gas connected to the external pressure line of the CE instrument. This allowed for liquid handling at pressures up to 15 bar and enabled the use of a single capillary for rapid DBS processing and efficient CE separations. The resulting DBS eluates were at-line injected into a short capillary end, which served for improved instrumental simplicity and short CE analysis times. The current set-up necessitated neither hardware nor software adjustments of the CE instrument, except for the connection of a gas cylinder to an in-built connector. The novel features presented in this study (DBSs with exact blood volumes, high external pressures, and short-end injections) were used for the automated determination of clinically relevant markers, phenylalanine (Phe) and tyrosine (Tyr), in DBS samples. Sensitive and selective Phe and Tyr quantification was achieved by CE-UV in 375 mM formic acid and 0.01 % (v/v) Tween 20 (pH 2.09) as a background electrolyte. The total processing and analysis times per one DBS were <1.5 and 4.5 min, respectively, in a sequence of 36 DBSs, and resulted in a sample throughput of >10 DBSs per hour. The intra- and inter-day repeatability values were better than 5.9 and 1.1 % RSD for peak areas and migration times, respectively, and calibration curves were linear in the 20-3000 μM (Phe) and 20-250 μM (Tyr) range (R<sup>2</sup> ≥ 0.9973). The limits of detection were ≤2 μM and enabled the determination of endogenous Phe and Tyr concentrations as well as elevated Phe concentrations and Phe/Tyr ratios, which are the typical markers for neonatal phenylketonuria screening."

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU), an inborn error of metabolism, when inadequately treated, may lead to nutritional deficits, which could affect bone health. This remains a controversial issue, given that in the majority of PKU cases, bone mineral density is within normal limits. On the other hand, WNT1 mutations are detrimental for bone, as they lead to primary osteoporosis. We present an eleven-year-old girl under a very strict diet for PKU (i.e., with low phenylalanine levels) and severe osteoporosis, signified by the presence of multiple vertebral fractures, which could not be attributed to her inborn error of metabolism. Family screening, including bone densitometry, revealed unexplained osteoporosis in her father and brother. Further genetic workup revealed a new WNT1, disease-causing mutation. The patient's dietary plan was modified, in order to achieve better metabolic control, and she was given vitamin D and calcium supplements. These measures led to great clinical and radiological improvement, without the use of bisphosphonates. In a patient with a chronic disorder known to affect the skeleton, the presence of disproportionally severe osteoporosis should prompt further diagnostic workup, in order to explain the severe bone phenotype, thus enabling more efficient and targeted therapeutic interventions."

Our findings revealed that a single intravenous injection in adult mice and a single intraperitoneal injection in neonatal mice resulted in 19.1%-34.6% A-to-G editing efficiency at the pathogenic mutation site with minimal bystander edits. Furthermore, the dual-AAV8-treated mice exhibited reduced blood Phe levels to below the therapeutic threshold of 360 μmol L<sup>-1</sup> and restored weight and fur color to normal levels. Importantly, the brain function of the mice was restored after the treatment, particularly when administered during the neonatal stage, as levels of monoamine neurotransmitters and metabolites in the brain returned to normal and near-normal levels.

This study aimed to compare the microbiota composition between children with PKU and healthy controls. Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we analysed microbial communities at six phylogenetic levels. Our findings revealed significant differences in the gut microbiota: Euryarchaeota was more abundant in controls (<i>p</i> = 0.01), while Bacilli and Lactobacillales were higher in PKU children (<i>p</i> = 0.019). Methanobacteriales were significantly elevated in controls (<i>p</i> = 0.01). At the genus and species levels, PKU children had higher Streptococcus and <i>Eubacterium dolichum</i> (<i>p</i> = 0.019, <i>p</i> = 0.015), whereas controls had more <i>Barnesiella</i>, <i>Coprococcus</i>, and <i>Faecalibacterium prausnitzii</i> (<i>p</i> = 0.014, <i>p</i> = 0.019, <i>p</i> = 0.014). In the oral microbiota, control children exhibited significantly higher Bacteroidetes (<i>p</i> = 0.032), while PKU children had increased Bacilli and Betaproteobacteria (<i>p</i> = 0.0079, <i>p</i> = 0.016). <i>Streptococcus</i> and <i>Neisseria</i> were more prevalent in PKU (<i>p</i> = 0.0079, <i>p</i> = 0.016). These results suggest that PKU and its dietary management significantly alter the gut and oral microbiota composition. Understanding these microbial shifts could have implications for managing PKU and improving patient outcomes."

It is being developed for the treatment of patients with phenylketonuria. In this study, the ethnic differences in pharmacokinetics and safety of sepiapterin in Japanese and non-Japanese participants and food effects were evaluated. Healthy participants (<i>n</i> = 60) received a single oral dose of sepiapterin at either 20, 40, or 60 mg/kg with a low-fat diet. The Japanese participants received two doses at 40 mg/kg, either under fasted conditions or with a low-fat diet with a 3-day washout period in between. Sepiapterin was well tolerated in all participants, with no serious adverse events. Sepiapterin was quickly absorbed (T<sub>max</sub> 1.4-4.5 h) and rapidly and extensively converted to BH<sub>4</sub> (T<sub>max</sub> ~4 h). Exposures to sepiapterin were <1% of BH<sub>4</sub>. BH<sub>4</sub> exposures were essentially dose-independent between 20 and 60 mg/kg. A low-fat diet increased BH<sub>4</sub> exposures in Japanese participants by 1.7-fold compared with fasted conditions. BH<sub>4</sub> exposures (C<sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>0-last</sub>) in Japanese participants were 10-30% higher than in non-Japanese participants, which is deemed not clinically relevant; no dose adjustment is warranted. The slightly higher BH<sub>4</sub> exposures in Japanese participants are likely due to the higher frequency of <i>ABCG2</i> c.421C>A mutation in the Japanese population."

    "abstract": "In the evolving landscape of biomolecular supramolecular chemistry, recent studies on phenylalanine (Phe) have revealed important insights into the versatile nature of this essential aromatic amino acid. Phe can spontaneously self-assemble into fibrils with amyloid-like properties linked to the neurological disorder phenylketonuria (PKU). Apart from its pathological implications, Phe also displays complex phase behavior and can undergo structural changes in response to external stimuli. Its ability to co-assemble with other amino acids opens up new possibilities for studying biomolecular interactions. Furthermore, Phe's coordination with metal ions has led to the development of enzyme-mimicking catalytic systems for applications in organic chemistry, environmental monitoring, and healthcare. Research on L and D enantiomers of Phe, particularly on bio-MOFs, has highlighted their potential in advanced technologies, including bioelectronic devices. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the advancements in Phe-based supramolecular assemblies, emphasizing their interdisciplinary relevance. The Phe assemblies show great potential for future therapeutic and functional biomaterial developments, from disease treatments to innovations in bionanozymes and bioelectronics. This review presents a compelling case for the ongoing exploration of Phe's biomolecular supramolecular chemistry as a fundamental framework for developing sustainable and efficient methodologies across various scientific disciplines."

    "abstract": "In PKU, it is suggested that casein glycomacropeptide based protein substitute (GMP) may have physiological advantage when satiety, oxidative stress, renal function and inflammation are considered. Its prebiotic properties may also help gastrointestinal (GI) tolerance. In children with PKU, a randomized/crossover trial comparing phenylalanine-free amino acids (AA) vs GMP as the single source of protein substitute for 12-weeks in each arm was conducted. There was a 4-week wash out period with AA in-between. At baseline and end of each intervention, blood and fecal samples were taken to monitor gut health, oxidative stress, renal function, inflammatory markers and plasma amino acids. Satiety and Pediatric Quality of Life (PedsQL) GI symptoms questionnaires were completed. Usual weekly blood spots for phenylalanine and tyrosine were done. Twelve patients (8 males; aged 4-9y) with PKU participated. GMP improved the following GI symptoms: stomach pain (p = 0.003), heartburn and reflux (p = 0.041) wind and bloating (p = 0.018). With GMP, there was also a trend for less constipation (p = 0.068), discomfort with eating (p = 0.065) and nausea and vomiting (p = 0.087). There were no changes on stool gut health markers (IgA, short chain fatty acids and fecal calprotectin). There were no statistically significant differences for renal, oxidative stress, inflammatory and gut health markers or measures of satiety except for adiponectin (p = 0.028) and total antioxidant capacity (p = 0.049), although the latter was possibly without clinical significance. Mean dried blood spot phenylalanine (Phe) was 114 μmol/L higher with GMP vs AA (p < 0.001). There was no difference in tyrosine levels. In conclusion, GI symptoms statistically significantly improved with GMP versus AA. The Phe content of GMP may present challenges when it is used as the only protein substitute in children with classical PKU with low Phe tolerance."

Without treatment, PKU can result in severe intellectual disability and neurological issues. This study aims to present the first cohort of clinically described Ecuadorian PKU patients, analyzing genotype-phenotype correlations and comparing these variants with global databases to improve diagnosis and treatment in Ecuador. Detailed clinical histories were collected, and an analysis of genotype versus phenotype (affected protein domain) of the variant was performed. Among the PAH genotypes identified, we found 15 distinct variants, with c.[754 C > T](p.Arg252Trp); [754 C > T](p.Arg252Trp) being the most frequent genotype (23.68%), followed by c.[1045T > C](p.Ser349Pro); [1045T > C](p.Ser349Pro) (15.79%) and c.[441 + 5G > T]; [754 C > T](p.Arg252Trp) (13.16%). Additionally, several unique genotypes were identified, such as c.[140G > A](p.Ala47Val); [140G > A](p.Ala47Val) and c.[331 C > T](p.Arg111Ter); [1243G > A](p.Asp415Asn), which are not commonly reported in other populations. Most genotypes were heterozygous (63.2%). The majority of variants were missense variants (66.6%) affecting the catalytic domain (53.3%). The highest phenylalanine levels were found in patients with c.[754 C > T](p.Arg252Trp); [754 C > T] (p.Arg252Trp) (2700 umol/L). Phenotypic data were available for 11 patients, showing 45.45% with classic PKU, 45.45% with mild hyperphenylalaninemia, and 9% with mild PKU. There was a 63.6% concordance with the BIOPKU database. Five low-frequency genotypes not reported in BIOPKU were identified, suggesting unique regional variants. Our study highlights the genetic complexity of PKU in Ecuador, with a high prevalence of unique variants not commonly found in other regions. This underscores the necessity for region-specific genetic analysis to improve PKU diagnosis and treatment. The findings emphasize the importance of tailored therapeutic strategies and continued research to enhance outcomes for PKU patients in Latin America."

    "abstract": "This study aimed to analyze whether early-treated adults with phenylketonuria (PKU) can subjectively sense high phenylalanine (Phe) concentrations and whether a possible impact of Phe on objective measures of cognitive performance and mood reflects patients' self-perception. Data from the PICO study, a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover trial, were analyzed. Twenty-eight adults with PKU received either Phe capsules or placebo in two 4-week intervention periods in a randomized order, with a 4-week washout in between. The median Phe level increased from 852 μmol/L (interquartile range: 345) to 1455 μmol/L (interquartile range: 369). Neuropsychological assessments were performed at four study visits. At the end of the last study visit, patients were asked whether they could discern the Phe intervention period. Seven of 28 (25%) patients stated that they could not discern between the Phe and the placebo period. Twenty-one of 28 (75%) patients subjectively thought to sense high Phe levels. Of the 21 patients, 12 (57%) correctly identified the Phe period, whereas 9 (43%) received placebo at the time when they thought they would receive the high Phe load. Binomial tests showed that the probability of 12 out of 21 is <i>p</i> = 0.140, and 12 out of 28 is <i>p</i> = 0.113. The \"Right-Guess\" group showed significantly higher Phe changes than the \"Wrong-Guess\" group. Cognitive performance and standardized mood assessment did not significantly differ, and both groups reported similar subjective negative impact on cognition and mood. In conclusion, adults with early-treated PKU cannot effectively identify high Phe levels, although some individuals may be able to perceive more pronounced increases in Phe levels."

As a result, detailed and comprehensive reports on the safety of sapropterin in large, real-world populations are required. The purpose of this study is to undertake a complete analysis of sapropterin's adverse events (AEs) using the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database. We retrieved reports of adverse events with sapropterin as the principal suspect from FAERS between the first quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2024. The Reporting Odds Ratio (ROR), Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR), and Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN) were utilized to detect AE signals. The study collected 4,953 suspected AE cases from the FAERS database, with sapropterin as the major suspect. A total of 130 positive signals were obtained utilizing the ROR, PRP, and BCPNN. The FAERS database revealed that common clinical AEs of sapropterin included vomiting, upper respiratory infection, rhinorrhea, and a reduction in amino acid concentrations. Furthermore, we detected probable unexpected adverse events (AEs) using disproportionality analysis, including gastroesophageal reflux disease, flatulence, influenza, ear infection, viral infection, pharyngitis streptococcal, spontaneous abortion, and nephrolithiasis. By analyzing huge amounts of real-world data from the FAERS database, we found potential novel AEs of sapropterin using disproportionate analysis. It is advantageous for healthcare professionals and pharmacists to focus on efficiently managing sapropterin's high-risk adverse events, improving drug levels in clinical settings, and ensuring patient medication safety."

    "abstract": "To conduct an in-depth exploration of the factors influencing unfulfilled needs in caregivers of patients with phenylketonuria. A rapid qualitative analysis approach was used to conduct semi-structured interviews with 16 caregivers of patients with phenylketonuria undergoing specialized dietary interventions, along with 5 medical professionals, within a designated phenylketonuria diagnosis and treatment center in Shanxi Province. Interview data were systematically organized, analyzed, and thematically extracted. Four primary themes were extracted: self-imposed constraints (including insufficient caregiver engagement, economic limitations, and stigma); interpersonal constraints (encompassing social isolation, inadequate social support networks, and lack of doctor-patient interactions); structural limitation factors (inadequate provision of specialized professional support systems, lack of medical dietary supplements, and deficiencies in national policies); and experiential limitation factors (encompassing sensory perceptions of medical dietary supplements and insufficient continuity in psycho-emotional care). The unfulfilled needs of caregivers of patients with phenylketonuria primarily manifest across four dimensions. Greater emphasis on addressing these needs is warranted, necessitating increased attention to patients with phenylketonuria and their caregivers. Specifically, the focus should be directed toward addressing their emotional requirements, along with proactive development of the medical service infrastructure. Such measures are imperative for reducing unfulfilled needs among caregivers of patients and enhancing their prognosis."

    "abstract": "Proteins play a crucial role in determining disease states in humans, making them prime targets for the development of diagnostic sensors. The developed sensor array is used to investigate global proteomic changes by fingerprinting multifactorial disease states in model urine simulating phenylketonuria and in serum from preeclamptic pregnant women. Here, we report a fluorescence-based chemical sensing array that exploits the host-guest interaction between cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]) and fluorescent triphenylamine derivatives (TPA) to detect a range of proteins. Using linear discriminant analysis, we identify fluorescence fingerprints of 14 proteins with over 98% accuracy in buffer and human serum. The array is optimized on an automated droplet microfluidic-based platform, for high-throughput sensing with controlled composition and lower sample volumes. This sensor enables the discrimination of proteins in physiological buffer and human serum, with promising applications in disease diagnosis."

    "title": "Neurocognitive functioning remained unchanged in adults with phenylketonuria: Report of a 15-year follow-up.",
    "abstract": "The long-term prognosis of treated phenylketonuria (PKU) is a controversial issue. A controlled long-term study was performed to assess the neuropsychological outcome in adult patients with early treated PKU. We investigated 27 patients aged 34-55 years (median age: 47 years) and 19 healthy controls, matched for age and socio-economic status. Patients and controls were assessed for their full-scale IQ (FSIQ), attention and information-processing abilities. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain was performed in all patients. Neuropsychological assessments and MRI were repeated at a 15-year follow-up. In the entire interval of 15 years, cognitive performance of patients and controls remained unchanged. Older adult patients showed poorer cognitive performance at all assessment times compared to young adult patients and controls. Cognitive performance showed no correlation to MRI results. FSIQ, however, was significantly correlated with blood phenylalanine levels in the adolescent years of adult patients older than 47 years. Cognitive performance in adult patients with early treated PKU does not seem to deteriorate in a 15 years interval. Neuropsychological assessment revealed constant modest neurocognitive impairment in patients older than 47 years. This seems to refer to an early relaxation of diet that was recommended when the older patients were adolescents."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDThe toxic accumulation of phenylalanine (Phe) in the brain underlies the neurological presentation of phenylketonuria (PKU). Solute carrier family 6 member 19 (SLC6A19) is the major transporter responsible for the (re)absorption of Phe in the kidney and intestine. Here, we describe the characterization of the first small molecule SLC6A19 inhibitor to enter clinical development for the treatment of PKU.METHODSC57Bl/6J WT and Pahenu2 mice were dosed with an inhibitor of SLC6A19 to investigate the effects on urinary amino acids and plasma Phe. In a phase 1 study, healthy human volunteers were dosed with JNT-517, an investigational oral inhibitor of SLC6A19. The primary objective of the study was safety. Secondary objectives included pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies.RESULTSInhibition of SLC6A19 increased the urinary excretion of Phe in a mouse model of PKU, thereby reducing plasma Phe levels. JNT-517, an investigational oral SLC6A19 inhibitor, was found to be safe and well tolerated and increased the urinary excretion of Phe in a phase 1 healthy volunteer study.CONCLUSIONSThese data indicate that pharmacological inhibition of SLC6A19 presents a promising approach to lower toxic elevated levels of amino acids found in PKU and related amino acid metabolism disorders by facilitating their renal elimination.TRIAL REGISTRATIONAustralian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR), ACTRN12622001222730.FUNDINGThe studies in this paper were funded by Jnana Therapeutics."

    "abstract": "Patients with phenylketonuria (PKU) have a highly restrictive diet, which involves restriction of phenylalanine (Phe) intake and daily use of Phe-free metabolic formula. However, little is known about the potential impact of this diet on chemical senses. The present study aimed to evaluate the olfactory and gustatory perceptions of patients with PKU. A cross-sectional controlled study which included patients with PKU on dietary treatment and healthy controls was performed. Olfactory perception was assessed using the 12-item <i>Sniffin' Sticks</i> test, and taste perception using the <i>Taste Strips</i> test. Twenty-five patients (mean age 19.3 ± 4.7 years; 13 females) and 25 controls (mean age 19.9 ± 4.9 years, <i>p</i> = 0.676; 13 females) were included. The mean age at treatment onset was 52.8 ± 29.7 days. The mean scores for olfactory and gustatory perceptions, and for bitter and salty flavors, were lower in patients than in controls (<i>p</i> = 0.039, <i>p</i> = 0.004, <i>p</i> = 0.008, and <i>p</i> = 0.020, respectively). Among patients, Phe levels at diagnosis correlated negatively with bitter taste (<i>r</i> = -0.493, <i>p</i> = 0.006). The lower olfaction and gustation scores found in patients may be related to understimulation caused by the highly restrictive PKU diet and the deprivation of flavors from breast milk."

    "abstract": "Patients with protein metabolism disorders (PMDs) require a diet with strict protein control that can affect their growth and development. The aim of the study was to assess nutritional status and growth in patients with PMDs undergoing dietary treatment. Prospective observational case-control study in 63 patients with PMDs and 63 healthy controls matched for age and sex. We collected data for anthropometric variables (weight, height, BMI, tricipital and subscapular skinfolds, arm and waist circumference) and calculated the corresponding z scores. We also estimated the body fat mass and classified patients into nutritional status categories. The overall analysis found a lower height z score in patients with PMDs and an equal proportion of overweight and obesity with respect to controls (30.2%). When we divided patients with PMDs into 2 groups (phenylketonuria and other aminoacidopathies), we found that patients with phenylketonuria had a height that was similar to the height of controls and significantly higher compared to patients with other aminoacidopathies. When it came to nutritional status, the prevalence of overweight and obesity was greater in the phenylketonuria group (45.5%), while underweight and short stature were more frequent in the group with other aminoacidopathies. Not all patients with PMDs follow the same growth pattern, and their body composition is variable. In our sample, the group of patients with phenylketonuria had an adequate height but also a higher prevalence of overweight and obesity. On the other hand, patients with other aminoacidopathies had a higher prevalence of underweight and lower z scores for height and arm circumference."

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) results from a deficiency in phenylalanine hydroxylase, catalyzing the conversion of phenylalanine (Phe) to tyrosine. Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) consists of physical, behavioral, and emotional symptoms occurring during the last week of luteal phase. The aim of the study was to determine the incidence of PMS, and document menstrual cycle characteristics of PKU patients to reveal the relationship with blood Phe levels. The study was conducted on 74 patients with a mean age of 21.7 ± 5.4 years. The mean age at menarche was 12.7 ± 1.3 years and 82.4 % had regular menstrual cycles. The periods of most patients (47.2 %) lasted 4-5 days. Menstrual cycles of 21-28 days were reported by 73 %, less than 21 days by 8 %, and more than 28 days by 19 % of women. Menorrhagia and dysmenorrhea was observed in 6.7 % and 71.6 % respectively. Adherence to diet was lost in 7 patients during the menstrual period. No significant relationship was found between Phe levels and PMS symptoms (<i>p</i> > 0.05). According to PMSS subscales, 52.7 % of patients with PKU had depressive feelings, 16.2 % anxiety, 55.4 % fatigue, 52.7 % irritability, 28.3 % depressive thoughts, 39.1 % pain, 59.4 % changes in appetite, 28.3 % changes in sleeping habits and 43.2 % had swelling. The findings of the study revealed that PMS prevalence was 39.1 % among PKU women. Awareness about this syndrome, will improve the quality of life in women with PKU by evaluating and taking measures for PMS. Evaluating menstrual cycle characteristics and premenstrual syndrome in phenylketonuria patients provides valuable insights for enhancing their overall health profile and personalizing treatment and management plans."

    "abstract": "The Brazilian Policy for Comprehensive Care for People with Rare Diseases was implemented in 2014; however, national epidemiological data on rare diseases (RDs) are scarce and mainly focused on specific disorders. To address this gap, University Hospitals, Reference Services for Neonatal Screening, and Reference Services for Rare Diseases, all of which are public health institutions, established the Brazilian Rare Diseases Network (RARAS) in 2020. The objective of this study was to perform a comprehensive nationwide epidemiological investigation of individuals with RDs in Brazil. This retrospective survey collected data from patients receiving care in 34 healthcare facilities affiliated with RARAS in 2018 and 2019. The survey included 12,530 participants with a median age of 15.0 years, with women representing 50.5% of the cohort. Classification according to skin color demonstrated that 5044 (47.4%) participants were admixed. Most had a confirmed diagnosis (63.2%), with a predominance of phenylketonuria (PKU), cystic fibrosis (CF), and acromegaly. Common clinical manifestations included global developmental delay and seizures. The average duration of the diagnostic odyssey was 5.4 years (± 7.9 years). Among the confirmed diagnoses, 52.2% were etiological (biochemical: 42.5%; molecular: 30.9%), while 47.8% were clinical. Prenatal diagnoses accounted for 1.2%. Familial recurrence and consanguinity rates were 21.6% and 6.4%, respectively. Mainstay treatments included drug therapy (55.0%) and rehabilitation (15.6%). The Public Health System funded most diagnoses (84.2%) and treatments (86.7%). Hospitalizations were reported in 44.5% of cases, and the mortality rate was 1.5%, primarily due to motor neuron disease and CF. This study marks a pioneering national-level data collection effort for rare diseases in Brazil, offering novel insights to advance the understanding, management, and resource allocation for RDs. It unveils an average diagnostic odyssey of 5.4 years and a higher prevalence of PKU and CF, possibly associated with the specialized services network, which included newborn screening services."

In total, 32 patients with PKU were analyzed and compared with the control participants. Regions of interest in panoramic radiographs were selected and the fractal dimension (FD) obtained from FA was calculated. MCW was defined as the cortical thickness of the inferior border of the mandible at the level of the mental foramen. MCI classified the endosteal edge of the mandibular cortex as C1: straight and sharp, C2: the presence lacunar resorption spaces, and C3: distinctly porous and severely eroded. The significance level was P < .05. All FD and MCW values were significantly lower in the PKU patients. The prevalence of C1 was significantly lower and prevalence of C2 was significantly higher in the PKU group. The differences in FD and radiomorphometric indices between patients with PKU and healthy controls may indicate a potential impact of PKU on mandibular bone structure."

    "title": "What is known about patients' quality of life with Phenylketonuria and their caregivers? A scoping review.",
    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by a deficiency in the metabolism of the essential amino acid phenylalanine, which has a neurotoxic effect at high concentrations. The available treatment for PKU involves limiting the intake of phenylalanine through a restrictive diet. Strict adherence to treatment is essential for a child's proper development. Owing to their rare and chronic condition, PKU patients and their caregivers need to address many specific challenges, which can affect their quality of life (QoL). This review aimed to identify, characterize, map, and summarize existing knowledge about the quality of life of PKU patients and their primary caregivers. A scoping review was conducted following the PRISMA-ScR guidelines. The PubMed, PsycINFO, EMBASE, Scopus, CINAHL, and BVS databases were searched, and articles published between January 2000 and February 2023 were included. The search resulted in 3249 articles, 29 of which were selected for analysis. Most studies were cross-sectional, and the highest concentration of publications ranged between 2011 and 2021. Generic self-report questionnaires were the tools most commonly used to assess patients' and their caregivers' QoL. A significant negative impact on QoL was found in most studies with pediatric patients and caregivers. High current and lifetime blood Phe levels were associated with worse QoL in several domains, and higher tolerance of ingested phenylalanine was associated with a lower impact on QoL. Among caregivers, psychosocial variables such as stress, anxiety, depression, and child behavior problems were associated with poorer QoL. Higher perceived social and emotional support was a protective factor of QoL in caregivers. Patients of pediatric age and their caregivers, younger caregivers, and female patients and caregivers seem to be especially vulnerable to QoL impairments. The social and emotional dimensions were the most affected. These results emphasize the importance of combining generic and disease-specific assessment tools to achieve a comprehensive assessment. Despite the growing interest in this topic, the longitudinal literature is limited, and there is a lack of interventional studies on this population. Future interventions addressing diet management and providing psychosocial support may benefit the QoL of the PKU population."

    "title": "Heavy Metal and Trace Element Status and Dietary Determinants in Children with Phenylketonuria.",
    "abstract": "<b>Background/Objectives:</b> Heavy metals are a group of metals and metalloids that have a relatively high density. They can cause toxicity even at very low levels. Trace elements are required by all living organisms to maintain their normal growth, metabolism, and development. Oral intake is the main route of exposure to both heavy metals and trace elements. Phenylketonuria (PKU) is the most common amino acid metabolic disorder, and the best known treatment for patients requiring treatment is a phenylalanine (Phe)-restricted diet. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the plasma heavy metal levels, sources of exposure, changes in these levels according to dietary regimen, and trace element levels and their correlations with heavy metals in PKU patients. <b>Methods:</b> The study was conducted between July 2022 and January 2024 on 105 patients aged 2-6 years diagnosed with PKU. <b>Results:</b> The percentage of Pb levels in individuals in the upper quartile increased by 3.47 times (95% CI = 1.07-11.29) in those who consumed canned foods and 7.29 times (95% CI = 1.21-44.03) in those who consumed spring water. The percentage of As levels in the upper tertile increased by a factor of 7.26 (95% CI = 2.09-25.28) in individuals under four years of age and 8.17 times (95% CI = 2.13-31.27) in canned food users. The odds of having blood Cd levels in the upper tertile were 0.09 (95% CI = 0.01-0.96) for those being breastfed for 6-11 months compared to 0-5 months. Zn levels were lower (93.0 vs. 83.6 µg/dL, <i>p</i> = 0.008) in patients on a Phe-restricted diet. <b>Conclusions:</b> The present study did not find a relationship between heavy metal exposure and the dietary treatment status of patients with PKU. Our findings indicate that canned food consumption is a significant contributing factor to heavy metal exposure in PKU patients. Furthermore, our findings revealed a relationship between age, perception of economic level, breastfeeding, kitchen equipment, and water usage and the levels of certain heavy metals."

    "abstract": "One of the main objectives of Phenylketonuria (PKU) management is represented by optimising the growth trend under restricted protein diet regimen. The data on long-term growth in PKU children are limited and mostly based on earlier studies. The data for this twelve-year longitudinal study were collected from 34 PKU children and 37 healthy peers, whose auxological parameters were taken at 7 time-points over the follow-up. The weight-for-length ratio (WLR) z-score and body mass index (BMI) z-score were considered according to age. Prevalence of overweight/obesity was evaluated at last assessment. The median BMI z-score of PKU children was normal and not statistically different from that of controls on all the seven time-point assessments. Their distributions tended to be wider than those of peers, with the upper limit exceeding the normal range since 12 months old, with a peak specifically at 3 years of age. In controls, there was a tendency to approach the BMI z-score values of overweight in later childhood. The prevalence of overweight was comparable (29% vs. 25%, <i>p</i>: 0.78) between the two groups at last assessment, and obese subjects (3/37) were only detected in the control group. In this study, we report data from a long-term follow-up on growth, highlighting that the median BMI z-score of PKU children was normal and not statistically different from that of controls. Also, the prevalence of obesity at 12 years of age was overlapping. However, the high prevalence of overweight children in the general population may explain the lack of difference and does not reassure about patients' nutritional risk."

    "abstract": "For gene therapy of the liver, in vivo applications based on adeno-associated virus are the most advanced vectors despite limitations, including low efficacy and episomal loss, potential integration and safety issues, and high production costs. Alternative vectors and/or delivery routes are of high interest. The regenerative ability of the liver bears the potential for ex vivo therapy using liver cell transplantation for disease correction if provided with a selective advantage to expand and replace the existing cell mass. Here we present such treatment of a mouse model of human phenylketonuria (PKU). Primary hepatocytes from wild-type mice were gene modified in vitro (with a lentiviral vector) that carries a gene editing system (CRISPR) to inhibit Cypor. Cypor inactivation confers paracetamol (or acetaminophen) resistance to hepatocytes and thus a growth advantage to eliminate the pre-existing liver cells upon grafting (via the spleen) and exposure to repeated treatment with paracetamol. Grafting Cypor-inactivated wild-type hepatocytes into inbred young adult enu2 (PKU) mice, followed by selective expansion by paracetamol dosing, resulted in replacing up to 5% of cell mass, normalization of blood phenylalanine, and permanent correction of PKU. Hepatocyte transplantation offers thus an armamentarium of novel therapy options for genetic liver defects."

    "abstract": "The <i>PAH</i> gene mutations have been linked to the development of phenylketonuria (PKU), which is recognized as the most common inborn metabolic disorder, and is caused by a deficiency in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (<i>PAH</i>) enzyme. The Iranian population, known for its diversity and high consanguinity, offers a valuable sample for studying autosomal recessive disorders. Our study investigated three unrelated families with PKU from Iran, utilizing clinical, laboratory, and computational approaches. We performed direct PCR sequencing for 13 exons of the <i>PAH</i> gene on three Iranian patients who were diagnosed with PKU. Then, Sanger sequencing confirmed the segregation of the mutations from parents to probands. Pathogenicity predictor tools, including ACMG, CADD, SIFT, Polyphen-2, and Mutation Taster, were utilized to analyze the identified genetic variants. The three-dimensional structure of the mutant forms of the protein was predicted. We also analyzed the protein-protein interactions of <i>PAH</i> using the STRING database. All three patients exhibited rare compound heterozygosity rearrangements in the <i>PAH</i> gene (NM_000277.3). These included three missense variants: [c.533A>G/c.1222C>T], [c.526C>T/c.1222C>T], and [c.533A> / c.526C>T]. This study adds to the body of evidence establishing the association between <i>PAH</i> mutations and the development of PKU. We speculated that the conjunction of a high consanguinity rate in populations such as Iran, coupled with the founder effect, can give rise to atypical genetic profiles, as observed in the rearrangement of compound heterozygosity in this study Moreover, our research underscores the significance of genetic testing in the precise diagnosis of individuals affected by inborn errors of metabolism."

    "title": "Nutrition in phenylketonuria.",
    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a genetic metabolic disease resulting from a deficiency in the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. This defect prevents the conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine, and as a result, the level of phenylalanine in the body increases abnormally. The accumulation of this amino acid may cause brain damage and grows development in these patients. The primary approach to treating the disease involves dietary management that restricts protein and phenylalanine intake, often alongside Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) supplementation. Medical foods specifically formulated for these patients are utilized to supply the necessary energy, protein, and tyrosine. Other treatment options, including the use of large neutral amino acids (LNAAs) and the enzyme Phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), can be utilized to manage symptoms in adult patients. Advancements in gene therapy aimed at correcting defective genes in patients may help restore phenylalanine metabolism, though further research in this area is necessary. Effective personal management of phenylketonuria necessitates enhanced knowledge and collaboration among healthcare professionals to achieve optimal treatment outcomes for patients. This article emphasis the nutritional management of individuals with phenylketonuria across various stages of their lives."

    "abstract": "MSUD and PKU require lifetime management hence, regular monitoring of amino acid levels is needed to achieve good metabolic control. Ideally, plasma amino acid analysis (PLAA) is used to monitor concentrations but is expensive and not widely available in local laboratories. The newborn screening program in the Philippines uses dried blood spot (DBS) analysis as an alternative where only trained healthcare providers are allowed to perform the collection at selected facilities. With the increasing number of patients, DBS monitoring has been noted to be delayed due to multiple factors. This issue became even more evident during the COVID-19 pandemic where high-risk patients need to travel outside for blood collection. The study used a cross-sectional study design to determine the primary caregivers' perspective on DBS self-sampling for patients with MSUD and PKU and the acceptability of the samples collected. This was done through a series of collection training, pre-/post- surveys, and 10-item questionnaire, and an in-depth 1-on-1 interview for thematic analysis. The acceptability of samples was processed and evaluated by the newborn screening laboratory. At-home DBS collection by primary caregivers was found to be acceptable. The provision of knowledge and routine collection training by the medical team aids in the increase of sample acceptability as well as a source of empowerment in being equipped to take care of their child. It is highly recommended that DBS samples collected by caregivers be considered acceptable for more time and cost-saving monitoring of the patients' metabolites. This practice also promotes timely and appropriate management which can lead to better patient health outcomes."

Protein requirements in adults with PKU have not been directly determined. A formula with glycomacropeptide (GMP) and low phenylalanine is available, yet untested for optimal protein synthesis. To determine the protein requirements in adults with PKU and the bioavailability of GMP-AA in the same patients using the indicator amino acid oxidation (IAAO) technique. Each participant was allocated to 7 separate l-AA intakes (range: 0.1-1.8 g/kg/day) in Experiment 1. In Experiment 2, the same patients participated in 4 GMP-AA intakes (range: 0.1-0.9 g/kg/day). The IAAO method with l-[1-<sup>13</sup>C]-lysine as the indicator amino acid and its oxidation to <sup>13</sup>CO<sub>2</sub> was used as the primary indicator of protein synthesis. Protein requirements were identified with a breakpoint, and bioavailability was determined by comparing <sup>13</sup>CO<sub>2</sub> slope from GMP-AA versus l-AA. Six adults with PKU (4 M: 2F) completed a total of 54 study days over the 2 experiments. The estimated average requirement (EAR) for protein was determined to be 1.11 g/kg/day (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.20). The bioavailability of protein from GMP-AA was determined to be 99.98%, which was high and near to 100% comparable to l-AA; although, the results apply only to the tested GMP-AA blend. To our knowledge, this is the first study to directly define a quantitative protein requirement and indicates that current PKU protein recommendations for adults with PKU may be underestimated. The bioavailability of protein in the GMP-AA blend was high and optimal for protein synthesis in adults with PKU."

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria is a hereditary metabolic disorder characterized by a deficiency of phenylalanine hydroxylase. The main treatment for PKU is a phenylalanine-restricted diet. The exclusion of protein rich natural foods and inclusion of low-Phe substitutes may give rise to an imbalanced diet, and the increased risk of overweight and obesity in PKU is a cause for concern. We aimed to evaluate the body composition and nutritional biochemical biomarkers in adult PKU patients who are on Phe-restricted and essential amino acid-supplemented nutrition therapy and to investigate the relationships between these parameters and patient gender, adherence to dietary therapy, and disease type, defined as mild or classic PKU. The study group comprised 37 PKU patients and 26 healthy siblings as controls. The participants were assessed based on an analysis of anthropometric parameters, body composition, and biochemical test results. PKU patients do not have a higher incidence of overweight and obesity than healthy controls, the proportion of energy derived from carbohydrates in their diets was below the recommended level, and their total energy intake was below the recommended daily allowance. It was remarkable that patients with a treatment adherence ratio of <50% displayed a higher prevalence of overweight and abdominal obesity in comparison to those with a more favorable treatment adherence ratio. In view of the growing prevalence of overweight in the general population, PKU patients should be kept under close long-term follow-up. Particularly in the group with low treatment compliance, more caution should be taken in terms of adverse outcomes."

    "abstract": "Pegvaliase, a subcutaneous therapy to treat phenylketonuria (PKU), has allowed these patients to maintain adequate phenylalanine (Phe) blood values without following a Phe-controlled diet; this brings up the challenge of promoting healthy eating while moving away from prescription diets. In our center, every patient treated with Pegvaliase undergoes routine nutritional counseling aimed at promoting adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) during regular inpatient visits. This study aims to assess adherence to MedDiet and the adequacy of the diets of patients treated with Pegvaliase regarding micro- and macronutrients. Seven patients on chronic therapy with Pegvaliase underwent a dietetic evaluation to assess the composition of their diets in terms of micro- and macronutrients; they were also administered the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) questionnaire. Subcategories from MDS were extracted to evaluate the consumption of foods typically included (vegetables, olive oil, etc.) and typically excluded (red meat, etc.) in the MedDiet. To assess the adequacy of the diet, nutrient and energy levels were compared with guidelines for the Italian population. MedDiet adherence in our sample was comparable to the general population; in terms of macronutrients, good adherence to the recommendations was observed, with every one of them met except for excessive simple sugar consumption. Micronutrient dietary intake was inadequate for zinc, iron, selenium, folate, thiamine, and riboflavin. While more work is necessary to help patients treated with Pegvaliase to progress toward healthy eating, our study suggests that nutritional counseling routinely performed during inpatient visits, typically twice a year, effectively promotes healthier eating habits than those observed in the general population."

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) stems from a rare genetic metabolic imbalance attributed to an insufficiency in the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. Within the context of PKU, brain‑derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays a pivotal role in brain function. 7,8‑dihydroxyflavone (7,8‑DHF) operates as a tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) agonist, mimicking the effects of BDNF. This study aimed to examine the effects of administering 7,8‑DHF in chemically‑induced rat models specifically induced to simulate PKU chemically. The rats were subcutaneously injected with phenylalanine and p‑chlorophenylalanine, a phenylalanine hydroxylase inhibitor, along with 7,8‑DHF. The injections began on the 2nd day after birth and continued until the 10th day. Levels of interleukin‑1β (IL‑1β), interleukin‑6 (IL‑6), interleukin‑33 (IL‑33), BDNF, malondialdehyde (MDA), monoamine oxidase (MAO), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) in the brain tissues were quantified using the enzyme‑linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT‑qPCR) was performed to assess the gene expressions of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), nuclear factor kappa beta (NF‑κB), caspase‑3, nuclear factor erythroid 2‑related factor 2 (Nrf2), heme oxygenase‑1 (HO‑1), and BDNF. The results showed a decrease in mRNA levels of iNOS, IL‑1β, IL‑6, and lipid peroxidation in the group that received 7,8‑DHF. These results indicate that administering 7,8‑DHF has the potential to reduce brain damage in PKU by lowering proinflammatory cytokine levels and lipid peroxidation in PKU models. Thus, 7,8‑DHF, as a small molecule, might offer a promising adjunct therapeutic approach for PKU."

    "title": "Pegvaliase treatment normalizes blood neurotransmitter metabolites in adults with phenylketonuria.",
    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is caused by deficient activity of phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH), the enzyme that converts phenylalanine (Phe) to tyrosine (Tyr), leading to a toxic accumulation of Phe and reduced Tyr in the blood and brain. Abnormal Phe and Tyr levels in the brain disrupt normal neurotransmitter biosynthesis and may contribute to the cognitive and psychiatric deficits observed in individuals with PKU. Blood neurotransmitter metabolites (NTMs) may serve as biomarkers that reflect neurotransmitter levels in the brain. In this study, blood NTMs correlated with brain NTMs and neurotransmitters in wild-type and PAH-deficient mice treated with PAH gene therapy. Pegvaliase is an enzyme substitution therapy that lowers blood Phe levels and is approved for individuals with PKU and uncontrolled blood Phe concentrations (>600 μmol/L) despite prior management. The current work evaluated the relationship between blood NTMs and blood Phe in pegvaliase-treated, Phase 3, PRISM-1 (NCT01819727) and PRISM-2 (NCT01889862) study participants (Pegvaliase Group; N = 109). At baseline, individuals in the Pegvaliase Group had lower levels of the NTMs homovanillic acid (HVA), 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenyl glycol (MOPEG), and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5HIAA), and higher levels of the NTM phenylacetylglutamine (PAG) than age- and sex-matched healthy controls. PAG levels correlated positively with Phe levels (r = 0.833; p < 0.001), while HVA, MOPEG, and 5HIAA levels correlated negatively with Phe levels (r = -0.588, -0.561, and -0.857, respectively; all p < 0.001) across all timepoints. In participants with longitudinal NTM measurements available at baseline, 12 months, and 24 months (Pegvaliase Subgroup; n = 91), blood NTM levels improved from baseline with pegvaliase treatment at 12 months and 24 months, and median levels were normalized with blood Phe level reductions below 360 μmol/L after 24 months of treatment with pegvaliase, including in participants with blood Phe <30 μmol/L. In conclusion, blood NTM levels correlated with blood Phe levels, and pegvaliase improved blood NTM levels in a large cohort of individuals with PKU."

    "abstract": "Targeted genome editing has made significant advancements; however, safety and ethical issues have not been fully elucidated, resulting in strict control of the technique. We tested genome editing tools on gametes from a genetically humanized mouse model using a phenylketonuria (PKU) mouse model to gain insights into genome editing in human embryos. The human PKU mouse model Pah<sup>hR111X</sup> mice was generated. The junctional region between exon 3 and intron 3 of Pah was replaced with a 120 bp corresponding human PAH sequence, including the pathogenic common variant c.331C > T in Pah<sup>hR111X</sup> mice. Pah<sup>hR111X</sup> mice successfully recapitulated the PKU phenotype and showed cognitive dysfunction and depressive-like behavior, which are observed in human patients with PKU. Genome editing was applied to fertilized eggs of Pah<sup>hR111X</sup> mice utilizing sgRNA that targets the human sequence. Mice with the corrected allele exhibited normal serum phenylalanine levels. Through genome editing, we validated the utility of sgRNA. The genetically humanized mouse model suggested that germ-line genome editing of the pathogenic variant may be feasible for monogenic disorders by revealing the recovery of the phenotype; however, there are remaining issues with the tool, including its efficiency and accuracy. This genome editing protocol using a genetically humanized mouse model will provide insights for improving current issues and contribute to the establishment of heritable human genome editing protocols."

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria is an inherited condition characterised by neurotoxic accumulation of phenylalanine (Phe). APHENITY assessed the efficacy and safety of orally administered synthetic sepiapterin in children and adults with phenylketonuria. APHENITY was a phase 3, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study performed at 34 clinics, hospitals, and university sites in 13 countries. Individuals of all ages with a clinical diagnosis of phenylketonuria were eligible for inclusion if they had a blood Phe concentration of 360 μmol/L or higher at study entry, whereas individuals with hyperphenylalaninaemia due to pathogenic variants in GCH1, PTS, QDPR, SPR, and PCBD1, consistent with a diagnosis of primary BH<sub>4</sub> deficiency, were excluded. Part 1 was a 14-day open-label assessment of blood Phe concentration response to sepiapterin. In part 2, sepiapterin-responsive participants were randomly assigned (1:1) by a web-response system based on a block randomisation schedule (permuted block size of 2 and 4) to 6 weeks of sepiapterin (forced-dose escalation: 20, 40, and 60 mg/kg per day per consecutive 2-week period) or placebo. The investigational drug and placebo were identical in their appearance and delivery. Dried blood samples were collected for analysis of Phe concentration on days -1, 1 (before dose was administered), 5, 10, 14, 19, 24, 28, 33, 38, and 42 in part 2, either in-clinic or at home. The primary endpoint for part 2, mean change from baseline in blood Phe after 6 weeks, was assessed in the primary analysis set of participants with at least a 30% reduction in blood Phe concentration in part 1, who took at least one dose in part 2. Safety was evaluated in all participants receiving at least one dose of treatment. The completed study is registered at EudraCT (2021-000474-29) and ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05099640). APHENITY was conducted between Sept 30, 2021, and April 3, 2023. 187 people were assessed for eligibility, of whom 157 were enrolled. In part 1, 156 participants were assessed or evaluated, of whom 114 (73%) were sepiapterin-responsive (ie, ≥15% reduction in blood Phe from baseline). In part 2, 98 participants (49 in the placebo group and 49 in the sepiapterin group) were in the primary analysis set. There was a significant reduction of blood Phe concentration after 6 weeks of sepiapterin (-63%, SD 20) compared with placebo (1%, 29; least squares mean change -395·9 μmol/L, SE 33·8; p<0·0001). Treatment-emergent adverse events were reported in 33 (59%) of 56 participants who received sepiapterin and 18 (33%) of 54 participants who received placebo. Most treatment-emergent adverse events were mild gastrointestinal events (11 [20%] of 56 participants who received sepiapterin and ten [19%] of 54 participants who received placebo) that resolved quickly. There were no deaths and no serious or severe adverse events. Sepiapterin is a promising oral therapy for individuals with phenylketonuria, was well tolerated, and resulted in significant and clinically meaningful reductions in blood Phe concentration in participants with varying disease severity.

    "abstract": "Untargeted metabolomics has shown promise in expanding screening and diagnostic capabilities for inborn errors of metabolism (IEMs). However, inter-batch variability remains a major barrier to its implementation in the clinical laboratory, despite attempts to address this through normalization techniques. We have developed a sustainable, matrix-matched reference material (RM) using the iterative batch averaging method (IBAT) to correct inter-batch variability in liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry-based untargeted metabolomics for IEM screening. The RM was created using pooled batches of remnant plasma specimens. The batch size, number of batch iterations per RM, and stability compared to a conventional pool of specimens were determined. The effectiveness of the RM for correcting inter-batch variability in routine screening was evaluated using plasma collected from a cohort of phenylketonuria (PKU) patients. The RM exhibited lower metabolite variability between iterations over time compared to metabolites from individual batches or individual specimens used for its creation. In addition, the mean variation across amino acid (n = 19) concentrations over 12 weeks was lower for the RM (CVtotal = 8.8%; range 4.7%-25.3%) compared to the specimen pool (CVtotal = 24.6%; range 9.0%-108.3%). When utilized in IEM screening, RM normalization minimized unwanted inter-batch variation and enabled the correct classification of 30 PKU patients analyzed 1 month apart from 146 non-PKU controls. Our RM minimizes inter-batch variability in untargeted metabolomics and demonstrated its potential for routine IEM screening in a cohort of PKU patients. It provides a practical and sustainable solution for data normalization in untargeted metabolomics for clinical laboratories."

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria, the most common inherited metabolic disease, results from a deficiency of phenylalanine hydroxylase enzyme activity that causes high blood phenylalanine levels. Most adults do not adhere to the gold standard therapy: lifelong treatment with a low-phenylalanine diet. Elevated and fluctuating phenylalanine levels in untreated adults can cause white matter abnormalities, neurological symptoms, and cognitive dysfunction (executive function). Pegvaliase, a derivative of the phenylalanine ammonia-lyase enzyme, metabolizes phenylalanine to trans-cinnamic acid and ammonia, and is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency for subcutaneous administration in adults with phenylketonuria and blood phenylalanine concentrations > 600 μmol/L. In clinical trials, it reduced blood phenylalanine, even in patients consuming an unrestricted diet. We report longitudinal results on the first three such adults, in whom phenylalanine levels were quantified monthly, starting 1 year before pegvaliase administration and continuing through achievement of a pegvaliase response (defined as six consecutive monthly blood phenylalanine concentrations < 360 μmol/L while consuming an unrestricted diet). Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and neuropsychological assessments were performed before starting therapy and after response was achieved. Our results show that all three patients had significantly reduced white matter hyperintensities on brain MRI and improved executive function on neuropsychological assessment, especially on the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test, which is known to be very sensitive to white matter functioning. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of concomitant improvements in cognitive performance and white matter damage after a pharmacological intervention to normalize phenylalanine levels in adults with phenylketonuria consuming an unrestricted diet."

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is the most common amino acid metabolism disorder. Patients with blood phenylalanine (Phe) levels of ≥6 mg/dL require treatment, and the most definitive treatment is the Phe-restricted diet. Bisphenols and phthalates are widely used endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) found in personal care products, baby bottles, and food packaging. In this study, we evaluated the possible routes of exposure to these EDCs in patients diagnosed with PKU (n = 105, 2-6 years of age) and determined the relationship between the plasma levels of bisphenol A (BPA), bisphenol F (BPF), di-butyl phthalate (DBP), di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), mono-(2ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP), and dietary regimens. Participant characteristics and exposure routes were evaluated according to their dietary treatment status. Thirty-four of these patients were on a Phe-restricted diet, while the remaining 71 had no dietary restrictions. DBP and DEHP levels were higher in those using plastic tablecloths (<i>p</i> = 0.049 and <i>p</i> = 0.04, respectively). In addition, plasma DBP levels were higher in those who used bottled water (<i>p</i> = 0.01). Being under 4 years of age, using plastic food containers, and using plastic shower curtains were characteristics associated with higher MEHP levels (<i>p</i> = 0.027, <i>p</i> = 0.019, and <i>p</i> = 0.014, respectively). After adjustment for baseline characteristics (Model 1), the odds of having a plasma BPA level in the upper tertile were 3.34 times higher in the free-diet group (95% CI = 1.09-10.25). When we additionally adjusted for plastic exposure (Model 2), the odds ratio was found to be 18.64 (95% CI = 2.09-166.42) for BPA. In the free-diet group, the probability of having plasma DEHP levels in the upper tertile was increased by a relative risk of 3.01 (<i>p</i> = 0.039, 95% CI = 1.06-8.60). Our results indicate that exposure to bisphenols and phthalates varies with dietary treatment. The difference in sources of exposure to EDCs between the diet and non-diet groups indicates that diet plays an important role in EDC exposure."

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an inherited metabolic disorder that requires lifelong adherence to a low-phenylalanine (Phe) diet to prevent severe neurological complications. However, maintaining dietary adherence can be challenging for patients and their families. This systematic review aimed to comprehensively evaluate the factors affecting adherence to a low-Phe diet in patients with PKU. A systematic search of multiple databases was conducted, and 49 studies were included in the final analysis. The quality of evidence was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute levels of evidence and the Quality Assessment with Diverse Studies tool. The review identified four main categories of factors influencing dietary adherence: family-related factors (social, psychological, behavioral, and educational), patient-specific factors (psychological, behavioral, educational, and demographic), environmental factors (healthcare professional support, educational and camp-based interventions, and the COVID-19 pandemic), and therapy-related factors (protein substitute formulation, clinic visits, blood tests, and telemedicine). The findings highlight the complex interplay between elements contributing to dietary adherence in PKU patients and underscore the importance of a multifaceted approach to support patients and their families. Future research should prioritize high-quality longitudinal and experimental studies to provide stronger evidence for the PKU community."

Nevertheless, Phe-mediated brain dysfunction is not fully understood. The objective of this study was to address gene expression alterations due to excessive Phe exposure in the human neuronal model and provide molecular advances in PKU pathophysiology. Hence, we performed NT2/D1 differentiation in culture, and, for the first time, we used Phe-treated NT2-derived neurons (NT2/N) as a novel model for Phe-mediated neuronal impairment. NT2/N were treated with 1.25 mM, 2.5 mM, 5 mM, 10 mM, and 30 mM Phe and subjected to whole-mRNA short-read sequencing. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were analyzed and enrichment analysis was performed. Under three different Phe concentrations (2.5 mM, 5 mM, and 10 mM), DEGs pointed to the <i>PREX1</i>, <i>LRP4</i>, <i>CDC42BPG</i>, <i>GPR50</i>, <i>PRMT8</i>, <i>RASGRF2,</i> and <i>CDH6</i> genes, placing them in the context of PKU for the first time. Enriched processes included dendrite and axon impairment, synaptic transmission, and membrane assembly. In contrast to these groups, the 30 mM Phe treatment group clearly represented the neurotoxicity of Phe, exhibiting enrichment in apoptotic pathways. In conclusion, we established NT2/N as a novel model for Phe-mediated neuronal dysfunction and outlined the Phe-induced gene expression changes resulting in neurite impairment and altered synaptic connectivity."

To find new biomarkers, we compared the results of untargeted lipidomics and metabolomics in treated adult PKU patients to those of matched controls. Samples (lipidomics in EDTA-plasma (22 PKU and 22 controls) and metabolomics in serum (35 PKU and 20 controls)) were analyzed using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography and high-resolution mass spectrometry. Data were subjected to multivariate (PCA, OPLS-DA) and univariate (Mann-Whitney U test, <i>p</i> < 0.05) analyses. Levels of 33 (of 20,443) lipid features and 56 (of 5885) metabolite features differed statistically between PKU patients and controls. For lipidomics, findings include higher glycerolipids, glycerophospholipids, and sphingolipids species. Significantly lower values were found for sterols and glycerophospholipids species. Seven features had unknown identities. Total triglyceride content was higher. Higher Phe and Phe catabolites, tryptophan derivatives, pantothenic acid, and dipeptides were observed for metabolomics. Ornithine levels were lower. Twenty-six metabolite features were not annotated. This study provides insight into the metabolic phenotype of PKU patients. Additional studies are required to establish whether the observed changes result from PKU itself, diet, and/or an unknown reason."

This review explores the multifaceted role of LAT1 in neurological disorders, including its structural and functional aspects at the BBB. Studies using advanced BBB models, such as induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived systems and quantitative proteomic analyses, have demonstrated LAT1's significant impact on drug permeability and transport efficiency. In Alzheimer's disease, LAT1-mediated delivery of anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective agents shows promise in overcoming BBB limitations. In Parkinson's disease, LAT1's role in transporting L-DOPA and other therapeutic agents highlights its potential in enhancing treatment efficacy. In phenylketonuria, studies have revealed polymorphisms and genetic variations of LAT1, which could be correlated to disease severity. Prodrugs of valproic acid, pregabalin, and gabapentin help use LAT1-mediated transport to increase the therapeutic activity and bioavailability of the prodrug in the brain. LAT1 has also been studied in neurodevelopment disorders like autism spectrum disorders and Rett syndrome, along with neuropsychiatric implications in depression. Its implications in neuro-oncology, especially in transporting therapeutic agents into cancer cells, show immense future potential. Phenotypes of LAT1 have also shown variations in the general population affecting their ability to respond to painkillers and anti-inflammatory drugs. Furthermore, LAT1-targeted approaches, such as functionalized nanoparticles and prodrugs, show promise in overcoming chemoresistance and enhancing drug delivery to the brain. The ongoing exploration of LAT1's structural characteristics and therapeutic applications reiterates its critical role in advancing treatments for neurological disorders."

    "abstract": "Sepiapterin, also known as PTC923 and CNSA-001, is a synthetic form of endogenous sepiapterin being developed as a novel oral treatment for phenylketonuria. Sepiapterin is a natural precursor of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH<sub>4</sub>) and, when orally administered, is converted to BH<sub>4</sub> via the pterin salvage pathway. In vitro studies have demonstrated that both sepiapterin and BH<sub>4</sub> are both substrates and inhibitors of the breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) transporter. This phase I study investigated BCRP-mediated drug-drug interactions of sepiapterin as a victim and as a perpetrator. An open-label, fixed-sequence, four-period, crossover, single-dose study was conducted in adult male and female healthy volunteers (18-55 years of age). In a given treatment period, subjects received a single oral dose of sepiapterin (20 mg/kg), sepiapterin (20 mg/kg) plus curcumin (2 g), rosuvastatin (10 mg), or rosuvastatin (10 mg) plus sepiapterin (60 mg/kg). The pharmacokinetics of sepiapterin, its metabolite BH<sub>4</sub>, and rosuvastatin were studied, and geometric mean ratios of exposures in the presence and absence of the BCRP inhibitor curcumin or sepiapterin were estimated. The presence of the BCRP c.421C>A polymorphism was evaluated in all subjects. A total of 29 subjects were enrolled and included in the safety analysis. Among them, 26 subjects were included in the pharmacokinetic and drug-drug interaction analyses. Following oral administration 20 mg/kg sepiapterin, sepiapterin was rapidly and extensively converted to BH<sub>4</sub>, and BH<sub>4</sub> maximum observed concentration (415.0 ng/mL) was observed 4.95 h (time to maximum observed concentration) post-dose. Sepiapterin maximum observed concentration and area under the concentration-time curve from time 0 to time of the last quantifiable measurement or the last sample collection time (AUC<sub>last</sub>) were <1% of BH<sub>4</sub> values. Coadministration of the BCRP inhibitor curcumin (2 g) increased BH<sub>4</sub> maximum observed concentration, AUC<sub>last</sub>, and area under the concentration-time curve from time 0 extrapolated to infinity by 24%, 21%, and 20%, respectively. When sepiapterin was coadministered with the BCRP substrate rosuvastatin, there was no effect on the pharmacokinetics of rosuvastatin. BCRP c.421C/A carriers (n = 4) had higher plasma exposures of BH<sub>4</sub> (1.39 × for AUC<sub>last</sub>) and rosuvastatin (1.61 × for AUC<sub>last</sub>) than c.421C/C carriers (n = 22). Greater increases in BH<sub>4</sub> exposures (1.33 vs 1.18 for AUC<sub>last</sub>) were observed in c.421C/A carriers compared with c.421C/C carriers when sepiapterin was coadministered with curcumin. All treatments were well tolerated during the study. Oral coadministration of the BCRP inhibitor curcumin slightly increased the plasma exposure of sepiapterin and its metabolite BH<sub>4</sub> in healthy volunteers. This modest increase was deemed not clinically meaningful. Sepiapterin did not alter the pharmacokinetics of the BCRP substrate rosuvastatin."

The role of social determinants of health (SDOH) in PKU management has not been formally studied, and this investigation evaluates the association between in-home and in-office factors on blood Phe levels in PKU patients. We conducted a retrospective chart review on over 200 patients attending the well-resourced PKU Clinic at Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago. Data included patients' average Phe level, various demographic information, and CDC/ATSDR social vulnerability index (SVI) score. The analysis revealed no significant association between social vulnerability status and average Phe level. However, a significant correlation was found between sapropterin dihydrochloride use and average Phe level. Age interacted separately with sex assigned at birth, pegvaliase use, total Phe samples submitted, and the presence of genetic testing to significantly influence the average Phe level. This study highlights the multifactorial influences on PKU management and underscores the importance of social resources, such as clinic social workers and state-provided formula, in modulating the effects of SDOH on PKU control. Further research in different healthcare settings is needed to understand the social determinants affecting PKU patients comprehensively, which will strengthen advocacy efforts for this population."

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a genetic disorder associated with the metabolic dysfunction of the phenylalanine hydroxylase enzyme, which catalyses the conversion of l-phenylalanine (Phe) to l-tyrosine. Elevated levels of phenylalanine disrupt the central nervous system by impairing the myelination process and leading to mental retardation. Currently, commonly used diagnostic methods for PKU include the Guthrie test, liquid chromatography, and tandem mass spectrometry, all of which necessitate sophisticated infrastructure and costly equipment. Conversely, electrochemical detection methods hold promise in clinical diagnosis due to their high accuracy, rapid response time, and user-friendly nature. The choice of electrodes in electrochemical methods significantly influences sensitivity and analytical performance. In this study, we evaluated the performance of various nanomaterial-modified electrodes and compared their responses to the redox reaction of phenylalanine, focusing on detection capabilities in blood samples. Specifically, we examined carbon nanotube-gold nanoparticle modified carbon electrode (C-CNT-GNP), graphene-gold nanoparticle modified carbon electrode (C-GPH-GNP), electrochemically reduced graphene oxide (ERGO) modified carbon electrode (C-ERGO), bare carbon electrode (C-BARE), ERGO modified gold electrode (Au-ERGO), and bare gold electrode (Au-BARE) using amperometric detection. The performance of these electrodes was compared in terms of their limit of detection (LOD), limit of quantification (LOQ), and sensitivity. Among all electrodes, ERGO gold electrode showed the lowest LOD, LOQ, and highest sensitivity. This study highlights the potential of ERGO-modified gold electrodes for enhancing electrocatalytic activity, thus offering promising prospects for further diagnostic applications."

    "abstract": "Supramolecular hydrogels have a wide range of applications in the biomedical field, acting as scaffolds for cell culture, matrices for tissue engineering and vehicles for drug delivery. L-Phenylalanine (Phe) is a natural amino acid that plays a significant role in several physiological and pathophysiological processes (phenylketonuria and assembly of fibrils linked to tissue damage). Since Myerson <i>et al.</i> [<i>Chem. Eng. Commun.</i>, 2002, <b>189</b>(8), 1079-1090] reported that Phe forms a fibrous network <i>in vitro</i>, Phe's self-assembly processes in water have been thoroughly investigated. We have reported structural control over gelation by introduction of a halogen atom in the aromatic ring of Phe, driving changes in the packing motifs, and therefore, dictating gelation functionality. The additional level of control gained over supramolecular gelation <i>via</i> the preparation of multi-component gel systems offers significant advantages in tuning functional properties of such materials. Gaining molecular-level information on the distribution of gelators between the inherent structural and dynamic heterogeneities of these materials remains a considerable challenge. Using multicomponent gels based on Phe and amino-L-phenylalanine (NH<sub>2</sub>-Phe), we will explore the patterns of ordered/disordered domains in the gel fibres and will attempt to come up with general trends of interactions in the gel fibres and at the fibre/solution interfaces. Phe and NH<sub>2</sub>-Phe were found to self-assemble in water into crystalline hydrogels. The determined faster dynamics of exchange between the gel and solution states of NH<sub>2</sub>-Phe in comparison with Phe were correlated with weaker intermolecular interactions, highlighting the role of head groups in dictating the strength of intermolecular interactions. In the mixed Phe/NH<sub>2</sub>-Phe systems, at a low concentration of NH<sub>2</sub>-Phe, disruption of the network was promoted by interference of the aliphatics of NH<sub>2</sub>-Phe with the electrostatic interactions between Phe molecules. At high concentrations of NH<sub>2</sub>-Phe, multiple-gelator hydrogels were formed with crystal habits different from those of the pure gel fibres. NMR crystallography approaches combining the strengths of solid- and solution-state NMR proved particularly suitable to obtain structural and dynamic insights into the \"ordered\" fibres, solution phase and fibre/solution interfaces in these gels. These findings are supported by a plethora of experimental (diffraction, rheology, microscopy and thermal analysis) and computational methods."

It is estimated that 2% to 3% of live births worldwide are affected by treatable IMDs. Roughly 80% of IMDs are autosomal recessive, leading to a potentially higher incidence in regions with high consanguinity. The study utilized genome sequencing data from 14,060 adult Qatari participants who were recruited by the Qatar Biobank and sequenced by the Qatar Genome Program. The genome sequencing data were analyzed for 125 nuclear genes known to be associated with 115 treatable IMDs. Our study identified 253 pathogenic/likely pathogenic single-nucleotide variations associated with 69 treatable IMDs, including 211 known and 42 novel predicted loss-of-function variants. We estimated that approximately 1 in 13 unrelated individuals (8%) carry a heterozygous pathogenic variant for at least 1 of 46 treatable IMDs. Notably, phenylketonuria/hyperphenylalaninemia and homocystinuria had among the highest carrier frequencies (1 in 68 and 1 in 85, respectively). Population-based studies of treatable IMDs, particularly in globally under-studied populations, can identify high-frequency alleles segregating in the community and inform public health policies, including carrier and newborn screening."

    "title": "Understanding the Effect of Ionic Liquid-Mediated Solvent Engineering on the Kinetics and Thermodynamic Stability of Phenylalanine Ammonia-Lyase.",
    "abstract": "Phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) plays a central role in the phenylpropanoid pathway and in the treatment of phenylketonuria. However, the integration of PAL into sustainable industrial biocatalysis is hampered by its instability under harsh conditions. This study demonstrates that ionic liquid (IL)-assisted solvent (Tris-HCl buffer) engineering enables improvement of the reaction kinetics and thermodynamic stability of <i>Rhodotorula glutinis</i>PAL (<i>Rg</i>PAL) under various stresses. Under optimized conditions, a 66.2% higher K<sub>cat</sub> value, >60% remaining activity after 5 weeks of storage at room temperature, and >80% activity of <i>Rg</i>PAL after incubation at 60 °C for 1 h were obtained in the [Ch][Ac]-blended Tris-HCl solvent compared to pristine Tris-HCl. The spectroscopic and molecular docking results suggest that the higher extent of hydration and the soft interactions complemented by the ILs with the D-chain residues of <i>Rg</i>PAL jointly contributed to achieving more stable and active conformations of <i>Rg</i>PAL. The enzyme showed a higher melting temperature (<i>T</i><sub>m</sub>) in ILs+Tris-HCl compared to that in pristine Tris-HCl, with less change in enthalpy (Δ<i>H</i><sub>fu</sub>) and entropy (Δ<i>S</i><sub>fu</sub>) of unfolding. Overall, IL-mediated solvent engineering alters the microenvironment of <i>Rg</i>PAL and allows the development of a robust PAL-based biocatalytic system."

    "title": "Longitudinal Dietary Intake Data in Patients with Phenylketonuria from Europe: The Impact of Age and Phenylketonuria Severity.",
    "abstract": "In phenylketonuria (PKU), natural protein intake is thought to increase with age, particularly during childhood and adolescence. Longitudinal dietary intake data are scarce and lifelong phenylalanine tolerance remains unknown. Nine centres managing PKU in Europe and Turkey participated in a retrospective study. Data were collected from dietetic records between 2012 and 2018 on phenylalanine (Phe), natural protein, and protein substitute intake. A total of 1323 patients (age range: 1-57 y; 51% male) participated. Dietary intake data were available on 1163 (88%) patients. Patient numbers ranged from 59 to 320 in each centre. A total of 625 (47%) had classical PKU (cPKU), <i>n</i> = 357 (27%) had mild PKU (mPKU), <i>n</i> = 325 (25%) had hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA), and <i>n</i> = 16 (1%) were unknown. The mean percentage of blood Phe levels within target ranged from 65 ± 54% to 88 ± 49%. When intake was expressed as g/day, the mean Phe/natural protein and protein equivalent from protein substitute gradually increased during childhood, reaching a peak in adolescence, and then remained consistent during adulthood. When intake was expressed per kg body weight (g/kg/day), there was a decline in Phe/natural protein, protein equivalent from protein substitute, and total protein with increasing age. Overall, the mean daily intake (kg/day) was as follows: Phe, 904 mg ± 761 (22 ± 23 mg/kg/day), natural protein 19 g ± 16 (0.5 g/kg/day ± 0.5), protein equivalent from protein substitute 39 g ± 22 (1.1 g/kg/day ± 0.6), and total protein 59 g ± 21 (1.7 g/kg/day ± 0.6). Natural protein tolerance was similar between males and females. Patients with mPKU tolerated around 50% less Phe/natural protein than HPA, but 50% more than cPKU. Higher intakes of natural protein were observed in Southern Europe, with a higher prevalence of HPA and mPKU compared with patients from Northern European centres. Natural protein intake doubled with sapropterin usage. In sapropterin-responsive patients, 31% no longer used protein substitutes. Close monitoring and optimisation of protein intake prescriptions are needed, along with future guidelines specifically for different age groups and severities."

    "abstract": "Amino acid (AA)-related inherited metabolic disorders (IMDs) and urea cycle disorders (UCDs) require strict dietary management including foods low in protein such as fruits, vegetables and starchy roots. Despite this recommendation, there are limited data on the AA content of many of these foods. The aim of this study is to describe an analysis of the protein and AA content of a range of fruits, vegetables and starchy roots, specifically focusing on amino acids (AAs) relevant to AA-related IMDs such as phenylalanine (Phe), methionine (Met), leucine (Leu), lysine (Lys) and tyrosine (Tyr). AA analysis was performed using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on 165 food samples. Protein analysis was also carried out using the Dumas method. Foods were classified as either 'Fruits', 'Dried fruits', 'Cruciferous vegetables', 'Legumes', 'Other vegetables' or 'Starchy roots'. 'Dried fruits' and 'Legumes' had the highest median values of protein, while 'Fruits' and 'Cruciferous vegetables' contained the lowest median results. 'Legumes' contained the highest and 'Fruits' had the lowest median values for all five AAs. Variations were seen in AA content for individual foods. The results presented in this study provide useful data on the protein and AA content of fruits, vegetables and starchy roots which can be used in clinical practice. This further expansion of the current literature will help to improve diet quality and metabolic control among individuals with AA-related IMDs and UCDs."

    "abstract": "Lifelong management of phenylketonuria (PKU) centers on medical nutrition therapy, including dietary phenylalanine (Phe) restriction in addition to Phe-free or low-Phe medical foods/protein substitutes. Studies have reported low bone mineral density (BMD) in mixed-age PKU populations, possibly related to long-term Phe restriction. Therefore, a meta-analysis investigating BMD specifically in adults with PKU was conducted. Studies reporting BMD-related outcomes were identified from a systematic literature review evaluating somatic comorbidities experienced by adults with PKU on a Phe-restricted diet (searched February 1, 2022, updated November 1, 2023). Risk of study bias was assessed (Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network checklists). The primary outcome of the meta-analysis was pooled mean BMD Z-scores of different bones. Secondary outcomes were the prevalence of low BMD Z-scores at pre-specified thresholds. Subgroup analyses of mean BMD Z-scores (decade of study publication, controlled versus uncontrolled blood Phe levels, gender) were conducted. BMD-related data from 4097 individuals across 10 studies rated as at least acceptable quality were included. Mean BMD Z-scores were statistically significantly lower compared with an age-matched control or reference (non-PKU) population, across bones, but still within the expected range for age (> -2.0): lumbar spine (seven studies, n = 304), -0.63 (95% confidence interval (CI): -0.74, -0.52); femoral neck (four studies, n = 170), -0.74 (95% CI: -1.25, -0.22); radius (three studies, n = 114), -0.77 (95% CI: -1.21, -0.32); total body (four studies, n = 157), -0.61 (95% CI: -0.77, -0.45). The small number of observations in the subgroup analyses resulted in a high degree of uncertainty, limiting interpretation. Estimated prevalence of BMD Z-scores ≤ -2.0 was 8% (95% CI: 5%, 13%; four studies, n = 221) and < -1.0 was 42% (95% CI: 35%, 51%; five studies, n = 144). Adults with PKU had lower BMD Z-scores than the reference (non-PKU) population but < 1 in 10 were below the expected range for age. The low number of studies prevents identification of which population characteristics are most impacting BMD. This meta-analysis was supported by BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc., Novato, CA and is registered with the Research Registry (reviewregistry1476)."

    "abstract": "The role of genetic testing within maternal medicine is expanding. Advancing technology and the increasing availability of genetic testing have seen more patients receiving a genetic diagnosis than ever before. Improved healthcare and understanding of these rare diseases means that many patients are living well into their reproductive years and starting families. Individual diseases are considered by their patterns of inheritance i.e. autosomal recessive, autosomal dominant and chromosomal diseases. This chapter specifically addresses the following examples and outlines an approach to pre-conceptual and pregnancy management; autosomal recessive (cystic fibrosis, phenylketonuria), autosomal dominant (osteogenesis imperfecta, vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome) and chromosomal (Turner syndrome). For many rare and ultrarare genetic diseases, there may be no clear guidelines or consensus on the correct management in pregnancy. This chapter seeks to provide a framework for the clinician to use to address the unique needs and risk profile of these patients in pregnancy and pre-conceptually and plan accordingly. The role of pharmacogenetics in maternal medicine, the future of education in genetics for patients and clinicians and the important role of genetic counselling are all considered in this chapter. This overview highlights the important role of genetics in maternal medicine and how this can inform management and planning for the safe care of mother and baby."

    "abstract": "Stress hyperphenylalaninemia predicts elevated mortality rates in patients with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF). This study investigated the metabolic pathways underlying this association and identified a unique metabolic phenotype underlying the association between stress hyperphenylalaninemia and adverse outcomes in ADHF. This was a retrospective cohort study. We enrolled 120 patients with ADHF in an intensive care unit (60 with a phenylalanine level ≥112 μM, 60 with a phenylalanine level <112 μM), and 30 controls. Plasma phenylalanine-derived metabolites were measured, and participants were evaluated for 30-day death. Patients with ADHF had extensive activations of the alternative pathways for metabolizing phenylalanine, leading to the levels of phenylalanine-derived downstream metabolites 1.5 to 6.1 times higher in patients with ADHF than in the controls (all <i>P</i><0.001). Extensive dysregulation of these alternative pathways significantly increased phenylalanine levels and contributed to a distinct metabolic phenotype, characterized by increased phenylalanine, tyrosine, homogentisic acid, and succinylacetone levels but decreased benzoic acid and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine levels. Throughout the 30-day follow-up period, 47 (39.2%) patients died. This distinct metabolic phenotype was associated with an increased mortality rate (odds ratio, 1.59 [95% CI, 1.27-1.99]; <i>P</i><0.001). A multivariable analysis confirmed the independent association of this metabolic phenotype, in addition to phenylalanine and tyrosine levels, with 30-day death. In patients with ADHF, extensive dysregulation of the alternative pathways for metabolizing phenylalanine was correlated with stress hyperphenylalaninemia and a distinct metabolic phenotype on the phenylalanine-tyrosine-homogentisic acid-succinylacetone axis. Both stress hyperphenylalaninemia and metabolic dysregulation on this axis were associated with poor outcomes."

    "abstract": "Assessing dietary phenylalanine (Phe) tolerance is crucial for managing hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA) in children. However, traditionally, adjusting the diet requires significant time from clinicians and parents. This study aims to investigate the development of a machine-learning model that predicts a range of dietary Phe intake tolerance for children with HPA over 10 years following diagnosis. In this multicenter retrospective observational study, we collected the genotypes of phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH), metabolic profiles at screening and diagnosis, and blood Phe concentrations corresponding to dietary Phe intake from over 10 years of follow-up data for 204 children with HPA. To incorporate genetic information, allelic phenotype value (APV) was input for 2965 missense variants in the PAH gene using a predicted APV (pAPV) model. This model was trained on known pheno-genotype relationships from the BioPKU database, utilizing 31 features. Subsequently, a multiclass classification model was constructed and trained on a dataset featuring metabolic data, genetic data, and follow-up data from 3177 events. The final model was fine-tuned using tenfold validation and validated against three independent datasets. The pAPV model achieved a good predictive performance with root mean squared error (RMSE) of 1.53 and 2.38 on the training and test datasets, respectively. The variants that cause amino acid changes in the region of 200-300 of PAH tend to exhibit lower pAPV. The final model achieved a sensitivity range of 0.77 to 0.91 and a specificity range of 0.8 to 1 across all validation datasets. Additional assessment metrics including positive predictive value (0.68-1), negative predictive values (0.8-0.98), F1 score (0.71-0.92), and balanced accuracy (0.8-0.92) demonstrated the robust performance of our model. Our model integrates metabolic and genetic information to accurately predict age-specific Phe tolerance, aiding in the precision management of patients with HPA. This study provides a potential framework that could be applied to other inborn errors of metabolism."

    "title": "Health economic impact of patients with phenylketonuria (PKU) in France - A nationwide study of health insurance claims data.",
    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an inherited metabolic disease. If left untreated, it can lead to severe irreversible intellectual disability and can cause seizures, behavior disturbance, and white matter disease. This study aimed at evaluating the health economic impact of patients with PKU in France. This retrospective observational study used health insurance claims data from the French SNDS (Système National des Données de Santé) database, which contains data from over 66 million French inhabitants. Patients with PKU were identified by ICD-10 diagnosis codes E70.0 (PKU) and E70.1 (Other hyperphenylalaninemia) documented as a chronic condition (affection de longue durée - ALD) or in the inpatient setting in the SNDS database between 2006 and 2018. Patients with PKU were matched to controls without PKU by age, sex, and region. Patients with early- and late-diagnosed PKU were defined as patients born after and before the implementation of nationwide newborn screening in France in 1972, respectively. Outcomes were analyzed for the year 2018. Overall, 3549 patients with PKU were identified in the database on January 1st, 2018. Of those, 3158 patients versus 15,703 controls with at least one healthcare consumption in 2018 were available for outcome analyses. Patients with PKU had 7.7 times higher healthcare costs than non-PKU controls in 2018 (€11,144 versus 1456 mean costs; <i>p</i> < 0.0001). Pharmaceutical costs including dietary amino acid supplements were the cost driver and contributed 80.0% of the overall mean difference (MD) between patients with PKU and matched non-PKU controls. More than half (52.4%) of the mean pharmaceutical costs per patient with PKU was attributable to medical foods including dietary amino acid supplements.Of the 3158 patients with PKU, 2548 (80.7%) were classified as early-diagnosed and 610 (19.7%) as late-diagnosed. Increased healthcare costs, in comparison to non-PKU controls, were more evident in early-diagnosed patients (€11,263 versus €855 mean costs; 13.2-fold increase; <i>p</i> < 0.0001). For patients with late-diagnosed PKU, healthcare costs were 2.7-fold higher compared to matched non-PKU controls (€10,644 versus €3951 mean costs; p < 0.0001). Outpatient pharmaceutical costs accounted for 89.1% of the MD between early-diagnosed patients and controls. Among late-diagnosed patients, 55.5% of the MD were attributable to costs for inpatient care, followed by costs for outpatient care (23.9%) and outpatient pharmaceutical costs (20.6%). The results indicate that PKU is associated with substantially increased health care costs compared to non-PKU controls in France. The health economic impact was most evident in patients with early-diagnosed PKU due to increased outpatient pharmaceutical costs, especially for medical foods including dietary amino acid supplements. For late-diagnosed and by definition older patients with PKU, the excess costs compared with matched controls were mostly driven by costs for inpatient care."

    "title": "The Simultaneous Inhibition of Solute Carrier Family 6 Member 19 and Breast Cancer Resistance Protein Transporters Leads to an Increase of Indoxyl Sulfate (a Uremic Toxin) in Plasma and Kidney.",
    "abstract": "Solute carrier family 6 member 19 (SLC6A19) inhibitors are being studied as therapeutic agents for phenylketonuria. In this work, a potent SLC6A19 inhibitor (RA836) elevated rat kidney uremic toxin indoxyl sulfate (IDS) levels by intensity (arbitrary unit) of 13.7 ± 7.7 compared with vehicle 0.3 ± 0.1 (<i>P</i> = 0.01) as determined by tissue mass spectrometry imaging analysis. We hypothesized that increased plasma and kidney levels of IDS could be caused by the simultaneous inhibition of both Slc6a19 and a kidney IDS transporter responsible for excretion of IDS into urine. To test this, we first confirmed the formation of IDS through tryptophan metabolism by feeding rats a Trp-free diet. Inhibiting Slc6a19 with RA836 led to increased IDS in these rats. Next, RA836 and its key metabolites were evaluated in vitro for inhibiting kidney transporters such as organic anion transporter (OAT)1, OAT3, and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). RA836 inhibits BCRP with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 0.045 <i>μ</i>M but shows no significant inhibition of OAT1 or OAT3. Finally, RA836 analogs with either potent or no inhibition of SLC6A19 and/or BCRP were synthesized and administered to rats fed a normal diet. Plasma and kidney samples were collected to quantify IDS using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Neither a SLC6A19 inactive but potent BCRP inhibitor nor a SLC6A19 active but weak BCRP inhibitor raised IDS levels, whereas compounds inhibiting both transporters caused IDS accumulation in rat plasma and kidney, supporting the hypothesis that rat Bcrp contributes to the excretion of IDS. In summary, we identified that inhibiting Slc6a19 increases IDS formation, while simultaneously inhibiting Bcrp results in IDS accumulation in the kidney and plasma. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: This is the first publication to decipher the mechanism for accumulation of indoxyl sulfate (IDS) (a uremic toxin) in rats via inhibition of both Slc6a19 and Bcrp. Specifically, inhibition of Slc6a19 in the gastrointestinal track increases IDS formation, and inhibition of Bcrp in the kidney blocks IDS excretion. Therefore, we should avoid inhibiting both solute carrier family 6 member 19 and breast cancer resistance protein simultaneously in humans to prevent accumulation of IDS, a known risk factor for cardiovascular disease, psychic anxiety, and mortality in chronic kidney disease patients."

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria is a rare inherited disorder that disrupts the metabolism of phenylalanine (Phe) to tyrosine by phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH). Sapropterin dihydrochloride (Kuvan®) is approved for use in Europe to reduce blood Phe levels and improve Phe tolerance in sapropterin-responsive individuals. KAMPER (NCT01016392) is an observational, multinational registry assessing long-term safety and efficacy of sapropterin. Five hundred and seventy-six participants with PAH deficiency were enrolled from nine European countries (69 sites; December 2009-May 2016). Participants were aged <4 years (n = 11), 4 to <12 years (n = 329), 12 to <18 years (n = 141), and ≥18 years (n = 95) at enrolment. Overall, 401 (69.6%) participants experienced a total of 1960 adverse events; 61 events in 42 participants were serious, and two were considered sapropterin-related by the investigator. Mean (standard deviation) actual dietary Phe intake increased from baseline across all age groups: 957 (799) mg/day to a maximum of 1959 (1121) mg/day over a total study period of 11 years. Most participants exhibited an increase in Phe tolerance while blood Phe levels remained in the target range for their age (120-360 μmol/L for <12 years; 120-600 μmol/L for ≥12 years). Most participants exhibited normal growth for height, weight, and body mass index. No additional safety concerns were identified. As an observational study, limitations include variability in routine care practices and inconsistent availability of data. Long-term sapropterin use demonstrates a favourable safety profile in real-world settings and increases Phe tolerance in participants with PAH deficiency while maintaining blood Phe levels in the target ranges."

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is one of the most common genetic metabolic diseases, especially among newborns. Traditional clinical examination of newborn blood samples for PKU is invasive, laborious, and limited to hospitals and healthcare facilities. We reported herein a SERS-based sensor array with three thiophenolic nanoreceptors built on a patterned nanorod vertical array for rapid and inexpensive detection of characteristic volatile biomarkers indicative of PKU in the urine and accurate classification of newborn baby patients all performed on a hand-held SERS spectrophotometer. The well-ordered array was generated from the volatility-driven assembly of gold nanorods (AuNRs) into an upright and closely packed hexagonal configuration. The uniformly distributed nanowells between AuNRs offered an intense and aspect-ratio-dependent plasmonic field for the molecular enhancement of SERS outputs. The SERS-based detector was integrated into a test chip for regular monitoring of volatile phenylketone bodies in the spiked solution or patients' urine within 5 min, allowing the quantification of a wide variety of normal or abnormal metabolites at their physiologically relevant concentration range. The detection limits for common biomarkers of PKU, including phenylpyruvic acid, 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, and phenylacetic acid, were at a few μM and well below the diagnostic thresholds. Moreover, the volatile headspace mixtures from a given urine sample could be fingerprinted by the sensor array and discriminated using machine-learning algorithms. Ultimately, the discrimination of baby patients among 26 cases of mild and classic PKU phenotypes and 17 cases of healthy volunteers could be realized with an overall accuracy of 97%. This hand-held SERS platform plays a pivotal role in advancing healthcare applications in quick screening of neonatal PKU through a facile urinary vapor test."

    "abstract": "A phenylalanine-restricted diet, supplemented with protein substitutes (PSs), remains the cornerstone of phenylketonuria (PKU) management. However, adherence is challenging in adulthood, and data on the nutritional status of early and continuously treated adults with PKU (ETAwPKU) are scarce. A total of 34 ETAwPKU (16 females; mean ± SD, age: 28 ± 9 years, phenylalanine concentration: 847 ± 285 µmol/L) and 34 age- and sex-matched control subjects were compared regarding their blood nutrient status, self-reported dietary intake, and cognitive wellbeing. Though diet adherence varied, all ETAwPKU were taking a PS. No significant differences were found for blood DHA, calcium, ferritin, transferrin, and zinc concentrations. However, selenium and ubiquinone concentrations were 16% and 29% lower in ETAwPKU, respectively (<i>p</i> < 0.01 and <0.0001). Vitamin concentrations (D, B12, B6, and folic acid) were significantly higher in ETAwPKU except for alpha-tocopherol. Amino acid (AA) concentrations differed between ETAwPKU and controls: they were significantly lower for 12 AAs and higher for phenylalanine and glycine. ETAwPKU had a significantly higher intake of most minerals and vitamins, except for niacin and phosphorus (no difference). Depending on the nutrient, PSs represented 52-100% of patients' daily intake and 19% of total daily energy intake. Compared with controls, ETAwPKU scored significantly lower in three of the four subscales of the cognitive wellbeing questionnaire. Overall, the blood DHA and micronutrient status of ETAwPKU was adequate, except for selenium, with higher intakes than controls for most micronutrients. Patients relied heavily on PSs to meet the recommended intakes for protein, DHA, and micronutrients. The potential clinical impact of differences found in AA status should be further studied."

    "abstract": "There are more than 1100 different pathogenic variants in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (<i>PAH</i>) gene that are responsible for phenylketonuria (PKU) diseases, and the spectrum of these mutations varies in different ethnic groups. The aim of the present study was to identify the frequency of pathogenic variants in all 13 exons of the <i>PAH</i> gene among patients with PKU in Mazandaran and Golestan provinces in the north of Iran. Forty unrelated PKU patients from Mazandaran and Golestan provinces were enrolled in the study. Genomic DNA was extracted from leukocytes using a Qiagen DNA extraction kit and polymerase chain reaction - restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP), and Sanger sequencing methods were applied to detect the variants. In the case of new variants, the InterVar online tool (PMID: 28132688) was used to classify the variants. Twenty-one different pathogenic variants were observed among the 40 investigated patients. The c.106611G>A variant had the highest frequency (27.5%) in the region, and the c.168+5G>C, c.473G>A, and c.782 G>A variants were the other most frequent mutations with allelic frequencies of 7.5, 5, and 5%, respectively. Three novel pathogenic variants including c.773T>G, c.878 T>C, and c. 1245del variants were observed among the investigated patients. The introduction of pathogenic variants in the <i>PAH</i> gene in each ethnic group provides valuable data regarding the understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease and can be helpful for prenatal diagnosis programs."

    "title": "Patient and carer perceptions of video, telephone and in-person clinics for Phenylketonuria (PKU).",
    "abstract": "In phenylketonuria (PKU), attending multidisciplinary clinic reviews is an important aspect of life-long care. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, video and telephone clinics are used as alternative methods for people with PKU to have contact with their care team. There is limited research concerning patient preference, experience and perceptions of alternative types of clinic review. Individuals from the UK with PKU and their caregivers were invited to complete an online questionnaire, hosted on the National Society for PKU (NSPKU) website and social media platform. Data was available from 203 respondents. Forty one per cent of respondents (n = 49/119) preferred in-person clinics; 41% (n = 49) a hybrid of in-person, video and telephone clinics; 9% (n = 11) video clinics only, 6% (n = 7) telephone only and 3% (n = 3) were unsure. The main respondent obstacles to in-person clinics were costs, travel and time, but this was balanced by the benefits of a physical examination and better patient engagement/motivation. Twenty one per cent (n = 36/169) of respondents were uncomfortable with the number of healthcare professionals (HCPs) in a clinic room. Patients were less likely to consult with a doctor on video (64%, n = 91/143) or phone (50%, n = 59/119) reviews compared to in-person (80%, n = 146/183). Issues with video and telephone reviews included the shorter time length of review, distractions, technical issues and poor patient engagement. Online video and telephone clinic platforms were effective in overcoming the challenging circumstances in management, monitoring and treatment of patients with PKU during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, in-person clinics remain the preferred respondent option. It is important that HCPs are flexible, enabling people with PKU a choice of clinic options according to their individual clinical need and circumstances."

    "abstract": "The clinical performance of RHDO-based NIPD for PKU during early gestation remains under-evaluated. Furthermore, studies focused on SNP loci obtained by next-generation sequencing to analyze the genetic evolution of pathogenic variations in PKU is limited. Maternal peripheral blood, along with proband and paternal samples, was collected between 7 and 12 weeks of gestation. The PAH gene and surrounding high heterozygosity SNPs were targeted for enrichment and sequencing. Fetal genotypes were inferred using RHDO-based NIPD. High-resolution PAH haplotypes were used for the analysis of two common pathogenic variants in the Chinese population: c.728G>A and c.1238G>C. Sixty one PKU families participated with an average fetal fraction of 6.08%. The median gestational age was 8<sup>+6</sup> weeks. RHDO-based NIPD successfully identified fetal genotypes in 59 cases (96.72%, 59/62). Two cases failed because of insufficient informative SNPs. In addition, a recombination event was assessed in one fetus of 59 cases. Six, and three haplotypes were identified for c.728G>A(p.Arg243Gln) and c.1238G>C(p.Arg413Pro), respectively. Hap_3 and hap_8 were identified as the ancestral haplotypes for these pathogenic variants, with other haplotypes arising from mutations or recombination based on these ancestral haplotypes. This study validates the feasibility of an RHDO-based assay for NIPD of PKU in early pregnancy and introduces its application in the demonstration of founder effects in recurrent pathogenic variations, offering new insights into the evolutionary analysis of PAH variations."

    "title": "Effect of a four-week oral Phe administration on neural activation and cerebral blood flow in adults with early-treated phenylketonuria.",
    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a rare inborn error of metabolism characterized by impaired catabolism of the amino acid phenylalanine (Phe) into tyrosine. Cross-sectional studies suggest slight alterations in cognitive performance and neural activation in adults with early-treated PKU. The influence of high Phe levels on brain function in adulthood, however, remains insufficiently studied. Therefore, we aimed to explore the effect of a four-week period of oral Phe administration - simulating a controlled discontinuation of Phe restriction and raising Phe to an off-diet scenario - on working memory-related neural activation and cerebral blood flow (CBF). We conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover, non-inferiority trial to assess the effect of a high Phe load on working memory-related neural activation and CBF in early-treated adults with classical PKU. Twenty-seven patients with early-treated classical PKU were included and underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of the working memory network and arterial spin labeling (ASL) MRI to assess CBF before and after a four-week intervention with Phe and placebo. At each of the four study visits, fMRI working memory task performance (reaction time and accuracy) and plasma Phe, tyrosine, and tryptophan levels were obtained. Additionally, cerebral Phe was determined by <sup>1</sup>H-MR spectroscopy. Plasma Phe and cerebral Phe were significantly increased after the Phe intervention. However, no significant effect of Phe compared to placebo was found on neural activation and CBF. Regarding fMRI task performance, a significant impact of the Phe intervention on 1-back reaction time was observed with slower reaction times following the Phe intervention, whereas 3-back reaction time and accuracy did not differ following the Phe intervention compared to the placebo intervention. Results from this present trial simulating a four-week discontinuation of the Phe-restricted diet showed that a high Phe load did not uniformly affect neural markers and cognition in a statistically significant manner. These results further contribute to the discussion on safe Phe levels during adulthood and suggest that a four-week discontinuation of Phe-restricted diet does not demonstrate significant changes in brain function."

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an inborn error of phenylalanine (Phe) metabolism that, if untreated, causes Phe accumulation in the brain leading to neurophysiologic alterations and poor outcomes. Lifelong management centers on dietary Phe restriction, yet long-term complete metabolic control is unachievable for many adults. High blood Phe levels or chronic Phe and intact protein restriction in the diet may lead to somatic comorbidities. A systematic literature review was conducted to evaluate somatic comorbidities experienced by adults with PKU. Clinical and observational studies reporting somatic comorbidities experienced by individuals with PKU aged ≥ 16 years (or classified as adults) evaluating a Phe-restricted diet with or without pharmacologic therapy versus no therapeutic intervention (including healthy controls), or pharmacologic therapy versus a Phe-restricted diet alone, were identified. PubMed® was searched (February 1, 2022 and updated November 1, 2023), using a pre-defined search strategy, followed by two-stage screening and data extraction. Included studies were grouped by PKU population comparison. 1185 records were screened; 51 studies across 12,602 individuals were extracted. Bone-related abnormalities were the most reported outcome (n = 21); several outcome measures were used. Original study groupings included: Phe-restricted diet versus healthy controls or reference values (n = 40); treatment-adherent versus those non-adherent (n = 12). Additional groups added as part of a protocol amendment included: different Phe-restricted diets (n = 4); severe versus less severe disease (n = 5). Vote counting indicated a higher burden of ≥ 1 comorbidity (or outcome measure) for the Phe-restricted diet group by 37 of 38 studies included in the analysis of Phe-restricted diet versus healthy controls; higher burden in healthy controls was reported in 12 studies. Vote counting was similar between those treatment adherent (n = 7) versus non-adherent (n = 10). Adults with PKU have a higher comorbidity burden than a non-PKU population. More robust studies are needed to better understand the relationship between effective metabolic control and comorbidity burden, using consistent outcome measures. This SLR was supported by BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc., Novato, CA, and is registered with the Research Registry (reviewregistry1476)."

    "abstract": "Unlocking the potential of routine medical data for clinical research requires the analysis of data from multiple healthcare institutions. However, according to German data protection regulations, data can often not leave the individual institutions and decentralized approaches are needed. Decentralized studies face challenges regarding coordination, technical infrastructure, interoperability and regulatory compliance. Rare diseases are an important prototype research focus for decentralized data analyses, as patients are rare by definition and adequate cohort sizes can only be reached if data from multiple sites is combined. Within the project \"Collaboration on Rare Diseases\", decentralized studies focusing on four rare diseases (cystic fibrosis, phenylketonuria, Kawasaki disease, multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children) were conducted at 17 German university hospitals. Therefore, a data management process for decentralized studies was developed by an interdisciplinary team of experts from medicine, public health and data science. Along the process, lessons learned were formulated and discussed. The process consists of eight steps and includes sub-processes for the definition of medical use cases, script development and data management. The lessons learned include on the one hand the organization and administration of the studies (collaboration of experts, use of standardized forms and publication of project information), and on the other hand the development of scripts and analysis (dependency on the database, use of standards and open source tools, feedback loops, anonymization). This work captures central challenges and describes possible solutions and can hence serve as a solid basis for the implementation and conduction of similar decentralized studies."

    "abstract": "In addition to the numerous immunological and nutritional benefits that breast milk offers to infants, its proportion in the diet must be limited or even excluded in the case of inborn errors of amino acid metabolism (IEM). The objective of the study was to expand knowledge about breastfeeding and the degree of contribution of breast milk to the feeding of infants with IEM before and after the introduction of expanded newborn screening. A retrospective single-centre study was conducted on 127 infants born between 1997 and 2020: 66 with phenylketonuria (PKU), 45 with other IEM (non-PKU), all diagnosed through newborn screening (NBS), and 16 non-PKU diagnosed through selective screening (SS). The time of initiation of dietary treatment and the proportion of breast milk in the diet, both expressed and breastfed, with or without intake control, were analysed at 1, 3, and 6 months after birth. For 47% of the newborns in Groups 1 and 2, the dietary treatment was started before the 10th day of life; in Group 3, the dietary treatment was started after the 10th day of life for all children. During the first month of life, the proportion of infants receiving breast milk was higher in the NBS-PKU (74%) and the NBS non-PKU (80%) groups, compared with 38% in the SS non-PKU infants. In the subsequent months of life, the proportion of infants receiving human milk (either from the breast or a bottle) declined in all groups. This decline occurred more in bottle-fed rather than directly breast-fed infants. Our observations indicate that the model of feeding from a bottle with expressed milk may have had an adverse effect on maintaining lactation and may have contributed to a faster transition to formula milk. Maintaining lactation and extending the period of feeding the infant with human milk in the first 6 months of life is possible by breastfeeding on demand, under regular biochemical monitoring: preferably weekly in PKU infants, and at least every 2-4 weeks in infants with other IEM."

    "abstract": "<b>Background</b>: Caregiving experiences in rare diseases (RDs) vary based on factors such as specific clinical entity, disease severity, the child's age, and available support and resources, leading to challenges that significantly impact caregivers' lives. This study investigates whether caregivers of children with different RDs encounter varied aspects of care. <b>Methods</b>: This study was conducted as a self-administered, anonymous, computer-assisted online survey, focusing on the challenges of caregiving for children with RDs. Questions covered aspects such as information availability on RDs, diagnostic processes, modern treatment accessibility, family physicians and specialists, the impact of caregiving on personal life, family dynamics, and financial challenges. To achieve our study objectives, we categorized caregivers of children with RDs into two groups to compare various aspects of caregiving: caregivers of children with phenylketonuria (PKU) (<i>n</i> = 175) and those caring for children with life-limiting rare diseases (LLRD) (<i>n</i> = 226). <b>Results:</b> Caregivers of children with LLRD reported greater emotional challenges, personal sacrifices, and financial burdens compared to caregivers of children with PKU. Significant differences included heightened emotional distress, more frequent conflicts, and lower assessments of healthcare support among LLRD caregivers. Although family support ratings were similar between the groups, perceptions of financial concerns and interactions with the healthcare system varied significantly. <b>Conclusions</b>: This study, representing the inaugural systematic comparison of specific caregiver cohorts overseeing children with RDs across a substantial sample size, provides valuable insights. The findings lay a crucial foundation for precisely tailoring assistance and support initiatives to meet the unique needs of caregivers facing various RDs in diverse contexts."

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a rare metabolic condition characterised by an inability to metabolise phenylalanine (Phe), found in many foods. When pregnant with PKU, women must adhere to a strict low-Phe diet. If they do not, foetal abnormalities or pregnancy loss can occur. Pregnancies are therefore closely clinically monitored and dominated by dietary management, leaving little \"space\" for women's emotional experience. This article explores the emotional impact of PKU during pregnancy and how this effects pre-natal bonding. Based on interviews with six women with PKU, conducted whilst they were pregnant, this article explores their unusual and previously undocumented experience. Image-making during interviews allowed women to uncover aspects of their experience that might otherwise have remained hidden. Interpretative phenomenological analysis of the transcripts and images generated five themes summarising the women's experiences. Some themes reiterated findings from previous studies, for example, the huge cognitive burden associated with PKU pregnancies and the importance of both expert and informal support to successful pregnancy management. However, new understanding also emerged, including rich description of the emotional load of these pregnancies and strategies that women use to manage this. Anxiety about baby safety was central to their experiences, and the effect of this on pre-natal bonding was explored. This article calls for increased formal and informal support for women with the emotional aspects of their PKU pregnancies, for example, the creation of \"attachment-aware\" services that support women with their anxiety, promoting strong pre-natal attachment and subsequently protecting maternal and infant mental health throughout pregnancy and beyond."

However, there has been no report on case who suffering from both diseases simultaneously. SMA mainly affects the motor function while PKU may have an impact on both the intelligence and motor function. But if only 1 disease is treated while neglecting the other, the treatment effect will be compromised. Here, for the first time, we report a case from China diagnosed with both these diseases and treated properly. A boy was admitted to the Children's Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University (Jinan, China) due to \"limb weakness for 19 months\" when he was 22 months old. Considering that the child's motor function development is delayed, we made a comprehensive examinations including inherited metabolic diseases and found a significantly increase of phenylalanine concentration in the blood which indicating PKU. Combined with his typical clinical manifestations of SMA, target capture sequencing followed by Sanger sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) technologies were used for genetic confirmation. SMA and PKU was confirmed. The child was treated with risdiplam and low phenylalanine formula immediately when he was diagnosed with both SMA and PKU. The child showed remarkable improvement in motor function and significant decrease of blood phenylalanine concentration after treatment. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of SMA combined with PKU. This case expands our understanding of diagnosis for synchronous SMA and PKU and highlights the importance of comprehensive examinations and the utilizing of various genetic testing methods to make an accurate diagnosis of genetic diseases, which may help avoiding the progressive damage caused by certain genetic disease with insidious clinical symptoms."

    "title": "Are Carriers Unaffected? A Literature Review of Metabolic and Health Outcomes among Genetic Carriers of Phenylketonuria.",
    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an autosomal recessive genetic condition that results in reduced enzymatic functioning within the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) pathway, which is involved in the metabolism of phenylalanine (Phe) into tyrosine (Tyr). Without dietary intervention, individuals with PKU exhibit significantly elevated levels of Phe, which is presumed to cause severe neurological dysfunction and other associated health risks. Carriers of PKU are heterozygotes for a PAH gene mutation and are typically described in the literature as \"unaffected.\" However, decades of existing research challenges this classical thinking and it is plausible that these individuals currently classified as carriers may present with an intermediate phenotype or may be \"moderately affected.\" The purpose of this scoping review was to explore this hypothesis further, by searching for and summarizing existing literature on metabolism and health outcomes among PKU carriers. Preliminary research has suggested that some PKU carriers exhibit reduced PAH enzyme function, and relatedly, elevated circulating Phe levels compared to noncarriers. In addition, Phe dosing trials have further demonstrated that carriers have increased Phe levels and decreased Tyr levels compared to noncarriers. Because of these metabolic perturbations, it is biologically plausible for carriers to experience an intermediate phenotype in terms of metabolic consequences and clinical outcomes. While these outcomes have yet to be thoroughly explored, early research has found associations between PKU carrier status and lower IQs as well as decreased executive functioning, memory, processing speed, and inhibitory control. The PAH pathway is also involved in melanogenesis, and research has demonstrated increased melanoma risk among PKU carriers. However, there are many limitations to this research, and thus whether or not carriers are clinically impacted cannot yet be conclusively determined. Overall, while preliminary research suggests a possible intermediate phenotype among PKU carriers, the current available research is limited and PKU carriers are still clinically considered \"unaffected.\" This review outlines the current literature while discussing future research endeavors related to the metabolism and health of PKU carriers."

Twenty-five children (12 males, 48%) with a median age of 3.6 years (2.0-6.2 years) were included. During 24 months follow-up, children maintained normal growth and satisfactory metabolic control. The protein intake from protein substitutes increased from 2.7 at 6 months to 2.8 g/kg/day at 24 months, while natural protein decreased from 0.6 to 0.4 g/kg/day. By 24 months, most children (n = 16, 64%) had stopped PFIF, while nine (36%) continued with a median intake of 450 mL/day (Q1:300 mL, Q3: 560 mL). Children who continued PFIF after 24 months of age had higher energy and fat intakes with higher weight/BMI z-scores compared with those who stopped earlier (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Constipation was reported in 44% of infants but improved with age. Initial difficulty with PFIF acceptance was reported in 20% of infants but also improved with time. Prolonged use of PFIF in pre-school children may contribute to poor feeding patterns and overweight; thus, replacing the majority of the protein equivalent provided by PFIF with a weaning protein substitute by 12 months and discontinuing PFIF before 2 years is recommended."

However, the impact of metabolic control in various stages of development on more complex cognitive abilities, i.e. executive functions (EF), is still unclear. EFs were tested in 28 patients with PKU/mHPA, aged 8-17 years, identified by newborn screening and continuously treated. The relation to current (testing day & past 10 phenylalanine (Phe) values) and long-term metabolic control (age periods: childhood <6, 6-10, adolescence >10 years, lifetime Phe) was analyzed. EFs were in the lower normative range (IQR of T-values: 47.35-51.00). Patients reaction time was significantly slower than the population mean (divided attention/TAP: median 40, p < 0.01). Both, long-term and current metabolic control correlated with performance in EF tests: Higher current Phe impaired reaction times (Go/No-Go, r = -0.387; working memory, r = -0.425; p < 0.05) and performance in planning ability (ToL r = -0.465, p < 0.01). Higher long-term Phe values both in childhood and adolescence mainly affected attention (omissions/TAP r = -0.357 and - 0.490, respectively, both p < 0.05) as well as planning ability (ToL r = -0.422 and - 0.387, adolescence and lifetime, p < 0.05). Current and long-term metabolic control in PKU/mHPA, including the adolescent period, influence EFs, especially affecting reaction time and planning abilities.

Therefore, our objective was to assess amino acids in serum samples from 20 PKU patients and compare them with results from 51 healthy subjects. A sample analysis was conducted using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. We obtained levels of 28 substances, including amino acids, biogenic amines, carnitine, and acetylcarnitine. Kynurenine (<i>p</i> = 0.000001), tyrosine (<i>p</i> = 0.0002), asparagine (<i>p</i> = 0.001), proline (<i>p</i> = 0.012), and the kynurenine/tryptophan ratio (<i>p</i> < 0.000001) were identified as features that differed between the studied groups, being significantly lower in patients with PKU. Glycine (<i>p</i> = 0.000012), putrescine (<i>p</i> = 0.0055), asymmetric dimethylarginine (<i>p</i> = 0.01), creatinine (<i>p</i> = 0.035) levels, as well as the total level of glucogenic amino acids (<i>p</i> = 0.0018), and the ratios of putrescine/ornithine (<i>p</i> = 0.003) and citrulline/ornithine (<i>p</i> = 0.0043) were significantly higher in the PKU group. In conclusion, the amino acid profiles in patients with PKU differ significantly from those in healthy peers, with potential clinical implications. These findings confirm the importance of metabolic testing in clinical practice and highlight the necessity for adequate dietary monitoring and adjustment."

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an autosomal recessive inborn error of phenylalanine (Phe) metabolism, resulting from the deficient activity of phenylalanine hydroxylase that converts Phe to tyrosine in the liver, leading to elevated levels of Phe. Pegvaliase is an innovative and effective enzyme replacement therapy for reducing Phe concentration, but it has been associated with severe drug-induced hypersensitivity adverse events (HAEs). Limited data is available on the management of these HAEs, thus, we aimed to present a case report of a successful management strategy. The patient was a 28-year-old Caucasian male with classical PKU, who was otherwise healthy. Due to poor metabolic control, the pegvaliase treatment was initiated. The titration phase was uneventful, with transient and mild side effects, localized to the injection site. After the patient was on a maintenance dose of pegvaliase and had no reactions to the drug, we discontinued the H1-antihistamine. In the following days, within minutes after receiving the pegvaliase injection, an acute hypersensitivity reaction occurred that required emergency treatment. H1-antihistamine treatment was reintroduced. Four days after the incident he received pegvaliase under medical supervision and did not experience any symptoms. In conclusion, cautious reintroduction of pegvaliase in a hospital setting can be safely performed after HAE due to the discontinuation of H1-antihistamines. HAEs could be successfully mitigated by scheduling daily antihistamines administration closer to the pegvaliase injection. This approach can enable PKU patients to maintain their access to an effective and quality-of-life-improving therapy."

    "title": "New findings about neuropathological outcomes in the PKU mouse throughout lifespan.",
    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU, OMIM 261600) is a genetic disorder caused by a deficiency of the hepatic enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH). If left untreated, PKU leads to systemic phenylalanine (Phe) accumulation, which can result in irreversible brain damage and intellectual disabilities. In the last 60 years, early and strict dietary restriction of phenylalanine (Phe) intake proved to prevent the severe clinical phenotype of untreated PKU. While the specific mechanisms through which phenylalanine causes brain damage are still poorly understood, preclinical models have been deeply explored to characterize the neurotoxic effect of Phe on neurodevelopmental processes. At the same time, that on the aging brain still needs to be explored. In the brain of untreated PAH<sup>Enu2(-/-)</sup> mouse, we previously reported a reduction of myelin basic protein (MBP) during postnatal development up to 60 PND. Later in the diseased mouse's life, a spontaneous and persistent restoration of MBP was detected. In this present longitudinal study, ranging from 14 to 540 post-natal days (PND) of untreated PAH<sup>Enu2(-/-)</sup> mice, we further investigated: a) the long-life consistency of two Phe-related brain metabolic alterations, such as large neutral amino acids (LNAA) and biogenic amine neurotransmitters' depletion; b) the outcome of locomotor functions during the same life span; c) the integrity of myelin as assessed ex vivo by central (hippocampus) and peripheral (extensor digitorum longus-sciatic nerve) action potential conduction velocities. In contrast with the results of other studies, brain Leu, Ile, and Val concentrations were not significantly altered in the brain PAH<sup>Enu2(-/-)</sup> mouse. On the other hand, 3-O-Methyldopa (3-OMD, a biomarker of L-DOPA), serotonin, and its associated metabolites were reduced throughout most of the considered time points, with consistent reductions observed prevalently from 14 to 60 PND. Normal saltatory conduction was restored after 60 PND and remained normal at the last examination at 360 PND, resulting nonetheless in a persistent locomotor impairment throughout a lifetime. These new findings contribute to laying the foundations for the preclinical characterization of aging in PKU, confirming neurotransmitter defects as consistent metabolic traits. LNAAs have a minor role, if any, in brain damage pathogenesis. Transient myelin synthesis failure may impact brain connectivity during postnatal development but not nervous signal conduction."

    "abstract": "This study aims to determine the allele and genotype frequency, evaluate genotype-phenotype correlation and contribute to the spectrum of pathogenic variants in the PAH gene. Ninety-three individuals diagnosed with PKU were included in the study. Next-generation sequencing was utilized for detecting variants in the PAH gene. Copy Number Variations in patients without biallelic pathogenic variant were investigated by Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification method. Genotype-phenotype correlations and genotype-based phenotype predictions were examined by comparing molecular test results with BIOPKUdb database. The clinical distributions of the patients were as follows: classic PKU 21% (n = 19), mild PKU 3% (n = 3), and mild hyperphenylalaninemia 76% (n = 71), respectively. Thirty-nine distinct variants and 70 distinct genotypes were found in patients. The most frequently observed variant was p.(Ala300Ser) (13.9%) and the most frequently observed genotype was p.[Ala300Ser];[Ala300Ser] (5.6%). Compound heterozygous genotypes (%69) were more prevalent than homozygous genotypes. A novel variant, c.441+4A>C, was observed. Predicted metabolic phenotypes in the database showed consistency with patient phenotypes (n = 33/41). BH4 responsiveness showed partial consistency with database predictions (n = 13/25). Establishing genotype-phenotype correlations can facilitate personalized management approaches. Overall, this study contributes to understanding the genetic basis and clinical course of PKU."

    "title": "Pre-analytic decrease of phenylalanine in plasma of patients with phenylketonuria treated with pegvaliase.",
    "abstract": "Treatment of phenylketonuria (PKU) has evolved since the initial introduction of a phenylalanine (Phe) restricted diet. The most recent option for adults affected with PKU is treatment with an alternate enzyme, phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), that metabolizes excess Phe. Proper management of all patients with PKU relies on accurate measurement of Phe levels in blood, to comply with guidance intended to minimize the neurological symptoms. Recently, our laboratory was notified of discrepant results for a patient with PKU who is treated with pegvaliase. Two specimens were collected at the same time but yielded unexpectedly different Phe concentrations. After exclusion of specimen mix-ups or analytical errors, we suspected that there was residual pegvaliase activity in the specimens continuing to degrade Phe after collection. To investigate this possibility, we performed spiking studies that showed the degradation of Phe over time at ambient temperatures. Sample preparation by protein crash appears to deactivate pegvaliase and prevents further Phe degradation. However, because pegvaliase deactivation would be required immediately following blood collection, appropriate mitigation measures must be implemented, including stringent pre-analytical requirements, alternate sample matrices such as dried blood spots, or point of care testing. Until then, health care professionals need to be cautious in their interpretation of Phe levels in their patients with PKU that are treated with pegvaliase."

    "abstract": "Patients with phenylketonuria (PKU) present signs of impaired executive functioning and bone health in adolescence and adulthood, depending in part on the success of therapy in childhood. Therefore, nine children with well-treated PKU (4-7 years old, 22.2% ♀, seven with a full set of data, two included into partial analysis) and 18 age-, gender- and season-matched controls were analyzed for differences in executive functioning and bone parameters in plasma. Plasma was analyzed with commercially available kits. Cognitive performance in tonic alertness, visuo-spatial working memory, inhibitory control and task switching was assessed by a task battery presented on a touch screen. Regarding cognition, only the performance in incongruent conditions in inhibitory control was significantly better in children with PKU than in controls. No further differences in cognitive tests were detected. Furthermore, no significant difference in the bone turnover markers osteocalcin, undercarboxylated osteocalcin and CTX were detected between children with PKU and controls, while children with PKU had a significantly higher vitamin D concentration (69.44 ± 12.83 nmol/L vs. 41.87 ± 15.99 nmol/L, <i>p</i> < 0.001) and trended towards lower parathyroid hormone concentrations than controls (48.27 ± 15.16 pg/mL vs. 70.61 ± 30.53 pg/mL, <i>p</i> = 0.066). In this small group of well-treated preschoolers with PKU, no impairments in cognitive performance and bone turnover were observed, while vitamin D supplementation of amino acid supplements seems to be sufficient to achieve good vitamin D status."

    "title": "Blood Phenylalanine Levels in Patients with Phenylketonuria from Europe between 2012 and 2018: Is It a Changing Landscape?",
    "abstract": "In 2011, a European phenylketonuria (PKU) survey reported that the blood phenylalanine (Phe) levels were well controlled in early life but deteriorated with age. Other studies have shown similar results across the globe. Different target blood Phe levels have been used throughout the years, and, in 2017, the European PKU guidelines defined new targets for blood Phe levels. This study aimed to evaluate blood Phe control in patients with PKU across Europe. nine centres managing PKU in Europe and Turkey participated. Data were collected retrospectively from medical and dietetic records between 2012 and 2018 on blood Phe levels, PKU severity, and medications. A total of 1323 patients (age range:1-57, 51% male) participated. Patient numbers ranged from 59 to 320 in each centre. The most common phenotype was classical PKU (<i>n</i> = 625, 48%), followed by mild PKU (<i>n</i> = 357, 27%) and hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA) (<i>n</i> = 325, 25%). The mean percentage of blood Phe levels within the target range ranged from 65 ± 54% to 88 ± 49% for all centres. The percentage of Phe levels within the target range declined with increasing age (<2 years: 89%; 2-5 years: 84%; 6-12 years: 73%; 13-18 years: 85%; 19-30 years: 64%; 31-40 years: 59%; and ≥41 years: 40%). The mean blood Phe levels were significantly lower and the percentage within the target range was significantly higher (<i>p</i> < 0.001) in patients with HPA (290 ± 325 μmol/L; 96 ± 24%) and mild PKU (365 ± 224 μmol/L; 77 ± 36%) compared to classical PKU (458 ± 350 μmol/L, 54 ± 46%). There was no difference between males and females in the mean blood Phe levels (<i>p</i> = 0.939), but the percentage of Phe levels within the target range was higher in females among school-age children (6-12 years; 83% in females vs. 78% in males; <i>p</i> = 0.005), adolescents (13-18 years; 62% in females vs. 59% in males; <i>p</i> = 0.034) and adults (31-40 years; 65% in females vs. 41% in males; <i>p</i> < 0.001 and >41 years; 43% in females vs. 28% in males; <i>p</i> < 0.001). Patients treated with sapropterin (<i>n</i> = 222) had statistically significantly lower Phe levels compared to diet-only-treated patients (mean 391 ± 334 μmol/L; percentage within target 84 ± 39% vs. 406 ± 334 μmol/L; 73 ± 41%; <i>p</i> < 0.001), although a blood Phe mean difference of 15 µmol/L may not be clinically relevant. An increased frequency of blood Phe monitoring was associated with better metabolic control (<i>p</i> < 0.05). The mean blood Phe (% Phe levels within target) from blood Phe samples collected weekly was 271 ± 204 μmol/L, (81 ± 33%); for once every 2 weeks, it was 376 ± 262 μmol/L, (78 ± 42%); for once every 4 weeks, it was 426 ± 282 μmol/L, (71 ± 50%); and less than monthly samples, it was 534 ± 468 μmol/L, (70 ± 58%). Overall, blood Phe control deteriorated with age. A higher frequency of blood sampling was associated with better blood Phe control with less variability. The severity of PKU and the available treatments and resources may impact the blood Phe control achieved by each treatment centre."

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder resulting from phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency, which impacts neurodevelopment. Lifelong low-phenylalanine diets and multidisciplinary care are pivotal for managing PKU. Latin American challenges in PKU care include diverse newborn screening programs, limited specialized healthcare, and resource scarcity. A systematic literature review was conducted (2010-2023) on PKU management following PRISMA guidelines. Inclusion criteria encompassed English/Spanish articles focusing on PKU management guidelines approved by an organization as well as articles focusing on PKU management in Latin America. After screening 127,276 results, 6 articles were included. Six articles were analyzed, highlighting shared principles like multidisciplinary care, lifelong dietary adherence, personalized plans, and regular monitoring. Guides emphasized regional variations, breastfeeding complexities, and challenges for pregnant women with PKU. Multidisciplinary care emerges as critical, incorporating physicians, psychologists, dietitians, nurses, and genetic counselors. Lifelong adherence to low-phenylalanine diets and personalized strategies for different life stages are emphasized. Challenges in Latin America include healthcare gaps, scarce resources, and reliance on international guidance. The importance of breastfeeding, preconception care, and comprehensive support for pregnant women with PKU is underscored. Collaborative efforts are essential to address PKU challenges in Latin America. Advocacy for awareness, specialized training, regional databases, and international collaborations can enhance diagnosis and management, ensuring a better quality of life for PKU individuals in the region. Embracing lessons from existing guides will contribute to improved PKU care and overall well-being."

    "abstract": "To investigate the epidemiological characteristics and mutation spectrum of monogenic diseases in Chinese population through a large-scale, multicenter carrier screening. This study was conducted among a total of 33 104 participants (16 610 females) from 12 clinical centers across China.Carrier status for 223 genes was analyzed using high-throughput sequencing and different PCR methods. The overall combined carrier frequency was 55.58% for 197 autosomal genes and 1.84% for 26 X-linked genes in these participants.Among the 16 669 families, 874 at-risk couples (5.24%) were identified.Specifically, 584 couples (3.50%) were at risk for autosomal genes, 306(1.84%) for X-linked genes, and 16 for both autosomal and X-linked genes.The most frequently detected autosomal at-risk genes included GJB2(autosomal recessive deafness type 1A, 393 couples), HBA1/HBA2(α-thalassemia, 36 couples), PAH (phenylketonuria, 14 couples), and SMN1(spinal muscular atrophy, 14 couples).The most frequently detected X-linked at-risk genes were G6PD (G6PD deficiency, 236 couples), DMD (Duchenne muscular dystrophy, 23 couples), and FMR1(fragile X syndrome, 17 couples).After excluding GJB2 c.109G>A, the detection rate of at-risk couples was 3.91%(651/16 669), which was lowered to 1.72%(287/16 669) after further excluding G6PD.The theoretical incidence rate of severe monogenic birth defects was approximately 4.35‰(72.5/16 669).Screening for a battery of the top 22 most frequent genes in the at-risk couples could detect over 95% of at-risk couples, while screening for the top 54 genes further increased the detection rate to over 99%. This study reveals the carrier frequencies of 223 monogenic genetic disorders in the Chinese population and provides evidence for carrier screening strategy development and panel design tailored to the Chinese population.In carrier testing, genetic counseling for specific genes or gene variants can be challenging, and the couples need to be informed of these difficulties before testing and provided with options for not screening these genes or gene variants."

    "abstract": "To compare radial peripapillary capillary (RPC) vascular plexus parameters and peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL) thickness between Early-Treated Adults with Phenylketonuria (ETPKU) and controls. This observational study was a monocentric, case control study including 36 eyes of 36 participants. Among these, 18 were early-treated PKU (ETPKU) and 18 were controls. A SD-OCTA (XR Avanti AngioVue OCTA; Optovue Inc., Fremont, CA) was employed to assess the OCT and OCTA parameters of all the participants. The main outcome measures were the RPC vessels density (VD) %, and the pRNFL thickness. The average pRNFL thickness was significantly reduced in ETPKU (110.78 ± 12.48 μm) compared to controls (113.22 ± 13.95 μm), <i>p</i> = 0.046. The mean VD% of the small vessels of the RPC plexus was 52.31 ± 2.2 in ETPKU and 50.71 ± 3.2 in controls (<i>p</i> = 0.049), while the VD% of all the radial peripapillary capillary plexus (RPCP) was 58.5 ± 2.2 in ETPKU and 55.08 ± 3.4 in controls (<i>p</i> < 0.001). By contrast, there were no differences in age, sex, and IOP between the two groups. Through structural OCT and OCTA, we observed thinning of the nerve fibers accompanied by an increase in perfusion of the RPC plexus. Thus, our conclusions suggest that OCTA may serve as a noninvasive method to identify novel retinal biomarkers in ETPKU."

    "abstract": "Those diagnosed with PKU in the early years of newborn screening (NBS) were often discharged from clinic in childhood. Long-term lost to clinic patients may be impacted by untreated PKU and uninformed about current recommendations. We aimed to contact adults away from clinic for 5-50+ years, share current recommendations, offer clinical care, and elicit factors underlying not returning to clinic. Former patients were identified and offered a virtual meeting with a physician and dietitian for structured interview and education about current guidelines and treatments. We identified 53 eligible patients who had PKU and had not returned to clinic in ≥5 years. Of those 53, 27 were successfully contacted, 16 completed the educational intervention, and 5/16 returned to clinic. Reasons for having been away from clinic included discharge from clinic in childhood and inadequate insurance coverage. Experiences varied and some denied negative impacts after diet discontinuation. Individuals expressed a desire for convenient treatments that aligned with overall health goals. Most participants who completed the educational intervention expressed interest in returning to clinic; however, most did not return within the timeframe of the project. All 27 individuals successfully contacted agreed to be re-contacted with future updates or research opportunities. We successfully contacted half of individuals identified as having been lost to clinic follow-up long-term. Limitations included inability to make initial contact, and unwillingness to re-engage by some we reached. Those who agreed to participation desired ongoing PKU clinic and community connection. This experience will inform our process to engage current patients and re-engage those currently lost to care."

The study was conducted between 10.02.2021-10.03.2021 with 147 healthcare workers working in heel prick screening in health institutions where heel prick blood samples were collected in a province and districts in the Central Anatolia region of Turkey. As a data collection tool, a questionnaire prepared by the researcher in line with the literature was used. The data were evaluated by number, percentage, mean and standard deviation analysis and chi-square analysis was performed in IBM SPSS for Windows 29.0v programme. The majority of healthcare professionals gave correct answers to the questions regarding the collection, storage and transfer of heel prick. It has been observed that healthcare professionals do not have sufficient information regarding the definition of Congenital Metabolic Diseases, their findings and where to refer patients whose results are suspicious.The most significance was found in the distribution of answers regarding the symptoms of the screened diseases according to occupational groups. In diseases that can be controlled with treatment and nutrition if detected early, errors in the collection, storage and transport of the sample can affect the test result and delay the diagnosis. Healthcare professionals have important responsibilities issues from genetic counseling before marriage, taking heel blood, from informing the family to caring for the diagnosed baby. This study will provide valuable information to health professionals involved in newborn screening and to future studies in this field."

    "abstract": "Morphofunctional assessment was developed to evaluate disease-related malnutrition. However, it can also be used to assess cardiometabolic risk, as excess adiposity increases this risk. Phenylketonuria (PKU) is the most prevalent inherited metabolic disease among adults, and obesity in PKU has recently gained interest, although fat mass correlates better with cardiometabolic risk than body mass index. In this systematic review, the objective was to assess whether adult patients with PKU have higher fat mass than healthy controls. Studies of adult PKU patients undergoing dietary treatment in a metabolic clinic reporting fat mass were included. The PubMed and EMBASE databases were searched. Relevance of articles, data collection, and risk of bias were evaluated by two independent reviewers. Ten articles were evaluated, six with a control group, including 310 subjects with PKU, 62 with mild hyperphenylalaninemia, and 157 controls. One study reported a significant and four a tendency towards an increased fat mass in all patients or only females with PKU. Limitations included not having a healthy control group, not reporting sex-specific results and using different techniques to assess fat mass. Evaluation of fat mass should be included in the morphofunctional assessment of cardiometabolic risk in adult patients with PKU."

    "abstract": "Newborn bloodspot screening (NBS) began in the early 1960s based on the work of Dr. Robert \"Bob\" Guthrie in Buffalo, NY, USA. His development of a screening test for phenylketonuria on blood absorbed onto a special filter paper and transported to a remote testing laboratory began it all. Expansion of NBS to large numbers of asymptomatic congenital conditions flourishes in many settings while it has not yet been realized in others. The need for NBS as an efficient and effective public health prevention strategy that contributes to lowered morbidity and mortality wherever it is sustained is well known in the medical field but not necessarily by political policy makers. Acknowledging the value of national NBS reports published in 2007, the authors collaborated to create a worldwide NBS update in 2015. In a continuing attempt to review the progress of NBS globally, and to move towards a more harmonized and equitable screening system, we have updated our 2015 report with information available at the beginning of 2024. Reports on sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean, missing in 2015, have been included. Tables popular in the previous report have been updated with an eye towards harmonized comparisons. To emphasize areas needing attention globally, we have used regional tables containing similar listings of conditions screened, numbers of screening laboratories, and time at which specimen collection is recommended. Discussions are limited to bloodspot screening."

We synthesized several new gold clusters (AA-Au NCs) stabilized by various aromatic amino acids - 3,4-dihydroxy-L-phenylalanine (DOPA), L-tryptophan (Trp), L-tyrosine (Tyr) and L-phenylalanine (Phe), emitting in the violet-green spectral range. Their luminescence appeared to be sensitive to the presence of pterin, leucopterin, folic acid and guanine depending on the stabilizing matrix. Thus, a facile and cost-effective approach for the detection of pteridines is proposed. AA-Au NC-based sensors work according to \"turn-off\" and \"turn-on\" mechanisms. The possible physical origins of their luminescence quenching and enhancement are discussed."

    "abstract": "Continued dietary treatment since early diagnosis through newborn screening programs usually prevents brain-related complications in phenylketonuria (PKU). However, subtle neurocognitive and brain alterations may be observed in some adult patients despite early treatment. Nevertheless, neuropsychological and neuroimaging studies in the field remain scarce. This work aimed to determine possible neuropsychological and structural brain alterations in treated adult patients with PKU. Thirty-five patients with PKU and 22 healthy controls (HC) underwent neuropsychological assessment and T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging on a 3 T scanner. FreeSurfer (v.7.1) was used to obtain volumetric measures and SPSS (v27.0.1.0) was used to analyze sociodemographic, neuropsychological, volumetric, and clinical data (p < 0.05). Adult patients with PKU showed significantly lower performance than HC in Full Scale IQ (t = 2.67; p = .010) from the WAIS-IV. The PKU group also showed significantly lower volumes than HC in the pallidum (U = 224.000; p = .008), hippocampus (U = 243.000; p = .020), amygdala (U = 200.000; p = .002), and brainstem (t = 3.17; p = .006) as well as in total cerebral white matter volume (U = 175.000; p = .001). Blood phenylalanine (Phe) levels in PKU patients were negatively correlated with the pallidum (r = -0.417; p = .013) and brainstem (r = -0.455, p = .006) volumes. Adult patients with early-treated PKU showed significantly lower global intelligence than HC. Moreover, these patients showed reduced global white matter volume as well as reductions in the volume of several subcortical grey matter structures, which might be related to the existence of underlying neurodevelopmental alterations. Higher blood Phe levels were also negatively correlated with pallidum and brainstem, suggesting a higher vulnerability of these structures to Phe toxicity."

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a genetic disorder caused by variations in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene. Among the 3369 reported PAH variants, 33.7% are missense alterations. Unfortunately, 30% of these missense variants are classified as variants of unknown significance (VUS), posing challenges for genetic risk assessment. In our study, we focused on analyzing 836 missense PAH variants following the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics/Association for Molecular Pathology (ACMG/AMP) guidelines specified by ClinGen PAH Variant Curation Expert Panel (VCEP) criteria. We utilized and compared variant annotator tools like Franklin and Varsome, conducted 3D structural analysis of PAH, and examined active and regulatory site hotspots. In addition, we assessed potential splicing effect of apparent missense variants. By evaluating phenotype data from 22962 PKU patients, our aim was to reassess the pathogenicity of missense variants. Our comprehensive approach successfully reclassified 309 VUSs out of 836 missense variants as likely pathogenic or pathogenic (37%), upgraded 370 likely pathogenic variants to pathogenic, and reclassified one previously considered likely benign variant as likely pathogenic. Phenotypic information was available for 636 missense variants, with 441 undergoing 3D structural analysis and active site hotspot identification for 180 variants. After our analysis, only 6% of missense variants were classified as VUSs, and three of them (c.23A>C/p.Asn8Thr, c.59_60delinsCC/p.Gln20Pro, and c.278A >T/p.Asn93Ile) may be influenced by abnormal splicing. Moreover, a pathogenic variant (c.168G>T/p.Glu56Asp) was identified to have a risk exceeding 98% for modifications of the consensus splice site, with high scores indicating a donor loss of 0.94. The integration of ACMG/AMP guidelines with in silico structural analysis and phenotypic data significantly reduced the number of missense VUSs, providing a strong basis for genetic counseling and emphasizing the importance of metabolic phenotype information in variant curation. This study also sheds light on the current landscape of PAH variants."

Between January 2020 and June 2020, 156 patients with PKU and their parents who arrived for regular examinations were included. Parents were asked to complete the parenting stress index, Zarit Burden Scale, and the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), and children over the age of 11 were asked to fill the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and the SDQ. We found a significant negative correlation between the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale and age at diagnosis (r = -0.27, P = .035), mother's age (r = -0.33, P = .009), and father's age (r = -0.38, P = .004). There was a significant positive correlation between the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and patient's age (r = 0.36, P = .006), mother's age (r = 0.29, P = .031) and father's age (r = 0.38, P = .024). In the child form of the SDQ, emotional problems were significantly positively correlated with serum phenylalanine (Phe) levels at diagnosis (r = 0.35, P = .036), total points were significantly positively correlated with serum Phe levels at clinical examination (r = -0.34, P = .004), and social problems were significantly negatively correlated with the father's age (r = -0.34, P = .047). We found a significant positive correlation between the Zarit Burden Scale and number of siblings (r = 0.195, P = .023). In the parent form of the SDQ, emotional problems were significantly positively correlated with patient age (r = 0.217, P = .032), peer problems were significantly positively correlated with age at diagnosis (r = 0.211, P = .037), behavioral problems (r = 0.203, P = .045), and attention deficit and hyperactivity (r = 0.203, P = .045) were significantly positively correlated with serum Phe levels at diagnosis. Phenylketonuria is difficult to cope with both for the patients and their parents because of diet obligation, high expenditures for the formulas required for the diet, requirement of regular clinical examinations, and possible development of mental disability and psychiatric disorders. Patients and their families should be psychologically evaluated and support should be provided if needed."

Overall metabolic shifts in pregnancy go from anabolism to catabolism driven by endocrinologic changes, along with changes in rates of gluconeogenesis, glucose consumption, amino acid transport, protein consumption, and lipid breakdown, result in a complicated metabolic picture. Additionally, maternal inborn errors of metabolism can affect a fetus, as in phenylketonuria, and fetal inborn errors of metabolism can affect the mother, as in certain fatty acid oxidation disorders. Data on these conditions is often very limited. A summary of the current literature, risks associated with pregnancy in inborn errors of metabolism, and suggestions for management of these conditions will be presented."

The study aims to identify what individual, interpersonal, and environmental factors serve as facilitators and inhibitors, and how PKU intrudes on different realms of health. Attendees of Emory's Metabolic Camp and female users of Medical Nutrition Therapy for Prevention (MNT4P) were recruited. Participants were administered the Illness Intrusiveness Ratings Scale (IIRS) survey and qualitatively interviewed. The IIRS survey was analyzed using descriptive statistics and the interviews were coded and assessed using inductive and deductive analysis. In total, 25 participants were included in analysis (adults, <i>n</i> = 20; adolescents, <i>n</i> = 5). In the IIRS survey, diet had the highest average impact score of 5.74 (SD = 2.05) and religious expression had the lowest average impact score of 1.74 (SD = 1.65). The most salient themes that arose from the qualitative interviews were related to concerns of pregnancy (<i>n</i> = 25), interactions with health care providers relative to PKU care (<i>n</i> = 23) and independent of PKU care (<i>n</i> = 21), social support (n = 21) and isolation (<i>n</i> = 12), financial issues (<i>n</i> = 22), and illness intrusiveness on general health management (n = 22). Adolescent and adult female participants with PKU identified significant concerns in individual, interpersonal, and environmental factors affecting the management of their health. Additionally, the illness intrusiveness of PKU impacted their physical, mental, and gynecological health. Future research should further assess the unique challenges faced by females with PKU and potential interventions to better address these barriers."

    "title": "Pterin Profiling in Serum, Dried Blood Spot, and Urine Samples Using LC-MS/MS in Patients with Inherited Hyperphenylalaninemia.",
    "abstract": "Hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA) is defined as blood phenylalanine (Phe) levels exceeding the normal values (>120 μmol/L or >2 mg/dL) and is caused by a deficiency in the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH). The widespread screening of Phe levels in newborn screening programs has led to a very high number of patients with HPA. The samples were collected at various ages, not at the point of diagnosis. Nine pterin derivatives, including isoxanthopterin, sepiapterin, xanthopterin, primapterin, biopterin, neopterin, 7,8-dihydrobiopterin, 7,8-dihydroneopterin, and tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), were analyzed in different HPA classes in serum, dried blood spots (DBS), and urine samples. A total of 18 patients, including six classical phenylketonuria (PKU), eight BH4-responsive PKU, and four mild HPA patients, were included in the study. Among the nine pterin derivatives measured, a significant increase was observed in the levels of isoxanthopterin, biopterin, and 7,8-dihydrobiopterin in serum, dried blood spots (DBS), and urine samples of patients with HPA compared to the control group. However, elevations in isoxanthopterin, biopterin, and 7,8-dihydrobiopterin were observed in all HPA groups, although the extent of elevation varied among the different disease groups. There were also significant differences between HPA subgroups among these high values. In this study, it might be suggested that pterin profiling shows promising potential for its effective utilization in the differential diagnosis of HPA. Pterin profiling demonstrated its efficacy in accurately categorizing patients into distinct subtypes. This approach offers several notable advantages, including the ability to simultaneously screen multiple HPA subtypes through a single test, establish disease decision limits for pterins, shorten the time required for HPA differential diagnosis, reduce the risk of misdiagnosis, and increase overall diagnostic accuracy. This study is the most comprehensive study examining the association between HPA pterin in the literature. In our study, samples obtained from BH4-responsive PKU patients were on treatment. This may have affected the results. Preliminary findings on pterin profiles may need to be replicated in a prospective cohort of samples collected at the time of diagnosis to confirm the results."

    "abstract": "Recent changes in China's social medical insurance reimbursement policy have impacted the financial burden of patients with phenylketonuria (PKU) for special foods. However, whether this policy change is associated with their blood phenylalanine (PHE) concentration is unclear. To investigate the association between the reimbursement policy and blood PHE concentration in patients with PKU. This cohort study measured the blood PHE concentrations of 167 patients with PKU across 4 newborn screening centers in China from January 2018 to December 2021. The reimbursement policy for special foods for patients with PKU at 2 centers was canceled in 2019 and restored from 2020 onwards. In contrast, the other 2 centers consistently implemented the policy. Data were analyzed from September 10 to December 6, 2023. The implementation and cancelation of the reimbursement policy for special foods of patients with PKU. The blood PHE concentration was regularly measured from 2018 to 2021. A 1-sided Z test was used to compare the mean of the blood PHE concentration between different years. Among 167 patients with PKU (mean [SD] age, 84.4 [48.3] months; 87 males [52.1%]), a total of 4285 measurements of their blood PHE concentration were collected from 2018 to 2021. For patients at the center that canceled the reimbursement policy in 2019, the mean (SD) of the blood PHE concentrations in 2019 was 5.95 (5.73) mg/dL, significantly higher than 4.84 (4.11) mg/dL in 2018 (P < .001), 5.06 (5.21) mg/dL in 2020 (P = .006), and 4.77 (4.04) mg/dL in 2021 (P < .001). Similarly, for patients at the other center that canceled the policy in 2019, the mean (SD) of the blood PHE concentrations in 2019 was 5.95 (3.43) mg/dL, significantly higher than 5.34 (3.45) mg/dL in 2018 (P = .03), 5.13 (3.15) mg/dL in 2020 (P = .003), and 5.39 (3.46) mg/dL in 2021 (P = .03). On the contrary, no significant difference was observed between any of the years for patients at the 2 centers that consistently implemented the policy. In this cohort study of patients with PKU from multiple centers, the implementation of the reimbursement policy for special foods was associated with controlling the blood PHE concentration. Special foods expenditure for patients with PKU should be included in the scope of long-term social medical insurance reimbursement."

    "abstract": "To explore the characteristics of phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene variants and prenatal diagnosis for 43 Chinese pedigrees affected with Phenylketonuria (PKU). Forty three PKU pedigrees diagnosed at the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University between 2019 and 2021 were selected as the study subjects. Variants of the PAH gene of the probands were screened by high-throughput sequencing, and candidate variants were verified by Sanger sequencing. Negative cases were further analyzed by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) to detect large fragment deletions and duplications of the PAH gene. For 43 women undergoing subsequent pregnancy, Sanger sequencing, MLPA, combined with short tandem repeats (STR) sequence-based linkage analysis, were carried out for prenatal diagnosis. Among the 86 alleles carried by the 43 probands, 78 nucleotide variants (90.70%) and 3 large deletions (3.49%) were found based on high-throughput sequencing and MLPA. The 81 mutant alleles had included 21 missense variants, 5 splice site variants, 4 nonsense variants, 2 microdeletions, 1 insertional variant and 2 large fragment deletions. Relatively common variants have included p.Arg243Gln (23.26%), p.Arg111Ter (8.14%), EX6-96A>G (6.98%), p.Val399Val (5.81%) and p.Arg413Pro (4.65%). Most of the variants were located in exons 7, 11, 3, 6 and 12. For the 43 families undergoing prenatal diagnosis, 9 fetuses (20.45%) were diagnosed with PKU, 20 (45.45%) were heterozygous carriers, and 15 (34.09%) did not carry the same pathogenic allele as the proband. All neonates were followed up till 6 months old, and the accuracy of prenatal diagnosis was 100%. The combination of high-throughput sequencing, Sanger sequencing, MLPA and linkage analysis can increase the diagnostic rate of PKU and attain accurate prenatal diagnosis."

    "title": "Current Advances and Material Innovations in the Search for Novel Treatments of Phenylketonuria.",
    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a genetically inherited disease caused by a mutation of the gene encoding phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) and is the most common inborn error of amino acid metabolism. A deficiency of PAH leads to increased blood and brain levels of phenylalanine (Phe), which may cause permanent neurocognitive symptoms and developmental delays if untreated. Current management strategies for PKU consist of early detection through neonatal screening and implementation of a restrictive diet with minimal amounts of natural protein in combination with Phe-free supplements and low-protein foods to meet nutritional requirements. For milder forms of PKU, oral treatment with synthetic sapropterin (BH4), the cofactor of PAH, may improve metabolic control of Phe and allow for more natural protein to be included in the patient's diet. For more severe forms, daily injections of pegvaliase, a PEGylated variant of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), may allow for normalization of blood Phe levels. However, the latter treatment has considerable drawbacks, notably a strong immunogenicity of the exogenous enzyme and the attached polymeric chains. Research for novel therapies of PKU makes use of innovative materials for drug delivery and state-of-the-art protein engineering techniques to develop treatments which are safer, more effective, and potentially permanent."

Regular outpatient follow-up care and measurement of the phenylalanine levels in the blood are required. We aimed to analyze the economic burden of phenylketonuria on families and the state. The patients with phenylketonuria were divided into three groups according to their treatment: a low-phenylalanine diet group (<i>n</i> = 50), a tetrahydrobiopterin group (<i>n</i> = 44), and a group taking tetrahydrobiopterin together with the diet (<i>n</i> = 25). A comparative cost analysis was carried out. The annual economic burden to the state was calculated to average EUR 18,801 ± 15,345 and was lowest in the diet group, then in the tetrahydrobiopterin group, and highest in the tetrahydrobiopterin + diet group (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Out-of-pocket costs amounted to EUR 1531 ± 1173 per year, and indirect losses averaged EUR 2125 ± 1930 per year for all families. The economic loss was significantly lower in the families taking tetrahydrobiopterin than in the other groups (<i>p</i> = 0.001). The combined use of medical nutrition and BH4 treatments has been shown to increase the economic burden on the state. Reimbursing low-protein products and increasing the number of patients eligible for financial allowances may reduce the economic burden on families."

    "abstract": "The published data on the vitamin status of patients with phenylketonuria (PKU) is contradictory; therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the vitamin status of PKU patients. A comprehensive search of multiple databases (PubMed, Web of Sciences, Cochrane, and Scopus) was finished in March 2024. The included studies compared vitamin levels between individuals diagnosed with early-treated PKU and healthy controls while excluding pregnant and lactating women, untreated PKU or hyperphenylalaninemia cases, control groups receiving vitamin supplementation, PKU patients receiving tetrahydrobiopterin or pegvaliase, and conference abstracts. The risk of bias in the included studies was assessed by the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. The effect sizes were expressed as standardised mean differences. The calculation of effect sizes with 95% CI using fixed-effects models and random-effects models was performed. A <i>p</i>-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The study protocol was registered in the PROSPERO database (CRD42024519589). Out of the initially identified 11,086 articles, 24 met the criteria. The total number of participants comprised 770 individuals with PKU and 2387 healthy controls. The meta-analyses of cross-sectional and case-control studies were conducted for vitamin B12, D, A, E, B6 and folate levels. PKU patients demonstrated significantly higher folate levels (random-effects model, SMD: 1.378, 95% CI: 0.436, 2.320, <i>p</i> = 0.004) and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D concentrations (random-effects model, SMD: 2.059, 95% CI: 0.250, 3.868, <i>p</i> = 0.026) compared to the controls. There were no significant differences in vitamin A, E, B6, B12 or 25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels. The main limitations of the evidence include a limited number of studies and their heterogeneity and variability in patients' compliance. Our findings suggest that individuals with PKU under nutritional guidance can achieve a vitamin status comparable to that of healthy subjects. Our study provides valuable insights into the nutritional status of PKU patients, but further research is required to confirm these findings and explore additional factors influencing vitamin status in PKU."

This study was conducted during 2021-2023. Blood collection dates, results, and probable parameters causing delays in the screening program were recorded. This study included 118 infants. Admission time to the polyclinic was (mean ± SD) 25.2 ± 12.6 days (min-max: 3.4-78.9 days). Admission time was significantly high for refugees, those whose parents were consanguineous, and those who had more heel-prick blood samples taken (<i>p</i> < 0.001, <i>p</i> = 0.005, and <i>p</i> < 0.001, respectively). The first heel-prick blood phenylalanine (phe) level was significantly negatively correlated with the admission time (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Patients' admission time whose first blood phe level < 240 μmol/L was statistically significantly higher than in those with ≥240 μmol/L (<i>p</i> < 0.001). We determined that there were delays in PKU screening from birth to admission to the polyclinic. Being a refugee, the presence of consanguineous marriages, the increase in the number of heel-prick tests, and blood phe levels at a range of 120-240 μmol/L were the factors that played a role in this delay. Taking steps to reduce the impact of these parameters can prevent delays in newborn PKU screening and increase the success of the screening program."

    "abstract": "Glycomacropeptide (GMP) is a bioactive peptide derived from whey protein, consisting of 64 amino acids. It is a phenylalanine-free peptide, making it a beneficial dietary option for individuals dealing with phenylketonuria (PKU). PKU is an inherited metabolic disorder characterized by high levels of phenylalanine in the bloodstream, resulting from a deficiency of phenylalanine dehydrogenase in affected individuals. Consequently, patients with PKU require lifelong adherence to a low-phenylalanine diet, wherein a significant portion of their protein intake is typically sourced from a phenylalanine-free amino acid formula. GMP has several nutritional values, numerous bioactivity properties, and therapeutic effects in various inflammatory disorders. Despite all these features, the purification of GMP is an imperative requirement; however, there are no unique methods for achieving this goal. Traditionally, several methods have been used for GMP purification, such as thermal or acid treatment, alcoholic precipitation, ultrafiltration (UF), gel filtration, and membrane separation techniques. However, these methods have poor specificity, and the presence of large amounts of impurities can interfere with the analysis of GMP. More efficient and highly specific GMP purification methods need to be developed. In this review, we have highlighted and summarized the current research progress on the major biological features and purification methodologies associated with GMP, as well as providing an extensive overview of the recent developments in using charged UF membranes for GMP purification and the influential factors."

We retrospectively analyzed longitudinal data collected from 1993 to 2019 of patients diagnosed with classic PKU that were followed at our center during adolescence (14-18 y) and at least once in adulthood (>18 y). Patients who interrupted their contact with our center after the 18th birthday for at least 2 years were classified as LTFU. We performed a multivariate regression analysis to investigate following potential risk factors for becoming LTFU in adult life: sex, dietary compliance during adolescence assessed through the mean of the annual medians of phenylalanine plasma values, average number of contacts with the center during adolescence and age at first visit after the 18th birthday. 93 patients (52 males, 41 females) were included in the study. 58% became LTFU during adulthood.

This programme currently screens for 26 IEMs in dried blood and urine samples collected 24-72 h after birth. In its 22-year history, this programme has analysed samples from 440,723 neonates and identified 326 cases of IEM with a prevalence of 1:1351. The most prevalent IEMs were hyperphenylalaninaemia (n = 118), followed by medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MCADD, n = 26), galactosaemia (n = 20), and cystinurias (n = 43). Sixty-one false positives and 18 conditions related to maternal pathologies were detected. Urine samples have been identified as a useful secondary sample to reduce the rate of false positives and identify new defects. There were 5 false negatives. The overall positive value was 84.23%.

Phenylketonuria (PKU) patients, who follow a lifelong low-protein diet, exhibit higher prevalence of oral diseases such as periodontitis, offering a suitable model to explore the interplay between diet, oral microbiota and oral health. We conducted 16S rDNA sequencing on saliva and subgingival plaque from 109 PKU patients (ages 6-68 years) and 114 age-matched controls and correlated oral microbial composition and dental health. PKU patients exhibited worse dental health, reduced oral microbial diversity and a difference in the abundance of specific taxa, especially Actinobacteriota species, compared to controls. PKU patients with poor periodontal health exhibited higher alpha diversity than the orally healthy ones, marked by high abundance of the genus Tannerella. Notably, the observed taxonomic differences in PKU patients with normal indices of decayed/missing/filled teeth, plaque control record, gingival bleeding index and periodontal screening and recording index generally differed from microbial signatures of periodontitis. PKU patients' reduced microbial diversity may be due to their diet's metabolic challenges disrupting microbial and immune balance, thus increasing oral inflammation. Higher alpha diversity in PKU patients with oral inflammation is likely related to expanded microbial niches."

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder resulting from deficient phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) enzyme activity, leading to impaired phenylalanine (Phe) metabolism. This condition can lead to intellectual disability, epilepsy, and behavioural issues. Treatment typically involves strict dietary restrictions on natural protein intake, supplemented with chemically manufactured protein substitutes containing amino acids other than Phe. Various approaches, including casein glycomacropeptide (GMP), tetrahydrobiopterin (BH<sub>4</sub>), phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) therapy, large neutral amino acid (LNAA) supplementation, enzyme therapy, gene therapy, and medical therapies, aim to prevent Phe transport in the brain to potentially treat PKU. Although newborn screening programs and early dietary interventions have enhanced outcomes of the potential treatment strategies, limitations still persist in this direction. These involve potent accuracy concerns in diagnosis due to the existence of antibiotics in blood of PKU patients, affecting growth of the bacteria in the bacterial inhibition assay. Monitoring involves complex methods for instance, mass spectrometry and high-pressure liquid chromatography, which involve shortcomings such as lengthy protocols and the need for specialized equipment. To address these limitations, adaptable testing formats like bio/nano sensors are emerging with their cost-effectiveness, biodegradability, and rapid, accurate, and sensitive detection capabilities, offering promising alternatives for PKU diagnosis. This review provides insights into current treatment and diagnostic approaches, emphasizing on the potential applications of the diverse sensors intended for PKU diagnosis."

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria is a rare metabolic disease resulting from a deficiency of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. Recent cross-sectional evidence suggests that early-treated adults with phenylketonuria exhibit alterations in cortical grey matter compared to healthy peers. However, the effects of high phenylalanine exposure on brain structure in adulthood need to be further elucidated. In this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial, we investigated the impact of a 4-week high phenylalanine exposure on the brain structure and its relationship to cognitive performance and metabolic parameters in early-treated adults with phenylketonuria. Twenty-eight adult patients with early-treated classical phenylketonuria (19-48 years) underwent magnetic resonance imaging before and after the 4-week phenylalanine and placebo interventions (four time points). Structural T1-weighted images were preprocessed and evaluated using Direct Cortical Thickness Estimation using Deep Learning-based Anatomy Segmentation and Cortex Parcellation (DL+DiReCT), a deep-learning-based tool for brain morphometric analysis. Cortical thickness, white matter volume and ventricular volume were compared between the phenylalanine and placebo periods. Brain phenylalanine levels were measured using 1H spectroscopy. Blood levels of phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan were assessed at each of the four time points, along with performance in executive functions and attention. Blood phenylalanine levels were significantly higher after the phenylalanine period (1441 µmol/l) than after the placebo period (873 µmol/l, P < 0.001). Morphometric analyses revealed a statistically significant decrease in cortical thickness in 17 of 60 brain regions after the phenylalanine period compared to placebo. The largest decreases were observed in the right pars orbitalis (point estimate = -0.095 mm, P < 0.001) and the left lingual gyrus (point estimate = -0.070 mm, P < 0.001). Bilateral white matter and ventricular volumes were significantly increased after the phenylalanine period. However, the structural alterations in the phenylalanine-placebo group returned to baseline measures following the washout and placebo period. Additionally, elevated blood and brain phenylalanine levels were related to increased bilateral white matter volume (rs = 0.43 to 0.51, P ≤ 0.036) and decreased cortical thickness [rs = -0.62 to -0.39, not surviving false discovery rate (FDR) correction] after the phenylalanine and placebo periods. Moreover, decreased cortical thickness was correlated with worse cognitive performance after both periods (rs = -0.54 to -0.40, not surviving FDR correction). These findings provide evidence that a 4-week high phenylalanine exposure in adults with phenylketonuria results in transient reductions of the cortical grey matter and increases in white matter volume. Further research is needed to determine the potential long-term impact of high phenylalanine levels on brain structure and function in adults with phenylketonuria."

Lastly, in a humanized <i>PAH</i> P281L mouse model, we showed that when formulated in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) with adenine base editor mRNA, selected hybrid gRNAs revert the PKU phenotype, substantially enhance on-target editing, and reduce bystander editing <i>in vivo</i>. These studies highlight the utility of hybrid gRNAs to improve the safety and efficacy of base-editing therapies."

    "title": "Comprehensive analyses of phenylalanine hydroxylase variants and phenotypic characteristics of patients in the eastern region of Türkiye.",
    "abstract": "Phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) is predominantly a hepatic enzyme that catalyzes phenylalanine (Phe) into tyrosine, which is the rate-limiting step in Phe catabolism. Biallelic variants in the <i>PAH</i> gene cause PAH enzyme deficiency. Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an autosomal recessive disorder that causes neurologic, behavioral, and dermatological findings. PKU could be divided clinically into three types based on the blood Phe levels: classic phenylketonuria (cPKU), mild-moderate phenylketonuria (mPKU), and mild hyperphenylalaninemia (MHP). This study aimed to determine the phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of Turkish PKU patients in the eastern region of Türkiye. Demographic characteristics, serum Phe levels, treatments, and <i>PAH</i> variants of 163 patients with PKU and hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA) were retrospectively evaluated. Blood Phe levels of the patients were analyzed with the high-performance liquid chromatography method. For <i>PAH</i> gene analysis, next-generation sequencing was performed. Of the 163 patients included in the study, 38 (23.3 %) had cPKU, 16 (9.8 %) had mPKU, and 109 (66.9 %) had MHP. Homozygous variants in the <i>PAH</i> gene were detected in 66 (40.5 %) of the patients, while compound heterozygous variants were detected in 97 (59.5 %) patients. Two novel and 35 recurrent variants in the <i>PAH</i> gene were detected. Of the two novel variants, one was missense (p.Phe351Leu) and the other was frameshift (p.Met276Cysfs*65). The most frequently detected variants were p.Thr380Met (18 %), p.Arg261Gln (16.8 %), and p.Ala300Ser (12.8 %). All patients with the homozygous c.1066-11G>A variant exhibited cPKU phenotype. The c.898G>T (p.Ala300Ser), c.1139C>T (p.Thr380Met), and c.1208C>T (p.Ala403Val) variants were statistically related to mild phenotype. On the other hand, c.592_613del (p.Tyr198Serfs*136), c.1028A>G (p.Tyr343Cys), and c.782G>A (p.Arg261Gln) variants were more frequently detected in the cPKU group. Our study, conducted with patients from the eastern region of Türkiye, demonstrates the genetic heterogeneity in the Turkish population. Simultaneously, our research contributes to genotype-phenotype correlation and expands the genotypic spectrum by identifying novel variants."

    "abstract": "Rare diseases, defined by their low prevalence, present significant challenges, including delayed detection, expensive treatments, and limited research. This study delves into the genetic basis of two noteworthy rare diseases in Saudi Arabia: Phenylketonuria (PKU) and Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA). PKU, resulting from mutations in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene, exhibits geographical variability and impacts intellectual abilities. SMA, characterized by motor neuron loss, is linked to mutations in the survival of motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene. Recognizing the importance of unveiling signature genomics in rare diseases, we conducted a quantitative study on PAH and SMN1 proteins of multiple organisms by employing various quantitative techniques to assess genetic variations. The derived signature-genomics contributes to a deeper understanding of these critical genes, paving the way for enhanced diagnostics for disorders associated with PAH and SMN1."

    "title": "Pegvaliase for the treatment of phenylketonuria: Final results of a long-term phase 3 clinical trial program.",
    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a genetic disorder caused by deficiency of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH), which results in phenylalanine (Phe) accumulation in the blood and brain, and requires lifelong treatment to keep blood Phe in a safe range. Pegvaliase is an enzyme-substitution therapy approved for individuals with PKU and uncontrolled blood Phe concentrations (>600 μmol/L) despite prior management. Aggregated results from the PRISM clinical trials demonstrated substantial and sustained reductions in blood Phe with a manageable safety profile, but also noted individual variation in time to and dose needed for a first response. This analysis reports longer-term aggregate findings and characterizes individual participant responses to pegvaliase using final data from the randomized trials PRISM-1 (NCT01819727) and PRISM-2 (NCT01889862), and the open-label extension study 165-304 (NCT03694353). In 261 adult participants with a mean of 36.6 months of pegvaliase treatment, 71.3%, 65.1%, and 59.4% achieved clinically significant blood Phe levels of ≤600, ≤360, and ≤ 120 μmol/L, respectively. Some participants achieved blood Phe reductions with <20 mg/day pegvaliase, although most required higher doses. Based on Kaplan-Meier analysis, median (minimum, maximum) time to first achievement of a blood Phe threshold of ≤600, ≤360, or ≤ 120 μmol/L was 4.4 (0.0, 54.0), 8.0 (0.0, 57.0), and 11.6 (0.0, 66.0) months, respectively. Once achieved, blood Phe levels remained below clinical threshold in most participants. Sustained Phe response (SPR), a new method described within for measuring durability of blood Phe response, was achieved by 85.5%, 84.7%, and 78.1% of blood Phe responders at blood Phe thresholds of ≤600, ≤360, or ≤ 120 μmol/L, respectively. Longer-term safety data were consistent with previous reports, with the most common adverse events (AEs) being arthralgia, injection site reactions, headache, and injection site erythema. The incidence of most AEs, including hypersensitivity AEs, was higher during the early treatment phase (≤6 months) than later during treatment. In conclusion, using data from three key pegvaliase clinical trials, participants treated with pegvaliase were able to reach clinically significant blood Phe reductions to clinical thresholds of ≤600, ≤360, or ≤ 120 μmol/L during early treatment, with safety profiles improving from early to sustained treatment. This study also supports the use of participant-level data and new ways of looking at durable blood Phe responses to better characterize patients' individual PKU treatment journeys."

    "abstract": "We assessed the relationship between the cognitive development of children and adolescents with phenylketonuria (PKU) and fluctuations in peripheral phenylalanine (Phe) levels. We examined the neurocognitive performance of 33 children and adolescents with early treated PKU, of whom 18 were treated with sapropterin dihydrochloride, and 15 were on a classic diet. For 26 weeks, patients were assessed weekly for their blood phenylalanine (Phe) levels. Phe levels were analyzed for fluctuations indicated by the individual standard deviation. Fluctuations were compared to the standard deviation of 26 Phe level measurements before the study interval. We also assessed the concurrent IQ of the patients. This was repeated at one-, two-, and seven-year intervals. Full-scale IQ in patients treated with a classic diet did not change within the follow-up. In patients treated with Sapropterin dihydrochloride, however, there was a considerable gain in full-scale IQ. This was particularly true if blood Phe fluctuations increased in patients of this treatment group. Sapropterin dihydrochloride enhances Phe tolerance in patients with PKU. Increasing blood Phe fluctuations following enhanced Phe tolerance may indicate that the treatment not only allows patients to relax their Phe-restricted diet but also may support cognitive development in patients."

    "abstract": "Inborn errors of metabolism (IEMs) are a group of genetic diseases that occur due to the either deficiency of an enzyme involved in a metabolic/biochemical pathway or other disturbances in the metabolic pathway including transport protein or activator protein deficiencies, cofactor deficiencies, organelle biogenesis, maturation or trafficking problems. These disorders are collectively significant due to their substantial impact on both the well-being and survival of affected individuals. In the quest for effective treatments, enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) has emerged as a viable strategy for patients with many of the lysosomal storage disorders (LSD) and enzyme substitution therapy in the rare form of the other inborn errors of metabolism including phenylketonuria and hypophosphatasia. However, a major challenge associated with enzyme infusion in patients with these disorders, mainly LSD, is the development of high antibody titres. Strategies focusing on immunomodulation have shown promise in inducing immune tolerance to ERT, leading to improved overall survival rates. The implementation of immunomodulation concurrent with ERT administration has also resulted in a decreased occurrence of IgG antibody development compared with cases treated solely with ERT. By incorporating the knowledge gained from current approaches and analysing the outcomes of immune tolerance induction (ITI) modalities from clinical and preclinical trials have demonstrated significant improvement in the efficacy of ERT. In this comprehensive review, the progress in ITI modalities is assessed, drawing insights from both clinical and preclinical trials. The focus is on evaluating the advancements in ITI within the context of IEM, specifically addressing LSDs managed through ERT."

Management of PKU during pregnancy can be challenging as protein substitutes may exacerbate nausea, vomiting, and gastrointestinal symptoms. <b>Aim:</b> To report the successful management of four PKU pregnant women. <b>Methods:</b> The patients were administered with prolonged-release amino acid supplementation and were recommended to follow a strict diet. Blood Phe concentration, adherence to diet, and occurrence of adverse events were monitored. <b>Results:</b> All patients achieved safe levels of blood Phe concentration (120-360 µmol/L) since preconception and during pregnancy (mean Phe concentration values of 143.34 ± 137.59, 226.48 ± 194.57, 186.68 ± 133.67, and 187.47 ± 42.59 µmol/L). During the first trimester of pregnancy, all patients manifested gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, gastrointestinal reflux, and abdominal bloating, which were managed by either changing protein substitute or extending the time window between different meals and amino acid mixtures administration. The four women continued their pregnancies without experiencing further complications and delivered neonates with normal growth parameters and no malformations. <b>Conclusion:</b> Findings of this case series suggest that the intake of a prolonged-release amino acid mixture in granules is well tolerated by pregnant PKU patients, eventually leading to good metabolic control and fetal growth within normal ranges."

We performed a multicenter study of 29,601 newborns from eight screening centers with NBS via NGS combined with MS/MS. A custom-designed panel targeting the coding region of the 142 genes of 128 inborn errors of metabolism (IEMs) was applied as a first-tier screening test, and expanded NBS using MS/MS was executed simultaneously. In total, 52 genes associated with the 38 IEMs screened by MS/MS were analyzed. The NBS performance of these two methods was analyzed and compared respectively. A total of 23 IEMs were diagnosed via NGS combined with MS/MS. The incidence of IEMs was approximately 1 in 1287. Within separate statistical analyses, the positive predictive value (PPV) for MS/MS was 5.29%, and the sensitivity was 91.3%. However, for genetic screening alone, the PPV for NGS was 70.83%, with 73.91% sensitivity. The three most common IEMs were methylmalonic academia (MMA), primary carnitine deficiency (PCD) and phenylketonuria (PKU). The five genes with the most common carrier frequencies were <i>PAH</i> (1:42), <i>PRODH</i> (1:51), <i>MMACHC</i> (1:52), <i>SLC25A13</i> (1:55) and <i>SLC22A5</i> (1:63).

    "abstract": "To establish a haplotype-based noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) workflow for single-gene recessive disorders that adapt to dizygotic (DZ) twin pregnancies. Twin pregnancies at risk of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Becker muscular dystrophy, hemophilia B, spinal muscular atrophy, phenylketonuria, and nonsyndromic hearing loss were recruited. For subsequent analysis, capture sequencing targeting highly heterozygotic single nucleotide polymorphism sites was conducted. Paternal-specific alleles were used to calculate the total and individual fetal fractions and determine zygosity. A two-step Bayes Factor model was applied to clarify the complex genomic landscape in the maternal plasma: the first step involved determining whether the twins inherited the same haplotype, and the second step involved estimating their individual genotypes. NIPT results were subsequently confirmed by invasive diagnosis. Nine twin pregnancies were recruited, including five DZ and four monozygotic (MZ) twins. The earliest gestational age was 8<sup>+0</sup> weeks, and the minimum fetal fraction was 4.6%. Three twin pregnancies were reported with one affected fetus, while the remaining six were reported without affected fetuses. Two dichorionic diamniotic twin pregnancies were confirmed to be MZ twins. The NIPT results were 100% consistent with those of invasive procedures or diagnostic genetic testing after birth. This study is the first to perform NIPT for single-gene disorders in twin pregnancies and preliminarily confirm its clinical feasibility. Acknowledging the twins' genotypes in the first trimester is valuable as it empowers obstetric care providers and parents to have adequate time for pregnancy management and decision-making."

However, the diet can be onerous, resulting in poor adherence. We carried out the first online national survey in Italy to better understand the perceptions, knowledge, and experiences of both patients with PKU and caregivers with the goal of improving patient outcomes. An online survey of 35 questions to patients and 36 questions to caregivers was distributed in September 2022 through physicians and relevant Italian associations. The information collected included knowledge and impact of PKU, unmet needs, knowledge of available drugs, and satisfaction with therapy. Overall, 241 questionnaires were completed by 85 patients and 156 caregivers (96.0% were parents). Knowledge of the pathogenic basis of PKU was generally high. The most common patient-reported symptoms were agitation/anxiety (48.8%), fatigue (41.1%), mood disorders (39.8%), and difficulty concentrating (33.4%). Different perspectives on adherence to a low-Phe diet were observed (22.9% of patients reported strict adherence vs. 47.0% of caregivers). Drugs that allow more freedom were needed by 49.4% of patients and 61.7% of caregivers, along with a wider range of choices of non-dietary treatments (48.2% and 60.0%, respectively). Unmet informational needs of patients included PKU and pregnancy, complications, travel, sports, and transition into adult care. Our data showed that patients with PKU and their caregivers reported difficulties in adherence to diet therapy and indicated interest in new therapeutic approaches. Apparent differences between patient and caregiver perspectives were identified. More informational resources on PKU are needed."

We recruited laboratories that participated in the EQA of quantitative analysis of urinary organic acids with GC-MS before joining the surveys. In each survey, a set of five real urine samples was distributed to each participant. The participants should analyze the sample by GC-MS and report the \"analytical result\", \"the most likely diagnosis\", and \"recommendation for further tests\" to the NCCL before the deadline. A total of 21 laboratories participated in the scheme. The pass rates were 94.4% in 2020 and 89.5% in 2021. For all eight IMDs tested, the analytical proficiency rates ranged from 84.7% - 100%, and the interpretational performance rate ranged from 88.2% - 97.0%. The performance on hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA), 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase deficiency (MCCD), and ethylmalonic encephalopathy (EE) samples were not satisfactory. In general, the participants of this pilot EQA scheme are equipped with the basic capability for qualitative organic acid analysis and interpretation of the results. Limited by the small size of laboratories and samples involved, this activity could not fully reflect the state of clinical practice of Chinese laboratories. NCCL will improve the EQA scheme and implement more EQA activities in the future."

Glycomacropeptide (GMP), a peptide derived from casein, is naturally low in phenylalanine (Phe) and, thus, adequate for protein substitutes (PSs) for the management of PKU in children. This review aims primarily to analyse the differences in the nutritional composition of GMP-based protein substitutes in different formulations (ready to drink, powdered, and bars), and secondarily to assess the quality of these products, comparing their nutritional composition with that of standard amino acid (L-AA) mixtures. Thirty-five GMP-based PSs produced by six different companies were included in this review: twenty-one powdered PSs, eight ready to drink, and six bars. The analysis revealed great heterogeneity not only among the different formulations (powdered, ready to drink, and bars) but also within the same group, in terms of energy content and nutritional composition. GMP-based PSs were shown to have higher contents of sugars and saturated fatty acids compared to L-AA PSs, especially in ready-to-drink formulations and bars. The latter also provided the highest amounts of energy among the GMP-based products. This finding may be related to a higher risk of developing overweight and obesity. The greater palatability of these GMP-based PSs, combined with improved nutritional quality, could not only improve adherence to diet therapy but also reduce the incidence of obesity-related comorbidities in PKU."

In this study, total homocysteine (tHcy) and methylmalonic acid (MMA) levels were analyzed in samples from 25 phenylketonuria (PKU) patients. Comparisons were made between pre- and post-treatment values (n= 3); on treatment values, between periods with high and normal/low phenylalanine (Phe) levels (n= 20); and in women before, during and after pregnancy (n= 3). THcy levels decreased after treating PKU with metabolic formula (p=0.014). Except for a pregnant woman before pregnancy, none of the patients had tHcy values above the normal range. In fact, tHcy was < 5 μmol/L in 34% of the samples. We observed a decrease in Phe, tHcy, and tyrosine levels during pregnancy. MMA levels did not differ significantly, with values remaining in the normal range. These data indicate that there was no B12 deficiency in patients who adhere to the diet. In conclusion, in PKU patients treated with metabolic formula, tHcy is frequently not elevated, remaining even in the lower normal range in some patients. Thus, clinical follow-up and adherence to dietary treatment are crucial to prevent B12 deficiency."

Recently, we identified a novel intron 11 splicing regulatory element where U1snRNP binds, participating in exon 11 definition. In this work, we describe the implementation of an antisense strategy targeting intron 11 sequences to correct the effect of <i>PAH</i> mis-splicing variants. We used an <i>in vitro</i> assay with minigenes and identified splice-switching antisense oligonucleotides (SSOs) that correct the exon skipping defect of <i>PAH</i> variants c.1199+17G>A, c.1199+20G>C, c.1144T>C, and c.1066-3C>T. To examine the functional rescue induced by the SSOs, we generated a hepatoma cell model with variant c.1199+17G>A using CRISPR/Cas9. The edited cell line reproduces the exon 11 skipping pattern observed from minigenes, leading to reduced PAH protein levels and activity. SSO transfection results in an increase in exon 11 inclusion and corrects PAH deficiency. Our results provide proof of concept of the potential therapeutic use of a single SSO for different exonic and intronic splicing variants causing <i>PAH</i> exon 11 skipping in PKU."

Moreover, these studies examined mice and/or rats (n=6), monkeys (n=1), and humans (n=2). Studies on EPs and hyperammonemia revealed that some wild strains such as <i>Lactobacillus plantarum</i> have an innate ammonia-hyper-consuming potential; thus, there was no need to manipulate them. However, manipulation is needed to obtain a phenylalanine-metabolizing strain. In conclusion, EPs can be used to manage or treat congenital metabolic diseases including PKU."

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder characterized by increased phenylalanine (Phe) concentrations in the blood and brain. Despite wide agreement on treatment during childhood, recommendations for adults are still controversial. To assess the impact of a 4-week increase in Phe intake (simulating normal dietary Phe consumption) on cognition, mood, and depression in early-treated adults with PKU in a double-blind, randomized controlled trial (RCT). In a single-site crossover trial, 30 adult patients with classical PKU diagnosed at birth were recruited. All patients underwent a 4-week period of oral Phe administration (1500-3000 mg Phe/d) and a 4-week placebo period in a randomly assigned order with age, sex, and place of usual medical care as stratification factors. Analyses were based on the intention-to-treat (ITT) and per protocol (PP) approach to claim noninferiority (noninferiority margin -4%), with working memory accuracy as the primary endpoint and additional cognitive domains, mood, and depression as secondary endpoints. For the primary endpoint, a 4-week increase of Phe intake was noninferior to placebo with respect to working memory accuracy in both the ITT [point estimate 0.49; lower limit 95% confidence interval (CI): -1.99] and the PP analysis (point estimate -1.22; lower limit 95% CI: -2.60). Secondary outcomes (working memory reaction time, manual dexterity, mood, and depression) did not significantly differ between the Phe and placebo period, except for sustained attention (point estimate 31.0; lower limit 95% CI: 9.0). Adverse events were more frequent during the Phe than during the placebo period (95% CI: 1.03, 2.28, P = 0.037). In early-treated adult patients with PKU, a 4-week high Phe intake was noninferior to continuing Phe restriction regarding working memory accuracy, and secondary outcomes did not differ except for sustained attention. Longer-term RCTs are required to determine whether low Phe levels need to be maintained throughout different periods of adulthood. This trial was registered at the clinicaltrials.gov as NCT03788343."

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria is a rare autosomal recessive metabolic disorder mainly due to a significant reduction in the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase, resulting in elevation of phenylalanine in the blood. Here, we have established two fibroblast-derived induced pluripotent stem cell lines using Sendai virus-based reprogramming. The established induced pluripotent stem cell lines exhibited a normal karyotype and expressed markers of pluripotency assessed through quantitative PCR, flow cytometry and immunocytochemistry. These cell lines also demonstrated the ability to differentiate into the three primary germ layers of the human body, including ectoderm, endoderm, and mesoderm."

    "abstract": "We employed a Sendai virus-based reprogramming method to transform human lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) derived from two individuals diagnosed with phenylketonuria (PKU) into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC). This reprogramming process involved the expression of the four Yamanaka factors: KLF4, OCT4, SOX2, and C-MYC. The resulting patient-specific iPSCs exhibited a normal karyotype and expressed endogenous pluripotent markers NANOG and OCT-4. Notably, these iPSCs demonstrated strong differentiation capabilities, giving rise to cell populations representing the ectoderm, endoderm, and mesoderm germ layers."

    "title": "Factors Impacting the Reduction in Neophobia Prevalence in Phenylketonuria Patients.",
    "abstract": "Food neophobia (FN), the fear of sampling new foods, can have a significant impact on children's eating habits. Children with phenylketonuria (PKU), a hereditary condition that inhibits the body's capacity to metabolize phenylalanine, should take this attitude with caution. Patients with PKU must follow a rigorous phenylalanine (Phe)-restricted diet to avoid brain malfunction that can include intellectual disability, seizures, and behavioral difficulties. The novelty of our work stems from the fact that we explored the origins of this incorrect intake pattern, which exacerbates PKU patients' already fragile health. We conducted a cross-sectional study on 34 previously diagnosed phenylketonuria patients and a control group ranging in age from 7 months to 40 years, with a sex ratio of M/F 2:1. The Food Neophobia Scale (FNS) was used to determine neophobia. We used JASP (version 0.18.1) statistical analysis to examine the relationship between neophobia and PKU condition, age and nutritional status at the time of study, diet compliance, parental educational level, period from birth to PKU diagnosis, and environmental (rural/urban) provenience of PKU patients. According to the data, 61.76% of patients with PKU were neophobic, as were 70.57% of the control group. Food neophobia was associated with PKU patients' present age, the period from birth to PKU diagnosis, and parental educational level."

    "abstract": "Despite numerous studies in human patients and animal models for phenylketonuria (PKU; OMIM#261600), the pathophysiology of PKU and the underlying causes of brain dysfunction and cognitive problems in PKU patients are not well understood. In this study, lumbar cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) was obtained immediately after blood sampling from early-treated adult PKU patients who had fasted overnight. Metabolite and amino acid concentrations in the CSF of PKU patients were compared with those of non-PKU controls. The CSF concentrations and CSF/plasma ratios for glucose and lactate were found to be below normal, similar to what has been reported for glucose transporter1 (GLUT1) deficiency patients who exhibit many of the same clinical symptoms as untreated PKU patients. CSF glucose and lactate levels were negatively correlated with CSF phenylalanine (Phe), while CSF glutamine and glutamate levels were positively correlated with CSF Phe levels. Plasma glucose levels were negatively correlated with plasma Phe concentrations in PKU subjects, which partly explains the reduced CSF glucose concentrations. Although brain glucose concentrations are unlikely to be low enough to impair brain glucose utilization, it is possible that the metabolism of Phe in the brain to produce phenyllactate, which can be transported across the blood-brain barrier to the blood, may consume glucose and/or lactate to generate the carbon backbone for glutamate. This glutamate is then converted to glutamine and carries the Phe-derived ammonia from the brain to the blood. While this mechanism remains to be tested, it may explain the correlations of CSF glutamine, glucose, and lactate concentrations with CSF Phe."

    "abstract": "The impact of phenylketonuria (PKU) on Quality of life (QoL) has been a topic of interest in recent research. This article reviews current researches on the impact of PKU on QoL. The review examines factors that may influence QoL, such as age, metabolic control, and treatment adherence. In this systematic review study, relevant articles were identified using a search strategy built with the keywords phenylketonuria, PKU, or hyperphenylalaninemia (or their synonyms) and QoL in Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed databases. After identifying the articles, duplicates, reviews, scientific abstracts, articles published in languages other than English, and non relevant studies were excluded. The search strategy identified 951 records from databases, and after excluding duplicates, irrelevant studies, and those published in non English languages, 26 records were left that contained data on 1816 patients with PKU/hyperphenylalaninemia. The studies included both children/adolescents and adults. Overall, the studies found that the QoL of PKU patients was comparable to normative data, but some aspects such as emotional health and school functioning were lower. Metabolic control was found to significantly correlate with QoL. Younger patients and men had better QoL in several studies, while late treated patients and those with lower education had worse outcomes. It is concluded that QOL in patients with PKU is similar to the general population. However, given the chronic nature of the condition, it is important to pay special attention to their QoL. Poor QOL is associated with female gender, lower education, older age, and poor metabolic control."

    "abstract": "The aim of this study is to present a series of case studies on the real-life use of pegvaliase in Italy in managing patients affected by phenylketonuria (PKU) and provide practical insight and support to healthcare professionals currently approaching and facing this novel enzyme substitution therapy. A panel of 11 PKU experts from seven leading Italian treatment centers attended online virtual meetings with the aim of reviewing their clinical and practical experiences with pegvaliase based on occurred cases. In selecting the cases, specific consideration was given to the nationwide representation of the centers involved and to the number of patients with PKU managed. Cases were thoroughly reviewed, with comprehensive discussions enabling the identification of key take-home messages regarding pegvaliase therapy. The panel discussed 18 cases, 11 males and 7 females (age range 17-43 years). At the last follow-up (up to 111 weeks after pegvaliase initiation), 11 out of 18 patients (61%) reached Phe levels below 600 μmol/l. Outcomes varied significantly across cases. All cases underscore the potential of pegvaliase in reducing Phe levels, enhancing the quality of life, and promoting social skills and independence. Additionally, the cases highlight the challenges associated with pegvaliase therapy, including managing adverse events and ensuring patient motivation and adherence. This is the first report about the Italian experience of managing patients affected by PKU with pegvaliase. Given the limited real-world data on the use of pegvaliase in PKU management, this case series offers valuable insights into the practical implementation and management of pegvaliase therapy in this Country. Continued research and data collection will be crucial to confirm and progress with this treatment. Despite potential challenges, pegvaliase therapy represents a substantial promise in managing PKU in Italy. Patient education, personalized treatment approaches, and careful monitoring are important to ensure optimal patient outcomes."

    "abstract": "We have generated using CRISPR/Cas9 technology a partially humanized mouse model of the neurometabolic disease phenylketonuria (PKU), carrying the highly prevalent PAH variant c.1066-11G>A. This variant creates an alternative 3' splice site, leading to the inclusion of 9 nucleotides coding for 3 extra amino acids between Q355 and Y356 of the protein. Homozygous Pah c.1066-11A mice, with a partially humanized intron 10 sequence with the variant, accurately recapitulate the splicing defect and present almost undetectable hepatic PAH activity. They exhibit fur hypopigmentation, lower brain and body weight and reduced survival. Blood and brain phenylalanine levels are elevated, along with decreased tyrosine, tryptophan and monoamine neurotransmitter levels. They present behavioral deficits, mainly hypoactivity and diminished social interaction, locomotor deficiencies and an abnormal hind-limb clasping reflex. Changes in the morphology of glial cells, increased GFAP and Iba1 staining signals and decreased myelinization are observed. Hepatic tissue exhibits nearly absent PAH protein, reduced levels of chaperones DNAJC12 and HSP70 and increased autophagy markers LAMP1 and LC3BII, suggesting possible coaggregation of mutant PAH with chaperones and subsequent autophagy processing. This PKU mouse model with a prevalent human variant represents a useful tool for pathophysiology research and for novel therapies development."

Pegvaliase (PALYNZIQ®) treatment has been approved to reduce blood Phe concentrations in adult phenylketonuria patients with uncontrolled blood Phe concentrations greater than 600 micromol/L on current management. However, data regarding individuals under the age of 16 is still unavailable. We report a 12-year-old Saudi girl who underwent pegvaliase therapy and was closely monitored for one year. Remarkably, a positive therapeutic response became apparent six months after commencing pegvaliase treatment. Phenylalanine (Phe) levels showed significant improvement, stabilising within the < 5 to 14 µmol/L range on a regular diet without any restriction. At her current age of 12, the patient maintains an unrestricted dietary regimen, consuming a diverse selection of foods, including poultry, meat, and protein sources, all while consistently maintaining normal Phe levels with no change in mental status after treatment. The parents gave their written, informed consent in allowing the research study to be carried out and clinical data to be published. This report addresses the potential broader applications of Pegvaliase in children, as well as its safety and tolerability in this age group. However, larger sample sizes and robust methodologies are required to validate such findings."

The current main treatment, dietary management, can prevent the symptoms if commenced early. However, it has side effects if used for a long time. Additionally, some patients with mild hyperphenylalaninemia (mHPA), who has serum phenylalanine levels <360 μmol/L, do not require treatment. Since the correlation between genotype and metabolic phenotype has been demonstrated earlier, genotype-based detection of patients who do not need treatment might help with genetic counseling and choosing the most appropriate treatment option. In this study, we report an asymptomatic adult with mHPA who had never taken any medical intervention to control or lower her serum phenylalanine level (Phe). She had 179 μmol/L serum phenylalanine level and carried p.[V230A];[V230I] genotype. Her child was affected with phenylketonuria and had p.[V230A];[V230A] genotype. Both pathogenic variants detected in the asymptomatic adult with mHPA were computationally analyzed to assess their pathogenicity and the p.V230I pathogenic variant was demonstrated to be responsible for the mHPA phenotype in the asymptomatic adult detected in this study. The findings in this study could contribute to genetic counseling and treatment for families and individuals with p.[V2030I];[V230A] genotype."

Studies evaluating patient preferences regarding the intake modalities of AA supplements are limited. This study aimed to collect real-world data regarding prescription adherence and intake modalities of AA supplements reported by PKU patients while monitoring metabolic control. This cross-sectional study included 33 PKU patients (16 female and 17 male) with a mean age of 27.2 years. Questionnaires were provided to assess information on AA supplement intake, such as prescription adherence rate, frequency and timing of administration, supplement formulation, and combination with food or drinks. Plasma phenylalanine levels were monitored during the study period. 51.5% (<i>n</i> = 17) of patients reported to lay within an adherence range of 75-100%. The majority of patients consumed AA supplements twice daily, with breakfast (87.9%) and afternoon snacks (51.5%). Powder supplements were most commonly used (72.7%) and often combined with milk and/or fruit juices (45.4%). Despite the known concerns related to treatment compliance among PKU adolescents and adults, most of the study participants reported a high level of adherence to AA supplement prescription. The personalized dietary regimens followed by the patients included in the current study represent a treatment approach that might be worth trying in non-compliant patients."

    "abstract": "Supplementation is crucial for improving performance and health in phenylketonuria (PKU) patients, who face dietary challenges. Proteins are vital for athletes, supporting muscle growth, minimizing catabolism, and aiding muscle repair and glycogen replenishment post-exercise. However, PKU individuals must limit phenylalanine (Phe) intake, requiring supplementation with Phe-free amino acids or glycomacropeptides. Tailored to meet nutritional needs, these substitutes lack Phe but fulfill protein requirements. Due to limited supplement availability, athletes with PKU may need higher protein intake. Various factors affect tolerated Phe levels, including supplement quantity and age. Adhering to supplement regimens optimizes performance and addresses PKU challenges. Strategically-timed protein substitutes can safely enhance muscle synthesis and sports performance. Individualized intake is essential for optimal outcomes, recognizing proteins' multifaceted role. Here, we explore protein substitute supplementation in PKU patients within the context of physical activity, considering limited evidence."

After PGT-M, unaffected (i.e., normal) embryos after genetic detection were transferred into the uterus of their corresponding mothers. A total of 43 carrier couples with the following hereditary neurological diseases or metabolic diseases dominated by nervous system phenotypes underwent PGT-M: Duchenne muscular dystrophy (13 families); methylmalonic acidemia (7 families); spinal muscular atrophy (5 families); infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy and intellectual developmental disorder (3 families each); Cockayne syndrome (2 families); Menkes disease, spinocerebellar ataxia, glycine encephalopathy with epilepsy, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, mucopolysaccharidosis, Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome, adrenoleukodystrophy, phenylketonuria, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Dravet syndrome (1 family each). After 53 PGT-M cycles, the final transferable embryo rate was 12.45%, the clinical pregnancy rate was 74.19%, and the live birth rate was 89.47%; a total of 18 unaffected (i.e., healthy) children were born to these families.

    "abstract": "Inherited phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency, also known as phenylketonuria (PKU), causes poor growth and neurologic deficits in the untreated state. After ascertainment through newborn screen and dietary phenylalanine (Phe) restriction to achieve plasma Phe in the range of 120-360 μmol/L, these disease manifestations can be prevented. Poor compliance with protein restricted diets supported by medical food is typical in later years, beginning in the late toddler and teenage years. Pharmacologic doses of oral tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4; sapropterin dihydrochloride) is effective in reducing plasma Phe in about 40-50% of PKU patients but effectiveness is highly variable. To assess the maximal responsiveness to 20 mg/kg/day oral BH4 as it affects plasma Phe and dietary Phe allowance in PKU patients. This was a single-center, retrospective observational study, combining case reports of individual patients. We reported an outcome of 85 patients with PKU who were trialed on BH4. Phe levels and dietary records of 19 BH4 \"super-responders\" were analyzed. Overall, 63.5% of the patients (54/85) were considered BH4 responders. However, we quantitated the dietary liberalization of 19 of our responsive patients (35%), those with at least a 2-fold increase in dietary Phe and maintenance of plasma Phe in treatment range. In these \"super-responders\", the mean plasma Phe at baseline was 371 ± 237 μmol/L and decreased to 284 ± 273 μmol/L after 1 year on BH4. Mean dietary Phe tolerance increased significantly from 595 ± 256 to 2260 ± 1414 mg/day (<i>p</i> ≤0.0001), while maintaining mean plasma Phe levels within treatment range. Four patients no longer required dietary Phe restriction and could discontinue medical food. The majority of patients had at least one BH4-responsive genotype. This cohort demonstrates the maximally achievable dietary liberalization which some PKU patients may expect with BH4 therapy. Health benefits are considered to accrue in patients with increased intact protein."

Important results are: 1) Many patients take less home samples than advised. 2) The majority of (parents of) PKU patients are (somewhat) dissatisfied with their home sampling method, especially with turn-around-times (3-5 days). 3) 37% of professionals are dissatisfied with their home sampling method and 45% with the turn-around-times. 4) All responders are positive towards developments for POCT: 97% (n = 332) of (parents of) patients is willing to use a POC-device and 76% (n = 61) of professionals would recommend their patients to use a POC-device. 5) Concerns from all participants for future POC-devices are costs/reimbursements and accuracy, and to professionals specifically, accessibility to results, over-testing, patient anxiety, and patients adjusting their diet without consultation. The PKU community is (somewhat) dissatisfied with current home sampling methods, highlighting the need for alternatives of Phe monitoring.

In the early stages, patients typically do not exhibit any symptoms, and HPA is identified only through newborn screening for diseases. It is important to distinguish BH4 deficiency from phenylketonuria (PKU, MIM # 261600). Timely diagnosis and treatment of BH4 deficiency are crucial for the prognosis of patients. We present two rare cases of Chinese Tibetan children with BH4D, diagnosed through biochemical tests and genetic sequencing. Case 1 is a male infant, 2 months old, with a newborn screening (NBS) Phe level of 1212 μmol/L (reference range <120 μmol). The biopterin(B) level was 0.19 mmol/molCr (reference range: 0.42-1.92 mmol/molCr), with a B% of 5.67% (reference range: 19.8%-50.3%). Gene sequencing revealed a homozygous missense variant [NM_000317.3 (<i>PTS</i>): c.259C > T (p.Pro87Ser), rs104894276, ClinVar variation ID: 480]. The patient was treated with a Phe-reduced diet and oral sapropterin, madopar and is currently 3 years and 4 months old, showing mild global developmental delay. Case 2 is a 40-day-old female infant with a Phe level of 2442.11 μmol/L and dihydropteridine reductase (DHPR) activity of 0.84 nmol/(min. 5 mm disc) (reference range: 1.02-3.35 nmol/min.5 mm disc.

At the age of 1 year, she exhibited severe global developmental delay with seizures. We identified and treated two cases of BH4D in Tibetan populations in China, marking the first confirmed instances.

Maintenance of blood Phe levels between 120 and 360 μmol/L reduces risks of birth defects. Sapropterin dihydrochloride helps maintain blood Phe control, but there is limited evidence on its risk-benefit ratio when used during pregnancy. Data from the maternal sub-registries-KAMPER (NCT01016392) and PKUDOS (NCT00778206; PKU-MOMs sub-registry)-were collected to assess the long-term safety and efficacy of sapropterin in pregnant women in a real-life setting. Pregnancy and infant outcomes, and the safety of sapropterin were assessed. Final data from 79 pregnancies in 57 women with PKU are reported. Sapropterin dose was fairly constant before and during pregnancy, with blood Phe levels maintained in the recommended target range during the majority (82%) of pregnancies. Most pregnancies were carried to term, and the majority of liveborn infants were reported as 'normal' at birth. Few adverse and serious adverse events were considered related to sapropterin, with these occurring in participants with high blood Phe levels. This report represents the largest population of pregnant women with PKU exposed to sapropterin. Results demonstrate that exposure to sapropterin during pregnancy was well-tolerated and facilitated maintenance of blood Phe levels within the target range, resulting in normal delivery. This critical real-world data may facilitate physicians and patients to make informed treatment decisions about using sapropterin in pregnant women with PKU and in women of childbearing age with PKU who are responsive to sapropterin."

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria is characterized by the accumulation of phenylalanine, resulting in severe cognitive and neurological disorders if not treated by a remarkably strict diet. There are two approved drugs today, yet both provide only a partial solution. We have previously demonstrated the formation of amyloid-like toxic assemblies by aggregation of phenylalanine, suggesting a new therapeutic target to be further pursued. Moreover, we showed that compounds that halt the formation of these assemblies also prevent their resulting toxicity. Here, we performed high-throughput screening, searching for compounds with inhibitory effects on phenylalanine aggregation. Morin hydrate, one of the most promising hits revealed during the screen, was chosen to be tested in vivo using a phenylketonuria mouse model. Morin hydrate significantly improved cognitive and motor function with a reduction in the number of phenylalanine brain deposits. Moreover, while phenylalanine levels remained high, we observed a recovery in dopaminergic, adrenergic, and neuronal markers. To conclude, the ability of Morin hydrate to halt phenylalanine aggregation without reducing phenylalanine levels implies the toxic role of the phenylalanine assemblies in phenylketonuria and opens new avenues for disease-modifying treatment."

This paper synthesises clinical practices from Italian specialist centres to delineate a unified approach for administering pegvaliase, a novel enzyme replacement therapy for PKU. Virtual meetings convened in September 2022, gathering a steering committee (SC) of experts from five Italian centres specialising in PKU. The SC reviewed, and discussed clinical practices, and formulated recommendations for pegvaliase treatment. The SC outlined a comprehensive treatment roadmap for PKU management with pegvaliase, emphasising the importance of multidisciplinary care teams, patient selection, pre-treatment evaluation, and education. Recommendations include initial hospital-based pegvaliase administration, regular monitoring of phenylalanine and tyrosine levels, dietary adjustments, and management of adverse events. A consensus was reached on the need for a digital database to manage treatment plans and enhance communication between healthcare professionals and patients. The expert panel's consensus highlights the complexity of PKU management and the necessity for a coordinated, patient-centred approach. The recommendations aim to standardise care across Italian centres and provide a framework for integrating pegvaliase therapy into clinical practice, potentially informing international guidelines. Further research is warranted to evaluate the long-term impact of these practices on patient outcomes and quality of life."

PKU is currently incurable, and management involves lifelong adherence to an unpalatable protein-restricted diet based on Phe-free amino acid mixtures. Seeking a palatable dietary alternative, we identified a Bacillus subtilis protein (GSP16O) with a well-balanced but low-Phe amino acid profile. We optimized the sequence and expressed a modified Phe-free version (GSP105) in Pseudomonas fluorescens, achieving yields of 20 g/L. The purified GSP105 protein has a neutral taste and smell, is highly soluble, and remains stable up to 80°C. Homozygous enu2 mice, a model of human PKU, were fed with diets containing either GSP105 or normal protein. The GSP105 diet led to normalization of blood Phe levels and brain monoamine neurotransmitter metabolites, and prevented maternal PKU. The GSP105 diet thus provides an alternative and efficacious dietary management strategy for PKU."

The delivery of telemedicine services instead of many face-to-face procedures has been expanded and, many healthcare services not directly related to COVID-19 treatments shifted online remotely. Many hospitals, specialist centres, patients and families started to use telemedicine because they were forced to. This trend could directly represent a good practice on how care services could be organized and continuity of care could be ensured for patients. If done properly, it could boast improved patient outcomes and become a post COVID-19 major shift in the care paradigm. There is a fragmented stakeholders spectrum, as many questions arise on: how is e-health interacting with 'traditional' healthcare providers; about the role of the European Reference Networks (ERNs); if remote care can retain a human touch and stay patient centric. The manuscript is one of the results of the European Brain Council (EBC) Value of Treatment research project on rare brain disorders focusing on progressive ataxias, dystonia and phenylketonuria with the support of Academic Partners and in collaboration with European Reference Networks (ERNs) experts, applying empirical evidence from different European countries. The main purpose of this work is to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the continuity of care for ataxias, dystonia and phenylketonuria (PKU) in Europe. The analysis carried out makes it possible to highlight the critical points encountered and to learn from the best experiences. Here, we propose a scoping review that investigates this topic, focusing on continuity of care and novel methods (e.g., digital approaches) used to reduce the care disruption. This scoping review was designed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for scoping reviews (PRISMA-ScR) standards. This work showed that the implementation of telemedicine services was the main measure that healthcare providers (HCPs) put in place and adopted for mitigating the effects of disruption or discontinuity of the healthcare services of people with rare neurological diseases and with neurometabolic disorders in Europe."

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an inborn error of amino acid metabolism. If untreated, PKU can result in global developmental delay, learning difficulties or seizures. For that reason, PKU is included in the UK neonatal screening programme. We describe a patient in his sixth decade presenting with progressive cognitive decline and spasticity, in whom a diagnosis of PKU was eventually reached. We note that although we currently have a robust neonatal screening programme, this has not always been the case. Patients born before 1969 were not screened, and tests used in early screening programmes were less sensitive than those used today. This case serves as a reminder that inherited metabolic disorders may present in later life and may mimic the neurocognitive and radiological picture of other white matter syndromes."

    "abstract": "The present study aimed to determine the problems, unmet needs and expectations of phenylketonuria (PKU) patients in Türkiye regarding follow-up and treatment in order to provide data for future planning and implementations on PKU. The study included patients diagnosed with PKU and/or their parents. They were informed about the study via phone calls and their verbal consents were obtained. Questions in the data collection forms, which were established separately for pediatric, adolescent, and adult age groups, were applied during the interviews and the answers were recorded. Among 182 classical PKU patients, 66 (36.3%) were in the pediatric group (0-12 years old), 44 (24.2%) were in the adolescent group (13-19 years old), and 72 (39.5%) were in the adult group (≥ 20 years old). In all patient groups, phenylalanine-restricted diet and medical nutrition products were the main options for treatment. The median of the last measured blood phenylalanine concentration (patient-reported) was 290 µmol/L, 425 µmol/L, and 750 µmol/L in the pediatric, adolescent, and adult groups, respectively. The frequency of blood testing for serum phenylalanine level according to the age groups was appropriate in nearly half of the patients. While the majority of the patients have been visiting the metabolism center they have been diagnosed with PKU for control, considerable proportion of the patients would like to change the center or the doctor they visit for control if they could. It was determined that nearly half of the patients had trouble in accessing the metabolism center. Treatment options' being limited and expensive were the major problems. The main requests of the patients and patient relatives included easier access to the metabolism centers and more options for treatment and diet. Access to the services should be easier to improve the patients' follow-up and treatment. There is need for low-cost, easily applicable, and accessible nutrition products and effective novel pharmacological agents. Focusing on these issues in health policies by providing pedagogic/psychological support, establishing support programs also comprising the families, and increasing the awareness activities were the key outcomes."

    "abstract": "Phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) has various applications in fine chemical manufacturing and the pharmaceutical industry. In particular, PAL derived from Anabaena variabilis (AvPAL) is used as a therapeutic agent to the treat phenylketonuria in clinical settings. In this study, we aligned the amino acid sequences of AvPAL and PAL derived from Nostoc punctiforme (NpPAL) to obtain several mutants with enhanced activity, expression yield, and thermal stability via amino acid substitution and saturation mutagenesis at the N-terminal position. Enzyme kinetic experiments revealed that the k<sub>cat</sub> values of NpPAL-N2K, NpPAL-I3T, and NpPAL-T4L mutants were increased to 3.2-, 2.8-, and 3.3-fold that of the wild-type, respectively. Saturation mutagenesis of the fourth amino acid in AvPAL revealed that the k<sub>cat</sub> values of AvPAL-L4N, AvPAL-L4P, AvPAL-L4Q and AvPAL-L4S increased to 4.0-, 3.7-, 3.6-, and 3.2-fold, respectively. Additionally, the soluble protein yield of AvPAL-L4K increased to approximately 14 mg/L, which is approximately 3.5-fold that of AvPAL. Molecular dynamics studies further revealed that maintaining the attacking state of the reaction and N-terminal structure increased the rate of catalytic reaction and improved the solubility of proteins. These findings provide new insights for the rational design of PAL in the future."

    "title": "Outcomes in 14 live births resulting from Pegvaliase-treated pregnancies in PKU-affected females.",
    "abstract": "Adults with PKU have difficulty maintaining plasma phenylalanine (Phe) in the range that is safe for neurologic function. Elevated plasma Phe is a risk factor for congenital anomalies and developmental delay in offspring resulting from pregnancies with poor Phe control in women with PKU. Enzyme supplementation with pegvaliase allows adults with PKU to eat an unrestricted diet and have plasma Phe levels in a safe range for pregnancy but pegvaliase has not been approved for use in pregnant females with PKU. We report the results of chart review of 14 living offspring of females affected with PKU who were responsive to pegvaliase and chose to remain on pegvaliase throughout their pregnancy. Fourteen pregnancies (one triplet pregnancy) and their offspring were identified at eight PKU treatment centers and medical records from pregnancy and birth were submitted for this study. Institutional Review Board approval was obtained. Responses to a dataset were provided to a single center and analyzed. Six females and eight males were born without congenital anomalies and all offspring had normal growth parameters. While mothers had preexisting comorbidities, no additional comorbidities were reported in the offspring. Four of eleven infants (excluding triplet pregnancies) were delivered preterm (36%), a higher rate than the general population (12%). A single first trimester (eight weeks) miscarriage in a 40y was not counted in this cohort of 14 live born infants. This retrospective study suggests that pegvaliase is effective at maintaining safe maternal blood Phe levels during pregnancy without deleterious effects on mother or child. A tendency toward premature birth (4/11; 36%) is higher than expected."

    "abstract": "Clinical advice may suggest discontinuing breastfeeding after the diagnosis of phenylketonuria in infants as the only effective way to monitor the newborn's intake and accurate measurement of phenylalanine (Phe). This study aims to investigate the prevalence and duration of breastfeeding, as well as its effect on serum Phe levels in infants with phenylketonuria at Education and Therapy Medical Center, Be'sat Hospital, Iran. We conducted a cross-sectional study of 34 children under two years old diagnosed with phenylketonuria between September 2018 and December 2022. Infants were categorized as breastfed and non-breastfed (bottle-fed) based on their feeding method after diagnosis. Data on age at diagnosis, medical records, demographic information, and anthropometric indices were collected, and infants with incomplete data or mixed feeding (formula + breast milk) were excluded from the study. Of 94 infants managed in our hospital, 34 had complete medical records. Among the all patients 13 (38%) continued to be breastfed combined with phenylalanine-free amino acid-based protein substitute, while 21 (62%) were did not receive breast milk. The mean duration of breastfeeding was 2.57 ± 0.59 (1-3) months. The mean age at diagnosis was 22.6 ± 18.4 days. Phenylalanine concentrations at diagnosis were mean 10, SD 5.44; range 4-24 mg/dL [0.22-1.33 μmol/L] in the breastfed group and mean 14.3, SD 10.2; range 5-37 mg/dL [0.27-2.05 μmol/L] in the non-breastfed group.Non-breastfed infants had lower serum Phe levels than breastfed infants: mean 3.76, SD 2.10; range 1-7 mg/dL [0.05-0.38 μmol/L] and mean 4.89, SD 3.68; range 2-19 mg/dL [0.11-1.05 μmol/L], respectively, although not statistically significant [(t (34) = 118.0, P = 0.51]. Also we found no significant associations in body measurements for weight, height, and head circumference at birth and final assessment. In conclusion, during treatment, there were no statistically significant associations between breastfeeding and serum Phe levels with growth in children with phenylketonuria."

    "title": "Fast Label-Free Metabolic Profile Recognition Identifies Phenylketonuria and Subtypes.",
    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is the most common inherited metabolic disease in humans. Clinical screening of newborn heel blood samples for PKU is costly and time-consuming because it requires multiple procedures, like isotope labeling and derivatization, and PKU subtype identification requires an additional urine sample. Delayed diagnosis of PKU, or subtype identification can result in mental disability. Here, plasmonic silver nanoshells are used for laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MS) detection of PKU with label-free assay by recognizing metabolic profile in dried blood spot (DBS) samples. A total of 1100 subjects are recruited and each DBS sample can be processed in seconds. This platform achieves PKU screening with a sensitivity of 0.985 and specificity of 0.995, which is comparable to existing clinical liquid chromatography MS (LC-MS) methods. This method can process 360 samples per hour, compared with the LC-MS method which processes only 30 samples per hour. Moreover, this assay enables precise identification of PKU subtypes without the need for a urine sample. It is demonstrated that this platform enables high-performance and fast, low-cost PKU screening and subtype identification. This approach might be suitable for the detection of other clinically relevant biomarkers in blood or other clinical samples."

    "abstract": "Dopa and tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) supplementation are recommended therapies for the dopa-responsive dystonia caused by GTP cyclohydrolase 1 (GCH1, also known as GTPCH) deficits. However, the efficacy and mechanisms of these therapies have not been intensively studied yet. In this study, we tested the efficacy of dopa and BH4 therapies by using a novel GTPCH deficiency mouse model, Gch1<sup>KI/KI</sup>, which manifested infancy-onset motor deficits and growth retardation similar to the patients. First, dopa supplementation supported Gch1<sup>KI/KI</sup> mouse survival to adulthood, but residual motor deficits and dwarfism remained. Interestingly, RNAseq analysis indicated that while the genes participating in BH4 biosynthesis and regeneration were significantly increased in the liver, no significant changes were observed in the brain. Second, BH4 supplementation alone restored the growth of Gch1<sup>KI/KI</sup> pups only in early postnatal developmental stage. High doses of BH4 supplementation indeed restored the total brain BH4 levels, but brain dopamine deficiency remained. While total brain TH levels were relatively increased in the BH4 treated Gch1<sup>KI/KI</sup> mice, the TH in the striatum were still almost undetectable, suggesting differential BH4 requirements among brain regions. Last, the growth of Gch1<sup>KI/KI</sup> mice under combined therapy outperformed dopa or BH4 therapy alone. Notably, dopamine was abnormally high in more than half, but not all, of the treated Gch1<sup>KI/KI</sup> mice, suggesting the existence of variable synergetic effects of dopa and BH4 supplementation. Our results provide not only experimental evidence but also novel mechanistic insights into the efficacy and limitations of dopa and BH4 therapies for GTPCH deficiency."

    "abstract": "Nanomaterials are widely used nowadays in industry and medicine. The specific properties of gold nanoclusters (Au NCs) are chemical stability, low cytotoxicity, low photobleaching, high sensitivity to the molecular environment. This set of properties allows to use Au NCs as nanosensors in bioimaging and diagnostics. We have investigated gold cluster complexes with proteinogenic amino acid phenylalanine (Phe). Detection of phenylalanine is essential for diagnostics of phenylketonuria, vitiligo, sclerosis, cancer, tuberculosis, etc. We have studied the complexes of Phe with Au<sub>n</sub><sup>q</sup> clusters with atomic number equal 1-6, 8, 20 and a charge equal 0-2. We have established that the clusters Au<sub>4</sub><sup>0</sup>, Au<sub>2</sub><sup>1+</sup> and Au<sub>3</sub><sup>2+</sup> form the most stable complexes with Phe among NCs with charge 0, +1 and + 2, respectively. Intracomplex interactions have been studied using Atoms-In-Molecules (AIM) theory and Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) analysis. It has been shown that metal-ligand intracomplex interactions are partially covalent and partially electrostatic. Also, we have simulated the UV-vis absorption and Raman spectra of the Phe-Au NCs. We have established that the clusters possess prospective features if being used for colorimetric and Raman detection of Phe. Au<sub>20</sub> cluster is remarkable for its six-times enhancement of the Raman signal. Moreover, our study provides insights into metal-ligand interactions for clusters synthesized inside a polypeptide globula. Hence, to the best of our knowledge this is a first attempt to perform a detailed analysis of Phe interactions with gold using quantum chemical calculations."

We analyzed the statistics on visits to Odimet<sup>®</sup> to evaluate its usefulness for long-term dietary management during a 5-year period focusing on three periods: pre-pandemic (15 March 2018-14 March 2020); pandemic 1 (15 March 2020-14 March 2021); and pandemic 2 period (15 March 2021-15 March 2023), in 120 patients with the following distribution: 84 patients with phenylketonuria (PKU); 12 with maple syrup urine disease (MSUD); 11 with urea cycle disorders (UCDs); and 13 with classical galactosemia. The evolutionary levels of their specific metabolic markers were evaluated, showing that globally, both pediatric and adult patients maintain a good metabolic control, even during a pandemic (median levels of phenylalanine in pediatric PKU patients 213.4 µmol/L and 482.3 µmol/L in adults; of leucine in MSUD patients: 144.2 µmol/L; of glutamine in UCDs: 726.8 µmol/L; and of galactose 1-phosphate levels in galactosemia: 0.08 µmol/L).

Currently, 14,825 products have been introduced (3094 from the general database, and 11,731 added by users to their own profiles). In 2023 63 emergency dietary adjustments in the studied intoxication-type pathologies were calculated in Odimet<sup>®</sup>.

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an autosomal genetic disorder caused by a deficiency of the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) enzyme. The lack of PAH results in the inability of phenylalanine (PHE) to transform into tyrosine (TYR). Consequently, this leads to the accumulation of PHE in the blood samples of newborns causing metabolic diseases such as irreversible neurological problems. An analysis was required for determining the values of PHE and TYR in blood samples from newborn babies. In this study, therefore, we developed a derivatized method to monitor PHE and TYR in plasma samples using liquid phase chromatography linked with quadrupole mass spectrometry. Accessible formaldehyde isotopes and cyanoborohydride were used to react with PHE and TYR amino groups to generate <i>h<sub>2</sub></i>-formaldehyde-modified PHE and TYR (as standards) and <i>d<sub>2</sub></i>-formaldehyde-modified PHE and TYR (as internal standards). We used tandem mass spectrometry for multiple reaction monitoring. We demonstrated a derivatized method suitable for the PKU screening of newborns. The recoveries for PHE and TYR were 85% and 90%, respectively. Furthermore, we compared the values of PHE and TYR in different human plasma sample storage methods, including direct plasma and dried blood spots, and the results showed no significant difference."

    "abstract": "Although early diagnosis and treatment prevent the severe impairments associated with untreated phenylketonuria (PKU), individuals with early treated PKU (ETPKU) nonetheless experience significant neurocognitive and psychological sequelae, including difficulties in working memory (WM) and increased risk of anxiety. The primary objective of the present study was to examine the extent to which anxiety may moderate the relationship between ETPKU and WM performance. A sample of 40 adults with ETPKU and a demographically comparable sample of 40 healthy adults without PKU completed a comprehensive assessment of WM performance and anxiety symptomatology. Data were collected using a variety of remote assessment methods (e.g., web-based neurocognitive tests, semistructured interview, report-based measures). The ETPKU group demonstrated significantly poorer WM performance as compared to the non-PKU group. The groups did not differ significantly in anxiety; however, high anxiety was more common in the ETPKU group (53% of sample) than the non-PKU group (33%). A significant interaction between anxiety, metabolic control (as reflected by Phe levels), and WM performance was observed for the ETPKU group. Individuals with high anxiety and/or high Phe levels (> 360 μmol/L) performed poorer than the non-PKU group. Individuals with low anxiety and relatively low Phe levels (< 360 μmol/L) performed comparably to the non-PKU group. Anxiety was found to moderate the relationship between Phe levels and WM performance in individuals with ETPKU. This finding underscores the importance of accounting for anxiety when evaluating neurocognitive performance in individuals with ETPKU whether for research or clinical purposes.

    "abstract": "Aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase deficiency (AADCd) is a rare autosomal recessive neurometabolic disorder caused by AADC deficiency, an enzyme encoded by the <i>DDC</i> gene. Since the enzyme is involved in the biosynthesis of serotonin and dopamine, its deficiency determines the lack of these neurotransmitters, but also of norepinephrine and epinephrine. Onset is early and the key signs are hypotonia, movement disorders (oculogyric crises, dystonia and hypokinesia), developmental delay and autonomic dysfunction. Taiwan is the site of a potential founder variant (IVS6+4A>T) with a predicted incidence of 1/32,000 births, while only 261 patients with this deficit have been described worldwide. Actually, the number of affected persons could be greater, given that the spectrum of clinical manifestations is broad and still little known. In our study we selected 350 unrelated patients presenting with different neurological disorders including heterogeneous neuromuscular disorders, cognitive deficit, behavioral disorders and autism spectrum disorder, for which the underlying etiology had not yet been identified. Molecular investigation of the <i>DDC</i> gene was carried out with the aim of identifying affected patients and/or carriers. Our study shows a high frequency of carriers (2.57%) in Sicilian subjects with neurological deficits, with a higher concentration in northern and eastern Sicily. Assuming these data as representative of the general Sicilian population, the risk may be comparable to some rare diseases included in the newborn screening programs such as spinal muscular atrophy, cystic fibrosis and phenylketonuria."

The effectiveness of this composite material as an electron transfer film in a new potentiometric membrane sensor for detecting phenylpyruvic acid (in anionic form) was demonstrated. Screening for this metabolic product of phenylalanine in body fluids is of significant diagnostic interest in phenylketonuria (dementia), viral hepatitis, and alcoholism.

    "abstract": "In the UK, Classical Galactosaemia (CG) is identified incidentally from the Newborn Screening (NBS) for phenylketonuria (PKU) using an \"Other disorder suspected\" (ODS) pathway when phenylalanine (Phe) and tyrosine (Tyr) concentrations are increased. We aimed to determine the efficacy of CG detection via NBS and estimate the incidence of CG in live births in the UK. A survey was sent to all UK NBS laboratories to collate CG cases diagnosed in the UK from 2010 to 2020. Cases of CG diagnosed were determined if detected clinically, NBS, or by family screening, as well as age at diagnosis. Cases referred via the ODS pathway were also collated, including the final diagnosis made. Responses were obtained from 13/16 laboratories. Between 2010 and 2020, a total of 6,642,787 babies were screened, and 172 cases of CG were identified. It should be noted that 85/172 presented clinically, 52/172 were identified by NBS, and 17/172 came from family screening. A total of 117 referrals were made via the ODS pathway, and 45/117 were subsequently diagnosed with CG. Median (interquartile range) age at diagnosis by NBS and clinically was 8 days (7-11) and 10 days (7-16), respectively (Mann-Whitney U test, U = 836.5, <i>p</i>-value = 0.082). The incidence of CG is 1:38,621 live births. The incidence of CG in the UK is comparable with that of other European/western countries. No statistical difference was seen in the timing of diagnosis between NBS and clinical presentation based on the current practice of sampling on day 5. Bringing forward the day of NBS sampling to day 3 would increase the proportion diagnosed with CG by NBS from 52/172 (30.2%) to 66/172 (38.4%)."

    "title": "The Impact of <i>IL1B rs1143634</i> and <i>DEFB1 rs11362</i> Variants on Periodontitis Risk in Phenylketonuria and Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus Patients in a Latvian Population.",
    "abstract": "Periodontitis is a multifactorial disease that affects approximately 11% of the global population. The objective of this study was to examine whether, among individuals with phenylketonuria and type 1 diabetes mellitus, those with the <i>IL1B rs1143634</i> and/or <i>DEFB1 rs11362</i> genetic variants exhibit a higher periodontitis risk compared to healthy controls. In all, 43 phenylketonuria patients (aged 12-53), 28 type 1 diabetes mellitus patients (aged 11-40), and 63 healthy controls (aged 12-53) were included. The evaluation of periodontitis risk was conducted using the Silness-Löe plaque index, the Greene-Vermillion index, and an assessment for the necessity of calculus removal. Genetic variants <i>rs1143634</i> and <i>rs11362</i> were genotyped from salivary samples using restriction length polymorphism analysis. The <i>DEFB1 rs11362</i> variant was associated with higher Silness-Löe and Greene-Vermillion index scores in phenylketonuria patients (<i>p</i> = 0.011 and <i>p</i> = 0.043, respectively). The <i>IL1B rs1143634</i> variant was associated with lower calculus removal necessity in type 1 diabetes mellitus patients (<i>p</i> = 0.030). Clinical examination showed the worst oral hygiene index scores for PKU patients. PKU patients also reported the least consistent tooth brushing and flossing habits. Genetic associations between <i>DEFB1 rs11362</i> and <i>IL1B rs1143634</i> variants and oral hygiene indices were observed in the PKU and T1DM groups, suggesting that genetic factors may contribute to periodontal health differences in these populations. Further research with a larger sample size is needed to confirm these findings and develop targeted oral health interventions."

    "title": "Interactions between Lipid Vesicle Membranes and Single Amino Acid Fibrils: Probable Origin of Specific Neurological Disorders.",
    "abstract": "Amyloid fibrils are known to be responsible for several neurological disorders, like Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), etc. For decades, mostly proteins and peptide-based amyloid fibrils have been focused on, and the topic has acknowledged the rise, development, understanding of, and controversy, as well. However, the single amino acid based amyloid fibrils, responsible for several disorders, such as phenylketonuria, tyrosenimia type II, hypermethioninemia, etc., have gotten scientific attention lately. To understand the molecular level pathogenesis of such disorders originated due to the accumulation of single amino acid-based amyloid fibrils, interaction of these fibrils with phospholipid vesicle membranes is found to be an excellent cell-free in vitro setup. Based on such an in vitro setup, these fibrils show a generic mechanism of membrane insertion driven by electrostatic and hydrophobic effects inside the membrane that reduces the integral rigidity of the membrane. Alteration of such fundamental properties of the membrane, therefore, might be referred to as one of the prime pathological factors for the development of these neurological disorders. Hence, such interactions must be investigated in cellular and intracellular compartments to design suitable therapeutic modulators against fibrils."

    "abstract": "We describe the complex case of a 44-year-old man with polycystic kidney disease, mild cognitive impairment, and tremors in the upper limbs. Brain MRI showed lesions compatible with leukodystrophy. The diagnostic process, which included clinical exome sequencing (CES) and chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA), revealed a triple diagnosis: autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) due to a pathogenic variant, c.2152C>T-p.(Gln718Ter), in the <i>PKD1</i> gene; late-onset phenylketonuria due to the presence of two missense variants, c.842C>T-p.(Pro281Leu) and c.143T>C-p.(Leu48Ser) in the <i>PAH</i> gene; and a 915 Kb duplication on chromosome 15. Few patients with multiple concurrent genetic diagnoses are reported in the literature; in this ADPKD patient, genome-wide analysis allowed for the diagnosis of adult-onset phenylketonuria (which would have otherwise gone unnoticed) and a 15q11.2 duplication responsible for cognitive and behavioral impairment with incomplete penetrance. This case underlines the importance of clinical genetics for interpreting complex results obtained by genome-wide techniques, and for diagnosing concurrent late-onset monogenic conditions."

    "abstract": "Breastfeeding or standard infant formulas, alongside phenylalanine (Phe)-free protein substitutes, constitute the dietary management for infants with PKU to guarantee protein requirements are met in compliance with metabolic tolerance. This work aims to analyse the nutritional composition of Phe-free infant protein substitutes, in terms of macronutrients, micronutrients and functional components, available for PKU dietary management in Italy. A total of seven infant Phe-free protein substitutes were included in this review, six powder and one liquid. A second analysis was conducted to compare them to the composition of formulas intended for healthy infants, taking into consideration the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/127 and Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/128 for micronutrients. The analysis revealed heterogeneity among protein substitutes suitable for infants with PKU. The energy and protein equivalents (P.Eq.) content are different; all of the substitutes contain docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and arachidonic acid (ARA), while eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS), galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS), human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) and nucleotides are not present in all the substitutes. More attention should be paid to these infant products to ensure metabolic control of PKU, and also promote proper growth, cognitive neurodevelopment, favourable gut microbiota composition, and immune system health, while reducing the risk for non-communicable diseases (NCDs)."

    "abstract": "Proteostatic regulation of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the rate-limiting enzyme in dopamine biosynthesis, is crucial for maintaining proper brain neurotransmitter homeostasis. Variants of the TH gene are associated with tyrosine hydroxylase deficiency (THD), a rare disorder with a wide phenotypic spectrum and variable response to treatment, which affects protein stability and may lead to accelerated degradation, loss of TH function and catecholamine deficiency. In this study, we investigated the effects of the TH cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin (BH<sub>4</sub>) on the stability of TH in isolated protein and in DAn- differentiated from iPSCs from a human healthy subject, as well as from THD patients with the R233H variant in homozygosity (THDA) and R328W and T399M variants in heterozygosity (THDB). We report an increase in TH and dopamine levels, and an increase in the number of TH+ cells in control and THDA cells. To translate this in vitro effect, we treated with BH<sub>4</sub> a knock-in THD mouse model with Th variant corresponding to R233H in patients. Importantly, treatment with BH<sub>4</sub> significantly improved motor function in these mice, as demonstrated by increased latency on the rotarod test and improved horizontal activity (catalepsy). In conclusion, our study demonstrates the stabilizing effects of BH<sub>4</sub> on TH protein levels and function in THD neurons and mice, rescuing disease phenotypes and improving motor outcomes. These findings highlight the therapeutic potential of BH<sub>4</sub> as a treatment option for THDA patients with specific variants and provide insights into the modulation of TH stability and its implications for THD management."

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU), a genetic disorder characterized by phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) deficiency and phenylalanine (Phe) accumulation, is primarily managed with a protein-restricted diet and PKU-specific medical foods. Pegvaliase is an enzyme substitution therapy approved for individuals with PKU and uncontrolled blood Phe concentrations (>600 μmol/L) despite prior management. This analysis assessed the effect of pegvaliase on dietary intake using data from the Phase 3 PRISM-1 (NCT01819727), PRISM-2 (NCT01889862), and 165-304 (NCT03694353) clinical trials. Participants (N = 250) had a baseline diet assessment, blood Phe ≥600 μmol/L, and had discontinued sapropterin; they were not required to follow a Phe-restricted diet. Outcomes were analyzed by baseline dietary group, categorized as >75%, some (>0% but ≤75%), or no protein intake from medical food. At baseline, mean age was 29.1 years, 49.2% were female, mean body mass index was 28.4 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and mean blood Phe was 1237.0 μmol/L. Total protein intake was stable up to 48 months for all 3 baseline dietary groups. Over this time, intact protein intake increased in all groups, and medical protein intake decreased in those who consumed any medical protein at baseline. Of participants consuming some or >75% medical protein at baseline, 49.1% and 34.1% were consuming no medical protein at last assessment, respectively. Following a first hypophenylalaninemia (HypoPhe; 2 consecutive blood Phe measurements <30 μmol/L) event, consumption of medical protein decreased and consumption of intact protein increased. Substantial and sustained Phe reductions were achieved in all 3 baseline dietary groups. The probability of achieving sustained Phe response (SPR) at ≤600 μmol/L was significantly greater for participants consuming medical protein versus no medical protein in an unadjusted analysis, but no statistically significant difference between groups was observed for probability of achieving SPR ≤360 or SPR ≤120 μmol/L. Participants with alopecia (n = 49) had longer pegvaliase treatment durations, reached HypoPhe sooner, and spent longer in HypoPhe than those who did not have alopecia. Most (87.8%) had an identifiable blood Phe drop before their first alopecia episode, and 51.0% (n = 21/41) of first alopecia episodes with known duration resolved before the end of the HypoPhe episode. In conclusion, pegvaliase treatment allowed adults with PKU to lower their blood Phe, reduce their reliance on medical protein, and increase their intact and total protein intake. Results also suggest that HypoPhe does not increase the risk of protein malnutrition in adults with PKU receiving pegvaliase."

In addition, the patient had low cerebral spinal fluid tetrahydrobiopterin (BH<sub>4</sub>) levels, suggesting dysfunction in the pterin biosynthetic pathway. As a result, the patient started on sapropterin, a BH<sub>4</sub> replacement small molecule. After sapropterin treatment, catatonia improved, and the need for ECT decreased. There was an improvement in her cognitive ability, attention and independence. However, there has been no improvement in seizure frequency."

    "abstract": "Gene therapy clinical trials are rapidly expanding for inherited metabolic liver diseases whilst two gene therapy products have now been approved for liver based monogenic disorders. Liver-directed gene therapy has recently become an option for treatment of haemophilias and is likely to become one of the favoured therapeutic strategies for inherited metabolic liver diseases in the near future. In this review, we present the different gene therapy vectors and strategies for liver-targeting, including gene editing. We highlight the current development of viral and nonviral gene therapy for a number of inherited metabolic liver diseases including urea cycle defects, organic acidaemias, Crigler-Najjar disease, Wilson disease, glycogen storage disease Type Ia, phenylketonuria and maple syrup urine disease. We describe the main limitations and open questions for further gene therapy development: immunogenicity, inflammatory response, genotoxicity, gene therapy administration in a fibrotic liver. The follow-up of a constantly growing number of gene therapy treated patients allows better understanding of its benefits and limitations and provides strategies to design safer and more efficacious treatments. Undoubtedly, liver-targeting gene therapy offers a promising avenue for innovative therapies with an unprecedented potential to address the unmet needs of patients suffering from inherited metabolic diseases."

Between April 2021 and April 2023, data obtained from the national newborn hearing screening program were examined for patients who presented to the pediatric metabolism clinic of Konya City Hospital with a clinical and genetic diagnosis of PKU. A healthy control group, matched for age and gender, was established. The newborn hearing screening test results, demographic information, and pregnancy data of infants with PKU and the control group were compared to assess risk factors. In the initial screening test, 23 out of 73 PKU infants (31.5%) and 12 out of 73 infants in the control group (16.4%) failed the test (p = 0.033). Among the 23 PKU infants who did not pass the first test, 9 (35%) also failed the second test and were referred. In contrast, all 12 infants in the control group who did not pass the first test passed the second test. The failure rate in the second test was significantly higher in PKU infants compared to the control group (p = 0.003). It was observed that the maternal age of PKU infants who underwent the second test was significantly higher than that of the control group (p < 0.029). Diagnostic hearing test results were found to be normal in all nine PKU patients who failed the secondary screening test and were referred to a tertiary center. In our study, it was determined that infants with phenylketonuria (PKU) who did not have any risk factors for hearing loss failed the hearing screening test significantly more than healthy infants."

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a genetic disorder that follows an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. Dietary treatment is the cornerstone of therapy and is based on natural protein restriction, Phe-free L-amino acid supplements (protein substitutes) and low protein foods. The aim of this project was to collect information about the clinical management of patients with PKU, focusing on understudied or unresolved issues such as blood phenylalanine (Phe) fluctuations and clinical symptoms, particularly gastro intestinal (GI) discomfort and sleep problems. The survey consisted of 10 open-ended and 12 multiple-choice questions that collected information about size of the PKU population in each center, the center's clinical practices and the outcomes observed by the center concerning adherence, clinical and biochemical abnormalities and clinical symptoms (GI and sleep). The questionnaire was sent to 72 experts from metabolic centers in 11 European countries. Thirty-three centers answered. The results of this survey provide information about the clinical practice in different age groups, concentrating on dietary tolerance, treatment adherence, and metabolic control. All the centers prescribed a Phe-restricted diet, with Phe-free/low Phe protein substitutes and low protein foods. Daily doses given of protein substitutes varied from 1 to 5, with adherence to the prescribed amounts decreasing with increasing age. Respondents identified that improvement in the flavor, taste, volume and smell of protein substitutes may improve adherence. Finally, the survey showed that clinical symptoms, such as GI discomfort and sleep problems occur in patients with PKU but are not systematically evaluated. Twenty-four-hour Phe fluctuations were not routinely assessed. The results highlight a strong heterogeneity of approach to management despite international PKU guidelines. More clinical attention should be given to gastrointestinal and sleep problems in PKU."

This study characterized the pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of 2 clinical sepiapterin formulations (Phase 1/2, Phase 3) and the effects of food on the pharmacokinetics of the Phase 3 formulation in healthy participants. In Part A, 18 participants were randomized to one of 2 treatment sequences, each with 4 dosing periods comprising a single dose (20 or 60 mg/kg) of the Phase 1/2 or the Phase 3 formulation with a low-fat diet. In Part B, 14 participants were randomized to one of 2 sequences, each comprising 4 dosing periods of a single dose (20 or 60 mg/kg) of the Phase 3 formulation under fed (high-fat) or fasted conditions. Following oral administration, sepiapterin was quickly absorbed and rapidly and extensively converted to tetrahydrobiopterin (BH<sub>4</sub>). BH<sub>4</sub> was the major circulating active moiety. Under low-fat conditions, the Phase 3 formulation was bioequivalent to the Phase 1/2 formulation at 20 mg/kg, while slightly lower BH<sub>4</sub> exposure (approximately 0.81×) for the Phase 3 formulation was observed at 60 mg/kg. BH<sub>4</sub> exposure increased to approximately 1.7× under the low-fat condition and approximately 2.8× under the high-fat condition at a dose of either 20 or 60 mg/kg for the Phase 3 formulation, compared with the fasted condition. Both sepiapterin formulations were well tolerated, with no serious or severe adverse events reported. All treatment-emergent adverse events were mild or moderate in severity."

Dietary therapy involves an elimination diet and Phe-free items, which may alter microbiota. The study examined the oral and intestinal microbiomes of a 63-year-old PKU patient and a control man, living in rural areas. iSeq100 (Illumina) sequenced the stool and oral 16S rRNA gene V3-V4 region. PKU guts had more Firmicutes and fewer Bacteroidetes than control. Clostridia predominated in PKU, while Bacteroidia dominated in control. Oral Bacteroidetes. Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Fusobacteria phyla were similar in both men. The microbiome may differ from those fed a Phe-free diet from birth due to late diagnosis and treatment of PKU. Due to the age of the 63-year-old patient's and late therapy, the results differ from earlier studies. No study has compared an older PKU patient's gut and oral microbiomes."

    "abstract": "Despite the acceleration of somatic driver gene discovery facilitated by recent large-scale tumor sequencing data, the contribution of inherited variants remains largely unexplored, primarily focusing on previously known cancer predisposition genes (CPGs) due to the low statistical power associated with detecting rare pathogenic variant-phenotype associations. Here, we introduce a generalized log-regression model to measure the excess of pathogenic variants within genes in cancer patients compared to control samples. It aims to measure gene-level cancer risk enrichment by collapsing rare pathogenic variants after controlling the population differences across samples. In this study, we investigate whether pathogenic variants in Mendelian disease-associated genes (OMIM genes) are enriched in cancer patients compared to controls. Utilizing data from PCAWG and the 1,000 Genomes Project, we identify 103 OMIM genes demonstrating significant enrichment of pathogenic variants in cancer samples (FDR 20%). Through an integrative approach considering three distinct properties, we classify these CPG-like OMIM genes into four clusters, indicating potential diverse mechanisms underlying tumor progression. Further, we explore the function of PAH (a key metabolic enzyme associated with Phenylketonuria), the gene exhibiting the highest prevalence of pathogenic variants in a pan-cancer (1.8%) compared to controls (0.6%). Our findings suggest a possible cancer progression mechanism through metabolic profile alterations. Overall, our data indicates that pathogenic OMIM gene variants contribute to cancer progression and introduces new CPG classifications potentially underpinning diverse tumorigenesis mechanisms."

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria is characterized by intellectual disability and behavioral, psychiatric, and movement disorders resulting from phenylalanine (Phe) accumulation. Standard-of-care treatment involves a Phe-restricted diet plus medical nutrition therapy (MNT), with or without sapropterin dihydrochloride, to reduce blood Phe levels. Pegvaliase is an injectable enzyme substitution treatment approved for adult patients with blood Phe >600 μmol/L despite ongoing management. A previous comparative effectiveness analysis using data from the Phase 3 PRISM trials of pegvaliase (NCT01819727 and NCT01889862) and the Phenylketonuria Demographics, Outcomes and Safety Registry (PKUDOS; NCT00778206) suggested that pegvaliase was more effective at lowering mean blood Phe levels than sapropterin + MNT or MNT alone at 1 and 2 years of treatment. The current work augments and complements the previous analysis by including additional follow-up from the completed studies, robust methods reflecting careful consideration of issues with the distribution of Phe, and alternative methods for adjustment that are important for control of potential confounding in comparative effectiveness. Median blood Phe levels were lower, and median intact protein intakes were higher, in the pegvaliase group (n = 183) than in the sapropterin + MNT (n = 82) and MNT (n = 67) groups at Years 1, 2, and 3. In the pegvaliase group, median blood Phe levels decreased from baseline (1244 μmol/L) to Year 1 (535 μmol/L), Year 2 (142 μmol/L), and Year 3 (167 μmol/L). In the sapropterin + MNT group, median blood Phe levels decreased from baseline (900 μmol/L) to Year 1 (588 μmol/L) and Year 2 (592 μmol/L), and increased at Year 3 (660 μmol/L). In the MNT group, median blood Phe levels decreased slightly from baseline (984 μmol/L) to Year 1 (939 μmol/L) and Year 2 (941 μmol/L), and exceeded baseline levels at Year 3 (1157 μmol/L). The model-estimated proportions of participants achieving blood Phe ≤600 μmol/L were 41%, 100%, and 100% in the pegvaliase group at Years 1, 2, and 3, respectively, compared with 55%, 58%, and 38% in the sapropterin + MNT group and 5%, 16%, and 0% in the MNT group. The estimated proportions of participants achieving more stringent blood Phe targets of ≤360 μmol/L and ≤120 μmol/L were also higher in the pegvaliase group than in the other groups at Years 2 and 3. Overall, our results indicate that, compared with standard therapy, pegvaliase induces a substantial, progressive, and sustained decrease in blood Phe levels - to a much greater extent than sapropterin + MNT or MNT alone - which is expected to improve long-term outcomes in patients with phenylketonuria."

Certain IEMs, like phenylketonuria (PKU), necessitate stringent dietary intervention that could lead to microbiome dysbiosis, thereby exacerbating the clinical phenotype. The objective of this systematic review was to examine the impact of PKU therapies on the intestinal microbiota. This research was conducted following the PRISMA Statement, with data from PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and Web of Science. A total of 18 articles meeting the inclusion criteria were published from 2011 to 2022. Significant reductions in several taxonomic groups in individuals with PKU when compared to the control group were detected in a quantitative analysis conducted across seven studies. The meta-analysis synthesis indicates a contrast in biodiversity between PKU subjects and the control population. Additionally, the meta-regression results, derived from the Bacillota/Bacteroidota ratio data, suggest a potential influence of diet in adult PKU populations (<i>p</i> = 0.004). It is worth noting that the limited number of studies calls for further research and analysis in this area. Our findings indicate the necessity of enhancing understanding of microbiota variability in reaction to treatments among PKU subjects to design tailored therapeutic and nutritional interventions to prevent complications resulting from microbiota disruption."

    "abstract": "Hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA), which includes phenylketonuria (PKU), is a genetic autosomal recessive disorder arising from a deficiency in the enzyme named phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH). Affected patients can experience severe and irreversible neurological impairments when phenylalanine (Phe) blood concentration exceeds 360 μmol/L (6 mg/dL). Here, we describe a female HPA patient who was born in Mexico to Cuban non-consanguineous parents and identified by newborn screening, and who bears the previously unreported <i>PAH</i> NM_000277.3(PAH):c.[229T>C];[1222C>T] or p.[Tyr77His];[Arg408Trp] genotype. At diagnosis, the patient showed a Phe blood level of 321 μmol/L (5.3 mg/dL), indicative of mild HPA. Neither of the <i>PAH</i> variants found in this patient had been previously reported in the mutational <i>PAH</i> spectrum of the Mexican population. The c.229T>C or p.(Tyr77His) <i>PAH</i> variant was previously related to mild HPA in the Swedish population. Our in silico structural analysis and molecular docking showed that mutated His 77 residue is located in the allosteric site of PAH at the interface of the two monomers. The PDBsum in silico tool predicted that this variant would cause minimal structural disturbance of the protein interface in the presence of Phe at the allosteric site. Docking studies revealed that these structural changes might be attenuated by the allosteric effect of Phe. Given the classic PKU phenotype conditioned by the \"Celtic\" or c.[1222C>T] or p.(Arg408Trp) <i>PAH</i> variant, which is the second variant in this patient, we propose that p.(Tyr77His) has a hypomorphic feature that could explain her mild HPA phenotype. Our results show the importance of following up on cases detected by NBS and the value of genetic studies and in silico tools that aid in the establishment of correct therapeutic strategies."

Under the protection of laws and regulations and the leadership of the national health administration, approved screening centers in public hospitals took the responsibility for publicity, screening, diagnosis, treatment, follow-up and management of birth defects. As of 2022, 31 provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities directly under the central government) have carried out NBS for phenylketonuria, congenital hypothyroidism, and hearing loss, 23 provinces have carried out screening for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (with a screening rate of 89.24%), and 24 provinces have carried out screening for congenital adrenal cortical hyperplasia (91.45% screening rate). Over the past four decades, screening techniques have evolved from bacterial inhibition, fluorescence analysis, and tandem mass spectrometry for the detection of biochemical markers to genetic testing, which has greatly contributed to the expansion of the types of diseases screened for. The combined use of metabolomics and genomics is currently being explored. Effective management and rigorous quality control of NBS are prerequisites for improving the quality and ensuring the accuracy of screening. The Quality Management System for Newborn Screening System Network (QMS-NBS), established by the National Center for Clinical Laboratories, covers all screening centers and related blood collection agencies. The operation of the QMS-NBS allows the quality and performance of screening to be transparent and measurable, ensuring the quality and efficiency of screening. This article provides an overview of the history of NBS, especially the evolution of policies for the NBS in China, the construction of screening institutions, the number of newborns screened, the incidence rates of screened diseases, the changes in screening technology, the expansion of new diseases screened for, and the quality control of NBS. Overall, the progress in NBS in China has not only benefited from the development and standardization at the technological level, but also benefited from the construction of policies, regulations and ethics."

Gene variations were checked by a customized Panel gene detection method. Blood phenylalanine-concentration and physical development indicators including height and weight were regularly monitored. Intellectual development was assessed using a neuropsychological development scale for patients aged 0-6 years and academic performance, and brain injury in patients was assessed using brain magnetic resonance imaging. c.728G>A, c.158G>A, c.721C>T, c.1068C>A, c.611A>G variations were common in <i>PAH</i> gene. The genotype of c.158G>A variation is compound heterozygous variation, with mainly a mild hyperpheny-lalaninemia. 168 patients with PAH deficiency who were followed-up regularly had normal physical development without dwarfism or malnutrition. Among the 33 preschool patients who underwent mental development assessment, 2 were mentally retarded and the initial treatment age was older than 6 months. Nine patients with an average age of (17.13±2.42) years completed brain magnetic resonance imaging, one case was normal, and 8 cases were abnormal. There were patchy or patchy hyperintense foci near the bilateral lateral ventricles on T<sub>2</sub>WI, and the intellectual development was normal. Compared with the other eight patients, the blood phenylalanine concentration of the normal child was better and stably controlled within the ideal range. c.728G>A, c.158G>A, c.721C>T, c.1068C>A, c.611A>G variations were common in <i>PAH</i> gene. After standardized treatment, most patients with PAH deficiency diagnosed by screening can obtain normal growth and intellectual development in adolescence, but there are different degrees of organic lesions in the cerebral white matter."

    "title": "Results of neonatal screening for congenital hypothyroidism and hyperphenylalaninemia in Zhejiang province from 1999 to 2022.",
    "abstract": "To analyze the results of neonatal screening for congenital hypothyroidism (CH) and hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA) in Zhejiang province from 1999 to 2022. A total of 11 922 318 newborns were screened from September 1999 and December 2022 in Zhejiang province. The blood thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels were measured by a fluorescence method and blood phenylalanine (Phe) levels were measured by fluorescence method or tandem mass spectrometry. TSH≥9 μIU/mL was considered positive for CH, while Phe>120 μmol/L and/or Phe/Tyr ratio>2.0 were considered positive for HPA. The positive newborns in screening were recalled, and the gene variations were detected by high-throughput sequencing and MassARRAY tests. The overall neonatal screening rate during 1999-2022 was 89.41% (11 922 318/13 333 929) and the screening rate was increased from 6.46% in 1999 to 100.0% in 2022. A total of 8924 cases of CH were diagnosed among screened newborns with an incidence rate of 1/1336. A total of 563 cases of HPA were diagnosed, including 508 cases of classic phenylketonuria (cPKU) and 55 cases of tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency (BH4D), with an incidence rate of 1/21 176. Ninety-seven out of 8924 cases of CH underwent genetic analysis. Gene mutations were detected in 9 CH related genes, the highest frequency mutations were found in <i>DUOX2</i> gene (69.0%) with c.3329G>A (p.R1110Q) (18.2%) and c.1588A>T (p.K530X) (17.3%) as the hotspot mutations. There were 81 <i>PAH</i> gene variants detected in a total of 250 cases of cPKU, and c728G>A (p.R243Q) (24.4%), c.721C>T (p.R241C) (15.0%) were the hotspot mutations. Meanwhile 7 novel variants in <i>PAH</i> gene were detected: c.107C>A (p.S36*), c.137G>T (p.G46V), c.148A>G(p.K50E), c.285C>T (p.I95I), c.843-10delTTCC, exon4-7del and c.1066-2A>G. There were 12 <i>PTS</i> gene variants detected in 36 cases of BH4D, and c.259C>T (p.P87S) (31.9%) was the hotspot mutation. The incident of CH has increased from 1999 to 2022 in Zhejiang province, and it is higher than that of national and global levels; while the incidence of HPA is similar to the national average. <i>DUOX2</i> gene variation is the most common in CH patients; c.728G>A (p.R243Q) is the hotspot mutation in cPKU patients, while c.259C>T (p.P87S) is the hotspot mutation in BH4D patients."

    "title": "Cerebral blood flow and white matter alterations in adults with phenylketonuria.",
    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) represents a congenital metabolic defect that disrupts the process of converting phenylalanine (Phe) into tyrosine. Earlier investigations have revealed diminished cognitive performance and changes in brain structure and function (including the presence of white matter lesions) among individuals affected by PKU. However, there exists limited understanding regarding cerebral blood flow (CBF) and its potential associations with cognition, white matter lesions, and metabolic parameters in patients with PKU, which we therefore aimed to investigate in this study. Arterial spin labeling perfusion MRI was performed to measure CBF in 30 adults with early-treated classical PKU (median age 35.5 years) and 59 healthy controls (median age 30.0 years). For all participants, brain Phe levels were measured with <sup>1</sup>H spectroscopy, and white matter lesions were rated by two neuroradiologists on T2 weighted images. White matter integrity was examined with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). For patients only, concurrent plasma Phe levels were assessed after an overnight fasting period. Furthermore, past Phe levels were collected to estimate historical metabolic control. On the day of the MRI, each participant underwent a cognitive assessment measuring IQ and performance in executive functions, attention, and processing speed. No significant group difference was observed in global CBF between patients and controls (F (1, 87) = 3.81, p = 0.054). Investigating CBF on the level of cerebral arterial territories, reduced CBF was observed in the left middle and posterior cerebral artery (MCA and PCA), with the most prominent reduction of CBF in the anterior subdivision of the MCA (F (1, 87) = 6.15, p = 0.015, surviving FDR correction). White matter lesions in patients were associated with cerebral blood flow reduction in the affected structure. Particularly, patients with lesions in the occipital lobe showed significant CBF reductions in the left PCA (U = 352, p = 0.013, surviving FDR correction). Additionally, axial diffusivity measured with DTI was positively associated with CBF in the ACA and PCA (surviving FDR correction). Cerebral blood flow did not correlate with cognitive performance or metabolic parameters. The relationship between cerebral blood flow and white matter indicates a complex interplay between vascular health and white matter alterations in patients with PKU. It highlights the importance of considering a multifactorial model when investigating the impact of PKU on the brain."

    "abstract": "Casein glycomacropeptide (CGMP) is a milk-derived bioactive sialyated phosphorylated peptide with distinctive nutritional and nutraceutical properties, produced during the cheese making process. It comprises 20-25% of total protein in whey products. CGMP is low in phenylalanine (Phe) and provides an alternative to Phe-free amino acids as a source of protein equivalent for patients with phenylketonuria (PKU). The amino acid sequence of CGMP is adapted by adding the amino acids histidine, leucine, tyrosine, arginine and tryptophan to enable its suitability in PKU. CGMP has potential antibacterial, antioxidative, prebiotic, remineralizing, digestion /metabolism and immune-modulating properties. The aim of this review is to assess the evidence for the role of CGMP in the management of PKU. In PKU, there is no agreement concerning the amino acid composition of CGMP protein substitutes and consequently the nutritional composition varies between products. Although there is evidence in patients or animal models that CGMP has possible beneficial effects on gut microbiota and bone health, the results are inconclusive. Data on kinetic advantage is limited. Most studies report an increase in blood Phe levels with CGMP. Appropriate adaptations and reduction of dietary Phe intake should be made to compensate for the residual Phe content of CGMP, particularly in children. Data from short term studies indicate improved palatability of CGMP when compared to Phe-free amino acids. In PKU, CGMP with supplementary amino acids, offers a safe low Phe nitrogen source. Current scientific evidence is unconvincing about its bioactive advantage in PKU. Further longitudinal research is necessary."

    "abstract": "To characterize adherence to Phenylketonuria (PKU) management practices among PKU patients treated at reference sites around Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico. This is a retrospective, observational, multicenter, and multinational survey-based study using aggregate data. From an initial list of 40 sites, 22 clinicians expressed interest in completing the survey, with 20 clinicians from 20 unique sites fulfilling all the study criteria. The Survey contained 28 questions, including respondent's clinic characteristics, clinic PKU treatment recommendations, and patient adherence to clinic recommendations. Survey was available in local languages, and the respondents were asked to consult their clinic records to complete their responses. Adherence was assessed by target blood phenylalanine (Phe), target blood testing frequency, and clinic visits. A total of 1077 (out of 1377) actively managed PKU patients (seen in the clinic in the last 3 years) from 13 clinics in Brazil, six in Argentina, and one in Mexico were analyzed. Upper blood Phe target was set over 360 μMol/L in 70% of the clinics for adult patients. Around 40% of the patients >30 years old had Phe blood tests done twice a year or less, with 60% of the clinics recommending semestral visits for adults <30 years old. Twice a month was the most common frequency of visits for <1 year old. The COVID-19 pandemic was a disruptor for frequency of visits and exams. These results show that there is still room for improvement in terms of adherence, namely in adults and older children. More efforts must be made to educate patients and healthcare professionals about the importance of treatment adherence, accompanied by public policies that expand access to pharmacological and dietary treatment with diversity and quality to improve adherence to adequate blood Phe levels."

    "title": "Micronutrient Deficiency in Inherited Metabolic Disorders Requiring Diet Regimen: A Brief Critical Review.",
    "abstract": "Many inherited metabolic disorders (IMDs), including disorders of amino acid, fatty acid, and carbohydrate metabolism, are treated with a dietary reduction or exclusion of certain macronutrients, putting one at risk of a reduced intake of micronutrients. In this review, we aim to provide available evidence on the most common micronutrient deficits related to specific dietary approaches and on the management of their deficiency, in the meanwhile discussing the main critical points of each nutritional supplementation. The emerging concepts are that a great heterogeneity in clinical practice exists, as well as no univocal evidence on the most common micronutrient abnormalities. In phenylketonuria, for example, micronutrients are recommended to be supplemented through protein substitutes; however, not all formulas are equally supplemented and some of them are not added with micronutrients. Data on pyridoxine and riboflavin status in these patients are particularly scarce. In long-chain fatty acid oxidation disorders, no specific recommendations on micronutrient supplementation are available. Regarding carbohydrate metabolism disorders, the difficult-to-ascertain sugar content in supplementation formulas is still a matter of concern. A ketogenic diet may predispose one to both oligoelement deficits and their overload, and therefore deserves specific formulations. In conclusion, our overview points out the lack of unanimous approaches to micronutrient deficiencies, the need for specific formulations for IMDs, and the necessity of high-quality studies, particularly for some under-investigated deficits."

    "title": "Natural Protein Intake in Children with Phenylketonuria: Prescription vs. Actual Intakes.",
    "abstract": "In phenylketonuria (PKU), an important component of the UK dietary management system is a 50 mg phenylalanine (Phe)/1 g protein exchange system used to allocate the Phe/natural protein intakes according to individual patient tolerance. Any foods containing protein ≤ 0.5 g/100 g or fruits/vegetables containing Phe ≤ 75 mg/100 g are allowed without measurement or limit. In children with PKU, we aimed to assess the difference between the prescribed natural protein intake and their actual consumed intake, and to calculate the natural protein/Phe intake from foods given without measurement or restriction. Over a 6-month duration, three one-day diet diaries were collected every month by caregivers of children with PKU at the beginning of a follow-up study. Dietary intakes of Phe, as well as natural and total protein intakes, were calculated using Nutritics<sup>®</sup> (v5.09). Weekly blood Phe spots were collected by caregivers. The target blood Phe level was ≤360 μmol/L for ages up to 12 years and ≤600 μmol/L for ages ≥12 years. Sixteen early treated children (69% females) with PKU were recruited. The median age was 11 years (range: 9-13), and most had classical PKU (n = 14/16). A median of 18 (range 12-18) one-day diaries and 22 blood spots were analysed for each subject over 6 months. The median prescribed natural protein was 6 g/day (range: 3-27), but when calculated, the actual median intake from all foods consumed was 10 g/day (range: 4-37). The median prescribed Phe was 300 mg/day (range: 150-1350), but the actual median intake was 500 mg/day (range: 200-1850). The median difference between the prescribed and actual natural protein daily intakes was +4 g/day (range: -2.5 to +11.5), with a median percentage increase of 40% for natural protein/Phe intake (<i>p</i> < 0.001). The median blood Phe level was 250 μmol/L (range 20-750), with 91% of blood Phe levels within the target range. Only one patient (11 years) had less than 75% of their blood Phe levels within the target range. The UK Phe exchange system provides flexibility in the dietary management of PKU. With this method, the actual natural protein intake was 167% higher than the prescribed amount. Although this led to a variable daily protein intake, the majority of children (n = 15/16) experienced no deterioration in their metabolic control."

    "abstract": "In PKU, the protein requirements are contentious. In 2018, we evaluated the protein intake in patients with PKU. Ninety-nine early treated patients aged 19.3 ± 8.2 years (54% males) were studied. A total of 24 had hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA), 48 mild and 27 classical PKU. All had an annual nutritional status evaluation. A total of 83% were on diet therapy only, and 17% were on diet with tetrahydrobiopterin therapy. Anthropometry, metabolic control and nutritional intake [total protein (TP, g/kg), natural protein (NP, g/kg), protein equivalent from protein substitutes (PE, g/kg)] were collected. TP adequacy (TPA) was calculated as a % of WHO (2007) safe levels of protein intake. Results were compared with the European PKU Guidelines (EPG). The median % contribution NP of TP intake was 53% [31-100]. Most patients (78%) had a TP intake above the EPG recommendations. The median TPA was 171% [146-203], with 79% [51-165] from NP and 84% [0-109] from PE. A TPA of 100-140% was observed in 16 (16%) patients. Only n = 6 (6%) patients had a TPA < 100%. These results emphasize the heterogeneity of PKU. More research is needed to understand the necessity of a single protein recommendation for all, as a 'one-size-fits-all' solution might not be appropriate."

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is the most frequent of the congenital errors of amino acid (AA) metabolism worldwide. It leads to the accumulation of the essential AA phenylalanine (Phe) and it is associated with severe neurological defects. The early diagnosis and treatment of this rare disease, achieved through newborn screening and low-Phe diet, has profoundly changed its clinical spectrum, resulting in normal cognitive development. We face the first generation of PKU patients perinatally diagnosed and treated who have reached adulthood, whose special needs must be addressed, including feeding through enteral nutrition (EN). However, recommendations regarding EN in PKU constitute a gap in the literature. Although protein substitutes for patients with PKU are offered in multiple forms (Phe-free L-amino acid or casein glycomacropeptide supplements), none of these commercial formulas ensures the whole provision of daily total energy and protein requirements, including a safe amount of Phe. Consequently, the combination of different products becomes necessary when artificial nutrition via tube feeding is required. Importantly, the composition of these specific formulas may result in physicochemical interactions when they are mixed with standard EN products, leading to enteral feeding tubes clogging, and also gastrointestinal concerns due to hyperosmolality. Herein, we present the first reported case of EN use in an adult patient with PKU, where the separate administration of protein substitutes and the other EN products avoided physicochemical interactions."

    "abstract": "Hemoglobinopathies are the commonest genetic defect worldwide (7% of the world's population has at least one hemoglobin mutation). Although prenatal screening for hemoglobinopathies is not obligatory during pregnancy in Italy, it is offered to women by the Italian National Health Service in the pre-conception phase. The screening of newborns is a valid alternative, and has been adopted in various European countries, albeit in a piecemeal fashion. Neonatal screening has the advantage of providing early diagnosis of a hemoglobinopathy. Here we report the findings from the experience with neonatal screening in Friuli-Venezia Giulia since 2010. The hemoglobinopathy screening project in Friuli-Venezia Giulia, a Region in north Italy, began in November 2010. High-performance liquid chromatography was performed on dried blood spot samples collected by obstetric nurses from neonates within 5-8 days after birth. From 2010 to 2019, 11,956 newborns were screened, and abnormal hemoglobin was found in 519 of them (4.34%): the variants identified included HbS, HbC, HbD, HbE and HbX. More specifically, the HbS variant was observed in 347 (2.9%) newborns and the homozygous pattern was identified in 24 (0.2%) cases. The screening also detected two cases of β-thalassemia major. We report our experience of 10 years of screening newborns for hemoglobinopathies in the Region of Friuli-Venezia Giulia, in which 7.7% of people come from malaria-endemic areas. Increased mobility and migratory flows bringing in hemoglobinopathy carriers from endemic areas have led to an increase in mutations in non-malarial countries, with a current incidence of around 4% in the newborns we tested. This means that hemoglobinopathies can be described as a rare condition. Our data show that incidence rates are comparable to those of other inherited disorders such as phenylketonuria, thereby justifying the inclusion of the test for hemoglobinopathies into screening programs for rare diseases."

    "abstract": "Inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) are a group of about 500 rare genetic diseases with large diversity and complexity due to number of metabolic pathways involved in. Establishing a correct diagnosis and identifying the specific clinical phenotype is consequently a difficult task. However, an inclusive diagnosis able in capturing the different clinical phenotypes is mandatory for successful treatment. However, in contrast with Garrod's basic assumption \"one-gene one-disease,\" no \"simple\" correlation between genotype-phenotype can be vindicated in IEMs. An illustrative example of IEM is Phenylketonuria (PKU), an autosomal recessive inborn error of L-phenylalanine (Phe) metabolism, ascribed to variants of the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene encoding for the enzyme complex phenylalanine-hydroxylase. Blood values of Phe allow classifying PKU into different clinical phenotypes, albeit the participation of other genetic/biochemical pathways in the pathogenetic mechanisms remains elusive. Indeed, it has been shown that the most serious complications, such as cognitive impairment, are not only related to the gene dysfunction but also to the patient's background and the participation of several nongenetic factors.Therefore, a Systems Biology-based strategy is required in addressing IEM complexity, and in identifying the interplay between different pathways in shaping the clinical phenotype. Such an approach should entail the concerted investigation of genomic, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics profiles altogether with phenylalanine and amino acids metabolism. Noticeably, this \"omic\" perspective could be instrumental in planning personalized treatment, tailored accordingly to the disease profile and prognosis."

    "abstract": "The cornerstone treatment of hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA) and phenylketonuria (PKU) is a lifelong low-protein diet with phenylalanine (Phe) free L-amino acid supplements. However, the PKU diet has significant shortcomings, and there is a clinically unmet need for new therapeutics to improve patient outcomes. CDX-6114 is a modified phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) enzyme obtained by a mutation in the <i>Anabaena variabilis</i> PAL sequence. CodeEvolver® protein engineering technology has been applied to improve the degradation resistance of the enzyme. In our first phase I trial, 19 patients were given a single oral dose of CDX-6114 at 7.5 g, 2.5 g, 0.7 g, or placebo in a cross-over design. After an overnight fast, patients received a standardised breakfast of 20 g of protein, thus exceeding the dietary recommendations for a single meal in patients with PKU. Plasma levels of Phe and cinnamic acid (CA) were measured over a 5-h period following CDX-6114 dosing. During the development of CDX-6114, a stability assessment using reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) assay revealed two peaks. The second peak was identified as CA. It was not previously known that as part of the mechanism of action, the CA remained associated with the protein following the conversion of Phe. Thus, recalculating the historical PAL enzyme amounts in CDX-6114 bulk substance was necessary. An updated extinction coefficient was achieved by applying a correction factor of 0.771 to previously reported doses. Postprandial plasma levels of Phe increased in all dose cohorts over time between 10% and 30% from baseline, although the actual peak of Phe levels was not achieved within the 5-h observation. When accounting for the interquartile ranges, these concentrations were similar to the placebo. As plasma levels of Phe were no longer a reliable marker for pharmacodynamics, the consistently detectable amount of CA seen in all patients who received CDX-6114 provided proof of the enzymatic activity of CDX-6114 in metabolising gastrointestinal Phe. Peak levels of CA were seen shortly after CDX-6114 intake, with a rapid decline, and remained low compared with the plasma Phe levels. This pattern indicates a short half-life, possibly due to the liquid formulation or the inability to withstand the lower pH in the human stomach compared with animal models in earlier studies. This was the first trial in patients with PKU to establish the safety and tolerability of CDX-6114. A single dose of CDX-6114 was safe and well tolerated, with no serious adverse events or presence of anti-drug antibodies detected. Efficacy will be explored in future trials using an optimised formulation."

However, little is known about potential differences in nutritional status and eating behaviors after transitioning from a phenylalanine (Phe)-restricted to an unrestricted diet. Here we assessed change in nutritional status in adults with early-treated PKU who were consuming a Phe-restricted diet (intact protein ≤0.8 g/kg/day) prior to starting pegvaliase. A 15-month, prospective, longitudinal study to assess change in anthropometrics, dietary intake, laboratory indices of nutritional status, bone mineral density (BMD), body composition, measured resting energy expenditure (REE), and eating behaviors between baseline and Month 15. Eleven adults (<i>n</i> = 7 female) aged 19.5-52.9 years completed the study. Six participants had a substantial blood Phe reduction (responders) and five participants had a modest blood Phe reduction (partial responders) by Month 15. Intact protein intake increased by an average of 49.4 g/day and 26.7 g/day in responders and partial responders, respectively. Plasma concentrations of most vitamins, minerals, and essential fatty acids assessed were normal, though micronutrient intakes decreased as participants decreased or discontinued PKU medical food(s). Responders had a more variable change in body mass index (BMI) and lean mass index (LMI) compared to partial responders, though there were no clear trends in BMD or body composition changes. Total protein intake was positively correlated with LMI. Responders, but not partial responders, self-reported increased in enjoyment of food and decreased food neophobia, uncontrolled eating, and emotional eating. Participants transitioning to an unrestricted diet while on pegvaliase maintained adequate nutritional status overall with no clinically significant changes in cardiovascular or glycemic markers. Responders reported improvements in eating behaviors, including reduced food neophobia, uncontrolled eating, and emotional eating, and increased enjoyment of food. There were no consistent trends in BMD, body composition, or BMI changes. A larger sample size and longer follow-up period are needed to further assess potential changes."

We describe two sisters born to consanguineous parents. The youngest sister (Patient 1), initially asymptomatic, tested positive at NewBorn Screening (NBS) for mild HPA. After variants in the <i>PAH</i> and BH4 related-genes were excluded, we performed <i>DNAJC12</i> genetic analysis and found a previously described homozygous deletion [NM_021800.3: c.58_59del p.(Gly20Metfs*2)]. The older sister (Patient 2), homozygous for the same variant and exhibiting mild HPA, was diagnosed subsequently and presented with ataxia and repeated falls, upper limb dyskinesia, intentional tremor, and mild intellectual disability. Patient 1 was started on treatment with low Phenylalanine (Phe) diet, BH4, l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine/carbidopa (L-DOPA) and 5-OH-Tryptophan, soon after diagnosis, and despite poor adherence to the dietary regimen, only manifested language impairment at last follow-up (age 5 years and 4 months). Patient 2, who started the same treatment at school age, experienced a minimal progression of neurological symptoms, with some improvement in her motor skills. These two new patients with <i>DNAJC12</i>-associated HPA, in addition to previous reports, point to DNAJC12 deficiency as a new metabolic syndrome that must be considered in patients with unexplained HPA."

    "abstract": "Pegvaliase, an enzyme substitution therapy, is a treatment option for phenylketonuria (PKU). Due to the neuropathophysiology and disease burden of PKU, individuals can experience baseline anxiety unrelated to pegvaliase therapy. In addition, there are aspects of pegvaliase therapy that may be anxiety-inducing for those considering or receiving treatment. The aim of this manuscript is to present best practice recommendations for the identification and management of anxiety symptoms that can occur along the pegvaliase journey. A modified Delphi approach was used to seek consensus among a multidisciplinary panel of experts. To this end, an in-person meeting was held that was preceded by a medical specialist- and patient-specific survey to develop preliminary recommendations on ways to address anxiety along the pegvaliase journey. After the meeting, an additional survey was conducted to rank the proposed solutions and mitigation strategies from which a set of recommendations was developed. All recommendations were voted on with the aim of consensus generation, defined as achieving ≥75% agreement among experts. The panel reached consensus on a total of 28 best practice recommendations for the management of anxiety during the pre-treatment, induction and titration, early maintenance (pre-efficacy), and late maintenance (post-efficacy) stages. The recommendations offer strategies to identify and address the most common causes of pegvaliase-related anxiety, including self-injection, side effects, the titration schedule, prescribed dietary changes, and variable time to efficacy. Overall, managing anxiety in those considering or receiving pegvaliase involves patient-centered communication, shared decision-making, and personalized treatment plans. The best practice recommendations described herein can guide healthcare providers in proactively addressing anxiety during the different stages of pegvaliase treatment, and support providers with initiating and managing pegvaliase in individuals who may experience baseline and treatment-related anxiety."

    "title": "A Synthetic Formula Amino Acid Diet Leads to Microbiome Dysbiosis, Reduced Colon Length, Inflammation, and Altered Locomotor Activity in C57BL/6J Mice.",
    "abstract": "The effects of synthetic, free-amino acid diets, similar to those prescribed as supplements for (phenylketonuria) PKU patients, on gut microbiota and overall health are not well understood. In the current, multidisciplinary study, we examined the effects of a synthetically-derived, low-fiber, amino acid diet on behavior, cognition, gut microbiome composition, and inflammatory markers. A cohort of 20 male C57BL/6J mice were randomly assigned to either a standard or synthetic diet (<i>n</i> = 10) at post-natal day 21 and maintained for 13 weeks. Sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene from fecal samples revealed decreased bacterial diversity, increased abundance of bacteria associated with disease, such as <i>Prevotella</i>, and a downward shift in gut microbiota associated with fermentation pathways in the synthetic diet group. Furthermore, there were decreased levels of short chain fatty acids and shortening of the colon in mice consuming the synthetic diet. Finally, we measured TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-10 in serum, the hippocampus, and colon, and found that the synthetic diet significantly increased IL-6 production in the hippocampus. These results demonstrate the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to future diet and microbiome studies, as diet not only impacts the gut microbiome composition but potentially systemic health as well."

    "title": "Inborn errors of amino acid metabolism - from underlying pathophysiology to therapeutic advances.",
    "abstract": "Amino acids are organic molecules that serve as basic substrates for protein synthesis and have additional key roles in a diverse array of cellular functions, including cell signaling, gene expression, energy production and molecular biosynthesis. Genetic defects in the synthesis, catabolism or transport of amino acids underlie a diverse class of diseases known as inborn errors of amino acid metabolism. Individually, these disorders are rare, but collectively, they represent an important group of potentially treatable disorders. In this Clinical Puzzle, we discuss the pathophysiology, clinical features and management of three disorders that showcase the diverse clinical presentations of disorders of amino acid metabolism: phenylketonuria, lysinuric protein intolerance and homocystinuria due to cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) deficiency. Understanding the biochemical perturbations caused by defects in amino acid metabolism will contribute to ongoing development of diagnostic and management strategies aimed at improving the morbidity and mortality associated with this diverse group of disorders."

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an inborn metabolic disorder characterized by excess accumulation of phenylalanine (Phe) and its fibril formation, resulting in progressive intellectual disability. Several research groups have approached from various directions to understand the formation of toxic amyloid fibrils from the essential amino acid Phe. Different parameters like the nature of the solvent, pH, Phe concentration, temperature, <i>etc.</i> influence the fibril formation kinetics. In this article, we have summarized all major findings regarding the formation of Phe-based fibrils in aqueous and organic media and discussed how non-covalent interactions are involved in the self-assembly process using spectroscopic and microscopic techniques. The toxicity of Phe-based fibrils is compared with other neurodegenerative peptides. It is noted that the Phe-based fibrils can also induce various globular proteins into toxic fibrils. Later, we discuss the different approaches to inhibit fibril formation and reduce its toxicity. The presence of polyphenolic compounds, drugs, amino acids, nanoparticles, metal ions, crown ethers, and others showed a remarkable inhibitory effect on fibril formation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first-ever etymological analysis of the Phe-fibrillar system and its inhibition to create a strong database against PKU."

    "abstract": "Correcting intestinal microecological imbalance has become one of the core strategies to treat chronic diseases. Some traditional microecology-based therapies targeting intestine, such as prebiotic therapy, probiotic therapy and fecal microbiota transplantation therapy, have been used in the prevention and treatment of clinical chronic diseases, which still facing low safety and poor controllability problems. The development of synthetic biology technology has promoted the development of intestinal microecology-based therapeutics for chronic diseases, which exhibiting higher robustness and controllability, and become an important part of the next generation of microecological therapy. The purpose of this review is to summarize the application of synthetic biology in intestinal microecology-based therapeutics for chronic diseases. The available literatures were searched to find out experimental studies and relevant review articles on the application of synthetic biology in intestinal microecology-based therapeutics for chronic diseases from year 1990 to 2023. Evidence proposed that synthetic biology has been applied in the intestinal microecology-based therapeutics for chronic diseases, covering metabolic diseases (e.g. diabetes, obesity, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and phenylketonuria), digestive diseases (e.g. inflammatory bowel disease and colorectal cancer), and neurodegenerative diseases (e.g. Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease). This review summarizes the application of synthetic biology in intestinal microecology-based therapeutics for major chronic diseases and discusses the opportunities and challenges in the above process, providing clinical possibilities of synthetic biology technology applied in microecological therapies."

    "abstract": "Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH<sub>4</sub>) deficiency caused by 6-pyruvoyl-tetrahydropterin synthase (PTPS) deficiency is a rare disorder that is one of the major causes of hyperphenylalaninemia in Taiwan. In this study, we reviewed the clinical courses of 12 adolescent and adult patients (7 females and 5 males) with PTPS deficiency. The patients were treated shortly after diagnosis through newborn screening with a combination of BH<sub>4</sub>, levodopa/carbidopa, and 5-OH-tryptophan. Their plasma phenylalanine and tyrosine levels were well controlled, and their prolactin levels were also decreased after treatment. However, their prolactin levels gradually rose as they grew into puberty, and at a current age of 27.5 [interquartile range (IQR 7.9)] years, five of the 12 patients had either highly elevated prolactin levels (> 100 ng/mL in one male patient, normal reference values, male < 11 ng/mL, female < 17 ng/mL) or symptoms, including irregular menstruation, amenorrhea, and breast swelling (in four female patients). The dosage of levodopa in these five patients (14.3 (IQR 3.0) mg/kg/day) was slightly higher than that in the other patients (p = 0.05). Magnetic resonance imaging studies did not reveal an increase in the size of the anterior pituitary gland, although a Rathke cleft cyst was found in one patient. Two patients received cabergoline treatment, which promptly lowered prolactin levels and relieved symptoms. Hyperprolactinemia is common in female patients with PTPS deficiency, especially after puberty. A long-acting dopamine agonist, such as cabergoline, may be a necessary adjunctive treatment for most patients with BH<sub>4</sub> deficiency."

There have been no previous studies utilizing BH4 as a supplement for ADHD. BH4 has been approved as a treatment for phenylketonuria (PKU). Individuals with PKU and ADHD appear to have low DA levels in common, suggesting that the hypodopaminergic state seen in both illnesses could be a relationship between the two. Clinical research involving supplementation of BH4 has shown low occurrence of adverse. In experiments, BH4 has also been found to have good blood-brain barrier permeability. BH4 also has the ability in scavenging ROS activity, which is an implication of stress and is seen in ADHD. BH4's significance in ADHD is reviewed in this paper because of its involvement in numerous neurodevelopmental metabolic pathways, and we anticipate that exogenous BH4 can be used to treat ADHD."

It was the first disease included in neonatal screening. Neonatal screening has allowed an early diagnosis and treatment of the disease. As a result, an increasing number of women diagnosed with phenylketonuria have reached the reproductive phase of life in good health, and management of pregnancy in women with PKU is becoming more frequent. In this study, we report the case of a 28-year-old Caucasian patient being followed up for phenylketonuria at Ramón y Cajal Hospital's Metabolic Diseases Unit. We describe the patient's gestation, impacted by her and her partner's diagnosis of PKU, classic and mild phenotypes, respectively, resulting in the fetus affectation. The description of PKU management-diagnosis, follow-up, and treatment-for both that of patient and that of the gestation with fetus affectation covers a wide sample scenario that shows the effectiveness of pregnancy planning and monitoring of females with PKU and questions the need to carry out a genetic study of gene PKU in the study of fertility."

    "abstract": "Measurement of plasma and dried blood spot (DBS) phenylalanine (Phe) is key to monitoring patients with phenylketonuria (PKU). The relationship between plasma and capillary DBS Phe concentrations has been investigated previously, however, differences in methodology, calibration approach and assumptions about the volume of blood in a DBS sub-punch has complicated this. Volumetric blood collection devices (VBCDs) provide an opportunity to re-evaluate this relationship. Paired venous and capillary samples were collected from patients with PKU (<i>n</i> = 51). Capillary blood was collected onto both conventional newborn screening (NBS) cards and VBCDs. Specimens were analysed by liquid-chromatography tandem mass-spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) using a common calibrator. Use of VBCDs was evaluated qualitatively by patients. Mean bias between plasma and volumetrically collected capillary DBS Phe was -13%. Mean recovery (SD) of Phe from DBS was 89.4% (4.6). VBCDs confirmed that the volume of blood typically assumed to be present in a 3.2 mm sub-punch is over-estimated by 9.7%. Determination of the relationship between plasma and capillary DBS Phe, using a single analytical method, common calibration and VBCDs, demonstrated that once the under-recovery of Phe from DBS has been taken into account, there is no significant difference in the concentration of Phe in plasma and capillary blood. Conversely, comparison of plasma Phe with capillary DBS Phe collected on a NBS card highlighted the limitations of this approach. Introducing VBCDs for the routine monitoring of patients with PKU would provide a simple, acceptable specimen collection technique that ensures consistent sample quality and produces accurate and precise blood Phe results which are interchangeable with plasma Phe."

As low-grade systemic inflammation increases cardiovascular risk, the INGRAPH study aimed to evaluate low-grade inflammation in adult PKU patients compared to healthy controls and to determine the potential influence of Phe-controlled diet on inflammation. Twenty early-treated adult PKU patients, including a subgroup of 15 classical PKU patients, and 20 healthy volunteers were included. PKU patients and healthy subjects were matched on age, sex and body mass index class. Plasma concentrations of CRP, IFNg, IL1a, IL1b, IL2, IL6, IL10, and TNFα were measured in PKU patients and compared to controls. Plasma CRP was not different in the PKU group as compared to controls. No significant differences were observed between the two groups concerning plasma cytokines concentrations. Plasma CRP and cytokine profile were not different between \"on diet\" and \"off diet\" PKU patients. All these results were similar considering only the classical PKU subgroup. No differences were shown in plasma CRP and pro-inflammatory cytokines between adult PKU patients and healthy controls. Further studies are needed, including more patients and extensive characterization of systemic low-grade inflammation, as cardiovascular risk appears to be a new concern in adult PKU population."

We found that upon delivery of a selected adenine base editor mRNA/guide RNA combination into mice via lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), there was sufficient PAH editing in the liver to fully normalize blood Phe levels within 48 h.

Using real-world data, we observed that despite dietary and medical interventions, most PKU individuals harboring at least one c.1222C>T variant experience chronic, severe Phe elevations and do not comply with Phe monitoring guidelines. Motivated by these findings, we generated an edited c.1222C>T hepatocyte cell line and humanized c.1222C>T mouse models, with which we demonstrated efficient in vitro and in vivo correction of the variant with prime editing. Delivery via adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors reproducibly achieved complete normalization of blood Phe levels in PKU mice, with up to 52% whole-liver corrective PAH editing. These studies validate a strategy involving prime editing as a potential treatment for a large proportion of individuals with PKU."

    "abstract": "Adults with PKU require life-long management, and ideally, their care should be in a specialised adult metabolic clinic. Their outcomes and co-morbidities have received much attention, but data are lacking on their experience, satisfaction and expectations about the care they receive. This survey reports the experiences and care adults with PKU receive from specialist metabolic clinics in the UK. The online survey developed by the UK NSPKU (National Society for Phenylketonuria), was placed on the NSPKU website from February 2021 to December 2022, and was completed by adults with PKU (≥18 years) or their carers/family members. Sixty-five adult PKU patients and 9 caregivers of adult patients completed the questionnaire (63% female in total). Only 32% of respondents were following a Phe-restricted diet with protein substitute intake as prescribed; the rest were partially adherent or not on dietary restrictions. Nineteen per cent (<i>n</i> = 14/74) had not been reviewed in clinic for two years. Half of the respondents (50%) described their experience in adult clinics as \"good\". Half of the patients were unable to contact their dietitians with questions or concerns, and only 24% considered that they received adequate support. Clinic reviews usually included anthropometric (82%) and dietary assessments (64%), discussion on management of PKU in daily life (78%) and a blood test (71%). Eighty-eight per cent reported they had at least one neurocognitive, mental health or behavioural co-morbidity but less than half of the patients reported an assessment on their neurocognitive functioning or mental health issues. Adult male patients appeared to have less detailed clinic review than females. Less than half (44%) of the respondents reported that they performed a blood spot for blood Phe at least monthly, but only 32% considered they had been informed about the risk of high Phe levels in adulthood. Although time, cost and stress related to travelling were barriers to a face-to-face review, more than 40% of patients had concerns about remote appointments. The frequency and extent of monitoring of adults with PKU, attending specialist adult services, were less than those specified by the PKU European guidelines. The care of women of reproductive age is prioritised over men. Adult metabolic health services require further attention, development and resources to provide a high standard and equitable service to patients with PKU."

Here, we report the development and testing of a fully integrated enzymatic colorimetric assay for the sensing of phenylalanine in blood samples from phenylketonuria patients. The platform works with a customized mobile app for data acquisition and visualization and comprises an electronic system and a disposable sensor. The sensing approach is based on specific enzymatic phenylalanine recognition, and the optical transduction method is based on in situ gold nanostructure formation. The phenylketonuria (PKU) smart sensor platform is conceived to perform self-monitoring on phenylalanine levels and real-time therapy tuning, thanks to the direct connection with clinicians. Validation of the technologies with a population of patients affected by PKU, together with the concurrent validation of the platform through centralized laboratories, has confirmed the good analytical performances in terms of sensitivity and specificity, robustness, and utility for phenylalanine sensing. The self-monitoring of phenylalanine for the daily identification of abnormal health conditions could facilitate rapid therapy tuning, improving the wellness of PKU patients."

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder caused by mutations in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene, resulting in phenylalanine accumulation and impaired tyrosine production. In Tyrosinemia type 1 (TYRSN1) mutations affect fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase, leading to accumulation of toxic intermediates of tyrosine catabolism. Treatment of TYRSN1 with nitisinone results in extreme tissue levels of tyrosine. Although PKU and TYRSN1 have opposite effects on tyrosine levels, both conditions have been associated with neuro-psychiatric symptoms typically present in ADHD, possibly indicating an impaired dopamine (DA) synthesis. However, concrete in vivo data on the possible molecular basis for disrupted DA production under disease mimicking conditions have been lacking. In pursuit to uncover associated molecular mechanisms, we exposed an established, DA producing cell line (PC12) to different concentrations of phenylalanine and tyrosine in culture media. We measured the effects on viability, proteomic composition, tyrosine, DA and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) levels and TH phosphorylation. TH catalyzes the rate-limiting step in DA synthesis. High extracellular levels of phenylalanine depleted cells of intracellular tyrosine and DA. Compared to physiological levels (75 μM), either low (35 μM) or high concentrations of tyrosine (275 or 835 μM) decreased cellular DA, TH protein, and its phosphorylation levels. Using deep proteomic analysis, we identified multiple proteins, biological processes and pathways that were altered, including enzymes and transporters involved in amino acid metabolism. Using this information and published data, we developed a mathematical model to predict how extracellular levels of aromatic amino acids can affect the cellular synthesis of DA via different mechanisms. Together, these data provide new information about the normal regulation of neurotransmitter synthesis and how this may be altered in neurometabolic disorders, such as PKU and TYRSN1, with implications for the treatment of cognitive symptoms resulting from comorbid neurodevelopmental disorders."

PKU patients were treated with a Phe restricted diet supplemented with a special formula containing l-carnitine (L-car), well-known antioxidant compound. The lack of treatment can cause neurological and cognitive impairment, as severe mental retardation, neuronal cell loss and synaptic density reduction. Although Phe has been widely demonstrated to be involved in PKU neurotoxicity, the mechanisms responsible for the CNS injury are still not fully known. In this work, we evaluated markers of neurodegeneration, namely BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor), PAI-1 total (Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 total), Cathepsin D, PDGF AB/BB (platelet-derived growth factor), and NCAM (neuronal adhesion molecule) in plasma of PKU patients at early and late diagnosis and under treatment. We found decreased Phe levels and increased L-car concentrations in PKU patients treated with L-car compared to the other groups, indicating that the proposed treatment was effective. Furthermore, we found increased BDNF levels in the patients under treatment compared to patients at early diagnosis, and a positive correlation between BDNF and L-car and a negative correlation between BDNF and Phe. Our results may indicate that in PKU patients treated with L-car there is an attempt to adjust neuronal plasticity and recover the damage suffered, reflecting a compensatory response to brain injury."

In this work, we documented an electrochemiluminescent (ECL) dual-mode sensor platform based on molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) modified closed bipolar electrodes for high sensitivity detection of L-Phe and D-phenylalanine (D-Phe). In the anode chamber of a bipolar electrode modified with phenylalanine imprinting, Ru (bpy)<sub>3</sub><sup>2+</sup> underwent a redox reaction to produce a chemiluminescence response under the stimulation of a driving voltage. At the same time, the reduction of the cathode film of the bipolar electrode was promoted, and the color changed from dark blue to nearly white. Thus, the dual-mode detection of target molecules is realized. The detection range of the sensor for phenylalanine reached 0.01-10,000 nM, and the detection limits of L-Phe and D-Phe were 3.9 pM and 4.6 pM (S/N = 3), respectively. This dual-mode system achieved high stability and high specificity, and also successfully realized the detection of actual samples, which is expected to achieve future clinical applications."

Examining Lu Yu's orphaned upbringing, clinical manifestations noted in his autobiography, dietary preferences, and the significance of his name, this study postulates that he may have had IMDs, notably PKU. His life choices, such as abstaining from meat and fish and favoring a low-protein diet during his time in a monastery, align with practices recommended for managing IMDs. The linguistic associations of his name further reinforce this hypothesis. This investigation sheds light on the intriguing possibility that Lu Yu may have been affected by IMDs, notably PKU. By considering historical context, clinical correlations, dietary choices, and name symbolism, we offer a unique historical perspective on this celebrated figure's health.

The study aimed to establish a cutoff level of the healthy term newborns. Materials and methods The study was a retrospective observational data analysis on a cohort of 1158 term newborns who underwent NBS in our institute. The percentile distribution of the NBS parameters was computed and the 99th percentile value was considered the new cutoff. For lower values, such as neonatal glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (nG6PD) and neonatal biotinidase (nBIOT), low percentile values were regarded as new cutoff value. Results Neonatal thyroid stimulating hormone (nTSH), nG6PD, neonatal immunoreactive trypsinogen (nIRT), and nBIOT showed a wide variation in the distribution. Most newborns had neonatal galactose (nGAL), nIRT, and nBIOT values above the median. The 99th percentile value of nTSH was 14.5 mIU/L, and that of neonatal 17-hydroxyprogesterone (n17-OHP) was 43.7 nmol/L. The 1.0th percentile value for nG6PD was decreased to 2.18 IU/gHb. The new cutoff values for nBIOT, nIRT, neonatal phenylketonuria (nPKU) and nGAL were 48.59 U, 95.3 µg/L, 2.3 mg/dL and 15.9 mg/dL. The mean and median nTSH values did not significantly differ (p=0.99) in the first five days of birth. On the contrary, the study population depicted considerably raised levels of n17-OHP on day 3, followed by a sharp decrease (p=0.029). Similarly, nIRT displayed significant differences in the first five days (p=0.017). Conclusion Using the 99th percentile values of the NBS parameters as the new cutoff levels might be beneficial in terms of the recall rates and cost burden."

    "abstract": "Phenylalanine (Phe)-restricted diet is associated with lower quality of life for patients with phenylketonuria (PKU), and a concern for caregivers of recently-diagnosed infants. Sapropterin is an oral drug used as an alternative or adjunct to dietary treatment. We have observed that some of the young infants initially managed successfully with sapropterin monotherapy have required dietary treatment in long-term follow-up. We aimed to determine the baseline factors associated with future initiation of dietary treatment in these patients. Data were obtained retrospectively from the medical records of 80 PKU patients started on sapropterin monotherapy before 3 months of age between 2011 and 2021. The patients were followed for a median of 3.9 years (Q1-Q3: 2.5-5.75 years). Sapropterin was tapered down and discontinued in 5 patients (6.3%) as their Phe levels remained below 360 μmol/L without treatment. Sapropterin monotherapy was sufficient in 62 patients (77.5%), while 13 (16.2%) required dietary treatment. Phe and tyrosine (Tyr) levels, and Phe:Tyr ratios differed significantly among the patients maintained on sapropterin monotherapy and those started on dietary treatment, but the Phe:Tyr ratio at diagnosis was the most important independent baseline variable (OR: 1.61, 95% CI: 1.15-2.27, p = 0.006), with Phe:Tyr ratio at diagnosis >5.25 associated with dietary treatment (sensitivity: 90.0%, specificity: 81.8%). Genotypic phenotype value (GPV), unavailable at baseline, was also associated with dietary treatment (median GPV 9.2 vs. 3.8, p = 0.006), but some genotypes were not specific to the final treatment modality. We propose that the Phe:Tyr ratio at diagnosis is an important indicator to predict dietary requirement in young infants initially managed with sapropterin monotherapy."

    "abstract": "For more than five decades, all newborns in Germany have been offered a screening examination for the early detection of congenital treatable diseases. Since its inception, about 35 million children have been screened in this way.Originally, screening exams only included early detection of phenylketonuria, which, without timely treatment, would lead to mental retardation that could no longer be corrected. The bacteriological Guthrie test allowed the detection of elevated concentrations of phenylalanine. The methods used today are the result of decades of development. They have been expanded to include tests to determine enzyme activities, immunoassays for the early detection of important hormonal disorders such as congenital hypothyroidism, and high-pressure liquid chromatography for the diagnosis of pathologic hemoglobins. The very sophisticated tandem mass spectrometry enables the simultaneous detection of amino acid and fatty acid compounds. Steroids can also be identified. The specificity can be further increased by combining tandem mass spectrometry with chromatographic pre-separation. In recent years, chemical-analytical analyses have been supplemented by genetic diagnostic methods such as quantitative or qualitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR).The current state of laboratory technology is by no means final. Both classical analytics and especially genetic methods are facing further rapid development. Although the expansion of screening is also a consequence of technical development, the inclusion of further congenital diseases is fundamentally dependent on the given therapy. But it is precisely here that many innovations are currently being investigated. Gene therapy is at the forefront of interest."

However, human breast milk contains Phe in varying quantities, and therefore, the effects breast feeding might have on infants with PKU needs careful consideration. To assess the effects of breast feeding (exclusive or partial) compared with low-Phe formula feeding in infants diagnosed with PKU, on blood Phe levels, growth and neurodevelopmental scores. The Cochrane Inborn Errors of Metabolism Trials Register, MEDLINE and Embase were searched (date of latest search: 9 August 2022). Studies were included if they looked at the effects of breast feeding in infants diagnosed with PKU compared with formula feeding. Predetermined outcomes included blood Phe levels, growth in the first 2 years of life and neurodevelopmental scores. Seven observational studies (282 participants) met the inclusion criteria. All studies compared continuation of breast feeding with low-Phe formula versus formula feeding only. While most studies concluded that there was no difference in mean serum Phe levels in their follow-up period, two reported that breastfed infants were more likely to have a normal mean Phe level. Two studies described no difference in mean weight gain after birth, while one found that breastfed infants were more likely to have higher mean weight gain. Two studies commented that breastfed infants achieved higher developmental scores in childhood as compared with formula fed infants. Although there are no randomised trials, observational evidence suggests that continuation of breast feeding and supplementation with low-Phe formula is safe and may be beneficial for infants diagnosed with PKU."

    "title": "Complete correction of murine phenylketonuria by selection-enhanced hepatocyte transplantation.",
    "abstract": "Hepatocyte transplantation for genetic liver diseases has several potential advantages over gene therapy. However, the low efficiency of cell engraftment has limited its clinical implementation. This problem could be overcome by selectively expanding transplanted donor cells until they replace enough of the liver mass to achieve therapeutic benefit. We previously described a gene therapy method to selectively expand hepatocytes deficient in cytochrome p450 reductase (Cypor) using acetaminophen (APAP). Because Cypor is required for the transformation of APAP to a hepatotoxic metabolite, Cypor-deficient cells are protected from toxicity and are able to expand following APAP-induced liver injury. Here, we apply this selection system to correct a mouse model of phenylketonuria by cell transplantation. Hepatocytes from a wild-type donor animal were edited in vitro to create Cypor deficiency and then transplanted into phenylketonuric animals. Following selection with APAP, blood phenylalanine concentrations were fully normalized and remained stable following APAP withdrawal. Cypor-deficient hepatocytes expanded from < 1% to ~14% in corrected animals, and they showed no abnormalities in blood chemistries, liver histology, or drug metabolism. We conclude that APAP-mediated selection of transplanted hepatocytes is a potential therapeutic for phenylketonuria with long-term efficacy and a favorable safety profile."

    "title": "Exploring factors impacting haplotype-based noninvasive prenatal diagnosis for single-gene recessive disorders.",
    "abstract": "Haplotype-based noninvasive prenatal diagnosis (NIPD) is applicable for various recessive single-gene disorders in proband families. However, a comprehensive exploration of critical factors influencing the assay performance, such as fetal fraction, informative single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) count, and recombination events, has yet to be performed. It is critical to identify key factors affecting NIPD performance, including its accuracy and success rate, and their impact on clinical diagnostics to guide clinical practice. We conducted a prospective study, recruiting 219 proband families with singleton pregnancies at risk for eight recessive single-gene disorders (Duchenne muscular dystrophy, spinal muscular atrophy, phenylketonuria, methylmalonic acidemia, hemophilia A, hemophilia B, non-syndromic hearing loss, and congenital adrenal hyperplasia) at 7-14 weeks of gestation. Haplotype-based NIPD was performed by evaluating the relative haplotype dosage (RHDO) in maternal circulation, and the results were validated via invasive prenatal diagnosis or newborn follow-ups. Among the 219 families, the median gestational age at first blood draw was 8<sup>+5</sup> weeks. Initial testing succeeded for 190 families and failed for 29 due to low fetal fraction (16), insufficient informative SNPs (9), and homologous recombination near pathogenic variation (4). Among low fetal fraction families, successful testing was achieved for 11 cases after a redraw, while 5 remained inconclusive. Test failures linked to insufficient informative SNPs correlated with linkage disequilibrium near the genes, with F8 and MMUT exhibiting the highest associated failure rates (14.3% and 25%, respectively). Homologous recombination was relatively frequent around the DMD and SMN1 genes (8.8% and 4.8%, respectively) but led to detection failure in only 44.4% (4/9) of such cases. All NIPD results from the 201 successful families were consistent with invasive diagnostic findings or newborn follow-up. Fetal fraction, informative SNPs count, and homologous recombination are pivotal to NIPD performance. Redrawing blood effectively improves the success rate for low fetal fraction samples. However, informative SNPs count and homologous recombination rates vary significantly across genes, necessitating careful consideration in clinical practice. We have designed an in silico method based on linkage disequilibrium data to predict the number of informative SNPs. This can identify genomic regions where there might be an insufficient number of SNPs, thereby guiding panel design. With these factors properly accounted for, NIPD is highly accurate and reliable."

    "abstract": "Hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA) is a metabolic disorder classified into phenylalanine-4-hydroxylase (PAH) and non-PAH deficiency. The latter is produced by mutations in genes involved in the tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) biosynthesis pathway and DNAJC12 pathogenetic variants. The BH4 metabolism, including de novo biosynthesis involved genes (i.e., guanosine 5'-triphosphate cyclohydrolase I (GTPCH/GCH1), sepiapterin reductase (SR/SPR), 6-pyruvoyl-tetrahydropterin synthase (PTPS/PTS)), and two genes that play roles in cofactor regeneration pathway (i.e., dihydropteridine reductase (DHPR/QDPR) and pterin-4α-carbinolamine dehydratase (PCD/PCBD1)). The subsequent systemic hyperphenylalaninemia and monoamine neurotransmitter deficiency lead to neurological consequences. The high rate of consanguineous marriages in Iran substantially increases the incidence of BH4 deficiency. We utilized the Sanger sequencing technique in this study to investigate 14 Iranian patients with non-PAH deficiency. All affected subjects in this study had HPA and no mutation was detected in their PAH gene. We successfully identified six mutant alleles in BH4-deficiency-associated genes, including three novel mutations: one in QDPR, one in PTS, and one in the PCBD1 gene, thus giving a definite diagnosis to these patients. In this light, appropriate patient management may follow. The clinical effect of reported variants is essential for genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis in the patients' families and significant for the improvement of precision medicine."

    "title": "Health status and comorbidities of adult patients with late-diagnosed phenylketonuria (PKU) born before the newborn screening in France - A nationwide study of health insurance claims data.",
    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an inborn error of metabolism. When diagnosed late, it causes developmental delay or severe irreversible intellectual disability. This study aimed at evaluating the health status and healthcare consumption of late-diagnosed PKU patients in France. This retrospective observational study used health insurance claims data from the French SNDS (Système National des Données de Santé) database, which contains data from over 66 million French inhabitants. Patients with PKU were identified between 2006 and 2018 by ICD-10 diagnosis codes E70.0 / E70.1 documented as a chronic condition (affection de longue durée - ALD) or in the inpatient setting. Patients with PKU were matched to controls by age, sex, and region. Patients with late-diagnosed PKU were defined as patients born before the nationwide implementation of newborn screening in France in 1972. Outcomes were analyzed for the year 2018. In total, 3549 patients with PKU were identified in the database on January 1st, 2018. Of those, 3469 patients could be matched to 17,170 controls without PKU. Of these, 2175 patients were at least 16 years old of whom 647 patients were categorized as late-diagnosed. The late-diagnosed PKU patients suffered significantly more often from hypertension (60.9% vs. 50.4%, p < 0.0001), hypercholesterolemia (41.7% vs. 26.9%, p < 0.0001), diabetes (24.4% vs. 14.1%, p < 0.0001), depression (20.6% vs. 13.8%, p < 0.0001), ischemic heart disease (16.1% vs. 6.6%, p < 0.0001), obesity (7.9% vs. 2.5%, inpatient diagnoses only, p < 0.0001), and chronic kidney disease (5.2% vs. 1.3%, inpatient diagnoses only, p < 0.0001) compared with their non-PKU controls. Consequently, significantly more patients with late-diagnosed PKU received medication to treat comorbidities associated with the nervous (82.6% vs 77.0%; p = 0.0021) and cardiovascular system (69.5% vs 58.0%; p < 0.0001). Overall, only 3.4% of patients with late-diagnosed PKU received dietary amino-acid supplements and 0.7% received sapropterin. The results indicate that PKU is associated with a significantly higher risk of comorbidities along with increased pharmaceutical prescriptions in patients with late-diagnosed PKU, compared with non-PKU controls. The increased risk of comorbidities was more pronounced than in patients with early-diagnosed PKU, as shown in previous research, but these patients are older than those with early-diagnosed PKU. Only few late-diagnosed patients were treated specifically for PKU. Patients with late-diagnosed PKU should be referred to specialized centers to prevent and manage comordities and introduce PKU-specific treatment when it is possible."

    "title": "Possible role of tryptophan metabolism along the microbiota-gut-brain axis on cognitive & behavioral aspects in Phenylketonuria.",
    "abstract": "Cognitive and psychiatric disorders are well documented across the lifetime of patients with inborn errors of metabolism (IEMs). Gut microbiota impacts behavior and cognitive functions through the gut-brain axis (GBA). According to recent research, a broad spectrum of GBA disorders may be influenced by a perturbed Tryptophan (Trp) metabolism and are associated with alterations in composition or function of the gut microbiota. Furthermore, early-life diets may influence children's neurodevelopment and cognitive deficits in adulthood. In Phenylketonuria (PKU), since the main therapeutic intervention is based on a life-long restrictive diet, important alterations of gut microbiota have been observed. Studies on PKU highlight the impact of alterations of gut microbiota on the central nervous system (CNS), also investigating the involvement of metabolic pathways, such as Trp and kynurenine (KYN) metabolisms, involved in numerous neurodegenerative disorders. An alteration of Trp metabolism with an imbalance of the KYN pathway towards the production of neurotoxic metabolites implicated in numerous neurodegenerative and inflammatory diseases has been observed in PKU patients supplemented with Phe-free amino acid medical foods (AA-MF). The present review investigates the possible link between gut microbiota and the brain in IEMs, focusing on Trp metabolism in PKU. Considering the evidence collected, cognitive and behavioral well-being should always be monitored in routine IEMs clinical management. Further studies are required to evaluate the possible impact of Trp metabolism, through gut microbiota, on cognitive and behavioral functions in IEMs, to identify innovative dietetic strategies and improve quality of life and mental health of these patients."

    "abstract": "Dietary treatment is the main therapy for most patients with phenylketonuria (PKU). Parental knowledge regarding food selection is crucial to ensure adequate metabolic control and brain development during childhood and to promote lifelong adherence and healthy dietary behavior in the offspring. The aims of this study were to assess whether parental or caregiver knowledge regarding nutritional selection for children with PKU is in accordance with medical recommendations and to evaluate factors that influence their level of knowledge. This was a cross-sectional observational study. An online or paper survey (N = 178) was distributed throughout the United States. The survey included a validated food selection questionnaire to assess whether the respondent adequately identified foods that require certain restrictions versus foods that can be consumed freely by an individual with PKU. General knowledge of food selection among the caregivers was very high or high in nearly 60% (60-98th score percentile). Participants with the lowest scores in general knowledge of the PKU diet (quartile 1) were more likely to label allowed foods incorrectly. Respondents with the highest scores (quartile 4) were more likely to label limited foods correctly but incorrectly label allowed items. Knowledge of restricted foods is important to avoid poor metabolic control, but knowledge of allowed foods can be just as important to allow for a diet that is diverse, palatable, and nutritionally balanced."

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria represents the most prevalent inborn error of amino acid metabolism. In early diagnosed patients adequate and continued dietary treatment results in a good neurologic outcome. However, due to the natural protein and phenylalanine-restricted diet, oxidative stress represents a concern in phenylketonuric patients. Clear evidences suggest that the pathophysiology of PKU is also dependent by mitochondrial impairment and oxidative stress. In this context due to the tight connection between oxidative and inflammatory stress and noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) development, it is reasonable to hypothesize that PKU patients may present a higher risk to develop NCDs during their life. Currently available protein substitutes on the market include free amino acids (L-AAs), prolonged-release protein substitute and formula containing glycomacropeptide (GMP). Our results suggest that free L-AAs significanlty worsens the intestinal hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2)</sub> and lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced oxidative and inflammatory status in Caco-2 cells, which are significantly restored towards physiological condition by GMP alone and when present in a 1:1 mixture with free L-AAs, providing new preclinical piece of information which can shed a shadow on the mechanism of action of these products on PKU patients and their future management."

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a metabolic condition that requires treatment for life. There is increasing evidence that chronic illnesses put strain on relationships and marriages. However, no studies have examined the unique factors that metabolic conditions have on affected individuals and their relationship satisfaction. We surveyed a population of adult patients with PKU and assessed how management, treatment, and lifestyle factors impact their relationship satisfaction. The purpose of our study was to explore whether factors such as involvement of partner in PKU management, impact of challenges unique to PKU (e.g., diet, family planning, mood disturbances), and PKU treatment types were associated with the degree of relationship satisfaction. We surveyed adult patients with PKU (n = 82) who were either currently in or had previously been in a long-term relationship. We developed a 78-question survey that included unique questions regarding lifestyle, treatment, and management of their PKU in addition to a validated Relationship Assessment Score. Questions included single choice, multiple choice, and 3 open-ended questions. We found that higher relationship satisfaction was associated with increased partner involvement, increased health, and adherence to recommended PKU treatments. Participants utilizing both diet and pharmaceutical treatment had the highest relationship satisfaction. Finally, participants who reported that their PKU did not contribute to the ending of a previous relationship reported higher relationship satisfaction scores. This study suggests that involvement of partners in the management and treatment of a chronic illness and adherence to recommended treatments can significantly improve relationship satisfaction."

Separation of the analytes was accomplished using a Discovery HS F5-3 column, which offered better retention and peak symmetry for the tested analytes. Chromatographic conditions were optimized using central composite experimental design, and three factors were investigated: the concentration of ammonium acetate (A), the acetonitrile proportion in the mobile phase (B) and the column oven temperature (C). The approach was verified using β-expectation tolerance intervals for total error measurement that did not exceed 15%. Optimal settings were A = 50 mm, B = 24% and C = 28°C. The method applicability was determined using human plasma from 75 volunteers. The limits of detection and quantification of the technique were satisfactory at 9 and 29 μm for Phe and 4 and 13 μm for Tyr. The mean analytical bias in spiking levels was acceptable, ranging from -1.649 to +1.659% for both substances, with RSD <5% in all instances. The suggested approach was successfully used to analyze Phe and Tyr in human blood samples and calculate the Phe/Tyr ratio."

We aimed to identify the risk factors for noncommunicable diseases that may arise from nutritional therapies and suggests approaches that may prevent the development of the noncommunicable diseases. The present study evaluates 112 patients, on long-term nutritional therapy for at least the last 2 years with a diagnosis of an inborn error of the amino acid metabolism, and their 28 healthy siblings. The participants are assessed for the development of overweight and metabolic syndrome based on an analysis of anthropometric parameters, body composition and the results of biochemical tests. Anthropometric measurements including BMI, weight Z-score, waist circumference and fat mass were not significantly different between patients and controls. Height Z-scores were similar in phenylketonuria patients compared to controls, but lower in urea cycle disorders, organic acidemia and maple syrup urine disease groups. No increased risk of development of overweight or metabolic syndrome was detected in the patient group, while there were findings suggesting malnutrition in patients diagnosed with urea cycle disorders. There was a correlation between patients' BMI and C3-carnitine levels in organic acidemia patients and leucine levels in maple syrup urine disease patients. All forms of malnutrition can be prevented in patient groups receiving limited nutrients under a dietary management protocol, based on the findings of anthropometric and biochemical evaluations and analyses of body composition."

    "abstract": "Mendel's Law of Dominance suggests that recessive disease expression requires the inheritance of two mutated alleles as the dominant, wildtype allele suppresses disease presentation leading to the expression of physiological normal phenotypes. However, there is existing evidence that challenges this school of thought. Here, we summarise existing literature evaluating metabolic and health impacts among carriers of autosomal recessive conditions, focusing on phenylketonuria (PKU), classical homocystinuria, galactosemia and Usher syndrome as examples. Our findings suggest that carriers, often described as 'unaffected', may actually display attenuated symptoms for the recessive disease they are carrying. For instance, PKU is an inborn error of metabolism characterised by the build-up of plasma phenylalanine attributed to the deficiency of the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) enzyme. While less severe, PKU carriers also exhibit this impaired enzymatic activity, leading to elevated plasma phenylalanine levels, especially after phenylalanine consumption. Related to these metabolic alterations in the PAH pathway, there is early evidence to suggest that PKU carriers may have compromised cognitive and mental health outcomes. Overall, research on the health and metabolic impacts of PKU carriers is sparse, with most studies conducted several decades ago. However, early evidence suggests that intermediate phenotypes among carriers of autosomal recessive conditions are plausible. The illustrated possible intermediate phenotypes observed among carriers necessitates future research to determine possible clinical implications among this population."

In a 14-day open-label dose-escalation study (Synpheny-1, NCT04534842 ), we test a primary endpoint of change from baseline in labeled Phe (D5-Phe AUC<sub>0-24</sub>; D5-Phe area under the curve (AUC) over 24 hours after D5-Phe administration) in plasma after D5-Phe challenge in adult participants with screening Phe of greater than 600 µM. Secondary endpoints were the change from baseline in fasting plasma Phe and the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events. A total of 20 participants (ten male and ten female) were enrolled and 15 completed the study treatment. Here, we show that both strains lower Phe levels in participants with PKU: D5-Phe AUC<sub>0-24</sub> was reduced by 43% from baseline with SYNB1934 and by 34% from baseline with SYNB1618. SYNB1934 led to a decrease in fasting plasma Phe of 40% (95% CI, -52, -24). There were no serious adverse events or infections. Four participants discontinued because of adverse events, and one withdrew during the baseline period. We show that synthetic biotics can metabolize Phe in the gut, lower post-prandial plasma Phe levels and lower fasting plasma Phe in patients with PKU."

Despite disease detection through newborn screening and introduction of MNT as early as birth, adherence to MNT often deteriorates from childhood onwards, complicating the assessment of its effectiveness in the long term. Via a modified Delphi process, consensus (≥70% agreement) was sought on 19 statements among an international, multidisciplinary 13-member expert panel. After three iterative voting rounds, the panel achieved consensus on 17 statements related to the limitations of the long-term effectiveness of MNT (7), the burden of long-term reliance on MNT (4), and its potential long-term detrimental health effects (6). According to the expert panel, the effectiveness of MNT is limited in the long term, is associated with a high treatment burden, and demonstrates that adults with PKU are often unable to achieve metabolic control through dietary management alone, creating an unmet need in the adult PKU population."

    "abstract": "In phenylketonuria (PKU), toxic phenylalanine (Phe) can harm other organs beyond the brain. Furthermore, the lifelong therapy of PKU consists of consumption of increased amounts of amino-acid mixture that provoke hyperfiltration in the glomeruli. Therefore, the adherence to therapy in PKU might influence the long-term kidney function in PKU patients. Data from 41 adult, early treated PKU patients were analyzed in this 10-year, retrospective, monocentric study. Two subgroups were created according to their therapy adherence: one with long-term blood Phe levels in the therapeutic range (&lt;600 µmol/L), and one with suboptimal blood Phe levels. Renal function and metabolic parameters were collected over 10 years. Kidney function parameters were compared between the two groups and associations between blood Phe levels and kidney function were tested. After 10 years, serum creatinine levels (p = 0.369) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (p = 0.723) did not change significantly from baseline in the good therapeutic group. The suboptimal therapeutic group's eGFR decreased in the same period (from 110.4 ± 14 mL/min/1.73 m2 to 94.2 ± 16 mL/min/1.73 m2, p = 0.017). At 10 years, the suboptimal therapeutic group had an increased serum creatinine level (81 ± 14.4 μmol/L vs. 71.5 ± 13 μmol/L, p = 0.038), and a decreased eGFR (94.2 ± 16 mL/min/1.73 m2 vs. 103.3 ± 13 mL/min/1.73 m2p = 0.031) compared to the good adhering group. Significant negative correlation between Phe levels and eGFR (r = -0.41, p = 0.008) was observed. Long-term suboptimal therapy adherence in PKU patients with high blood Phe levels may lead to deterioration in kidney function."

The aim of this study was to investigate the quality of life in adult patients with HFI in comparison to patients with dietary-treated, classical phenylketonuria (PKU). Patients with HFI and patients with classical PKU were recruited from the adult metabolic centers in The Netherlands and Belgium and via social media. Patients were asked to fill out the 36-item Short Form Health survey (SF-36) and a modified PKU Quality Of Life (PKU-QoL) questionnaire. Patients with HFI (n = 19) did not report any restrictions in their health-related quality of life, except for vitality and general mental health, which were scored more unfavorable compared to patients with PKU (n = 19) (p < 0.05, adjusted for level of education and country of origin). The results from the modified PKU-QoL demonstrated a statistically significantly greater impact of the disease in the social domain in HFI. A substantial proportion of both HFI and PKU patients (21%) reported a great to severe emotional impact of their disease. Finally, patients with HFI experienced statistically significantly less food temptations, less guilt if dietary restrictions not followed, and less overall difficulty following dietary restrictions. Although patients with HFI showed to have a generally good quality of life, they scored lower on vitality and general mental health, and reported a greater social impact of the disease. These aspects deserve further study and clinical attention."

Sub-punches of varying sizes (1.5-6 mm) can be taken from DBS specimens to use as inputs for a range of biochemical assays. Advances in DNA sequencing workflows allow whole-genome sequencing (WGS) libraries to be generated directly from inputs such as peripheral blood, saliva, and DBS. We compared WGS metrics obtained from libraries generated directly from DBS to those generated from DNA extracted from peripheral blood, the standard input for this type of assay. We explored the flexibility of DBS as an input for WGS by altering the punch number and size as inputs to the assay. We showed that WGS libraries can be successfully generated from a variety of DBS inputs, including a single 3 mm or 6 mm diameter punch, with equivalent data quality observed across a number of key metrics of importance in the detection of gene variants. We observed no difference in the performance of DBS and peripheral-blood-extracted DNA in the detection of likely pathogenic gene variants in samples taken from individuals with cystic fibrosis or phenylketonuria. WGS can be performed directly from DBS and is a powerful method for the rapid discovery of clinically relevant, disease-causing gene variants."

Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the data, and binary logistic regression was performed to determine factors affecting the health professionals' attitudes toward TOPFA, expressed as the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). The study found that 63.5% of health professionals approved of the birth of a fetus with cleft lip and palate, while 36.5% opposed it. Similarly, 39.7% approved of the birth of a fetus with phenylketonuria, while 60.3% opposed it.

The top three factors considered by health professionals when agreeing on TOPFA were \"the impact of fetal disease on fetal function and growth,\" \"the severity of fetal disease,\" and \"the assessment of indications for fetal disease by professionals and related professional advice.\" The majority of health professionals (75-78%) preferred joint decision-making by parents regarding the right to decide TOPFA. Our study indicates that the attitudes of health professionals toward TOPFA can differ significantly depending on the specific birth defect under consideration. Notably, the majority of health professionals prioritized \"the impact of fetal abnormalities on fetal function and development\" when deciding their support for TOPFA, advocating for the decision to be a joint one between the parents. Additionally, factors such as religious beliefs, professional training, age, and job title appeared to influence these attitudes toward TOPFA. Our findings could serve as a reference point in the development of guidelines for the prevention and management of birth defects."

    "title": "Health-related quality of life in a european sample of adults with early-treated classical PKU.",
    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a rare inborn error of metabolism affecting the catabolism of phenylalanine (Phe). To date, findings regarding health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in adults with early-treated classical PKU are discrepant. Moreover, little is known about metabolic, demographic, and cognitive factors associated with HRQoL. Hence, we aimed to investigate HRQoL and its association with demographic, metabolic, and cognitive characteristics in a large European sample of adults with early-treated classical PKU. This cross-sectional study included 124 adults with early-treated classical PKU from Hungary, Italy, Spain, Switzerland, and Turkey. All participants prospectively completed the PKU quality of life questionnaire (PKU-QoL), a questionnaire specifically designed to evaluate the impact of PKU and its treatment on HRQoL in individuals with PKU. In addition, information about Phe levels (concurrent and past year), demographic (age and sex), and cognitive variables (intelligence quotient, IQ) were collected. Most domains revealed little or no impact of PKU on HRQoL and more than three-quarters of the patients rated their health status as good, very good, or excellent. Nevertheless, some areas of concern for patients were identified. Patients were worried about the guilt that they experience if they do not adhere to the dietary protein restriction and they were most concerned about high Phe levels during pregnancy. Further, tiredness was the most affected symptom, and the supplements' taste was considered a main issue for individuals with PKU. The overall impact of PKU on HRQoL was higher in women (U = 1315.5, p = .012) and in adults with a lower IQ (r<sub>s</sub> = - 0.448, p = .005). The overall impact of dietary protein restriction was higher in adults with higher concurrent Phe levels (r<sub>s</sub> = 0.272, p = .007) and higher Phe levels during the past year (r<sub>s</sub> = 0.280, p = .009). The impact of PKU on most domains assessed in the PKU-QoL was considered to be low. These results likely reflect the successful implementation of the newborn screening resulting in the prevention of severe adverse long-term outcomes. However, a particular clinical focus should be given to patients with lower IQ, higher Phe levels, and women, as these variables were associated with a lower HRQoL."

    "title": "Newborn Screening for Neurodevelopmental Disorders May Exacerbate Health Disparities.",
    "abstract": "Newborn screening (NBS) began in the early 1960s with screening for phenylketonuria on blood collected on filter paper. The number of conditions included in NBS programs expanded significantly with the adoption of tandem mass spectrometry. The recommended uniform screening panel provides national guidance and has reduced state variability. Universality and uniformity have been supported to promote equity. Recently, a number of researchers have suggested expanding NBS to include genomic sequencing to identify all genetic disorders in newborns. This has been specifically suggested for genes that increase the risk for neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), with the presumption that early identification in the newborn period would reduce disabilities. We offer arguments to show that genomic sequencing of newborns for NDDs risks exacerbating disparities. First, the diagnosis of NDD requires clinical expertise, and both genetic and neurodevelopmental expertise are in short supply, leading to disparities in access to timely follow-up. Second, therapies for children with NDDs are insufficient to meet their needs. Increasing early identification for those at risk who may never manifest developmental delays could shift limited resources to those children whose parents are more poised to advocate, worsening disparities in access to services. Rather, we suggest an alternative: genomic sequencing of all children with diagnosed NDDs. This focused strategy would have the potential to target genomic sequencing at children who manifest NDDs across diverse populations which could better improve our understanding of contributory genes to NDDs."

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an inborn error of metabolism caused by deficiency of phenylalanine hydroxylase, resulting in high blood phenylalanine (Phe) concentrations with potential for impaired neurocognition. Pegvaliase, a pegylated recombinant phenylalanine ammonia lyase that metabolizes Phe, is approved for use in adults with PKU and high blood Phe despite prior management. In the Phase 3 PRISM studies conducted in the United States, pegvaliase induction/titration/maintenance dosing led to clinically meaningful and statistically significant blood Phe reductions versus placebo, with a manageable safety profile. Here we report the primary endpoint, change in blood Phe levels from baseline to Week 52, and 2-year interim efficacy and safety results (to Week 144; data cut-off March 31, 2022) of an ongoing, open-label study in a Japanese PKU population (JapicCTI-194,642). Participants were 12 adults with PKU from Japan aged 18-70 years with blood Phe levels >600 μmol/L. In Part 1, participants received subcutaneous 2.5 mg pegvaliase once weekly for 4 weeks (induction), followed by titration up to 20 mg/day, then dose adjustment to a maximum 40 mg/day to achieve blood Phe efficacy (≤360 μmol/L); this maintenance dose was continued to Week 52. In Part 2, participants continued pegvaliase with dose adjustments up to a maximum 60 mg/day for up to 168 weeks. Among 11 participants evaluable for efficacy, mean (standard deviation) blood Phe concentration decreased from 1025.9 (172.7) μmol/L at baseline to 448.3 (458.8) μmol/L at Week 52 (mean 57.5% decrease). Up to Week 104, all 11 (100%) efficacy-evaluable participants achieved blood Phe levels ≤600 μmol/L, 9 (81.8%) achieved ≤360 μmol/L, and 8 (72.7%) achieved ≤120 μmol/L. All 12 participants reported ≥1 adverse event (AE), most commonly injection site erythema and injection site swelling (n = 10, 83.3% each). The pegvaliase exposure-adjusted AE rate was 23.5 per person-years overall, 41.2 per person-years during induction/titration, and 13.5 per person-years during maintenance. All participants developed pegvaliase-induced antibody responses. There were no AEs leading to discontinuation, no deaths, and no anaphylaxis events. Although interim, these results support the use of pegvaliase in Japanese adults with PKU with elevated blood Phe levels and are consistent with results from the Phase 3 PRISM studies."

    "abstract": "Newborn screening (NBS) began a revolution in the management of biochemical genetic diseases, greatly increasing the number of patients for whom dietary therapy would be beneficial in preventing complications in phenylketonuria as well as in a few similar disorders. The advent of next generation sequencing and expansion of NBS have markedly increased the number of biochemical genetic diseases as well as the number of patients identified each year. With the avalanche of new and proposed therapies, a second wave of options for the treatment of biochemical genetic disorders has emerged. These therapies range from simple substrate reduction to enzyme replacement, and now ex vivo gene therapy with autologous cell transplantation. In some instances, it may be optimal to introduce nucleic acid therapy during the prenatal period to avoid fetopathy. However, as with any new therapy, complications may occur. It is important for physicians and other caregivers, along with ethicists, to determine what new therapies might be beneficial to the patient, and which therapies have to be avoided for those individuals who have less severe problems and for which standard treatments are available. The purpose of this review is to discuss the \"Standard\" treatment plans that have been in place for many years and to identify the newest and upcoming therapies, to assist the physician and other healthcare workers in making the right decisions regarding the initiation of both the \"Standard\" and new therapies. We have utilized several diseases to illustrate the applications of these different modalities and discussed for which disorders they may be suitable. The future is bright, but optimal care of the patient, including and especially the newborn infant, requires a deep knowledge of the disease process and careful consideration of the necessary treatment plan, not just based on the different genetic defects but also with regards to different variants within a gene itself."

    "abstract": "Introduction: the dietary intake of individuals with phenylketonuria (PKU) may vary widely according to different cultural eating habits, lifestyle, access to multidisciplinary team, and metabolic formulas available. Thus, knowing the dietary intake of this population makes it possible to tailor nutritional treatment strategies to impact their health. Objective: to analyze the evidence on the dietary intake of individuals with PKU. Methods: an integrative literature review was conducted on the dietary intake of individuals with PKU in the databases PUBMED, BIREME and Science Direct. Original articles that addressed the energy and macronutrient food intake of children, adolescents and/or adults with PKU were included in the study, without time restriction, in any language. A total of 384 articles were found and 27 articles were selected and analyzed. Results: evidence about the nutritional composition of their diet showed that individuals with PKU consume between 1160-2721 kcal of energy -7.2-17.4 % (32.4-76.9 g) of energy as protein, 45.9-69.2 % of energy as carbohydrates, 16.6-39 % of energy as lipids- and between 7.6 and 20 g of fiber. Conclusion: most individuals with PKU have low energy, protein and fiber intake, adequate lipid intake, and high carbohydrate intake. Metabolic control of the disease is still a challenge in all countries. Nutritional strategies to improve dietary nutritional composition and phenylalanine blood levels in individuals with PKU remain an urgent issue."

The goal is to explore the relationship between gene sequencing by NeoSeq combined with tandem mass spectrum (TMS) and four neonatal diseases. A total of 1,989 newborns from August 2010 to December 2021 were enrolled. The case number of congenital hypothyroidism, phenylketonuria, adrenocortical hyperplasia, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency was counted, and the results of gene sequencing by NeoSeq and TMS were analyzed. The proportion of male newborns was higher than that of female newborns (51.68% vs. 48.32%). The detection rate of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency was higher than that of the other three diseases (0.60% vs. 0.05%, 0.05%, 0.15%). A total of 121 newborns were recalled from 1989 newborns by traditional screening technique, and TMS detected phenylketonuria, citrullinemia, glutaric acidemia type I, and 3-methylcro-tonyl-CoA carboxylase deficiency in 1 newborn each. Gene sequencing by NeoSeq of newborns with positive TMS results confirmed the presence of susceptibility genes, and 17 of 1,868 newborns with normal biochemical tests had pathogenic genes. The incidence of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency is relatively higher in four neonatal diseases, and the detection rate of gene sequencing by NeoSeq combined with TMS is high."

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an autosomal recessive inborn error of metabolism resulting from a deficiency of phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH). If untreated by dietary restriction of phenylalanine intake, impaired postnatal cognitive development results from the neurotoxic effects of excessive phenylalanine (Phe). Signs and symptoms include severe intellectual disability and behavior problems with a high frequency of seizures and variable microcephaly. Maternal PKU syndrome refers to fetal damage resulting in congenital abnormalities when the mother has untreated PKU during pregnancy. Here, we report an intellectually normal 32-year-old female who presented with recurrent pregnancy loss and two neonatal deaths with congenital heart disease, microcephaly, intrauterine growth restriction, and respiratory distress. She was diagnosed with PKU through exome sequencing performed for carrier testing with a homozygous pathogenic variant in the PAH gene, c.169_171del, p.(Glu57del) that is associated with classical PKU. Consistent with the genetic finding, she had a markedly increased plasma phenylalanine concentration of 1642 μmol/L (normal <100). This case demonstrates that recurrent pregnancy loss due to untreated maternal PKU may present as an initial finding in otherwise unsuspected classical PKU and illustrates that extreme degrees of variable expressivity may occur in classical PKU. Moreover, this case illustrates the value of genomic sequencing of women who experience recurrent pregnancy loss or neonatal anomalies."

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an inherited metabolic disorder in which accumulation of phenylalanine (Phe) leads to poor neurological outcomes without treatment. Dietary therapy is the main treatment and nonadherence is associated with elevated blood Phe levels and correspondingly poor neuropsychiatric outcomes. This study aimed to examine the effect of home visits on blood Phe levels in PKU patients. Sixty-five paediatric PKU patients who were on low-phenylalanine diet were visited monthly at home for 6 months. At each visit, dietary education was provided, patients' height and weight were measured and blood samples were collected. Twenty-eight (43.1%) patients had classic PKU and 37 (56.9%) had moderate PKU. Blood Phe levels decreased statistically significant at first, second, fifth, and sixth months compared with screening visit. Blood Phe levels in moderate PKU patients decreased significantly at the last visit unlike classic PKU patients. A significant decrease in blood Phe levels was observed in patients older than 10 years. Anthropometric parameters improved. Dietary nonadherence is the main treatment failure in PKU. Home visits for education are a promising way to improve treatment outcomes by providing quality education, better assessment, and correction of mistakes but they should be ongoing and supported by different interventions that address patients' special needs."

    "abstract": "Hepatocyte transplantation for genetic liver diseases has several potential advantages over gene therapy. However, low efficiency of cell engraftment has limited its clinical implementation. This problem could be overcome by selectively expanding transplanted donor cells until they replace enough of the liver mass to achieve therapeutic benefit. We previously described a gene therapy method to selectively expand hepatocytes deficient in cytochrome p450 reductase (Cypor) using acetaminophen (APAP). Because Cypor is required for the transformation of APAP to a hepatotoxic metabolite, Cypor deficient cells are protected from toxicity and are able to expand following APAP-induced liver injury. Here, we apply this selection system to correct a mouse model of phenylketonuria (PKU) by cell transplantation. Hepatocytes from a wildtype donor animal were edited in vitro to create Cypor deficiency and then transplanted into PKU animals. Following selection with APAP, blood phenylalanine concentrations were fully normalized and remained stable following APAP withdrawal. Cypor-deficient hepatocytes expanded from <1% to ~14% in corrected animals, and they showed no abnormalities in blood chemistries, liver histology, or drug metabolism. We conclude that APAP-mediated selection of transplanted hepatocytes is a potential therapeutic for PKU with long-term efficacy and a favorable safety profile."

To date, there have been no systematic studies of HRQoL in people with UCDs. We reviewed HRQoL and clinical data for 190 children and 203 adults enrolled in a multicenter UCD natural history study. Physical and psychosocial HRQoL in people with UCDs were compared to HRQoL in healthy people and people with phenylketonuria (PKU) and diabetes mellitus. We assessed relationships between HRQoL, UCD diagnosis, and disease severity. Finally, we calculated sample sizes required to detect changes in these HRQoL measures. Individuals with UCDs demonstrated worse physical and psychosocial HRQoL than their healthy peers and peers with PKU and diabetes. In children, HRQoL scores did not differ by diagnosis or severity. In adults, individuals with decreased severity had worse psychosocial HRQoL. Finally, we show that a large number of individuals would be required in clinical trials to detect differences in HRQoL in UCDs. Individuals with UCDs have worse HRQoL compared to healthy individuals and those with PKU and diabetes. Future work should focus on the impact of liver transplantation and other clinical variables on HRQoL in UCDs."

    "abstract": "The main neurological, cognitive, and behavioural consequences of phenylketonuria have been eradicated thanks to new-born screening and Phe-restricted diet therapy. However, the effects of high phenylalanine levels during adolescence and adulthood on neurocognitive functions remain a concern. This systematic review aimed at collecting clinical data suggesting the safest metabolic target for early treated PKU during the second decade of life. Twenty studies met the inclusion criteria for full-text review. Relevant studies included papers that (a) examined the relationship between metabolic control and neurocognitive functions during adolescence or (b) investigated the impact of metabolic control in adolescence on adult outcomes. Most studies showed a positive correlation between metabolic control during adolescence and neurocognitive outcomes across ages. This was true both for IQ and executive functions, although data on executive functions were less clear, and it remains to be established whether they are more vulnerable to Phe than IQ. Taken together present evidence confirm brain vulnerability to Phe during adolescence and suggests that low average Phe levels and low Phe fluctuations should be maintained throughout life. While results are fully compatible with current European recommendations, clinical and methodological limitations coupled with remarkable interindividual variability prevented a clear identification of a safe threshold for Phe blood levels during adolescence."

The brain MRI scans of patients with late diagnosed PKU were evalu- ated retrospectively. Patients' age at diagnosis, age at which diet started, age at MRI, and, blood phenylalanine (Phe) levels at the time point closest to the MRI were recorded. Eleven patients aged from 3 to 28 years were included in the study. The median MRI involvement score was 17 (interquartile range = 3). The most involved white matter areas were the parietooccipital areas. There was a significant (P = .046) correlation between the blood Phe level at the timepoint closest to the imaging and the MRI involvement score. Our study provides insights into the MRI findings and scoring system in PKU patients. We have developed a scoring system based on the widely used Loes and modified Loes scoring systems that can be implemented in clinical practice.

    "abstract": "Aspartame is the methyl-ester of the aspartate-phenylalanine dipeptide. Over time, it has become a very popular artificial sweetener. However, since its approval by the main food safety agencies, several concerns have been raised related to neuropsychiatric effects and neurotoxicity due to its ability to activate glutamate receptors, as well as carcinogenic risks due to the increased production of reactive oxygen species. Within this review, we critically evaluate reports concerning the safety of aspartame. Some studies evidenced subtle mood and behavioral changes upon daily high-dose intake below the admitted limit. Epidemiology studies also evidenced associations between daily aspartame intake and a higher predisposition for malignant diseases, like non-Hodgkin lymphomas and multiple myelomas, particularly in males, but an association by chance still could not be excluded. While the debate over the carcinogenic risk of aspartame is ongoing, it is clear that its use may pose some dangers in peculiar cases, such as patients with seizures or other neurological diseases; it should be totally forbidden for patients with phenylketonuria, and reduced doses or complete avoidance are advisable during pregnancy. It would be also highly desirable for every product containing aspartame to clearly indicate on the label the exact amount of the substance and some risk warnings."

We designed a spreadsheet to calculate the amounts of SF-AA and HM required to cover amino acid, protein, and energy needs in patients with the nine main IEM-AA-P in infants aged under 6 months. Upon entering the infant's weight and the essential amino acid or intact protein requirements for the specific IEM, the spreadsheet calculates the corresponding required volume of HM based on the amino acid concentration in HM. Next, the theoretical daily fluid intake (typical range, 120-200 mL/kg/day) is entered, and the estimated daily fluid intake is calculated. The required daily volume of SF-AA is calculated as the difference between the total fluid intake value and the calculated volume of HM. The spreadsheet allows for the introduction of a range of requirements based on the patient's metabolic status, and includes the option to calculate the required volume of expressed HM, which may be necessary in certain conditions such as MMA/PA and UCD. In cases in which breastfeeding on demand is feasible, the spreadsheet determines the daily amount of SF-AA divided over 6-8 feeds, assuming that SF-AA is administered first, followed by HM as needed. Intake data calculated by the spreadsheet should be evaluated in conjunction with data from clinical and nutritional analyses, which provide a comprehensive understanding of the patient's nutritional status and help guide individualized dietary management for the specific IEM."

    "title": "Phenylalanine Tolerance over Time in Phenylketonuria: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.",
    "abstract": "In phenylketonuria (PKU), natural protein tolerance is defined as the maximum natural protein intake maintaining a blood phenylalanine (Phe) concentration within a target therapeutic range. Tolerance is affected by several factors, and it may differ throughout a person's lifespan. Data on lifelong Phe/natural protein tolerance are limited and mostly reported in studies with low subject numbers. This systematic review aimed to investigate how Phe/natural protein tolerance changes from birth to adulthood in well-controlled patients with PKU on a Phe-restricted diet. Five electronic databases were searched for articles published until July 2020. From a total of 1334 results, 37 articles met the eligibility criteria (<i>n</i> = 2464 patients), and 18 were included in the meta-analysis. The mean Phe (mg/day) and natural protein (g/day) intake gradually increased from birth until 6 y (at the age of 6 months, the mean Phe intake was 267 mg/day, and natural protein intake was 5.4 g/day; at the age of 5 y, the mean Phe intake was 377 mg/day, and the natural protein intake was 8.9 g/day). However, an increase in Phe/natural protein tolerance was more apparent at the beginning of late childhood and was >1.5-fold that of the Phe tolerance in early childhood. During the pubertal growth spurt, the mean natural protein/Phe tolerance was approximately three times higher than in the first year of life, reaching a mean Phe intake of 709 mg/day and a mean natural protein intake of 18 g/day. Post adolescence, a pooled analysis could only be performed for natural protein intake. The mean natural protein tolerance reached its highest (32.4 g/day) point at the age of 17 y and remained consistent (31.6 g/day) in adulthood, but limited data were available. The results of the meta-analysis showed that Phe/natural protein tolerance (expressed as mg or g per day) increases with age, particularly at the beginning of puberty, and reaches its highest level at the end of adolescence. This needs to be interpreted with caution as limited data were available in adult patients. There was also a high degree of heterogeneity between studies due to differences in sample size, the severity of PKU, and target therapeutic levels for blood Phe control."

Despite success preventing central nervous system damage, there is increasing evidence of possible other unfavorable outcomes affecting other systems, e.g. kidney and bone; underlying mechanisms are yet to be fully elucidated. This observational, cross-sectional and descriptive study investigated 20 adult with PKU evaluating biochemical parameters, BMD measurements and extrapolating data from 3-days food records and protein substitutes (PS) and special low protein foods (SLPF) composition. Blood gas venous analysis (VBG) indices were indicative of metabolic acidosis in 60% of PKU patients and VBG pH significantly correlated with BMD's <i>Z</i>-score (<i>p</i>-value = 0.022) even if its overall mean was in range (-1.29). Low bone mineral density for chronological age (<i>Z</i>-score < - 2.0) was found in 4 patients (20%). Indices of kidney function were not impaired. All used PS had a moderate excess of acidity, while SLPF were alkalizing and type/variety of consumed vegetables did not determine significant changes in acid-base equilibrium. Total intakes of potassium and magnesium were lower than expected. PKU patients seem to be at risk of metabolic acidosis, directly linked to possible low bone mineralization. This may be related to the acidic composition of PS, potentially capable of acidifying the entire diet. Reported low intakes of potassium and magnesium may be relevant to these observations. Further studies are needed to better address these topics."

    "abstract": "Pathophysiology of osteopenia in phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) deficient phenylketonuria (PKU) is poorly characterized. The Pah<sup>enu2</sup> mouse is universally osteopenic where dietary phenylalanine (Phe) management with amino acid defined chow does not improve bone density.

This investigation demonstrates complexity of Pah<sup>enu2</sup> SSC energy dysregulation. Creatine use by bone tissue is recognized. <i>In vitro</i> Pah<sup>enu2</sup> SSCs in osteoblast differentiation respond to creatine with increased <i>in situ</i> alkaline phosphatase activity and increased intracellular ATP content. Animal studies applied a 60-day creatine regimen to Pah<sup>enu2</sup> and control cohorts.

Experimental cohorts (Phe unrestricted Pah<sup>enu2</sup>, Phe restricted Pah<sup>enu2</sup>) were provided 1% creatine <i>ad libitum</i> in water.

In Phe unrestricted Pah<sup>enu2</sup>, creatine was without effect as bone density remained equivalent to Pah<sup>enu2</sup> control cohorts. Alternatively, Phe-restricted Pah<sup>enu2</sup> receiving creatine present increased bone density. We hypothesize small molecule dysregulation in untreated Pah<sup>enu2</sup> disallows creatine utilization; therefore, osteopenia persisted. Dietary Phe restriction enables creatine utilization to enhance SSC osteoblast differentiation and improve <i>in vivo</i> bone density. PKU intervention singularly focused on Phe reduction enables residual disease including osteopenia and neurologic elements. Intervention concurrently addressing Phe homeostasis and energy dysregulation will improve disease elements refractory to standard of care Phe reduction mono-therapy."

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an inherited disorder of protein metabolism. It is generally treated using dietary management with limited intake of phenylalanine (Phe). Partial breastfeeding (BF) is encouraged among mothers of infants with PKU, together with a Phe-free mixture of synthetic amino acids. Our aim was to describe our current BF rates and complementary feeding practices, as well as examining parental experiences of infant feeding. The objective was to better understand the challenges faced by families so that improvements can be made to clinical care. A chart review was carried out on 39 PKU patients, examining the BF rate and duration, use of second stage synthetic protein (SP), and average complementary feeding age. A parental questionnaire on complementary feeding and BF experience was designed: 26% of babies were partially breastfed at three months of age; 70% of mums would like to have breastfed for longer and cited PKU as a reason for stopping; 52% of parents reported challenges during the complementary feeding process including food refusal, protein calculation, and anxiety around maintaining good Phe levels. Suggestions to improve BF continuation and duration include active promotion of the benefits and suitability, access to lactation consultant, and peer support. The delay in introducing a second stage SP may contribute to long-term bottle use for SP. Improved patient education, written resources, and support is necessary to improve food choices and long-term acceptance of SP."

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a rare inherited metabolic disease characterized by phenylalanine hydroxylase enzyme deficiency. In PKU patients, coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) levels were found low. Therefore, we focused on the modification of CoQ10 to load the micelles and increase entry of micelles into the cell and mitochondria, and it is taking a part in ATP turnover. Micelles had produced by comparing two different production methods (thin-film layer and direct-dissolution), and characterization studies were performed (zeta potential, size, and encapsulation efficiency). Then, L-arginine (LARG) and poly-arginine (PARG) were incorporated with the micelles for subsequential release and PKU cell studies. The effects of these components on intracellular uptake and their use in the cellular cycle were analyzed by ELISA, Western blot, membrane potential measurement, and flow cytometry methods. In addition, both effects of LARG and PARG micelles on pharmacokinetics at the cellular level and their cell binding rate were determined. The thin-film method was found superior in micelle preparation. PARG/LARG-modified micelles showed sustained release. In the cellular and mitochondrial uptake of CoQ10, CoQ10-micelle + PARG > CoQ10-micelle + LARG > CoQ10-micelle > CoQ10 was found. This increased localization caused lowering of oxygen consumption rates, but maintaining mitochondrial membrane potential. The study results had showed that besides micelle formulation, PARG and LARG are effective in cellular and mitochondrial targeting."

    "abstract": "Phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency (PAHD) is an autosomal recessive disorder affecting phenylalanine (Phe) metabolism caused by mutations in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (<i>PAH</i>) gene. It has a complex phenotype with many variants and genotypes in various populations. This study sets out to analyze the screening results of children with phenylketonuria (PKU) in Yinchuan City and characterize the mutation variants of the <i>PAH</i> gene. Phenylketonuria screening results were retrospectively analyzed in 398,605 neonates (207,361 males and 191,244 females) born in different maternity hospitals in Yinchuan City between January 2017 and December 2021. Screening for genetic metabolic diseases was performed with parental consent at their own expense. A comprehensive diagnosis was performed by integrating tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) findings with clinical presentations. High-throughput sequencing (HTS) was used to detect genetic and metabolic disease-associated genes in children with PKU who were clinically diagnosed and voluntarily tested. The identified loci were validated through Sanger sequencing and parental verification. Among the screened newborns, 45 (11.3/100,000) PKU cases were diagnosed. In the 38 cases that underwent self-financed <i>PAH</i> sequencing, 56 mutations were detected in 76 chromosomes, with an overall detection rate of 73.7%. All patients harbored mutant genes, and the 56 mutations detected identified represented 14 variants, including 8 missense mutations, 2 splicing mutations, 2 nonsense mutations, and 2 silent mutations. The mutations were primarily distributed in <i>exons 2</i>, <i>3</i>, <i>6</i>, <i>7</i>, <i>9</i>, <i>11</i>, and <i>intron 4</i>, with the highest frequency observed in <i>exon 7</i> (25 [44.7%]), followed by <i>exon 11</i> (15 [26.7%]). The most prevalent mutations were <i>exon 7</i>-p.R252W (10 [17.9%]) and <i>exon 7</i>-p.R261Q (8 [14.3%]). The <i>PAH</i> gene mutations in children with PKU in Yinchuan City are predominantly concentrated in <i>exons 6</i>, <i>7</i>, and <i>11</i>, with the highest detection rates observed for p.R252W and p.R261Q mutations."

    "abstract": "Neonatal screening and early treatment have changed the natural history of PKU, preventing severe neurological and intellectual disability. Nevertheless, the outcome of the disease in early-treated adult patients (ETPKU) is less than optimal, the predictive value of metabolic biomarkers is feeble, and the recommended levels of blood phenylalanine (Phe) for adulthood are controversial. A crucial question whose answer will improve our understanding and treatment of PKU is whether cognitive outcomes can be modulated by levels of Phe even in early-treated adults. To address this question, we carried out an interventional study in seven ETPKU women planning a pregnancy. They underwent an extensive neurocognitive assessment at baseline, and 3 and 6 months after having attained the blood Phe concentration recommended to prevent PKU fetopathy, but before pregnancy. After 3 and 6 months with a stable blood Phe level of about 240 μmol/L, all participants experienced significant improvements in almost all neurocognitive domains and tasks. IQ also increased of 11 to 21 points from the last assessment before enrolment. This pattern remained strong and consistent after correction for multiple comparisons. Our results indicate that a) strong cognitive improvement is possible even in adulthood and may be demonstrated by lowering Phe near normal levels; b) testing cognition under different metabolic conditions may unveil an individual vulnerability to Phe. These results pave the way for personalised treatment of the disease in adults with ETPKU."

The study was a prospective observational,involving 104 pediatric volunteers between 2019 and 2020.Two groups were formed:the PKU patient group and the healthy control group.These two groups were further divided into three subgroups:obese,overweight,and normal weight.The patients' anthropometric measurements,body fat analysis,biochemical analysis, GI and glycemic load(GL),arterial stiffness measurements,and echocardiographic findings were recorded. The PKU patient group's glucose,total cholesterol,LDL,and HDL values were significantly lower than the healthy control group(p = 0.010 for glucose and p = 0.001 for total cholesterol,LDL and HDL).Triglyceride levels were higher in the PKU patient group than in the healthy controls(109.6 vs. 76.7 mg/dl,p = 0.001).

A child with RCM in conjunct with PKU who was admitted to the Children's Hospital Affiliated to Zhengzhou University in June 2020 due to edema of eyelids and lower limbs for 1 year and aggravation for over 1 month was selected as the study subject. Relevant clinical data were collected. Peripheral blood samples of the child and his parents were collected for whole exome sequencing (WES). Candidate variants were validated by Sanger sequencing and bioinformatic analysis. Childhood, TNNI3 gene and restricted cardiomyopathy were used as the keywords to search the Wanfang data knowledge service platform, Chinese Journal Full-text database and PubMed database, and the search period was limited to from the time of establishment till August 2022. Clinical manifestations and characteristics of the TNNI3 gene variants were summarized. The child, a 2-year-old-and-4-month-old male, had normal intelligence, facial features and normal hair and skin color, but his motor and physical development was delayed, in addition with edema of bilateral eyelids and lower limbs. The results of WES and Sanger sequencing revealed that he has harbored compound heterozygous variants of the PAH gene, namely c.331C>T (p.R111X) and c.940C>A (p.P341T), which were inherited from his father and mother, respectively. In addition, he has also harbored a de novo heterozygous variant of c.508C>T (p.R170W) of the TNNI3 gene. Based on the guidelines from the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG), the TNNI3: c.508C>T (p.R170W) was classified as a pathogenic variant (PS2+PS4+PM2_Supporting+PM5), PAH: c.331C>T (p.R111X) as a pathogenic variant (PVS1+PM2_Supporting+PM3+PP4), and c.940C>A (p.P341T) as a likely pathogenic variant (PM2_Supporting+PM3+PM5+PP4). In total 30 children with RCM caused by TNNI3 gene variants were retrieved, with a male-to-female ratio of 1 : 1.55 and manifestations including heart failure, sinus rhythm, bi-atrial enlargement, ST-T wave change, ventricular restricted filling, and decreased ventricular diastolic function. In total 16 variants of the TNNI3 gene were identified, among which c.575G>A was the most common, and all cases had conformed to an autosomal dominant inheritance. Phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency and RCM are rare diseases with complex clinical manifestations. The PAH: c.331C>T (p.R111X)/c.940C>A (p.P341T) and TNNI3: c.508C>T (p.R170W) variants probably underlay the RCM and PKU in this child."

    "abstract": "This study introduces a sustainable approach to simultaneously produce pectin and phenolic compounds from pistachio industrial waste and applies them in the formulation of low-phenylalanine cookies. The co-optimization process was performed using the microwave-assisted technique and a Box-Behnken design, considering four variables and two responses: pectin yield and total phenolic content (TPC). The co-optimized condition (microwave power of 700 W, irradiation time of 210 s, pH level of 1.02, and LSR of 20 mL/g) resulted in a pectin yield of 15.85 % and a TPC of 10.12 %. The pectin obtained under co-optimized condition was evaluated for its physicochemical, structural, and thermal properties and the phenolic extract for its antiradical activity. Characterization of the pectin sample revealed a high degree of esterification (44.21 %) and a galacturonic acid-rich composition (69.55 %). The average molecular weight of the pectin was determined to be 640.236 kDa. FTIR and <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectroscopies confirmed the structure of pectin, with an amorphous nature and high thermal stability observed through XRD and DSC analysis. Additionally, the extract exhibited significant antiradical activity comparable to butylated hydroxyanisole and ascorbic acid. The isolated ingredients were used to formulate low-protein, low-phenylalanine cookies for phenylketonuria patients. The addition of 0.5 % pectin and 1 mL/g extract led to increased moisture content (from 9.05 to 12.89 %) and specific volume (from 7.28 to 9.90 mL/g), decreased hardness (from 19.44 to 10.39 N × 10<sup>2</sup>), and improved antioxidant properties (from 5.15 % to 44.60 % inhibition) of the cookies. Importantly, there was no significant increase observed in the phenylalanine content of the samples with pectin and extract addition. Furthermore, sensory evaluation scores demonstrated significantly higher scores for taste, odor, texture, and overall acceptability in cookies enriched with 0.5 % pectin and 1 mL/g extract, with scores of 4.53, 3.93, 4.40, and 4.60, respectively."

In Iran, several studies have been performed to investigate the genetics bases of the PKU in different parts of the country. In this study, we have analysed and present an update of the mutational landscape of the PAH gene as well as the population genetics and frequencies of detected variants for each cohort. Published articles on PKU mutations in Iran were identified through a comprehensive PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science (ISI), SCOPUS, Elsevier, Wiley Online Library and SID literature search using the terms: \"phenylketonuria\", \"hyperphenylalaninemia\", and \"PKU\" in combination with \"Iran\", \"Iranian population\", \"mutation analysis\", and \"Molecular genetics\". Among the literature-related to genetics of PKU, 18 studies were on the PKU mutations. According to these studies, in different populations of Iran 1497 patients were included for mutation detection that resulted in detection of 129 different mutations. Results of genetic analysis of the different cohorts of Iranian PKU patients show that the most prevalent mutation in Iran is the pathogenic splice variant c.1066-11G > A, occurring in 19.54% of alleles in the cohort. Four other common mutations were p.Arg261Gln, p.Pro281Leu, c.168 + 5G > C and p.Arg243Ter (8.18%, 6.45%, 5.88% and 3.7%, respectively). One notable feature of the studied populations is its high rate of consanguineous marriages. Considering this feature, determining the prevalent PKU mutations could be advantageous for designing screening and diagnostic panels in Iran."

    "abstract": "Despite early diagnosis and compliance with phenylalanine (Phe)-restricted diets, many individuals with phenylketonuria (PKU) still exhibit neurological changes and experience deficits in working memory and other executive functions. Suboptimal choline intake may contribute to these impairments, but this relationship has not been previously investigated in PKU. The objective of this study was to determine if choline intake is correlated with working memory performance, and if this relationship is modified by diagnosis and metabolic control. This was a cross-sectional study that included 40 adults with PKU and 40 demographically matched healthy adults. Web-based neurocognitive tests were used to assess working memory performance and 3-day dietary records were collected to evaluate nutrient intake. Recent and historical blood Phe concentrations were collected as measures of metabolic control. Working memory performance was 0.32 z-scores (95% CI 0.06, 0.58) lower, on average, in participants with PKU compared to participants without PKU, and this difference was not modified by total choline intake (F[1,75] = 0.85, p = 0.36). However, in a subgroup with complete historical blood Phe data, increased total choline intake was related to improved working memory outcomes among participants with well controlled PKU (Phe = 360 µmol/L) after adjusting for intellectual ability and mid-childhood Phe concentrations (average change in working memory per 100 mg change in choline = 0.11; 95% CI 0.02, 0.20; p = 0.02). There also was a trend, albeit nonsignificant (p = 0.10), for this association to be attenuated with increased Phe concentrations. Clinical monitoring of choline intake is essential for all individuals with PKU but may have important implications for working memory functioning among patients with good metabolic control. Results from this study should be confirmed in a larger controlled trial in people living with PKU."

    "abstract": "Amyloids were conventionally referred to as extracellular and intracellular accumulation of Aβ42 peptide, which causes the formation of plaques and neurofibrillary tangles inside the brain leading to the pathogenesis in Alzheimer's disease. Subsequently, amyloid-like deposition was found in the etiology of prion diseases, Parkinson's disease, type II diabetes, and cancer, which was attributed to the aggregation of prion protein, α-Synuclein, islet amyloid polypeptide protein, and p53 protein, respectively. Hence, traditionally amyloids were considered aggregates formed exclusively by proteins or peptides. However, since the last decade, it has been discovered that other metabolites, like single amino acids, nucleobases, lipids, glucose derivatives, etc., have a propensity to form amyloid-like toxic assemblies. Several studies suggest direct implications of these metabolite assemblies in the patho-physiology of various inborn errors of metabolisms like phenylketonuria, tyrosinemia, cystinuria, and Gaucher's disease, to name a few. In this review, we present a comprehensive literature overview that suggests amyloid-like structure formation as a common phenomenon for disease progression and pathogenesis in multiple syndromes. The review is devoted to providing readers with a broad knowledge of the structure, mode of formation, propagation, and transmission of different extracellular amyloids and their implications in the pathogenesis of diseases. We strongly believe a review on this topic is urgently required to create awareness about the understanding of the fundamental molecular mechanism behind the origin of diseases from an amyloid perspective and possibly look for a common therapeutic strategy for the treatment of these maladies by designing generic amyloid inhibitors."

    "title": "Professional activity, gender and disease-related emotions: The impact on parents' experiences in caring for children with phenylketonuria.",
    "abstract": "Clinical management of rare diseases often fails to acknowledge the challenges faced by caregivers. Whilst management of phenylketonuria (PKU) may not be considered as dire as other conditions, most studies primarily concentrate on clinical issues, dietary adherence, or the quality of life of the PKU patients, leaving caregivers in the background. The aim of the study was to evaluate the psychosocial effects of PKU on family caregivers. Between October 30th, 2022 and February 28th, 2023, we collected data from caregivers of children with PKU using an anonymous, self-administered, computer-assisted online questionnaire. The survey was distributed among to patients during their regular visits to five Polish PKU treatment centers. A total of 159 Polish caregivers of children with PKU completed the survey. This research shows that while women caregivers were more likely to be unemployed due to their responsibilities for childcare (50.3% compared to 0% for men), and men caregivers were more likely to be employed full-time (93.8% compared to 40.6% for women), the former reported higher emotional engagement in caregiving (88.1% vs 56.3% respectively). Significantly, unemployed mothers reported higher levels of loneliness, helplessness, and emotional control problems, and lacked psychological/emotional support more often than employed mothers. This research also shows a statistically significant positive correlation between mothers' education level and financial situation (<i>p</i> < 0.05) and education level and professional activity (<i>p</i> < 0.01). Additionally, a significant positive correlation was found between perceived financial situation and feeling of happiness (<i>p</i> < 0.001), and between financial situation and professional activity (p < 0.001). Finally, a significant positive correlation was observed between feeling of happiness and professional activity (<i>p</i> < 0.05). According to our findings, there is a link between subjective happiness, financial situation, and professional activity among female caregivers. The relationship between these factors goes beyond just the income earned from work. The results of our study imply that there could even be a therapeutic advantage for working mothers. It is crucial to recognize the emotional difficulties that employed mothers may experience while taking care of a child with PKU, and to provide them with the necessary assistance and resources to meet their needs. Additionally, our results may provide a foundation for redefining the support system for caregivers in Poland."

    "title": "Phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency treatment and management: A systematic evidence review of the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG).",
    "abstract": "Elevated serum phenylalanine (Phe) levels due to biallelic pathogenic variants in phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) may cause neurodevelopmental disorders or birth defects from maternal phenylketonuria. New Phe reduction treatments have been approved in the last decade, but uncertainty on the optimal lifespan goal Phe levels for patients with PAH deficiency remains. We searched Medline and Embase for evidence of treatment concerning PAH deficiency up to September 28, 2021. Risk of bias was evaluated based on study design. Random-effects meta-analyses were performed to compare IQ, gestational outcomes, and offspring outcomes based on Phe ≤ 360 μmol/L vs > 360 μmol/L and reported as odds ratio and 95% CI. Remaining results were narratively synthesized. A total of 350 studies were included. Risk of bias was moderate. Lower Phe was consistently associated with better outcomes. Achieving Phe ≤ 360 μmol/L before conception substantially lowered the risk of negative effect to offspring in pregnant individuals (odds ratio = 0.07, 95% CI = 0.04-0.14; P < .0001). Adverse events due to pharmacologic treatment were common, but medication reduced Phe levels, enabling dietary liberalization. Reduction of Phe levels to ≤360 μmol/L through diet or medication represents effective interventions to treat PAH deficiency."

    "abstract": "In phenylketonuria (PKU), a previous intervention study assessing the patients ability to tolerate fruits and vegetables containing phenylalanine 76-100 mg/100 g without limit or measurement, found that an extra 50 mg/day phenylalanine, but not 100 mg/day, was tolerated from these fruits and vegetables. In a further 6-month extension study, we examined the effect of the 'free' use of this group of fruits and vegetables on blood phenylalanine control. For 6 months, the patients ate fruits and vegetables containing phenylalanine 76-100 mg/100 g without limit or measurement. Three-day diet diaries and the patients' weights were collected monthly. Blood phenylalanine spots were collected weekly aiming for blood phenylalanine levels <360 μmol/L. Retrospective blood phenylalanine was collected 6 months pre-trial. All 16 patients (69% females) from the intervention study took part in the extension study. Most of the patients (<i>n</i> = 14/16) had classical PKU with a median age of 10.5 years (range: 6-13). There was no statistically significant difference in the median blood phenylalanine pre-study (270, range: 50-760 μmol/L) compared to the 6-month extension study (250, range: 20-750 μmol/L) (<i>p</i>= 0.4867). The patients had a median of 21 and 22 bloodspots, pre- and post-trial, respectively. In the extension study, the patients had an actual mean intake of 11 g/day (4-37) natural protein and 65 g/day (60-80) protein equivalent from a protein substitute. The mean phenylalanine intake was 563 mg/day (200-1850) with only 19 mg/day (0-146) phenylalanine from fruits and vegetables containing phenylalanine 76-100 mg/100 g. The weight z-scores remained unchanged (1.52 vs. 1.60, <i>p</i> = 0.4715). There was no adverse impact on blood phenylalanine control when fruits and vegetables containing phenylalanine 76-100 mg/100 g were eaten without limit or measurement. However, the fruits and vegetable portion sizes eaten were small (60 g/week). Further longitudinal work is necessary to examine the 'free' use of fruits and vegetables containing phenylalanine 76-100 mg/100 g on metabolic control in patients with PKU."

    "abstract": "There are concerns about muscle and bone health in patients with Phenylketonuria (PKU). Our aim was to compare muscle mass, function, and bone health among young adults with PKU who maintained or suspended dietary treatment. Three groups were considered-PKU-1: 10 patients who used a protein substitute (PS) without phenylalanine (Phe); PKU-2: 14 patients who used the PS without Phe until eighteen years old and then practiced mostly a vegan diet; and 24 matched healthy controls. A 24 h recall survey, blood parameters, body composition and bone mineral density through DEXA, rectus femoris thickness by ultrasound, hand grip strength, submaximal exercise test, and walking speed were assessed. PKU-1 patients had lower hand grip strength than their matched controls, but no other differences. Compared to controls, the PKU-2 group had lower fat-free mass (<i>p</i> = 0.01), less spine and femoral bone mineral density (<i>p</i> = 0.04 and <i>p</i> < 0.01, respectively), and peak workload on the incremental test (<i>p</i> = 0.03). When comparing PKU groups, blood Phe levels were significantly lower in the PKU-1 group (<i>p</i> = 0.02). Among PKU patients, abandoning the dietary treatment and maintaining high blood Phe concentrations could be deleterious for muscles and bones. However, we cannot discard other causes of bone and muscle damage in these patients."

    "title": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) Urinary Metabolomic Phenotype Is Defined by Genotype and Metabolite Imbalance: Results in 51 Early Treated Patients Using Ex Vivo <sup>1</sup>H-NMR Analysis.",
    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a rare metabolic disorder caused by mutations in the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene. Depending on the severity of the genetic mutation, medical treatment, and patient dietary management, elevated phenylalanine (Phe) may occur in blood and brain tissues. Research has recently shown that high Phe not only impacts the central nervous system, but also other organ systems (e.g., heart and microbiome). This study used ex vivo proton nuclear magnetic resonance (<sup>1</sup>H-NMR) analysis of urine samples from PKU patients (mean 14.9 ± 9.2 years, <i>n</i> = 51) to identify the impact of elevated blood Phe and PKU treatment on metabolic profiles. Our results found that 24 out of 98 urinary metabolites showed a significant difference (<i>p</i> < 0.05) for PKU patients compared to age-matched healthy controls (<i>n</i> = 51) based on an analysis of urinary metabolome. These altered urinary metabolites were related to Phe metabolism, dysbiosis, creatine synthesis or intake, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, end products of nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide degradation, and metabolites associated with a low Phe diet. There was an excellent correlation between the metabolome and genotype of PKU patients and healthy controls of 96.7% in a confusion matrix model. Metabolomic investigations may contribute to a better understanding of PKU pathophysiology."

    "abstract": "Patients with phenylketonuria (PKU) exhibit a high incidence of obesity. Currently, bariatric surgery remains the most effective long-term treatment for obese patients. However, limited data regarding the applicability of bariatric surgery to obese patients with PKU have been reported in the literature. A case involving a young woman, in whom sleeve gastrectomy was performed to manage obesity that was resistant to conservative therapy, is presented herein. The present report is the first to describe sleeve gastrectomy in an obese patient with PKU. The surgery proceeded without complications. Furthermore, the patient's phenylalanine levels remained under control for the first 3 months after surgery, with no major neurological complications. The diet prescribed in the first few months after surgery is complex; nevertheless, it is feasible to follow if supervised by a dietary team specialised in rare metabolic diseases. Bariatric surgery in this patient with PKU did not result in any major complications. Surgery is feasible but it is important for the dietetic team involved to have expertise in PKU management."

    "abstract": "Measuring resting energy expenditure (REE) in individuals living with phenylketonuria (PKU) using indirect calorimetry (IC) is unusual in healthcare facilities because it requires specific protocols and expensive equipment. Considering that determining REE is crucial for devising nutritional strategies for the management of PKU, the aim of this study was to identify the predictive equations that provide the best estimates of REE in children and adolescents living with PKU and to propose a predictive equation for determining REE in this population. An REE concordance study was conducted with children and adolescents living with PKU. Anthropometric and body composition assessments using bioimpedance and REE assessment using IC were performed. The results were compared to 29 predictive equations. Fifty-four children and adolescents were evaluated. The REE obtained using IC differed from all estimated REE, except Henry's equation for male children (p = 0.058). Only this equation showed good agreement (0.900) with IC. Eight variables were associated with the REE obtained using IC with emphasis on fat-free mass (kg) (r = 0.786), weight (r = 0.775), height (r = 0.759) and blood phenylalanine (r = 0.503). With these variables, three REE equations were suggested, with R<sup>2</sup> = 0.660, 0.635 and 0.618, respectively, and the third equation, which involves weight and height, showed adequate sample size for a statistical power of 0.942. Most equations, not specific for individuals living with PKU, overestimate the REE of this population. We propose a predictive equation for assessing REE for children and adolescents living with PKU to be used in settings where IC is not available."

    "title": "Genomic newborn screening: Are we entering a new era of screening?",
    "abstract": "Population newborn screening (NBS) for phenylketonuria began in the United States in 1963. In the 1990s electrospray ionization mass spectrometry permitted an array of pathognomonic metabolites to be identified simultaneously, enabling up to 60 disorders to be recognized with a single test. In response, differing approaches to the assessment of the harms and benefits of screening have resulted in variable screening panels worldwide. Thirty years on and another screening revolution has emerged with the potential for first line genomic testing extending the range of screening conditions recognized after birth to many hundreds. At the annual SSIEM conference in 2022 in Freiburg, Germany, an interactive plenary discussion on genomic screening strategies and their challenges and opportunities was conducted. The Genomics England Research project proposes the use of Whole Genome Sequencing to offer extended NBS to 100 000 babies for defined conditions with a clear benefit for the child. The European Organization for Rare Diseases seeks to include \"actionable\" conditions considering also other types of benefits. Hopkins Van Mil, a private UK research institute, determined the views of citizens and revealed as a precondition that families are provided with adequate information, qualified support, and that autonomy and data are protected. From an ethical standpoint, the benefits ascribed to screening and early treatment need to be considered in relation to asymptomatic, phenotypically mild or late-onset presentations, where presymptomatic treatment may not be required. The different perspectives and arguments demonstrate the unique burden of responsibility on those proposing new and far-reaching developments in NBS programs and the need to carefully consider both harms and benefits."

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) or hyperphenylalaninemia is considered a paradigm for an inherited (metabolic) liver defect and is, based on murine models that replicate all human pathology, an exemplar model for experimental studies on liver gene therapy. Variants in the PAH gene that lead to hyperphenylalaninemia are never fatal (although devastating if untreated), newborn screening has been available for two generations, and dietary treatment has been considered for a long time as therapeutic and satisfactory. However, significant shortcomings of contemporary dietary treatment of PKU remain. A long list of various gene therapeutic experimental approaches using the classical model for human PKU, the homozygous enu2/2 mouse, witnesses the value of this model to develop treatment for a genetic liver defect. The list of experiments for proof of principle includes recombinant viral (AdV, AAV, and LV) and non-viral (naked DNA or LNP-mRNA) vector delivery methods, combined with gene addition, genome, gene or base editing, and gene insertion or replacement. In addition, a list of current and planned clinical trials for PKU gene therapy is included. This review summarizes, compares, and evaluates the various approaches for the sake of scientific understanding and efficacy testing that may eventually pave the way for safe and efficient human application."

The hypothesis of executive function impairment is prominent in accounting for the neuropsychological phenotype in phenylketonuria (PKU) and is suspected in moderate hyperphenylalaninemia (MHP). However, the issue of early onset of executive disorders remains. The aim of this study was to explore the hypothesis of early executive dysfunction in HPA patients and the possible links with certain metabolic variables according to the new international classifications for patients with PKU and MHP. A group of 23 HPA children (12 PKU, 11 MHP) aged 3 to 5 years was included and compared to 50 control children. The two groups were comparable in terms of socio-demographics (age, sex, parental education level). Executive functions were assessed using performance-based tests and daily life questionnaires (parents and teachers). Preschool HPA patients have comparable executive scores to control subjects. In contrast, PKU patients score significantly worse than MHP patients on 3 executive tests (verbal working memory, visual working memory and cognitive inhibition. There is no executive complaints in daily life (parents and teachers) for the 2 groups of patients. In addition, 3 correlations were identified between executive scores and Phe levels at inclusion, mean Phe level and variability of Phe levels throughout life. Thus, there appears to be evidence of early executive dysfunction in PKU preschool-children, but not in MHP children. Occasionally, certain metabolic indicators can predict executive difficulties in young children with PKU."

    "abstract": "Phenylalanine (PHE) is an essential amino acid. Dietary PHE converts to tyrosine by phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) activity. Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an autosomal-recessive disorder resulting from PAH enzyme deficiency. Elevations of PHE in plasma are classified based on the degree of enzyme deficiency into classic PKU (PHE≥1200 μmol/l), mild PKU (PHE>600 μmol/l and <1200 μmol/l), and non-PKU-hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA) or mild hyperphenylalaninemia (MHP) (PHE≤600 μmol/l). This is a single-center study of consecutive patients managed at the Pediatric Neurology Department and the outpatient clinic at Children's Welfare Teaching Hospital, Medical City, Baghdad, Iraq, from the 1st of October 2019 to the 1st of October 2020. Five patients were selected who were proven to have non-PKU-HPA (PHE<600 µmol/L) conﬁrmed by the high-performance liquid chromatography analysis and assured to have sapropterin response by the sapropterin loading test which showed >30% decrease in PHE level. All patients presented with a neurological complaint, they were between three months and 15 years, and they were treated with sapropterin, Levodopa (L-Dopa), and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT). The study included the demographic and clinical profile, biochemical response to sapropterin, and clinical response to treatment according to the development quotient. The five patients enrolled in this study had a gross motor developmental delay as their main symptom. One case also had a seizure and dystonia, another had a fluctuation of symptoms, four had a consanguineous marriage, and two had a family history of the same condition. Moreover, all cases had a higher than 30% decrease in PHE level by the tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) loading test, and all of them showed significant clinical improvements after treatment except for one that showed only a moderate improvement. The BH4 therapy significantly enhanced dietary PHE tolerance and permitted a PHE-free medical formula to be discontinued in all patients with PHE within an achieved therapeutic target (120-300 μM]. MHP is not a mild disease as it may be related to neurotransmitter disorders. Sapropterin, L-DOPA, and 5-HT are always used for patients suspected of having neurotransmitter diseases, particularly those with MHP."

    "title": "Oral Microbiome Traits of Type 1 Diabetes and Phenylketonuria Patients in Latvia.",
    "abstract": "Some metabolic disorder treatments require patients to follow a specific diet or to consume supplements that, over time, can lead to oral microbiome alterations. Well-known disorders requiring such treatment are phenylketonuria (PKU), an inborn error of amino acid metabolism, and type 1 diabetes (T1D), a metabolic disorder that requires a specific diet regimen. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the oral health and microbiome characteristics that might contribute to caries activity and periodontal disease risk in PKU and T1D patients. In this cross-sectional study, 45 PKU patients, 24 T1D patients, and 61 healthy individuals between the ages of 12 and 53 years were examined. Their anamnestic data and dental status were assessed by one dentist. Microbial communities were detected from saliva-isolated DNA using <i>16S rRNA</i> gene V3-V4 sequencing on Illumina MiSeq sequencing platform. Results revealed that the PKU patient group displayed the highest number of extracted teeth (on average 1.34), carious teeth (on average 4.95), and carious activity (44.44% of individuals) compared to the T1D and CTRL groups. The lowest numbers of filled teeth (on average 5.33) and extracted teeth (on average 0.63) per individual were observed in T1D patients. Gingivitis appeared more often in the T1D group; however, possible risk of periodontal disease was seen in both the T1D and PKU patient groups. The highest number of differentially abundant genera was detected in the PKU group (<i>n</i> = 20), with enrichment of <i>Actinomyces</i> (<i>p</i><sub>adj</sub> = 4.17 × 10<sup>-22</sup>), <i>Capnocytophaga</i> (<i>p</i><sub>adj</sub> = 8.53 × 10<sup>-8</sup>), and <i>Porphyromonas</i> (<i>p</i><sub>adj</sub> = 1.18 × 10<sup>-5</sup>) compared to the CTRL group. In conclusion, the dental and periodontal health of PKU patients was found to be significantly inferior compared to T1D patients and healthy controls. T1D patients showed early signs of periodontal disease. Several genera that correlate with periodontal disease development were found in both groups, thus suggesting that T1D and PKU patients should seek early and regular dental advice and be educated about proper oral hygiene practices."

    "title": "Nutrient Status among Latvian Children with Phenylketonuria.",
    "abstract": "(1) Introduction: Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an autosomal recessive inborn error of phenylalanine metabolism. The main treatment for PKU is to manage nutrition, thereby restricting phenylalanine intake. Part of patient management is analyzing eating habits to substitute missing nutrients and limit the overdose of nutrients. This is mainly done by analyzing food diaries. This is the first review of Latvian PKU patients eating habits performed by analyzing 72-h food diaries (FD). (2) Materials and Methods: This study included individuals between the ages of 18 and 31 years, PKU patients and 31 age- and sex-matched control groups. All respondents kept 72-h food diaries (FD) and underwent testing for zinc, selenium and ferritin levels in the blood. Food diary data were analyzed by Nutritics software to calculate the theoretical intake of nutrients, and these values were compared with the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Latvia's recommended values. (3) Results: A lack of motivation and diet therapy compliance in PKU patients was observed during this research. A total of 32% of PKU patients refused to fill out their FD or filled it out incorrectly. The analysis of nutrient intake was observed, and there was a statistically significant difference between PKU patients in the 1-3 age group and the control group in fat intake. Fat intake in PKU patients was below MRHL recommendations. The intake of iron was found to be surplus in all PKU patients in the age group of 1-3, 91% of PKU patients in the age group of 4-6 years, 63% in the age group of 7-12 and 71% in the 13-18 year age group. Although there were no instances in the PKU patients nor the control group who had ferritin levels above the normal range. Selenium intake was surplus in 80% of PKU patients in the 1-3 age group, 91% in PKU patients in the 4-6 age group, 88% in the 7-12 age group and 86% in the 13-18 age group. None of the patients had Se levels in the blood above the normal range. Zn intake was surplus in 100% of PKU patients in the 1-3 age group, 82% in PKU patients in the 4-6 age group, 88% in the 7-12 age group and 57% in the 13-18 age group, and no PKU patients had high Zn levels. None of the control group participants had levels below the normal range of Zn and Se while 11% of PKU patients in the 13-18 age group had inadequate levels of Se, although Se intake based on their FD was optimal. (4) Conclusions: Regular PKU patient nutritional status evaluation is important to define and prevent possible nutrient deficiency, and further investigation should be continued to find out the mechanism of nutrient absorption in PKU patients. To prevent macronutrient deficiency such as fat and micronutrient deficiency in PKU patients, one could use supplements or try an improved nutrient content of Phe-free formula in the future."

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an autosomal recessive inborn error of metabolism where high phenylalanine (Phe) concentrations cause irreversible intellectual disability that can be prevented by newborn screening and early treatment. Evidence suggests that PKU subjects not adherent to treatment could be at risk of insulin resistance (IR). We studied how Phe concentrations (PheCs) relate to IR using machine learning (ML) and derived potential biomarkers. In our cross-sectional study, we analyzed subjects with neonatal diagnoses of PKU, grouped as follows: 10 subjects who adhered to treatment (G1); 14 subjects who suspended treatment (G2); and 24 control subjects (G3). We analyzed plasma biochemical variables, as well as profiles of amino acids and acylcarnitines in dried blood spots (DBSs). Higher PheCs and plasma insulin levels were observed in the G2 group compared to the other groups. Additionally, a positive correlation between the PheCs and homeostatic measurement assessments (HOMA-IRs) was found, as well as a negative correlation between the HOMA-Sensitivity (%) and quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI) scores. An ML model was then trained to predict abnormal HOMA-IRs using the panel of metabolites measured from DBSs. Notably, ranking the features' importance placed PheCs as the second most important feature after BMI for predicting abnormal HOMA-IRs. Our results indicate that low adherence to PKU treatment could affect insulin signaling, decrease glucose utilization, and lead to IR."

    "abstract": "Phenylalanine (Phe)-free protein substitutes are used within the management of phenylketonuria (PKU). However, adherence to the Phe-restricted diet is often challenging. A child (age 4.5 years) with PKU rejected the Phe-free protein substitutes used within her therapeutic diet, causing stress for herself and family at mealtimes. Switching to a new Phe-free protein substitute that can be mixed into other foods [PKU GOLIKE<sup>®</sup> (3-16)] provided an alternative strategy that was acceptable to the child. Good control of blood Phe was maintained. Newer Phe-free protein substitutes may provide a strategy for maintaining the therapeutic diet for PKU where the patient has difficulty doing so on standard substitutes. Here, the use of a Phe-free protein substitute with improved palatability and ease of use supported maintenance of the Phe-restricted diet for a child with PKU who struggled to maintain the diet on standard substitutes."

    "abstract": "Management of patients with phenylketonuria mainly includes limiting the content of phenylalanine in the diet. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate oral problems in children with phenylketonuria compared to the healthy population as a case-control study. The subjects of the case and control groups were selected according to the inclusion criteria. First, the oral cavity and tooth were examined by a specialist dentist to indicate the decayed, missing due to caries, and filled teeth index in both groups. To inves- tigate the level of phenylalanine and evaluate other laboratory examinations, 2 mL of blood and saliva samples was taken from the subjects. Blood and saliva phenylalanine levels were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. Phosphorus, calcium, and pH levels were investigated through calorimetric measurement. The data were analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences software. There was no significant difference between the case and control groups in terms of age and sex. The average level of calcium and phosphorus in the case group was higher than in the control group. Also, the average decayed, missing due to caries, and filled teeth index in the case group was not significantly different compared to the control group. None of the above-investigated indicators had a significant relationship with each other. On the other hand, it was found that there was a positive and significant relationship between phenylalanine in blood, saliva, and pH as well as between saliva phenylalanine with decayed, missing due to caries, and filled teeth. The results of this study indicate a significant effect of phenylketonuria disease on calcium, phosphorus, and oral pH levels in children."

    "title": "Nutrition management of PKU with pegvaliase therapy: update of the web-based PKU nutrition management guideline recommendations.",
    "abstract": "The web-based GMDI/SERN PKU Nutrition Management Guideline, published before approval of pegvaliase pharmacotherapy, offers guidance for nutrition management of individuals with phenylketonuria (PKU) treated with dietary therapy and/or sapropterin. An update of this guideline aims to provide recommendations that improve clinical outcomes and promote consistency and best practice in the nutrition management of individuals with PKU receiving pegvaliase therapy. Methodology includes: formulation of a research question; review, critical appraisal, and abstraction of peer-reviewed studies and unpublished practice literature; expert input through Delphi surveys and a Nominal Group process; and external review by metabolic experts. Recommendations, summary statements, and strength of evidence are included for each of the following topics: (1) initiating a pegvaliase response trial, (2) monitoring therapy response and nutritional status, (3) managing pegvaliase treatment after response to therapy, (4) education and support for optimal nutrition with pegvaliase therapy, and (5) pegvaliase therapy during pregnancy, lactation, and adolescence. Findings, supported by evidence and consensus, provide guidance for nutrition management of individuals receiving pegvaliase therapy for PKU. Recommendations focus on nutrition management by clinicians, as well as the challenges for individuals with PKU as a result of therapy changes. Successful pegvaliase therapy allows the possibility for individuals with PKU to consume an unrestricted diet while still maintaining the benefits of blood phenylalanine control. This necessitates a perspective change in education and support provided to individuals in order to achieve healthy nutrient intake that supports optimal nutritional status. The updated guideline, and companion Toolkit for practical implementation of recommendations, is web-based, allowing for utilization by health care providers, researchers, and collaborators who advocate and care for individuals with PKU. These guidelines are meant to be followed always taking into account the provider's clinical judgement and considering the individual's specific circumstances. Open access is available at the Genetic Metabolic Dietitians International ( https://GMDI.org ) and Southeast Regional Genetics Network ( https://managementguidelines.net ) websites."

    "abstract": "To build therapeutic strains, Escherichia coli Nissle (EcN) have been engineered to express antibiotics, toxin-degrading enzymes, immunoregulators, and anti-cancer chemotherapies. For efficacy, the recombinant genes need to be highly expressed, but this imposes a burden on the cell, and plasmids are difficult to maintain in the body. To address these problems, we have developed landing pads in the EcN genome and genetic circuits to control therapeutic gene expression. These tools were applied to EcN SYNB1618, undergoing clinical trials as a phenylketonuria treatment. The pathway for converting phenylalanine to trans-cinnamic acid was moved to a landing pad under the control of a circuit that keeps the pathway off during storage. The resulting strain (EcN SYN8784) achieved higher activity than EcN SYNB1618, reaching levels near when the pathway is carried on a plasmid. This work demonstrates a simple system for engineering EcN that aids quantitative strain design for therapeutics."

Concordance study with adults with PKU and a comparison group (CG) with healthy adults. Anthropometric and body composition assessments and REE assessment by indirect calorimetry (IC) were performed. The results obtained by IC were compared with predictive equations. Sixty-nine adults were evaluated (PKU: 36; CG: 33). The REE of adults with mild and classic PKU is similar (p>.05) and similar to CG (p>.05). The REE of individuals with early diagnosis is higher (p < .05) than the REE of individuals with late diagnosis. The REE obtained by IC differed (p < .05) from all estimated REE. Late diagnosis of PKU showed lower REE compared to individuals with early diagnosis. The REE of adults with PKU does not differ in relation to the type of PKU, nor does it differ from the CG. Predictive equations overestimate REE."

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an inborn error of metabolism caused by deficient activity of phenylalanine hydroxylase. In Brazil, the National Neonatal Screening Program enables early treatment of patients with PKU, which prevents them from developing severe neurological damage and mental disabilities. However, between 20 and 30% of early-treated patients with PKU present focal cognitive deficits, including deficits in working memory, processing speed, and psychiatric symptoms such as anxiety, depression, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Therefore, age-specific neuropsychiatric and cognitive tests are important components of PKU patient care. To date, there are no officially approved guidelines or recommendations of tools in Portuguese validated for use in Brazil that could be applied to assess these parameters in patients with PKU. To recommend tools validated for use in Brazil that can be used in daily clinical practice to assess quality of life and neuropsychological outcomes in patients with PKU. Six Brazilian experts discussed about eligible tools based on their clinical experience, the feasibility of their use in clinical routines, and their availability in public health services. Before the meeting, an independent review of the literature was conducted to identify the currently validated tools in Brazil, using the MEDLINE and SciELO databases. The experts recommended nine tools to assess quality of life (Peds-QL, SF-36 or WHOQOL-bref), executive function (BRIEF or Bayley-III), IQ (SONR 2½-7[a] or WASI) and ADHD (MTA-SNAP-IV and ASRS). These instruments may be easily incorporated into clinical practice and improve the quality of multidisciplinary care of patients with PKU."

    "abstract": "This study aimed at evaluating the health status and healthcare consumption of ≥16-year-old patients with phenylketonuria (PKU), with a focus on early-diagnosed patients. This retrospective observational study used health insurance claims data from the French SNDS (Système National des Données de Santé) database. Patients with PKU were identified between 2006 and 2018 by ICD-10 diagnosis codes E70.0 (classic PKU) or E70.1 (other causes of hyperphenylalaninemia). They were matched to controls by age, sex, and region. Patients with early-diagnosed PKU were defined as patients born after implementation of nationwide newborn screening in France in 1972. Outcomes were analyzed for the year 2018. Overall, 3549 patients with PKU were identified on January 1st, 2018. Of those, 3469 patients could be matched to 17,170 controls without PKU. Of these patients, 2175 were at least 16 years old and suffered significantly more than controls from specific comorbidities of interest - osteoporosis (28.7% vs 19.8%, p < 0.0001), hypertension (20.9% vs 17.0%, p < 0.0001), hypercholesterolemia (12.8% vs 8.3%, p < 0.0001), diabetes (7.8% vs 4.7%, p < 0.0001), obesity (4.2% vs 1.3%, p < 0.0001), ischemic heart diseases (4.8% vs 2.0%, p < 0.0001), and depression (10.3% vs 8.2%, p = 0.0011). Prescriptions for many medications were also more frequent in patients with PKU than controls. Among ≥16-year-old patients, 1528 were categorized as early-diagnosed. Osteoporosis (0.3% vs 0.01%, p = 0.0035), chronic renal failure (0.6% vs 0.1%, p = 0.0020), hypertension (4.0% vs 2.7%, p = 0.0063), and obesity (2.5% vs 0.8%, p < 0.0001) were significantly more prevalent in early-diagnosed adult patients compared with matched controls. In total, 28.6% of ≥16-year-old patients with PKU and 40.4% of early-diagnosed patients with PKU received dietary amino-acid supplements. Sapropterin was prescribed to 5.0% and 7.0% patients, respectively. The results indicate that PKU is associated with a significantly higher comorbidity risk along with increased pharmaceutical prescriptions in adulthood. The comorbidity burden is less distinct in early-diagnosed patients but still present. Few patients are treated specifically for PKU in adulthood. Healthcare of patients with PKU should include prevention and management of comorbidities and especially target PKU-specific treatment adherence and consistent care in specialized medical centers in adulthood."

    "abstract": "The causes of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) remain unknown. Gene-searching efforts are well underway, but the identification of environmental risk factors is at least as important and should be a priority because some of them may be amenable to prevention or early intervention strategies. Genetically informative studies, particularly those employing the discordant monozygotic (MZ) twin design, are ideally suited to study environmental risk factors. This protocol paper describes the study rationale, aims, and methods of OCDTWIN, an open cohort of MZ twin pairs who are discordant for the diagnosis of OCD. OCDTWIN has two broad aims. In Aim 1, we are recruiting MZ twin pairs from across Sweden, conducting thorough clinical assessments, and building a biobank of biological specimens, including blood, saliva, urine, stool, hair, nails, and multimodal brain imaging. A wealth of early life exposures (e.g., perinatal variables, health-related information, psychosocial stressors) are available through linkage with the nationwide registers and the Swedish Twin Registry. Blood spots stored in the Swedish phenylketonuria (PKU) biobank will be available to extract DNA, proteins, and metabolites, providing an invaluable source of biomaterial taken at birth. In Aim 2, we will perform within-pair comparisons of discordant MZ twins, which will allow us to isolate unique environmental risk factors that are in the causal pathway to OCD, while strictly controlling for genetic and early shared environmental influences. To date (May 2023), 43 pairs of twins (21 discordant for OCD) have been recruited. OCDTWIN hopes to generate unique insights into environmental risk factors that are in the causal pathway to OCD, some of which have the potential of being actionable targets."

    "abstract": "The prognosis of phenylketonuria (PKU) is related to the quality of metabolic control all life-long. PKU treatment is based on a low-Phe diet, 6R-tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) treatment for the BH4-responsive PKU patients or enzyme replacement therapy. Fluctuations in blood phenylalanine (Phe) concentrations may be an important determinant of intellectual outcome in patients with early and continuously treated phenylketonuria (PKU). The aim of this work is to study the fluctuation of Blood Phe in patients treated by BH4 from birth in comparison with patients treated by low-Phe diet. We conducted a retrospective study in a national reference center for PKU management. We compared mean phenylalanine blood concentration and its fluctuation in 10 BH4-responder patients (BH4R) and in 10 BH4 non-responder patients (BH4NR) treated from birth. The mean blood Phe concentration is similar between the two groups before 10 years of age (290 ± 135 (BH4R) vs. 329 ± 187 µmol/L, p = 0.066 (BH4NR)) while it is lower in the BH4R group after 10 years of age. (209 ± 69 vs. 579 ± 136 µmol/L, p = 0.0008). Blood Phe fluctuation is significantly lower in the BH4R group compared to the BH4NR group (70.2 ± 75.6 vs. 104.4 ± 111.6 µmol/L, p < 0.01) before 6 years of age. There are no significant differences observed on nutritional status, growth, and neuropsychological tests between the two groups. BH4 introduced in the neonatal period is associated with less blood Phe fluctuation before 6 years. Additional time and patients are required to determine if the decrease in Phe fluctuation would positively impact the long-term outcome of PKU patients."

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU), an autosomal recessive disorder caused by pathogenic variants in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene, results in the accumulation of blood phenylalanine (Phe) to neurotoxic levels. Current dietary and medical treatments are chronic and reduce, rather than normalize, blood Phe levels. Among the most frequently occurring PAH variants in PKU patients is the P281L (c.842C>T) variant. Using a CRISPR prime-edited hepatocyte cell line and a humanized PKU mouse model, we demonstrate efficient in vitro and in vivo correction of the P281L variant with adenine base editing. With the delivery of ABE8.8 mRNA and either of two guide RNAs in vivo using lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) in humanized PKU mice, we observe complete and durable normalization of blood Phe levels within 48 h of treatment, resulting from corrective PAH editing in the liver. These studies nominate a drug candidate for further development as a definitive treatment for a subset of PKU patients."

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a rare genetic metabolic disorder in which especially high phenylalanine (Phe) concentrations cause brain dysfunction. If untreated, this brain dysfunction results in severe microcephaly, intellectual disability, and behavioral problems. Dietary restriction of Phe is the mainstay of PKU treatment, with long-term successful outcomes. Aspartame, an artificial sweetener sometimes added into medications, is metabolized in the gut into Phe. Then, patients suffering from PKU on a Phe-restricted diet should avoid consumption of aspartame. The aim of our study was to evaluate the number of drugs containing aspartame and/or Phe as an excipient, and to quantify their corresponding Phe intake. The list of drugs marketed in France containing aspartame and/or Phe was established using a national medication database called \"Theriaque\". For each drug, the corresponding daily Phe intake was calculated according to age and weight and was distributed into 3 categories: high (> 40 mg/d), medium (10 to 40 mg/d) and low (< 10 mg/d) Phe intake. The number of drugs containing Phe or its precursor aspartame remained very limited (n = 401). Among the aspartame containing drugs, Phe intakes were significant (medium or high) for only half of them whereas there were negligible for the others. Furthermore, these medications with a significant Phe intake were limited to few pharmaceutical classes (mainly antiinfectives agents, analgesics, and drugs for nervous system), and within these classes the drugs were limited to a small number of molecules, including principally amoxicillin, amoxicillin + clavulanic acid and paracetamol/ acetaminophen. In situations requiring the use of these molecules, we propose as an alternative, the use of an aspartame-free form of these molecules or a form with a low Phe intake. If it is not possible, we propose as second-line the use of another antibiotics or analgesics. Finally, we have to remember the benefits-risk balance to use medications containing significant Phe intake in PKU patients. Indeed, it may be better to use a Phe containing medication in the absence of an aspartame-free form of this drug rather than to leave a person with PKU without treatment."

To date, only 43 patients have been reported. Here, we report four patients from a single family with DNAJC12 deficiency while being followed up with a diagnosis of HPA. Two of the patients, who were cousins, were diagnosed with HPA by newborn screening. And the other two patients were siblings of these patients. Neurological examinations were normal except for one patient with mild learning disability. A c.158-2A>T p.(?) biallelic pathogenic variant was detected in intron 2 of the <i>DNAJC12</i> gene. In the 24 h tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) challenge test, there was a significant decrease in phenylalanine levels, especially at the 16th hour. Three patients had decreased homovalinic acid (HVA) and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5HIAA) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), while only one had decreased 5HIAA. In treatment, sapropterin, levodopa/carbidopa and 5-OH tryptophan were started. We propose that it will be beneficial to evaluate the patients who have unexplained hyperphenylalaninemia for DNAJC12 deficiency. Patients with early diagnosis of neurotransmitter deficiency may be given a chance to be treated before clinical symptoms begin."

It is crucial for health care workers to understand the situation of parents of a child with PKU and their needs. The purpose of this study was to explore the life story of parents with a child with PKU. This qualitative study has been done with a conventional content analysis approach. Twenty-four parents were selected purposefully. A semi-structured interview was conducted. Data analysis identified three main themes, which included parental reactions, consequences of a child with PKU in parents, and parents' needs. Parents of children with PKU can be considered people at risk for mental health because of their feelings of isolation and their lonely struggle to manage the disease and its effects on their child. This study shows that mothers need more support due to the misconceptions in and attitudes of their social environment. Therefore, it is necessary to understand this group, their needs and lives, and provide further support and promote empathy in the health system for the parents."

    "abstract": "Despite increasing knowledge about the effects of phenylketonuria on brain structure and function, it is uncertain whether white matter microstructure is affected and if it is linked to patients' metabolic control or cognitive performance. Thus, we quantitatively assessed white matter characteristics in adults with phenylketonuria and assessed their relationship to concurrent brain and blood phenylalanine levels, historical metabolic control and cognitive performance. Diffusion tensor imaging and <sup>1</sup>H spectroscopy were performed in 30 adults with early-treated classical phenylketonuria (median age 35.5 years) and 54 healthy controls (median age 29.3 years). Fractional anisotropy and mean, axial and radial diffusivity were investigated using tract-based spatial statistics, and white matter lesion load was evaluated. Brain phenylalanine levels were measured with <sup>1</sup>H spectroscopy whereas concurrent plasma phenylalanine levels were assessed after an overnight fast. Retrospective phenylalanine levels were collected to estimate historical metabolic control, and a neuropsychological evaluation assessed the performance in executive functions, attention and processing speed. Widespread reductions in mean diffusivity, axial diffusivity and fractional anisotropy occurred in patients compared to controls. Mean diffusivity and axial diffusivity were decreased in several white matter tracts and were most restricted in the optic radiation (effect size <i>r</i><sub>rb</sub> = 0.66 to 0.78, <i>P</i> < 0.001) and posterior corona radiata (<i>r</i><sub>rb</sub> = 0.83 to 0.90, <i>P</i> < 0.001). Lower fractional anisotropy was found in the optic radiation and posterior corona radiata (<i>r</i><sub>rb</sub> = 0.43 to 0.49, <i>P</i> < 0.001). White matter microstructure in patients was significantly associated with cognition. Specifically, inhibition was related to axial diffusivity in the external capsule (<i>r</i><sub>s</sub> = -0.69, <i>P</i> < 0.001) and the superior (<i>r</i><sub>s</sub> = -0.58, <i>P</i> < 0.001) and inferior longitudinal fasciculi (<i>r</i><sub>s</sub> = -0.60, <i>P</i> < 0.001). Cognitive flexibility was associated with mean diffusivity of the posterior limb of the internal capsule (<i>r</i><sub>s</sub> = -0.62, <i>P</i> < 0.001), and divided attention correlated with fractional anisotropy of the external capsule (<i>r</i><sub>s</sub> = -0.61, <i>P</i> < 0.001). Neither concurrent nor historical metabolic control was significantly associated with white matter microstructure. White matter lesions were present in 29 out of 30 patients (96.7%), most often in the parietal and occipital lobes. However, total white matter lesion load scores were unrelated to patients' cognitive performance and metabolic control. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that white matter alterations in early-treated phenylketonuria persist into adulthood, are most prominent in the posterior white matter and are likely to be driven by axonal damage. Furthermore, diffusion tensor imaging metrics in adults with phenylketonuria were related to performance in attention and executive functions."

Our study was designed to characterize the spectrum of variants in the <i>PAH</i> gene in Saudi patients. <b><i>Materials and Methods:</i></b> We screened a cohort of 72 Saudi patients with clinical and biochemical diagnoses of hyperphenylalaninemia at the largest tertiary care center in Saudi Arabia; the King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center (KFSH&RC), Riyadh. All patient's charts were reviewed under an approved study by Institutional Review Board. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Twenty-one different <i>PAH</i> variants were identified among the 144 PAH alleles assessed by targeted gene sequencing. Within the studied cohort, 60 of 72 patients had homozygous mutations with the the remaining 12 being compound heterozygotes. The most prevalent of the disease alleles identified in this study was the p.(Arg252Trp) mutation, which accounted for 38 of 144 alleles (26.4%). With the high incidence of genetic disorders in the population, religiously permissible preventive reproductive measures are a priority in our practice. Prenatal diagnoses carried out on four fetuses revealed two that were homozygous for PAH pathogenic variants. In addition, pre-implantation genetic diagnoses were initiated for 19 families. Eight of these families completed more than one full cycle of treatment, from which one healthy newborn was delivered. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> This study describes the spectrum of <i>PAH</i> variants in the Saudi population and highlights the molecular heterogeneity underlying phenylketonuria and hyperphenylalaninemia. These results add to the existing knowledge about <i>PAH</i> variants in Middle Eastern Countries. These results can be further translated to provide: informed counseling; cascade carrier testing in extended family members; and pre-marital screening."

    "abstract": "A low amino acid (AA)/protein diet is the principal treatment for many inherited amino acid disorders (IMDs). Due to their low AA content, plant foods constitute an essential part of diet therapy. However, data on their AA composition are limited, which leads to an estimation of AA intake from protein content rather than an accurate calculation of true AA intake. This study describes the AA content of a total of 73 plant foods (fruits, <i>n</i> = 12; vegetables, <i>n</i> = 51; and other plant foods, <i>n</i> = 10), with the analysis commissioned by the UK National Society for Phenylketonuria (NSPKU) over 15 years. For all fruits and some vegetables (e.g., rocket, watercress and pea shoots), raw samples were used during analysis. All other vegetables were cooked prior to analysis to represent the usual condition of the food at the time of serving. AA analysis was performed with ion exchange chromatography. The median percentage of protein was 2.0% [0.6-5.4%] for the fruits and vegetables analysed (<i>n</i> = 56), although higher in vegetables than in fruits. Each of the five reported AAs (leucine, lysine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, and methionine) supplied 1-5% per g of protein content. From the heterogeneous range of plant foods analysed, the AA/protein ratios differed significantly (2-5% in fruits and 1-9% in vegetables). There was a strong correlation between the amounts of each of the five AAs in the plant foods, but only a small, moderate correlation between the protein and AA content. Overall, this study provides data on the AA content of several plant foods, which are suitable for patients treated with a low AA/protein diet, including many novel plant options. However, only a limited range of fruits and vegetables were analysed due to the high costs of analysis. Hence, more extensive studies with an increased number of plant foods prepared by different cooking methods and replicate samples are necessary, particularly to examine the relationship between the protein and AA content in depth."

In addition, we explore the rationale for selecting beneficial microbial strains and aligning diets to accommodate their propagation in the gut. A pilot clinical trial design is presented to examine the effects of probiotics and exercise in patients with phenylketonuria (PKU); it is the most common inborn error of amino acid metabolism, and it is a complication that requires lifelong dietary intervention. The example design is provided to illustrate the importance of using omics technology to see if the intervention elevates neuroactive biogenic amines in the plasma; increases the abundance of <i>Eubacterium rectale, Coprococcus eutactus, Akkermansia muciniphila</i>, or <i>Butyricicoccus</i>; and increases <i>Escherichia/Shigella</i> in the gut, all as markers of improved health. By emphasizing the combined importance of diet, microbial supplements, and the gut microbiome, we hope that future studies will better align these components, not only to improve outcomes, but also to enhance our understanding of the mechanisms."

    "title": "Identification of deep intronic variants of PAH in phenylketonuria using full-length gene sequencing.",
    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an autosomal recessive congenital metabolic disorder caused by PAH variants. Previously, approximately 5% of PKU patients remained undiagnosed after Sanger sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. To date, increasing numbers of pathogenic deep intronic variants have been reported in more than 100 disease-associated genes. In this study, we performed full-length sequencing of PAH to investigate the deep intronic variants in PAH of PKU patients without definite genetic diagnosis. We identified five deep intronic variants (c.1199+502A>T, c.1065+241C>A, c.706+368T>C, c.706+531>C, and c.706+608A>C). Of these, the c.1199+502A>T variant was found at high frequency and may be a hotspot PAH variant in Chinese PKU. c.706+531T>C and c.706+608A>C are two novel variants that extend the deep intronic variant spectrum of PAH. Deep intronic variant pathogenicity analysis can further improve the genetic diagnosis of PKU patients. In silico prediction and minigene analysis are powerful approaches for studying the functions and effects of deep intronic variants. Targeted sequencing after full-length gene amplification is an economical and effective tool for the detection of deep intron variation in genes with small fragments."

    "title": "In search of environmental risk factors for obsessive-compulsive disorder: Study protocol for the OCDTWIN project.",
    "abstract": "<b>Background</b> The causes of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) remain unknown. Gene-searching efforts are well underway, but the identification of environmental risk factors is at least as important and should be a priority because some of them may be amenable to prevention or early intervention strategies. Genetically informative studies, particularly those employing the discordant monozygotic (MZ) twin design, are ideally suited to study environmental risk factors. This protocol paper describes the study rationale, aims, and methods of OCDTWIN, an open cohort of MZ twin pairs who are discordant for the diagnosis of OCD. <b>Methods</b> OCDTWIN has two broad aims. In Aim 1, we are recruiting MZ twin pairs from across Sweden, conducting thorough clinical assessments, and building a biobank of biological specimens, including blood, saliva, urine, stool, hair, nails, and multimodal brain imaging. A wealth of early life exposures (e.g., perinatal variables, health-related information, psychosocial stressors) are available through linkage with the nationwide registers and the Swedish Twin Registry. Blood spots stored in the Swedish phenylketonuria (PKU) biobank will be available to extract DNA, proteins, and metabolites, providing an invaluable source of biomaterial taken at birth. In Aim 2, we will perform within-pair comparisons of discordant MZ twins, which will allow us to isolate unique environmental risk factors that are in the causal pathway to OCD, while strictly controlling for genetic and early shared environmental influences. To date (May 2023), 43 pairs of twins (21 discordant for OCD) have been recruited. <b>Discussion</b> OCDTWIN hopes to generate unique insights into environmental risk factors that are in the causal pathway to OCD, some of which have the potential of being actionable targets."

    "title": "<i>PAH</i> Pathogenic Variants and Clinical Correlations in a Group of Hyperphenylalaninemia Patients from North-Western Romania.",
    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is caused by mutations in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (<i>PAH</i>) gene and is characterized by altered amino acid metabolism. More than 1500 known <i>PAH</i> variants intricately determine a spectrum of metabolic phenotypes. We aim to report on clinical presentation and <i>PAH</i> variants identified in 23 hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA)/PKU Romanian patients. Our cohort exhibited classic PKU (73.9%, 17/23), mild PKU (17.4%, 4/23), and mild HPA (8.7%, 2/23). Severe central nervous system sequelae are frequent in our cohort in late-diagnosis symptomatic patients, which highlights yet again the significance of an early dietary treatment, neonatal screening and diagnosis, and facilitated access to treatment. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) identified a total of 11 <i>PAH</i> pathogenic variants, all previously reported, mostly missense changes (7/11) in important catalytic domains. c.1222C>T p.Arg408Trp was the most frequent variant, with an allele frequency of 56.5%. Twelve distinct genotypes were identified, the most frequent of which was p.Arg408Trp/p.Arg408Trp (34.8%, 8/23). Compound heterozygous genotypes were common (13/23), three of which had not been previously reported to the best of our knowledge; two correlated with cPKU and one showed an mPKU phenotype. Generally, there are genotype-phenotype correlation overlaps with the public data reported in BIOPKUdb; as our study shows, clinical correlates are subject to variation, in part due to uncontrolled or unknown epigenetic or environmental regulatory factors. We highlight the importance of establishing the genotype on top of using blood phenylalanine levels."

The Danish Neonatal Screening Biobank contains blood from the Phenylketonuria-screening test. Legal, ethical, and moral concerns have been raised in several countries of how consent is obtained best in pediatric biobank governance. Research on knowledge and attitudes of Danish parents on the usage of their children's biological material is scarce. A coproduced study between a mother and 2 researchers. We analyzed 5 online focus group interviews using Ricoeur's hermeneutical narrative analysis. Mothers have very little knowledge on the storage and usage of their children's biological material. They consider the Phenylketonuria-screening test to be part of a birth package, which leaves very little option of choice. They accept donating the material as a token of appreciation in an act of altruism toward the wider society but are only comfortable supporting Danish research. An exploration of the communal narrative build in the interviews reveal an overall feeling of duty to help benefit society, an overwhelming trust toward the health system, and epistemic unjust storage information practices."

    "abstract": "To investigate the performance of 27 children with phenylketonuria (PKU) in tests of Executive Functions (EF) and Social Cognition (SC), and their associations with metabolic control inferred by phenylalanine (Phe) levels. The PKU group was dichotomized according to baseline Phe-levels into; \"classical PKU\"(n = 14), with Phe-levels above 1200 μmol/L (> 20 mg/dL); and \"mild PKU\" (n = 13) with Phe-between 360 and 1200 μmol/L (6-20 mg/dL). The neuropsychological assessment focused on the EF and SC subtests of the NEPSY-II battery and intellectual performance. Children were compared to age-matched healthy participants. Participants with PKU presented significantly lower Intellectual Quotient (IQ) compared to controls (p = 0.001). Regarding EF analysis adjusted by age and IQ, significant differences between groups were observed only in the executive attention subtests (p = 0.029). The SC set of variables was significantly different between groups (p = 0.003), as in the affective recognition task (p < 0.001). In the PKU group, the relative variation of Phe-achieved 32.1 ± 21.0%. Relative Phe-variation was correlated only with measures of Working Memory (p < 0.001), Verbal Fluency (p = 0.004), Inhibitory Control (p = 0.035) and Theory of Mind (p = 0.003). Phonological Verbal Fluency, Working Memory, Inhibitory Control, and Theory of Mind were shown to be most vulnerable when there is non-ideal metabolic control. Variations in the level of Phe-may have a selective negative effect on Executive Functions and Social Cognition, but not on intellectual performance."

    "title": "Increased cytokine levels induced by high phenylalanine concentrations in late diagnosis PKU patients compared to early diagnosis: Anti-inflammatory effect of L-carnitine.",
    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) was the first genetic disease to have an effective therapy, which consists of phenylalanine intake restriction. However, there are patients who do not adhere to treatment and/or are not submitted to neonatal screening. PKU patients present L-carnitine (L-car) deficiency, compound that has demonstrated an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory role in metabolic diseases. This study evaluated the effect caused by exposure time to high Phe levels in PKU patients at early and late diagnosis, through pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, as well as the L-car effect in patients under treatment. It was observed that there was a decrease in phenylalanine levels in treated patients compared to patients at diagnosis, and an increase in L-car levels in the patients under treatment. Inverse correlation between Phe versus L-car and nitrate plus nitrite versus L-car in PKU patients was also showed. We found increased proinflammatory cytokines levels: interleukin (IL)-1β, interferons (IFN)-gamma, IL-2, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, IL-8 and IL-6 in the patients at late diagnosis compared to controls, and IL-8 in the patients at early diagnosis and treatment compared to controls. Increased IL-2, TNF-alpha, IL-6 levels in the patients at late diagnosis compared to early diagnosis were shown, and reduced IL-6 levels in the treated patients compared to patients at late diagnosis. Moreover, it verified a negative correlation between IFN-gamma and L-car in treated patients. Otherwise, it was observed that there were increased IL-4 levels in the patients at late diagnosis compared to early diagnosis, and reduction in treated patients compared to late diagnosed patients. In urine, there was an increase in 8-isoprostane levels in the patients at diagnosis compared to controls and a decrease in oxidized guanine species in the treated patients compared to the diagnosed patients. Our results demonstrate for the first time in literature that time exposure to high Phe concentrations generates a proinflammatory status, especially in PKU patients with late diagnosis. A pro-oxidant status was verified in not treated PKU patients. Our results demonstrate the importance of early diagnosis and prompt start of treatment, in addition to the importance of L-car supplementation, which can improve cellular defense against inflammation and oxidative damage in PKU patients."

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is the most prevalent congenital disease of amino acid metabolism. Neurological manifestations usually complicate PKU in untreated adult patients. This study describes neurological and imaging phenotypes of adult patients with untreated PKU. We investigated a cohort of 320 unrelated adult patients with suspected genetic leukoencephalopathies using whole-exome sequencing (WES). We analyzed the phenotypic features of adult PKU patients in our cohort and summarized cases reported in the literature. We identified 10 patients in our cohort and 12 patients in the literature, who presented with neurological manifestations and were diagnosed with PKU in adulthood. Approximately 60% of these patients had onset of clinical features in adulthood. The most common neurological symptoms of patients presenting in adulthood were cognitive disturbance and spastic paralysis, followed by vision loss, cerebellar ataxia, weakness of limbs, and seizure. This differed from that of patients presenting with PKU features in childhood, who consistently had mental retardation with various neurological complications emerging during a broad age range. Imaging findings were similar between patients presenting with clinical features in childhood compared with adulthood, comprising symmetric periventricular white matter hyperintense on T2-weighted imaging and diffusion-weighted imaging predominantly in the parietal and occipital lobes. Also, normal brain imaging and diffuse leukoencephalopathies were observed in both patient groups. PKU with clinical features presenting in adulthood is an atypical subtype and should be considered during diagnosis of adults with neurological symptoms and leukoencephalopathy. DWI seems to be most helpful to distinguish patients with PKU. Additionally, we demonstrate that PKU constitutes a part (3.1%) of adult genetic leukoencephalopathies."

    "abstract": "Hyperphenylalaninemia is a biomarker for several monogenic neurotransmitter disorders where the body cannot metabolise phenylalanine to tyrosine. Biallelic pathogenic variants in DNAJC12, co-chaperone of phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan hydroxylases, leads to hyperphenylalaninemia and biogenic amines deficiency. A male firstborn to non-consanguineous Sudanese parents had hyperphenylalaninemia 247 µmol/L [reference interval (RI) < 200 µmol/L] at newborn screening. Dried blood spot dihydropteridine reductase (DHPR) assay and urine pterins were normal. He had severe developmental delay and autism spectrum disorder without a notable movement disorder. A low phenylalanine diet was introduced at two years without any clinical improvements. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) neurotransmitters at five years demonstrated low homovanillic acid (HVA) 0.259 µmol/L (reference interval (RI) 0.345-0.716) and 5-hydroxyindoleaetic acid (5HIAA) levels 0.024 µmol/L (reference interval (RI) 0.100-0.245). Targeted neurotransmitter gene panel analysis identified a homozygous c.78 + 1del variant in DNAJC12. At six years, he was commenced on 5-hydroxytryptophan 20 mg daily, and his protein-restricted diet was liberalised, with continued good control of phenylalanine levels. Sapropterin dihydrochloride 7.2 mg/kg/day was added the following year with no observable clinical benefits. He remains globally delayed with severe autistic traits. Urine, CSF neurotransmitter studies, and genetic testing will differentiate between phenylketonuria, tetrahydrobiopterin or DNAJC12 deficiency, with the latter characterised by a clinical spectrum ranging from mild autistic features or hyperactivity to severe intellectual disability, dystonia, and movement disorder, normal DHPR, reduced CSF HIAA and HVA. DNAJC12 deficiency should be considered early in the differential workup of hyperphenylalaninemia identified from newborn screening, with its genotyping performed once deficiencies of phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) and tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) have been biochemically or genetically excluded."

    "abstract": "Lacking direct neuropathological data, neuroimaging exploration has become the most powerful tool to give insight into pathophysiological alterations of early-treated PKU (ETPKU) patients. We conducted a systematic review of neuroimaging studies in ETPKU patients to explore 1) the occurrence of consistent neuroimaging alterations; 2) the relationship between them and neurological and cognitive disorders; 3) the contribution of neuroimaging in the insight of neuropathological background of ETPKU subjects; 4) whether brain neuroimaging may provide additional information in the monitoring of the disease course. Thirty-eight studies met the inclusion criteria for the full-text review, including morphological T1/T2 sequences, diffusion brain imaging (DWI/DTI) studies, brain MRI volumetric, functional neuroimaging studies, neurotransmission and brain energetic imaging studies. Non-progressive brain white matter changes were the most frequent and precocious alterations. As confirmed in hundreds of young adults with ETPKU, they affect over 90% of ETPKU patients. Consistent correlations are emerging between microstructural alteration (as detected by DWI/DTI) and metabolic control, which have also been confirmed in a few interventional trials. Volumetric studies detected later and less consistent cortical and subcortical grey matter alterations, which seem to be influenced by the patient's age and metabolic control. The few functional neuroimaging studies so far showed preliminary but interesting data about cortical activation patterns, skill performance, and brain connectivity. Further research is mandatory in these more complex areas. Recurrent methodological limitations include restricted sample sizes concerning the clinical variability of the disease, large age-range, variable measures of metabolic control, and prevalence of cross-sectional rather than longitudinal interventional studies."

    "title": "Phenylketonuria and the brain.",
    "abstract": "Classic phenylketonuria (PKU) is caused by defective activity of phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH), the enzyme that coverts phenylalanine (Phe) to tyrosine. Toxic accumulation of phenylalanine and its metabolites, left untreated, affects brain development and function depending on the timing of exposure to elevated levels. The specific mechanisms of Phe-induced brain damage are not completely understood, but they correlate to phenylalanine levels and on the stage of brain growth. During fetal life, high levels of phenylalanine such as those seen in maternal PKU can result in microcephaly, neuronal loss and corpus callosum hypoplasia. Elevated phenylalanine levels during the first few years of life can cause acquired microcephaly, severe cognitive impairment and epilepsy, likely due to the impairment of synaptogenesis. During late childhood, elevated phenylalanine can cause alterations in neurological functioning, leading to ADHD, speech delay and mild IQ reduction. In adolescents and adults, executive function and mood are affected, with some of the abnormalities reversed by better control of phenylalanine levels. Altered brain myelination can be present at this stage. In this article, we review the current knowledge about the consequences of high phenylalanine levels in PKU patients and animal models through different stages of brain development and its effect on cognitive, behavioural and neuropsychological function."

The amount of amino acid was quantitatively recognized by optical absorption measurements at 452 nm through the conversion of Ru (byp)<sub>3</sub> <sup>3+</sup> to Ru (byp)<sub>3</sub> <sup>2+</sup>, which is induced by the neoformed NADH. A detection limit of 0.33 µM, a limit of quantification of 1.01 µM, and a sensitivity of 36.6 a.u nM<sup>-1</sup> were obtained. The proposed method was successfully tested using biological specimens from patients affected by hyperphenylalaninemia.

The NIH Toolbox represents a relatively new computer-administered assessment tool and provides a sampling of performance across multiple cognitive domains, several of which (e.g., executive function, processing speed) are at risk for disruption in ETPKU. The goal of the present study was to provide an initial evaluation of the value and sensitivity of the NIH Toolbox for use with individuals with ETPKU. To this end, a sample of adults with ETPKU and a demographically-matched comparison group without PKU completed the cognitive and motor batteries of the Toolbox. Results indicate that overall performance (as reflected by the Fluid Cognition Composite) was sensitive to both group differences (ETPKU vs non-PKU) as well as blood Phe levels (a marker of metabolic control). The present findings offer preliminary support for the utility of the NIH Toolbox as a measure of neurocognitive functioning in individuals with ETPKU. Future research including a larger sample size and broader age range is needed to fully validate the Toolbox for clinical and research use with individuals with ETPKU."

We analyzed the variants of PAH exons, their flanking sequences, and introns. The detection of deep intronic variants in PAH gene can significantly improve the genetic diagnostic rate of PKU. The distribution of PAH variants among PKU subtypes may be related to the unique genetic background in Gansu, China. The identification of PAH hotspot variants will aid the development of large-scale neonatal genetic screening for PKU. The five new PAH variants found in this study further expand the spectrum of PAH variants.

Since its European approval, German metabolic centres have gained valuable experience, which may be of benefit to other treatment centres managing patients on pegvaliase. After a virtual meeting that was attended by nine German physicians, three German dietitians and one American physician, a follow-up discussion was held via an online platform to develop a set of recommendations on the use of pegvaliase in Germany. Eight German physicians contributed to the follow-up discussion and subsequent consensus voting, using a modified Delphi technique. The recommendations were supported by literature and retrospectively collected patient data. Consensus (≥75% agreement) was achieved on 25 recommendations, covering seven topics deemed relevant by the expert panel when considering pegvaliase an option for the treatment of patients with PKU. In addition to the recommendations, a retrospective chart review was conducted in seven of the centres and included 71 patients who initiated treatment with pegvaliase. Twenty-seven patients had been treated for at least 24 months and 23 (85.2%) had achieved blood Phe ≤600 μmol/L with some degree of diet normalisation. Of these patients, 14 had physiological blood Phe on a normalised diet. The practical consensus recommendations provide guidance on the different steps along the pegvaliase journey from clinical site requirements to treatment goals and outcomes. The recommendations are intended to support less experienced European metabolic centres with the implementation of pegvaliase, emphasising that a core treatment team consisting of at least a dietitian and metabolic physician is sufficient to initiate pegvaliase and support patients during their treatment journey."

This systematic review supported by expert opinion aims to raise awareness among the neurological community on neurological complications experienced by adults with PKU (AwPKU). The PubMed database was searched for articles on neurological signs and symptoms in AwPKU published before March 2022. In addition, two virtual advisory boards were held with a panel of seven neurologists and two metabolic physicians from Germany and Austria. Findings are supported by three illustrative patient cases. Thirty-nine articles were included. Despite early diagnosis and treatment, neurological signs and symptoms (e.g. ataxia, brisk tendon reflexes, tremor, visual impairment) can emerge in adulthood, especially if treatment has been discontinued after childhood. In PKU, late-onset neurological deficits often co-occur with cognitive impairment and psychiatric symptoms, all of which can be completely or partially reversed through resumption of treatment. Ideally, neurologists should be part of the PKU multidisciplinary team, either to bring lost to follow-up patients back to clinic or to manage symptoms in referred patients, considering that symptoms are often reversible upon regaining metabolic control. The current findings have been combined in a leaflet that will be disseminated among neurologists in Germany and Austria to create awareness."

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria is an inborn error of phenylalanine metabolism caused by a phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency. To prevent the occurrence of neurological symptoms and maternal complications resulting from phenylketonuria, patients must adhere to a strict diet therapy, tetrahydrobiopterin supplementation, or pegvaliase injection to maintain blood phenylalanine levels within a recommended range throughout their lives. Therefore, monitoring blood phenylalanine levels is necessary to determine the recent metabolic status of phenylalanine in patients with PKU; however, there are no available instruments for individuals to monitor their own blood phenylalanine levels using whole fingertip blood. We developed a phenylalanine monitoring system (designated as PheCheck) that included a pre-existing portable ammonia detection device and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, which converts phenylalanine to trans-cinnamic acid and ammonia. This system was able to remove 86.7% ± 0.03% of the ammonia contained in fingertip blood and successfully reduce background ammonia levels. A good correlation was found between the estimated plasma phenylalanine levels detected by PheCheck and plasma phenylalanine levels detected by high-performance liquid chromatography (R<sup>2</sup> 0.97). The entire PheCheck process for measuring blood phenylalanine takes only 20 min. PheCheck can lay the foundation for home phenylalanine monitoring with high feasibility because all the components are easily accessible. Further studies with a more user-friendly PheCheck optimized for practice are needed to improve blood phenylalanine control, reduce the burden on patients and/or caregivers, and prevent the sequelae associated with phenylketonuria."

A total of 1291 PKU patients with 623 various variants were used as the training dataset for predicting allelic phenotypes. We designed a common machine learning framework to predict allelic genotypes associated with the phenotype. We identified 235 different mutations and 623 various allelic genotypes. The features extracted from the structure of mutations and graph properties of the PKU network to predict the phenotype of PKU were named PPML (PKU phenotype predicted by machine learning). The phenotype of PKU was classified into three different categories: classical PKU (cPKU), mild PKU (mPKU) and mild hyperphenylalaninemia (MHP). Three hub nodes (c.728G>A for cPKU, c.721 for mPKU and c.158G>A for HPA) were used as each classification center, and 5 node attributes were extracted from the network graph for machine learning training features. The area under the ROC curve was AUC = 0.832 for cPKU, AUC = 0.678 for mPKU and AUC = 0.874 for MHP. This suggests that PPML is a powerful method to predict allelic phenotypes in PKU and can be used for genetic counseling of PKU families.

A volumetric absorptive microsampling (VAMS) dried blood collection high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) method was developed and fully validated for blood Phe measurement in compliance with regulatory guidances. The method accuracy, precision, stability, selectivity, matrix and hematocrit effects were assessed. A venous plasma collection HPLC-MS/MS method was developed and validated as a reference method. 311 matching VAMS and plasma samples were collected from 24 PKU subjects in a Phase 2 clinical study. Phe measurements using the two methods were compared. Both VAMS and the plasma sample collection methods met the acceptance criteria for Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) bioanalytical analysis. Comparisons showed a high Pearson's correlation of 0.9813. The Passing-Bablok analysis showed that the difference was estimated to be less than 5% and Bland Altman analysis indicated that the difference was proportional with Phe concentration and for the majority of samples (88.85%) the measurement was within ±20% difference. Following 7 days treatment with 60 or 20 mg/kg/day PTC923 (Sepiapterin) or 20 mg/kg/day sapropterin, PKU patients exhibited respectively -206.4, -146.9, and -91.5 µmol/L reductions of blood Phe as measured by the VAMS method. Concordant results were obtained using VAMS and plasma methods, which demonstrated that VAMS is a reliable method for clinical applications to monitor blood Phe for PKU patients."

The process of passing skills and responsibilities from pediatric team to adult team is defined \"transition\". The goal of transition clinics is to set up specific multidisciplinary care pathways and guarantee continuity of care and compliance of patients to care. In 2017, \"The complete European guidelines on phenylketonuria\" were published. These guidelines, however, do not provide an easy way to illustrate to adult patients how to follow correct dietary approach. The purpose of this review is to evaluate current evidence on optimum dietary treatment of adults with phenylketonuria and to provide food pyramid for this population. The pyramid built shows that carbohydrates should be consumed every day (3 portions), together with fruits and vegetables (5 portions), extra virgin olive oil, and calcium water (almost 1 L/day); weekly portions can include 150 g potatoes walnuts and hazelnuts (20 g). At top of pyramid, there are two pennants. The green means that, based on individual metabolic phenotype and daily phenylalanine tolerance, patients need personalized supplementation (specific phenylalanine free amino acid mixtures, vitamins and omega 3 fatty acids); the one red indicates foods that are banned from diet (aspartame and protein foods exceeding individual dietary phenylalanine tolerance)."

    "title": "Current Landscape on Development of Phenylalanine and Toxicity of its Metabolites - A Review.",
    "abstract": "Phenylalanine, an essential amino acid, is the \"building block\" of protein. It has a tremendous role in different aspects of metabolic events. The tyrosine pathway is the prime one and is typically used to degrade dietary phenylalanine. Phenylalanine exceeds its limit in bodily fluids and the brain when the enzyme, phenylalanine decarboxylase, phenylalanine transaminase, phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) or its cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) is deficient causes phenylketonuria, schizophrenia, attentiondeficit/ hyperactivity disorder and another neuronal effect. Tyrosine, an amino acid necessary for synthesizing the pigments in melanin, is produced by its primary metabolic pathway. Deficiency/abnormality in metabolic enzymes responsible for the catabolism pathway of Phenylalanine causes an accumulation of the active intermediate metabolite, resulting in several abnormalities, such as developmental delay, tyrosinemias, alkaptonuria, albinism, hypotension and several other undesirable conditions. Dietary restriction of the amino acid(s) can be a therapeutic approach to avoid such undesirable conditions when the level of metabolic enzyme is unpredictable. After properly identifying the enzymatic level, specific pathophysiological conditions can be managed more efficiently."

    "abstract": "Recently, variants in DNAJC12 were reported to be a novel genetic cause of hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA); however, thus far, fewer than fifty cases have been reported worldwide. Some patients with DNAJC12 deficiency present with mild HPA, developmental delay, dystonia, Parkinson's disease and psychiatric abnormalities. Herein, we report the case of a two-month-old Chinese infant with mild HPA, detected by newborn screening. Genetic etiology of the HPA patient was analyzed by Next-generation sequencing (NGS) and Sanger sequencing. Functional consequences of this variant were investigated using an in vitro minigene splicing assay. Two novel compound heterozygous variants in DNAJC12, c.158-1G > A and c.336delG, were detected in our patient with asymptomatic HPA. The c.158-1G > A canonical splice-site variant demonstrated mis-splicing on an in vitro minigene assay and was predicted to lead to introduction of a premature termination codon p.(Val53AspfsTer15). In silico prediction tools designated c.336delG as a truncating variant leading to a frameshift p.(Met112IlefsTer44). Both variants segregated with unaffected parents and were annotated as \"likely pathogenic\". In this study, we report an infant with mild HPA and compound heterozygous variants in DNAJC12. For patients with HPA, DNAJC12 deficiency should be considered when phenylalanine hydroxylase and tetrahydrobiopterin metabolic defects are excluded."

    "abstract": "Ancient anatomically modern humans (AMHs) encountered other archaic human species, most notably Neanderthals and Denisovans, when they left Africa and spread across Europe and Asia ~60,000 years ago. They interbred with them, and modern human genomes retain DNA inherited from these interbreeding events. High quality (high coverage) ancient human genomes have recently been sequenced allowing for a direct estimation of individual heterozygosity, which has shown that genetic diversity in these archaic human groups was very low, indicating low population sizes. In this study, we analyze ten ancient human genome-wide data, including four sequenced with high-coverage. We screened these ancient genome-wide data for pathogenic mutations associated with monogenic diseases, and established unusual aggregation of pathogenic mutations in individual subjects, including quadruple homozygous cases of pathogenic variants in the <i>PAH</i> gene associated with the condition phenylketonuria in a ~120,000 years old Neanderthal. Such aggregation of pathogenic mutations is extremely rare in contemporary populations, and their existence in ancient humans could be explained by less significant clinical manifestations coupled with small community sizes, leading to higher inbreeding levels. Our results suggest that pathogenic variants associated with rare diseases might be the result of introgression from other archaic human species, and archaic admixture thus could have influenced disease risk in modern humans."

    "abstract": "In 1963, Robert Guthrie's pioneering work developing a bacterial inhibition assay to measure phenylalanine in dried blood spots, provided the means for whole-population screening to detect phenylketonuria in the USA. In the following decades, NBS became firmly established as a part of public health in developed countries. Technological advances allowed for the addition of new disorders into routine programmes and thereby resulted in a paradigm shift. Today, technological advances in immunological methods, tandem mass spectrometry, PCR techniques, DNA sequencing for mutational variant analysis, ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UPLC), iso-electric focusing, and digital microfluidics are employed in the NBS laboratory to detect more than 60 disorders. In this review, we will provide the current state of methodological advances that have been introduced into NBS. Particularly, 'second-tier' methods have significantly improved both the specificity and sensitivity of testing. We will also present how proteomic and metabolomic techniques can potentially improve screening strategies to reduce the number of false-positive results and improve the prediction of pathogenicity. Additionally, we discuss the application of complex, multiparameter statistical procedures that use large datasets and statistical algorithms to improve the predictive outcomes of tests. Future developments, utilizing genomic techniques, are also likely to play an increasingly important role, possibly combined with artificial intelligence (AI)-driven software. We will consider the balance required to harness the potential of these new advances whilst maintaining the benefits and reducing the risks for harm associated with all screening."

    "abstract": "Untreated phenylketonuria (PKU) patients and PKU animal models show hypomyelination in the central nervous system and white matter damages, which are accompanied by myelin basic protein (MBP) impairment. Despite many assumptions, the primary explanation of the mentioned cerebral outcomes remains elusive. In this study, MBP protein and mRNA expression on brains of wild type (WT) and phenylketonuric (ENU2) mice were analyzed throughout mice lifespan (14-60-180-270-360-540 post-natal days, PND). The results confirmed the low MBP expression at first PND times, while revealed an unprecedented progressive MBP protein expression recovery in aged ENU2 mice. Unexpectedly, unaltered MBP mRNA expression between WT and ENU2 was always observed. Additionally, for the same time intervals, a significant decrease of the phenylalanine concentration in the peripheral blood and brain of ENU2 mice was detected, to date, for the first time. In this scenario, a translational hindrance of MBP during initial and late cerebral development in ENU2 mice was hypothesized, leading to the execution of a microRNA microarray analysis on 60 PND brains, which was followed by a proteomic assay on 60 and 360 PND brains in order to validate in silico miRNA-target predictions. Taken together, miR-218-1-3p, miR-1231-3p and miR-217-5p were considered as the most impactful microRNAs, since a downregulation of their potential targets (MAG, CNTNAP2 and ANLN, respectively) can indirectly lead to a low MBP protein expression. These miRNAs, in addition, follow an opposite expression trend compared to MBP during adulthood, and their target proteins revealed a complete normalization in aged ENU2 mice. In conclusion, these results provide a new perspective on the PKU pathophysiology understanding and on a possible treatment, emphasizing the potential modulating role of differentially expressed microRNAs in MBP expression on PKU brains during PKU mouse lifespan."

There was a highly positive association between knowledge and reported practice (.674 and .398). The self-learning package had a positive impact on mothers' knowledge and practices. Consequently, educational programs should be provided to all mothers of newly diagnosed cases to improve their children's adherence to the therapeutic regimen."

    "abstract": "Inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) can lead to severe motor and neurological developmental disorders and even disability and death in children due to untimely treatment. In this study, we used tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) for primary screening and recall of those with positive primary screening for rescreening. Further diagnosis was based on biochemical tests, imaging and clinical presentation as well as accurate genetic testing using multi-gene panel with high-throughput sequencing of 130 IEM-related genes. The screening population was 16,207 newborns born between July 1, 2019, and December 31, 2021. Based on the results, 8 newborns were diagnosed with IEM, constituting a detection rate of 1:2,026. Phenylketonuria was the most common form of IEM. In addition, seven genes associated with IEM were detected in these eight patients. All eight patients received standardized treatment starting in the neonatal period, and the follow-up results showed good growth and development. Therefore, our study suggests that MS/MS rescreening for IEM pathogenic variants in high-risk areas, combined with a sequencing validation strategy, can be highly effective in the early detection of affected children. This strategy, combined with early intervention, can be effective in preventing neonatal morbidity and improving population quality."

    "title": "Competitive, multi-objective, and compartmented Flux Balance Analysis for addressing tissue-specific inborn errors of metabolism.",
    "abstract": "The inborn error of metabolism phenylketonuria (PKU, OMIM 261600) is most often due to inactivation of phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH), which converts phenylalanine (Phe) into tyrosine (Tyr). The reduced PAH activity increases blood concentration of phenylalanine and urine levels of phenylpyruvate. Flux balance analysis (FBA) of a single-compartment model of PKU predicts that maximum growth rate should be reduced unless Tyr is supplemented. However, the PKU phenotype is lack of development of brain function specifically, and Phe reduction rather than Tyr supplementation cures the disease. Phe and Tyr cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) through the aromatic amino acid transporter implying that the two transport reactions interact. However, FBA does not accommodate such competitive interactions. We here report on an extension to FBA that enables it to deal with such interactions. We built a three-compartment model, made the common transport across the BBB explicit, and included dopamine and serotonin synthesis as parts of the brain function to be delivered by FBA. With these ramifications, FBA of the genome-scale metabolic model extended to three compartments does explain that (i) the disease is brain specific, (ii) phenylpyruvate in urine is a biomarker, (iii) excess of blood-phenylalanine rather than shortage of blood-tyrosine causes brain pathology, and (iv) Phe deprivation is the better therapy. The new approach also suggests (v) explanations for differences in pathology between individuals with the same PAH inactivation, and (vi) interference of disease and therapy with the functioning of other neurotransmitters."

    "abstract": "In phenylketonuria (PKU), high phenylalanine (Phe) levels hamper neurodevelopment impairing executive function later in life. While the second has been more studied, fewer data exist on predictors of PKU patients' development in specific populations. To contribute to the field, we performed a retrospective analysis of predictors of neurodevelopment in PKU patients in a Portuguese cohort. We analyzed the retrospective data on the metabolic control of 89 patients, as their health and familial features. Griffith's Mental Development Scale performance at age 6 (GMDS6) was used to assess neurodevelopment. Our cohort included 14 GMDS6<sub>low</sub> and 75 GMDS6<sub>high</sub> patients. In a multivariate analysis, the better predictors of neurodevelopment were the metabolic control at age 3 and year of birth (n = 87, β<sub>0</sub> = -121, β<sub>1</sub> = -1.77, β<sub>2</sub> = 0.06, LRchi2(2) = 13.61, Prob > chi2 = 0.001, Pseudo R2 = 0.1773). With this model, it was possible to define a safety cut-off of 7.8 mg/dL for the Phe level at age 3 (sensitivity = 72.6%, specificity = 78.6%), confirming the safety of the cut-off of 6 mg/dL already used in the clinical practice. Our study supports the relevance of metabolic control to predict the neurodevelopment of PKU patients, in the historical context of the disease management."

They are increasingly more common in adults due to improved management. This has allowed more affected women to consider having children with good prospects. However, pregnancy may worsen metabolic control and/or increase maternal-fetal complications. The objective is to analyse the characteristics and outcomes of pregnancies of our patients with IEM. Retrospective descriptive study. Pregnancies of women with IEM attended to at the adult IEM referral unit of the Hospital Universitario Virgen del Rocío were included. The qualitative variables were described as n(%) and the quantitative as P50 (P25-P75). 24 pregnancies were recorded: 12 newborns were healthy, 1 inherited their mother's disease, 2 had maternal phenylketonuria syndrome, 1 was stillborn (gestational week 31 + 5), 5 were spontaneous abortions and 3 were voluntarily terminated. The gestations were divided into metabolically controlled and uncontrolled. Pregnancy planning and multidisciplinary management through to postpartum is essential to ensure maternal and fetal health. The basis of treatment in PKU and TSII is a strict protein-limited diet. Events that increase protein catabolism in organic acidaemias and DOTC should be avoided. Further investigation of pregnancy outcomes in women with IEM is needed."

    "abstract": "The United Nations recently made a call to address the challenges of an estimated 300 million persons worldwide living with a rare disease through the collection, analysis, and dissemination of disaggregated data. Epidemiologic Information (EI) regarding prevalence and incidence data of rare diseases is sparse and current paradigms of identifying, extracting, and curating EI rely upon time-intensive, error-prone manual processes. With these limitations, a clear understanding of the variation in epidemiology and outcomes for rare disease patients is hampered. This challenges the public health of rare diseases patients through a lack of information necessary to prioritize research, policy decisions, therapeutic development, and health system allocations. In this study, we developed a newly curated epidemiology corpus for Named Entity Recognition (NER), a deep learning framework, and a novel rare disease epidemiologic information pipeline named EpiPipeline4RD consisting of a web interface and Restful API. For the corpus creation, we programmatically gathered a representative sample of rare disease epidemiologic abstracts, utilized weakly-supervised machine learning techniques to label the dataset, and manually validated the labeled dataset. For the deep learning framework development, we fine-tuned our dataset and adapted the BioBERT model for NER. We measured the performance of our BioBERT model for epidemiology entity recognition quantitatively with precision, recall, and F1 and qualitatively through a comparison with Orphanet. We demonstrated the ability for our pipeline to gather, identify, and extract epidemiology information from rare disease abstracts through three case studies. We developed a deep learning model to extract EI with overall F1 scores of 0.817 and 0.878, evaluated at the entity-level and token-level respectively, and which achieved comparable qualitative results to Orphanet's collection paradigm. Additionally, case studies of the rare diseases Classic homocystinuria, GRACILE syndrome, Phenylketonuria demonstrated the adequate recall of abstracts with epidemiology information, high precision of epidemiology information extraction through our deep learning model, and the increased efficiency of EpiPipeline4RD compared to a manual curation paradigm. EpiPipeline4RD demonstrated high performance of EI extraction from rare disease literature to augment manual curation processes. This automated information curation paradigm will not only effectively empower development of the NIH Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center (GARD), but also support the public health of the rare disease community."

    "abstract": "Phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) deficiency or phenylketonuria (PKU) is the most common cause of hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA), and approximately 5% of patients remain genetically unsolved. Identifying deep intronic PAH variants may help improve their molecular diagnostic rate. Next-generation sequencing was utilized to detect the whole PAH gene in 96 patients with genetically unsolved HPA from 2013 to 2022. The effects of deep intronic variants on pre-mRNA splicing were investigated by minigene-based assay. The allelic phenotype values of recurrent deep intronic variants were calculated. Twelve deep intronic PAH variants, located in intron 5 (c.509+434C>T), intron 6 (c.706+288T>G, c.706+519T>C, c.706+531T>C, c.706+535G>T, c.706+600A>C, c.706+603T>G, and c.706+608A>C), intron 10 (c.1065+241C>A and c.1065+258C>A), and intron 11 (c.1199+502A>T and c.1199+745T>A) were identified in 80.2% (77/96) patients. Ten of the 12 variants were novel, and they all generated pseudoexons in mRNA, leading to frameshift or lengthened proteins. The most prevalent deep intronic variant was c.1199+502A>T, followed by c.1065+241C>A, c.1065+258C>A, and c.706+531T>C. The metabolic phenotypes of the four variants were assigned as classic PKU, mild HPA, mild HPA, and mild PKU, respectively. The results suggest that deep intronic PAH variants improved the diagnostic rate from 95.3% to 99.3% in the overall patients with HPA. Our data demonstrate the importance of assessing noncoding variants in genetic diseases. Pseudoexon inclusion caused by deep intronic variants may represent a recurrent mechanism."

The development of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology provides new opportunities to expand current newborn screening methodologies. We designed a a newborn genetic screening (NBGS) panel targeting 135 genes associated with 75 inborn disorders by multiplex PCR combined with NGS. With this panel, a large-scale, multicenter, prospective multidisease analysis was conducted on dried blood spot (DBS) profiles from 21,442 neonates nationwide. We presented the positive detection rate and carrier frequency of diseases and related variants in different regions; and 168 (0.78%) positive cases were detected. Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PDD) and phenylketonuria (PKU) had higher prevalence rates, which were significantly different in different regions. The positive detection of G6PD variants was quite common in south China, whereas PAH variants were most commonly identified in north China. In addition, NBGS identified 3 cases with DUOX2 variants and one with SLC25A13 variants, which were normal in conventional NBS, but were confirmed later as abnormal in repeated biochemical testing after recall. Eighty percent of high-frequency gene carriers and 60% of high-frequency variant carriers had obvious regional differences. On the premise that there was no significant difference in birth weight and gestational age, the biochemical indicators of SLC22A5 c.1400C > G and ACADSB c.1165A > G carriers were significantly different from those of non-carriers. We demonstrated that NBGS is an effective strategy to identify neonates affected with treatable diseases as a supplement to current NBS methods. Our data also showed that the prevalence of diseases has significant regional characteristics, which provides a theoretical basis for screening diseases in different regions."

    "abstract": "Strict metabolic control with dietary treatment during pregnancy is essential for women with phenylketonuria (PKU), as elevated levels of phenylalanine (Phe) are toxic to the developing fetus. Maternal delay in achievement of the recommended Phe level during pregnancy is associated with delayed development of the child. However, the extent to which risk is changed by later or less stringently performed dietary treatment is unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of Phe levels and time of initiation of a Phe-restricted diet in pregnant women with PKU on birth weight, head circumference and later development of their children. Birth data were obtained from the medical records of women with PKU giving birth in the period 1980-2020. Later development was investigated by interviewing the mothers about their children's development and health. We included 79 children of 41 women with PKU. The women showed good adherence with the diet and had mean blood Phe levels within target range (248 ± 62 μmol/L). The children's development was not affected by fluctuations in the women's Phe levels, that occurred especially in first trimester. Despite maternal Phe levels being within target range, 19 children (26.8%) had low birth weight below 10th percentile. This study indicates that with dietary treatment, the children are born with the same prospect for normal development and health as children born to non-PKU mothers. This is despite maternal fluctuations in the Phe levels during first trimester."

We aimed to describe the protein energy ratio (P:E) and its association with body mass index (BMI) in 638 dietetic and anthropometric assessments from 54 early- or late-diagnosed HPA/PKU patients. Dietetic and anthropometric data were analyzed and classified according to BMI Z-Score and type of diagnosis, early by newborn screening (NBS) or late. Correlation between BMI Z-Score and P:E ratio was established. Percent of dietary protein from Phe-free metabolic formula was analyzed. According to the BMI Z-Score, the majority of assessments were eutrophic (69.4%). The median P:E ratio was >4 in most of the overweight assessments. Remarkably, the underweight group consumed the highest proportion of Phe-free metabolic formula (74.5%). A positive correlation between BMI Z-Score and P:E ratio was found. The highest proportion of underweight was found in the late-diagnosed patients. Our findings might be related to their nutritional history previous to the HPA/PKU treatment. Thus, complex nutritional outcome of the late-diagnosed HPA/PKU patients deserves actions to guarantee the early diagnosis, closer nutritional follow-up and alternative therapeutic approaches."

However, it still concerns that even if treated in the first months of life with supplements and following a diet, they can show slight scores below people without PKU in neuropsychological assignments. We investigated 20 adults with classical PKU aged 19-48 years (mean age 29 years) and 20 heathy controls matched by age, gender, and years of education. Patients and controls were assessed with an extended neuropsychological battery, as well as psychological aspects and quality of life, also the last Phe level result was obtained. Results showed that the most affected cognitive domains are processing speed, executive functioning, memory, and also theory of mind, but very well-preserved verbal fluency, language, and visuospatial functioning. In quality of life, some significant results were seen specially in anxiety of Phe levels, anxiety of Phe levels during pregnancy, guilt if poor adherence to supplements, and if dietary protein restriction not followed. No significant results were obtained for the psychological variables. In conclusion, it has been shown that a combination of a low Phe diet, supplement intake, and keeping Phe levels in a low range seems appropriate to have the most normal and alike cognitive performance to persons without PKU."

This review aims to summarize available data on excess weight in adult PKU individuals. We conducted a systematic search of literature in English, from inception to October 2021, on PubMed and Embase to identify articles on overweight and obesity in adult PKU patients. Prevalence of overweight and obesity, body mass index (BMI) and gender differences were the outcomes of interest. Of 260 articles identified, only 8 fulfilled quality criteria for inclusion after screening of titles, abstracts and full texts. The mean BMI of adult PKU patients in these studies ranged from 26 ± 5.4 to 30.3 ± 1.8 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. When compared to matched controls, adult PKU patients had higher BMI and higher prevalence of obesity. However, results were inconsistent when PKU adults were compared to the general population. The prevalence of obesity in the included studies varied widely between 4.5% up to 72% in individual studies. Obesity was 2-3 times more frequent in female PKU patients. Excess weight is frequent in adult PKU patients, especially in females, even if the difference with the general population is debatable. The heterogeneity of the studies makes it difficult to interpret the results and the factors that contribute to obesity. Content of the diet, psychological status, diet-associated disordered eating, patient's social environment and lifestyle are listed as potentials contributors to excess weight in PKU adult population. Further studies are needed to better elucidate this question. In the meantime, weight control and healthy eating habits should be considered in the management and follow-up of these patients."

Early treatment and good compliance result in a normal intellectual outcome in many but not in all patients. This study examined plasma metabolites in patients with PKU (n = 27), hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA, n = 1) and healthy controls (n = 32) by LC- MS/MS. We hypothesized that PKU patients would exhibit a distinct \"submetabolome\" compared to that of healthy controls. We further hypothesized that the submetabolome of PKU patients with good metabolic control would resemble that of healthy controls. Results from this study show: (i) Distinct clustering of healthy controls and PKU patients based on polar metabolite profiling, (ii) Increased and decreased concentrations of metabolites within and afar from the Phe pathway in treated patients, and (iii) A specific PKU-submetabolome independently of metabolic control assessed by Phe in plasma. We examined the relationship between PKU metabolic control and extended metabolite profiles in plasma. The PKU submetabolome characterized in this study represents the combined effects of dietary adherence, adjustments in metabolic pathways to compensate for defective Phe processing, as well as metabolic derangements that could not be corrected with dietary management even in patients classified as having good metabolic control. New therapeutic targets may be uncovered to approximate the PKU submetabolome to that of healthy controls and prevent long-term organ damage."

    "abstract": "The incidence of inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) varies across countries and areas. Currently, there are no studies on IEM using newborn screening (NBS) in eastern coastal areas of China. We aimed to estimate the incidence and genetic variants of IEM and understand the spectrum of diseases caused by IEM and variants among them in this area. The NBS performed by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) from 2016 to 2021 was retrospectively reviewed. Heel blood was collected from all newborns 72 h after birth. Targeted massively parallel sequencing was performed for genetic analysis. Among 245,194 newborns, 95 were diagnosed with IEM, the overall incidence observed was-IEM: 1/2581; amino acid metabolism disorder: 1/4715; organic acid metabolism disorder: 1/11676; and fatty acid metabolism disorder: 1/11145. The incidence of different IEM was in the range of 1/245194 to 1/6452. Phenylketonuria (PKU, 1/7211) was the most common IEM, followed by methylmalonic acidemia (MMA, 1/27244), short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (SCADD, 1/30649), and citrin deficiency (CD, 1/35028). For genetic variants, the common hotspot variants found were-PAH gene for PKU: c.728G > A, c.442-1G > A, c.611A > G, c.721C > T; PTS gene for non-classical PKU: c.259C > T; MMACHC gene for MMA: c.658_660delAAG, c.609G > A; MMUT gene for MMA: c.1663G > A; ACADS gene for SCADD: c.1031A > G and c.1130C > T; and SLC25A13 gene for CD: c.1638_1660dup, c.852_855del. This study displayed the diseases and varied spectrum of IEM in eastern coastal areas of China. Implementing NBS for IEM by MS/MS combined with massively parallel sequencing can offer an improved plan for NBS to detect IEM."

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) was the first disease to be identified by the newborn screening (NBS) program. Currently, there are various methods for determining phenylalanine (Phe) values, with tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) being the most widely used method worldwide. We aimed to compare the MS/MS method with the fluorometric method (FM) for measuring Phe in the dried blood spot (DBS) and the efficacy of both methods in the NBS program. The FM was performed using a neonatal phenylalanine kit and a VICTOR2<sup>TM</sup> D fluorometer. The MS/MS method was performed using a NeoBase<sup>TM</sup> 2 kit and a Waters Xevo TQD mass spectrometer. The Phe values measured with the MS/MS method were compared to those determined by the FM. The cut-off value for the NBS program was set at 120 µmol/L for FM and 85 µmol/L for MS/MS. We analyzed 54,934 DBS. The measured Phe values varied from 12 to 664 µmol/L, with a median of 46 µmol/L for the MS/MS method and from 10 to 710 µmol/L, with a median of 70 µmol/L for the FM. The Bland-Altman analysis indicated a bias of -38.9% (-23.61 µmol/L) with an SD of 21.3% (13.89 µmol/L) when comparing the MS/MS method to the FM. The Phe value exceeded the cut-off in 187 samples measured with FM and 112 samples measured with MS/MS. The FM had 181 false positives, while the MS/MS method had 106 false positives. Our study showed that the MS/MS method gives lower results compared to the FM. Despite that, none of the true positives would be missed, and the number of false-positive results would be significantly lower compared to the FM."

    "abstract": "Sapropterin has been approved as a treatment option for individuals with Phenylketonuria in the United Kingdom. Individuals are assessed as responsive to Sapropterin by a ≥30% reduction in Phenylalanine (Phe) concentrations using dried blood spot (DBS) specimens. DBS quality is critical for accurate and precise measurement of Phe. Currently, UK national guidelines for DBS specimen acceptance do not exist for patient-collected DBS specimens. We adopted evidence-based guidelines for specimen acceptance criteria and retrospectively assessed the impact of introducing these guidelines on specimen rejection rates. Methods: Laboratories were invited to audit the quality of DBS specimens routinely received for Phe monitoring using: (1) existing acceptance/rejection criteria and (2) proposed national guidelines. Ten laboratories audited 2111 specimens from 1094 individuals. Using existing local guidelines, the median rejection rate was 4.0% (IQR 1.5-7.2%). This increased to 21.9% (IQR 10.0-33.0%) using the proposed guidelines. Where reason(s) for rejection were provided (<i>n</i> = 299); 211/299 (70.6%) of DBS specimens were too small or multi-spotted. 380 individuals had more than one sample evaluated; 231/380 (60.8%) provided specimens of acceptable quality, 37/380 (9.7%) consistently provided poor-quality DBS specimens. There is significant variability in the quality of patient-collected DBS specimens. If unacceptable specimens are not rejected, imprecise/inaccurate results will be used in clinical decision making. Using annual workload data for England, this equates to 12,410 incorrect results. Individuals and parents/carers should receive ongoing training in blood collection technique to ensure use of evidence-based acceptability criteria does not cause undue distress from increased sample rejection rates."

    "abstract": "The context was designed to optimize the diagnostic utility of clinically focused exome sequencing (CFES) and shorten the diagnostic odyssey among pediatric patients suspected of monogenic disorders (MDs). Here, we retrospectively analyzed the clinical notes of 372 patients from different areas in the Jiangxi province that were referred for a diagnostic CFES and analysis from June 2018 to March 2022 with symptoms suggestive of MDs. In our study, preliminary tests using the proband-only clinical exome sequencing as a cost-effective first-tier diagnostic test for pediatric patients with unidentified MDs, supplemented by family segregation studies for targeted variants when indicated. Probands with confirmed diagnostic (CD) or likely diagnostic (LD) genetic influences accounted for 12% of all cases, whereas those with an uncertain diagnosis accounted for 48%. We also found that systemic primary carnitine deficiency (CDSP) (<i>SLC22A5</i> gene) and phenylketonuria (<i>PAH</i> gene) were relatively more prevalent, and these patients with CDSP had the most frequent c.1400C > G variant (p.S467C) and c.51C > G variant (p. F17L) in this study. In addition, statistical analysis revealed that the estimates of diagnostic yields varied across certain phenotypic features of patients, and patients with specific phenotypic traits tended to benefit more from CFES. The CFES may be a first-line genetic test for diagnosing young children with suspected genetic conditions, as it validates the identification of molecular genetics alterations and facilitates comprehensive medical management. Moreover, we found that infants exhibiting metabolism/homeostasis abnormalities, craniofacial /otolaryngology/ ophthalmologic abnormalities, and/or the integument were significantly more likely to receive a genetic diagnosis via CFES than infants without such features. However, due to the current study's low diagnostic yield and inherent limitations, high-quality clinical studies with larger sample sizes are still needed to provide more likely results and confirm our findings."

This study aimed to evaluate the frequency of ADHD in referred patients to PKU Clinic in Yazd, Iran. In this cross-sectional analytical study, all patients older than three years with PKU who were referred to the PKU Clinic of Shahid Sadoughi Hospital, Yazd, Iran, in 2018 were evaluated, and ADHD symptoms in them were assessed via parent face-to-face interview. The patients were diagnosed with ADHD if they scored at least of 20 on ADHD diagnostic rating scale via parent interview based on DSM-VI criteria. Fourteen boys and 21girls with a mean age of 9.55±1.8 years were evaluated. 51.5% of those diagnosed with PKU had ADHD. Accordingly, ADHD was more frequent in girls (77.8% vs. 41% in boys, P=0.03). The mean age of diagnosis of PKU was significantly higher in patients with ADHD (52.54±15.65 months vs. 29.75±9.65 months, P = 0.03). The mean of PA level in the last six months (15.59±5.95 vs. 8.72+5.18, P= 0.005) and mean of the last six PA levels (14.76±4.71 vs. 8.96±3.86, P= 0.03) were significantly higher in ADHD group. The prevalence of ADHD in phenylketonuria patients in the present study was much more than in other studies. Late diagnosis of PKU and long-term high PA blood and brain level might be associated with increased neonatal screening. Hence, regular follow-up and continuous evaluation of patients with PKU for ADHD symptoms should be performed."

Compared with other traditional models, gut-on-a-chip has many unique advantages, and thereby, it can be considered as a novel model for studying intestinal functions and diseases. Based on the chip design, we can replicate the in vivo microenvironment of the intestine and study the effects of individual variables on the experiment. In recent years, it has been used to study several diseases. To better mimic the intestinal microenvironment, the structure and function of gut-on-a-chip are constantly optimised and improved. Owing to the complexity of the disease mechanism, gut-on-a-chip can be used in conjunction with other organ chips. In this review, we summarise the human intestinal structure and function as well as the development and improvement of gut-on-a-chip. Finally, we present and discuss gut-on-a-chip applications in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), viral infections and phenylketonuria. Further improvement of the simulation and high throughput of gut-on-a-chip and realisation of personalised treatments are the problems that should be solved for gut-on-a-chip as a disease model."

We report a multicentre, open, longitudinal, prospective intervention study on a phenylalanine-free infant formula (PKU Start: Vitaflo International Ltd.). This was a 2-part study: part I (28 days short term evaluation) and part II (12 months extension). Data was collected on infant blood phenylalanine concentrations, dietary intake, growth, and gastrointestinal tolerance. Ten infants (n = 8 males, 80%), with a median age of 14 weeks (range 4-36 weeks) were recruited from 3 treatment centres in the UK. Nine of ten infants completed the 28-day follow-up (one caregiver preferred the usual phenylalanine-free formula and discontinued the study formula after day 14) and 7/9 participated in study part II. The phenylalanine-free infant formula contributed a median of 57% (IQR 50-62%) energy and 53% (IQR 33-66%) of total protein intake from baseline to the end of the part II extension study. During the 12-month follow-up, infants maintained normal growth and satisfactory blood phenylalanine control. Any early gastrointestinal symptoms (constipation, colic, vomiting and poor feeding) improved with time. The study formula was well tolerated, helped maintain good metabolic control, and normal growth in infants with PKU. The long-term efficacy of phenylalanine-free infant formula should continue to be observed and monitored."

    "abstract": "Hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA) is the most common amino acid metabolism defect in humans. It is an autosomal-recessive disorder of the phenylalanine (Phe) metabolism, in which high Phe concentrations and low tyrosine (Tyr) concentrations in the blood cause phenylketonuria (PKU), brain dysfunction, light pigmentation and musty odor. Newborn screening data of HPA have revealed that the prevalence varies worldwide, with an average of 1:10,000. Most cases of HPA result from phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) deficiency, while a small number of HPA are caused by defects in the tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) metabolism and DnaJ heat shock protein family (Hsp40) member C12 (DNAJC12) deficiency. Currently, the molecular pathophysiology of the neuropathology associated with HPA remains incompletely understood. Dietary restriction of Phe has been highly successful, although outcomes are still suboptimal and patients find it difficult to adhere to the treatment. Pharmacological treatments, such as BH4 and phenylalanine ammonia lyase, are available. Gene therapy for HPA is still in development."

    "abstract": "We aimed to evaluate the role of plasma phenylalanine (Phe) levels and its fluctuations in some neurocognitive domains and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings in adult patients with phenylketonuria (PKU). It was an observational study that included patients older than 18 years with early-treated classical PKU. Plasma Phe levels were measured every other month throughout 2 years and predictor variables were the mean, maximum (max), minimum (min), range (min-max), and plasma Phe levels at the time of cognitive testing. Patients were evaluated for executive function, processing speed, visual attention, and fluid cognitive abilities using the Trail Making Test (TMT) and for the presence of brain MRI abnormalities. In all, 22 patients with a mean age of 34 years were included, of which 18 (81%) were women. Patients with higher range and maximum Phe levels had a poorer time-based performance on TMT form A and form B. Patients with brain MRI abnormalities had higher range, maximum, and mean Phe levels. Range of Phe levels showed a good performance for MRI abnormalities (area under the curve (AUC): 0.881, standard error (SE): 0.095, 95% CI: 0.695-0.999, p = 0.044) and for the poorest time-based performances on TMT form A (AUC: 0.822, SE: 0.092, 95% CI: 0.641-0.999, p = 0.024) and B (AUC: 0.816, SE: 0.094, 95% CI: 0.632-0.999, p = 0.021). Greater Phe variability may have a negative impact on some neurocognitive domains and could be related to the severity of brain structural damage in adult patients with PKU."

    "abstract": "Hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA) is an autosomal recessive disorder that results from a deficiency in the phenylalanine hydroxylase enzyme (PAH) or from a flaw in the genes that are responsible for the biosynthesis or regeneration of the cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), including GCH1, SR, QDPR, PTS, and PCD. Identification of disease-causing variants in these genes can help physicians and clinical geneticists in differential diagnosis, appropriate prescription drugs, and saving time and cost. This study attempted to identify these genes' most prevalent disease-causing variants in Iranian HPA patients. This study was performed under the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Before it started, the flow work and inclusion/exclusion criteria were published as a protocol in PROSPERO (CRD42021273705). We conducted a comprehensive search on December 10, 2022, on international online databases, including Web of Science, Scopus, EMBASE, Science Direct, PubMed/Medline, Google Scholar, SID, ISC, and Magiran search engine, to find pertinent publications. Some studies were chosen based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. Altogether, 1,243 Iranian patients from 13 articles were considered. In total, we identified 129 distinct disease-causing variants in PAH (20 novel variants), 29 in QDPR (17 novel variants), 15 in PTS (seven novel variants), and one novel variant in PCD. Twenty disease-causing variants for PAH, 18 for QDPR, and 8 for PTS are included in the genes' proposed genetic diagnostic panels. These panels include more than 75% of the documented disease-causing variants in the Iranian population. The findings of this research illustrated the spectrum of disease-causing variants in the PAH, QDPR, PTS, and PCD genes identified in Iranian HPA patients. Common disease-causing variants of these genes may be chosen as a preliminary diagnostic panel for early diagnosis and lowering therapy costs."

This study aimed to evaluate the influence of metabolic control on classical CVR factors in adult patients with PKU. It was a cross-sectional study conducted in patients older than 18 years with a diagnosis of classical PKU and under strict dietary control. Demographic, epidemiological and laboratory variables related to CVR were collected. The variables of metabolic control were some parameters related to phenylalanine (Phe) plasma levels. A total of 47 patients were included with a mean age of 36±10 years of which 30 (64%) were women. Multivariate analysis revealed that range Phe (B=-2.211, P=0.044, 95%CI: -4.354-(-0.068)) levels were within the model for triglyceride concentrations, while minimum (B=-2.803, P=0.051, 95%CI: -5.612-0.007) and range (B=-1.515, P=0.039, 95%CI: -2.945-(-0.084)) Phe levels were within the model for high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations. Median Phe levels showed a stronger correlation with waist circumference (WC) (B=1.216, P=0.002, 95%CI: 0.462-1.969) than with body mass index (B=0.355, P=0.052, 95%CI: -0.004-0.714). High Phe levels and wide Phe fluctuations were related to weight gain, increased WC and lipid profile abnormalities. Systematic CVR assessments and comprehensive monitoring of Phe levels may be desirable to prevent or delay cardiovascular disease in PKU patients."

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria is a common inborn defect of amino acid metabolism in the world. This failure is caused by an autosomal recessive insufficiency of the hepatic enzyme hyperphenylalaninemia (PAH), which catalyzes the irreversible hydroxylation of phenylalanine to tyrosine. More than 1,040 different disease-causing mutations have already been identified in the PAH gene. The most prominent complication of Phenylketonuria, if not diagnosed and treated, is severe mental retardation. Hence, early diagnosis and initiation of nutritional therapy are the most significant measures in preventing this mental disorder. Given these data, we developed a simple and rapid molecular test to detect the most frequent PAH mutations. Multiplex assay was developed based on the SNaPshot minisequencing approach to simultaneously perform genotyping of the 10 mutations at the PAH gene. We optimized detection of these mutations in one multiplex PCR, followed by 10 single-nucleotide extension reactions. DNA sequencing assay was also used to verify genotyping results obtained by SNaPshot minisequencing. All 10 genotypes were determined based on the position and the fluorescent color of the peaks in a single electropherogram. Sequencing results of these frequent mutations showed that by using this method, a 100% detection rate could be achieved in the Iranian population. SNaPshot minisequencing can be useful as a secondary test in neonatal screening for HPA in neonates with a positive screening test, and it is also suitable for carrier screening. The assay can be easily applied for accurate and time- and cost-efficient genotyping of the selected SNPs in various population."

Their concentration levels are associated with a variety of diseases, such as phenylketonuria and colorectal cancer. Therefore, the quantification of aromatic amino acids is an important task. In the present work, a novel and rapid three-way analytical method was proposed to detect the levels of aromatic amino acids in prostate cancer cells (PC3 cells) and Dulbecco's modified minimal essential medium (DMEM cell culture), by using the affordable ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer. First, spectrum-pH second-order data were designed per sample; Second, properties of the resulted spectrum-pH-sample three-way data were investigated by utilizing the parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC), alternating trilinear decomposition (ATLD), and constrained alternating trilinear decomposition (CATLD) algorithms, and a flexible scanning approach for determining the constraint parameters of CATLD was proposed; Third, a three-way calibration method based on the CATLD algorithm with the proposed scanning approach was developed for interference-free quantification of aromatic amino acids in these systems. The average relative predictive errors of validation (ARPEV) for phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan were 1.4%, 3.0%, and 0.7% in prostate cancer cells, and ARPEV for phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan were 4.1%, 1.2%, and 0.7% in DMEM cell culture. The predicted contents of tyrosine and tryptophan in DMEM cell culture were 64.2 ± 2.9 μg mL<sup>-1</sup>, 5.6 ± 0.3 μg mL<sup>-1</sup>, there are no significant differences in the concentrations between the developed analytical method and high performance liquid chromatography method. The proposed spectrum-pH-sample three-way calibration method based on CATLD algorithm can provide an interesting analytical strategy with high selectivity and accuracy for ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer."

    "title": "The impact of metabolic control on cognition, neurophysiology, and well-being in PKU: A systematic review and meta-analysis of the within-participant literature.",
    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a metabolic disease where Phenylalanine (Phe) rises much above normal levels. Cross-sectional and correlational studies provide valuable information on the importance of maintaining low blood-Phe to achieve good outcomes, but they may be confounded, at least partially, by differences in participant demographics. Moreover, the effect of Phe at older ages is difficult to ascertain because of strong associations between Phe levels across ages. Within-participant studies avoid confounding issues. We have reviewed these studies. We followed PRISMA guidelines to search the literature for studies reporting the impact of Phe changes within participants. Phe was either increased or decreased through diet relaxation/resumption or through pharmacological interventions. Forty-six separate articles reported, singly or in combination, results on cognition (N = 37), well-being (N = 22) and neurophysiological health (N = 14). For all studies, we established, in a binary way, whether a benefit of lower Phe was or was not demonstrated and compared numbers showing benefit versus a null or negative outcome. We then analyzed whether critical parameters (e.g., length of the study/condition for the change, size of Phe change achieved) influenced presence or absence of benefit. For a subset of studies that reported quantitative cognitive outcomes, we carried out a meta-analysis to estimate the size of change in cognitive performance associated with a change in Phe and its significance. There were significantly more studies with benefits than no benefits, both for cognitive and well-being outcomes, and a trend in this direction for neurophysiological outcomes. The meta-analysis showed a highly significant effect size both overall (0.55) and when studies with adults/adolescents were considered separately (0.57). There was some indication that benefits were easier to demonstrate when differences in Phe were larger and achieved across a longer period, but these effects were not always consistent. These results reinforce results from the literature by demonstrating the importance of lower Phe in children as well as in adolescents and adults, even when confounding factors in group composition are eliminated. The field would benefit from further studies where Phe levels are contrasted within-participants to ascertain how much Phe needs to be changed and for how long to see a difference and which measures demonstrate a difference (e.g., which cognitive tasks)."

Then, the diagnostic values of the optimized Phe cut-off value were evaluated using validation set involving 30,452 neonates, based on the comparison of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) obtained from conventional cut-off value. A range of cut-off values was used for preliminary Phe concentrations in the two groups to analyze the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV. The optimized cut-off value of Phe in group 1 was 2.0, while that in the group 2 was 2.21. A comparison was given to PPV, NPV, sensitivity, and specificity generated by the optimized cut-off value and the conventional cut-off value, which yielded similar sensitivity, specificity, and PPV, and less recalled number of samples. The optimization of cut-off value of Phe based on sampling time is feasible for PKU screening in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. In addition, the false positive rate was significantly reduced, which may save more efforts in sample recalling process. · The optimization of Phe cut-off value for Xinjiang Region.. · The optimized cut-off value reduced the recalling samples.. · Our cut-off value is feasible for PKU screening in Xinjiang.."

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) and biotinidase deficiency (BD) are autosomal recessive diseases. If they are not identified and treated early, severe intellectual disability and developmental delay occur. This study was conducted to calculate the ten-year incidence of PKU and BD in the Diyarbakır province of Turkey. This cross-sectional study included patients born between 2011-2020 and diagnosed with PKU and BD. Patients with a clear diagnosis had their records evaluated retrospectively. Between 2011 and 2020, blood was taken from 417,525 newborns` heels in Diyarbakir province. As a result of further diagnostic testing, 53 PKU (Incidence: 1:7878) and 177 BD (Incidence: 1:2359) were detected. Of the patients with BD, 56% had profound BD and 44% had partial BD. The records of a total of 269 patients (PKU: 25; BD: 123; Hyperphenylalaninemia: 121) were examined. Parents of 65% (n=15) of the patients diagnosed with PKU and 46.6% (n=55) of the patients diagnosed with BD were consanguineous. The incidence of both PKU and BD was found to be high in our region. The high number of consanguineous marriages was regarded as the most important explanation for the high frequency of these illnesses."

    "abstract": "Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has been suggested as a second-tier diagnostic test for newborn screening, which could help identify the carrier status of hundreds monogenic disorders with wider spectrum and earlier stage. Among the 1087 children (age from 27 min to 14 years old) underwent liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), 290 individuals who had at least one abnormal value of LC-MS/MS measurements were sent for amplicon sequencing-based carrier screening (targeting 141 genes for 170 monogenic disorders). Multiplex polymerase chain reaction was used for amplicon capture and library preparation, the NextSeq 500 NGS platform (Illumina PE150) was used for sequencing. The identified clinical significant variants were further validated by Sanger sequencing. Only 89 children carry none of clinical significant variants, other 201 individuals carry 1-4 variants in 63 genes (132 types; 317 in total: 171 pathogenic, 37 likely pathogenic, 29 variants of unknown significance, and 80 disease-associated functional polymorphisms). Besides the three missing samples with 4 variants, 91.1 % of identified variants (285 variants in 54 genes) were completely validated by Sanger sequencing. The most common genetic variants were in UGT1A1, GJB2, PAH, G6PD, and SLC25A13 (top 5 genes), which corresponding to Gilbert/Crigler-Najjar symdrome (n = 89), autosomal recessive hearing loss type 1A (n = 58), phenylketonuria (n = 12), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenease deficiency (n = 11) and Citrin deficiency (n = 9). More than 42 children present higher phenylalanine in LC-MS/MS, but only 12 of them were identified to carry clinical significant variants in PAH gene. The amplicon sequencing-based carrier screening in our study could further clarify the abnormal LC-MS/MS results, which could also discover more monogenic disorders uncovered by LC-MS/MS screening."

    "abstract": "Amino acid disorders (AADs) are a large group of rare inherited conditions that collectively impact one in 6500 live births, often resulting in rapid neurological decline and death during infancy. For several AADs, including phenylketonuria, dietary modification prevents physiological deterioration and ameliorates symptoms. Despite this remarkable potential for treatment success, dietary therapy for most AADs remains largely unexplored. Although animal models have provided novel insights into AAD mechanisms, few have been used for therapeutic diet discovery. Here, we find that of all the animal models, Drosophila is particularly well suited for nutrigenomic disease modelling, having amino acid pathways conserved with humans, exceptional genetic tractability, and the unique availability of a synthetic customisable diet."

    "abstract": "In the UK, different dietary systems are used to calculate protein or tyrosine/phenylalanine intake in the dietary management of hereditary tyrosinaemia, HTI, II and III (HT), with no systematic evidence comparing the merits and inadequacies of each. This study aimed to examine the current UK dietary practices in all HTs and, using Delphi methodology, to reach consensus agreement about the best dietary management system. Over 12 months, five meetings were held with UK paediatric and adult dietitians working in inherited metabolic disorders (IMDs) managing HTs. Eleven statements on the dietary system for calculating protein or tyrosine/phenylalanine intake were discussed. Dietitians from 12 of 14 IMD centres caring for HT patients participated, and 7/11 statements were agreed with one Delphi round. Nine centres (three abstentions) supported a 1 g protein exchange system for all foods except fruit and vegetables. The same definitions used in the UK for phenylketonuria (PKU) were adopted to define when to calculate foods as part of a protein exchange system or permit them without measurement. Fruit and vegetables contain a lower amount of tyrosine/phenylalanine per 1 g of protein than animal and cereal foods. The correlation of tyrosine vs. phenylalanine (mg/100 g) for vegetables and fruits was high (r = 0.9). In Delphi round 2, agreement was reached to use the tyrosine/phenylalanine analyses of fruits/vegetables, for their allocation within the HT diet. This allowed larger portion sizes of measured fruits and vegetables and increased the variety of fruit and vegetables that could be eaten without measurement. In HTs, a combined dietary management system will be used: 1 g protein exchanges for cereal and milk protein sources and tyrosine/phenylalanine exchanges for fruit and vegetables. Intensive, systematic communication with IMD dietitians and reappraisal of the evidence has redefined and harmonised HT dietary practice across the UK."

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an inherited metabolic disease characterized by a defective conversion of phenylalanine (Phe) to tyrosine, potentially leading to Phe accumulation in the brain. Dietary restriction since birth has led to normal cognitive development. However, PKU patients can still develop cognitive or behavioral abnormalities and subtle neurological deficits. Despite the increasing evidence in the field, the assessment of neurocognitive, psychopathological, and neurological follow-up of PKU patients at different ages is still debated. The high interindividual variability in the cognitive outcome of PKU patients makes the specificity of the neurocognitive and behavioral assessment extremely challenging. In the present paper, a multidisciplinary panel of Italian PKU experts discussed different tools available for cognitive, psychopathological, and neurological assessment at different ages based on the existing literature and daily clinical practice. This study aims to provide evidence and a real-life-based framework for a specific clinical assessment of pediatric, adolescent, and adult patients affected by PKU."

    "abstract": "Hyperphenylalaninemias (HPA) are due to several gene mutations, of which the PAH gene is the most frequently involved. Prevalence and incidence of disease vary between populations, with genotype/phenotype correlations not always capable to correctly predict disease severity. The aim of this study was to give an overview of PAH mutations among one of the largest cohort of patients among Europe, born in Lombardy (Italy) starting from late 1970 s and including over a 60 years of activity; furthermore, to evaluate and discuss identified genotype/phenotype correlations and related reliability. Eight hundred and twenty-six HPA patients in current follow-up at the San Paolo Hospital in Milan (Italy) were retrospectively reviewed, including molecular results and allelic phenotype and genotype values (attributed on the basis of the APV/GPV system) to verify genotype-phenotype correlations. A total of 166 different PAH variants were reviewed; of those, seven variants were identified as not previously described in literature. Most frequently reported variant was p.Ala403Val, followed by p.Arg261Gln, p.Val245Ala, IVS10-11 g>a, p.Tyr414Cys and p.Leu48Ser. Phenotype prediction, based on APV/GPV, matched the actual phenotype in most cases, but not always. The cohort of patients included in this study constitute a representative sample of the HPA population worldwide. Studies on this sample may allow to improve clinical and genetic evaluation performances for affected patients, consequently to develop personalized medicine interventions and provide more precise indications on the correct treatment approach based on the accumulated evidence, also in light of a prognostically reliable but not always conclusive APV/GPV system."

Six individuals (aged 6 to 15) with untreated HPA were compared with six age and gender matches with PKU, and six healthy controls on the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, 5th edition; Wechsler Individual Achievement Test, 2nd edition; Trail-Making test; Contingency Naming Test; and Oral Fluency test. Self- and parent-report rating scales administered included the Conners Comprehensive Behavior Rating Scales; Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function, 2nd edition; the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory, and the Phenylketonuria Quality of Life (PKU group only) questionnaires. Early treated PKU participants demonstrated normal intelligence, pointing to the efficacy of dietary management. Quality of life and behavioural difficulties were observed including more severe externalising problems. HPA participants showed normal ability, including executive ability. Power was limited by the small sample. This was the first study of the New Zealand population with HPA. While there was insufficient evidence to warrant treatment, there was also insufficient evidence to safely exclude the presence of cognitive impairment."

    "abstract": "Charles Scriver is a towering figure in the medical genetics community. At 92 he can look back upon a remarkable career that established the field of biochemical genetics, a subsection of medical genetics that is translating the developments in basic genetics into the diagnoses and treatments of inherited biochemical diseases. This biographical sketch summarizes the key achievements of Dr. Scriver in research and medicine, integrating the different components of medical genetics into comprehensive provincial programs, teaching a generation of physicians and researchers, and developing worldwide collaborations. Charles has been a mighty figure in so many ways. He began his career by bringing amino acid chromatography from London to North America, thereby greatly enlarging the scope of metabolic disorders. Subsequently, his editorship of the classic Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease brought metabolism into genetics and established the field of biochemical genetics. He discovered a number of new diseases and was the first to recognize shared mediated amino acid transporters in the kidney, a medical breakthrough that has become a basic concept of amino acid homeostasis. He led the formation of the Quebec Network of Genetic Medicine, incorporating screening, diagnosis, counseling, treatment and research of genetic diseases, which to this day serves as a model for collaborative and comprehensive medical genetic programs internationally. He initiated the development of sapropterin (Kuvan®), the first non-dietary treatment for phenylketonuria (PKU) and helped identify the mechanism of this cofactor's action on phenylalanine hydroxylase in variants of PKU. His laboratory also led the development of phenylalanine ammonia lyase (Palynziq®), an enzyme substitution therapy that now serves as an alternative to dietary treatment for PKU. The ecosystem that Charles generated at the deBelle laboratory was collegial and highly fruitful. With the input and support of his remarkable wife Zipper, he found a way to integrate the concept of family into his work environment. Bustling with an endless series of evolving activities, he generated an inclusive setting which drew on the talents of brilliant clinical and research staff, as well as the input of patients and their families. In all these efforts, Charles managed to answer his own musings summarized in the following three questions: Who do we serve? How do we serve? Why do we serve? Charles Scriver's life is one well lived. An extraordinary physician scientist whose accomplishments are cause for pause and wonder; generating volumes of contribution which will forever seem impossible for one individual to deliver."

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is the most prevalent inborn error of amino acid metabolism, necessitating patients to strictly restrict dietary phenylalanine. As this can be a confusing and concerning diagnosis, patients and loved ones will likely be drawn to learn more. A critical factor for citizens to harness the health-related digital information is to ensure that it is easy to read. This study assessed the readability of 100 digital articles related to PKU and explored the effect of the source of online information on the readability of these articles. For each article, 5 readability tests were conducted using on-line readability software. From the 100 assessed websites, 34% were commercially sourced. Of the remaining 66 sites, 40% had.org and 17% had.gov extensions. All 5 tests confirm that a large majority of the sample was written at an unacceptable reading level. In fact, over two-thirds of the sample received a readability score within the difficult range for three of the tests, while the remaining two deemed 49% and 45% of the sample as difficult to read, respectively. Commercially sourced websites were deemed to be more difficult to read than the other sites with respect to the two of the five measures. Despite the large amount of PKU information online, most of it may be incomprehensible to the average person and thus miss the mark in helping patients and caregivers manage their condition. Opportunities exist for authors of digital health promotional information to effectively achieve their goal by using comprehensible, easy-to-read language."

    "abstract": "Introduction: There is little practical guidance about suitable food choices for higher natural protein tolerances in patients with phenylketonuria (PKU). This is particularly important to consider with the introduction of adjunct pharmaceutical treatments that may improve protein tolerance. Aim: To develop a set of guidelines for the introduction of higher protein foods into the diets of patients with PKU who tolerate >10 g/day of protein. Methods: In January 2022, a 26-item food group questionnaire, listing a range of foods containing protein from 5 to >20 g/100 g, was sent to all British Inherited Metabolic Disease Group (BIMDG) dietitians (n = 80; 26 Inherited Metabolic Disease [IMD] centres). They were asked to consider within their IMD dietetic team when they would recommend introducing each of the 26 protein-containing food groups into a patient’s diet who tolerated >10 g to 60 g/day of protein. The patient protein tolerance for each food group that received the majority vote from IMD dietetic teams was chosen as its tolerance threshold for introduction. A virtual meeting was held using Delphi methodology in March 2022 to discuss and agree final consensus. Results: Responses were received from dietitians from 22/26 IMD centres (85%) (11 paediatric, 11 adult). For patients tolerating protein ≥15 g/day, the following foods were agreed for inclusion: gluten-free pastas, gluten-free flours, regular bread, cheese spreads, soft cheese, and lentils in brine; for protein tolerance ≥20 g/day: nuts, hard cheeses, regular flours, meat/fish, and plant-based alternative products (containing 5−10 g/100 g protein), regular pasta, seeds, eggs, dried legumes, and yeast extract spreads were added; for protein tolerance ≥30 g/day: meat/fish and plant-based alternative products (containing >10−20 g/100 g protein) were added; and for protein tolerance ≥40 g/day: meat/fish and plant-based alternatives (containing >20 g/100 g protein) were added. Conclusion: This UK consensus by IMD dietitians from 22 UK centres describes for the first time the suitability and allocation of higher protein foods according to individual patient protein tolerance. It provides valuable guidance for health professionals to enable them to standardize practice and give rational advice to patients."

    "abstract": "To evaluate the long-term costs and health effects of the Swedish newborn screening program for classic phenylketonuria (PKU) alone and in combination with congenital hypothyroidism compared with no screening. A decision-analytic model was developed to estimate and compare the long-term (80 years) costs and health effects of newborn screening for PKU and congenital hypothyroidism. Data were obtained from the literature and translated to Swedish conditions. A societal perspective was taken, including costs falling on health care providers, municipal care and services, as well as production loss due to morbidity. Screening 100 000 newborns for PKU resulted in 73 gained quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) compared with no screening. When adding congenital hypothyroidism, the number of gained QALYs was 232 compared with PKU alone, adding up to a total of 305 QALYs gained. Corresponding cost estimates were $80.8, $70.3, and $10.05 million USD for no screening, PKU screening, and PKU plus congenital hypothyroidism screening, respectively, indicating that screening for PKU plus congenital hypothyroidism was more effective and less costly compared with the other strategies. The majority of cost savings with PKU plus congenital hypothyroidism screening was due to reductions in productivity losses and municipal care and services costs. The Swedish newborn screening program for PKU and congenital hypothyroidism saves substantial costs for society while generating additional QALYs, emphasizing the importance of public investments in early diagnosis and treatment."

Nevertheless, there is still controversy regarding their safety, especially when administered over the long term, taking into account that most of the safety studies are based on animal models and only a few human studies. This review focuses on low-calorie protein/peptide sweeteners. These include artificial sweeteners, i.e. aspartame, advantame, neotame, and alitame which are synthetic, versus those of natural origin such as thaumatin, monellin, brazzein, pentadin, mabinlin, curculin, and egg white lysozyme. We conducted a systematic literature survey to ensure the accuracy of the data regarding the chemical properties, synthesis, and industrial applications.

    "abstract": "Rare genetic disorders affect as many as 3%-5% of all babies born. Approximately 10,000 such disorders have been identified or hypothesized to exist. Treatment is supportive except in a limited number of instances where specific therapies exist. Development of new therapies has been hampered by at least two major factors: difficulty in diagnosing diseases early enough to enable treatment before irreversible damage occurs, and the high cost of developing new drugs and getting them approved by regulatory agencies. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) techniques have become exponentially less expensive and more rapid since the beginning of the human genome project, such that return of clinical data can now be achieved in days rather than years and at a cost that is comparable to other less expansive genetic testing. Thus, it is likely that WGS will ultimately become a mainstream, first-tier NBS technique at least for those disorders without appropriate high-throughput functional tests. However, there are likely to be several steps in the evolution to this end. The clinical implications of these advances are profound but highlight the bottlenecks in drug development that still limit transition to treatments. This article summarizes discussions arising from a recent National Institute of Health conference on nucleic acid therapy, with a focus on the impact of WGS in the identification of diagnosis and treatment of rare genetic disorders."

No pegvaliase activity was detected in pumped breast milk samples prior to reinstituting pegvaliase, and at doses of 80, 110 and 140 mg/week during lactation. The phenylalanine content of breast milk samples collected during pegvaliase therapy were not significantly different than controls, and the infant has grown and developed normally, indicating that pegvaliase therapy during lactation is safe."

Defective PAH activity ultimately leads to increased phenylalanine (Phe) blood concentrations (hyperphenylalaninemia) that harm the brain. The primary purpose of PKU treatment is to maintain the blood Phe level to prevent certain undesired effects. Hence, lifelong medical nutrition therapy is recommended for these patients. The usefulness of natural protein sources may be limited, as they are based on individual Phe tolerance, and a patient's daily protein requirements are supported by Phe-free amino acid mixtures. A few PKU treatment centers recently started using supplemental casein glycomacropeptide, pegvaliase, or large neutral amino acids, and some patients are treated by responding to tetrahydrobiopterin, which works as a pharmaceutical chaperone (prescribed as sapropterin dihydrochloride). This review discusses the efficacy and safety considerations of basic medical nutrition approaches and newgeneration protein substitutes that are used to treat PKU."

Biochemical markers such as vitamin B12, folic acid, iron, ferritin, calcium, 25-hydroxy vitamin D3, zinc, plasma phenylalanine (Phe) and tyrosine (Tyr) levels in blood were evaluated, as well as demographics and anthropometric measurements. A three-day dietary recall questionnaire was completed by all individuals. 80% (64) of the 80 patients (42 females, 52.5%) had typical PKU. Consanguineous marriages were found in 57.5% (46) of the patients' parents. According to the height for age index, 17.5% of the study group (n = 14) were short or very short. According to age-related weight and body mass index (BMI), 37.5% (n = 30) and 43.8% (n = 35) of people are obese or overweight, respectively. Biochemical tests revealed increased vitamin B12 levels and 25-hydroxy vitamin D3 deficiency in 35% (n = 28) of the patients, insufficient folic acid in 12.5% (n = 10), and elevated phenylalanine levels in 70.3% (n = 45) of children under 12 years old, and adolescents 62.5% (n = 10). A high Phe intake (OR = 4.44, CI %95 = 1.27-15.57) is a risk factor for obesity and overweight. Patients with PKU had a high rate of overweight and obesity. PKU patients who are overweight or obese do not differ from normal-weight patients in terms of dietary intake or laboratory findings (except for serum iron levels). One-third of patients with phenylketonuria were vitamin D deficient and had a BMI/A index of overweight/obese. It is recommended to use special medical food to help solve energy and nutrient deficiencies."

This study aims to identify disease-causing variants in HPA patients, which may be helpful in genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis. A total of 10 HPA patients were enrolled in this study. The coding and adjacent intronic regions of PTS and QDPR genes were examined using Sanger sequencing. Protein modeling was also performed for novel identified variants. Ten patients and a total of 20 alleles were studied, which led to the identification of 10 different variants. All variants identified in PTS and QDPR were missense, except for the c.383_407del variant in the QDPR. Also, three novel variants were identified in the QDPR, including c.79G>T, c.383_407del and c.488G>A, and a novel variant, c.65C>G, in the PTS. Despite the genetic similarities in the disease-causing variants, differences were observed in the Asian and European populations with our populations; As a result, similar but more extensive studies are needed to investigate the distribution of disease-causing variants in genes involved in non-PKU hyperphenylalaninemia."

While HTV corrects metabolic liver defects such as phenylketonuria or cystathionine β-synthase deficiency, correction of <i>spf</i> <sup><i>ash</i></sup> mice with ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency was not possible despite overexpression in the liver, as the OTC enzyme is primarily expressed in periportal hepatocytes. To target periportal hepatocytes, we established hydrodynamic retrograde intrabiliary injection (HRII) in mice and optimized minicircle (MC) vector delivery using luciferase as a marker gene. HRII resulted in a transfection efficiency below 1%, 100-fold lower than HTV. While HRII induced minimal liver toxicity compared with HTV, overexpression of luciferase by both methods, but not of a natural liver-specific enzyme, elicited an immune response that led to the elimination of luciferase expression. Further testing of MC vectors delivered via HRII in <i>spf</i> <sup><i>ash</i></sup> mice did not result in sufficient therapeutic efficacy and needs further optimization and/or selection of the corrected cells. This study reveals that luciferase expression is toxic for the liver. Furthermore, physical delivery of MC vectors via the bile duct has the potential to treat defects restricted to periportal hepatocytes, which opens new doors for non-viral liver-directed gene therapy."

    "abstract": "We propose encapsulating phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL)-bovine serum albumin (BSA) mixtures as potential oral therapy for the management of phenylketonuria. PAL will metabolize phenylalanine in the gastrointestinal tract while BSA will minimize product inhibition and allow PAL to work at its V<sub>max</sub>. We intend manufacturing microcapsules using spray drying and the proteins will be exposed to heat. In the current pre-formulation studies, we determined the effect of elevated temperatures on the structure and activity of PAL-BSA mixtures and evaluated the stabilizing potential of excipients. Exposure of PAL to 75°C decreased its V<sub>max</sub>. BSA exacerbated the elevated temperature-mediated decrease in PAL V<sub>max</sub> and completely lost the ability to protect PAL from trans cinnamic acid (TCA)-mediated product inhibition. Circular dichroism studies revealed that elevated temperatures did not affect the secondary structure of PAL but decreased BSA α-helicity. Binding experiments showed that elevated temperature-mediated loss in BSA α-helicity was associated with markedly decreased binding and sequestration of TCA, which accounts for the inability of BSA to relieve PAL product inhibition. Sucrose, trehalose, and low concentrations of sodium dodecyl sulfate conferred concentration dependent stabilization of BSA secondary structure against thermal denaturation. The sugars enhanced PAL V<sub>max</sub>, markedly improved TCA binding to BSA, and restored the ability of BSA to relieve PAL product inhibition. PAL-BSA mixtures exposed to elevated temperatures in the presence of sucrose and trehalose exhibited high and constant PAL activity. The results justify inclusion of these sugars in the eventual microcapsule manufacturing process."

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a rare congenital disorder caused by decreased metabolism of phenylalanine determining cerebral impairments. If untreated, PKU might lead to intellectual disability, seizures and behavioral disorders. The aim of this study is to provide a characterization of the psychopathological profile of a pediatric population diagnosed with PKU at newborn screening. an accurate neuropsychological evaluation of 23 patients (aged 8-18 years) with hyperphenylalaninemia (defined as experimental group, EG) and in 23 age-matched healthy controls (defined as control group, CG) was performed using the Child and Adolescent Behavior Inventory (CABI) and Self-Administrated Psychiatric Scales for Children and Adolescents (SAFA) questionnaires. the CABI test showed significant differences for the sub-scales related to \"Irritable mood\", \"Oppositional-provocative symptoms\" and \"ADHD\" in the EG compared to CG (<i>p</i> = 0.014, <i>p</i> = 0.032, and <i>p</i> = 0.032, respectively). Patients with hyperphenylalaninemia also presented with significant differences both for anxiety disorder scale and depression scale of SAFA test than controls (<i>p</i> = 0.018 and <i>p</i> = 0.009, respectively). children and adolescents with early diagnosis of PKU showed a psychopathological risk profile characterized by an increased risk of experiencing symptoms such as mood deflection, anxiety, attention deficit, oppositional defiant behavior, and obsessive traits than healthy peers. Our findings highlighted the need of the inclusion of a neuropsychiatric evaluation in the management of these patients to improve their overall quality of life."

    "title": "Adsorption of Phenylalanine from Aqueous Solutions Using Activated Carbon from Sunflower Meal Functionalized with Sulfonic Groups.",
    "abstract": "The present work proposes the use of an agro-industrial residue from the sunflower crop as a feedstock to produce a low-cost adsorbent with a chemically modified surface bearing sulfonic groups. This modified low-cost adsorbent can be used for the removal of phenylalanine, and can also be applied in the process of obtaining a source of protein supplementation for patients with phenylketonuria. The functionalization of the adsorbent with sulfonic groups was adapted and presented advantages in terms of execution time, energy expenditure, number of reagents used and adsorbed amino acids. The produced adsorbent presented a surface area of 317.31 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup> with a predominance of micro- and mesopores, that influenced an approximate 30-fold reduction in adsorption equilibrium time. The optimization results indicated a higher adsorption capacity (39.64 mg g<sup>-1</sup>) in pH = 4; temperature of 25 °C and adsorbent dosage of 10 g L<sup>-1</sup>. The FTIR analyzes and the qualitative analysis of the elements present in the samples by EDS confirmed the introduction of sulfonic groups in the MPS500 coal. This work contributed to the understanding behind the adsorption of L-phenylalanine on charcoal surfaces functionalized with sulfonic groups, showing that they can be more selective for the adsorption of phenylalanine in a competitive system."

    "abstract": "Inherited metabolic disorders (IMD) are a group of hereditary diseases wherein the impairment of a biochemical pathway is intrinsic to the pathophysiology of the disease. Estonia's small population and nationwide digitalised healthcare system make it possible to perform an epidemiological study that covers the whole population. A study was performed in Tartu University Hospital, which is the only tertiary care unit in Estonia for diagnosing patients with IMD, to define the prevalence and live birth prevalence of IMDs and the effectiveness of new diagnostic methods on the diagnosis of IMD. During the retrospective study period from 1990 to 2017, 333 patients were diagnosed with IMD. Statistical analysis showed a significant increase in IMD diagnoses per year from 0.47 to 2.51 cases per 100 000 persons (<i>p</i> < 0.0001) during the study period. Live birth prevalence of IMD in Estonia was calculated to be 41.52 cases per 100 000 live births. The most frequently diagnosed IMD groups were disorders of amino acid metabolism, disorders of complex molecule degradation, mitochondrial disorders, and disorders of tetrapyrrole metabolism. Phenylketonuria was the most frequently diagnosed disorder of all IMD (21.6%). Our results correlated well with data from other developed countries and, along with high birth prevalence, add confidence in the effectiveness of our diagnostic yield. Implementation of new diagnostic methods during study period may largely account for the significant increase in the number of IMD diagnoses per year. We conclude that the implementation of new diagnostic methods continues to be important and contributes to better diagnosis of rare diseases."

    "abstract": "Orthostatic tremor (OT) is a type of postural tremor of the lower extremities that has not been described in either phenylketonuria (PKU) or hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA). Because little is known about the clinical features and therapeutic responses of OT in mild HPA, we describe a mild HPA patient who presented with OT as an initial symptom. A 22-year-old male was admitted for bilateral leg tremor while standing, with symptom onset eight months prior. One month before admission, the tremor disappeared in the left leg but persisted in the right leg. Electromyography recorded from the right gastrocnemius revealed a 6-8 Hz tremor, which appeared when the patient was standing and disappeared when he was resting or walking. Blood screening showed a phenylalanine/tyrosine ratio of 2.06 and a phenylalanine level of 140 μmol/L. Urine metabolic screening was negative. Whole-exome sequencing confirmed the presence of a compound heterozygous mutation, c.158G > A and c.728G > A, in phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene. After three months of levodopa/benserazide tablets (250 mg, tid) and a low-phenylalanine diet treatment, the tremor disappeared. Young-onset mild HPA is a relatively rare autosomal recessive metabolic disease, and slow OT is a rare clinical feature. Metabolic screening and genetic testing are the keys to early diagnosis and treatment. For adolescents and young adults, appropriate medication and long-term dietary therapy remain important treatments. This case expanded the disease spectrum of slow OT."

Predicted effects on protein structure caused by missense variants were assessed by <i>in silico</i> protein modeling. <b>Results and discussion:</b> A high prevalence of BH4D was noted in our HPA cohort (9.8%, N = 14/142). Clinically relevant biallelic genotypes were identified in the <i>PTS</i> (N = 7/14 patients), <i>QDPR</i> (N = 6/14 patients), and <i>PCBD1</i> (N = 1/14 patients) genes. Four novel <i>QDPR</i> variants [c.714dup or p.(Leu239Thrfs*44), c.106-1G>T or p.(?), c.214G>T or p.(Gly72*), and c.187_189dup or p.(Gln63dup)] were identified. <i>In silico</i> protein modeling of six missense variants of <i>PTS</i> [p.(Thr67Met), p.(Glu81Ala), and p.(Tyr113Cys)], <i>QDPR</i> [p.(Cys161Phe) and p.(Pro172Leu)], and <i>PCBD1</i> [p.(Glu97Lys)] supports their pathogenicity. Progressive neurological symptoms (mainly intellectual and motor impairment and even death in three patients) were noted in all patients with biallelic <i>QDPR</i> genotypes and in 5/7 patients bearing biallelic <i>PTS</i> genotypes. The single homozygous <i>PCBD1</i> p.(Glu97Lys) patient remains asymptomatic. <b>Conclusion:</b> A higher proportion of BH4D (9.8 vs. 1%-2% worldwide), attributable to a heterogeneous mutational spectrum and wide clinical presentation, was noted in our Mexican HPA cohort, with the <i>PTS</i>-related HPA disorder being the most frequent. Sequencing-based assays could be a reliable approach for diagnosing BH4D in our population."

We assessed the parental experiences in transitioning from a second stage to third stage liquid or powdered protein substitute in patients with PKU. Sixteen interviews (23 open-ended questions) were carried out with parents/caregivers of children with PKU (8 females, 50%) with a median age of 8 years (range 5-11 years), continuously treated with diet, and on a third stage protein substitute. Parents/caregivers identified common facilitators and barriers during the third stage protein substitute transition process. The main facilitators were: child and parent motivation, parent knowledge of the transition process, a role model with PKU, low volume and easy preparation of the third stage protein substitute (liquid/powder), anticipation of increasing child independence, lower parent workload, attractive packaging, better taste and smell, school and teacher support, dietetic plans and guidance, PKU social events, child educational materials and written resources. The main barriers were child aversion to new protein substitutes, poor child behaviour, child aged &gt; 5 years, parental fear of change, the necessity for parental time and persistence, loss of parental control, high product volume, different taste, smell, and texture of new protein substitutes, and peer bullying. A stepwise, supportive approach is necessary when transitioning from second to third stage protein substitutes in PKU. Future studies are needed to develop guidance to assist parents/caregivers, health professionals, and teachers during the transition process."

    "abstract": "Fruits and vegetables containing phenylalanine ≤ 75 mg/100 g (except potatoes) have little impact on blood phenylalanine in phenylketonuria (PKU). In a randomized, controlled, crossover intervention trial, we examined the effect of increasing phenylalanine intake from fruits and vegetables, containing phenylalanine 76−100 mg /100 g, compared with milk protein sources on blood phenylalanine control. This was a five-phase study (4 weeks each phase). In Phase A, patients remained on their usual diet and then were randomly allocated to start Phase B and C (an additional phenylalanine intake of 50 mg/day, then 100 mg from fruits and vegetables containing phenylalanine 76−100 mg/100 g) or Phase D and E (an additional phenylalanine intake of 50 mg/day then 100 mg/day from milk sources). There was a 7-day washout with the usual phenylalanine-restricted diet between Phase B/C and D/E. Blood phenylalanine was measured on the last 3 days of each week. If four out of six consecutive blood phenylalanine levels were >360 μmol/L in one arm, this intervention was stopped. Sixteen patients (median age 10.5 y; range 6−12 y) were recruited. At baseline, a median of 6 g/day (range: 3−25) natural protein and 60 g/day (range: 60−80) protein equivalent from protein substitute were prescribed. Median phenylalanine levels were: Phase A—240 μmol/L; Phase B—260 μmol/L; Phase C—280 μmol/L; Phase D—270 μmol/L and Phase E—280 μmol/L. All patients tolerated an extra 50 mg/day of phenylalanine from fruit and vegetables, containing phenylalanine 76−100 mg/100 g, but only 11/16 (69%) tolerated an additional 100 mg /day. With milk protein, only 8/16 (50%) tolerated an extra 50 mg/day and only 5/16 (31%) tolerated an additional 100 mg/day of phenylalanine. Tolerance was defined as maintaining consistent blood phenylalanine levels < 360 μmol/L throughout each study arm. There was a trend that vegetable protein had less impact on blood phenylalanine control than milk protein, but overall, the differences were not statistically significant (p = 0.152). This evidence supports the PKU European Guidelines cutoff that fruit and vegetables containing 76−100 mg phenylalanine/100 g should be calculated as part of the phenylalanine exchange system. Tolerance of the ‘free use’ of these fruits and vegetables depends on inter-patient variability but cannot be recommended for all patients with PKU."

    "abstract": "Metabolomic analyses in alkaptonuria (AKU) have recently revealed alternative pathways in phenylalanine-tyrosine (phe-tyr) metabolism from biotransformation of homogentisic acid (HGA), the active molecule in this disease. The aim of this research was to study the phe-tyr metabolic pathway and whether the metabolites upstream of HGA, increased in nitisinone-treated patients, also undergo phase 1 and 2 biotransformation reactions. Metabolomic analyses were performed on serum and urine from patients partaking in the SONIA 2 phase 3 international randomised-controlled trial of nitisinone in AKU (EudraCT no. 2013-001633-41). Serum and urine samples were taken from the same patients at baseline (pre-nitisinone) then at 24 and 48 months on nitisinone treatment (patients N = 47 serum; 53 urine) or no treatment (patients N = 45 serum; 50 urine). Targeted feature extraction was performed to specifically mine data for the entire complement of theoretically predicted phase 1 and 2 biotransformation products derived from phenylalanine, tyrosine, 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid and 4-hydroxyphenyllactic acid, in addition to phenylalanine-derived metabolites with known increases in phenylketonuria. In total, we observed 13 phase 1 and 2 biotransformation products from phenylalanine through to HGA. Each of these products were observed in urine and two were detected in serum. The derivatives of the metabolites upstream of HGA were markedly increased in urine of nitisinone-treated patients (fold change 1.2-16.2) and increases in 12 of these compounds were directly proportional to the degree of nitisinone-induced hypertyrosinaemia (correlation coefficient with serum tyrosine = 0.2-0.7). Increases in the urinary phenylalanine metabolites were also observed across consecutive visits in the treated group. Nitisinone treatment results in marked increases in a wider network of phe-tyr metabolites than shown before. This network comprises alternative biotransformation products from the major metabolites of this pathway, produced by reactions including hydration (phase 1) and bioconjugation (phase 2) of acetyl, methyl, acetylcysteine, glucuronide, glycine and sulfate groups. We propose that these alternative routes of phe-tyr metabolism, predominantly in urine, minimise tyrosinaemia as well as phenylalanaemia."

    "abstract": "Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) is a vital coenzyme for several enzymes involved in diverse enzymatic reactions in animals, and BH4 deficiency can lead to metabolic and neurological disorders due to dysfunction in its metabolism. In the silkworm natural homozygous mutant <i>lem<sup>l</sup></i>, the key enzyme sepiapterin reductase (BmSPR) in the de novo synthesis pathway of BH4 is inactivated, resulting in severe deficiency of BH4 synthesis. However, it is not known why the <i>lem<sup>l</sup></i> larvae can survive to the second-instar stage and which pathways lead to their death when BH4 is deficient. Here, we quantified BH4 and found that the fertilized eggs contained large amounts of BH4 transferred from the mother to the offspring, maintaining its normal development in the embryo and the first instar. Subsequently, we investigated the multiple pathways in which BH4 is involved as a cofactor. The results showed that BH4 deficiency in silkworms blocked the melanin synthesis pathway, caused an insufficient degree of epidermal sclerosis, disordered tyrosine metabolism, and damaged mitochondria. On the other hand, BH4 deficiency led to the uncoupling of nitric oxide synthase (BmNOS), a reduced NO production, and a significantly reduced fat in fat body catalyzation by phospholipase A2, resulting in an impaired immune system. Meanwhile, the uncoupling of BmNOS increased the O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> content, damaged the DNA, and caused the apoptosis of the body cells. Taken together, BH4 is critical for the life and death of <i>lem<sup>l</sup></i> mutants. This study lays a foundation for the further exploration of lepidopteran insects and provides an important basis for the treatment of human BH4 deficiency-related diseases."

    "abstract": "Studying rare diseases, particularly those with neurological dysfunction, is a challenge to researchers and healthcare professionals due to their complexity and small population with geographical dispersion. Universal and standardized biomarkers generated by tools such as functional neuroimaging have been forged to collect baseline data as well as treatment effects. However, the cost and heavily infrastructural requirement of those technologies have substantially limited their availability. Thus, developing non-invasive, portable, and inexpensive modalities has become a major focus for both researchers and clinicians. When considering neurological disorders and diseases with executive dysfunction, EEG is the most convenient tool to obtain biomarkers which can correlate the objective severity and clinical observation of these conditions. However, studies have also shown that EEG biomarkers and clinical observations alone are not sensitive enough since not all the patients present classical phenotypical features or EEG evidence of dysfunction. This article reviews disorders, including two rare disorders with neurological dysfunction and the usefulness of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) as a non-invasive optical modality to obtain hemodynamic biomarkers of diseases and for screening and monitoring the disease."

Significance was assessed using measures nested within independent PKU groups as a random factor. The weighted Glass' ∆ was - 0.44 for all functions taken together, and - 0.60 for IQ, both highly significant. Separate, significant impairments were found for most functions, but with great variability (ESs from -1.02 to -0.18). The most severe impairments were in reasoning, visual-spatial attention speed, sustained attention, visuo-motor control, and flexibility. Effect sizes were larger with speed than accuracy measures, and with visuo-spatial than verbal stimuli. Results show a specific PKU profile that needs consideration when monitoring the disease."

Affected patients encounter severe developmental delay, neurological deficits, and behavioral abnormalities when not treated. Early diagnosis and treatment are extremely important; newborn screening programs have been implemented in most countries to ensure early identification of patients with PKU. Despite available treatment options, several challenges remain: life-long adherence to a strict diet, approval of some medications for adults only, and lack of response to these therapies in a subpopulation of patients. Therefore, there is an urgent need for treatment alternatives. An mRNA-based approach tested in PKU mice showed a fast reduction in the accumulation of Phe in serum, liver and brain, the most significant organ affected. Repeated injections of LNP-formulated mouse PAH mRNA rescued PKU mice from the disease phenotype for a prolonged period of time. An mRNA-based approach could improve the quality of life tremendously in PKU patients of all ages by replacing standard-of-care treatments."

The majority of 92% (n = 1913) of PAA profiles out of the total 2081 tests run were non-diagnostic; the PAA values were within the age-specific RI. The PAA median was in close comparison close to the 50th percentile of reference data available in CLIR software. Out of the total 2081 tests run, one hundred and sixty-eight had abnormal PAA levels; 27.38% were labeled as non-fasting samples, and the main aminoacidopathies identified were Phenylketonuria and Maple Syrup Urine Disorder.

This cross-sectional study included mothers and/or fathers of children < 18 years of age affected by IEMs requiring a restricted diet (except phenylketonuria) from January 2015 to December 2017. Parents' QoL was assessed using the World Health Organization Quality of Life BREF questionnaire and compared with age- and sex-matched reference values from the French general population. Linear mixed models were used to examine the effects of demographic, socioeconomic, disease-related, and psychocognitive factors on parental QoL, according to a 2-level regression model considering individuals (parents) nested within families. Of the 1156 parents invited to participate, 785 (68%) were included. Compared with the general population, parents of children with IEMs requiring a restricted diet reported a lower QoL in physical and social relationship domains but a higher QoL in the psychological domain. In the multivariate analysis, characteristics associated with poorer parental QoL included both parent-related factors (being a father, older age, more educated parent, nonworking parent, greater anxiety, seeking more social support, and using less positive thinking and problem-solving coping strategies) and family-related factors (disease complications, increased number of hospital medical providers, child's younger age, single-parent family, and lower family material wealth). Parents of children with IEMs requiring a restricted diet reported poorer QoL in physical and social relationship domains than population norms. Psychocognitive factors, beyond disease-specific and family-related characteristics, were the most important determinants influencing parental QoL and may represent essential aspects for interventions.

    "abstract": "There are about 1500 genetic metabolic diseases. A small number of treatable diseases are diagnosed by newborn screening programs, which are continually being developed. However, most diseases can only be diagnosed based on clinical symptoms or metabolic findings. The main biological fluids used are urine, plasma and, in special situations, cerebrospinal fluid. In contrast to commonly used methods such as gas chromatography and high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry, ex vivo proton spectroscopy (<sup>1</sup> H-NMR) is not yet used in routine clinical practice, although it has been recommended for more than 30 years. Automatic analysis and improved NMR technology have also expanded the applications used for the diagnosis of inborn errors of metabolism. We provide a mini-overview of typical applications, especially in urine but also in plasma, used to diagnose common but also rare genetic metabolic diseases with <sup>1</sup> H-NMR. The use of computer-assisted diagnostic suggestions can facilitate interpretation of the profiles. In a proof of principle, to date, 182 reports of 59 different diseases and 500 reports of healthy children are stored. The percentage of correct automatic diagnoses was 74%. Using the same <sup>1</sup> H-NMR profile-targeted analysis, it is possible to apply an untargeted approach that distinguishes profile differences from healthy individuals. Thus, additional conditions such as lysosomal storage diseases or drug interferences are detectable. Furthermore, because <sup>1</sup> H-NMR is highly reproducible and can detect a variety of different substance categories, the metabolomic approach is suitable for monitoring patient treatment and revealing additional factors such as nutrition and microbiome metabolism. Besides the progress in analytical techniques, a multiomics approach is most effective to combine metabolomics with, for example, whole exome sequencing, to also diagnose patients with nondetectable metabolic abnormalities in biological fluids. In this mini review we also provide our own data to demonstrate the role of NMR in a multiomics platform in the field of inborn errors of metabolism."

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an inborn error of metabolism. Mutations in the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH)-encoding gene lead to a decreased metabolism of the amino acid phenylalanine (Phe). The deficiency in PAH increases Phe levels in blood and brain. Accumulation of Phe can lead to delayed development, psychiatric problems and cognitive impairment. White matter (WM) damage is a neuropathological hallmark of PKU and can be seen even in early detected and treated PKU patients. The mechanisms linking high Phe concentrations to WM abnormalities remain unclear. We tested the effects of high Phe concentrations on myelin in three <i>in vitro</i> models of increasing complexity: two simple cell culture models and one model that preserves local brain tissue architecture, a cerebellar organotypic slice culture prepared from postnatal day (P) 8 CD-1 mice. Various Phe concentrations (0.1-10 mM) and durations of exposure were tested. We found no toxic effect of high Phe in the cell culture models. On the contrary, the treatment promoted the maturation of oligodendrocytes, particularly at the highest, non-physiological Phe concentrations. Exposure of cerebellar organotypic slices to 2.4 mM Phe for 21 days <i>in vitro</i> (DIV), but not 7 or 10 DIV, resulted in a significant decrease in myelin basic protein (MBP), calbindin-stained neurites, and neurites co-stained with MBP. Following exposure to a toxic concentration of Phe, a switch to the control medium for 7 days did not lead to remyelination, while very active remyelination was seen in slices following demyelination with lysolecithin. An enhanced number of microglia, displaying an activated type morphology, was seen after exposure of the slices to 2.4 mM Phe for 10 or 21 DIV. The results suggest that prolonged exposure to high Phe concentrations can induce microglial activation preceding significant disruption of myelin."

Anthropometric and biochemical assessments were performed and food intake was documented, and an ultrasound diagnosis of NAFLD was established. Data were evaluated using the Student's t-test for continuous variables, the chi-square for categorical variables, and logistic regression using the Wald chi-squared test; differences with p < 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. NAFLD was detected in 26 (25.7%) teenagers. There was no difference in prevalence between the sexes or nutritional status. The final logistic regression model revealed low sensitivity (26.1%) and high specificity (94.7%). The specificity suggested a lower likelihood of NAFLD in older adolescents, in the presence of normal or high levels of alkaline phosphatase, lower carbohydrate intake, and adequate protein and lipid intake. The prevalence of NAFLD in adolescents with PKU was higher than that found in healthy Brazilian adolescents and similar to that found in obese Brazilian children, suggesting a higher risk for NAFLD in patients with PKU treated exclusively by dietary modification."

    "title": "Breastfeeding in Phenylketonuria: Changing Modalities, Changing Perspectives.",
    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) management aims to control phenylalanine (Phe) intakes. In newborns and infants this implies possible titration of Human milk (HM) with supplementation of Phe-free formula. HM benefits, better if prolonged, are well known in healthy populations, suggesting it may be used in PKU patients. Despite that, the current literature does not define recommendations on how best perform it in such a population. The main purpose of this study was to evaluate nutrition approaches in newborns and infants affected by PKU and to define if differences can influence the duration of breastfeeding. Data from 42 PKU infants were reviewed. Of these, 67% were breastfed with the use of three different approaches. The type of approach used impacted the duration of breastfeeding, which was longer when using a pre-measured amount of Phe-free formula administered prior to HM. This is the first study to suggest a specific method for breastfeeding in PKU. Considering widely known breastfeeding benefits, both for patients and their mothers, our data should encourage adequate awareness on how to choose correct breastfeeding modalities."

    "title": "Characterization of Choline Nutriture among Adults and Children with Phenylketonuria.",
    "abstract": "Choline is an essential nutrient for brain development and function that is attained through high-protein foods, which are limited in the phenylalanine-restricted diet of people with phenylketonuria (PKU). This study compared choline consumption among individuals with PKU to a reference sample from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), and identified treatment and diet-related factors that may modulate choline needs. Participants were individuals with PKU (<i>n</i> = 120, 4-61 years) managed with dietary therapy alone (<i>n</i> = 49), sapropterin dihydrochloride for ≥1 year (<i>n</i> = 38), or pegvaliase for ≥1 year with no medical food (<i>n</i> = 33). NHANES participants were not pregnant or nursing and came from the 2015-2018 cycles (<i>n</i> = 10,681, 4-70 years). Dietary intake data were used to estimate total usual intake distributions for choline, and mean probability of adequacy (MPA) was calculated as a summary index of nutrient adequacy for four methyl-donor/co-factor nutrients that impact choline utilization (folate, vitamin B12, vitamin B6, and methionine). Only 10.8% (SE: 2.98) of the total PKU sample (14.7% [SE: 4.03] of children; 6.8% [SE: 2.89] of adults) achieved the adequate intake (AI) for choline, while 12.2% (SE:0.79) of the NHANES sample met the recommended level. Adults receiving pegvaliase were the most likely to exceed the AI for choline (14.82% [SE: 4.48]), while adults who were on diet therapy alone were the least likely (5.59% [SE: 2.95]). Without fortified medical foods, individuals on diet therapy and sapropterin would not be able to achieve the AI, and MPA for other methyl donor/co-factor nutrients would be reduced. More frequent monitoring of choline intake and increased choline fortification of medical foods could benefit this population."

    "abstract": "In the Netherlands, abnormal New-Born Screening (NBS) results are communicated to parents by the general practitioner (GP). Good communication and consequential trust in professionals is of the utmost importance in the treatment of phenylketonuria (PKU). The aim of this study was to assess parental satisfaction regarding the communication of an abnormal NBS result for PKU in the Netherlands. An email containing the link to a web-based questionnaire was sent by the Dutch PKU Association to their members. Responses to open questions were categorized, data of both open and closed questions were analysed with descriptive statistics and the Chi-Square test using SPSS. Out of 113 parents of a child with PKU (born between 1979 and 2020), 68 stated they were overall unsatisfied with the first communication of the NBS result. Seventy-five parents indicated that wrong or no information about PKU was given. A significant decrease was found in the number of parents being contact by their own GP over the course of 40 years (p < 0.05). More than half of all parents were overall unsatisfied with the first communication of the abnormal NBS result for PKU. Further research on how to optimize communication of an abnormal NBS results is necessary."

    "abstract": "Abnormalities of the cortical white matter are the most prominent and widely-reported neurological findings in individuals with early-treated phenylketonuria (ETPKU). Much less is known regarding the effects of ETPKU on gray matter structures in the brain such as the basal ganglia. Previous findings on basal ganglia in ETPKU have been mixed. The current study was designed to further elucidate the effects of ETPKU and elevated phe levels on the morphometry of basal ganglia structures (i.e., putamen, caudate nucleus, nucleus accumbens, and globus pallidus). High resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data was collected from a sample of 37 adults with ETPKU and a demographically-matched comparison group of 33 individuals without PKU. No overall group differences (ETPKU vs. non-PKU) in basal ganglia volumes were observed. However, within the ETPKU group, poorer metabolic control (as reflected by higher blood phenylalanine levels) was associated with larger putamen volume. Vertex-wise shape analysis revealed that the volume increase was accompanied by shape changes in the middle left putamen. Consistent with this area's role in motor control, a significant correlation between left putamen volume and motor performance was also observed. Additional research is needed to fully understand the cellular level processes underlying this effect as well as to better understand the clinical impact of these morphometric changes and their potential relation to treatment response."

    "abstract": "This study was designed to show the changes in glycolmacropeptides (GMPs) of whey protein solution (WPS) due to different pretreatments before and after ultrafiltration (UF). The combined form of two variants (A&B) of GMPs is a helpful compound for nutritional management of phenylketonuria and ulcerative-colitis diseases and has low content of phenylalanine (Phe). WPS with 10% concentration was prepared, acidified (adjusted to pH = 3.0), and passed through a PES (polyethersulfone) membrane in the 1<sup>st</sup>-stage of ultrafiltration (UF-1). Then the resulting permeate was neutralized and went through the 2<sup>nd</sup>-stage of ultrafiltration (UF-2) under similar conditions. Four experiments of TRT-CON, CON-TRT, TRT-TRT, and CON-CON were used with different pretreatments, where TRT was a mixing-treatment of 30 min at 150 RPM applied either after acidification of WPS or after neutralization of first permeate and before UF-2 process. While the concentration and purity of the combined GMPs in UF-2 retentate in TRT-TRT respectively were >95.6 and 99.5%, its Phe became <10 ppm among the experiments. Highly glycolyzed polymers of GMPs (MW = 45-50 kDa) were formed in the TRT-TRT experiment and went through the pore sizes of PES membrane of UF-1 easily because of their flexible structure. However, they remained in the UF-2 retentate, due to to the formation of bulky polymers. The TRT-TRT experiment had the highest reversible and irreversible resistances for passing through the UF-1 and remaining on the UF-2 membranes, and its fouling index was significantly less than other experiments."

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an inborn metabolic error characterized by a deficiency of the enzyme required for the metabolism of phenylalanine, an essential amino acid found in most protein-containing foods. Pegvaliase (Palynziq®) is an enzyme substitution therapy approved for adults with PKU who have inadequate blood phenylalanine control (≥600 μmol/L) on existing management. To characterize the treatment, discontinuation, and dosing patterns in patients treated with pegvaliase in real-world practice settings in the United States following commercial availability in 2018. Retrospective cohort study using BioMarin's proprietary drug dispense database associated with the pegvaliase REMS program. Sample construction identified all patients who properly initiated pegvaliase in real world settings ('full cohort') and a subset of patients ('extended follow-up cohort') with ≥12 months between first dispense of maximum dose and last pegvaliase dispense. Key outcomes were quantified across patients in both cohorts: maximum daily dose; time to maximum daily dose; maximum daily syringes; and dose escalation over time. The overall dose at discontinuation and time to discontinuation were calculated. Patients who subsequently reinitiated therapy were identified. For the extended follow-up cohort, 12-month changes in dose and syringes and dispensing gaps during the 12 months after maximum dose were quantified across all patients and were further stratified by maximum dose. Overall, 1596 patients associated with 33,814 dispenses were reflected in the pegvaliase dispense dataset during the study period from July 9, 2018, through December 31, 2021; 1280 patients associated with 25,973 dispenses met inclusion criteria for the full cohort, with 19.9 dispenses each on average. Of these patients, 483 patients associated with 15,149 dispenses also met the extended follow-up criteria, with an average of 31.4 dispenses.Average treatment duration in the full cohort was 82.2 weeks, including 50.8 weeks after maximum daily dose was achieved. The average maximum daily dose was 30 mg with an average time to maximum dose of 31.8 weeks: 43.0% of patients had a maximum dose of 20 mg, 31.3% a maximum dose of 40 mg, and 12.0% a maximum dose of 60 mg. At data cut-off, 289 patients (22.6%) had discontinued; within this group, 126 patients (43.6%) discontinued within the first 6 months after reaching maximum dose.The overall average treatment duration for patients in the extended follow up cohort at data cut off was 131.2 weeks, including 98.6 weeks after maximum dose was achieved. The average maximum daily dose across the cohort was 32.9 mg: 42.4% of patients had a maximum dose of 20 mg, 41.0% a maximum dose of 40 mg, and 11.2% a maximum dose of 60 mg. At 12 months after achieving maximum dose, 35% of patients had down-dosed, with a 46.8% decrease (on average) from their maximum dose. Real-world use of pegvaliase reflects longer titration periods than in the dosing schedule based on trial experience. Over time, a substantial number of patients are able to reduce their daily dose by titrating down from their maximum dose, a finding of great interest to clinicians and patients alike."

    "abstract": "This paper represents a portion of the findings from one of the first research studies eliciting the lived experience of adults with an early diagnosis of Phenylketonuria (PKU) living in Ireland. Ireland has one of the highest prevalence rates of PKU in Europe, however, little is known about the experience of Irish adults with PKU. Furthermore, Ireland is one of the first countries in the world to introduce neonatal screening followed by the introduction of long-term dietary therapy over 50 years ago. This study presents the first comprehensive assessment of the lived experience of Irish adults with PKU on long term dietary therapy. Narrative data was collected from eleven self-selected participants, using semi-structured interviews. The interviews were divided into five sections focused on eliciting a holistic understanding of the lived experience of adults with PKU living in Ireland. Thematic analysis was guided by Colaizzi's Framework (1978) in conjunction with NVivo qualitative data analysis software. Findings from the original research encompassed a broad understanding of the lived experience of adults with PKU living in Ireland, including factors influencing dietary therapy and managing PHE blood levels. The themes being discussed within this article are those which appear to be least represented within current literature: living with PKU, including reproductive health, the importance of self-management and establishing routine, support networks in adulthood and concerns regarding aging with PKU. It was evident from the findings that a diagnosis of PKU can influence how adults with PKU may experience aging and their own mortality. These findings offer new insight into the vulnerability attached to the experience of aging with PKU and may be beneficial to advocacy groups and for future development of policy and practice."

Here, we aimed to examine the relationship between COVID-19 vaccination and metabolic outcome in paediatric IEM patients. Patients with IEM between the ages of 12 and 18 were enrolled. Term metabolic decompensation was defined as acute disruption in metabolic homeostasis due to vaccination. Clinical and biochemical markers were compared between pre- and post-vaccination periods. Data from a total of 36 vaccination episodes in 18 patients were included. Thirteen patients had intoxication-type metabolic disorders including organic acidemia (OA), urea cycle disorders (UCDs), maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) and phenylketonuria (PKU); 4 patients had energy metabolism disorders including fatty acid metabolism disorders and LIPIN 1 deficiency; and 1 patient had glycogen storage disorder (GSD) type 5. Seventeen patients received BNT162b2, and 1 received CoronaVac because of an underlying long QT syndrome. Fatty acid metabolism disorders, LIPIN 1 deficiency and GSD type 5 were included in the same group named 'metabolic myopathies'. In two PKU patients, plasma phenylalanine level increased significantly within 24 h following the second dose of vaccination. None of the OA, UCD, MSUD and metabolic myopathy patients experienced acute metabolic attack and had emergency department admission due to metabolic decompensation within 1 month after vaccination. COVID-19 vaccines did not cause acute metabolic decompensation in a cohort of 18 children with IEM."

Metabolic control, nutritional parameters, and dietary adherence were assessed in patients with PKU before (T0), and six months after (T6) starting a low protein diet using GMP. Selected items from the PKU-QOL questionnaire were used to assess patients' acceptance of their modified diet. 18 patients from three Italian Centres, completed the study. With the exception of LDL-cholesterol and vitamin 25OH-D concentrations, there were no differences between T0 and T6 in metabolic or nutritional parameters. Data suggested that patients have a good acceptance of protein substitutes containing GMP, probably because of their improved palatability. According to our patients' responses to items related to dietary regimen, GMP based protein substitutes do not appear to significantly affect QOL."

It enables the early start of metabolic treatment which might prevent potentially lethal neonatal disease manifestations, while promoting favorable development and long-term clinical outcomes. This study aims to assess growth in screened individuals with IMDs under different dietary regimes. Anthropometric data (3585 prospective measures) of 350 screened individuals with IMDs born between 1999 and 2018 and participating in a German prospective multicenter observational study were evaluated. Overall, birth measures were within the reference ranges, suggesting unaffected prenatal growth, except for phenylketonuria (weight) and glutaric aciduria Type 1 (head circumference). After birth, longitudinal analysis of anthropometric measures revealed a loss of height standard deviation score (SDS; -0.5 SDS; p < 0.0001), head circumference SDS (-0.2 SDS; p = 0.0028), but not for weight SDS (0.1 SDS; p = 0.5097) until the age of 18 years, while BMI SDS increased (0.4 SDS; p < 0.0001). The significant interaction with age and diet groups was pronounced for the linear growth in individuals receiving diets being low in protein, long-chain triglycerides, and galactose (p < 0.001). Identification by NBS and subsequent early (dietary) treatment cannot completely protect against alterations in growths. Disease-specific (e.g., metabolic impairments, neurotoxins) and dietary-specific (e.g., diets reduced in protein) factors may have an amplified impact on longitudinal growth. Therefore, alongside other important follow-ups, the continuous observation of the anthropometric development of screened individuals with IMDs needs special attention to early identify and support individuals at risk."

The present study aimed to address this gap by providing a comprehensive assessment of neuropsychological functioning among adults with ETPKU. A sample of 40 adults with ETPKU (ages 18 - 36) and a demographically matched group of 32 healthy individuals without PKU participated. Participants completed a comprehensive neuropsychological battery including the NIH Toolbox, Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence - Second Edition (WASI-II), Conners' Continuous Performance Test (CPT-3), select subtests from the Weschler Adult Intelligence Scale - Fourth Edition (WAIS-IV) as well as several self-report measures of cognitive and psychoemotional functioning. Scores from these tests were combined to create cognitive composites reflecting overall task performance in the areas of verbal ability, visuospatial skills, executive functioning, motor skills, and processing speed. No group differences were observed for full scale IQ or verbal ability. However, individuals with ETPKU demonstrated poorer performance on measures of executive functioning, processing speed, motor skills, and visuospatial skills as compared to the non-PKU group. Within the ETPKU group, recent blood phenylalanine levels (an indicator of metabolic control) were significantly correlated with performance across most cognitive domains and aspects of psychological functioning. Present findings suggest that the neuropsychological profile of adult ETPKU is characterized by circumscribed impairments in select cognitive domains. In addition, the results underscore the importance of maintaining metabolic control across the lifespan in individuals with ETPKU."

Once diagnosed by a definitive method, a patient's dietary control is performed by repeated analysis of phenylalanine in venous blood or DBS. Since venipuncture is time consuming, painful, and may often be difficult to achieve in newborns, the use of DBS for analysis of phenylalanine is becoming a preferred method for dietary monitoring of patients with PKU. Using a lancet, patients or their guardians collect finger capillary blood on an approved filter paper. Once collected, the filter paper with DBS is sent to the laboratory for phenylalanine analysis. In the laboratory, phenylalanine is extracted from the DBS using organic solvents. Here, we describe an LC-MS/MS method for the analysis of phenylalanine from DBS with an approximation to serum levels."

However, whether such a relationship exists with cortical gray matter is still unknown. Therefore, we investigated cortical thickness and surface area in adults with early-treated PKU and their relationship to cognitive functions and metabolic control. We included 30 adult patients with early-treated and metabolically well-controlled PKU (median age: 35.5 years) and 54 healthy controls (median age: 29.3 years). Surface-based morphometry was derived from T1-weighted magnetic resonance images using FreeSurfer, and general intelligence, executive functions, and attention were assessed. Concurrent plasma Phe, tyrosine, and tryptophan levels were measured in patients. In addition, Phe levels were collected retrospectively to calculate the index of dietary control. Patients showed a thinner cortex than controls in regions of the bilateral temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes (effect size r = -0.34 to -0.42, p < 0.05). No group differences in surface area were found. In patients, accuracy in the working memory task was positively correlated with thickness in the left insula (r = 0.45, p = 0.013), left fusiform gyrus (r = 0.39, p = 0.032), and right superior temporal gyrus (r = 0.41, p = 0.024), but did not survive false discovery rate correction. Neither concurrent nor historical metabolic parameters were related to cortical thickness. Taken together, adults with PKU showed widespread reductions in cortical thickness despite good metabolic control in childhood and adolescence. However, alterations in cortical thickness were unrelated to metabolic parameters and cognitive performance."

We also assessed genotype and phenotype correlation in patients with PAHD. A total of 44 different pathogenic variants were identified, including five novel variants. The three most prevalent variants among all patents were c.158G > A, p.(Arg53His) (18.03%), c.721C > T, p.(Arg241Cys) (14.75%), and c.728G > A, p.(Arg243Gln) (7.65%).

The most abundant genotypes observed in PAHD patients were c.[158G > A];[728G > A], c.[158G > A];[442-1G > A], and c.[158G > A];[721C > T]. Comparing allelic phenotype to genotypic phenotype values yielded fairly accurate predictions of phenotype, with an overall consistency rate was 85.71% for PAHD patients. Our study identified a PAH variant spectrum in PAHD patients from Fujian Province, Southeastern China. Quantitative correlation analysis between genotype and phenotype severity is helpful for genetic counseling and management."

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a metabolic disorder connected to an excess of phenylalanine (Phe) in the blood and tissues, with neurological consequences. The disease's molecular bases seem to be related to the accumulation of Phe at the cell membrane surface. Radiological outcomes in the brain demonstrate decreased water diffusivity in white matter, involving axon dysmyelination of not yet understood origin. We used a biophysical approach and model membranes to extend our knowledge of Phe-membrane interaction by clarifying Phe's propensity to affect membrane structure and dynamics based on lipid composition, with emphasis on modulating cholesterol and glycolipid components to mimic raft domains and myelin sheath membranes. Phe showed affinity for the investigated membrane mimics, mainly affecting the Phe-facing membrane leaflet. The surfaces of our neuronal membrane raft mimics were strong anchoring sites for Phe, showing rigidifying effects. From a therapeutic perspective, we further investigated the role of doxycycline, known to disturb Phe packing, unveiling its action as a competitor in Phe interactions with the membrane, suggesting its potential for treatment in the early stages of PKU. Our results suggest how Phe accumulation in extracellular fluids can impede normal growth of myelin sheaths by interfering with membrane slipping and by remodulating free water and myelin-associated water contents."

Recently, there has been an increased emphasis on intelligent, customized treatments with a focus on long-term efficacy; however, traditional probiotic therapy has not kept up with this trend. The use of synthetic biology to construct gut-engineered probiotics as live therapeutics is a promising avenue in the treatment of specific diseases, such as phenylketonuria and inflammatory bowel disease. These studies generally involve a series of fundamental design issues: choosing an engineered chassis, improving the colonization ability of engineered probiotics, designing functional gene circuits, and ensuring the safety of engineered probiotics. In this review, we summarize the relevant past research, the progress of current research, and discuss the key issues that restrict the widespread application of intestinal engineered probiotic living therapeutics."

    "title": "Present and future of lipid nanoparticle-mRNA technology in phenylketonuria disease treatment.",
    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a metabolic rare disease characterized by a failure of the body to clear out the high levels of Phenylalanine (Phe), leading to devastating neurological defects and growth retardation. PKU was discovered in 1934 by AsbjrØrn FØlling, and even though there have been continuous efforts from the scientific community to find therapeutic approaches to modulate the high levels of phenylalanine found in the body of the PKU patients, an efficient therapy still needs to be developed. Current standard of care includes low phenylalanine diets, but the strict restrictions for patients and families makes it very difficult to adequately being implemented. FDA has approved two drugs to help reduce Phe levels in PKU patients: an enzyme substitution therapy, Palynziq® (PEGylated recombinant phenylalanine ammonia lyase), and Kuvan®, a supplemental tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) cofactor that enhances residual enzyme activity. Both treatments are restricted to certain PKU patients' population, and, therefore, there are still high unmet needs for most of the patients. The present review will focus on current advancements in lipid nanoparticles (LNP)-mRNA technologies and their potential in treating the root cause of PKU, a therapeutic approach that will be analyzed in the context of other promising therapeutic approaches that are been developed for PKU."

    "abstract": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and phenylketonuria (PKU) patients need to eat rice with low glutelin content. Therefore, breeding low glutelin content rice varieties with high yield and delicious taste is one of the major goals of rice breeders due to the high demand for the product. In this study, we designed three sgRNAs targeting nine glutelin genes and generated nine T-DNA-free homozygous editing lines with reduced glutelin content compared with the wild-type due to simultaneous mutation(s) in 5-7 glutelin genes. The glutelin content of two lines is even significantly lower than that of the low glutelin content cultivar, LGC-1. Compared to the wild-type, these low glutelin lines showed similar agronomic traits, including yield components and viscosity properties, and can be used as new varieties or parental materials for further breeding."

    "title": "Impact of pregnancy planning and preconceptual dietary training on metabolic control and offspring's outcome in phenylketonuria.",
    "abstract": "To prevent maternal phenylketonuria (PKU) syndrome low phenylalanine concentrations (target range, 120-360 μmol/L) during pregnancy are recommended for women with PKU. We evaluated the feasibility and effectiveness of current recommendations and identified factors influencing maternal metabolic control and children's outcome. Retrospective study of first successfully completed pregnancies of 85 women with PKU from 12 German centers using historical data and interviews with the women. Children's outcome was evaluated by standardized IQ tests and parental rating of child behavior. Seventy-four percent (63/85) of women started treatment before conception, 64% (54/85) reached the phenylalanine target range before conception. Pregnancy planning resulted in earlier achievement of the phenylalanine target (18 weeks before conception planned vs. 11 weeks of gestation unplanned, p < 0.001) and lower plasma phenylalanine concentrations during pregnancy, particularly in the first trimester (0-7 weeks of gestation: 247 μmol/L planned vs. 467 μmol/L unplanned, p < 0.0001; 8-12 weeks of gestation: 235 μmol/L planned vs. 414 μmol/L unplanned, p < 0.001). Preconceptual dietary training increased the success rate of achieving the phenylalanine target before conception compared to women without training (19 weeks before conception vs. 9 weeks of gestation, p < 0.001). The majority (93%) of children had normal IQ (mean 103, median age 7.3 years); however, IQ decreased with increasing phenylalanine concentration during pregnancy. Good metabolic control during pregnancy is the prerequisite to prevent maternal PKU syndrome in the offspring. This can be achieved by timely provision of detailed information, preconceptual dietary training, and careful planning of pregnancy."

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is hyperphenylalaninemia that develops due to a deficiency of the phenylalanine hydroxylase enzyme (PAH). Identification of variants in the <i>PAH</i> gene is necessary for verification of the diagnosis, choice of treatment tactics, detection of heterozygous carriers. The aim of the study was to analyze the effectiveness of identification of selected pathological variants in the <i>PAH</i> gene during the newborn screening program. This study relied on the results of the examination of 257 patients (138 boys and 119 girls) with hyperphenylalaninemia from different regions of Ukraine. Genotyping was performed on nine pathogenic variants in <i>PAH</i> gene: I65T, R261Q, G272*, R252W, R261*, R408W, IVS12 + 1G > A, Y414C, IVS10-11G > A. According to the results of the study, variants R408W (AF = 52.7%), R252W (AF = 3.5%) and Y414C (AF = 1.8%) were the most common. More than half of the examined patients (51.7%) had a compound genotype with a major variant of R408W in one allele. Approximately a quarter of the examined patients (26.8%) had the R408W/R408W genotype. In 12.1% of patients, the applied panel of variants of the <i>РАН</i> gene did not allow us to identify the pathogenic variant in any allele. We conclude that the selected panel allowed us to identify the presence of variants in 87.9% of patients with PKU. The panel of genetic testing in the <i>PAH</i> gene for the newborns that we used for the study allows accurate prediction of some phenotypes for therapy planning. But in-depth analysis of pathological gene variants may be necessary for unclear and difficult cases of the disease, and for genetic counseling of patients families."

    "abstract": "In 2018, pegvaliase was approved as the first enzyme substitution treatment for phenylketonuria (PKU) and is now the second medication available for PKU patients since the approval of sapropterin dihydrochloride in 2007. Historically, dietary management has been the mainstay of treatment for PKU. While sapropterin response rate is limited to approximately 50% of PKU patients, pegvaliase has the potential to reduce phenylalanine levels in all PKU patients (Vockley et al., 2014; Longo et al., 2019 [1,3]). Current FDA labeling for pegvaliase includes a dose maximum of 60 mg daily (Longo et al., 2019; BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc., 2020 [3,4]). We report a case series of four phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) deficient patients, previously treated with dietary management only, who initiated treatment with pegvaliase and were titrated to 80 mg daily dosing. The safety profile in these four cases did not differ from lower maintenance dosing (Longo et al., 2019 [3]). Subsequent decreases in Phe levels were observed on 80 mg maintenance dosing, allowing for individualized dietary liberalization in three out of four patients. We conclude that pegvaliase dosing must be personalized to achieve therapeutic goals and that some patients may require higher doses than those included on the product label."

    "abstract": "Early treated patients with phenylketonuria (PKU) often become lost to follow-up from adolescence onwards due to the historical focus of PKU care on the pediatric population and lack of programs facilitating the transition to adulthood. As a result, evidence on the management of adolescents and young adults with PKU is limited. Two meetings were held with a multidisciplinary international panel of 25 experts in PKU and comorbidities frequently experienced by patients with PKU. Based on the outcomes of the first meeting, a set of statements were developed. During the second meeting, these statements were voted on for consensus generation (≥70% agreement), using a modified Delphi approach. A total of 37 consensus recommendations were developed across five areas that were deemed important in the management of adolescents and young adults with PKU: (1) general physical health, (2) mental health and neurocognitive functioning, (3) blood Phe target range, (4) PKU-specific challenges, and (5) transition to adult care. The consensus recommendations reflect the personal opinions and experiences from the participating experts supported with evidence when available. Overall, clinicians managing adolescents and young adults with PKU should be aware of the wide variety of PKU-associated comorbidities, initiating screening at an early age. In addition, management of adolescents/young adults should be a joint effort between the patient, clinical center, and parents/caregivers supporting adolescents with gradually gaining independent control of their disease during the transition to adulthood. A multidisciplinary international group of experts used a modified Delphi approach to develop a set of consensus recommendations with the aim of providing guidance and offering tools to clinics to aid with supporting adolescents and young adults with PKU."

    "abstract": "Rapid advances in technology and data science have the potential to improve the precision of preventive and therapeutic interventions, and enable the right treatment to be recommended, at the right time, to the right person. There are well-described examples of successful precision medicine approaches for monogenic conditions such as specific diets for phenylketonuria, and sulfonylurea treatments for certain types of MODY. However, the majority of chronic diseases are polygenic, and it is unlikely that the research strategies used for monogenic diseases will deliver similar changes to practice for polygenic traits. Type 2 diabetes, for example, is a multifactorial, heterogeneous, polygenic palette of metabolic disorders. In this non-systematic review I highlight limitations of the evidence, and the challenges that need to be overcome prior to implementation of precision medicine in the prevention and management of type 2 diabetes. Most precision medicine approaches are spuriously precise, overly complex and too narrowly focused on predicting blood glucose levels with a limited set of characteristics of individuals rather than the whole person and their context. Overall, the evidence to date is insufficient to justify widespread implementation of precision medicine approaches into routine clinical practice for type 2 diabetes. We need to retain a degree of humility and healthy scepticism when evaluating novel strategies, and to demand that existing evidence thresholds are exceeded prior to implementation."

    "abstract": "Measurement of dried blood spot (DBS) phenylalanine (Phe) is central to the monitoring of patients with phenylketonuria. However, the volume and hematocrit (Hct) of the blood applied to conventional DBS cards significantly affects analytical results. Volumetric blood collection devices are reported to be more accurate, precise and less prone to Hct effects. Accuracy, imprecision, effect of blood volume and Hct were evaluated for measurement of Phe and tyrosine using three volumetric devices and compared with the conventional PerkinElmer-226 filter-paper collection devices. i.e. conventional DBS cards. Applicability for use in a clinical laboratory was assessed qualitatively. Blood volume did not impact on the performance of the volumetric devices; however, significant biases were observed with the conventional DBS card. A higher Hct introduced unacceptable bias for Neoteryx-Mitra and conventional DBS card. All devices had a mean relative standard deviation (RSD) ≤ 4.1 %, except for the Neoteryx-Mitra (≤ 6.2 %). Relative to liquid blood, the mean biases of Phe for the various devices were -5.1 (HemaXis-DB10), -7.8 (Capitainer-qDBS), -12.0 (Neoteryx-Mitra) and -32.6 % (conventional DBS card). Introducing volumetric collection devices will overcome the significant pre-analytical issues associated with conventional DBS collection and improve the biochemical monitoring of patients with PKU."

    "abstract": "Phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) is a key enzyme in mammals that maintains the phenylalanine (Phe) concentration at an appropriate physiological level. Some genetic mutations in the PAH gene lead to destabilization of the PAH enzyme, leading to phenylketonuria (PKU). Destabilized PAH variants can have a certain amount of residual enzymatic activity that is sufficient for metabolism of Phe. However, accelerated degradation of those variants can lead to insufficient amounts of cellular PAH protein. The optimal protein level of PAH in cells is regulated by a balancing act between E3 ligases and deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs). In this work, we analyzed the protein expression and stability of two PKU-linked PAH protein variants, R241C and R243Q, prevalent in the Asian population. We found that the tested PAH variants were highly ubiquitinated and thus targeted for rapid protein degradation. We demonstrated that USP19, a DUB that interacts with both PAH variants, plays a regulatory role by extending their half-lives. The deubiquitinating activity of USP19 prevents protein degradation and increases the abundance of both PAH protein variants. Thus, our study reveals a novel mechanism by which deubiquitinating activity of USP19 extends the residual enzymatic activity of PAH variants."

    "abstract": "Novel pharmaceutical therapies such as pegvaliase, phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), have enhanced disease control for many individuals with phenylketonuria (PKU). We present a retrospective chart review to assess pegvaliase doses over time in individuals followed at the Boston Children's Hospital PAL Clinic, including those who started pegvaliase in a clinical trial (\"trial patients\") and those who started after drug came to market (\"post-market patients\"). Trial patients were on pegvaliase an average of 4.8 years longer, and their mean current pegvaliase dose was 126 ± 92 compared to 223 ± 147 mg/week for post-market patients (p = 0.0155), suggesting that the pegvaliase dose for target efficacy may decrease over time in adults with PKU. In post-market patients, we demonstrated a significant, inverse correlation with dose change and number of weeks from response (r = -0.46, p = 0.046). The entire cohort showed significant variability in terms of time to achieve a therapeutic response, response dose, and current dose. Our data suggest that patients tolerate a reduction in pegvaliase dose over time while maintaining efficacy. This is a clinically meaningful finding as it indicates that patients may reduce number of weekly injections over time on pegvaliase."

    "abstract": "A phenylalanine (Phe)-restricted diet is indispensable for individuals suffering from phenylketonuria (PKU). Our previous study reported a low-Phe-containing whey protein hydrolysate (LPH) prepared from a selected whey protein hydrolysate (TA2H). This study aimed to investigate the osteogenic activity of LPH and TA2H in MC3T3-E1 preosteoblast cells and explore the underlying mechanism. Results showed that the treatment of TA2H and LPH (at the final concentrations of 100-1000 μg/mL) had a stimulatory effect on the proliferation, differentiation, and mineralization of MC3T3-E1 cells. The LPH of 1000 μg/mL significantly increased cell proliferation (2.15- ± 0.11-fold) and alkaline phosphatase activity (1.22- ± 0.07-fold), promoted the protein and mRNA levels of runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2, 2.50- ± 0.14-fold and 2.97- ± 0.23-fold, respectively), enhanced the expression of differentiation biomarkers (type-I collagen, osteocalcin, and osteopontin), increased calcium deposition (1.56- ± 0.08-fold), and upregulated the ratio of osteoprotegerin/receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand. The exploration of signaling pathways indicated that the activated p38-dependent Runx2 signaling contributed to the LPH-induced osteogenesis. These results provided evidence, for the first time, that a prepared low-Phe whey protein hydrolysate positively modulated the activity of osteoblasts through the p38/Runx2 pathway, thereby providing a new osteoinductive protein substitute to make functional PKU food."

We aimed to elucidate the incidence, proportion, and genetic features of HPA in a southern Chinese population. We analyzed the HPA screening results for 580,460 newborns from 2014 to 2021. Of the 296 newborns who tested HPA positive, 56 were diagnosed with HPA, including 47 with phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency and nine with tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency (BH<sub>4</sub>D). HPA incidence was estimated to be 1:10,365 newborns. All patients had elevated Phe and Phe/Tyr levels. Thirty-three PAH variants and five PTS variants were detected in HPA patients; 80.6 % PAH variants and 100 % PTS variants were classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic. In silico tools predicted the remaining variants to be damaging. PAH variants clustered in exons 3, 5, 7, 11, and 12 and PTS variants clustered in exons 2 and 5. The most common PAH variants were c.158G > A (p.R53H, 22.3 %) and c.721C > T (p.R241C, 14.9 %). The most common PTS variants were c.155A > G (p.N52S, 50.0 %) and c.259C > T (p.P87S, 33.3 %). Newborn screening is an effective method for early detection of HPA, but differential diagnosis of BH<sub>4</sub>D is necessary."

The development of gene therapy for IMDs aims to provide sufficient gene activity to address the underlying causes of these conditions. This study surveyed health care providers (HCPs) to characterize their familiarity with gene therapy technologies and to identify educational needs across roles in a multidisciplinary care team. The link to a Web-based, 26-question survey was distributed to HCPs in North America and Europe who were involved in IMD patient care. Results were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Of the 590 survey link recipients, 64 completed the survey. Of these, 35 (55%) respondents were physicians, 23 (36%) were dietitians, 3 (5%) were nurse practitioners, 2 (3%) were genetic counselors, and 1 (2%) was a nurse. Most survey respondents (88% [n = 56 of 64]) reported the belief that gene therapy for IMDs would be available within 5 years of study conduct. Although nearly all physicians (97% [n = 34 of 35]) expressed awareness of gene therapy, rates of reported familiarity were lower among dietitians (57% [n = 13 of 23]); confidence in conversations with colleagues and patients/caregivers was also discordant. Nearly all HCPs wanted education on gene therapy advancements, and the most preferred informational sources were published literature and congress presentations. There is an urgent need for education on topics related to gene therapy modalities. Professional education on gene therapies is desired across all specialties and will be important for unified treatment practices in IMD care."

We conducted a systematic literature review to characterize the impact of PKU on affected individuals and on healthcare resources in Latin American (LATAM) countries. Searches of the global medical literature as well as regional and local medical literature up to September 2021. Observational studies on patients with PKU from any LATAM country. Pairs of reviewers independently screened eligible articles, extracted data from included studies, and assessed their risk of bias. 79 unique studies (47 cross-sectional studies, 18 case series, 12 case reports, and two cohort studies) with a total of 4090 patients were eligible. Of these studies, 20 had data available evaluating early-diagnosed PKU patients for meta-analysis of burden outcomes.

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU), a disease resulting in the disability to degrade phenylalanine (Phe) is an inborn error with a 1 in 10,000 morbidity rate on average around the world which leads to neurotoxicity. As an potential alternative to a protein-restricted diet, oral intake of engineered probiotics degrading Phe inside the body is a promising treatment, currently at clinical stage II (Isabella, et al., 2018). However, limited transmembrane transport of Phe is a bottleneck to further improvement of the probiotic's activity. Here, we achieved simultaneous degradation of Phe both intracellularly and extracellularly by expressing genes encoding the Phe-metabolizing enzyme phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) as an intracellularly free and a cell surface-immobilized enzyme in Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) which overcomes the transportation problem. The metabolic engineering strategy was also combined with strengthening of Phe transportation, transportation of PAL-catalyzed trans-cinnamic acid and fixation of released ammonia. Administration of our final synthetic strain TYS8500 with PAL both displayed on the cell surface and expressed inside the cell to the Pah<sup>F263S</sup> PKU mouse model reduced blood Phe concentration by 44.4% compared to the control EcN, independent of dietary protein intake. TYS8500 shows great potential in future applications for PKU therapy."

    "title": "[Advances in separation and analysis of aromatic amino acids in food].",
    "abstract": "Amino acids are important building blocks of proteins in the human body, which are involved in many metabolic pathways. Patients with metabolic diseases such as phenylketonuria, tyrosinemia, and hepatic encephalopathy are genetically defective and cannot metabolize aromatic amino acids (AAA) in food; hence, a regular diet may lead to permanent physiological damage. For this reason, it is necessary to restrict the intake of AAA in their daily diet by limiting natural protein intake, while ensuring normal intake of low protein foods and supplementation with low-AAA protein equivalents. Sources of low-AAA protein equivalents currently rely on free amino acid complex mixtures and low-AAA peptides (also known as high-Fischer-ratio peptides), which have better absorption availability and palatability. AAA separation and analysis techniques are essential for the preparation and detection of low-AAA peptides. Researchers in this field have explored a variety of efficient adsorption materials to selectively remove AAA from complex protein hydrolysates and thus prepare low-AAA peptide foods, or to establish analysis strategies for AAA. Covering more than 70 publications on AAA removal and separation in the last decade from Web of Science Core Collection and China National Knowledge Infrastructure, this review analyzes the structural characteristics and physicochemical properties of AAA, and summarizes the technological progress of AAA removal based on adsorbents such as activated carbon and resin. The applications of two-dimensional nanomaterials, molecular imprinting, cyclodextrins, and metal-organic frameworks in AAA adsorption and analysis from three dimensions, i. e., sample pretreatment, chiral separation and adsorption sensing, are also reviewed. The mainstream adsorbents for AAA removal, such as activated carbon, still suffer from poor specificity and cause environmental pollution during post-use treatment. Existing AAA separating materials show impressive selective adsorption capability in food samples and chiral mixtures as well as high sensitivity in adsorption sensing. The development of an efficient detection technology for AAA may help in detecting trace AAA in food and in evaluating chiral AAA adulteration in food samples. By exploring the advantages and disadvantages of each type of technology, we provide support for the advancement of the removal and analysis techniques for AAA."

    "title": "Recommendations on phenylketonuria in Turkey.",
    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU), is an autosomal recessive disease leading to the conversion defect of phenylalanine (Phe) into tyrosine. Severe neurocognitive and behavioral outcomes are observed in untreated cases. The present paper aims to review clinical experiences and expert recommendations in diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of pediatric PKU patients in Turkey. Two advisory board meetings were held in the year 2016 and 2017 with contributions of four leading experts in this field, and an online update meeting was held for final decisions about statements, and conclusions in January 2021. Considering management gaps in diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of PKU, discussion points are defined. The Committee members then reviewed the Turkish and general literature and the final statements were formulated. The diagnostic cut-off for dried blood spots should remain at 2 mg/dl. Treatment cut-off value is acceptable at 6 mg/dl. Compliance with an ideal follow-up list is strongly recommended. Total protein intake should not be limited. Age-related safe levels of protein intake should be encouraged with an additional 40% from L-amino acids supplements, a 20% compensatory factor to account for the digestibility and utilization of amino acids from the supplement, and a further 20% compensation to optimize Phe control. Cognitive impairment and intelligence quotient evaluations should be performed at least twice before 3 years of age. In pregnant women, the target Phe level should be < 5 mg/dl, and they should be followed-up weekly in the first trimester, then every 2 weeks after organogenesis. Novel pharmacological treatments are promising, but some of them have limitations for our country. Early diagnosis and treatment initiation; determination and standardization of diagnostic and treatment thresholds; treatment modalities and follow-up parameters are significant steps in treating PKU in the long term. PKU follow-up is a dynamic process with uncertainties and differences in clinical practice."

    "abstract": "Cystic fibrosis, phenylketonuria, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, and sensorineural hearing loss are among the most common autosomal recessive diseases, which require carrier screening. The evaluation of population allele frequencies (AF) of pathogenic variants in genes associated with these conditions and the choice of the best genotyping method are the necessary steps toward development and practical implementation of carrier-screening programs. We performed custom panel genotyping of 3821 unrelated participants from two Russian population representative samples and three patient groups using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and next generation sequencing (NGS). The custom panel included 115 known pathogenic variants in the <i>CFTR</i>, <i>PAH</i>, <i>SERPINA1</i>, and <i>GJB2</i> genes. Overall, 38 variants were detected. The comparison of genotyping platforms revealed the following advantages of real-time PCR: relatively low cost, simple genotyping data analysis, and easier detection of large indels, while NGS showed better accuracy of variants identification and capability for detection of additional pathogenic variants in adjacent regions. A total of 23 variants had significant differences in estimated AF comparing with non-Finnish Europeans from gnomAD. This study provides new AF data for variants associated with the studied disorders and the comparison of genotyping methods for carrier screening."

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a common, autosomal recessive inborn error of metabolism caused by PAH gene variants. After routine genetic analysis methods were applied, approximately 5% of PKU patients were still not diagnosed with a definite genotype. In this study, for the first time, we identified PKU patients with unknown genotypes via single-gene full-length sequencing. The detection rate of PKU genotype increased from 94.6 to 99.4%, an increase of approximately 5%. The variants c.1199 + 502A > T and 1065 + 241C > A were found at a high frequency in Chinese PKU patients. Our study suggest that single-gene full-length sequencing is a rapid, efficient and cost-effective tool to improve the genotype detection rate of PKU patients. Moreover, we provides additional case data to support pathogenicity of deep intronic variants in PAH."

This study investigated parents´ knowledge about PKU and its affecting factors. The study group consisted of 62 parents of PKU patients. data were collected using a ready-made questionnaire on sociodemographic characteristics, PKU and dietary treatment. Total knowledge score (KS) was calculated by giving 5 points for each correct answer. the study included 34 mothers and 28 fathers; 90.3% of patients were diagnosed during the newborn screening program, 6.5% between ages 1 and 2, and 3.2% at age 6 or after. Among all, 38.7% presented to their follow-up appointments with their mothers, 61.3% with both their parents and none with their father alone. Mothers answered all questions more accurately than fathers. Mothers´ and fathers´ mean KSs were 73.97 ± 12.72 and 53.04 ± 22.25, respectively. The highest KS was obtained among parents whose children were 13 years of age or older. the presence of another family member, parents´ education level, working status and professional qualifications, previous training on PKU and family´s economic status were the affecting factors. Creating a PKU dietary plan requires knowledge and diligence. Patients and their parents should be periodically informed about the disease and dietary treatment in order to increase their level of knowledge."

    "title": "Genetic etiology and clinical challenges of phenylketonuria.",
    "abstract": "This review discusses the epidemiology, pathophysiology, genetic etiology, and management of phenylketonuria (PKU). PKU, an autosomal recessive disease, is an inborn error of phenylalanine (Phe) metabolism caused by pathogenic variants in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene. The prevalence of PKU varies widely among ethnicities and geographic regions, affecting approximately 1 in 24,000 individuals worldwide. Deficiency in the PAH enzyme or, in rare cases, the cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin results in high blood Phe concentrations, causing brain dysfunction. Untreated PKU, also known as PAH deficiency, results in severe and irreversible intellectual disability, epilepsy, behavioral disorders, and clinical features such as acquired microcephaly, seizures, psychological signs, and generalized hypopigmentation of skin (including hair and eyes). Severe phenotypes are classic PKU, and less severe forms of PAH deficiency are moderate PKU, mild PKU, mild hyperphenylalaninaemia (HPA), or benign HPA. Early diagnosis and intervention must start shortly after birth to prevent major cognitive and neurological effects. Dietary treatment, including natural protein restriction and Phe-free supplements, must be used to maintain blood Phe concentrations of 120-360 μmol/L throughout the life span. Additional treatments include the casein glycomacropeptide (GMP), which contains very limited aromatic amino acids and may improve immunological function, and large neutral amino acid (LNAA) supplementation to prevent plasma Phe transport into the brain. The synthetic BH4 analog, sapropterin hydrochloride (i.e., Kuvan®, BioMarin), is another potential treatment that activates residual PAH, thus decreasing Phe concentrations in the blood of PKU patients. Moreover, daily subcutaneous injection of pegylated Phe ammonia-lyase (i.e., pegvaliase; PALYNZIQ®, BioMarin) has promised gene therapy in recent clinical trials, and mRNA approaches are also being studied."

    "abstract": "Patients with phenylketonuria (PKU) must maintain a lifelong natural protein-restricted diet to prevent neuro-cognitive damage. Early diagnosis is established with newborn screening, with diet subsequently controlled by regular phenylalanine (Phe) monitoring. During the COVID-19 pandemic, significant lockdown measures were introduced that may have influenced the above. To establish whether the diagnosis was delayed in neonates during the pandemic. In addition, metabolic control was further assessed during the COVID-19 pandemic era (CE) compared to the same period a year prior (non-COVID-19 era, NCE). The lockdown periods (LD) were also compared with unrestricted periods (URP). Six neonates born during the CE and eight neonates born during NCE were included in the newborn screening analysis. Seventy-two classical PKU patients aged 2-18 years and categorized as children (2-12 years; 51 patients) and adolescents (>13 years; 21 patients) were included in the metabolic control analysis. The frequency of dried blood spot (DBS) sampling and Phe levels were assessed according to the different periods. There was no diagnostic or therapeutic delay in reaching the recommended Phe range in neonates born during CE compared to those born in NCE (median [interquartile range, IQR]: 23.5 [22.5-24] vs. 22 [18.0-27] days, p = NS). The cumulative DBS sampling frequency in children increased by 9.9% in the CE while no change was noted in the adolescent group. The median Phe level increased significantly in both age groups in the CE, but remained within the recommended target range. During CE, changes in Phe levels differed in the two age groups: children had the highest median Phe in the second lockdown period (LD2), while the adolescents had an increased Phe in URP.There were significant negative correlations between DBS sampling frequencies and Phe levels in both age groups in NCE (children: r - 0.43, <i>p</i> = 0.002; adolescents <i>r</i> = -0.37, <i>p</i> = 0.012), and in adolescents in CE (<i>r</i> = -0.62, <i>p</i> = 0.006). The pandemic did not impact newborn metabolic screening. The increased frequency of DBS sampling in CE and good target Phe levels suggest a better compliance in a very sensitive period. Since many factors may impact metabolic control in the different age groups, further studies are needed to analyse their respective role."

    "abstract": "ADHD is a common behavioral syndrome with a heritability of 70-80%. Genome wide sequencing and association studies indicate that ADHD risk variants are distributed across a wide range of allele frequencies and relative risks. Several common single nucleotide variants (SNPs) have been identified that increase the risk of ADHD with a few percent. Many of the reported risk genes and copy number variants are shared with other neuropsychiatric disorders. Moreover, ADHD often coexists with common or rare somatic diseases, including rare Mendelian neurometabolic diseases that can affect normal brain development and function. Some genetic/metabolic syndromes masquerading as common ADHD may lead to irreversible brain damage if not properly identified and treated during early childhood. As ADHD is such a heterogeneous condition in terms of severity, clinical features and most probably also underlying biology, it is crucial to offer individualized treatments. Recent progress in ADHD genetics is reviewed, prospects of using this information for targeted pharmacotherapy are discussed and critical knowledge gaps are identified. It is suggested that genome guided therapies could be introduced gradually, starting with rare ADHD syndromes with highly penetrant risk genes. Routine diagnostic application of whole exome or whole genome sequencing combined with metabolomic screening, and brain imaging may be needed in cases with suspected neurometabolic disorders. Identification and treatment of ADHD patients with defined neurometabolic aberrations could be a first step toward genome guided personalized treatment of ADHD. Possibly, screening for relevant biomarkers may gradually be implemented to guide treatment choices in larger patient groups."

    "abstract": "To explore and analyze the influencing factors of tetrahydrobiopterin therapy in patients with phenylketonuria. 86 children with phenylketonuria (PKU) diagnosed and treated in our hospital from February 2019 to September 2021 were randomly enrolled. All the children underwent coenzyme hydroxybiopterin and urinary pterin spectrum analysis, and the children with deficiency received gene mutation testing. The results of urine pterin analysis showed that 82 patients had higher urinary N and B contents than the normal reference values, with the N/B slightly higher than the normal B% within the normal range. 4 patients had extremely high urinary N/B and B% <5% and were diagnosed as BH4 deficiency caused by 6-pyruvoyl-tetrahydropterin synthase (PTPS) deficiency, and a combined stress test was performed. The blood Phe level was (720-1200) <i>μ</i>mol/L 3 h after Phe loading, and the blood Phe concentration decreased to (120-240) <i>μ</i>mol/L 4-6 h after oral administration of 7.5 mg/kg BH4 tablet. After one week of treatment, the blood Phe concentration decreased significantly to 239 ± 173 <i>μ</i>mol/L, with a decrease rate of 52.14 ± 25.28%. It shows that the application of tetrahydrobiopterin intervention therapy is effective in patients with PKU. The results of the full-length cDNA analysis of the PTPS gene showed that a total of 4 gene mutations were found. A C ⟶ T substitution occurred at the 259th base, and the 87th proline (Pro) in the coding region was converted to serine (Ser) (P87S). G ⟶ A substitution at base 286 converts aspartic acid (Asp) at position 96 of the coding region to asparagine (Asn) (D96N). A ⟶ G substitution occurs at the 155th base to convert asparagine (Asn) at position 52 of the coding region to serine (Ser) (N52S). G ⟶ C substitution occurs at the 430th base to convert glycine at position 144 (Gly) to arginine (Arg) (G144R). G144R is a new mutation type. The gene mutation types of the 4 patients were P87S/D96N, N52S/G144R, D96N/P87S, and P87S/P87S, all of which were from their parents, which conformed to the law of autosomal recessive inheritance. PKU is caused by the defect of phenylalanine hydroxylase activity in children, which causes phenylalanine metabolism disorder, and tetrahydrobiopterin intervention therapy can affect the activity of phenylalanine hydroxylase, increase the decline rate of blood Phe, significantly reduce the level of phenylalanine in children, and promote intellectual recovery. The dose of tetrahydrobiopterin should be tailored, with small doses for mild phenotypes and long-term treatment using even smaller doses."

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an autosomal recessive inherited disorder of phenylalanine metabolism resulting from a deficiency of phenylalanine hydroxylase. The aim of this study was to evaluate the dental status and periodontal health of PKU patients in Latvia. Forty-five PKU patients and age/sex-matched controls were recruited for this cross-sectional study. Their anamnestic data, periodontal health and dental status were assessed by one experienced dentist. Dental and periodontal clinical evaluation revealed that the median number of filled teeth was significantly smaller among PKU patients compared to the control group (p=0.021). PKU patients had a significantly larger median number of carious teeth than their healthy counterparts (p<0.001). Significant differences between the PKU and control groups were observed for several oral hygiene indices (p<0.001): Silness-Löe plaque index, OR=29.3 (95% CI: 3.7-232.4); CPITN index, OR=35.2 (95% CI: 4.5-278.3); Greene-Vermillion index, OR=10.2 (95% CI: 2.8-38.0); calculus removal necessity, OR=12.3 (95% CI: 3.3-45.4). Dental status and periodontal health of PKU patients was found to be significantly inferior compared to healthy controls. This is likely due to the regular consumption of PKU formula and the difficulties which mentally and/or physically disabled PKU patients experience with their oral hygiene. To prevent tooth decay and periodontal disease, PKU patients should visit a professional oral hygienist every three to six months. Furthermore, they should adopt the habit of rinsing their mouth with water immediately after consuming PKU formula to counteract the acidity in their oral cavity."

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a rare genetic condition caused by inborn error(s) in the gene for the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. Resulting loss of phenylalanine (Phe) metabolism requires strict dietary therapy and/or medication to prevent toxic accumulation of Phe. Novel investigational therapies, including gene therapies that aim to address underlying causes of PKU, are now entering clinical trials. However, perceptions of this technology in the PKU community have not been assessed. We conducted a qualitative survey recruiting adult patients, caregivers, and patient advocates from the US and 3 EU countries to assess the impact of living with PKU and the perceptions of gene therapy. Telephone interviews were conducted for up to 60 min following a standardized discussion guide. Interviewers classified each participant by their level of knowledge regarding gene therapy as either: low (little or no prior awareness); moderate (awareness of gene therapy as a concept in PKU); or high (working knowledge of gene therapy, e.g., vectors). In total, 33 participants were recruited (patients, n = 24; caregivers, n = 5; advocates, n = 4). The patient sample was well balanced among age groups, sex, and US/EU geographies. The participants' experiences and burden of living with PKU were largely negative, characterized by frustrations with current management consistent with prior reports. Most participants (n = 18/33) were identified as displaying moderate gene-therapy knowledge, 10/33 as displaying high knowledge, and 5/33 as displaying low knowledge. Both positive and negative perceptions were observed; positive perceptions were often linked to \"hope\" that gene therapy may represent a cure, whereas negative perceptions were linked to the \"uncertainty\" of outcomes. High knowledge of gene therapy appeared to trend with negative perceptions; 7/10 participants from this group reported high levels of concern over gene therapy. In contrast, participants who displayed low knowledge reported low (n = 3/5) or moderate (n = 2/5) concern, with predominantly positive perceptions. These data highlight the need for education around the theoretical risk:benefit profile of gene therapy. Despite current unknowns around gene therapy, our study demonstrates the important role of healthcare providers as educators who can use available data to provide balanced information to patients and caregivers."

Cross-sectional survey.Participants/setting:online survey conducted in December 2020 of 66 RDs who treat patients with IMDs in the United States and Canada.Main outcome measures:the survey focused on personal demographics, clinic characteristics, institutional feeding protocols for infants with IMDs, confidence in working with breastfeeding parents of infants with IMDs, and knowledge about breastfeeding with questions derived from the Iowa Infant Feeding Attitudes Scale.Statistical analysis performed:.Fisher's exact test was used for comparisons. Most RDs were confident or very confident in their ability to provide nutritional guidance for breastfeeding infants with IMDs. Half of the participants reported that they had received training on breastfeeding of infants of IMDs. For infants with phenylketonuria (PKU), most RDs include breastfeeding as part of nutritional management. Breastfeeding is less likely to be used in the management of infants with other aminoacidopathies and fatty acid oxidation disorders. Use of measured expressed breastmilk was preferred, including for aminoacidopathies other than PKU, organic acidemias, and fatty acid oxidation disorders. Knowledge about breastfeeding varied. Less than half of RDs referred mothers to a lactation specialist somewhat regularly or frequently. Our survey found variation in experience, training, and use of breastfeeding-related nutritional management protocols in IMDs. A lack of formal training programs for the nutritional management of IMDs may account for some of this variation. Future research, including the collection of more detailed disorder-specific data, could help contribute to the development of clinical practice guidelines."

Parents take primary responsibility for treatment monitoring and experience worry and fear about their child's health status. Quantitative evidence on parental psychological factors which may influence the HrQoL of patients with IT-IEM are sparse to non-existent. In this multicenter survey study 50 parents of IT-IEM patients (ages 5-19) assessed the severity of their child's disease, reported on caregiver burden, and proxy-rated their child's HrQoL. Additionally, 35 patient self-reports on HrQoL were obtained (<i>n</i> = 16 female patients, <i>n</i> = 19 male patients). Multiple linear regressions were conducted to examine the predictive power of child age, sex, medical diagnosis type (acute / non-acute), parental perceived disease severity and caregiver burden on patients' HrQoL. Mediation analyses were used to investigate the relation of caregiver burden and parental ratings of disease severity with patients' HrQoL. Significant regression models for self-reported [<i>F</i>(5,34) = 10.752, <i>p</i> < .001, <i>R</i> <sup><i>2</i></sup> adj.<sup>.</sup> = 0.59] and parent proxy reported HrQoL [<i>F</i>(5,49) = 20.513, <i>p</i> < .001, <i>R</i> <sup><i>2</i></sup> adj.<sup>.</sup> = 0.67] emerged. High caregiver burden and perceived disease severity predicted significantly lower patient self- and proxy-reported HrQoL while type of diagnosis (acute versus non-acute) did not. Female sex predicted significantly lower self-reported HrQoL. High caregiver burden was the mediating factor between high perceived severity of the child's disease and lower proxy- by parent rated HrQoL. Detecting elevated burden of care and providing support for parents seems crucial to prevent adverse consequences for their children's HrQoL. Intervention studies are needed, to assess which support programs are most efficient."

In this study, we inspect 2729 publicly available ancient genomes (100 BP-52000 BP) for the presence of pathogenic variants in 32643 disease-associated loci. We base our subsequent analyses on 19 variants in seven genes-PAH, EDAR, F11, HBB, LRRK2, SLC12A6 and MAOA, associated with monogenic diseases and with well-established pathogenic impact in contemporary populations. We determine 230 homozygote genotypes of these variants in the screened 2729 ancient DNA samples. Eleven of these are in the PAH gene (126 ancient samples in total), a gene associated with the condition phenylketonuria in modern populations. The variants examined seem to show varying dynamics over the last 10000 years, some exhibiting a single upsurge in frequency and subsequently disappearing, while others maintain high frequency levels (compared to contemporary population frequencies) over long time periods. The geographic distribution and age of the ancient DNA samples with established pathogenic variants suggests multiple independent origin of these variants. Comparison of estimates of the geographic prevalence of these variants from ancient and contemporary data show discontinuity in their prevalence and supports their recurrent emergence. The oldest samples in which a variant is established might give an indication of their age and place origin, and an EDAR gene pathogenic variant was established in a sample estimated to be 33210-32480 calBCE. Knowledge about the historical prevalence of variants causing monogenic disorders provides insight on their emergence, dynamics and spread."

    "abstract": "This systematic review study aims to evaluate the cognitive function of patients with mild hyperphenylalaninemia (mHPA) without treatment. A systematic literature search was done from the 1st of May to the 30th of July in 2021 on published studies. The search strategy was ((hyperphenylalaninemia) OR (phenylketonuria) AND (cognition)). We use PubMed, Scopus, and the Web of Science databases. Studies which reported their findings regarding the cognitive function of patients with mHPA (screening serum phenylalanine > 120 and < 600 μmol/L) were included and reviewed. From initially retrieved 2805 studies, finally, 15 studies (10 on untreated patients with Phe levels below 360 μmol/L, 7 on untreated patients with Phe levels between 360 and 600 μmol/L, four 120-600 μmol/L) were selected. Most of the studies used the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for IQ evaluation, two (2/15) of them used the Stanford-Binet test and two used both tests. Four studies have reported a worse cognitive outcome compared to the control group, and in one study, relative defects in attention and working memory were reported. Other studies have reported normal IQ levels and no significant cognitive defects. It is suggested that Phe levels between 120 and 360 μmol/L are generally safe. Some studies showed that untreated patients with higher levels might show some degrees of cognitive impairment. In conclusion, current knowledge is insufficient to state that treatment is not required for HPA patients to preserve their cognitive status, especially in patients with Phe levels of 360-600 μmol/L. Further studies with a larger sample size and standardized cognitive function evaluation tools are needed."

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is the most common inborn error of amino acid metabolism caused by an inherited deficiency in L-phenylalanine-4-hydroxylase (PAH) activity. It is usually controlled by diet and monitored regularly with markers, as PKU is not curable. However, conventional methods for target biomarker analysis are invasive and labor intensive. Here, we report a rapid and sensitive, mimetic immunoassay for detecting phenylpyruvate (PhPY) based on stimuli-responsive upconversion nanoparticles with an inner filter effect (IFE). The strong and specific binding of PhPY and Fe<sup>3+</sup> forms a complex with maximum absorption at approximately 640 nm. Upon the addition of LiYF<sub>4</sub>:Er,Ho@LiYF<sub>4</sub> UCNPs (maximum emission at 699 nm), the inner filter effect is triggered along with a concurrent decrease in fluorescence. The proposed method demonstrates ultra sensitivity with a detection limit of 79.63 μg L<sup>-1</sup>, which is superior to most reported methods, thereby enabling phenylpyruvate assays on human urine."

    "abstract": "The authors discuss the need for newborn screening in the context of the migration policy of the European Union, and particularly, the European Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund. The authors searched scholarly databases (Pubmed, Scopus, Google scholar) and grey literature (LexEuropa, Policy reports) to identify original peer-reviewed research examining the migration to the European Union and the provision of healthcare to infants born to refugees and immigrant mothers. Resources in language different from English, French, German and Greek were not taken into consideration. Every year, a large number of refugees and immigrants from sub-Saharan Africa and Middle East countries travel to and enter in Europe. It has been estimated that two thirds of those seeking asylum are women and children. Many of these children have been born on the way to Europe or in migrant camps. Essential newborns' health screening is not accessible in most cases. Congenital conditions such as hypothyroidism and phenylketonuria may remain untreated, and once these infants are diagnosed, the organic damage could be irreversible. Prolonged necessary hospitalisation might be out of consideration at a time when clinics and hospitals are overstrained with COVID-19 patients. It is essential to ensure that newborn screening will be performed in a timely and evidence-based manner as well as that the information will be communicated between hospitals and within countries' health networks. In order to achieve these goals interdisciplinary and international technical and logistical collaboration are required."

Neurocognitive and behavioral outcomes have always featured in PKU research but received less attention in TT1 research. This study aimed to investigate and compare neurocognitive, behavioral, and social outcomes of treated TT1 and PKU patients. We included 33 TT1 patients (mean age 11.24 years; 16 male), 31 PKU patients (mean age 10.84; 14 male), and 58 age- and gender-matched healthy controls (mean age 10.82 years; 29 male). IQ (Wechsler-subtests), executive functioning (the Behavioral Rating Inventory of Executive Functioning), mental health (the Achenbach-scales), and social functioning (the Social Skills Rating System) were assessed. Results of TT1 patients, PKU patients, and healthy controls were compared using Kruskal-Wallis tests with post-hoc Mann-Whitney U tests. TT1 patients showed a lower IQ and poorer executive functioning, mental health, and social functioning compared to healthy controls and PKU patients. PKU patients did not differ from healthy controls regarding these outcome measures. Relatively poor outcomes for TT1 patients were particularly evident for verbal IQ, BRIEF dimensions \"working memory\", \"plan and organize\" and \"monitor\", ASEBA dimensions \"social problems\" and \"attention problems\", and for the SSRS \"assertiveness\" scale (all p values <0.001). To conclude, TT1 patients showed cognitive impairments on all domains studied, and appeared to be significantly more affected than PKU patients. More attention should be paid to investigating and monitoring neurocognitive outcome in TT1 and research should focus on explaining the underlying pathophysiological mechanism."

    "abstract": "Phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) catalyzes the deamination of phenylalanine to cinnamic acid and ammonia. It plays a crucial role in the formation of secondary metabolites through the phenylpropanoid pathway. Recently there has been growing interest in exploring the biochemical properties of PAL for its clinical and commercial applications. PAL as a key component has been used in metabolic engineering and synthetic biology. Due to its high substrate specificity and catalytic efficacy, PAL has opened a new area of interest in the biomedical field. PAL has been frequently used in the enzyme replacement therapy of phenylketonuria, cancer treatment and microbial production of l-phe the precursor of noncalorific sweetener aspartame (Methyl L-α-aspartyl-l-phenylalaninate), antimicrobial and health supplements. PAL occurs in few plants, fungi, bacteria, and cyanobacteria. The present investigation is a preliminary study in which an attempt has been made for the isolation, partial purification, and biochemical characterization of PAL (crude and partially purified) from Spirulina CPCC-695. Partially purified PAL exhibited higher enzymatic activity and protein content than the crude enzyme. Molecular weight of the crude and partially purified PAL was ~ 66 kDa. The optimum temperature and pH for PAL activity was observed as 30 ℃ and 8.0 respectively. l-Phe was the most preferred substrate (100 mM) whereas gallic acid showed maximum inhibition of PAL activity. Enzyme kinetics suggested good catalytic efficacy of the PAL enzyme and affinity towards substrate. Both the enzyme (crude and partially purified) showed less than 5% haemolysis suggesting the biocompatible nature of PAL."

    "abstract": "Phenylalanine hydroxylase enzyme defects result in a hereditary metabolic disorder called phenylketonuria. Sapropterin (tetrahydrobiopterin) is one of the treatment strategies for this disorder. Even though a correlation between genotype and BH4 responsiveness was established by earlier studies, a subset of mutations often presented inconsistent responses and/or phenotypes. Different genetic background is one of the potential reasons for this fact. In this study, the genotype of a total of 34 PAH deficient patients from Khorasan-Razavi providence in the north-east of Iran was obtained. Among this patients, 21 individuals took the 24 h and 48 h BH4 loading test and if the result was positive, their Phenylalanine tolerance was assessed. It is the first study of its type in patients from Iran to evaluate genotype role in predicting the most probable responsive individuals. The known pathogenic variant p.R169P and the novel variant p. Leu72_Asp75delinsTyr were first classified as responsive.Seven genotypes were reported as responsive for the first time. All patients carrying at least one pathogenic variant, which was previously reported as BH4 responsive, respond to BH4. Three patients with p.L48S, p.R261Q and p.A309V pathogenic variants were exceptions. There was no certain statistical correlation between genotype and response. Genotype and phenotype were significantly correlated and majority of patients with mild phenotype carried at least one non-null pathogenic variant. In Khorasan-Razavi province of Iran, patients with at least one non-null mutation are most probable to demonstrate mild phenotype and respond to BH4 phenotype."

Interpreting food labels, calculating protein intake, and determining food suitability are complex and confusing tasks. A mobile multi-media low-protein diet app was developed to guide food choice, label interpretation, and protein calculation. ‘PKU Bite’® includes >1100 specialist and regular low-protein foods, is colour-coded for suitability, and features a protein calculator. A 12-week randomised controlled trial assessed app efficacy, compared with written/pictorial material, in 60 parents/caregivers of children with PKU, aged 1−16 years, and 21 adolescents with PKU. Questionnaires examined self-efficacy and label-reading knowledge; food records evaluated natural-protein intake, compared with prescriptions. There was no difference between groups in label-reading knowledge or self-efficacy, but there was a trend for improved accuracy of dietary protein calculation, when using the app (baseline/12-weeks: app 35%/48%; control 39%/35%). Parents of children <10 years of age (median 5.5 years), were most likely to use the app to check the phenylalanine/protein content of a food or to verify suitability of foods. Whilst the app was popular (43%), so too was contacting the dietitian (43%), using written/pictorial information (24%), or using social media (18%). This is the first dietary app for PKU to be studied in a systematic way as well as validated by healthcare professionals. It is a useful adjunct to existing resources and will be a valuable tool for educating parents of younger children."

    "abstract": "To present our experience using a multiomic approach, which integrates genetic and biochemical testing as a first-line diagnostic tool for patients with inherited metabolic disorders (IMDs). A cohort of 3720 patients from 62 countries was tested using a panel including 206 genes with single nucleotide and copy number variant (SNV/CNV) detection, followed by semi-automatic variant filtering and reflex biochemical testing (25 assays). In 1389 patients (37%), a genetic diagnosis was achieved. Within this cohort, the highest diagnostic yield was obtained for patients from Asia (57.5%, mainly from Pakistan). Overall, 701 pathogenic/likely pathogenic unique SNVs and 40 CNVs were identified. In 620 patients, the result of the biochemical tests guided variant classification and reporting. Top five diagnosed diseases were: Gaucher disease, Niemann-Pick disease type A/B, phenylketonuria, mucopolysaccharidosis type I, and Wilson disease. We show that integrated genetic and biochemical testing facilitated the decision on clinical relevance of the variants and led to a high diagnostic yield (37%), which is comparable to exome/genome sequencing. More importantly, up to 43% of these patients (n = 610) could benefit from medical treatments (e.g., enzyme replacement therapy). This multiomic approach constitutes a unique and highly effective tool for the genetic diagnosis of IMDs."

A method based on high-performance liquid chromatography and diode array detection was developed and validated. Then, overall uncertainty was estimated by the bottom-up approach. Applying the weighted least squares regression method suggested good linearity with coefficient of determinations ≥ 0.9960. The limits of detection were calculated between 0.01 and 0.28 μg/mL. The most repetitive recovery values were obtained in the range of 91-108%, with RSDs ≤ 15%. The expanded uncertainties were below 20% for most amino acids. The contributions of linear regression and repeatability are two main factors in estimating overall uncertainty. The results offer this method as a simple and easy procedure for analyzing free amino acids in seven powdered medical foods designed for phenylketonuria, maple syrup urine disease, methylmalonic, and propionic acidemia."

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a genetic disorder affecting around 1 in 12,000 live births (1), caused by a mutation in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene in the liver which facilitates the catabolism of phenylalanine (Phe). Without a functional copy of PAH, levels of Phe in the blood and tissues rise, resulting in potentially life-threatening damage to the central nervous system. (2) Treatment options for PKU are limited, and center around adherence to a strict PKU diet that suffers from poor patient compliance. There are two approved drugs available, one of which must be used in conjunction with the PKU diet and another that has serious immunological side effects. Here we demonstrate that the LUNAR® delivery technology is capable of delivering mRNA for a replacement enzyme, the bacterial phenylalanine ammonia lyase (avPAL), into the hepatic tissue of a PKU mouse, and that the enzyme is capable of metabolizing Phe and reducing serum levels of Phe for more than five days post-transfection. We further demonstrate the ability of LUNAR to deliver a plant-derived PAL protein with a similar impact on the level of serum Phe. Taken together these results demonstrate both the capability of LUNAR for the targeted delivery of PAL mRNA into hepatic tissue in vivo, replacing the defective PAH protein and successfully reducing serum Phe levels, thereby addressing the underlying cause of PKU symptoms. Secondly, that plant-based PAL proteins are a viable alternative to bacterial avPAL to reduce the immunogenic response."

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a metabolic inherited disorder in which transition from infancy to adult care is particularly difficult and not sufficiently regulated. According to the scientific literature, only few medical centers offer healthcare assistance for adult patients with PKU that are therefore still treated in pediatric settings. This generates psychological, emotional, and organizational discomfort among patients, leading them to discontinue the follow-up. European guidelines and national consensus documents underline this unmet need and the lack of practical recommendations for a structured transitional pathway in PKU. The aim of this review and expert opinion is to propose good practices for managing the transition period of PKU patients, based on the literature and the experience of a panel of Italian experts in PKU. The consensus of the experts was obtained through the administration of three rounds of surveys and one structured interview. The result is the first proposal of a pathway for an efficient transition of PKU patients. Key steps of the proposed pathway are the \"a priori\" planning involving the pediatric and adult teams, the acceptance of the patient and his/her family to the process, the preliminary definition of appropriate spaces in the structure, the organization of meetings with the joint team, and the appointment of a transition coordinator. For the first time, the involvement of decision makers and patient associations is proposed."

In a mouse model, it has been suggested to exert a prebiotic role on beneficial gut bacteria. In this study, we performed the 16S rRNA sequencing to evaluate the effect of 6 months of GMP supplementation on the gut microbiota of nine PKU patients, comparing their bacterial composition and clinical parameters before and after the intervention. GMP seems to be safe from both the microbiological and the clinical point of view. Indeed, we did not observe dramatic changes in the gut microbiota but a specific prebiotic effect on the butyrate-producer <i>Agathobacter</i> spp. and, to a lesser extent, of <i>Subdoligranulum</i>. Clinically, GMP intake did not show a significant impact on both metabolic control, as phenylalanine values were kept below the age target and nutritional parameters. On the other hand, an amelioration of calcium phosphate homeostasis was observed, with an increase in plasmatic vitamin D and a decrease in alkaline phosphatase. Our results suggest GMP as a safe alternative in the PKU diet and its possible prebiotic role on specific taxa without causing dramatic changes in the commensal microbiota."

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a rare metabolic disease caused by variations in a human gene, PAH, encoding phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH), and the enzyme converting the essential amino acid phenylalanine into tyrosine. Many PKU-causing variations compromise the conformational stability of the encoded enzyme, decreasing or abolishing its catalytic activity, and leading to an elevated concentration of phenylalanine in the blood, which is neurotoxic. Several therapeutic approaches have been developed to treat the more severe manifestations of the disorder, but they are either not entirely effective or difficult to adhere to throughout life. In a search for novel pharmacological chaperones to treat PKU, a lead compound was discovered (compound IV) that exhibited promising in vitro and in vivo chaperoning activity on PAH. The structure of the PAH-IV complex has been reported. Here, using alchemical free energy calculations (AFEC) on the structure of the PAH-IV complex, we design a new generation of compound IV-analogues with a higher affinity for the enzyme. Seventeen novel analogues were synthesized, and thermal shift and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) assays were performed to experimentally evaluate their stabilizing effect and their affinity for the enzyme. Most of the new derivatives bind to PAH tighter than lead compound IV and induce a greater thermostabilization of the enzyme upon binding. Importantly, the correspondence between the calculated alchemical binding free energies and the experimentally determined ΔΔ<i>G</i><sub>b</sub> values is excellent, which supports the use of AFEC to design pharmacological chaperones to treat PKU using the X-ray structure of their complexes with the target PAH enzyme."

The most serious symptoms are related to the brain, as intellectual disability, seizure, and microcephaly are commonly found in poorly treated PKU patients and the babies of maternal PKU. However, the mechanism of hyperphenylalaninemia on human neurodevelopment is still unclear. Here we utilized human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cerebral organoids to investigate the neurotoxicity of hyperphenylalaninemia. Cerebral organoids at days 40 or 100 were treated with different concentrations of phenylalanine for 5 days. After phenylalanine treatments, the cerebral organoids displayed alterations in organoid size, induction of apoptosis, and depletion of neural progenitor cells. However, phenylalanine did not have an impact on neurons and glia, including astrocytes, immature oligodendrocytes, and mature oligodendrocytes. Remarkably, a reduction in the thickness of the cortical rosettes and a decrease in myelination at the intermediate zone were inspected with the elevated phenylalanine concentrations. RNA-seq of phenylalanine-treated organoids revealed that gene sets related to apoptosis, p53 signaling pathway, and TNF signaling pathway via NF-kB were enriched in upregulated genes, while those related to cell cycle and amino acid metabolism were enriched in downregulated genes. In addition, there were several microcephaly disease genes, such as ASPM, LMNB1, and CENPE, ranked at the top of the downregulated genes. These findings indicate that phenylalanine exposure may contribute to microcephaly, abnormal cortical expansion, and myelination lesions in the developing human brain."

The only treatment for PKU so far is lifelong dietary intervention to ensure normal human growth and neurodevelopment. However, in adults, low long-term adherence to this type of dietary intervention has been observed. Given the important role of the intestinal microbiota in the process of digestion and disease prevention, probiotics could be a therapeutic strategy to help degrade dietary phenylalanine, reducing its levels before ingestion. Genetically modified probiotics designed as live biotherapeutic agents for the treatment of specific diseases are sophisticated alternative therapeutic strategies. In this review, the focus is on demonstrating what has been elucidated so far about the use of next-generation probiotics as a therapeutic strategy in the treatment of individuals with PKU. The results described in the literature are encouraging and use genetically modified engineered probiotics showing efficacy both in vitro and in vivo. These probiotics appear to be suitable for meeting the unmet need for new drugs for PKU."

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a rare genetic disorder caused by a defect in the metabolism of phenylalanine (Phe). Currently, the most commonly used treatment for PKU is dietary Phe restriction. Problems associated with Phe restricted diets include lack of universal availability, high treatment costs, and reduced adherence to continued treatment with age and finally the development of psychological and neurological problems in a significant proportion of patients despite early start of treatment. One possible approach to decreasing blood Phe level, is inhibition of GI tract absorption of this amino acid. We had previously shown that a Phe selective molecularly imprinted polymer was able to bind Phe in the GI tract and attenuate its plasma concentration. In this work, we used different orally administered Phe selective molecularly imprinted polymer doses in a PKU mouse model to further study the effects of this treatment on biochemical profile and cognitive function in test animals. Treatments started 21 days postnatally. After 3 weeks, brain and plasma amino acid profiles and brain monoaminergic neurotransmitter concentrations were measured. Behavioral profile was also evaluated. Treatment with 2% and 5% Phe selective molecularly imprinted polymer significantly reduced levels of blood Phe in PKU model animals (46% and 48% respectively) meanwhile levels of other amino acids remained unchanged. Brain dopamine concentrations in hippocampus was effectively restored by supplementation of Phe selective molecularly imprinted polymer. Finally, polymer treatment improved locomotor dysfunction in PKU model animals. Our data suggest that the Phe selective molecularly imprinted polymer can be a new candidate for treatment of PKU patients. Take home message: Orally administered Phenylalanine Selective Molecularly Imprinted Polymer is able to inhibit absorption of phenylalanine from the GI tract and may offer a new treatment, in conjunction with dietary restriction, for PKU patients."

Whilst massively parallel sequencing (MPS) allows researchers to screen several loci simultaneously for pathogenic variants, no screening programme uses MPS to uncover the variant spectra of these diseases in the Vietnamese population. Pregnant women (mean age of 32) from across Vietnam attending routine prenatal health checks agreed to participate and had their blood drawn. MPS was used to detect variants in their G6PD, PAH and GALT genes. Of 3259 women screened across Vietnam, 450 (13.8%) carried disease-associated variants for G6PD, PAH and GALT. The prevalence of carriers was 8.9% (291 of 3259) in G6PD and 4.6% (152 of 3259) in PKU, whilst GAL was low at 0.2% (7 of 3259). Two GALT variants, c.593 T > C and c.1034C > A, have rarely been reported. This study highlights the need for routine carrier screening, where women give blood whilst receiving routine prenatal care, in Vietnam. The use of MPS is suitable for screening multiple variants, allowing for identifying rare pathogenic variants. The data from our study will inform policymakers in constructing cost-effective genetic metabolic carrier screening programmes."

Twenty children with PKU aged 11−16 years, 30 parents of children with PKU aged 4−10 years, and 50 age/gender-matched control children were recruited. To test reproducibility, FFQs were completed twice with a mean interval of 5 weeks (range: 4−10). In order to test validity, FFQs were compared with five 24-h dietary recalls with a mean interval of 10 days (range: 6−18). Energy and macronutrient intake and quantity/week of individual food items were calculated and compared. There was good reproducibility for the FFQ with macronutrient correlations r > 0.6 and good validity data with most correlations r > 0.5. Bland−Altman plots for reproducibility and validity showed mean levels close to 0 and usually within 2 standard deviations. FFQ comparisons of PKU and control groups identified expected differences in % energy from macronutrients (PKU vs. control: carbohydrate 59% vs. 51%, fat 26% vs. 33%, protein 15% vs. 16%). This FFQ for PKU produced comparable data to repeated dietary recalls and is a valid tool for collecting data on habitual food and nutrient intake.

    "title": "Deubiquitinase USP19 enhances phenylalanine hydroxylase protein stability and its enzymatic activity.",
    "abstract": "Phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) is the key enzyme in phenylalanine metabolism, deficiency of which is associated with the most common metabolic phenotype of phenylketonuria (PKU) and hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA). A bulk of PKU disease-associated missense mutations in the PAH gene have been studied, and the consequence of each PAH variant vary immensely. Prior research established that PKU-associated variants possess defects in protein folding with reduced cellular stability leading to rapid degradation. However, recent evidence revealed that PAH tetramers exist as a mixture of resting state and activated state whose transition depends upon the phenylalanine concentration and certain PAH variants that fail to modulate the structural equilibrium are associated with PKU disease. Collectively, these findings framed our understanding of the complex genotype-phenotype correlation in PKU. In the current study, we substantiate a link between PAH protein stability and its degradation by the ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation system. Here, we provide an evidence that PAH protein undergoes ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, which can be reversed by deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs). We identified USP19 as a novel DUB that regulates PAH protein stability. We found that ectopic expression of USP19 increased PAH protein level, whereas depletion of USP19 promoted PAH protein degradation. Our study indicates that USP19 interacts with PAH and prevents polyubiquitination of PAH subsequently extending the half-life of PAH protein. Finally, the increase in the level of PAH protein by the deubiquitinating activity of USP19 resulted in enhanced metabolic function of PAH. In summary, our study identifies the role of USP19 in regulating PAH protein stability and promotes its metabolic activity. Graphical highlights 1. E3 ligase Cdh1 promotes PAH protein degradation leading to insufficient cellular amount of PAH causing PKU. 2. A balance between E3 ligase and DUB is important to regulate the proteostasis of PAH. 3. USP19 deubiquitinates and stabilizes PAH further protecting it from rapid degradation. 4. USP19 increases the enzymatic activity of PAH, thus maintaining normal Phe levels."

    "title": "Clinical diagnosis of metabolic disorders using untargeted metabolomic profiling and disease-specific networks learned from profiling data.",
    "abstract": "Untargeted metabolomics is a global molecular profiling technology that can be used to screen for inborn errors of metabolism (IEMs). Metabolite perturbations are evaluated based on current knowledge of specific metabolic pathway deficiencies, a manual diagnostic process that is qualitative, has limited scalability, and is not equipped to learn from accumulating clinical data. Our purpose was to improve upon manual diagnosis of IEMs in the clinic by developing novel computational methods for analyzing untargeted metabolomics data. We employed CTD, an automated computational diagnostic method that \"connects the dots\" between metabolite perturbations observed in individual metabolomics profiling data and modules identified in disease-specific metabolite co-perturbation networks learned from prior profiling data. We also extended CTD to calculate distances between any two individuals (CTDncd) and between an individual and a disease state (CTDdm), to provide additional network-quantified predictors for use in diagnosis. We show that across 539 plasma samples, CTD-based network-quantified measures can reproduce accurate diagnosis of 16 different IEMs, including adenylosuccinase deficiency, argininemia, argininosuccinic aciduria, aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase deficiency, cerebral creatine deficiency syndrome type 2, citrullinemia, cobalamin biosynthesis defect, GABA-transaminase deficiency, glutaric acidemia type 1, maple syrup urine disease, methylmalonic aciduria, ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency, phenylketonuria, propionic acidemia, rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata, and the Zellweger spectrum disorders. Our approach can be used to supplement information from biochemical pathways and has the potential to significantly enhance the interpretation of variants of uncertain significance uncovered by exome sequencing. CTD, CTDdm, and CTDncd can serve as an essential toolset for biological interpretation of untargeted metabolomics data that overcomes limitations associated with manual diagnosis to assist diagnosticians in clinical decision-making. By automating and quantifying the interpretation of perturbation patterns, CTD can improve the speed and confidence by which clinical laboratory directors make diagnostic and treatment decisions, while automatically improving performance with new case data."

    "abstract": "Lifelong dietary treatment remains the mainstay for many with phenylketonuria (PKU); however, adherence is known to reduce with age. It remains unclear whether knowledge and perceptions of the PKU diet amongst adults with PKU influence dietary behaviours. A nationwide questionnaire survey was performed to investigate the knowledge and perceptions, and associated diet behaviours of adults with PKU in the UK. The survey was sent to adults with PKU under the care of the host hospital and members of the National Society of PKU. One hundred and thirty-seven respondents (n = 78 females, 56.9%) completed the survey with a mean age of 34 years and 4 months (16-65 years). Sixty (43.8%) respondents had always followed a PKU diet, 39 (28.5%) returned to diet and 35 (25.5%) were off diet. Overall mean ± SD knowledge score was 75.2% ± 13.4%, with significantly higher scores for knowledge of PKU (80.7% ± 16.2%) compared to knowledge specifically of the PKU diet (72.6% ± 14.5%, p < 0.001). Knowledge was associated with dietary adherence. Respondents who always followed a PKU diet had similar knowledge to those who returned to diet, whereas respondents off diet had significantly lower scores. Perception of the diet was not a predictor of dietary adherence, with the exception of whether patients had concerns for their long-term health when on diet or felt well when not following a diet. The present study highlights the importance of ongoing dietetic input in building knowledge and skills for dietary management. Further research is needed to understand the motivators and beliefs that influence dietary adherence."

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) can lead to severe intellectual impairment unless a phenylalanine-restricted diet starts early in life. It requires expert user knowledge about the protein content of foods. The ability of adults or caregivers of children with PKU to calculate protein exchanges from food labels on manufactured foods and any difficulties they encounter in interpreting food labels has not been studied systematically. Individuals with PKU or their caregivers residing in the UK were invited to complete a cross-sectional online survey that collected both qualitative and quantitative data about their experience when calculating protein exchanges from the food labelling on prepackaged foods. Data was available from 246 questionnaire respondents (152 caregivers of patients with PKU aged <18 years, 57 patients with PKU aged ≥18 years or their caregivers (n = 28), and 9 teenagers with PKU). Thirty-one per cent (n = 76/246) found it difficult to interpret food protein exchanges from food labels. The respondents listed that the main issues with protein labelling were the non-specification of whether the protein content was for the cooked or uncooked weight (64%, n = 158/246); labels stating foods contained 0 g protein but then included protein sources in the list of ingredients (56%, n = 137/246); the protein content being given after a product was prepared with regular milk rather than the dry weight of the product (55%, n = 135/246); and the non-clarity of whether the protein content was for the weight of prepared or unprepared food (in addition to non-specification of cooked or uncooked weights on food labelling) (54%, n = 133/246). Over 90% (n = 222/246) of respondents had experienced problems with food labelling in the previous six months. Misleading or confusing protein labelling of manufactured foods was common. The food industry and legislators have a duty to provide accurate and clear protein food labelling to protect populations requiring low protein diets."

The aim of this study was to identify the frequency of PAH gene variants in Turkish population with PKU. In 433 patients with PKU, PAH gene was examined using next generation sequencing (NGS) method. IVS10- 11G>A, p.R261Q, p.A300S, p.A403V, and p.T380 variants, which are the most common variants in this study, constituted 45,9% of the variants in our study. Nine novel variants p.A34V, K73Qfs*4, R157H, R261S, p.T266I, p.S310P, T328A, p.F351I, and K363N were identified. This study determines the most common PAH variants in Turkey and shows that PKU can be screened before marriage with the screening kits. Identification of the PAH gene variant spectrum is important for early diagnosis, understanding molecular mechanisms, clinical follow-up, treatment, and genetic counseling. And the novel variants found this study are important for further studies."

    "title": "Phenylketonuria oxidative stress and energy dysregulation: Emerging pathophysiological elements provide interventional opportunity.",
    "abstract": "Phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) deficient phenylketonuria (PKU) is rightfully considered the paradigm treatable metabolic disease. Dietary substrate restriction (i.e. phenylalanine (Phe) restriction) was applied >60 years ago and remains the primary PKU management means. The traditional model of PKU neuropathophysiology dictates blood Phe over-representation directs asymmetric blood:brain barrier amino acid transport through the LAT1 transporter with subsequent increased cerebral Phe concentration and low concentrations of tyrosine (Tyr), tryptophan (Trp), leucine (Leu), valine (Val), and isoleucine (Ile). Low Tyr and Trp concentrations generate secondary serotonergic and dopaminergic neurotransmitter paucities, widely attributed as drivers of PKU neurologic phenotypes. White matter disease, a central PKU characteristic, is ascribed to Phe-mediated tissue toxicity. Impaired cerebral protein synthesis, by reduced concentrations of non-Phe large neutral amino acids, is another cited pathological mechanism. The PKU amino acid transport model suggests Phe management should be more efficacious than is realized, as even early identified, continuously treated patients that retain therapy compliance into adulthood, demonstrate neurologic disease elements. Reduced cerebral metabolism was an early-recognized element of PKU pathology. Legacy data (late 1960's to mid-1970's) determined the Phe catabolite phenylpyruvate inhibits mitochondrial pyruvate transport. Respirometry of Pah<sup>enu2</sup> cerebral mitochondria have attenuated respiratory chain complex 1 induction in response to pyruvate substrate, indicating reduced energy metabolism. Oxidative stress is intrinsic to PKU and Pah<sup>enu2</sup> brain tissue presents increased reactive oxygen species. Phenylpyruvate inhibits glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase that generates reduced niacinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate the obligatory cofactor of glutathione reductase. Pah<sup>enu2</sup> brain tissue metabolomics identified increased oxidized glutathione and glutathione disulfide. Over-represented glutathione disulfide argues for reduced glutathione reductase activity secondary to reduced NADPH. Herein, we review evidence of energy and oxidative stress involvement in PKU pathology. Data suggests energy deficit and oxidative stress are features of PKU pathophysiology, providing intervention-amenable therapeutic targets to ameliorate disease elements refractory to standard of care."

    "abstract": "Classical phenylketonuria (PKU, OMIM 261600) owes to hepatic deficiency of phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) that enzymatically converts phenylalanine (Phe) to tyrosine (Tyr). PKU neurologic phenotypes include impaired brain development, decreased myelination, early onset mental retardation, seizures, and late-onset features (neuropsychiatric, Parkinsonism). Phe over-representation is systemic; however, tissue response to hyperphenylalaninemia is not consistent. To characterize hyperphenylalaninemia tissue response, metabolomics was applied to Pah<sup>enu2</sup> classical PKU mouse blood, liver, and brain. In blood and liver over-represented analytes were principally Phe, Phe catabolites, and Phe-related analytes (Phe-conjugates, Phe-containing dipeptides). In addition to Phe and Phe-related analytes, the metabolomic profile of Pah<sup>enu2</sup> brain tissue evidenced oxidative stress responses and energy dysregulation. Glutathione and homocarnosine anti-oxidative responses are apparent Pah<sup>enu2</sup> brain. Oxidative stress in Pah<sup>enu2</sup> brain was further evidenced by increased reactive oxygen species. Pah<sup>enu2</sup> brain presents an increased NADH/NAD ratio suggesting respiratory chain complex 1 dysfunction.

Glycolysis pathway analytes are over-represented in Pah<sup>enu2</sup> brain tissue. PKU pathologies owe to liver metabolic deficiency; yet, Pah<sup>enu2</sup> liver tissue shows neither energy disruption nor anti-oxidative response. Unique aspects of metabolomic homeostasis in PKU brain tissue along with increased reactive oxygen species and respiratory chain deficit provide insight to neurologic disease mechanisms. While some elements of assumed, long standing PKU neuropathology are enforced by metabolomic data (e.g. reduced tryptophan and serotonin representation), energy dysregulation and tissue oxidative stress expand mechanisms underlying neuropathology."

Demographic characteristics of 108 patients with hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA) and 94 patients whose diagnosis was confirmed by <i>PAH</i> gene analysis (Sanger DNA Sequence Analysis and Next-Generation Sequencing) were determined retrospectively. Blood phenylalanine levels were analyzed using the high-performance liquid chromatography method. Mild HPA-not-requiring-treatment (NT) was found in 50.9% of the patients, and a classical phenylketonuria (PKU) phenotype was found in 25.9%. Forty-seven types of variants were identified. The predominant variants were p.Ala403Val (9.9%), p.Ala300Ser (9.4%), and c.1066-11G>A (splicing) (9.4%). Missense mutations accounted for 68% of mutations and attenuated the clinical impact; splice variations were found in 14.8% of cases with severe features. The p.Thr380Met allele was specific to the mild HPA-NT group. The c.1066-11G>A (splicing) allele was associated with classical PKU, whereas the p.Arg408Trp allele was linked to severe symptoms. Three variations of unknown clinical significance were discovered: c.706+4A>T (splicing), c.843-5T>C (splicing), and p.Thr323=. Of these variants, the patient who was homozygous for the c.843-5T>C (splicing) allele related to the classical PKU phenotype. 70% of the patients who underwent tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) test were responsive. Phenotypes that responded to BH4 treatment were mostly mild phenotypes. The <i>PAH</i> genotype is the main factor that determines the phenotype of PKU. Establishing the relationship between the identified genetic mutations and phenotypic characteristics will provide very important data for each patient in terms of the specific management style."

Our eventual goal is to develop a PAL microcapsule formulation to deplete phenylalanine in the gastrointestinal tract (g.i.t). The focus of this research is pre-formulation studies with PAL. PAL exhibited undesirable time dependent decrease in activity due to TCA mediated product inhibition. Addition of bovine serum albumin (BSA) completely relieved product inhibition. Ultrafiltration experiments revealed that BSA acted by binding and sequestering TCA. PAL exhibits maximum activity at a pH of 8.5 and will need to be buffered to retain activity in the g.i.t. Buffer studies showed that a pH 8.5, 0.4 M Bicine buffer containing BSA was able to maintain maximal PAL activity against simulated gastric and intestinal fluid additions. Buffered PAL with BSA was able to rapidly and completely deplete phenylalanine in simulated mouse g.i.t conditions. A small fraction of phenylalanine in the g.i.t is present as dipeptides. Our studies established for the first time that PAL cannot metabolize phenylalanine dipeptides. Our results explain why previous trials with PAL in the management of phenylketonuria produced low efficacy. They will guide design of a PAL microcapsule formulation that maintains maximal PAL activity during its transit through the g.i.t."

Therefore, we sought to evaluate whether enzyme substitution therapy with pegvaliase initiated near birth and administered repetitively to C57Bl/6-Pah<sup>enu2/enu2</sup> mice would prevent HPA-related behavioral and cognitive deficits and form a model for early-treated PKU. The main results of three reported experiments are: 1) lifelong weekly pegvaliase treatment prevented the cognitive deficits associated with HPA in contrast to persisting deficits in mice treated with pegvaliase only as adults. 2) Cognitive deficits reappear in mice treated with weekly pegvaliase from birth but in which pegvaliase is discontinued at 3 months age. 3) Twice weekly pegvaliase injection also prevented cognitive deficits but again cognitive deficits emerged in early-treated animals following discontinuation of pegvaliase treatment during adulthood, particularly in females. In all studies, pegvaliase treatment was associated with complete correction of brain monoamine neurotransmitter content and with improved overall growth of the mice as measured by body weight. Mean total brain weight however remained low in all PAH deficient mice regardless of treatment. Application of enzyme substitution therapy with pegvaliase, initiated near birth and continued into adulthood, to PAH-deficient Pah<sup>enu2/enu2</sup> mice models contemporary early-treated human PKU. This model will be useful for exploring the differential pathophysiologic effects of HPA at different developmental stages of the murine brain."

Slovenia started the NBS program for PKU in 1979, and the fluorimetric method was implemented in 1992, with a phenylalanine (Phe) cut-off set at 120 mol/L. This value has been in use for almost thirty years and has never been revised. We aimed to analyze the DBS samples and review the data from a large nationwide cohort of newborns to optimize the cut-off values for HFA screening to minimize the number of false positives while maintaining the highest level of sensitivity by detecting all those who needed to be treated. In the first prospective part of the study, we analyzed samples of all newborns in Slovenia in 2019 and 2020, and in the second retrospective part, we reviewed data from all known patients with hyperphenylalaninemia (HFA) in Slovenia born from 2000 to 2018. We defined true screening-positive cases as those that required a low-Phe diet. The sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive values of the modeling elevation of the Phe cut-off value from 120 µmol/L to 200 µmol/L were assessed. The number of recalls at the cut-off of 120 µmol/L was 108 out of 37,784 samples at NBS (2019-2020). Six newborns were defined as true positives and 102 samples as false positives. If the cut-off value was adjusted to 160 µmol/L, only 12 samples exceeded it and all six true positive newborns would be detected. Among the 360,000 samples collected at the NBS between 2000 and 2018, 72 HFA patients in need of a low-Phe diet were found. All the diagnosed cases would have been detected if the cut-off was set to 160 µmol/L. We demonstrated in a large group of newborns (400,000 in 20 years) that using the fluorimetric approach, a cut-off value of 160 µmol/L, rather than 120 mol/L, is safe and that there were no missing true positive patients who required treatment. By increasing the cut-off, this method becomes more precise, resulting in a significantly reduced rate of false positives and thus being less burdensome on both families and the healthcare system."

If PKU is left untreated, high concentrations of phenylalanine (Phe) accumulate in the blood, leading to severe brain dysfunction, neurodevelopmental, behavioral and psychological problems. Data concerning the epidemiology of PKU in Jordan are limited. The main objectives of our study were to determine the prevalence of PKU in Jordan, analyze the PKU phenotypes, and identify major challenges in providing dietary management to PKU patients. Data were collected utilizing the medical records of PKU patients attending the PKU clinic at the Ministry of Health in Amman, Jordan, between 2008 and 2021. The total number of patients diagnosed with PKU was 294. The prevalence of PKU was estimated to be 1/5263. Most patients were Jordanians (90.8%), and 9.2% were non-Jordanians. More than half of the patients (56%) were diagnosed through the national newborn screening (NBS) program. Regarding the phenotypes of PKU, 46.6% had moderate PKU, whereas 42.9% had the classic type of PKU and only 8 (2.7%) had cofactor Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) deficiency (atypical PKU). According to the age of diagnosis, 66% of patients were diagnosed more than 30 days post-birth. Consanguinity was found in 87.4% of patients, and the majority of patients, 218 (74.2%), had first-degree consanguinity. The most common complication was mental retardation (31%). Most patients were committed to dietary management (83%) and developed fewer complications. In our study, we demonstrated the importance of the NBS program in the early identification and diagnosis of new PKU cases which allows the initiation of treatment and dietary management to prevent severe complications of PKU in Jordan."

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an autosomal recessive disease caused by variants in the gene that encodes phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH), limiting the metabolism of phenylalanine (Phe). When PAH activity is absent or hindered, Phe is not converted to tyrosine, leading to an accumulation of Phe in the blood, which can cause serious neurological complications. Once PKU is diagnosed, treatment should be started immediately, and the basis for this is dietary restriction of foods with high levels of Phe, associated with the use of protein substitutes and intake of foods with low protein content. This restriction accompanies patients throughout their lives, making their diets unpalatable and monotonous, which represents a major challenge for health professionals and patients, considering that these factors favor food transgression. In this context, the objective of this work was to carry out an integrative review based on evidence regarding the intake of fruits and vegetables, by phenylketonurics, taking into account the greater or lesser tolerance to Phe. Since, some researchers have dedicated themselves to evaluating the biochemical effect of unrestricted consumption of fruits and vegetables at PKU, unifying the information in this regard. It was observed that the intake of vegetable protein by patients with PKU has shown to be promising since the studies indicate that the intake of these proteins does not present adverse effects to the metabolic control of the Phe."

    "abstract": "To determine the carrier rate for 21 inherited metabolic diseases among a Chinese population of childbearing age. A total of 897 unrelated healthy individuals (including 143 couples) were recruited, and DNA was extracted from their peripheral blood samples. Whole exome sequencing (WES) was carried out to screen potential variants among 54 genes associated with 21 inherited metabolic diseases. Pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants and unreported loss-of-function variants were analyzed. One hundred fourty types of pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants (with an overall number of 183) and unreported loss-of-function variants were detected, which yield a frequency of 0.20 per capita. A husband and wife were both found to carry pathogenic variants of the SLC25A13 gene and have given birth to a healthy baby with the aid of preimplantation genetic diagnosis. The detected variants have involved 40 genes, with the most common ones including ATP7B, SLC25A13, PAH, CBS and MMACHC. Based on the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the incidence of the 21 inherited metabolic diseases in the population was approximately 1/1100, with the five diseases with higher incidence including citrullinemia, methylmalonic acidemia, Wilson disease, glycogen storage disease, and phenylketonuria. This study has preliminarily determined the carrier rate and incidence of 21 inherited metabolic diseases among a Chinese population of childbearing age, which has provided valuable information for the design of neonatal screening program for inherited metabolic diseases. Pre-conception carrier screening can provide an important measure for the prevention of transmission of Mendelian disorders in the population."

    "abstract": "Prime editing is a highly versatile CRISPR-based genome editing technology that works without DNA double-strand break formation. Despite rapid technological advances, in vivo application for the treatment of genetic diseases remains challenging. Here, we developed a size-reduced <i>Sp</i>Cas9 prime editor (PE) lacking the RNaseH domain (PE2<sup>Δ<i>RnH</i></sup>) and an intein-split construct (PE2 p.1153) for adeno-associated virus-mediated delivery into the liver. Editing efficiencies reached 15% at the <i>Dnmt1</i> locus and were further elevated to 58% by delivering unsplit PE2<sup>Δ<i>RnH</i></sup> via human adenoviral vector 5 (AdV). To provide proof of concept for correcting a genetic liver disease, we used the AdV approach for repairing the disease-causing <i>Pah<sup>enu2</sup></i> mutation in a mouse model of phenylketonuria (PKU) via prime editing. Average correction efficiencies of 11.1% (up to 17.4%) in neonates led to therapeutic reduction of blood phenylalanine, without inducing detectable off-target mutations or prolonged liver inflammation. Although the current in vivo prime editing approach for PKU has limitations for clinical application due to the requirement of high vector doses (7 × 10<sup>14</sup> vg/kg) and the induction of immune responses to the vector and the PE, further development of the technology may lead to curative therapies for PKU and other genetic liver diseases."

    "title": "Evaluation of the anti-osteoporotic effect of a low-phenylalanine whey protein hydrolysate in an ovariectomized mice model.",
    "abstract": "A phenylalanine (Phe)-restricted diet is indispensable to control the blood Phe for individuals with phenylketonuria (PKU), who are also confronted with progressive bone impairment. Thus, the development of a low-Phe protein substitute that could positively regulate bone metabolism is desired for their bone health. Our previous study reported the preparation of a low-Phe containing whey hydrolysate (LPH) from a selected whey protein hydrolysate (TAH). However, the effect of LPH on the bone status is unknown. In this study, we used an ovariectomized (OVX) mice model to evaluate the anti-osteoporotic potential of oral administration of whey protein concentrate (WPC, protein control), TAH, and LPH on bone physiology and bone metabolism. The results showed that after 12 weeks of treatment, the decreased bone mineral density, the deteriorated trabecular microarchitecture, and the reduced ultimate load due to ovariectomy were significantly attenuated by two whey protein hydrolysates (TAH and LPH); meanwhile, the body weight, uterine weight, bone composition, and the femoral elastic load of OVX mice had not been significantly affected by whey samples. In addition, LPH and TAH dual-regulated bone remodeling in OVX mice through triggering osteogenesis (promoted the expression of runt-related protein 2 (Runx2) and osteoformation markers) and inhibiting osteoresorption as well as inflammation. The modulated mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling and the inhibited nuclear factor κB signaling by LPH and TAH might relate to the dual-regulatory activities on bone. Overall, in the OVX mice model, LPH exerted higher osteoprotective potential than TAH of the same dose by activating the bone formation markers and inhibiting the inflammatory status. The current study demonstrated for the first time the potential use of a low-Phe whey hydrolysate, a protein substitute for PKU individuals, in the prevention of osteoporosis."

    "abstract": "The physical and functional outcomes of lifelong treatment with a phenylalanine restricted diet for the management of Phenylketonuria (PKU) remain unknown. Given that the mainstay of dietary management consists of modifying the sources of ingested protein, various aspects of body protein status could be compromised. To examine the existing evidence regarding the protein status of people with PKU and identify nutritional and lifestyle variables that influence protein status. Studies reporting anthropometric, biochemical and/or functional measurements of body protein status in people with PKU were eligible. MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), CENTRAL, Web of Science and Scopus, and conference abstracts. Seventy studies were included in the review. The majority of studies assessing protein status based on anthropometric measurements observed no differences between people with PKU and controls, although deficits in muscle mass were reported within PKU cohorts. Findings for biochemical assessment of protein status were mixed and limited studies assessed protein status using functional measures. Factors such as participant age, sex, metabolic control, protein source, type of protein substitute, and pharmacological treatments were found to modulate protein status of people with PKU. Findings were inconclusive regarding body protein status in people with PKU. The relationship between diet and protein status outcomes remains unclear and further research is warranted to determine the impact of dietary regimens on physical and functional outcomes, and to understand the best clinical assessments to reliably monitor the protein status in people with PKU."

    "abstract": "For patients with phenylketonuria (PKU), stringent dietary management is demanding and eating out may pose many challenges. Often, there is little awareness about special dietary requirements within the hospitality sector. This study’s aim was to investigate the experiences and behaviours of people with PKU and their caregivers when dining out. We also sought to identify common problems in order to improve their experiences when eating outside the home. Individuals with PKU or their caregivers residing in the UK were invited to complete a cross-sectional online survey that collected both qualitative and quantitative data about their experiences when eating out. Data were available from 254 questionnaire respondents (136 caregivers or patients with PKU < 18 years and 118 patients with PKU ≥ 18 years (n = 100) or their caregivers (n = 18)). Fifty-eight per cent dined out once per month or less (n = 147/254) and the biggest barrier to more frequent dining was ‘limited choice of suitable low-protein foods’ (90%, n = 184/204), followed by ‘no information about the protein content of foods’ (67%, n = 137/204). Sixty-nine per cent (n = 176/254) rated their dining experience as less than satisfactory. Respondents ranked restaurant employees’ knowledge of the PKU diet as very poor with an overall median rating of 1.6 (on a scale of 1 for extremely poor to 10 for extremely good). Forty-four per cent (n = 110/252) of respondents said that restaurants had refused to prepare alternative suitable foods; 44% (n = 110/252) were not allowed to eat their own prepared food in a restaurant, and 46% (n = 115/252) reported that restaurants had refused to cook special low-protein foods. Forty per cent (n = 101/254) of respondents felt anxious before entering restaurants. People with PKU commonly experienced discrimination in restaurants, with hospitality staff failing to support their dietary needs, frequently using allergy laws and concerns about cross-contamination as a reason not to provide suitable food options. It is important that restaurant staff receive training regarding low-protein diets, offer more low-protein options, provide protein analysis information on all menu items, and be more flexible in their approach to cooking low-protein foods supplied by the person with PKU. This may help people with PKU enjoy safe meals when dining out and socialising with others."

    "abstract": "There is an increasing number of adults and elderly patients with phenylketonuria (PKU) who are either early, late treated, or untreated. The principal treatment is a phenylalanine-restricted diet. There is no established UK training for dietitians who work with adults within the specialty of Inherited Metabolic Disorders (IMDs), including PKU. To address this, a group of experienced dietitians specializing in IMDs created a standard operating procedure (SOP) on the dietetic management of adults with PKU to promote equity of care in IMD dietetic services and to support service provision across the UK. The group met virtually over a period of 12 months until they reached 100% consensus on the SOP content. Areas of limited evidence included optimal blood phenylalanine reporting times to patients, protein requirements in older adults, management of weight and obesity, and management of disordered eating and eating disorders. The SOP does not include guidance on maternal PKU management. The SOP can be used as a tool for training dietitians new to the specialty and to raise the standard of education and care for patients with PKU in the UK."

The inborn error of phenylalanine metabolism was diagnosed in the neonatal period based on population new-born screening. Despite early implementation of a low-phenylalanine diet and good biochemical control, the patient developed behavioural disorders and intellectual disability. He also presented with dysmorphic features. After long and extensive attempts to establish the genetic cause of this unusual phenotype, finally, at the age of 16 the boy was diagnosed with Alazami syndrome based on whole exome sequencing. The authors discussed the problem of neuropsychological disorders in patients with phenylketonuria and described typical clinical symptoms of Alazami syndrome. It was emphasized that the presence of one monogenic disease does not exclude the coexistence of another one."

    "abstract": "A woman's nutritional status before and during pregnancy can affect the health of her progeny. Phenylketonuria (PKU), a rare disorder causing high blood and brain phenylalanine (Phe) concentrations, is associated with neurocognitive disability. Lifelong treatment is mainly dietetic with a Phe-restricted diet, supplemented with a low-Phe protein substitute. Treatment adherence commonly decreases in adolescence, with some adults ceasing dietary treatment. In maternal PKU, elevated blood Phe is harmful to the fetus so a strict Phe-restricted diet must be re-established preconception, and this is particularly difficult to achieve. A woman's reproductive years introduces an opportunity to adopt healthier behaviours to prepare for successful pregnancies and positive health outcomes for both themselves and their children. Several factors can influence the health status of women with PKU. Political, socioeconomic, and individual food and lifestyle choices affect diet quality, metabolic control, and epigenetics, which then pre-condition the overall maternal health and long-term health of the child. Here, we reflect on a comprehensive approach to treatment and introduce practical recommendations to optimize the wellbeing of women with PKU and the resultant health of their children."

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an inborn error of metabolism affecting the conversion of phenylalanine (Phe) into tyrosine. Previous research has found cognitive and functional brain alterations in individuals with PKU even if treated early. However, little is known about working memory processing and its association with task performance and metabolic parameters. The aim of the present study was to examine neural correlates of working memory and its association with metabolic parameters in early-treated adults with PKU. This cross-sectional study included 20 early-treated adults with PKU (mean age: 31.4 years ± 9.0) and 40 healthy controls with comparable age, sex, and education (mean age: 29.8 years ± 8.2). All participants underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of working memory to evaluate the fronto-parietal working memory network. Fasting blood samples were collected from the individuals with PKU to acquire a concurrent plasma amino acid profile, and retrospective Phe concentrations were obtained to estimate an index of dietary control. On a cognitive level, early-treated adults with PKU displayed significantly lower accuracy but comparable reaction time in the working memory task compared to the control group. Whole-brain analyses did not reveal differences in working memory-related neural activation between the groups. Exploratory region-of-interest (ROI) analyses indicated reduced neural activation in the left and right middle frontal gyri and the right superior frontal gyrus in the PKU group compared to the control group. However, none of the ROI analyses survived correction for multiple comparisons. Neural activation was related to concurrent Phe, tyrosine, and tryptophan concentrations but not to retrospective Phe concentrations. In early-treated adults with PKU, cognitive performance and neural activation are slightly altered, a result that is partly related to metabolic parameters. This study offers a rare insight into the complex interplay between metabolic parameters, neural activation, and cognitive performance in a sample of individuals with PKU."

Our aim was to evaluate the social restrictions and eating problems that children with PKU and their caregivers experience with dietary treatment. A web-based questionnaire, based on the Behavioral Pediatrics Feeding Assessment Scale with additional PKU-specific questions, was developed in close collaboration with and distributed by the Dutch PKU Association, which sent an e-mail to its members containing a link to the questionnaire. The questionnaire was completed by caregivers of children with PKU in the Netherlands and caregivers of age-matched children without PKU. Data were analyzed with the Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U test using SPSS. Compared with caregivers of children in the control group (ages 1-16 y; n = 50), caregivers of children with PKU (ages 1-16 y; n = 57) reported more difficulty in offering food variety, experienced more stress when eating an evening meal outside the home and during vacation, and were stricter about (accidental) spilling of food during dinner by the child (P < 0.05). They also reported to being angrier, more frustrated, and more anxious when feeding their child, and they more often felt that their child's eating pattern had a negative influence on the child's general health (P < 0.05). This pilot study provides further evidence that restriction of social activities and eating problems associated with dietary restrictions is more common in children with PKU, and warrants awareness on this topic among professionals working with these children."

    "abstract": "Increasing evidence suggests the involvement of peripheral amino acid metabolism in the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders, whereas the molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) is a cofactor for enzymes that catalyze phenylalanine metabolism, monoamine synthesis, nitric oxide production, and lipid metabolism. BH4 is synthesized from guanosine triphosphate and regenerated by quinonoid dihydropteridine reductase (QDPR), which catalyzes the reduction of quinonoid dihydrobiopterin. We analyzed Qdpr<sup>-/-</sup> mice to elucidate the physiological significance of the regeneration of BH4. We found that the Qdpr<sup>-/-</sup> mice exhibited mild hyperphenylalaninemia and monoamine deficiency in the brain, despite the presence of substantial amounts of BH4 in the liver and brain. Hyperphenylalaninemia was ameliorated by exogenously administered BH4, and dietary phenylalanine restriction was effective for restoring the decreased monoamine contents in the brain of the Qdpr<sup>-/-</sup> mice, suggesting that monoamine deficiency was caused by the secondary effect of hyperphenylalaninemia. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that QDPR was primarily distributed in oligodendrocytes but hardly detectable in monoaminergic neurons in the brain. Finally, we performed a behavioral assessment using a test battery. The Qdpr<sup>-/-</sup> mice exhibited enhanced fear responses after electrical foot shock. Taken together, our data suggest that the perturbation of BH4 metabolism should affect brain monoamine levels through alterations in peripheral amino acid metabolism, and might contribute to the development of anxiety-related psychiatric disorders.

Regarding the high prevalence of PKU in Iran, the PKU screening program was started in Iran in 2006. This study was conducted to determine the cost-effectiveness of PKU screening in Iran. An economic evaluation was performed among screened and treated individuals compared to no screening in 2013. The study population included 1356132 newborns that screened for PKU diagnosis. Lifetime costs, quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gains and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) were calculated from the perspective of government. A discount rate of 3% was considered for both QALYs and costs. A one-way sensitivity analysis was used for assessing the robustness of the results. The discounted lifetime cost of intervention and non-intervention were $59528953.8 and $85295501.6 respectively. Therefore, the total estimated cost saving was $25766547.84. PKU screening produces an ICER of $1844420 per QALY gained. Screening and early treatment for PKU is highly cost-effective. Therefore, the screening can improve quality of life of the patients and increase financial saving in health system."

Suboptimal outcomes may be related to the different absorption kinetics of free AAs, which have lower biological efficacy than natural proteins. Physiomimic Technology<sup>TM</sup> is a technology engineered to prolong AA (AA-PT) release allowing physiological absorption and masking the odor and taste of free AAs. The aim of these studies was to assess the impact of AA-PT formulation on selected functional and metabolic parameters both in acute and long-term experimental studies. Adult rats in fasting conditions were randomized in different groups and treated by oral gavage. Acute AA-PT administration resulted in significantly lower BUN at 90 min versus baseline. Both BUN and glycemia were modulated in the same direction as intact casein protein. Long-term treatment with AA-PT significantly reduces the protein expression of the muscle degradation marker Bnip3L (-46%) while significantly increasing the proliferation of market myostatin (+58%). Animals dosed for 15 days with AA-PT had significantly stronger grip strength (+30%) versus baseline. In conclusion, the results suggest that the AA-PT formulation may have beneficial effects on both AA oxidation and catabolism with a direct impact on muscle as well as on other metabolic pathways."

    "abstract": "The use of casein glycomacropeptide (CGMP) as a protein substitute in phenylketonuria (PKU) has grown in popularity. CGMP is derived from κ casein and is a sialic-rich glycophosphopeptide, formed by the action of chymosin during the production of cheese. It comprises 20-25% of total protein in whey products and has key biomodulatory properties. In PKU, the amino acid sequence of CGMP has been adapted by adding the amino acids histidine, leucine, methionine, tyrosine and tryptophan naturally low in CGMP. The use of CGMP compared to mono amino acids (L-AAs) as a protein substitute in the treatment of PKU promises several potential clinical benefits, although any advantage is supported only by evidence from non-PKU conditions or PKU animal models. This review examines if there is sufficient evidence to support the bioactive properties of CGMP leading to physiological benefits when compared to L-AAs in PKU, with a focus on blood phenylalanine control and stability, body composition, growth, bone density, breath odour and palatability."

The purpose of this study was to identify problems of patients with phenylketonuria (PKU) and their parents/caregivers during that time. We aimed to analyse potential differences in the self-reported compliance and characteristics of contacts with a doctor/dietitian before and during the pandemic lockdown and the perception of access to special food and opinions on remote contacts between a particular group of respondents. All participants (<i>n</i> = 614) were asked to complete an online questionnaire that consisted of 31 questions on pandemic-related events and circumstances which may have directly or indirectly impacted health and treatment. The people who completed the survey were divided into three groups: parents of PKU children (<i>n</i> = 403), parents of PKU adults (<i>n</i> = 58) and PKU patients older than 16 years (<i>n</i> = 153). The differences among the three analysed groups were found in the number of contacts, the way of contacting a doctor/dietitian during the pandemic and satisfaction with remote contact. Caregivers of children with PKU reported better therapy compliance, more frequent contacts with specialists and more satisfaction with remote visits than adult patients. We also observed a relationship between satisfaction from remote contact and self-reported frequency of contacts with a doctor/dietitian, as well as a relationship between satisfaction from remote contact and recommended blood Phe levels reported by both patients and caregivers. Travel time exceeding three hours from the respondents' location to their doctor was associated with higher odds of their recognition of remote contact as a method of PKU treatment only in the group of caregivers. In the caregiver groups, the reported worse access to low-Phe products during the lockdown was linked to the perceived difficulty of maintaining the diet. However, such a relationship was not found among patients. In conclusion, significant differences in the perception of the pandemic lockdown and its impact on health and treatment-related issues were found."

    "abstract": "Deep mutational scanning (DMS) has recently emerged as a powerful method to study protein sequence-function relationships but it has not been well-explored as a guide to enzyme engineering and identifying pathways by which their catalytic cycle may be improved. We report such a demonstration in this work using a Phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), which deaminates L-phenylalanine to <i>trans</i>-cinnamic acid and has widespread application in chemo-enzymatic synthesis, agriculture, and medicine. In particular, the PAL from <i>Anabaena variabilis</i> (AvPAL*) has garnered significant attention as the active ingredient in Pegvaliase<sup>®</sup>, the only FDA-approved drug treating classical Phenylketonuria (PKU). Although an extensive body of literature exists on the structure, substrate-specificity, and catalytic cycle, protein-wide sequence determinants of function remain unknown, as do intermediate reaction steps that limit turnover frequency, all of which has hindered rational engineering of these enzymes. Here, we created a detailed sequence-function landscape of AvPAL* by performing DMS and revealed 112 mutations at 79 functionally relevant sites that affect a positive change in enzyme fitness. Using fitness values and structure-function analysis, we picked a subset of positions for comprehensive single- and multi-site saturation mutagenesis and identified combinations of mutations that led to improved reaction kinetics in cell-free and cellular contexts. We then performed QM/MM and MD to understand the mechanistic role of the most beneficial mutations and observed that different mutants confer improvements via different mechanisms, including stabilizing transition and intermediate states, improving substrate diffusion into the active site, and decreasing product inhibition. This work demonstrates how DMS can be combined with computational analysis to effectively identify significant mutations that enhance enzyme activity along with the underlying mechanisms by which these mutations confer their benefit."

    "abstract": "Patients with phenylketonuria (PKU), an inborn error of phenylalanine metabolism, require consistent treatment to avoid the brain toxicity caused by hyperphenylalaninemia. The treatment consists of life-long use of a low-phenylalanine diet, which aims at decreasing hyperphenylalaninemia and maintaining blood phenylalanine concentration in a safe range. Problems with balancing diet can result in suboptimal treatment outcomes; however, recent findings suggest that genetic alteration of the transport of phenylalanine might result in an additional health burden. We assessed the effect of a common variant (rs113883650) of the LAT1(SLC7A5) gene, which encodes the main transmembrane phenylalanine transporter, on the development of overweight in 54 infants with PKU who received standard therapy and adhered well to therapeutic prescriptions, and in 55 infants with a milder disease form-the so-called mild hyperphenylalaninemia (MHP), which does not require treatment. We found that infants with PKU-carriers of the rs113883650 variant had significantly higher Body Mass Index (BMI) at 1 year compared to PKU infants without the variant (mean BMI Z-Score of +1.15 SD vs -0.15 SD, respectively; t(52) = 5.25, p = 0.00005). Conversely, no significant BMI differences were detected in the subgroups of infants with MHP (t(53) = 1.15, p = 0.25). Additionally, high BMI in infants with PKU-carriers of the rs113883650 variant positively correlated with high variability of their blood phenylalanine levels (r(52) = 0.42, p = 0.002). It should be noted that this is an observational study, which does not determine causation. Nevertheless, our findings show that the rs113883650 variant of the LAT1 gene may be a risk factor for overweight in properly treated infants with PKU. Management precautions should be taken to prevent the development of overweight and obesity."

    "abstract": "Base editing tools enabled efficient conversion of C:G or A:T base pairs to T:A or G:C, which are especially powerful for targeting monogenic lesions. However, <i>in vivo</i> correction of disease-causing mutations is still less efficient because of the large size of base editors. Here, we designed a dual adeno-associated virus (AAV) strategy for <i>in vivo</i> delivery of base editors, in which deaminases were linked to Cas9 through the interaction of GCN4 peptide and its single chain variable fragment (scFv) antibody. We found that one or two copies of GCN4 peptide were enough for the assembly of base editors and produced robust targeted editing. By optimization of single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) that target phenylketonuria (PKU) mutation, we were able to achieve up to 27.7% correction <i>in vitro</i>. <i>In vivo</i> delivery of this dual AAV base editing system resulted in efficient correction of PKU-related mutation in neonatal mice and subsequent rescue of hyperphenylalaninemia-associated syndromes. Considering the similarity between Cas9 proteins from different organisms, our delivery strategy will be compatible with other Cas9-derived base editors."

    "abstract": "Neonatal screening in Germany currently comprises 19 congenital diseases, 13 of which are metabolic diseases. Approximately one in 1300 newborns suffers from one of these target diseases. Early diagnosis and treatment enable the affected children to undergo better development and even, in many cases, to have a normal life. This review is based on pertinent publications retrieved by a selective search in the PubMed and Embase databases. Positive screening findings are confirmed in approximately one out of five newborns. The prompt evaluation of suspected diagnoses is essential, as treatment for some of these diseases must be initiated immediately after birth to prevent longterm sequelae. The most commonly identified diseases are primary hypothyroidism (1:3338), phenylketonuria/hyperphenylalaninemia (1 : 5262), cystic fibrosis (1 : 5400), and medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (1 : 10 086). Patient numbers are rising as new variants of the target diseases are being identified, and treatments must be adapted to their heterogeneous manifestations. Precise diagnosis and the planning of treatment, which is generally lifelong, are best carried out in a specialized center. Improved diagnosis and treatment now prolong the lives of many patients with congenital diseases. The provision of appropriate long-term treatment extending into adulthood will be a central structural task for screening medicine in the future."

    "abstract": "More than 1280 variants in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene are responsible for a broad spectrum of phenylketonuria (PKU) phenotypes. While the genotype-phenotype correlation is reaching 88%, for some inconsistent phenotypes with the same genotype additional factors like tetrahydrobiopterin (BH<sub>4</sub>), the PAH co-chaperone DNAJC12, phosphorylation of the PAH residues or epigenetic factors may play an important role. Very recently an additional player, the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) transcript HULC, was described to regulate PAH activity and enhance residual enzyme activity of some PAH variants (e.g., the most common p.R408W) by using HULC mimics. In this review we present an overview of the lncRNA function and in particular the interplay of the HUCL transcript with the PAH and discuss potential applications for the future treatment of some PKU patients."

The neurobiological background of these conditions has been linked to abnormalities of neurotransmitters, such as dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, and gamma-aminobutyric acid. Here, we review the psychiatric profile of all patients with BH4 defects followed in the pediatric and adult metabolic clinics at our center. Three patients with autosomal recessive (AR) guanosine triphosphate cyclohydrolase (GTPCH) deficiency and three patients with 6-pyruvoyl tetrahydropterin synthase (PTPS) deficiency were reviewed.All patients had behavioral disturbances and two had significant psychiatric comorbidities. These included attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, anxiety, depression, aggression, or oppositional defiant disorder. One patient with PTPS deficiency had a severe psychiatric presentation, requiring inpatient admission and temporary placement into foster care for intensive behavioral therapy. Another with AR GTPCH deficiency was diagnosed with aggressive behavioral dysregulation requiring intensive psychiatric treatment. Management of the psychiatric manifestations of BH4 defects can be challenging, due to lack of information and studies of interactions between psychiatric medications on the deficient neurotransmitters and their receptors in these conditions. Further studies are needed to establish safety and efficacy of these treatments."

    "abstract": "Acute intoxication-type inborn errors of metabolism (IT-IEM) such as urea cycle disorders and non-acute IT-IEM such as phenylketonuria (PKU) and their treatment have a major impact on the life of affected children and families. Yet patients' and parents' perspectives on the burdens of IT-IEM and its effects on everyday functioning and well-being have rarely been addressed. Patient- and observer-reported outcomes (PROs/ObsROs) are critically important to evaluate and target health care and treatment efficacy. Therefore, it is mandatory to define PROs/ObsROs relevant to patients with IT-IEM, their families, and health care professionals and to provide valid, standardised and reliable measuring instruments. To achieve consensus we performed a two-round, electronic-based modification of a Delphi survey including 27 parents of affected children, nine teenage patients and 35 health professionals (physicians, nutritionists, psychologists). The final set of PROs/ObsROs was discussed and defined in an online consensus meeting with a subsample of three health professionals, three parents and two patients. For this final set, appropriate measures (PROMs/ObsROMs) were assembled. Seventeen PROs/ObsROs constitute the final core set for paediatric IT-IEM. They cover social (e.g. social participation), emotional (e.g. positive affect), and disease-related aspects (e.g. attitude towards treatment) of patients' lives as well as the experience of parents (e.g. parental stress). To promote a holistic treatment approach, this consensus-driven set of relevant PROs/ObsROs should be incorporated into daily IT-IEM care and considered as the key psychological outcomes in clinical trials. We have identified existing-psychometrically and contextual-appropriate PROMs/ObsROMs with open access to facilitate this process."

In this study, patients with phenylalanine metabolism disorder who applied to Bursa Uludag University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, Pediatric Metabolism Department between 2011 and 2021 were retrospectively examined. The files of 397 patients who were followed up in our pediatric metabolism outpatient clinic and were found to have phenylalanine metabolism disorder by plasma phenylalanine level and molecular genetic analysis were evaluated. According to the highest plasma phenylalanine levels at admission, mild hyperphenylalaninemia phenotype constituted the largest group of 397 patients with 282 cases (71.1%), while the least common phenotype was malignant phenylketonuria (BH4 metabolism disorder) with four patients (1.0%). The number of patients with classical phenylketonuria was 90 (22.6%). 61 (62.8%) of 97 phenylalanine metabolism disorder cases who underwent BH4 loading test had a response. The mean phenylalanine level of the patients was 3.62 ± 1.31 mg/dL in mild hyperphenylalaninemia, 7.98 ± 3.99 mg/dL in mild phenylketonuria and 11.71 ± 4.39 mg/dL in classical phenylketonuria.

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria is a recessive genetic disorder of amino-acid metabolism, where impaired phenylalanine hydroxylase function leads to the accumulation of neurotoxic phenylalanine levels in the brain. Severe cognitive and neuronal impairment are observed in untreated/late-diagnosed patients, and even early treated ones are not safe from life-long sequelae. Despite the wealth of knowledge acquired from available disease models, the chronic effect of Phenylketonuria in the brain is still poorly understood and the consequences to the aging brain remain an open question. Thus, there is the need for better predictive models, able to recapitulate specific mechanisms of this disease. Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), with their ability to differentiate and self-organize in multiple tissues, might provide a new exciting <i>in vitro</i> platform to model specific PKU-derived neuronal impairment. In this review, we gather what is known about the impact of phenylalanine in the brain of patients and highlight where hiPSC-derived organoids could contribute to the understanding of this disease."

    "abstract": "In the category of rare inherited genetic disorders, phenylketonuria is a prominent example. Here, the defective phenylalanine hydroxylase enzyme fails to catalyze conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine. This leads to not only excess deposition of phenylalanine leading to phenylalanine toxicity but also precludes the production of important glutamatergic and cholinergic neurotransmitters, leading to epileptic disorders, microcephaly, low intelligence quotient etc. For long, specialized food products are considered as preferred solution to prevent disease outcome. Different medical diets are developed for managing phenylketonuria includes amino acid mixtures, protein hydrolysates, cofactor-based therapy, large neutral amino acids and glycomacropeptides. However, despite the advent of alternate forms of diet products, the central form of treatment has still been free amino acid mixture. The formulated diet is by and large expensive and in-depth evaluation of several factors which contribute to the expense of medicated diet is requisite to create effective yet affordable avenues for management of disease. For this, we have discussed the role of various factors involved in increasing price of medicated diet and presented possible solutions to it. We have also extensively reviewed prevalence of disease, commercial diet for PKU patients, and their associated limitations. Overall, this is the first attempt to present a holistic view of balance between the overall impact of diet associated therapy and weighing it against the associated finances incurred."

    "title": "A culture model for the assessment of phenylalanine neurotoxicity in phenylketonuria.",
    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is caused by a specific mutation of the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene. The deficiency of PAH results in high phenylalanine levels (Phe), low tyrosine levels (Tyr), and reduced catecholamine neurotransmitters. The majority of PKU patients, if untreated, develop severe mental retardation. The specific contribution of high Phe and low Tyr levels in mental retardation is largely unknown. In this study, we used organic hippocampal slice cultures in an optimized medium as an adequate culture model to decipher the precise role of high Phe and low Tyr levels on synaptic and glial integrity in PKU. The hippocampus is closely related to learning and memory and reduced catecholamine neurotransmitter levels can be neglected since these neurotransmitters do not derive from the hippocampus. Cultures exposed to physiological concentrations of Phe were compared with cultures exposed to doses of Phe/Tyr, as in the cerebral fluid of PKU patients. Using capillary western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry, followed by quantitative image analysis, we tested the expression of various pre- and postsynaptic proteins (PSD95, synaptopodin, SNAP25, synaptophysin), glial cell markers (GFAP, Iba1, P2Y12, CD68, C3b), and the morphology of glial cells. We found a downregulation of the postsynaptic protein PSD95 and the presynaptic protein SNAP25 in the presence of high/low Phe/Tyr levels after 3 weeks, which, then however, recovered after 6 weeks in culture. Furthermore, no change in the expression pattern of glial proteins was observed. Our results show that high Phe levels/low Tyr levels alone are unlikely to substantially contribute to mental retardation in PKU. The direct neurotoxic potency of high Phe/low Tyr concentrations is almost negligible since the effects are transient. The transient character in the presence of unchanged levels of high Phe/low Tyr points to a role of reduced catecholamine derivate neurotransmitters, rather than of high Phe/low Tyr levels in PKU."

The phenylalanine levels in clinical serum determined by this fluorescence assay are consistent with those from HPLC.

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a metabolic disorder caused by a hepatic enzyme deficiency causing high blood and brain levels of the amino acid Phenylalanine (Phe), leading to severe cognitive and psychological deficits that can be prevented, but not completely, by dietary treatment. The behavioral outcome of PKU could be affected by the gut-microbiome-brain axis, as diet is one of the major drivers of the gut microbiome composition. Gut-microbiome alterations have been reported in treated patients with PKU, although the question remains whether this is due to PKU, the dietary treatment, or their interaction. We, therefore, examined the effects of dietary Phe restriction on gut-microbiome composition and relationships with behavioral outcome in mice. Male and female BTBR Pah<sup>enu2</sup> mice received either a control diet (normal protein, \"high\" Phe), liberalized Phe-restricted (33% natural protein restriction), or severe Phe-restricted (75% natural protein restriction) diet with protein substitutes for 10 weeks (<i>n</i> = 14 per group). Their behavioral performance was examined in an open field test, novel and spatial object location tests, and a balance beam. Fecal samples were collected and sequenced for the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) region. Results indicated that PKU on a high Phe diet reduced Shannon diversity significantly and altered the microbiome composition compared with wild-type animals. Phe-restriction prevented this loss in Shannon diversity but changed community composition even more than the high-Phe diet, depending on the severity of the restriction. Moreover, on a taxonomic level, we observed the highest number of differentially abundant genera in animals that received 75% Phe-restriction. Based on correlation analyses with differentially abundant taxa, the families <i>Entereococacceae, Erysipelotrichaceae, Porphyromonadaceae</i>, and the genus <i>Alloprevotella</i> showed interesting relationships with either plasma Phe levels and/or object memory. According to our results, these bacterial taxa could be good candidates to start examining the microbial metabolic potential and probiotic properties in the context of PKU. We conclude that PKU leads to an altered gut microbiome composition in mice, which is least severe on a liberalized Phe-restricted diet. This may suggest that the current Phe-restricted diet for PKU patients could be optimized by taking dietary effects on the microbiome into account."

It is mainly caused by a deficiency in phenylalanine hydroxylase (<i>PAH</i>) and frequently diagnosed with Sanger sequencing. To some extent, allelic dropout can explain the inconsistency in genotype and phenotype. Three families were evaluated through DNA sequence analysis, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) and prenatal diagnosis technologies. The possibility of inconsistency in phenotype and genotype with c.331C>T variant was analysed. Through pedigree analysis, three mothers carried a homozygous c.331C>T variant, which was a false-positive result. New primers were used, and this error was caused by allelic dropout. In this case, c.158G>A was likely a benign variant. Sequence variants in primer-binding regions could cause allelic dropout, creating unpredictable errors in genotyping. Our results emphasised the need for careful measures to treat genotype-phenotype inconsistencies."

In Iran, the prevalence of PKU is estimated at about 1 in 4,698, and it shows an increasing trend from north (0.0015%) to south (0.02%) of the country. Untreated PKU causes mental retardation, microcephaly, and seizure. PAH gene mutations located at chromosome 12q23 are responsible for the classical type of this disease. The spectrum of PAH mutations is varied in different ethnicities and different parts of the world. The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency of PAH mutation in the Mazandaran province, which could be useful for genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis. A total of 66 individuals from 33 families from two provinces (9 families from Golestan and 24 families from Mazandaran) from north of Iran participated in this study. After genomic DNA extraction, PAH gene analysis was carried out using DNA sequencing of both coding and non-coding regions by ABI 3130XL genetic analyzer. Twenty-six different mutations were identified in the PAH gene in this study. Four mutations including IVS10-11 (c.1066-11G>A), c.727C>T (p.Arg243X), c.898G>T (p.Ala300Ser), and c.601C>T (p.His201Tyr) were the most common mutations with 37.48% frequency in Mazandaran province.

    "abstract": "Management of phenylketonuria (PKU) is mainly achieved through dietary control with limited intake of phenylalanine (Phe) from food, supplemented with low protein (LP) food and a mixture of free synthetic (FS) amino acids (AA) (FSAA). Casein glycomacropeptide (CGMP) is a natural peptide released in whey during cheese making by the action of the enzyme chymosin. Because CGMP in its pure form does not contain Phe, it is nutritionally suitable as a supplement in the diet for PKU when enriched with specific AAs. Lacprodan® CGMP-20 (= CGMP) used in this study contained only trace amounts of Phe due to minor presence of other proteins/peptides. The aims were to address the following questions in a classical PKU mouse model: Study 1, off diet: Can pure CGMP or CGMP supplemented with Large Neutral Amino Acids (LNAA) as a supplement to normal diet significantly lower the content of Phe in the brain compared to a control group on normal diet, and does supplementation of selected LNAA results in significant lower brain Phe level?. Study 2, on diet: Does a combination of CGMP, essential (non-Phe) EAAs and LP diet, provide similar plasma and brain Phe levels, growth and behavioral skills as a formula which alone consist of FSAA, with a similar composition?. 45 female mice homozygous for the Pahenu2 mutation were treated for 12 weeks in five different groups; G1(N-CGMP), fed on Normal (N) casein diet (75%) in combination with CGMP (25%); G2 (N-CGMP-LNAA), fed on Normal (N) casein diet (75%) in combination with CGMP (19,7%) and selected LNAA (5,3% Leu, Tyr and Trp); G3 (N), fed on normal casein diet (100%); G4 (CGMP-EAA-LP), fed on CGMP (70,4%) in combination with essential AA (19,6%) and LP diet; G5 (FSAA-LP), fed on FSAA (100%) and LP diet. The following parameters were measured during the treatment period: Plasma AA profiles including Phe and Tyr, growth, food and water intake and number of teeth cut. At the end of the treatment period, a body scan (fat and lean body mass) and a behavioral test (Barnes Maze) were performed. Finally, the brains were examined for content of Phe, Tyr, Trp, dopamine (DA), 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), serotonin (5-HT) and 5-hydroxyindole-acetic acid (5-HIAA), and the bone density and bone mineral content were determined by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Study 1: Mice off diet supplemented with CGMP (G1 (N-CGMP)) or supplemented with CGMP in combination with LNAA (G2 (N-CGMP-LNAA)) had significantly lower Phe in plasma and in the brain compared to mice fed only casein (G3 (N)). Extra LNAA (Tyr, Trp and Leu) to CGMP did not have any significant impact on Phe levels in the plasma and brain, but an increase in serotonin was measured in the brain of G2 mice compared to G1. Study 2: PKU mice fed with mixture of CGMP and EAA as supplement to LP diet (G4 (CGMP-EAA-LP)) demonstrated lower plasma-Phe levels but similar brain- Phe levels and growth as mice fed on an almost identical combination of FSAA (G5 (FSAA-LP)). CGMP can be a relevant supplement for the treatment of PKU."

A retrospective review of genetically confirmed cases of disorders of tetrahydrobiopterin metabolism over a period of three years (Jan 2018 to Jan 2021) was performed across two paediatric neurology centres from South India. A total of nine patients(M:F=4:5) fulfilled the eligibility criteria. The genetic variants detected include homozygous mutations in the QDPR(n=6), GCH1(n=2), and PTS(n=1) genes. The median age at onset of symptoms was 6-months(range 3-78 months), while that at diagnosis was 15-months (8-120 months), resulting in a median delay in diagnosis of 9-months. The main clinical manifestations included neuroregression (89%), developmental delay(78%), dystonia(78%) and seizures(55%). Management strategies included a phenylalanine restricted diet, levodopa/carbidopa, 5-Hydroxytryphtophan, and folinic acid. Only, Patient-2 afforded and received BH4 supplementation at a sub-optimal dose later in the disease course. We had a median duration of follow up of 15 months (range 2-48 months). Though the biochemical response has been marked; except for patients with GTPCH deficiency, only mild clinical improvement was noted with regards to developmental milestones, seizures, or dystonia in others. Tetrahydrobiopterin deficiencies represent a rare yet potentially treatable cause for non-phenylketonuria hyperphenylalaninemia with better outcomes when treated early in life. Screening for disorders of biopterin metabolism in patients with hyperphenylalaninemia prevents delayed diagnosis. This study expands the genotype-phenotype spectrum of patients with disorders of tetrahydrobiopterin metabolism from South India."

    "abstract": "Cells have evolved sophisticated molecular control systems to maximize the efficiency of the folding process. However, any subtle alteration of the environment or the protein can lead to misfolding or affect the conformational plasticity of the native states. It has been widely demonstrated that misfolding and/or conformational instability are the underlying mechanisms of several rare disorders caused by enzymatic deficits. In fact, disease-causing mutations often lead to the substitution of amino acids that are crucial for the achievement of a folded conformation, or play a role on the equilibrium between native-state conformers. One of the promising approaches to treat conformational disorders is the use of pharmacological chaperones (PCs), small molecules that specifically bind a target protein and stabilize a functional fold, thus increasing the amount of functionally active enzyme. Molecules acting as PCs are usually coenzymes, substrate analogues behaving as competitive inhibitors, or allosteric modulators. In this review, the general features of PCs are described, along with three examples of diseases (Gaucher disease, Phenylketonuria, and Primary Hyperoxaluria) in which this approach is currently under study at preclinical and/or clinical level."

There are few patients and published studies about inborn errors of metabolism. The main objective of this study was to describe the effectiveness of orphan drugs in inborn errors of metabolism in paediatric patients. Retrospective descriptive study of 24 months on patients diagnosed with inborn errors of metabolism during childhood and who attended the pharmacy clinic or Day-Care Unit of a 630-bed general hospital. The study included 15 patients with a median age of 17.8 years and were treated with nine different drugs: sapropterin, sodium phenylbutyrate, miglustat, velaglucerase, sebelipase, idursulfase, 5-hydroxytryptophan, succinate, and riboflavin. Seven different inborn errors of metabolism were observed: phenylketonuria, defects of the urea cycle, Gaucher, Nieman-Pick, Hunter's disease, along with acid lipase deficiency, and mitochondrial diseases. Orphan drugs used for the treatment of inborn errors of metabolism accounted for 1.3% of hospital drug costs. Some orphan drugs achieved asymptomatic patients, but others just produced a modest symptomatic improvement. Most patients showed good tolerance to the treatment. Orphan drugs used in inborn errors of metabolism had an easy to manage toxicity profile, with many disparities in effectiveness. These drugs have a high economic impact. The cost-effectiveness ratio for orphan drugs is a controversial issue due to their high cost and the inconclusive clinical evidence."

While its working mechanisms and optimal composition have recently been further elucidated, the question whether LNAA treatment requires the natural protein-restricted diet, has still remained. Firstly, to determine whether an additional liberalized natural protein-restricted diet could further improve brain amino acid and monoamine concentrations in phenylketonuria mice on LNAA treatment. Secondly, to compare the effect between LNAA treatment (without natural protein) restriction and different levels of a phenylalanine-restricted diet (without LNAA treatment) on brain amino acid and monoamine concentrations in phenylketonuria mice. BTBR Pah-enu2 mice were divided into two experimental groups that received LNAA treatment with either an unrestricted or semi phenylalanine-restricted diet. Control groups included Pah-enu2 mice on the AIN-93 M diet, a severe or semi phenylalanine-restricted diet without LNAA treatment, and wild-type mice receiving the AIN-93 M diet. After ten weeks, brain and plasma samples were collected to measure amino acid profiles and brain monoaminergic neurotransmitter concentrations. Adding a semi phenylalanine-restricted diet to LNAA treatment resulted in lower plasma phenylalanine but comparable brain amino acid and monoamine concentrations as compared to LNAA treatment (without phenylalanine restriction). LNAA treatment (without phenylalanine restriction) resulted in comparable brain monoamine but higher brain phenylalanine concentrations compared to the severe phenylalanine-restricted diet, and significantly higher brain monoamine but comparable phenylalanine concentrations as compared to the semi phenylalanine-restricted diet. Present results in PKU mice suggest that LNAA treatment in PKU patients does not need the phenylalanine-restricted diet. In PKU mice, LNAA treatment (without phenylalanine restriction) was comparable to a severe phenylalanine-restricted diet with respect to brain monoamine concentrations, notwithstanding the higher plasma and brain phenylalanine concentrations, and resulted in comparable brain phenylalanine concentrations as on a semi phenylalanine-restricted diet."

    "abstract": "PTC923 (formerly CNSA-001), an oral formulation of sepiapterin, a natural precursor of intracellular tetrahydrobiopterin (BH<sub>4</sub>), has been shown in humans to induce larger increases in circulating BH<sub>4</sub> vs. sapropterin dihydrochloride. Sapropterin reduces blood phenylalanine (Phe) by ≥20-30% in a minority of subjects with PKU. This was a Phase 2 randomized, multicenter, three-period crossover, open-label, active controlled, all-comers [regardless of phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) variants] comparison of PTC923 60 mg/kg, PTC923 20 mg/kg and sapropterin 20 mg/kg in 24 adults with phenylketonuria (PKU) and hyperphenylalaninemia. Eligible subjects were adult men or women (18-60 y) with PKU. Subjects enrolled received 7 days of once-daily oral treatment with PTC923 20 mg/kg/day, PTC923 60 mg/kg/day and sapropterin dihydrochloride 20 mg/kg/day each in a random order. Treatments were separated by a 7-day washout. Subjects maintained their usual pre-study diet, including consumption of amino acid mixtures. Blood Phe was measured on Day 1 (predose baseline), Day 3, Day 5, and Day 7 of each treatment period. Least squares mean changes (SE) from baseline in blood Phe were: -206.4 (41.8) μmol/L for PTC923 60 mg/kg (p < 0.0001); -146.9 (41.8) μmol/L for PTC923 20 mg/kg (p = 0.0010); and - 91.5 (41.7) μmol/L for sapropterin (p = 0.0339). Effects of PTC923 60 mg/kg on blood Phe vs. sapropterin were significantly larger (p = 0.0098) and faster in onset with a significantly larger mean reduction in blood Phe at day 3 of treatment, p = 0.0135 (20 mg/kg) and p = 0.0007 (60 mg/kg). Only PTC923 60 mg/kg reduced blood Phe in classical PKU subjects (n = 11, p = 0.0287). The mean blood Phe reduction (PTC923 60 mg/kg) in a cofactor responder analysis (n = 8; baseline Phe ≥300 μmol/L and blood Phe reduction ≥30%) was -463.3 μmol/L (SE 51.5) from baseline. Adverse events were mostly mild to moderate, transient, and similar across treatment groups with no serious adverse events or discontinuations. The substantially significantly better effect of PTC923 60 mg/kg on blood Phe reduction vs. sapropterin supports further clinical development of PTC923 for PKU; ANZCTR number, ACTRN12618001031257."

    "title": "Preliminary Investigation of Microbiome and Dietary Differences in Patients with Phenylketonuria on Enzyme Substitution Therapy Compared to Traditional Therapies.",
    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an inborn error of metabolism that impairs the function of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. Historical treatment includes limiting dietary phenylalanine (Phe) consumption while supplementing with medical food; however, this treatment has been associated with complications, such as nutritional deficiencies and disruptions in the gut microbiota. The study aim was to compare dietary and gut microbiome differences between adult patients on a traditional PKU diet with those receiving the enzyme substitution therapy Palynziq on a liberalized diet while controlling blood Phe levels to <600 μmol/L (to convert to mg/dL divide by 60.5). A cross-sectional study was conducted comparing patients on a traditional Phe-restricted diet with patients receiving Palynziq eating a liberalized diet. Six patients eating a traditional Phe-restricted diet with medical food and 6 patients on Palynziq eating a liberalized diet without medical food intake for more than 3 years were selected from the University of Kentucky Metabolic Clinic from August to December 2019. Nutrient intake from 3-day diet records and fecal microbiome taxonomic abundances were analyzed. Mann-Whitney U tests were used for dietary data analysis. Differential abundance analysis for microbiome taxa and pathway data was done using DESeq2 analysis. Dietary data showed patients receiving Palynziq consumed a lower percent of kilocalories from total protein and lower amounts of most micronutrients, but consumed greater amounts of intact protein and cholesterol (P < .05). Microbiome data revealed a greater abundance of the phylum Verrucomicrobia and genus Lachnobacterium in the Traditional group and a greater abundance of the genus Prevotella in the Palynziq group (P < .05). Pathway analysis depicted greater enrichment in carotenoid and amino acid metabolism pathways in the Traditional group (P < .05). Protein (% kcal), dietary fiber (g), fat (% kcal), linolenic acid (% Dietary Reference Intakes), and age were correlated with the underlying microbial community structure for both groups combined. Patients with PKU treated with Palynziq on a liberalized diet manifest significant differences in diet composition compared with those treated with traditional Phe-restricted diets. Several of these dietary differences may affect the microbiome architecture."

    "abstract": "In phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) deficiency, an easily feasible method to access the progression of neurodegeneration is warranted to contribute to current discussions on treatment indications and targets. The objective of the present study was to investigate whether optical coherence tomography (OCT) measures as markers of neurodegeneration differ between patients with PAH deficiency and healthy controls (HCs) according to phenotype and metabolic control. In this single-center cross-sectional study, 92 patients with different phenotypes of PAH deficiency [PAH deficiency not requiring treatment, early treated phenylketonuria (ETPKU), and late-diagnosed phenylketonuria (PKU)] compared with 76 HCs were examined using spectral-domain OCT. Indices of phenylalanine elevation and variability were correlated with OCT parameters. Late-diagnosed PKU patients showed reduced peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL) thickness and combined ganglion cell and inner plexiform layer (GCIPL) volume. Adult ETPKU patients were found to have lower GCIPL volume (<i>p</i> = 0.016), which correlated with the indices of phenylalanine control. In pediatric ETPKU patients with poor metabolic control, pRNFL was significantly reduced (<i>p</i> = 0.004). Patients with PAH deficiency not requiring treatment did not exhibit retinal degeneration. Inner nuclear layer (INL) was significantly increased in the pediatric ETPKU patients, driven by those with current poor metabolic control (<i>p</i> = 0.006). Our data provide evidence of retinal neuroaxonal degeneration and INL swelling, depending on the phenotype, current age, and metabolic control. These findings suggest that OCT is suitable to investigate neurodegeneration in PKU and we propose OCT as a sensitive, reliable, safe, low-burden, and low-cost examination for future multicenter studies."

We systematically reviewed the available literature related to the Health Related Quality Of Life (HRQOL) of caregivers of children with Phenylketonuria (PKU). <i>Methods.</i> We comprehensively searched in electronic databases including Scopus, Science Direct, CINAHL, Medline, PubMed, Google scholar, and ProQuest. The search criteria included studies with samples more than one, children suffering from PKU, exploring parents or primary caregiver's HRQOL, published from 2010 to 2020, full article available for download and published in English. Eight studies including 5 cross sectional studies, 1 open label trial, and 2 surveys were systematically reviewed. <i>Results.</i> Seven out of 8 studies have established a negative correlation between PKU and parent's HRQOL in at least 1 of the domains. In one study, the HRQOL of parents is higher than their population norms. <i>Conclusion.</i> Most of the caregivers had poor to moderate HRQOL. More studies are required to explore HRQOL of caregivers of children with PKU using similar tools and outcome measures addressing all the domains of HRQOL in order to have more clarity on the impact of PKU on caregiver's HRQOL. Interventional studies might help in improving the HRQOL of caregivers."

    "abstract": "Although T cells play important roles in various immune reactions, there are only a few reports on delivery systems into T cells. Our previous study showed that carboxy-terminal phenylalanine (Phe)-modified polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimers have both temperature- and pH-sensitive properties, which are affected by the chemical structure. The self-assembled structures of Phe, observed in phenylketonuria, enhance the protein aggregation, the association with the cell membrane and the membrane permeability. In this study, we applied the Phe-modified dendrimers to a pH-sensitive drug delivery system into T cells. Dendrimers with different amino acids and acid anhydrides were synthesized, and their pH-responsive association with T cells and their subsets was investigated. The dendrimers modified with Phe and cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid (CHex) showed higher uptake into various cells, including Jurkat cells, CD3+ T cells, CD3 + CD4+ helper T cells and CD3 + CD8+ killer T cells. These dendrimers were internalized into T cells <i>via</i> endocytosis, and their cellular uptake was enhanced under weak acidic conditions (pH 6.5). Our results showed that Phe- and CHex-modified dendrimers have a delivery potential to T cells and their subsets, which may be useful for cancer immunotherapy."

    "abstract": "Recently published European Society for Phenylketonuria (ESPKU) guidelines have recommended a lifelong diet with phenylalanine (Phe) control ≤ 600 μmol/L for phenylketonuria (PKU) patients. This study aimed to identify whether PKU adult patients are at a higher risk of mental health diagnoses if their 2-year average Phe level is higher than the ESPKU European guidelines. Published studies identified by a literature review showed that related studies have been published in American and European PKU study populations but not in the United Kingdom (UK) study populations. Previous studies also involved a smaller number of participants due to this being a rare disease. We undertook a retrospective audit at a single large PKU centre in the UK. 244 adult PKU patients at the centre were included, 220 of which had a recorded Phe level. Approximately 75% of the patients in this study did not meet the ESPKU European guidelines for Phe control. A systematic search of the electronic patient record was undertaken looking for mental health diagnoses. Compared to two-year average Phe levels ≤ 600 μmol/L, PKU adult patients with two-year average Phe levels > 600 μmol/L were more likely to have diagnoses of low mood, depression, anxiety, or mood swings, but only low mood reached statistical significance (p < 0.05). PKU patients with two-year average Phenylalanine levels greater than ESPKU guidelines may be at greater risk of mental health diagnoses and symptoms. Many of these adult PKU patients will be lost to follow-up, and therefore may be receiving treatment for mental health conditions in the community. Multicentre UK studies and international collaborations are required to overcome low participant numbers in the study of this rare disease."

    "title": "Measuring Burden of Illness in Phenylketonuria (PKU): Development of the PKU Symptom Severity and Impacts Scale as a Robust Patient-Reported Outcome.",
    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a rare, metabolic genetic disorder that can cause various neuropsychological symptoms that often affect patients' health-related quality of life, even for patients with good metabolic control. To date, no patient-reported outcomes (PRO) instrument combines the measurement of neuropsychological and dietary concepts to capture the broad impact of PKU on quality of life. This article presents the development of the PKU Symptom Severity and Impacts Scale (PKU-SSIS), a PRO instrument that is designed to evaluate neuropsychological symptoms and impacts in early-treated patients with PKU. A draft instrument was developed based on a targeted literature review, PKU expert physician interviews, and an advisory board consisting of patients with PKU. Qualitative interviews combining concept elicitation/cognitive interviews were conducted with patients with classic PKU aged at least 15 years old. A separate sample of 20 patients with PKU completed the draft PKU-SSIS in a paper survey format, to enable preliminary assessment of any floor and ceiling effects. Patient interviews elicited four key symptom themes: neurocognitive function, emotional and behavioral, physical functioning, and physical health. Four impact themes were also identified: social function, physical health, emotions, and level of independence. No floor or ceiling effects were identified. The final instrument included 22 items, covering three symptom domains (1. emotional, mood, and psychological; 2. (neuro)cognitive, executive, and intellectual function; and 3. physical health), and four impact domains (1. social relations, 2. level of independence, 3. general well-being, and 4. self-care). The PKU-SSIS will help to address an important gap in the evaluation of existing and future treatments for PKU."

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a metabolic disease that can cause severe and irreversible brain damage without treatment. Here we developed a non-invasive prenatal diagnosis (NIPD) technique based on haplotypes via paired-end molecular tags and weighting algorithm and applied it to the NIPD of PKU to evaluate its accuracy and feasibility in the early pregnancy. A custom-designed hybridization probes containing regions in phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene and its 1 Mb flanking region were used for target sequencing on genomic and maternal plasma DNA (7-13 weeks of gestation) to construct the parental haplotypes and the proband's haplotype. Fetal haplotype was then inferred combined with the parental haplotypes and the proband's haplotype. The presence of haplotypes linked to both the maternal and paternal mutant alleles indicated affected fetuses. The fetal genotypes were further validated by invasive prenatal diagnosis in a blinded fashion. This technique has been successfully applied in twenty-one cases. Six fetuses were diagnosed as patients carrying both of the mutated haplotypes inherited from their parents. Eleven fetuses were carriers of one heterozygous PAH variants, six of which were paternal and five of which were maternal. Four fetuses were absence of pathogenic alleles. All results were consistent with the prenatal diagnosis through amniotic fluid. The results showed that our new technique applied to the genotyping of fetuses with high risk for PKU achieves an accurate detection at an early stage of pregnancy with low fetal fraction in cell free DNA."

    "title": "Cheating the Cheater: Suppressing False-Positive Enrichment during Biosensor-Guided Biocatalyst Engineering.",
    "abstract": "Transcription factor (TF)-based biosensors are very desirable reagents for high-throughput enzyme and strain engineering campaigns. Despite their potential, they are often difficult to deploy effectively as the small molecules being detected can leak out of high-producer cells, into low-producer cells, and activate the biosensor therein. This crosstalk leads to the overrepresentation of false-positive/cheater cells in the enriched population. While the host cell can be engineered to minimize crosstalk (e.g., by deleting responsible transporters), this is not easily applicable to all molecules of interest, particularly those that can diffuse passively. One such biosensor recently reported for <i>trans</i>-cinnamic acid (tCA) suffers from crosstalk when used for phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) enzyme engineering by directed evolution. We report that desensitizing the biosensor (i.e., <i>increasing</i> the limit of detection) suppresses cheater population enrichment. Furthermore, we show that, if we couple the biosensor-based screen with an orthogonal prescreen that eliminates a large fraction of true negatives, we can successfully reduce the cheater population during the fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Using the approach developed here, we were successfully able to isolate PAL variants with ∼70% higher <i>k</i><sub>cat</sub> after a single sort. These mutants have tremendous potential in phenylketonuria (PKU) treatment and flavonoid production."

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an inherited error of metabolism, screened at 48-72 h of life since 1975 in Hungary. The patients have to keep a strict lifelong protein-restricted diet, resulting in PKU and its treatment can lead to social and financial burdens. The current study aimed to evaluate the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of children living with PKU. A single-centre, cross-sectional, observational study was conducted at the Center of Newborn Screening and Inherited Metabolic Disorders of Budapest, Hungary, using the PKU-quality of life (PKU-QoL) questionnaire. Responses of 59 parents and 11 teenagers were collected. Numerous aspects regarding HRQoL were analysed according to clinical compliance and severity. The patients were classified into groups with good or suboptimal adherence based on regular phenylalanine (Phe) values. The online officially translated versions of the adolescent or parental PKU-QoL questionnaire were used and analysed anonymously. Differences in HRQoL were compared - PKU vs. Hyperphenylalaninaemia (HPA) and good vs. suboptimal adherence. Twenty-five of 32 examined parameters had no or little impact on HRQoL. The most frequently reported symptom was irritability. Food enjoyment was the most impacted domain, with a major severity score in the adolescent group (median 62,5, IQR: 25-75). The emotional impact was scored at moderate severity by both the adolescents and parents. Classical PKU patients with good metabolic control were more frequently tired than HPA patients (0,0027). The group with poor metabolic adherence showed more frequent tiredness (<i>p</i> = 0,03), slow thinking (p = 0,018) and anxiety (p = 0,015). Overall, our patients showed an excellent HRQoL; most domains (29/36) were reported as little/no impacted. Worse QoL was found in patients with suboptimal metabolic control. Particular attention should be paid to the emotional health of PKU patients."

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an inborn error of metabolism caused by variants in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (<i>PAH</i>) gene and it is characterized by excessively high levels of phenylalanine in body fluids. PKU is a paradigm for a genetic disease that can be treated and majority of developed countries have a population-based newborn screening. Thus, the combination of early diagnosis and immediate initiation of treatment has resulted in normal intelligence for treated PKU patients. Although PKU is a monogenic disease, decades of research and clinical practice have shown that the correlation between the genotype and corresponding phenotype is not simple at all. Attempts have been made to discover modifier genes for PKU cognitive phenotype but without any success so far. We conducted whole genome sequencing of 4 subjects from unrelated non-consanguineous families who presented with pathogenic mutations in the <i>PAH</i> gene, high blood phenylalanine concentrations and near-normal cognitive development despite no treatment. We used cross sample analysis to select genes common for more than one patient. Thus, the <i>SHANK</i> gene family emerged as the only relevant gene family with variants detected in 3 of 4 analyzed patients. We detected two novel variants, p.Pro1591Ala in <i>SHANK1</i> and p.Asp18Asn in <i>SHANK2</i>, as well as <i>SHANK2</i>:p.Gly46Ser, <i>SHANK2</i>:p.Pro1388_Phe1389insLeuPro and <i>SHANK3</i>:p.Pro1716Thr variants that were previously described. Computational analysis indicated that the identified variants do not abolish the function of SHANK proteins. However, changes in posttranslational modifications of SHANK proteins could influence functioning of the glutamatergic synapses, cytoskeleton regulation and contribute to maintaining optimal synaptic density and number of dendritic spines. Our findings are linking <i>SHANK</i> gene family and brain plasticity in PKU for the first time. We hypothesize that variant SHANK proteins maintain optimal synaptic density and number of dendritic spines under high concentrations of phenylalanine and could have protective modifying effect on cognitive development of PKU patients."

    "abstract": "Measurement of quantitative levels of phenylalanine and tyrosine in blood is an essential test for the diagnosis of and monitoring genetic disorders associated with phenylalanine metabolism, such as phenylketonuria (PKU), tyrosinemia, and defects of tetrahydrobiopterin synthesis and recycling. We developed a highly accurate and fast liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for the quantification of phenylalanine and tyrosine on dried blood spot (DBS). We also designed a performance score system to evaluate various calibration methods in matrix matched material. Phenylalanine/tyrosine-free whole blood was used to make accurate and stable DBS calibrators. Six calibrators cover the range of 0-1000 µmol/L. Underivatized phenylalanine and tyrosine were extracted and measured by LC-MS/MS. Precision, accuracy, limit of quantification, recovery and carryover were validated. External quality assurance materials were also used to evaluate performance of multi-point calibrations and single-point calibrations. The run time was 4.5-minute. Accuracy analysis showed good agreement with reference materials. Precision, recovery, and the lower and upper limit of quantification met the criteria. When phenylalanine and tyrosine concentrations were less than 150 µmol/L, the 5-point calibration without the calibrator of 1000 µmol/L had the best performance. When the concentrations were > 250 µmol/L, the single-point calibration of 500 µmol/L had the best performance. We developed a simple, fast and highly accurate method for the detection of phenylalanine and tyrosine on DBS, with chromatographic separation and underivatized analysis. Based on the calibration performance, a 6-point calibration method is satisfying for this test. An optional dynamic calibration method, which includes 6-point calibration, 5-point calibration and single-point calibration, can further increase test reliability."

    "abstract": "Patients with phenylketonuria (PKU) must follow a lifelong phenylalanine (Phe)-restricted diet with additional amino acid supplementations, and this may put them at risk for nutritional disturbances. However, the body composition and nutritional status of adult patients with PKU has only been partially explored. The current study aims to assess the body composition of adult patients with PKU using multifrequency bioimpedance analysis (MF-BIA) and to reveal potential correlations between therapy adherence and body composition. Additionally, we compared body composition of patients with healthy controls. Fifty adult patients with early-treated PKU (27 female and 23 male) and 40 healthy, age- and gender-matched controls were included in this single-center, cross-sectional study. MF-BIA was performed on all subjects. Additionally, we determined serum nutritional markers for all patients. In the PKU patient group, correlation analyses were performed between body composition parameters and therapy adherence. We compared body composition of patients with PKU and controls using BIA. The proportion of overweight was 56% among all patients with PKU. Female patients with PKU had significantly higher body fat percentage compared with controls. In parallel with higher fat content, we observed lower muscle mass, protein, and mineral content among female patients with PKU compared to controls. Such findings were not observed in male patients. Female patients with PKU had decreased therapy adherence and had significantly lower prealbumin levels compared with males. There was no significant correlation observed between body composition parameters and therapy adherence over the last 10 years in the PKU patient group. Although female patients had less optimal therapy adherence over the last 10 years compared with male patients, our results suggest that this does not influence body composition fundamentally. Our results suggest that obesity is an important comorbidity in young adult patients with PKU, especially in females. We advocate that nutritional assessments and weight management should be additional objectives of PKU management to provide optimal care."

    "abstract": "There remains a limited understanding of the metabolic perturbations, beyond phenylalanine (Phe) metabolism, that contribute to phenotypic variability in phenylketonuria (PKU). This study aimed to characterize changes in the PKU plasma metabolome following a 5-d metabolic camp intervention and to compare PKU profiles with those of matched healthy controls. In 28 females (aged 12-57 y), fasting plasma samples were collected on the first (day 1) and final (day 5) days of camp to measure metabolic control and to complete untargeted metabolomic profiling. Three-day dietary records were collected to assess changes in dietary adherence and composition. Univariate (Wilcoxon signed-rank and Mann-Whitney U test) and multivariate (random forest, hierarchical clustering) analyses were performed to identify clinical and metabolic features that were associated with the intervention and disease state. Relative to healthy controls, Phe catabolites, ketones, and carnitine- and glycine-conjugated fatty acids were elevated in females with PKU at baseline, whereas fatty acylcholine metabolites were substantially lower. After the camp intervention, plasma Phe concentrations decreased [median change: -173 µmol/L (IQR: -325, -28 µmol/L)] and 70% of PKU participants demonstrated improved dietary adherence by decreasing Phe intake and/or increasing medical food consumption. This was accompanied by a shift in abundance for 223 metabolites (q < 0.05). Compounds associated with the metabolism of Phe, fatty acids, and choline contributed most to profile differences between camp days 1 and 5. In females with PKU, untargeted metabolomics identified prominent perturbations in amino acid and lipid metabolites associated with bioenergetic impairment and oxidative stress. Choline-conjugated lipids could have fundamental roles in these pathways and they have not been previously evaluated in PKU. A short-term camp intervention was effective for improving or fully normalizing the abundance of the identified discriminatory metabolites."

Body composition, DIT, FOx, CHOOx and RMR did not differ between the PKU and the Control groups. MPAD (PKU, 73 ± 26 min/week; Control, 152 ± 43 min/week) and MPAEE (PKU, 404 ± 127 kcal/week; Control, 741 ± 153 kcal/week) were lower (P < 0.05) in the PKU than the Control group. Raised phenylalanine levels were inversely related with MPAD and MPAEE. Energy intake and energy provided by protein did not differ between the groups, while energy proportion obtained from carbohydrate was higher (PKU, 60 ± 2%; Control, 51 ± 2%; P < 0.05) and from fat lower (PKU, 24 ± 2%; Control, 35 ± 3%; P < 0.05) in the PKU than in the Control group.

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an autosomal recessive error of phenylalanine (Phe) metabolism, where untreated Phe becomes cytotoxic. Previous experiments found that excess Phe decreases the packing density and increases the fluidity and permeability of a lipid membrane. It was proposed that Phe forms cytotoxic nanoscopic amyloid-like fibrils. In another study, the Phe fibrils were not visible near the lipid membrane. So, what leads to the deleterious effect of Phe on the lipid membrane? We put forward a molecular mechanism for the observed effect of excess Phe on the lipid membrane using all-atom molecular dynamics simulation. This study suggests that Phe monomers spontaneously intercalate into the membrane and form small hydrogen-bonded clusters, some of which locally perturb the membrane. These local effects result in an overall reduction in the membrane packing density, enhancement of membrane fluidity, and an increase of water permeability, observed in experiments. The present study does not observe any effect of the nanoscopic fibrillar structure of Phe on the membrane. This study, therefore, provides alternative insights into the excess Phe cytotoxicity in PKU disease."

Newborn screening helps in the presymptomatic diagnosis of many medical disorders including IEMs. Early diagnosis and management of IEMs helps reduce morbidity and mortality. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of IEMs among at-risk children and contribute toward early diagnosis and management in order to minimize morbidity and mortality. This prospective study was conducted at the Pediatrics and Neonatology Department, Sohag University Hospital, Egypt. The study enrolled 308 participants suspected of having IEMs. Cases were included based on the presence of any of the following: unexplained convulsions, persistent metabolic acidosis, persistent hypoglycemia, disturbed consciousness, delayed milestones, or family history of previous sibling death with IEMs or sibling death with a history suggestive of IEMs. All participants in the study were subjected to metabolic screening by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). Out of 308 neonates, 93 (30.2%) were diagnosed with IEMs. The most common diagnosis was phenylketonuria, followed by glutaric aciduria type 1 and maple syrup urine disease (43%, 19.4%, and 14%, respectively). Five patients had Canavan disease, four had medium-chain acyl CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, three had congenital lactic acidosis, two had methylmalonic acidemia, and two had primary carnitine deficiency. Propionic acidemia, isovaleric acidemia, homocystinuria, short-chain acyl CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, B-ketothiolase deficiency, and ketone body utilization defect were diagnosed in one patient each. Most patients improved (73.1%) following proper specific management. We recommend newborn screening for IEMs using MS/MS, which may help with the early diagnosis and management of this group of disorders."

    "title": "The impact on quality of life of diet restrictions and disease symptoms associated with phenylketonuria: a time trade-off and discrete choice experiment study.",
    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a metabolic disorder leading to a deficiency in the metabolism of phenylalanine (Phe). Elevated Phe levels in the blood, tissue and brain may lead to emotional, cognitive, and physical symptoms in adults. To control blood Phe levels, most individuals with PKU need to follow a strict, life-long Phe-restricted diet. The main objective of this study was to estimate the impact of PKU-related disease symptoms and dietary restrictions on health-related quality of life (HRQoL). This study was designed as a web-based survey using the methods of Time Trade-Off (TTO) and Discrete Choice Experiment with duration (DCE<sub>TTO</sub>) in a survey of the Swedish general population and population with PKU. Data were collected using questionnaires for TTO diet (n = 509), TTO symptoms (n = 507), and DCE<sub>TTO</sub> (n = 1117). The disutility of diet restrictions ranged from 0.050 for a partially restricted diet without medical food to 0.193 for a fully restricted diet with medical food in the TTO (DCE: 0.043-0.108). The disutility of experiencing symptoms (emotional, cognitive and physical) ranged from 0.148 for mild symptoms to 0.593 for severe symptoms in the TTO (DCE: 0.122-1.522). The study shows that both diet and symptoms have a significant negative impact on HRQoL in PKU and that utility estimates are largely consistent across methods and samples."

    "title": "Beneficial Effects of Slow-Release Large Neutral Amino Acids after a Phenylalanine Oral Load in Patients with Phenylketonuria.",
    "abstract": "The mainstay of phenylketonuria treatment is a low protein diet, supplemented with phenylalanine (Phe)-free protein substitutes and micronutrients. Adhering to this diet is challenging, and even patients with good metabolic control who follow the dietary prescriptions in everyday life ignore the recommendations occasionally. The present study explores the ability of slow-release large neutral amino acids (srLNAAs) to prevent Phe increase following a Phe dietary load. Fourteen phenylketonuric patients aged ≥13 years were enrolled in a 6-week protocol. Oral acute Phe loads of 250 and 500 mg were added to the evening meal together with srLNAAs (0.5 gr/kg). Phe and tyrosine were dosed before dinner, 2h-after dinner, and after the overnight fast. After oral Phe loads, mean plasma Phe remained stable and below 600 µmol/L. No Phe peaks were registered. Tyrosine levels significantly increased, and Phe/Tyrosine ratio decreased. No adverse events were registered. In conclusion, a single oral administration of srLNAAs at the dose of 0.5 gr/kg is effective in maintaining stable plasma Phe during acute oral loads with Phe-containing food and may be added to the dietetic scheme in situations in which patients with generally good adherence to diet foresee a higher than prescribed Phe intake due to their commitments."

    "title": "Special Low Protein Foods Prescribed in England for PKU Patients: An Analysis of Prescribing Patterns and Cost.",
    "abstract": "Patients with phenylketonuria (PKU) are reliant on special low protein foods (SLPFs) as part of their dietary treatment. In England, several issues regarding the accessibility of SLPFs through the national prescribing system have been highlighted. Therefore, prescribing patterns and expenditure on all SLPFs available on prescription in England (<i>n</i> = 142) were examined. Their costs in comparison to regular protein-containing (<i>n</i> = 182) and <i>'free-from'</i> products (<i>n</i> = 135) were also analysed. Similar foods were grouped into subgroups (<i>n</i> = 40). The number of units and costs of SLPFs prescribed in total and per subgroup from January to December 2020 were calculated using National Health Service (NHS) Business Service Authority (NHSBSA) ePACT2 (electronic Prescribing Analysis and Cost Tool) for England. Monthly patient SLPF units prescribed were calculated using patient numbers with PKU and non-PKU inherited metabolic disorders (IMD) consuming SLPFs. This was compared to the National Society for PKU (NSPKU) prescribing guidance. Ninety-eight percent of SLPF subgroups (<i>n =</i> 39/40) were more expensive than regular and <i>'free-from'</i> food subgroups. However, costs to prescribe SLPFs are significantly less than theoretical calculations. From January to December 2020, 208,932 units of SLPFs were prescribed (excluding milk replacers), costing the NHS £2,151,973 (including milk replacers). This equates to £962 per patient annually, and prescribed amounts are well below the upper limits suggested by the NSPKU, indicating under prescribing of SLPFs. It is recommended that a simpler and improved system should be implemented. Ideally, specialist metabolic dietitians should have responsibility for prescribing SLPFs. This would ensure that patients with PKU have the necessary access to their essential dietary treatment, which, in turn, should help promote dietary adherence and improve metabolic control."

There are no reports describing the dietary support children with PKU receive whilst at school. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to explore the experiences of the dietary management of children with PKU in schools across the UK. Data was collected using an online survey completed by parents/caregivers of children with PKU. Of 159 questionnaire responses, 92% (<i>n</i> = 146) of children attended state school, 6% (<i>n</i> = 10) private school and 2% (<i>n</i> = 3) other. Fourteen per cent (<i>n</i> = 21/154) were at nursery/preschool, 51% (<i>n</i> = 79/154) primary and 35% (<i>n</i> = 54/154) secondary school. Sixty-one per cent (<i>n</i> = 97/159) said their child did not have school meals, with some catering services refusing to provide suitable food and some parents distrusting the school meals service. Sixty-one per cent of children had an individual health care plan (IHCP) (<i>n</i> = 95/155). Children were commonly unsupervised at lunchtime (40%, <i>n</i> = 63/159), with snacks (46%, <i>n</i> = 71/155) and protein substitute (30%, <i>n</i> = 47/157), with significantly less supervision in secondary than primary school (<i>p</i> < 0.001). An IHCP was significantly associated with improved supervision of food and protein substitute administration (<i>p</i> < 0.01), and better communication between parents/caregivers and the school team (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Children commonly accessed non-permitted foods in school. Therefore, parents/caregivers described important issues concerning the school provision of low phenylalanine food and protein substitute. Every child should have an IHCP which details their dietary needs and how these will be met safely and discreetly. It is imperative that children with PKU are supported in school."

Depending on the Phe levels, a lifelong dietary intervention may be needed. During the COVID-19 pandemic, finding new strategies to ensure follow-up and metabolic control for such patients became mandatory and telehealth was identified as the most eligible tool to provide care and assistance beyond barriers. The aim of this study was to evaluate how telehealth use may have impacted disease follow-ups. Seven hundred and fifty-five patients affected by PKU/HPA in follow-ups at the Clinical Department of Pediatrics (San Paolo Hospital, ASST Santi Paolo e Carlo, University of Milan, Italy) were included in this study. The data regarding the used telehealth model, type of performed consultations and patients' perspectives were retrospectively collected and analyzed after a one-year experience of implemented follow-ups. The results demonstrated that telehealth seemed to be a useful tool to improve the adherence to treatment and that it could guarantee continuous assistance and care beyond the surrounding epidemiological status. Patients expressed great satisfaction with the offered services and requested that they were implemented in standards of care on a long-term basis. Our results suggested the implementation of telehealth in the management guidelines for PKU/HPA patients."

    "abstract": "Establishing the genotypes of patients with hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA)/phenylketonuria (PKU, MIM#261600) has been considered a cornerstone for rational medical management. However, knowledge of the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene (<i>PAH)</i> mutational spectrum in Latin American populations is still limited. Herein, we aim to update the mutational <i>PAH</i> spectrum in the largest cohort of HPA/PKU Mexican patients (<i>N</i> = 124) reported to date. The biallelic <i>PAH</i> genotype was investigated by Sanger automated sequencing, and genotypes were correlated with documented biochemical phenotypes and theoretical tetrahydrobiopterin (BH<sub>4</sub>) responsiveness. Patients were biochemically classified as having classic PKU (50%, 62/124), mild PKU (20.2%, 25/124) and mild HPA (29.8%, 37/124). Furthermore, 78.2% of the included patients (97/124) were identified by newborn screening. A total of 60 different pathogenic variants were identified, including three novel ones (c. 23del, c. 625_626insC and c. 1315 + 5_1315 + 6insGTGTAACAG), the main categories being missense changes (58%, 35/60) and those affecting the catalytic domain (56.6%, 34/60), and c. 60 + 5G > T was the most frequent variant (14.5%, 36/248) mainly restricted (69.2%) to patients from the central and western parts of Mexico. These 60 types of variants constituted 100 different biallelic PAH genotypes, with the predominance of compound-heterozygous ones (96/124, 77%). The expected BH<sub>4</sub> responsiveness based on the <i>PAH</i> genotype was estimated in 52% of patients (65/124), mainly due to the p. (Val388Met) (rs62516101) allele. Instead, our study identified 27 null variants with an allelic phenotype value of zero, with a predominance of c. 60 + 5G > T, which predicts the absence of BH<sub>4</sub> responsiveness. An identical genotype reported in BIOPKUdb was found in 92/124 (74%) of our patients, leading to a genotype-phenotype concordance in 80/92 (86.9%) of them. The high number of variants found confirms the heterogeneous and complex mutational landscape of HPA/PKU in Mexico."

PRISM-1 (NCT01819727) and PRISM-2 (NCT01889862) data were analyzed to evaluate the relationship between Phe and inattention in adult participants with PKU. In the modified-intent-to-treat population (N = 156), baseline mean (SE) plasma Phe was 1263 (29) μmol/L and the Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale-IV Inattentive (IA) symptoms score was 9.8 (0.5). Mean (SE) IA scores fell 9.0 (1.1) in Quartile 1 (Phe reduction between 1166 and 2229 μmol/L) versus 4.3 (0.7) in Quartile 4 (Phe reduction of 139 μmol/L to increase of 934 μmol/L), p = 0.004. Least squares mean (SE) change from baseline IA score was -7.9 (0.7) for participants with final Phe ≤ 360 μmol/L and -4.5 (0.7) for final Phe > 360 μmol/L, p < 0.001. In the inattention subgroup, IA scores fell 13.3 (1.5) in Quartile 1 (Phe reduction between 1288 and 2229 μmol/L) versus 6.2 (1.3) in Quartile 4 (Phe reduction of 247 to increase of 934 μmol/L), p = 0.009. Inattention symptoms improved among those whose Phe levels decreased, particularly those with high baseline IA scores. IA improvements were larger among participants with the greatest plasma Phe reductions, supporting this value as a therapeutic goal."

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a genetic deficiency of phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) in liver resulting in blood phenylalanine (Phe) elevation and neurotoxicity. A pegylated phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PEG-PAL) metabolizing Phe into cinnamic acid was recently approved as treatment for PKU patients. A potentially one-time rAAV-based delivery of PAH gene into liver to convert Phe into tyrosine (Tyr), a normal way of Phe metabolism, has now also entered the clinic. To understand differences between these two Phe lowering strategies, we evaluated PAH and PAL expression in livers of PAH<sup>enu2</sup> mice on brain and liver functions. Both lowered brain Phe and increased neurotransmitter levels and corrected animal behavior. However, PAL delivery required dose optimization, did not elevate brain Tyr levels and resulted in an immune response. The effect of hyperphenylalanemia on liver functions in PKU mice was assessed by transcriptome and proteomic analyses. We observed an elevation in Cyp4a10/14 proteins involved in lipid metabolism and upregulation of genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis. Majority of the gene expression changes were corrected by PAH and PAL delivery though the role of these changes in PKU pathology is currently unclear. Taken together, here we show that blood Phe lowering strategy using PAH or PAL corrects both brain pathology as well as previously unknown lipid metabolism associated pathway changes in liver."

    "abstract": "Current clinical outcome assessments (COAs) are not effectively capturing the complex array of symptoms of adults with phenylketonuria (PKU). This study aimed to identify concepts of interest relevant to adults with PKU. Based on these concepts, COAs for patient-reported outcomes (PROs), observer-reported outcomes (ObsROs), and clinician-reported outcomes (ClinROs) were selected or developed and content validity was assessed. Concept-elicitation interviews were conducted with an international cohort of adults with PKU (<i>n</i> = 30), family member observers (<i>n</i> = 14), and clinical experts (<i>n</i> = 8). Observers and clinical experts were included to overcome the risk of lack of self-awareness among adults with PKU. The concepts of interests endorsed by ≥30% of patients, observers, and/or clinical experts were selected, mapped to items in existing COAs, and used to develop global impression items for patients, observers, and clinicians. Next, the content validity of the COAs and global impression items was evaluated by cognitive interviews with patients (<i>n</i> = 22), observers (<i>n</i> = 11), and clinical experts (<i>n</i> = 8). All patients were categorized according to blood phenylalanine (Phe) levels (i.e., <600 μmol/L, 600-1200 μmol/L, and >1200 μmol/L). Concepts of interests were identified across four domains: emotional, cognitive, physical, and behavioral. After mapping, eight existing COAs were selected based on the concept coverage (six PROs, one ObsRO, and one ClinRO). The six PRO measures were considered as potentially fit-for-purpose. The ObsRO measure was not deemed relevant for use in observers of adults with PKU and only a subscale of the ClinRO measure was considered valid for assessing adults with PKU by clinicians. Due to the lack of existing COAs covering all concepts of interests, global impression items for symptom severity and change in symptoms were developed, which were limited to one question covering in total 14 concepts. Upon validation, some of the patient and observer global impression items were excluded as they were subject to lack of insight or could not be reported by observers. Due to the limited interaction time between clinician and patient, use of the clinician global impression items was not supported. Existing COAs relevant to adults with PKU were selected and PKU-specific global impression items were developed by mapping the most frequently identified concepts of interests from internationally-conducted in-depth interviews. Future studies should address the appropriateness of the selected COAs and global impression items to assess if these can be used as efficacy endpoints in PKU clinical trials."

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an inborn error disease in phenylalanine metabolism resulting from defects in the stages of converting phenylalanine to tyrosine. Although the pathophysiology of PKU is not elucidated yet, the toxic effect of phenylalanine on the brain causes severe mental retardation. In relation to learning and memory, the hippocampal PKA / CREB / BDNF pathway may play a role in learning deficits in PKU patients. This study aimed to investigate PKA/CREB/BDNF pathway in hippocampus of chemically induced PKU rats with regard to gender. Sprague-Dawley rat pups were randomized into two groups of both genders. To chemically induce PKU, animals received subcutaneous administration of phenylalanine (5.2 mmol / g) plus p-chlorophenylalanine, phenylalanine hydroxylase inhibitor (0.9 mmol / g); control animals received 0.9% NaCl. Injections started on the 6th day and continued until the 21st day after which locomotor activity, learning and memory were tested. In male PKU rats, locomotor activity was reduced. There were no differences in learning and memory performances of male and female PKU rats. In PKU rats, pCREB / CREB levels in males was unchanged while it decreased in females. Elevated PKA activity, BDNF levels and decreased pCREB/CREB ratio found in female PKU rats were not replicated in PKU males in which BDNF is decreased. Our results display that in this disease model a gender specific differential activation of cAMP/PKA-CREB-BDNF signaling pathway in hippocampus occurs investigation of which can help us to a better understanding of disease pathophysiology."

    "abstract": "Insufficient metabolic control during pregnancy of mothers with phenylketonuria (PKU) leads to maternal PKU syndrome, a severe embryo-/fetopathy. Since maintaining or reintroducing the strict phenylalanine (Phe) limited diet in adults with PKU is challenging, we evaluated the most important dietary and psychosocial factors to gain and sustain good metabolic control in phenylketonuric women throughout pregnancy by a questionnaire survey with 38 questions concerning therapy feasibility. Among them, the key questions covered 5 essential items of PKU care as follows: General information about maternal PKU, PKU training, diet implementation, individual metabolic care, personal support. In addition, all participating PKU mothers were asked to estimate the quality of their personal metabolic control of the concluded pregnancies. 54 PKU mothers with 81 pregnancies were approached at 12 metabolic centers in Germany and Austria were included. According to metabolic control, pregnancies of PKU women were divided in two groups: group \"ideal\" (not more than 5% of all blood Phe concentrations during pregnancy > 360 µmol/l; n = 23) and group \"suboptimal\" (all others; n = 51). The demand for support was equally distributed among groups, concerning both amount and content. Personal support by the direct social environment (partner, family and friends) (\"suboptimal\" 71% vs \"ideal\" 78%) as well as individual metabolic care by the specialized metabolic center (both groups around 60%) were rated as most important factors. The groups differed significantly with respect to the estimation of the quality of their metabolic situation (p < 0.001). Group \"ideal\" presented a 100% realistic self-assessment. In contrast, group \"suboptimal\" overestimated their metabolic control in 53% of the pregnancies. Offspring of group \"suboptimal\" showed clinical signs of maternal PKU-syndrome in 27%. The development of training programs by specialized metabolic centers for females with PKU in child bearing age is crucial, especially since those mothers at risk of giving birth to a child with maternal PKU syndrome are not aware of their suboptimal metabolic control. Such programs should provide specific awareness training for the own metabolic situation and should include partners and families."

In this multicenter cross-sectional study, data from children aged 8-17 years with IEMRDs (except phenylketonuria) and their parents were collected from January 2015 to December 2017. Measurements included a child's self-reported QoL, self-rated behavioral problems and anxiety, and parental anxiety. Based on hypotheses from a literature-built theoretical model linking demographic, clinical, family environment, and psychosocial characteristics to QoL either directly or indirectly, associations of these factors with a child's self-rated QoL were examined using a structural equation modeling approach. A total of 312 children (mean [SD] age, 12.2 [2.6] years; 51% boys [n = 160]) were included. Higher levels of trait anxiety and behavioral problems in children were the most important factors associated with poorer QoL (standardized path coefficients, -0.71 and -0.23, respectively). In addition, higher parent trait anxiety, younger age at diagnosis, and a disease requiring an emergency diet were associated with poorer QoL in these children. The final model fit the data closely according to conventional goodness-of-fit statistics and explained 86% of the QoL variance. Psychosocial factors appear to be major determinants of QoL impairment in children with IEMRDs. These factors should be addressed in clinical practice as part of the global treatment plan for a child with IEMRD. Future studies based on a longitudinal design should consider coping strategies when exploring potential predictive factors of QoL."

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a rare inherited metabolic disorder caused by defects in the phenylalanine-hydroxylase gene (PAH), the enzyme catalyzing the conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine. PAH impairment causes phenylalanine accumulation in the blood and brain, with a broad spectrum of pathophysiological and neurological consequences for patients. Prevalence of disease varies, with peaks in some regions and countries, including Italy. A recent expert survey described the real-life of clinical practice for PKU in Italy, revealing inhomogeneities in disease management, particularly concerning approach to pharmacotherapy with sapropterin hydrochloride, analogous of the natural PAH co-factor, allowing disease control in a subset of patients. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to continue the work initiated with the expert survey paper, to provide national guidances aiming to harmonize and optimize patient care at a national level. The Consensus Group, convened by 10 Steering Committee members, consisted of a multidisciplinary crowd of 46 experts in the management of PKU in Italy. The Steering Committee met in a series of virtual meeting in order to discuss on clinical focuses to be developed and analyzed in guidance statements, on the basis of expert practice based evidence, large systematic literature review previously performed in the expert survey paper, and evidence based consensus published. Statements were re-discussed and refined during consensus conferences in the widest audience of experts, and finally submitted to the whole consensus group for a modified-Delphi voting. Seventy three statements, divided in two main clinical areas, PKU management and Pharmacotherapy, achieved large consensus in a multidisciplinary group of expert in different aspects of disease. Importantly, these statements involve guidances for the use of sapropterin dihydrochloride, still not sufficiently implemented in Italy, and a set of good practice to approach the use of novel enzyme replacement treatment pegvaliase. This evidence-based consensus provides a minimum set of guidances for disease management to be implemented in all PKU centers. Moreover, these guidances represent the first statement for sapropterin dihydrochloride use, implementation and standardization in Italy, and a guide for approaching pegvaliase treatment at a national level on a consistent basis."

Although the individual disorders are rare, NMDs are collectively relatively common and often lead to lifelong difficulties and high societal costs. Neuropsychiatric manifestations, including ADHD symptoms, are prominent in many NMDs, also when the primary biochemical defect originates in cells and tissues outside the nervous system. ADHD symptoms have been described in phenylketonuria, tyrosinemias, alkaptonuria, succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency, X-linked ichthyosis, maple syrup urine disease, and several mitochondrial disorders, but are probably present in many other NMDs and may pose diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Here we review current literature linking NMDs with ADHD symptoms. We cite emerging evidence that many NMDs converge on common neurochemical mechanisms that interfere with monoamine neurotransmitter synthesis, transport, metabolism, or receptor functions, mechanisms that are also considered central in ADHD pathophysiology and treatment. Finally, we discuss the therapeutic implications of these findings and propose a path forward to increase our understanding of these relationships."

The aim of this study was to compare and assess the effects of two interventions on and levels of phenylalanine and micronutrients in children with PKU. Forty-six children with PKU (ages 1-12 years) and their caregivers were randomly assigned to one of two 10-week interventions: a caregiver educational intervention based on the Integrative Model of Behvioral Prediction (IMBP) and supplementary low-protein-modified foods. Outcomes consisted of Children's plasma phenylalanine and micronutrients (i.e., vitamin B12, vitamin D3, and zinc) and hemoglobin levels. To assess the sustainability of outcomes, we also compared the children's phenylalanine level at five-time points including baseline and 10-week, 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months follow-ups. In addition, caregivers of both groups were asked to complete a questionnaire to assess how well the interventions were implemented as well as satisfaction with interventions. While a large percentage of children had phenylalanine levels out of range indicating non-adherence (69.6% and 81% in the educational and food items group, respectively), micronutrient deficiencies were not prevalent in the patient cohort. The levels of phenylalanine in both groups decreased significantly over time. However, conducting a repeated-measures ANOVA to evaluating the change in groups across five-time points, revealed a significant difference between groups (F = 4.68, p = 0.03). That is, the educational intervention was more effective in lowering the children's phenylalanine level. At 24-month follow-up, the percentage of children with a normal range of phenylalanine level in the educational and food items groups increased to 73.9 and 57.1 percent, respectively, from 26 and 38 percent at baseline. There were no significant changes in children's micronutrients level following the interventions, except in the hemoglobin. In this way, at 10-week follow-up, the mean hemoglobin of children in the educational group reduced significantly (P = 0.041). However, there was no significant difference between the two groups. In general, all caregivers completed the process evaluation checklist, the feedback was largely positive. The results of this study demonstrated that both educational and providing food item interventions resulted in a significant reduction in phenylalanine levels. Empowering caregivers of patients, creating and fortifying social networks, providing favorable social supports, and providing access to special food items may be effective in controlling PKU.

We assessed clinical phenotypes and gut microbiota by 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequencing, and performed a correlation analysis between phenotype and gut microbiota in a PKU group (n=11) and a healthy group (n=11). The PKU group had significantly lower microbiota diversity than the healthy group (P<sub>shannon</sub>=0.014). Phylum-level composition differed significantly between the PKU and healthy groups (<i>Firmicutes</i>: 44.3% <i>vs.</i> 43.1%; <i>Actinobacteria</i>: 25.9% <i>vs.</i> 3.3%; <i>Bacteroidetes</i>: 16.6% <i>vs.</i> 53.2%; and <i>Proteobacteria</i>: 10.9% <i>vs.</i> 0.12%, respectively). Further, a significantly decreased level of genus Bacteroidetes (P<0.0001) in the PKU group was negatively correlated with blood Phe level (P=0.014). The microbial function prediction of the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways exhibited a decreased ability of glycan degradation and glutamate metabolism in the PKU group. Our findings revealed that genus <i>Bacteroide</i> was not only in extremely low abundance in the PKU group, but was also negatively correlated with blood Phe level. The remarkable capability of genus <i>Bacteroides</i> to use complex recalcitrant glycans may be the main reason for the decreased ability of glycan degradation in the PKU group."

    "title": "Wearable wristband-based electrochemical sensor for the detection of phenylalanine in biofluids.",
    "abstract": "Wearable electrochemical sensors are driven by the user-friendly capability of on-site detection of key biomarkers for health management. Despite the advances in biomolecule monitoring such as glucose, still, several unmet clinical challenges need to be addressed. For example, patients suffering from phenylketonuria (PKU) should be able to monitor their phenylalanine (PHE) level in a rapid, decentralized, and affordable manner to avoid high levels of PHE in the body which can lead to a profound and irreversible mental disability. Herein, we report a wearable wristband electrochemical sensor for the monitoring of PHE tackling the necessity of controlling PHE levels in PHE hydroxylase deficiency patients. The proposed electrochemical sensor is based on a screen-printed electrode (SPE) modified with a membrane consisting of Nafion, to avoid interferences in biofluids. The membrane also consists of sodium 1,2-naphthoquinone-4-sulphonate for the in situ derivatization of PHE into an electroactive product, allowing its electrochemical oxidation at the surface of the SPE in alkaline conditions. Importantly, the electrochemical sensor is integrated into a wristband configuration to enhance user interaction and engage the patient with PHE self-monitoring. Besides, a paper-based sampling strategy is designed to alkalinize the real sample without the need for sample pretreatment, and thus simplify the analytical process. Finally, the wearable device is tested for the determination of PHE in saliva and blood serum. The proposed wristband-based sensor is expected to impact the PKU self-monitoring, facilitating the daily lives of PKU patients toward optimal therapy and disease management."

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is caused by phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene variants. Previously, 94.21% of variants were identified using Sanger sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. To investigate the remaining variants, we performed whole-genome sequencing for four patients with PKU and unknown genotypes to identify deep intronic or structural variants. We identified three novel heterozygous variants (c.706+368T>C, c.1065+241C>A, and c.1199+502A>T) in a deep PAH gene intron. We detected a c.1199+502A>T variant in 60% (6/10) of PKU patients with genetically undetermined PKU. In silico predictions indicated that the three deep variants may impact splice site selection and result in the inclusion of a pseudo-exon. A c.1199+502A>T PAH minigene and reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) on blood RNA from a PKU patient with biallelic variants c.1199+502A>T and c.1199G>A confirmed that the c.1199+502A>T variant may strengthen the predicted branch point and leads to the inclusion of a 25-nt pseudo-exon in the PAH mRNA. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on the minigene revealed that c.706+368T>C may create an SRSF2 (SC35) binding site via a 313-nt pseudo-exon, whereas c.1065+241C>A may produce an 81-nt pseudo-exon that strengthens the predicted SRSF1 (SF2/ASF) binding site. These results augment current knowledge of PAH genotypes and show that deep intronic analysis of PAH can genetically diagnose PKU."

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an inherited disorder of amino acid metabolism, the treatment of which often requires a special diet to prevent adverse neuropsychiatric outcomes. In the COVID-19 pandemic, which has had a substantial effect on the whole world since the beginning of 2020, PKU patients represent a vulnerable population because they may be dependent on special nutritional products, have limited access to routine care and display increased levels of anxiety. For this reason, an online questionnaire assessing the anxiety levels and various personal opinions and practices regarding the pandemic was sent to the PKU patients managed at our clinic, who were 12 years of age or older. Ninety-eight patients responded to the questionnaire. Median age of the participants was 19 years. Most patients were compliant with the hygiene and social distancing recommendations regarding the spread of COVID-19. Of the patients, 61.2% felt more anxious since the pandemic. The most common concern was the possibility of not being able to obtain special nutritional products (58.2%). Anxiety level was significantly higher in females. These data suggest that food security is an important issue of concern in PKU patients. In line with the changing world after the pandemic, different strategies should be considered in the management of patients with inborn errors of metabolism, including PKU."

We aimed firstly to report twenty-two patients with a dual diagnosis of IMD and ASD who are still being followed up in the child metabolism outpatient clinic; secondly to evaluate the time of both IMD and ASD diagnosis and the clinical progress of their metabolic disorders to underline treatable conditions. Among the patients admitted to the Pediatric Metabolism outpatient clinic because of IMD, twentytwo of them who had a diagnosis of ASD were included in the study. Data of the patients were collected from their medical records. The most recent progress of the patients concerning their metabolic disorder was obtained from the patients` files. Six cases with Phenylketonuria, 2 cases with partial Biotinidase Deficiency, 3 cases with Cerebral Creatine Deficiency Syndrome (CCDS), 5 cases with Mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) Type-3b, 2 cases with MPS Type-3a, 1 case with MPS Type 4, 2 cases with Hypervalinemia and 1 case with Maple Syrup Urine Disease were all diagnosed as also having ASD. The diagnoses of CCDS and MPS Type 3 were after the diagnosis of ASD. Phenylketonuria and Mucopolysaccharidosis were the most common diagnoses in our study. In addition, rare entities such as MPS Type 3b and Type 4 and Hypervalinemia were also reported to co-occur with autism. Considering the co-occurrence of both disorders and implementing intervention strategies accordingly will certainly be beneficial in clinical practice and particularly in countries with a high rate of consanguinity."

In Phase 3 clinical studies, all subjects treated with pegvaliase developed anti-drug antibodies. To specifically evaluate pegvaliase-neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) and assess impact on pegvaliase efficacy, a novel hybrid ligand-binding/tandem mass spectrometry NAb assay was developed. Analysis of Phase 3 study samples revealed that pegvaliase NAb titers developed during early treatment (≤6 months after treatment initiation), and then plateaued and persisted in the majority of subjects during late treatment (>6 months). Subjects with the lowest/undetectable NAb titers had relatively high plasma pegvaliase concentrations and experienced the most rapid decline in blood Phe concentrations at relatively low pegvaliase dose concentrations. In contrast, subjects with higher NAb titers generally had lower plasma pegvaliase concentrations on similar low doses, with little change in blood Phe concentrations. However, with additional time on treatment and individualized dose titration, the majority of subjects achieved substantial and sustained blood Phe reduction, including those with higher NAb titers. Moreover, after maturation of the anti-pegvaliase immune response, NAb titers were stable over time and did not rise in response to dose increases; thus, subjects did not require additional dose increases to maintain reduction in blood Phe."

    "abstract": "In phenylketonuria (PKU) patients, a genetic defect in the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) leads to elevated systemic phenylalanine (Phe), which can result in severe neurological impairment. As a treatment for PKU, Escherichia coli Nissle (EcN) strain SYNB1618 was developed under Synlogic's Synthetic Biotic™ platform to degrade Phe from within the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. This clinical-stage engineered strain expresses the Phe-metabolizing enzyme phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), catalyzing the deamination of Phe to the non-toxic product trans-cinnamate (TCA). In the present work, we generate a more potent EcN-based PKU strain through optimization of whole cell PAL activity, using biosensor-based high-throughput screening of mutant PAL libraries. A lead enzyme candidate from this screen is used in the construction of SYNB1934, a chromosomally integrated strain containing the additional Phe-metabolizing and biosafety features found in SYNB1618. Head-to-head, SYNB1934 demonstrates an approximate two-fold increase in in vivo PAL activity compared to SYNB1618."

    "abstract": ": To investigate the clinical significance of c.158G>A mutation.: The blood phenylalanine (Phe) was continuously monitored in 2 unrelated newborns with suspected hyperphenylalaninimia (HPA) carrying c.158G>A mutation. The cross-species conservation of the mutant amino acid was analyzed using T-Coffee. Swiss-Model software was used to construct a 3D protein structure and the impact of candidate mutations on the secondary structure of the protein product was analyzed. The population carrying rate of the p.Arg53His mutation was analyzed by literature searching. Allelic phenotype values (APV) and genotypic phenotype values (GPV) were used to predict the phenotype associated with the mutation. Two mutations of gene were detected in each newborn: c.611A>G(p.Tyr204Cys), c.158G>A(p.Arg53His) and c.1238G>C(p.Arg413Pro), c.158G>A(p.Arg53His). Two children tolerated normal diet and plasma Phe levels were within the normal range during follow-up. The mother of case 2 was homozygous with p.Arg53His mutation under the condition of long-term normal diet, and the blood Phe concentration and Phe/Tyr were all within the normal range. The mutant amino acids were not highly conserved among the 13 different species. The 3D structural model showed that p.Arg53His mutation reduced the hydrogen bond from 2 to 1 between the 53rd and 49th amino acids of PAH. The allele frequency of p.Arg53His was 0.015 08 in HPA patients and 0.001 621 in normal population, while the prevalence of p.Arg53His allele was highest in the East Asian normal population (0.013 73). The APV and GPV system predicted that the mutation was related to mild HPA(MHP) type. : The different compound heterozygous mutations of p.Arg53His lead to clinical phenotype varieties. The reduction of enzyme activity caused by the mutation of p.Arg53His is not sufficient to cause symptoms of phenylketonuria, so the mutation may be \"likely benign\"."

    "abstract": "The formation of ordered protein and peptide assemblies is a phenomenon related to a wide range of human diseases. However, the mechanism of assembly at the molecular level remains largely unknown. Minimal models enable the exploration of the underlying interactions that are at the core of such self-assembly processes. In particular, the ability of phenylalanine, a single aromatic amino acid, to form an amyloid-like structure has challenged the previous dogma viewing a peptide backbone as a prerequisite for assembly. The driving forces controlling the nucleation and assembly in the absence of a peptide backbone remain to be identified. Here, aiming to unravel these forces, we explored the kinetics and thermodynamics of three phenylalanine-containing molecules during their assembly process: the amino acid phenylalanine, which accumulates in phenylketonuria patients, the diphenylalanine core-motif of the amyloid β peptide related to Alzheimer's disease, and the extended triphenylalanine peptide which forms a range of distinct nanostructures <i>in vitro</i>. We found that the aggregation propensity, regarding the critical monomer concentration, strongly increases with size, with triphenylalanine being the most aggregation-prone species under our experimental conditions. In the context of classical nucleation theory, this increase in aggregation propensity can be attributed to the larger free energy decrease upon aggregation of larger peptides and is not due to the presence/absence of a peptide bond <i>per se</i>. Taken together, this work provides insights into the aggregation processes of chemically simple systems and suggests that both backbone-containing peptides and backbone-lacking amino acids assemble through a similar mechanism, thus supporting the classification of amino acids in the continuum of amyloid-forming building blocks."

    "abstract": "Although there is a general assumption that a phenylalanine (Phe)-restricted diet promotes overweight in patients with phenylketonuria (PKU), it is unclear if this presumption is supported by scientific evidence. This systematic review aimed to determine if patients with PKU are at a higher risk of overweight compared to healthy individuals. A literature search was carried out on PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Embase databases. Risk of bias of individual studies was assessed using the Quality Assessment Tool for Observational Cohort and Cross-Sectional Studies, and the quality of the evidence for each outcome was assessed using the NutriGrade scoring system. From 829 articles identified, 15 were included in the systematic review and 12 in the meta-analysis. Body mass index (BMI) was similar between patients with PKU and healthy controls, providing no evidence to support the idea that a Phe-restricted diet is a risk factor for the development of overweight. However, a subgroup of patients with classical PKU had a significantly higher BMI than healthy controls. Given the increasing prevalence of overweight in the general population, patients with PKU require lifelong follow-up, receiving personalised nutritional counselling, with methodical nutritional status monitoring from a multidisciplinary team in inherited metabolic disorders."

    "abstract": "Monitoring phenylalanine (Phe) concentrations is critical for the management of phenylketonuria (PKU). This can be done in dried blood spots (DBS) or in EDTA plasma derived from capillary or venous blood. Different techniques are used to measure Phe, the most common being flow-injection analysis tandem mass spectrometry (FIA-MS-MS) and ion exchange chromatography (IEC). Significant differences have been reported between Phe concentrations in various sample types measured by different techniques, the cause of which is not yet understood. We measured Phe concentrations in 240 venous blood samples from 199 patients with hyperphenylalaninemia in dried blood spots, EDTA plasma and erythrocytes by FIA-MS-MS and IEC. Phe concentrations were significantly lower in erythrocytes than in plasma leading to about 19% lower Phe DBS concentrations compared with plasma independent from the method used for quantification. As most therapy recommendations for PKU patients are based on plasma concentrations reliable conversion of DBS into plasma concentrations is necessary. Variances of Phe concentrations in plasma and DBS are not linear but increases with higher concentrations indicating heteroscedasticity. We therefore suggest the slope of the 75th percentile from quantile regression as a correction factor."

    "abstract": "The measurement of phenylalanine in biological fluids for the diagnosis of phenylketonuria (PKU) in newborns and the monitoring/therapeutic drug monitoring of individuals with PKU are especially important. Owing to the importance of PKU monitoring in clinical medicine, a new fluorometric method was developed for the determination of L-phenylalanine in serum samples. This method is based on the relationship between phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) and o-phthalaldehyde (OPA). PAL catalyzes the conversion of phenylalanine to ammonia and trans-cinnamic acid. The formed ammonia reacts with OPA in the presence of sodium sulfite, giving a fluorescent product. The presence of sulfide in an alkaline environment prevents OPA from reacting with other amino acids while allowing it to react only with ammonia. Method characterization and optimization studies, such as the effects of pH, temperature, and interferents, were carried out. The amount of L-phenylalanine in a human serum sample was successfully determined by using the fluorescence emission intensity of the fluorescent product formed as a result of the reaction between OPA and ammonia. The linear range of the method is between 10 μM and 10 mM. The obtained result showed good agreement with the results of the biochemistry analysis laboratory. Recoveries of 95.41% and 73.39% were obtained for phenylalanine and ammonia, respectively. This PAL-OPA-based fluorometric method for phenylalanine is practical, easy to operate, low cost, highly sensitive, and selective and can also be used for the simultaneous determination of ammonia in human serum samples."

Despite clinical studies describing the relevance of blood Phe to outcome in PKU patients, blood Phe does not explain the variance in neurocognitive and behavioural outcome completely. In a PKU mouse model we investigated 1) the relationship between plasma Phe and brain biochemistry (Brain Phe and monoaminergic neurotransmitter concentrations), and 2) whether blood non-Phe Large Neutral Amino Acids (LNAA) would be of additional value to blood Phe concentrations to explain brain biochemistry. To this purpose, we assessed blood amino acid concentrations and brain Phe as well as monoaminergic neurotransmitter levels in in 114 Pah-Enu2 mice on both B6 and BTBR backgrounds using (multiple) linear regression analyses. Plasma Phe concentrations were strongly correlated to brain Phe concentrations, significantly negatively correlated to brain serotonin and norepinephrine concentrations and only weakly correlated to brain dopamine concentrations. From all blood markers, Phe showed the strongest correlation to brain biochemistry in PKU mice. Including non-Phe LNAA concentrations to the multiple regression model, in addition to plasma Phe, did not help explain brain biochemistry. This study showed that blood Phe is still the best amino acid predictor of brain biochemistry in PKU. Nevertheless, neurocognitive and behavioural outcome cannot fully be explained by blood or brain Phe concentrations, necessitating a search for other additional parameters.

We analyzed data from a self-report survey in the NBS-PKU Connect online registry. We describe the participants' nutrition management strategies, barriers to management, outcomes of bone disorders, skin, and psychological co-morbidities, and the use of special education or other special services. Predictors of outcomes were identified and assessed, including the impact of sex, age, age at diagnosis, blood phenylalanine concentration, use of sapropterin, use of medical food, adherence to prescribed diet, use of low protein modified foods, whether they had ever been off-diet, and use of tyrosine supplementation. The 219 respondents included individuals with PKU or hyperphenylalanemia (n = 78), or their caregivers (n = 141). Most (84.3%) started treatment before the age of two weeks. About one-third indicated that they had been off-diet at some point in their lives, and 81.4% reported that they currently adhered to their prescribed diet, with adherence to prescribed diet decreasing with age. Blood phenylalanine concentration was under the recommended threshold of 360 μmol/L for 68.5% of participants. One-quarter of respondents reported psychological co-morbidities, with anxiety and ADD/ADHD being the most common. The incidence of psychological co-morbidities increased with age and with ever having been off diet. Special education or other special services were more likely to be reported by individuals who were diagnosed after one week of age. Skin disorders such as acne and eczema were more common in females than males, and a minority of participants reported bone disorders. Despite recommendations to maintain blood phenylalanine concentrations in the therapeutic range throughout life, it is not uncommon for adults with PKU to discontinue dietary management of their disorder. Early diagnosis was associated with reduced need for special education or other special services, and continuous treatment was associated with decreased psychological co-morbidities."

First, 18 Chinese HPA patients were analyzed by next generation sequencing (NGS) and SNaPshot in parallel. Then, the SNaPshot assay was performed to analyze the mutational spectrum of the PAH in 4,276 individuals in Eastern China. A total of 36 variants in the PAH gene were successfully identified by NGS, while the SNaPshot assay identified 34 PAH variants in these patients. Thus, the SNaPshot assay achieved the sensitivity and specificity of 91.6% and 100.0%, respectively. Furthermore, the carrier rate was approximately 1 in 58 (1.73%) in 4,276 individuals, and c.728G > A was the most common variant.

Retinal layers in 19 patients with PKU, 15 patients with GD3, and 93 healthy individuals were measured using peripapillary ring scan and macular SD-OCT. Linear mixed models were computed including an adjustment for age, sex, and spherical equivalent. We calculated Spearman's rank correlations between retinal layer measurements and clinical and/or laboratory parameters. Thinning of total retinal thickness was found in the macular inner ring (p = 0.002), and outer ring (p = 0.012), sparing the fovea (p = 0.12) in PKU, while in GD3, all subfields were thinned (fovea p < 0.001, inner ring p = 0.047, outer ring 0.07). In both conditions, thinning was most evident in the NFL, GCL, and IPL, while OPL (outer plexiform layer) was thickened. Peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer measurements remained normal. GCL and IPL in PKU correlated with tyrosine serum concentration. Thinning of the NFL, GCL, and IPL, with thickened OPL, are both found in PKU and in GD3. Low dopamine concentrations in the retina might promote these effects. However, these data do not give evidence that retinal measurements can be used as a biomarker for disease severity in patients with GD3."

To date, data on incidence and prevalence of IMDs are limited. Taking advantage of a functioning network within the Austrian metabolic group, our registry research aimed to update the data of the \"Registry for Inherited Metabolic Disorders\" started between 1985 and 1995 with retrospectively retrieved data on patients with IMDs according to the Society for the Study of Inborn Errors of Metabolism International Classification of Diseases 11 (SSIEM ICD11) catalogue. Included in this retrospective register were 2631 patients with an IMD according to the SSIEM ICD11 Classification, who were treated in Austria.

Moreover, by pooling expertise it prospectively improves patient treatment, similar to pediatric oncology protocols. A substantial requirement for ful filling this goal is to regularly update the registry and provide nationwide coverage with inclusion of all medical specialties."

    "abstract": "La fenilcetonuria y otras hiperfenilalaninemias son enfermedades genéticas cuya detección actualmente es obligatoria en México, tanto en el sector público como en el privado. La detección y el tratamiento oportunos han demostrado prevenir las manifestaciones neurológicas y la discapacidad que caracterizan esta enfermedad. Por ello, es de suma importancia que el pediatra y el personal de salud involucrados en la atención de estos pacientes conozcan, comprendan e implementen el manejo nutricional de manera correcta. Aunque existen varios tratamientos, el más utilizado es la restricción dietética de fenilalanina. El tratamiento nutricio incluye el uso de la llamada «fórmula médica» o «fórmula metabólica sin fenilalanina», la cual fue concebida desde el primer tercio del siglo XX. Posteriormente, se han realizado múltiples estudios y modificaciones con el fin de mejorar el pronóstico de los pacientes. El presente trabajo describe las principales características y diferencias entre las fórmulas libres de fenilalanina de seguimiento disponibles en México, para que el personal de salud cuente con elementos para su correcta prescripción."

    "title": "Nitrogen Balance after the Administration of a Prolonged-Release Protein Substitute for Phenylketonuria as a Single Dose in Healthy Volunteers.",
    "abstract": "Nitrogen balance is the difference between nitrogen excreted as urea and nitrogen ingested, mainly in proteins. Increased circulating concentrations of amino acids (AA) in the bloodstream are usually associated with proportional increases in the production and excretion of urea. Previously, we reported results from a randomized, controlled, single-dose, crossover trial in healthy adult volunteers (n = 30) (Trial Registration: ISRCTN11016729), in which a Test product (prolonged-release AA mixture formulated with Physiomimic Technology™ (PT™)) significantly slowed down the release and reduced the peak plasma concentrations of essential AAs compared with a free AA mixture (Reference product) while maintaining essential AA bioavailability. Here, we report an assessment of the nitrogen balance from the same study. The amount of nitrogen contained in plasma AAs, levels of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) (<i>p</i> < 0.0001) and changes in BUN (<i>p</i> < 0.0001) were smaller after the Test product compared with the Reference product. These findings suggest that the production of urea in proportion to systemic AA availability was significantly smaller after the administration of the Test product compared with the Reference product and that the test product conferred the increased utilization of AAs for protein synthesis and reduced their oxidation and conversion to urea. In the clinical setting, it is possible that the effects of PT™ observed on the disposition of free AAs in this study may translate to health benefits in terms of physiological body composition and growth if used for the treatment of subjects with phenylketonuria (PKU). Further investigation in patients with PKU is warranted."

    "abstract": "Blood phenylalanine (Phe) is used as the primary marker to evaluate metabolic control. Our study aimed to describe the metabolic control of patients with phenylketonuria (PKU) comparing three different treatment recommendations (European guidelines/US guidelines/Portuguese consensus). This was a retrospective, observational, single centre study in patients with PKU collecting data on blood Phe levels from 2017. Nutritional intake data and sapropterin (BH4) prescription were collected at the last appointment of 2017. The final sample studied included 87 patients (48% females) [13 hyperphenylalaninemia; 47 mild PKU; 27 classical PKU] with a median age of 18 y (range: 1-36 y). The median number of blood Phe measurements for patients was 21 (range: 6-89). In patients aged < 12 y, the median blood Phe level was 300 μmol/L (range 168-480) and 474 μmol/L (range 156-1194) for patients ≥ 12 y. Overall, a median of 83% of blood Phe levels were within the European PKU guidelines target range. In patients aged ≥ 12 years, there was a higher median % of blood Phe levels within the European PKU guidelines target range (≥12 y: 84% vs. <12 y: 56%). In children < 12 y with classical PKU (<i>n =</i> 2), only 34% of blood Phe levels were within target range for all 3 guidelines and 49% with mild PKU (<i>n =</i> 11). Girls had better control than boys (89% vs. 66% median Phe levels within European Guidelines). Although it is clear that 50% or more patients were unable to achieve acceptable metabolic control on current treatment options, a globally agreed upper Phe target associated with optimal outcomes for age groups is necessary. More studies need to examine how clinics with dissimilar resources, different therapeutic Phe targets and frequency of monitoring relate to metabolic control."

    "abstract": "For many years, the main nitrogen source for patients with phenylketonuria (PKU) was phenylalanine-free amino acid supplements. Recently, casein glycomacropeptide (GMP) supplements have been prescribed due to its functional and sensorial properties. Nevertheless, many doubts still persist about the metabolic effects of GMP compared to free amino acids (fAA) and intact proteins such as casein (CAS). We endeavour to compare, in rats, the metabolic effects of different nitrogen sources. Twenty-four male Wistar rats were fed equal energy density diets plus CAS (control, <i>n</i> = 8), fAA (<i>n</i> = 8) or GMP (<i>n</i> = 8) for 8 weeks. Food, liquid intake and body weight were measured weekly. Blood biochemical parameters and markers of glycidic metabolism were assessed. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) was analysed by ELISA and immunohistochemistry. Food intake was higher in rats fed CAS compared to fAA or GMP throughout the treatment period. Fluid intake was similar between rats fed fAA and GMP. Body weight was systematically lower in rats fed fAA and GMP compared to those fed CAS, and still, from week 4 onwards, there were differences between fAA and GMP. None of the treatments appeared to induce consistent changes in glycaemia, while insulin levels were significantly higher in GMP. Likewise, the production of GLP-1 was higher in rats fed GMP when compared to fAA. Decreased urea, total protein and triglycerides were seen both in fAA and GMP related to CAS. GMP also reduced albumin and triglycerides in comparison to CAS and fAA, respectively. The chronic consumption of the diets triggers different metabolic responses which may provide clues to further study potential underlying mechanisms."

    "abstract": "Urea cycle disorders (UCDs) are a group of rare inherited metabolic diseases causing hyperammonemic encephalopathy. Despite intensive dietary and pharmacological therapy, outcome is poor in a subset of UCD patients. Reducing ammonia production by changing faecal microbiome in UCD is an attractive treatment approach. We compared faecal microbiome composition of 10 UCD patients, 10 healthy control subjects and 10 phenylketonuria (PKU) patients. PKU patients on a low protein diet were included to differentiate between the effect of a low protein diet and the UCD itself on microbial composition. Participants were asked to collect a faecal sample and to fill out a 24 h dietary journal. DNA was extracted from faecal material, taxonomy was assigned and microbiome data was analyzed, with a focus on microbiota involved in ammonia metabolism.In this study we show an altered faecal microbiome in UCD patients, different from both PKU and healthy controls. UCD patients on dietary and pharmacological treatment had a less diverse faecal microbiome, and the faecal microbiome of PKU patients on a protein restricted diet with amino acid supplementation showed reduced richness compared to healthy adults without a specific diet. The differences in the microbiome composition of UCD patients compared to healthy controls were in part related to lactulose use. Other genomic process encodings involved in ammonia metabolism, did not seem to differ. Since manipulation of the microbiome is possible, this could be a potential treatment modality. We propose as a first next step, to study the impact of these faecal microbiome alterations on metabolic stability. The faecal microbiome of UCD patients was less diverse compared to PKU patients and even more compared to healthy controls."

    "abstract": "To gain insight into the potential protective mechanisms of low phenylalanine diet (LPD) in phenylketonuria (PKU), gene expression profiles were studied in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of a PKU mouse model (BTBR-Pah<sup>enu2</sup>). PKU mice were fed with low Phe diet (LPD-PKU group) and normal diet (PKU group). Wild-type mice were treated with normal diet (WT group) as control. After 12 weeks, we detected gene expression in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of the three groups by RNA-sequencing, and then screened the differentially-expressed genes (DEGs) among the groups by bioinformatics analyses. We found that the transcriptional profiles of both cerebral cortex and hippocampus changed markedly between PKU and WT mice. Furthermore, LPD changed the transcriptional profiles of the cerebral cortex and the hippocampus of PKU mice significantly, especially in the cerebral cortex, with overlaps of genes that changed with the disease and altered by LPD treatment. In the cerebral cortex, hundreds of DEGs enriched in a wide spectrum of biological processes, molecular function, and cellular component, including nervous system development, axon development and guidance, calcium ion binding, modulation of chemical synaptic transmission, and regulation of protein kinase activity. In the hippocampus, the overlapping genes were enriched in positive regulation of long term synaptic, negative regulation of excitatory postsynaptic potential, positive regulation of synapse assembly. Our results showed that genes impaired in PKU and then rescued by LPD might indicate the potential protective capability of LPD in the PKU brain."

    "title": "Protein status of people with phenylketonuria: a scoping review protocol.",
    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a disorder of protein metabolism resulting in an accumulation of phenylalanine in the body. Dietary management consists of altering the sources of ingested protein to limit phenylalanine intake. Current dietary protein guidelines for PKU are based on limited scientific evidence, thus it remains unclear whether current practice leads to optimal protein status in people with PKU. To date, no attempt has been made to systematically evaluate the protein status of people with PKU, using a combination of validated anthropometric, biochemical and functional measurement tools. Furthermore, factors known to influence protein status in the general population warrant consideration when determining protein status in individuals with PKU, alongside factors unique to PKU such as the type of protein substitute consumed. Understanding the impact of these variables on protein status is crucial to developing a personalised approach to protein recommendations for optimising health and functional outcomes in people with PKU. Therefore, the aim of this scoping review is to examine existing evidence regarding the protein status of people with PKU, and to investigate the nutritional and lifestyle variables that influence protein status. This review will be guided by Arksey and O'Malley's framework, along with guidance from Levac <i>et al</i>, Pawliuk <i>et al</i> and the Joanna Briggs Institute. The following databases will be searched: MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase, CENTRAL, Web of Science and Scopus, alongside grey literature. Identified literature will be assessed by two independent reviewers for inclusion. Descriptive numerical analysis will be performed and a narrative summary will accompany the tabulated results describing how study findings relate to the review questions. This review protocol does not require ethical approval. Findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publication, presented at relevant conferences, and shared with a patient research advisory group to inform discussions on future research."

    "abstract": "Core outcome sets (COS) are lists of consensus-determined outcomes to be measured and reported in all clinical research studies within a disease area. While including patients and families in COS development to improve their relevance and applicability to patient values is key, there is limited literature documenting practical barriers and facilitators to successful patient engagement in COS development. In this paper, as researchers and patient partners, we provide a resource for COS developers to meaningfully and effectively engage patients and families. To establish a consensus-based COS for children with two inherited metabolic diseases (medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency and phenylketonuria), we conducted an evidence review, Delphi survey, and workshop. Two adult patient partner co-investigators co-developed the study protocol, co-designed strategies to address challenges with incorporating patient perspectives, and led all patient engagement activities, including communication with a group of family advisors. Seven adult family advisors received training about COS development and subsequently contributed to Delphi survey development, outcome definitions, the consensus workshop, and selection of outcome measurement instruments. Patient partner co-investigators and family advisors were essential to the successful design, conduct, and completion of the two COS. Patient partner co-investigators supported the understanding, inclusion and engagement of family advisors, and helped develop accessible tools to determine patient-oriented outcome measurement instruments. Patient partner co-investigators and family advisors collaborated with the study team to co-develop surveys, modify technical language, and recruit participants to the study. Together, we addressed challenges to patient engagement in COS development such as unfamiliarity with study methods, comprehensibility of materials and ongoing engagement, and power imbalances between team members. Our approach to patient and family engagement in COS development for two rare conditions for children was feasible and considered valuable by all study team members, including patients and family members, in improving the relevance of the deliverable to patients. This approach to patient engagement in developing COS can be applied to other paediatric disease contexts, allowing patient and family perspectives to influence the direction of future studies to develop COS."

    "abstract": "Inborn errors of metabolism (IEMs) refer to rare heterogeneous genetic disorders with various clinical manifestations that can cause serious physical and psychological sequelae. Results of previous studies on the impact of an IEM on health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) were incongruent and only few studies considered more broadly the psychological well-being of children with IEM and their families. Our objectives were to examine: (1) the impact of the IEM severity on the HR-QoL and psychological functioning of patients and their parents at baseline; and (2) its evolution over time; and (3) the correlation between parental and children's perspectives. <b>Methods</b>: The sample included 69 pediatric patients (mean age = 7.55 y, SD = 4.59) with evaluations at baseline and after one year. We collected data on HR-QoL, child mental health and emotional regulation as well as on parental mood and stress using different validated questionnaires. IEM severity was rated by a clinician through the biological subdomain of the pediatric INTERMED instrument. <b>Results</b>: Two groups of patients based on IEM severity scores were created (<i>n</i> = 31 with low and <i>n</i> = 38 with moderate/high IEM severity). The two groups differed with respect to age, diet and supplement intake. IEM severity had an impact on HR-QoL and behavioral symptoms in children, as well as on HR-QoL and stress in parents. For patients with moderate/high IEM severity, child and parental HR-QoL improved after 1-year of follow-up. We did not observe any significant difference between evaluations by patients versus parents. <b>Conclusions</b>: Our findings demonstrate that moderate/high IEM severity altered child and parental psychological well-being, but also revealed a significant improvement after one-year follow-up. This observation suggests that patients with a moderate/high IEM severity and their families benefit from the care of an interdisciplinary team including a child psychologist specialized in IEMs. Moreover, in patients with higher IEM severity there may also be more room for improvement compared to patients with low IEM severity. Future studies should focus on observations over a larger time span, particularly during adolescence, and should include objective measurements."

    "abstract": "In phenylketonuria, treatment and subsequent lowering of phenylalanine levels usually occur within the first month of life. This study investigated whether different indicators of metabolic control during the neonatal period were associated with IQ during late childhood/early adolescence. Overall phenylalanine concentration during the first month of life (total \"area under the curve\"), proportion of phenylalanine concentrations above upper target level (360 μmol/L) and proportion below lower target level (120 μmol/L) during this period, diagnostic phenylalanine levels, number of days until phenylalanine levels were <360 μmol/L, and lifetime and concurrent phenylalanine levels were correlated with IQ scores of 64 PKU patients (mean age 10.8 years, SD 2.9). Overall phenylalanine concentration and proportion of phenylalanine concentrations >360 μmol/L during the first month of life negatively correlated with IQ in late childhood/early adolescence. Separately, phenylalanine concentrations during different periods within the first month of life (0-10 days, 11-20 days, 21-30 days) were negatively correlated with later IQ as well, but correlation strengths did not differ significantly. No further significant associations were found. In phenylketonuria, achievement of target-range phenylalanine levels during the neonatal period is important for cognition later in life, also when compared to other indicators of metabolic control. In phenylketonuria, it remains unclear during which age periods or developmental stages metabolic control is most important for later cognitive outcomes. Phenylalanine levels during the neonatal period were clearly and negatively related to later IQ, whereas no significant associations were observed for other indices of metabolic control. This emphasizes the relative importance of this period for cognitive development in phenylketonuria. No further distinctions were observed in strength of associations with later IQ between different indicators of metabolic control during the neonatal period. Thus, achievement of good metabolic control within 1 month after birth appears \"safe\" with respect to later cognitive outcomes."

    "abstract": "Congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) are a widely acknowledged group of metabolic diseases. PMM2-CDG is the most frequently diagnosed CDG with a prevalence as high as one in 20,000. In contrast, the prevalence of other CDG types remains unknown. This study aimed to analyze the estimated prevalence of different N-linked protein glycosylation disorders. We extracted allele frequencies for diverse populations from The Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD), encompassing variant frequency information from 141,456 individuals. To identify pathogenic variants, we used the ClinVar database as a primary source. High confidence loss-of-function variants as defined by the LOFTEE algorithm were also classified as pathogenic. After summing up population frequencies for pathogenic alleles, estimated disease birth prevalence values with confidence intervals were calculated using the Bayesian method. We first validated our approach using two more common recessive disorders (cystic fibrosis and phenylketonuria) by showing that the estimated prevalences calculated from population allele frequencies were in accordance with previously published epidemiological studies. Among assessed 27 autosomal recessive N-glycosylation disorders, the only disease with estimated birth prevalence higher than one in 100,000 was PMM2-CDG (in both, all gnomAD individuals and those with European ancestry). The combined prevalence of 27 different N-glycosylation disorders was around one in 22,000 Europeans but varied considerably across populations. We will show estimated prevalence data from diverse populations and explain the possible pitfalls of this analysis. Still, we are confident that these data will guide CDG research and clinical care to identify CDG across populations."

Improving parents' and patients' knowledge and competence about the diet enables them to make appropriate food choices.

We developed a 44-item online survey aimed at health professionals. After a pilot test, the final version was sent to 25 practitioners working with inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) in 14 countries. Our results include 22 centers in 13 countries. Most countries (12/13) screened newborns for PKU. Phenylalanine (Phe) targets at different ages were very heterogeneous among centers, with greater consistency at the 0-1 year age group (14/22 sought 120-240 µmol/L) and the lowest at >12 years (10 targets reported). Most countries had only unflavored powdered amino acid substitutes (10/13) and did not have low-protein foods (8/13). Only 3/13 countries had regional databases of the Phe content of foods, and only 4/22 centers had nutrient analysis software. The perceived obstacles to treatment were: low purchasing power (62%), limited/insufficient availability of low-protein foods (60%), poor adherence, and lack of technical resources to manage the diet (50% each). We observed a heterogeneous scenario in the dietary management of PKU, and most countries experienced a lack of dietary resources for both patients and health professionals."

In this cross-sectional study, a validated liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS) method was used for urinary PAG quantification in 35 participants with hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA) and 33 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. We have found that (a) PKU patients present higher urine PAG levels than healthy control subjects, and that (b) there is a significant correlation between urine PAG and circulating Phe levels in patients with HPA. In addition, we show a significant strong correlation between Phe levels from venous blood samples and from capillary finger-prick dried blood spot (DBS) samples collected at the same time in patients with HPA. Further research in order to assess the potential role of urine PAG as a non-invasive biomarker in PKU is warranted."

Osteopenia in PKU might reflect a therapeutic diet, with reduced bone forming materials. However, osteopenia occurs in patients who never received dietary therapy or following short-term therapy. Humans and animal studies find no correlation between bone loss, plasma hyperphenylalaninemia, bone formation, and resorption markers. Work in the Pah<sup>enu2</sup> mouse recently showed a mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) developmental defect in the osteoblast pathway. Specifically, Pah<sup>enu2</sup> MSCs are affected by energy dysregulation and oxidative stress. In PKU, MSCs oximetry and respirometry show mitochondrial respiratory-chain complex 1 deficit and over-representation of superoxide, producing reactive oxygen species affecting mitochondrial function. Similar mechanisms are involved in aging bone and other rare defects including alkaptonuria and homocysteinemia. Novel interventions to support energy and reduce oxidative stress may restore bone formation PKU patients, and in metabolic diseases with related mechanisms."

    "abstract": "To present a case series that illustrates real-world use of pegvaliase based on the initial experiences of US healthcare providers. Sixteen healthcare providers from 14 centers across the US with substantial clinical experience in treating patients with phenylketonuria (PKU) with pegvaliase in the two-plus years since FDA approval (May 2018) provided cases that exemplified important lessons from their initial experiences treating patients with pegvaliase. Key lessons from each case and takeaway points were discussed in both live and virtual meetings. Fifteen cases of adults with PKU (eight males, seven females), representing a spectrum of age (18 to 53 years), previous PKU care, comorbidities, and socioeconomic situations were reviewed and discussed. Full extended case reports are included in the Supplement. The cases showed that treating patients with a daily injectable can be challenging due to a patient's financial problems, treatment challenges, and neuropsychological and psychiatric comorbidities, which can be identified before starting pegvaliase, but do not prohibit successful treatment. The authors agreed that patient education on adverse events (AEs), time to efficacy, dietary changes, and food preparation is an ongoing process that should start prior to initiating pegvaliase treatment. Treatment goals and planned dietary changes once efficacy is reached should be defined prior to treatment initiation and re-evaluated throughout the course of therapy. Each patient's titration schedule and dietary adjustments are unique, depending on occurrence of AEs and individual goals of treatment. Despite the AE profile of pegvaliase, all but two patients remained motivated to continue treatment and achieved efficacy (except one patient in whom titration was still ongoing). AEs occurring early in the treatment pathway may require prolongation of the titration phase and/or concomitant medication use, but do not seem indicative of future tolerability or eventual efficacy. Close follow-up of patients during titration and maintenance to help with dietary changes is important. This case series provides real-world experience on the use of pegvaliase. Until data from registries and independent research become available, the data presented herein can support appropriate management of patients receiving pegvaliase in clinical practice."

We aim herein to characterize the cardiac phenotype of adult subjects with phenylketonuria using advanced cardiac imaging. Methods and Results Thirty-nine adult patients with phenylketonuria (age, 30.5±8.7 years; 10-year mean phenylalanine concentration, 924±330 µmol/L) and 39 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were investigated. Participants underwent a comprehensive cardiac magnetic resonance and echocardiography examination. Ten-year mean plasma levels of phenylalanine and tyrosine were used to quantify disease activity and adherence to treatment. Patients with phenylketonuria had thinner left ventricular walls (septal end-diastolic thickness, 7.0±17 versus 8.8±1.7 mm [<i>P</i><0.001]; lateral thickness, 6.1±1.4 versus 6.8±1.2 mm [<i>P</i>=0.004]), more dilated left ventricular cavity (end-diastolic volume, 87±14 versus 80±14 mL/m<sup>2</sup> [<i>P</i>=0.0178]; end-systolic volume, 36±9 versus 29±8 mL/m<sup>2</sup> [<i>P</i><0.001]), lower ejection fraction (59±6% versus 64±6% [<i>P</i><0.001]), reduced systolic deformation (global circumferential strain, -29.9±4.2 % versus -32.2±5.0 % [<i>P</i>=0.027]), and lower left ventricular mass (38.2±7.9 versus 47.8±11.0 g/m<sup>2</sup> [<i>P</i><0.001]). T1 native values were decreased (936±53 versus 996±26 ms [<i>P</i><0.001]), with particular low values in patients with phenylalanine >1200 µmol/L (909±48 ms). Both mean phenylalanine (<i>P</i>=0.013) and tyrosine (<i>P</i>=0.035) levels were independently correlated with T1; and in a multiple regression model, higher phenylalanine levels and higher left ventricular mass associate with lower T1. Conclusions Cardiac phenotype of adult patients with phenylketonuria reveals some traits of an early-stage cardiomyopathy. Regular cardiology follow-up, tighter therapeutic control, and prophylaxis of cardiovascular risk factors, in particular dyslipidemia, are recommended."

    "title": "Phenylalanine Interacts with Oleic Acid-Based Vesicle Membrane. Understanding the Molecular Role of Fibril-Vesicle Interaction under the Context of Phenylketonuria.",
    "abstract": "In the present contribution, on the basis of a spectroscopic and microscopic investigation, the characterization and photophysics of various assemblies of oleic acid/oleate solution at three pH values, namely, 8.28, 9.72, and 11.77, were explored. The variation in the dynamic response of aqua molecules in and around the assemblies has been interrogated by a picoseconds solvation dynamics experiment using a time-correlated single-photon counting setup employing coumarin-153 as a probe. On the one hand, the time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy measurement along with the fluorescence correlation spectroscopy experiment was executed to extract information regarding the comparison of the extent of the internal restricted confinement of these assemblies. On the other hand, an effort to investigate the cross-interaction between the self-assembled architectures of l-phenylalanine (l-Phe), responsible for phenylketonuria (PKU) disorder, and the oleic acid at the vesicle-forming pH established that the l-Phe fibrillar morphologies strongly alter the dynamic properties of the vesicle membrane formed by the oleic acid. Specifically, the interaction of the l-Phe assemblies with the oleic acid vesicle membrane is found to introduce the flexibility of the vesicle membrane and alter the hydration properties of the membrane. To track the fibril-induced alterations of the oleic acid vesicle properties, various spectroscopic and microscopic investigations were performed. The mutual reconciliation of the experimental outputs, therefore, portrays the state of the art, which accounts for the fibril-induced alterations of the properties of the oleic acid vesicle membrane, the mimicking setup of the cellular membrane, thereby informing us that alterations of such a property of the membrane should be taken into active consideration during the rational development of therapeutic modulators against disorders like PKU."

    "abstract": "In classical phenylketonuria (PKU) phenylalanine (Phe) accumulates due to functional impairment of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase caused by pathogenic variants in the PAH gene. PKU treatment prevents severe cognitive impairment. Blood Phe concentration is the main biochemical monitoring parameter. Between appointments and venous blood sampling, Austrian PKU patients send dried blood spots (DBS) for Phe measurements to their centre. Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), caused by the SARS CoV-2 virus, was classified as a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020. In Austria, two nationwide lockdowns were installed during the first and second pandemic wave with variable regional and national restrictions in between. This retrospective questionnaire study compared the frequency of Phe measurements and Phe concentrations during lockdown with the respective period of the previous year in children and adolescents with PKU and explored potential influencing factors. 77 patients (30 female, 47 male; mean age 12.4 [8-19] years in 2020) from five centres were included. The decline of venous samples taken on appointments in 2020 did not reach significance but the number of patients with none or only one DBS tripled from 4 (5.2%) in 2019 to 12 (15.6%) in 2020. Significantly more patients had a decline than a rise in the number of DBS sent in between 2019 and 2020 (p < 0.001; Chi<sup>2</sup> = 14.79). Especially patients ≥ 16 years sent significantly less DBS in 2020 (T = 156, p = 0.02, r = 0.49). In patients who adhered to DBS measurements, Phe concentrations remained stable. Male or female sex and dietary only versus dietary plus sapropterin treatment did not influence frequency of measurements and median Phe. During the COVID pandemic, the number of PKU patients who stopped sending DBS to their metabolic centre increased significantly, especially among those older than 16 years. Those who kept up sending DBS maintained stable Phe concentrations. Our follow-up system, which is based on DBS sent in by patients to trigger communication with the metabolic team served adherent patients well. It failed, however, to actively retrieve patients who stopped or reduced Phe measurements."

    "title": "Unusual Aggregates Formed by the Self-Assembly of Proline, Hydroxyproline, and Lysine.",
    "abstract": "There is a plethora of significant research that illustrates toxic self-assemblies formed by the aggregation of single amino acids, such as phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan, cysteine, and methionine, and their implication on the etiology of inborn errors of metabolisms (IEMs), such as phenylketonuria, tyrosinemia, hypertryptophanemia, cystinuria, and hypermethioninemia, respectively. Hence, studying the aggregation behavior of single amino acids is very crucial from the chemical neuroscience perspective to understanding the common etiology between single amino acid metabolite disorders and amyloid diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. Herein we report the aggregation properties of nonaromatic single amino acids l-proline (Pro), l-hydroxyproline (Hyp), and l-lysine hydrochloride (Lys). The morphologies of the self-assembled structures formed by Pro, Hyp, and Lys were extensively studied by various microscopic techniques, and controlled morphological transitions were observed under varied concentrations and aging times. The mechanism of structure formation was deciphered by concentration-dependent <sup>1</sup>H NMR analysis, which revealed the crucial role of hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions in the structure formation of Pro, Hyp, and Lys. MTT assays on neural (SHSY5Y) cell lines revealed that aggregates formed by Pro, Hyp, and Lys reduced cell viability in a dose-dependent manner. These results may have important implications in the understanding of the patho-physiology of disorders such as hyperprolinemia, hyperhydroxyprolinemia, and hyperlysinemia since all these IEMs are associated with severe neurodegenerative symptoms, including intellectual disability, seizures, and psychiatric problems. Our future studies will endeavor to study these biomolecular assemblies in greater detail by immuno-histochemical analysis and advanced biophysical assays."

    "abstract": "Inborn errors of metabolism (IEMs) often causing progressive and irreversible neurological damage, physical and intellectual development lag or even death, and serious harm to the family and society. The screening of neonatal IEMs by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) is an effective method for early diagnosis and presymptomatic treatment to prevent severe permanent sequelae and death. A total of 111,986 healthy newborns and 7,461 hospitalized high-risk infants were screened for IEMs using MS/MS to understand the characteristics of IEMs and related gene mutations in newborns and high-risk infants in Liuzhou. Positive samples were analyzed by Sanger sequencing or next-generation sequencing. The results showed that the incidence of IEMs in newborns in the Liuzhou area was 1/3,733, and the incidence of IEMs in high-risk infants was 1/393. Primary carnitine deficiency (1/9,332), phenylketonuria (1/18,664), and isovaleric acidemia (1/37,329) ranked the highest in neonates, while citrullinemia type II ranked the highest in high-risk infants (1/1,865). Further, 56 mutations of 17 IEMs-related genes were found in 49 diagnosed children. Among these, <i>HPD</i> c.941T > C, <i>CBS</i> c.1465C > T, <i>ACADS</i> c.337G > A, c.1195C > T, <i>ETFA</i> c.737G > T, <i>MMACHC</i> 1076bp deletion, <i>PCCB</i> c.132-134delGACinsAT, <i>IVD</i> c.548C > T, c.757A > G, <i>GCDH</i> c.1060G > T, and <i>HMGCL</i> c.501C > G were all unreported variants. Some related hotspot mutations were found, including <i>SLC22A5</i> c.51C > G, <i>PAH</i> c.1223G > A, <i>IVD</i> c.1208A > G, <i>ACADS</i> c.625G > A, and <i>GCDH</i> c.532G > A. These results show that the overall incidence of IEMs in the Liuzhou area is high. Hence, the scope of IEMs screening and publicity and education should be expanded for a clear diagnosis in the early stage of the disease."

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a rare, treatable inborn error of metabolism with frequent neurological and neuropsychiatric complications, especially in undiagnosed or insufficiently treated individuals. Given the wide range of clinical presentations and the importance of treatment implications, we here delineate the neurological and neuropsychiatric symptom spectrum in a large cohort of previously unreported adults with late-treated PKU. We consecutively evaluated late-treated PKU cases and pooled clinical and paraclinical data, including video-material, from three centers with expertise in complex movement disorders, inborn errors of metabolism and pediatrics. 26 individuals were included (10 females, median age 52 years). Developmental delay and intellectual disability were omnipresent with severe impairment of expressive communication noted in 50% of cases. Movement disorders were prevalent (77%), including tremor (38%, mostly postural), stereotypies (38%), and tics (19%). One case had neurodegenerative levodopa-responsive parkinsonism. Mild ataxia was noted in 54% of cases and 31% had a history of seizures. Neuropsychiatric characteristics included obsessive-compulsive (35%) and self-injurious behaviors (31%), anxiety (27%), depression (19%) and features compatible with those observed in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (19%). Neuroimaging revealed mild white matter changes. Adherence to dietary treatment was inconsistent in the majority of cases, particularly throughout adolescence. A history of movement disorders, particularly tremor, stereotypies and tics, in the presence of developmental delay, intellectual disability and neuropsychiatric features, such as obsessive-compulsive and self-injurious behaviors in adults should prompt the diagnostic consideration of PKU. Initiation and adherence to (dietary) treatment can ameliorate the severity of these symptoms."

    "abstract": "Polymeric-based nano drug delivery systems have been widely exploited to overcome protein instability during formulation. Presently, a diverse range of polymeric agents can be used, among which polysaccharides, such as chitosan (CS), hyaluronic acid (HA) and cyclodextrins (CDs), are included. Due to its unique biological and physicochemical properties, CS is one of the most used polysaccharides for development of protein delivery systems. However, CS has been described as potentially immunogenic. By envisaging a biosafe cytocompatible and haemocompatible profile, this paper reports the systematic development of a delivery system based on CS and derived with HA and CDs to nanoencapsulate the model human phenylalanine hydroxylase (hPAH) through ionotropic gelation with tripolyphosphate (TPP), while maintaining protein stability and enzyme activity. By merging the combined set of biopolymers, we were able to effectively entrap hPAH within CS nanoparticles with improvements in hPAH stability and the maintenance of functional activity, while simultaneously achieving strict control of the formulation process. Detailed characterization of the developed nanoparticulate systems showed that the lead formulations were internalized by hepatocytes (HepG2 cell line), did not reveal cell toxicity and presented a safe haemocompatible profile."

Here, we demonstrate that the mouse lncRNA <i>Pair</i> and human <i>HULC</i> associate with phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH). <i>Pair</i>-knockout mice exhibited excessive blood phenylalanine (Phe), musty odor, hypopigmentation, growth retardation, and progressive neurological symptoms including seizures, which faithfully models human PKU. <i>HULC</i> depletion led to reduced PAH enzymatic activities in human induced pluripotent stem cell-differentiated hepatocytes. Mechanistically, <i>HULC</i> modulated the enzymatic activities of PAH by facilitating PAH-substrate and PAH-cofactor interactions. To develop a therapeutic strategy for restoring liver lncRNAs, we designed GalNAc-tagged lncRNA mimics that exhibit liver enrichment.

    "abstract": "During the initial 26-week SPARK (Safety Paediatric efficAcy phaRmacokinetic with Kuvan®) study, addition of sapropterin dihydrochloride (Kuvan®; a synthetic formulation of the natural cofactor for phenylalanine hydroxylase, tetrahydrobiopterin; BH<sub>4</sub>), to a phenylalanine (Phe)-restricted diet, led to a significant improvement in Phe tolerance versus a Phe-restricted diet alone in patients aged 0-4 years with BH<sub>4</sub>-responsive phenylketonuria (PKU) or mild hyperphenylalaninaemia (HPA). Based on these results, the approved indication for sapropterin in Europe was expanded to include patients < 4 years of age. Herein, we present results of the SPARK extension study (NCT01376908), evaluating the long-term safety, dietary Phe tolerance, blood Phe concentrations and neurodevelopmental outcomes in patients < 4 years of age at randomisation, over an additional 36 months of treatment with sapropterin. All 51 patients who completed the 26-week SPARK study period entered the extension period. Patients who were previously treated with a Phe-restricted diet only ('sapropterin extension' group; n = 26), were initiated on sapropterin at 10 mg/kg/day, which could be increased up to 20 mg/kg/day. Patients previously treated with sapropterin plus Phe-restricted diet, remained on this regimen in the extension period ('sapropterin continuous' group; n = 25). Dietary Phe tolerance increased significantly at the end of the study versus baseline (week 0), by 38.7 mg/kg/day in the 'sapropterin continuous' group (95% CI 28.9, 48.6; p < 0.0001). In the 'sapropterin extension' group, a less pronounced effect was observed, with significant differences versus baseline (week 27) only observed between months 9 and 21; dietary Phe tolerance at the end of study increased by 5.5 mg/kg/day versus baseline (95% CI - 2.8, 13.8; p = 0.1929). Patients in both groups had normal neuromotor development and growth parameters. Long-term treatment with sapropterin plus a Phe-restricted diet in patients who initiated sapropterin at < 4 years of age with BH<sub>4</sub>-responsive PKU or mild HPA maintained improvements in dietary Phe tolerance over 3.5 years. These results continue to support the favourable risk/benefit profile for sapropterin in paediatric patients (< 4 years of age) with BH<sub>4</sub>-responsive PKU. Frequent monitoring of blood Phe levels and careful titration of dietary Phe intake to ensure adequate levels of protein intake is necessary to optimise the benefits of sapropterin treatment.

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to assess the long-term safety and efficacy of sapropterin in a real-world setting in Japanese patients with tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4)-responsive phenylketonuria. This post-marketing surveillance study enrolled all of the patients in Japan with confirmed BH4-responsive PKU who were administrated sapropterin between July 2008 and October 2017. Patients were observed at least every 3 months during follow up, with key data collected on treatment exposure/duration, effectiveness according to physician's judgement, serum phenylalanine levels, and adverse events. Of 87 enrolled patients, 85 patients (male, 42.4%; outpatients, 96.5%) were included in the safety and efficacy analysis sets. Treatment started at age <4 years in 43 (50.6%) patients and the most common starting daily dose was 5-10 mg/kg (n = 41, 48.2%) with the overall duration of treatment between 0.2 and 17.2 years. Serum phenylalanine levels, according to loading tests, reduced from a baseline level of 9.66 mg/dL (range 0.48-36.80 mg/dL) by >30% in 84 patients. Treatment was deemed effective in 79 of 85 patients (92.9%, 95% confidence interval: 85.3-97.4). One patient (1.2%) experienced an adverse drug reaction (alanine aminotransferase increased) 50 days after the start of administration, which resolved without complications with continued treatment. Sapropterin appears well tolerated and highly effective in Japanese patients treated in a real-world setting, including those who start treatment at age <4 years and pregnant women."

    "abstract": "Although past studies have documented motor control impairments in individuals with early-treated phenylketonuria (ETPKU), much less is known regarding motor learning in ETPKU. The goal of the present study was to advance our understanding on this front. We isolated and examined motor kinematics associated with the learning of a rapid aimed limb movement in a sample of 40 individuals (13-34 years of age) with ETPKU and a matched comparison group of 40 individuals without phenylketonuria (PKU). Indices of motor learning included overall movement duration as well as the relative proportion of movement time devoted to ballistic and corrective submovements. (Note that practice of motor movements in nonclinical populations is associated with, not only improvements in overall speed, but also reduction in the proportion of movement time devoted to corrective submovements relative to an initial ballistic submovement.) Results: A group-by-time interaction was found. With practice, the non-PKU group showed a significant reduction in the proportion of movement time devoted to the corrected (as compared to the ballistic) submovement. A similar change was not observed for the ETPKU group. In addition, within the ETPKU group, the rate of improvement in total movement duration was correlated with recent blood phenylalanine levels (an indicator of treatment adherence). Motor learning is adversely affected in individuals with ETPKU. Further investigation into the behavioral and neural mechanisms of motor learning in ETPKU will advance our understanding of the etiologic basis for this disruption as well as how it relates to the broader neurocognitive profile of ETPKU.

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a rare disease caused by biallelic mutations in the PAH gene that result in an inability to convert phenylalanine (Phe) to tyrosine, elevated blood Phe levels and severe neurological complications if untreated. Most patients are unable to adhere to the protein-restricted diet, and thus do not achieve target blood Phe levels. We engineered a strain of E. coli Nissle 1917, designated SYNB1618, through insertion of the genes encoding phenylalanine ammonia lyase and L-amino acid deaminase into the genome, which allow for bacterial consumption of Phe within the gastrointestinal tract. SYNB1618 was studied in a phase 1/2a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multi-centre, in-patient study ( NCT03516487 ) in adult healthy volunteers (n = 56) and patients with PKU and blood Phe level ≥600 mmol l<sup>-1</sup> (n = 14). Participants were randomized to receive a single dose of SYNB1618 or placebo (part 1) or up to three times per day for up to 7 days (part 2). The primary outcome of this study was safety and tolerability, and the secondary outcome was microbial kinetics. A D5-Phe tracer (15 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>) was used to study exploratory pharmacodynamic effects. SYNB1618 was safe and well tolerated with a maximum tolerated dose of 2 × 10<sup>11</sup> colony-forming units. Adverse events were mostly gastrointestinal and of mild to moderate severity. All participants cleared the bacteria within 4 days of the last dose. Dose-responsive increases in strain-specific Phe metabolites in plasma (trans-cinnamic acid) and urine (hippuric acid) were observed, providing a proof of mechanism for the potential to use engineered bacteria in the treatment of rare metabolic disorders."

We have previously described SYNB1618, an engineered bacterial therapeutic (synthetic biotic) for the treatment of Phenylketonuria (PKU), a rare genetic disease that leads to accumulation of plasma phenylalanine (Phe) and severe neurological complications. SYNB1618 consumes Phe in preclinical models, healthy human volunteers, and PKU patients. However, it remains unclear to what extent Phe consumption by SYNB1618 in the gastrointestinal tract lowers plasma Phe levels in PKU patients. Here, we construct a mechanistic model that predicts SYNB1618 function in non-human primates and healthy subjects by combining in vitro simulations and prior knowledge of human physiology. In addition, we extend a model of plasma Phe kinetics in PKU patients, in order to estimate plasma Phe lowering by SYNB1618. This approach provides a framework that can be used more broadly to define the therapeutic potential of synthetic biotics."

This is due to a lack of suitable parenteral nutrition or enteral formula. Our aim was to analyse tolerance to phenylalanine in these infants. There are approximately 110 000 children born in the Czech Republic each year. A neonatal screening programme from 2005 to 2020 found that 320 neonates had PKU, including 30 premature neonates with a birth weight of less than 2500 g. This study focused on three neonates who were born with ELBWs of 720, 740 and 950 g, respectively. Phenylalanine levels normalised in ELBW neonates with PKU within 1 week of the introduction of low-phenylalanine parenteral or enteral nutrition. The tolerance to phenylalanine was very high (70-110 mg/kg) in the first months of life, due to a rapid weight gain, but significantly decreased during infancy. Extremely low birthweight neonates with PKU need special dietary management. Regular assessments of phenylalanine are necessary during the first weeks of life to allow prompt dietary adjustments that reflect rapid weight gain and transitory high tolerance to phenylalanine."

It is estimated that 2% of children with PKU develop a severe and progressive neurological disease, called non-classic (malignant) PKU. This study aimed to demonstrate the clinical features, laboratory findings, and diagnostic/therapeutic characteristics of non-classic PKU patients referred to a tertiary referral center for children in Tehran, Iran. In this study, background information, such as gender and age, clinical manifestations, laboratory findings, and response rate to conventional treatment, was investigated in patients with non-classic PKU, who were referred to Mofid Children's Hospital in Tehran, Iran, through neonatal screening. Twenty patients with a diagnosis of non-classic PKU were included in this study. The mean age of the patients was 6.00±2.81 years (range: 2-12 years), and 45.0% were male. In patients with a late diagnosis, the most common presentations were motor developmental delay (15.0%), skin and cutaneous manifestations (15.0%), seizure (5.0%), and restlessness (5.0%). The overall response rate to treatment was 85.0%. Factors that predict good response to treatment included female gender, higher neopterin level, and lower age at diagnosis and management. In conclusion, about half of patients with non-classic PKU remain asymptomatic, which is due to early diagnosis via neonatal screening. Also, higher age at diagnosis and treatment, besides low neopterin levels, may be useful as prognostic factors."

Our goal was to develop core outcome sets (COSs) for these diseases to facilitate meaningful future evidence generation and enhance the capacity to compare and synthesize findings across studies. Parents and/or caregivers, health professionals, and health policy advisors completed a Delphi survey and participated in a consensus workshop to select core outcomes from candidate lists of outcomes for MCAD deficiency and PKU. Delphi participants rated the importance of outcomes on a nine-point scale (1-3: not important, 4-6: important but not critical, 7-9: critical). Candidate outcomes were progressively narrowed down over 3 survey rounds. At the workshop, participants evaluated the remaining candidate outcomes using an adapted nominal technique, open discussion, and voting. After the workshop, we finalized the COSs and recommended measurement instruments for each outcome. There were 85, 61, and 53 participants across 3 Delphi rounds, respectively. The candidate core outcome lists were narrowed down to 20 outcomes per disease to be discussed at the consensus workshop. Voting by 18 workshop participants led to COSs composed of 8 and 9 outcomes for MCAD deficiency and PKU, respectively, with measurement recommendations. These are the first known pediatric COSs for MCAD deficiency and PKU. Adoption in future studies will help to ensure best use of limited research resources to ultimately improve care for children with these rare diseases."

However, the factors impacting the selective adsorption of phenylalanine and peptides to activated carbon is not fully understood, which is holding back the optimization of this process. In this research, two activated carbons with different morphologies and electrical characteristics were used to adsorb egg white hydrolysates with different degrees of hydrolysis. The selective adsorption behavior of the different constituents within the hydrolysates was studied to identify the nature of the adsorption mechanisms involved. The results showed that aromatic amino acids and components with higher molecular weight were preferentially adsorbed. Moreover, the main driving force for adsorption was hydrophobic attraction, followed by hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions. These results could facilitate the preparation of medical foods for patients with phenylketonuria."

Clinical exome sequencing data of 4503 disease-associated genes obtained from a cohort of 985 Vietnamese individuals was analyzed to identify pathogenic variants, associated diseases and their carrier frequencies in the population. A total of 118 recessive diseases associated with 164 pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were identified, among which 28 diseases had carrier frequencies of at least 1% (1 in 100 individuals). Three diseases were prevalent in the Vietnamese population with carrier frequencies of 2-12 times higher than in the world populations, including beta-thalassemia (1 in 23), citrin deficiency (1 in 31), and phenylketonuria (1 in 40). Seven novel pathogenic and two likely pathogenic variants associated with nine recessive diseases were discovered. The comprehensive profile of recessive diseases identified in this study enables the design of cost-effective carrier screening programs specific to the Vietnamese population."

We performed a retrospective case series analysis involving 11 adult classical phenylketonuria/hyperphenylalaninemia patients under the care of an Inherited Metabolic & Neuropsychiatry Clinic who had complained of memory problems, collating casenote data from blood biochemistry, and clinical [<sup>18</sup>F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ([<sup>18</sup>F]FDG PET). The Phe:Tyr ratio was calculated for individual blood samples and summarized as historical mean Phe:Tyr ratio (Phe:Tyr) and historical standard deviation in Phe:Tyr ratio (SD-Phe:Tyr), for each patient. Visual analyses of [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG PET revealed heterogeneous patterns of glucose hypometabolism for eight patients. [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG PET standardized uptake was negatively correlated with Phe in a large cluster with peak localized to right superior parietal gyrus. Even larger clusters of negative correlation that encompassed most of the brain, with frontal peaks, were observed with Phe:Tyr, and SD-Phe:Tyr. Our case series analysis provides further evidence for the association between blood biomarkers, and cerebral glucose hypometabolism. Mean historical blood Phe:Tyr ratio, and its standard deviation over time, appear to be more indicative of global cerebral glucose metabolism in patients with memory problems than Phe."

In the present study, we investigated whether Phe and its derivatives PAA, PLA and PPA separately or in combination could induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation and provoke DNA damage in C6 glial cells. We also tested the role of L-carnitine (L-car), which has been recently considered an antioxidant agent and easily cross the blood brain barrier on the alterations of C6 redox status provoked by Phe and its metabolites. We first observed that cell viability was not changed by Phe and its metabolites. Furthermore, Phe, PAA, PLA and PPA, at concentrations found in plasma of PKU patients, provoked marked DNA damage in the glial cells separately and when combined. Of note, these effects were totally prevented (Phe, PAA and PPA) or attenuated (PLA) by L-car pre-treatment. In addition, a potent ROS formation also induced by Phe and PAA, whereas only moderate increases of ROS were caused by PPA and PLA. Pre-treatment with L-car also prevented Phe- and PAA-induced ROS generation, but not that provoked by PLA and PPA. Thus, our data show that Phe and its major metabolites accumulated in PKU provoke extensive DNA damage in glial cells probably by ROS formation and that L-car may potentially represent an adjuvant therapeutic agent in PKU treatment."

    "abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate the biochemical factors, genetic mutations, outcome of treatment, and clinical follow-up data of Iranian patients with tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) deficiency from April/2016 to March/2020. Forty-seven BH4 deficiency patients were included in the study and underwent biochemical and genetic analyses. The clinical outcomes of the patients were evaluated after long-term treatment. Out of the 47 (25 females and 22 males) BH4 deficiency patients enrolled in the study, 23 were Dihydropteridine reductase (DHPR) deficient patients, 23 were 6-pyruvoyl-tetrahydropterin synthase (PTPS) deficient patients, and one was GTP-Cyclohydrolase 1 deficiency (GTPCH-1) patient. No clinical symptoms were observed in 10 of the DHPR deficient patients (before and after the treatment). Also, most patients diagnosed at an early age had a proper response to the treatment. However, drug therapy did not improve clinical symptoms in three of the patients diagnosed at the age of over 10 years. Also, 16 PTPS deficiency patients who were detected within 6 months and received treatment no clinical symptoms were presented. One of the patients was detected with GTPCH deficiency. Despite being treated with BH4, this patient suffered from a seizure, movement disorder, mental retardation, speech difficulty, and hypotonia. The study results showed that neonatal screening should be carried out in all patients with hyperphenylalaninemia because early diagnosis and treatment can reduce symptoms and prevent neurological impairments. Although the BH4 deficiency outcomes are highly variable, early diagnosis and treatment in the first months of life are crucial for good outcomes."

    "abstract": "Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is an inherited disorder caused by the absence or severely impaired activity of steroidogenic enzymes involved in cortisol biosynthesis. More than 90% of cases result from 21-hydroxylase deficiency (21OHD). To prevent life-threatening adrenal crisis and to help perform appropriate sex assignments for affected female patients, newborn screening (NBS) programs for the classical form of CAH have been introduced in numerous countries. In Japan, the NBS for CAH was introduced in 1989, following the screenings for phenylketonuria and congenital hypothyroidism. In this review, we aim to summarize the experience of the past 30 years of the NBS for CAH in Japan, composed of four parts, 1: screening system in Japan, 2: the clinical outcomes for the patients with CAH, 3: various factors that would impact the NBS system, including timeline, false positive, and LC-MS/MS, 4: Database composition and improvement of the screening program."

    "abstract": "Human phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) is a metabolic enzyme involved in the catabolism of L-Phe in liver. Loss of conformational stability and decreased enzymatic activity in PAH variants result in the autosomal recessive disorder phenylketonuria (PKU), characterized by developmental and psychological problems if not treated early. One current therapeutic approach to treat PKU is based on pharmacological chaperones (PCs), small molecules that can displace the folding equilibrium of unstable PAH variants toward the native state, thereby rescuing the physiological function of the enzyme. Understanding the PAH folding equilibrium is essential to develop new PCs for different forms of the disease. We investigate here the urea and the thermal-induced denaturation of full-length PAH and of a truncated form lacking the regulatory and the tetramerization domains. For either protein construction, two distinct transitions are seen in chemical denaturation followed by fluorescence emission, indicating the accumulation of equilibrium unfolding intermediates where the catalytic domains are partly unfolded and dissociated from each other. According to analytical centrifugation, the chemical denaturation intermediates of either construction are not well-defined species but highly polydisperse ensembles of protein aggregates. On the other hand, each protein construction similarly shows two transitions in thermal denaturation measured by fluorescence or differential scanning calorimetry, also indicating the accumulation of equilibrium unfolding intermediates. The similar temperatures of mid denaturation of the two constructions, together with their apparent lack of response to protein concentration, indicate the catalytic domains are unfolded in the full-length PAH thermal intermediate, where they remain associated. That the catalytic domain unfolds in the first thermal transition is relevant for the choice of PCs identified in high throughput screening of chemical libraries using differential scanning fluorimetry."

    "abstract": "The present study assessed patients' metabolic control of phenylketonuria (PKU) during the first 2020 COVID-19 lockdown in Poland. Blood (phenylalanine) Phe results of the tests of 535 patients, performed in 2019 and in the first months of 2020, were analysed. The six-week lockdown period was compared to the preceding six-week period as well as to the two corresponding periods of 2019 (three non-lockdown periods). More patients failed to perform Phe tests in the lockdown period (32.7%) than in non-lockdown periods (15.6%, 15.1%, 17.2%; <i>p</i> < 0.001 for all). The median Phe levels for those patients who performed testing in all the four periods did not differ between periods. However, these patients tended to perform only one test during the lockdown (ORs: 1.43 to 1.60; 95% CI: from 1.01-2.04 to 1.11-2.30, <i>p</i>-value 0.02 to 0.005). Patients who did not take blood during the lockdown (46.7%) performed significantly fewer blood tests in the remaining periods (median <IQR>: 1 <0-1> vs. 2 <1-4>; <i>p</i> < 0.001). In conclusion, direct assessment of patients' compliance based upon Phe levels during the pandemic lockdown was not possible. Pre-pandemic non-compliant patients frequently failed to perform the test during the lockdown, whereas the previously compliant ones were more likely to perform only one test. This strongly suggests that metabolic control might have worsened."

To study longitudinal bone density, mass, and geometry over 36 months in children with PKU taking either amino acid (L-AA) or casein glycomacropeptide substitutes (CGMP-AA) as their main protein source. A total of 48 subjects completed the study, 19 subjects in the L-AA group (median age 11.1, range 5-16 years) and 29 subjects in the CGMP-AA group (median age 8.3, range 5-16 years). The CGMP-AA was further divided into two groups, CGMP100 (median age 9.2, range 5-16 years) (<i>n</i> = 13), children taking CGMP-AA only and CGMP50 (median age 7.3, range 5-15 years) (<i>n</i> = 16), children taking a combination of CGMP-AA and L-AA. Dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) was measured at enrolment and 36 months, peripheral quantitative computer tomography (pQCT) at 36 months only, and serum blood and urine bone turnover markers (BTM) and blood bone biochemistry at enrolment, 6, 12, and 36 months. No statistically significant differences were found between the three groups for DXA outcome parameters, i.e., BMDa (L2-L4 BMDa g/cm<sup>2</sup>), bone mineral apparent density (L2-L4 BMAD g/cm<sup>3</sup>) and total body less head BMDa (TBLH g/cm<sup>2</sup>). All blood biochemistry markers were within the reference ranges, and BTM showed active bone turnover with a trend for BTM to decrease with increasing age. Bone density was clinically normal, although the median z scores were below the population mean. BTM showed active bone turnover and blood biochemistry was within the reference ranges. There appeared to be no advantage to bone density, mass, or geometry from taking a macropeptide-based protein substitute as compared with L-AAs."

    "abstract": "Aspartame is a sweetener introduced to replace the commonly used sucrose. It was discovered by James M. Schlatter in 1965. Being 180-200 times sweeter than sucrose, its intake was expected to reduce obesity rates in developing countries and help those struggling with diabetes. It is mainly used as a sweetener for soft drinks, confectionery, and medicines. Despite its widespread use, its safety remains controversial. This narrative review investigates the existing literature on the use of aspartame and its possible effects on the human body to refine current knowledge. Taking to account that aspartame is a widely used artificial sweetener, it seems appropriate to continue research on safety. Studies mentioned in this article have produced very interesting results overall, the current review highlights the social problem of providing visible and detailed information about the presence of aspartame in products. The studies involving the impact of aspartame on obesity, diabetes mellitus, children and fetus, autism, neurodegeneration, phenylketonuria, allergies and skin problems, its cancer properties and its genotoxicity were analyzed. Further research should be conducted to ensure clear information about the impact of aspartame on health."

    "abstract": "There is agreement that the pandemic has affected the healthcare system and behaviour of patients. This study aims to identify problems encountered by patients with phenylketonuria (PKU) and their parents/caregivers during the six-week pandemic lockdown in Poland (15 March to 30 April 2020). To determine the factors that influenced health and treatment-related issues, as well as the respondents' perception of the impact of the pandemic, study participants were asked to complete a non-validated online questionnaire comprising 31 questions (including 27 single-choice, two multiple-choice and two open-ended ones). A total of 571 patients or their parents completed the questionnaire, with 9.5% of respondents not performing any blood phenylalanine (Phe) test in the analysed period, 21.3% declaring a blood Phe increase, and 15.3% a decrease. Increased problems in contacting the doctor or dietitian were reported by 26.1% of subjects, whereas 39.3% of them felt restricted access to dietary products. Most (63.4%) participants were satisfied with remote contact with their PKU clinic. Better compliance was associated with higher odds of acceptance of remote contact and of reporting fewer problems with contacting the doctor, and with lower odds of missing Phe testing. Self-reported high stress was associated with higher odds of reporting the limited availability of low-Phe products and Phe-free formulas, as well as with increased Phe concentrations and non-PKU-related health problems. These patients also had poor dietary compliance and experienced more problems in contacting specialists. Health and treatment-related problems experienced during the pandemic lockdown were related to a higher intensity of stress in patient's family and worse therapy compliance before the pandemic. Previous experience of remote visits resulted in a better perception of this method of contact. It seems that this form of communication should be popularized and improved to increase therapy effectiveness in case of different limitations in the future. Special attention should be paid to vulnerable patients who may be at extra risk when the provision of standard care is affected."

    "abstract": "Over the last 50 years, routine newborn blood screening for congenital disorders has been hailed as a miracle of modern science, saving countless lives by providing a means to detect and treat life-threatening disorders before symptoms present. Despite progress made with more than 5,000 babies effectively identified with rare conditions each year, congenital anomalies collectively remain at the top of the list as the cause of death for babies under 1 year of age, accounting for more than 20% of all infant mortalities. Rapid technological advances have seen the original singular newborn screen for phenylketonuria expand to a core set of 34 conditions and an additional 26 secondary conditions on the Recommended Uniform Screening Panel, with wide state-to-state variation for implementation. As genomic analysis evolves to enable next-generation sequencing, debates continue over the ethical, legal, and social implications of identifying conditions for which there is no effective treatment. Nurse practitioners should be engaged and informed in providing evidence-based support to families engaging in ethical complex decision making surrounding newborn screening while effectively balancing risk-benefit analysis with individual beliefs and values."

This is the case for hundreds of monogenic metabolic disorders of hepatic origin, for which liver transplantation remains the only cure. Furthermore, the liver contains 10-15% of the body's total blood volume, making it ideal for use as a factory to secrete proteins into the circulation. In recent decades, an expanding toolbox has become available for liver-directed gene delivery. Although viral vectors have long been the preferred approach to target hepatocytes, an increasing number of non-viral vectors are emerging as highly efficient vehicles for the delivery of genetic material. Herein, we review advances in gene delivery vectors targeting the liver and more specifically hepatocytes, covering strategies based on gene addition and gene editing, as well as the exciting results obtained with the use of RNA as a therapeutic molecule. Moreover, we will briefly summarise some of the limitations of current liver-directed gene therapy approaches and potential ways of overcoming them."

The Pdot is combined with a metabolite-specific NAD(P)H-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of the metabolite, generating NAD(P)H. Upon UV illumination, the NAD(P)H quenches the fluorescence emission of Pdot at 627 nm via electron transfer, and also fluoresces at 458 nm, resulting in a shift from red to blue emission at higher NAD(P)H concentrations. Metabolite concentration is quantified ratiometrically-based on the ratio of blue-to-red channel emission intensities, with a digital camera-with high sensitivity and specificity. We demonstrate phenylalanine biosensing in human plasma for a phenylketonuria screening test, quantifying several other disease-related metabolites (lactate, glucose, glutamate, and β-hydroxybutyrate), and a paper-based assay with smartphore imaging for point-of-care use."

    "abstract": "Previous studies have suggested that cognitive and psychosocial underfunctioning in early-treated adults with phenylketonuria (PKU) may be explained by suboptimal adherence to dietary treatments, however, these studies often employ small samples, with different outcome measures, definitions and cut-offs. Samples have also tended to comprise participants with a limited range of blood phenylalanine concentrations, and often individuals who may not have been treated early enough to avoid neurological damage. In this study, we explore the impact of lifetime dietary control, as indicated by blood phenylalanine concentrations in childhood, adolescence and adulthood, on long-term cognitive and psychosocial outcomes in a large sample of adults with PKU who were diagnosed by neonatal screening and commenced on dietary treatment within the first month of life. One hundred and fifty-four participants underwent cognitive testing, assessing attention, learning, working memory, language, executive functioning and processing speed. One hundred and forty-nine completed measures of psychosocial functioning, documenting educational, occupational, quality of life, emotional and social outcomes which were compared with a group of healthy controls. Many adults with PKU demonstrated cognitive impairments, most frequently affecting processing speed (23%), executive function (20%) and learning (12%). Cognitive outcomes were related to measures of historic metabolic control, but only processing speed was significantly related to phenylalanine concentration at the time of testing after controlling for historic levels. Adults with PKU did not, however, differ from controls in educational, occupational, quality of life or emotional outcomes, or on a measure of family functioning, and showed only minor differences in relationship style. These findings have implications for patient counselling and decisions regarding the management of PKU in adulthood."

In this cross-sectional study anthropometric measurements, serum phenylalanine levels, and 10 metabolites associated with lipid and carbohydrate metabolism were analyzed in 101 adolescents aged 10-20 years. Adolescents were categorized into overweight/obesity and eutrophic/low body mass index groups. These patients were compared using Student's t-test, Pearson's chi-square test, Wald's chi-square test for multivariate analysis. Further, to verify whether the prevalence of overweight/obesity found in the study population was similar to that in the general population, the authors compared the nutritional status of 46 patients aged 13-17 years with that of healthy students of the same age from the National School Health Survey using the chi-square test for adherence. The significance threshold was p < 0.5. The prevalence of overweight/obesity in adolescents was 27.7%. There was no difference in prevalence between sexes. Older age was a protective factor and Increased Homeostasis Model Assessment Insulin Resistance index and high phenylalanine and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were predictive factors for overweight/obesity. The equality hypothesis was not rejected in the comparison of nutritional states of 46 patients aged 13-17 years and healthy students of the same age.

A literature search in all languages was carried out with the terms of hearing screening from the following sources: Pub Med, Science Direct, World Catalog, Index Medicus, Google scholar, Google Books, National Library of Medicine, Welcome historical library and The Library of Congress. The primary sources consisting of books, scientific reports, public documents, governmental reports, and other written material were analyzed to document the history of hearing screening. The concept of screening for medical conditions that, when found, could influence some form of the outcome of the malady came about during the end of 19th century. The first applications of screening were to circumscribe populations, schoolchildren, military personnel, and railroad employees. During the first half of the 20th century, screening programs were extended to similar populations and were able to be expanded on the basis of the improved technology of hearing testing. The concept of universal screening was first applied to the inborn errors of metabolism of newborn infants and particularly the assessment of phenylketonuria in 1963 by Guthrie and Susi. A limited use of this technique has been the detection of genes resulting in hearing loss. The use of a form of hearing testing either observational or physiological as a screen for all newborns was first articulated by Larry Fisch in 1957 and by the end of the 20th century newborn infant screening for hearing loss became the standard almost every nation worldwide. Hearing screening for newborn infants is utilized worldwide, schoolchildren less so and for adults many industrial workers and military service undergo hearing screening, but this is not a general practice for screening the elderly.

Early expansion of the included disorders was slow because each additional disorder screened required a separate test. Subsequently, the technological advancements of biochemical methodology enabled the scaling-up of newborn screening, most notably with the implementation of tandem mass spectrometry. In recent years, we have witnessed a remarkable progression of high-throughput sequencing technologies, which has resulted in a continuous decrease of both cost and time required for genetic analysis. This has enabled more widespread use of the massive multiparallel sequencing. Genomic sequencing is now frequently used in clinical applications, and its implementation in newborn screening has been intensively advocated. The expansion of newborn screening has raised many clinical, ethical, legal, psychological, sociological, and technological concerns over time.

A cross-sectional study evaluating nutritional intake (3-day food record and food frequency questionnaire), anthropometrics, laboratory indices of protein, micronutrient, and essential fatty acid (EFA) status, and questionnaires evaluating food neophobia and Epicurean eating pleasure. Participants (n = 18, 61% female) started pegvaliase 4.9 ± 2.1 years prior to enrollment and were aged 38.2 ± 8.8 years with a mean BMI of 29.2 ± 4.1 kg/m<sup>2</sup>.

Micronutrient and EFA concentrations were normal except for mildly low vitamin D (<30 ng/mL, n = 12). Intakes of sodium, saturated fat, and added sugars exceeded recommendations for healthy adults, though mean diet quality was comparable to a US adult reference population. Lower food neophobia scores correlated with an increased aesthetic appreciation of food. However, 53% of participants self-reported having moderate (n = 6) to high (n = 3) food neophobia. Participants treated with pegvaliase consumed an unrestricted diet with adequate dietary protein and, overall, had normal protein, micronutrient, and fatty acid status. Despite low blood Phe, protein nutriture was not compromised. While nutritional deficiencies were not identified, diet quality was suboptimal and some participants reported food neophobia.

However, reaching the therapeutic threshold with genome-integrating vectors is challenging. Therefore, we developed a method to expand hepatocytes bearing therapeutic transgenes. The common fever medicine acetaminophen becomes hepatotoxic via cytochrome p450 metabolism. Lentiviral vectors with transgenes linked in cis to a <i>Cypor</i> shRNA were administered to neonatal mice. Hepatocytes lacking the essential cofactor of Cyp enzymes, NADPH-cytochrome p450 reductase (Cypor), were selected in vivo by acetaminophen administration, replacing up to 50% of the hepatic mass. Acetaminophen treatment of the mice resulted in over 30-fold expansion of transgene-bearing hepatocytes and achieved therapeutic thresholds in hemophilia B and phenylketonuria. We conclude that therapeutically modified hepatocytes can be selected safely and efficiently in preclinical models with a transient regimen of moderately hepatotoxic acetaminophen."

The mean native thiol / total thiol ratio of the patient group was significantly lower when compared to the control group (92.0±3.3 vs 94.1±2.7, p=0.001).

Poor metabolic control and non-compliance to treatment was found to be associated with increased oxidative stress. Oxidative stress parameters were found to be correlated with metabolic chemicals such as ammonia, leucine, and citrulline. There was no correlation between phenylalanine and lactate levels and oxidative stress parameters.

The consensus group consisted of 10 PKU experts: six dietitians and one paediatrician from Europe and three dietitians from the US. One European and three US dietitians had experience with pegvaliase-treated patients. The consensus group recommended that a physician, dietitian and nurse are part of the pegvaliase treatment team. Additionally, a psychologist/counsellor should be included if available. Practical proposals for the nutritional evaluation of pegvaliase-treated patients at baseline, during the induction and titration phases and for long-term maintenance were developed. The consensus group suggested assessment of blood Phe at least monthly or every 2 weeks in the event of low blood Phe (i.e., blood Phe <30 μmol/L). It may be appropriate to increase blood Phe monitoring when adjusting protein intake and/or pegvaliase dose. It was recommended that natural protein intake is increased by 10-20 g increments if blood Phe concentrations decrease to <240 μmol/L in patients who are not meeting the dietary reference intake for natural protein of 0.8 g/kg. It was proposed that with pegvaliase treatment blood Phe levels could be maintained <240 μmol/L but more evidence on the safety of achieving physiological blood Phe levels is necessary before any recommendation on the lower blood Phe target can be given. Finally, both patients and dietitians should have access to educational resources to optimally support patients receiving pegvaliase. This practical road map aims to provide initial recommendations for dietitians monitoring patients with PKU prescribed pegvaliase. Given that practical experience with pegvaliase is still limited, nutritional recommendations will require regular updating once more evidence is available and clinical experience evolves."

    "title": "Screening of Congenital Hypothyroidism in North-East Romania. Benefits and Messages for Further Improvement.",
    "abstract": "If not diagnosed at birth, congenital hypothyroidism (CH) can cause deleterious, irreversible neurodevelopmental sequels. The importance of thyroid newborn screening (NBS) is therefore well established. To evaluate the efficacy of NBS for CH in North-East Romania. Retrospective, descriptive study involving 271662 newborns screened between 2010 and 2019 for CH and phenylketonuria in maternities from six Romanian North-Eastern counties by measuring neonatal TSH (neoTSH) in the whole blood extracted from the heel between days 3 and 5 after birth. Values found higher than a cut-off level of 10 mIU/L were followed by serum evaluation of TSH and fT4 for the confirmation of CH. Thyroid ultrasound was further performed at children found with CH. NeoTSH was found elevated in 417 newborns, but CH was subsequently confirmed in only 57 cases (1/4766 newborns). Mean age at the time when diagnosis was communicated was of 37.2 ± 15 days (between 9 and 157 days). Mean age when therapy was started was of 44.2 ± 17.9 days (between 13 and 160 days) with a mean delay of one week from diagnosis (between 0 and 62 days). Thyroid ultrasound revealed athyreosis in only 3 cases, atrophic thyroid gland in other 10 cases, whereas the thyroid was described as present in the remnant 44 cases. The number of first year follow-up visits greatly varied from 0 to 5, with an average of 2. NBS allowed rapid diagnosis of CH in North East Romania. The communication of diagnosis to families and therapy onset were however often delayed. Diagnosis and therapy onset before the age of two weeks, as well as a tighter follow-up should be assured by the healthcare system. Etiological diagnosis should be more accurate, for a better prognosis of disease severity, as well as the possibility of genetic advice in selected cases."

    "abstract": "High rates of lost to follow-up (LTFU) adult patients are a major concern in the long-term management of phenylketonuria (PKU). To address this issue, we designed the project \"Backtoclinic\" with the purpose of identifying LTFU adult PKU patients in Austria as a first step to reestablish appropriate treatment. Individuals born between 1966 and 1999 and diagnosed with PKU through the National Austrian Newborn Screening Program (NANSP) were identified using the NANSP's database. Follow-up data were collected in the Austrian metabolic centers (Medical University of Vienna, Graz, Innsbruck and Salzburg). Patients with no contact to any of these centers within the previous two years were classified as LTFU. Epidemiological characteristics of the whole study population as well as of LTFU- and currently in follow-up patients were analyzed. Between 1966 and 1999, 281 individuals were diagnosed with PKU through the NANSP. Two patients died in their first year of life and were excluded from the analysis. Of the remaining 279 patients (mean age ± SD: 36.7 ± 9.1 y, 42.7% females), 177 (63.4%) are currently LTFU. The rate of LTFU patients is higher in men than in women (68.1% vs 57.5%), and markedly increases with age in both sexes. The gender gap is greatest in young adults (52.6% vs. 25.0% in the age range 20.0-24.9 y) and declines with age (94.4% vs. 80.0% in the age range > 45.0 y). We found an alarming rate of 63.4% of LTFU adult PKU patients in Austria, and observed a gender gap in the PKU state of care. Our findings illustrate the urgent need for the metabolic community to identify LTFU adult PKU patients and to develop strategies to reestablish appropriate treatment for men and women with PKU."

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a common disease associated with amino acid metabolism, and usually occurs in newborns. It can cause serious neurological diseases and even death. However, owing to inadequate-effective treatment, it can only be slowed by a low-phenylalanine (Phe) diet. In addition, PKU screening is essential for newborns in many countries. Therefore, rapid screening is crucial for preventing damage and meeting the large sample diagnosis demand. For confirmed patients, a convenient method to monitor their regular Phe levels is required. However, current clinical methods do not meet the rapid screening and convenient monitoring requirements. Herein, a rapid and facile electrochemical device based on platinum-doped reduced graphene oxide nanocomposites was developed to detect PKU biomarker-Phe. The results demonstrated that the developed electrode has great sensitivity, selectivity, and stability. The detection range was 0.0001 mM to 6 mM with a limit of detection of 0.01 μM. Therefore, this work offers a simple and rapid method for point-of-care PKU screening and daily monitoring."

    "abstract": "Phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder that results in elevated concentrations of phenylalanine (Phe) in the blood. If left untreated, the accumulation of Phe can result in profound neurocognitive disability. The objective of this systematic literature review and meta-analysis was to estimate the global birth prevalence of PAH deficiency from newborn screening studies and to estimate regional differences, overall and for various clinically relevant Phe cutoff values used in confirmatory testing. The protocol for this literature review was registered with PROSPERO (International prospective register of systematic reviews). Pubmed and Embase database searches were used to identify studies that reported the birth prevalence of PAH deficiency. Only studies including numeric birth prevalence reports of confirmed PAH deficiency were included. From the 85 publications included in the review, 238 birth prevalence estimates were extracted. After excluding prevalence estimates that did not meet quality assessment criteria or because of temporal and regional overlap, estimates from 45 publications were included in the meta-analysis. The global birth prevalence of PAH deficiency, estimated by weighting regional birth prevalences relative to their share of the population of all regions included in the study, was 0.64 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.53-0.75) per 10,000 births and ranged from 0.03 (95% CI 0.02-0.05) per 10,000 births in Southeast Asia to 1.18 (95% CI 0.64-1.87) per 10,000 births in the Middle East/North Africa. Regionally weighted global birth prevalences per 10,000 births by confirmatory test Phe cutoff values were 0.96 (95% CI 0.50-1.42) for the Phe cutoff value of 360 ± 100 µmol/L; 0.50 (95% CI 0.37-0.64) for the Phe cutoff value of 600 ± 100 µmol/L; and 0.30 (95% CI 0.20-0.40) for the Phe cutoff value of 1200 ± 200 µmol/L. Substantial regional variation in the birth prevalence of PAH deficiency was observed in this systematic literature review and meta-analysis of published evidence from newborn screening. The precision of the prevalence estimates is limited by relatively small sample sizes, despite widespread and longstanding newborn screening in much of the world."

Pegvaliase is administered via subcutaneous injection and carries a high risk of side effects including anaphylaxis. A consensus statement on its use recommends careful education and monitoring of patients. We established a dedicated Palynziq Clinic in October 2018 with detailed protocols to minimize these risks. In the first year, we evaluated 43 patients, initiated Palynziq in 37 and transitioned two trial patients to commercial drug. 13/37 patients (35.1%) have sustained blood phenylalanine levels <360 μmol/L (6 mg/dL) without adjunct sapropterin dihydrochloride treatment or medical food. The timing and dosage needed to achieve a response did not correlate with patient weight, starting phenylalanine level, starting diet, or co-treatment with sapropterin dihydrochloride. Some patients had consistently low phenylalanine levels <30 μmol/L (0.5 mg/dL) and required doses as low as 20 mg weekly. Anaphylactic episodes were reported by 21.6% (8/37 patients) versus 10% seen in the clinical trial. Rates of other side effects were similar to or less than those in the trial. Adverse reactions commonly occurred shortly after dosage increases. We provide a model for safely introducing and managing pegvaliase in adult patients with PKU."

    "abstract": "Creatine (Cr) levels are strongly dependent on diets, including animal-derived proteins. Cr is an important metabolite as it represents a source of stored energy to support physical performance and potentially sustain positive effects such as improving memory or intelligence. This study was planned to assess Cr levels in PKU children adhering to a diet low in phenylalanine (Phe) content and compared with those of children with mild hyperphenylalaninemia (MHP) on a free diet. This retrospective pilot study analyzed Cr levels from Guthrie cards in 25 PKU and 35 MHP subjects. Anthropomorphic and nutritional data of the study populations were assessed, compared and correlated. Cr levels of PKU subjects were significantly lower than those of MHP subjects and correlated to the low intake of animal proteins. Although no deficiencies in PKU subjects were identified, PKU subjects were found to have a 26-fold higher risk of displaying Cr levels <25° percentile than MHP counterparts. This pilot study suggests that Cr levels might be concerningly low in PKU children adhering to a low-Phe diet. Confirmatory studies are needed in PKU patients of different age groups to assess Cr levels and the potential benefits on physical and intellectual performance of Cr supplementation."

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of newborn screening and treatment for phenylketonuria (PKU) in the context of new data on adherence to recommended diet treatment and a newly available drug treatment (sapropterin dihydrochloride). A computer simulation model was developed to project outcomes for a hypothetical cohort of newborns with PKU. Four strategies were compared: (1) clinical identification (CI) with diet treatment; (2) newborn screening (NBS) with diet treatment; (3) CI with diet and medication (sapropterin dihydrochloride); and (4) NBS with diet and medication. Data sources included published literature, primary data, and expert opinion. From a societal perspective, newborn screening with diet treatment had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $6400/QALY compared to clinical identification with diet treatment. Adding medication to NBS with diet treatment resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of more than $16,000,000/QALY. Uncertainty analyses did not substantially alter the cost-effectiveness results. Newborn screening for PKU with diet treatment yields a cost-effectiveness ratio lower than many other recommended childhood prevention programs even if adherence is lower than previously assumed. Adding medication yields cost-effectiveness results unlikely to be considered favorable. Future research should consider conditions under which sapropterin dihydrochloride would be more economically attractive."

Pegvaliase (recombinant Anabaena variabilis phenylalanine ammonia lyase conjugated with polyethylene glycol) is approved to manage PKU in patients aged greater than or equal to 18 years in the United States and in patients aged greater than or equal to 16 years in the European Union. Pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and immunogenicity results from five open-label pegvaliase trials were assessed. Studies with induction/titration/maintenance (I/T/M) dosing regimens demonstrated pharmacokinetic stabilization and sustained efficacy associated with maintenance doses (20, 40, or 60 mg/day). Immune-mediated pegvaliase clearance was high during induction/titration phases when the early immune response was peaking. The combination of low drug dosage and high drug clearance led to low drug exposure and minimal decreases in blood Phe levels during induction/titration. Higher drug exposure and substantial reductions in blood Phe levels were observed later in treatment as drug clearance was reduced due to the maturation of the immune response, which allowed for increased dosing to target levels. The incidence of hypersensitivity reactions was temporally associated with the peaking of the early antidrug immune response and decreased with time as immune response matured after the first 6 months of treatment. These results support an I/T/M dosing regimen and suggest a strategy for administration of other nonhuman biologics to achieve efficacy and improve tolerability."

Healthcare costs and resource-utilization were analyzed for the year 2015. Differences between groups were tested using 95% CI of mean differences (MD). PKU patients had significantly higher mean costs in total (MD €3307, 95% CI €1736-€4879), for pharmaceuticals (MD €1912, 95% CI €1195-€2629) [including dietary amino-acid supplements (MD €1268, 95% CI €864-€1672)], and outpatient costs (MD €395, 95% CI €115-€675). Inpatient costs (MD €904, 95% CI -€293 to €2100) and costs for aids and remedies (MD €97, 95% CI -€10 to €203) were also higher in PKU patients. PKU patients had more outpatient visits and stayed longer in hospital. Adult PKU patients incur higher total healthcare costs than non-PKU controls, especially regarding pharmaceuticals and outpatient costs, and more frequent resource-utilization, resulting in higher health-economic burden for the statutory healthcare system."

    "abstract": "Significant part of Southeastern Europe (with a population of 76 million) has newborn screening (NBS) programs non-harmonized with developed European countries. Initial survey was conducted in 2013/2014 among 11 countries from the region (Albania, Bulgaria, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BIH), Croatia, Kosovo, Macedonia, Moldova, Montenegro, Romania, Serbia, and Slovenia) to assess the main characteristics of their NBS programs and their future plans. Their cumulative population at that time was ~52,5 million. At that time, none of the countries had an expanded NBS program, while phenylketonuria screening was not introduced in four and congenital hypothyroidism in three of 11 countries. We repeated the survey in 2020 inviting the same 11 countries, adding Cyprus, Greece, Hungary, and Malta (due to their geographical position in the wider region). The aims were to assess the current state, to evaluate the change in the period, and to identify the main obstacles impacting the implementation of expanded NBS and/or reaching a wider population. Responses were collected from 12 countries (BIH-Federation of BIH, BIH-Republic of Srpska, Bulgaria, Croatia, Greece, Hungary, Kosovo, North Macedonia, Malta, Montenegro, Romania, Serbia, Slovenia) with a population of 68.5 million. The results of the survey showed that the regional situation regarding NBS only modestly improved in this period. All of the surveyed countries except Kosovo screened for at least congenital hypothyroidism, while phenylketonuria was not screened in four of 12 countries. Croatia and Slovenia implemented an expanded NBS program using tandem mass spectrometry from the time of last survey. In conclusion, the current status of NBS programs in Southeastern Europe is very variable and is still underdeveloped (or even non-existent) in some of the countries. We suggest establishing an international task-force to assist with implementation and harmonization of basic NBS services where needed."

To evaluate potential changes, we aimed to examine retinas of PKU patients using optical coherence tomography (OCT) with additional OCT angiography (OCTA) and compare the results to healthy controls. A total of 100 adults were recruited in this monocentric, case-control study: 50 patients with ETPKU (mean age: 30.66 ± 8.00 years) and 50 healthy controls (mean age: 30.45 ± 7.18 years). Macular thickness, vessel density and flow area of the right eye was assessed with spectral domain OCT angiography SD-OCT(A). Macular microstructural data between the ETPKU and control group was compared. In the ETPKU group, the relationship between visual functional parameters (best corrected visual acuity [VA], spherical equivalent [SE], contrast sensitivity [CS] and near stereoacuity) and microstructural alterations was examined. The dependency of OCT(A) values on serum phenylalanine (Phe) level was analysed. There was significant average parafoveal and perifoveal total retinal layer thinning in ETPKU patients compared to healthy controls (<i>p</i> < 0.016 and <i>p</i> < 0.001, respectively), while the foveal region remained unchanged in the ETPKU group. Whole macular and parafoveal superficial capillary plexus density was significantly decreased in ETPKU compared to controls (<i>p</i> < 0.001). There were no significant differences in the foveal avascular zone, nonflow area, macular superficial and deep capillary plexus between the groups. The temporal parafoveal inner retinal layer thickness was found to negatively correlate with individual Phe levels (<i>r</i> = -0.35, <i>p</i> = 0.042). There was no difference in vascular density and retinal thickness in the subgroup analysis of patients with good therapy adherence compared to patients on a relaxed diet. Durable elevation in Phe levels are only partially associated with macular retinal structural changes. However, therapy adherence might not influence these ophthalmological complications."

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU; also known as phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) deficiency) is an autosomal recessive disorder of phenylalanine metabolism, in which especially high phenylalanine concentrations cause brain dysfunction. If untreated, this brain dysfunction results in severe intellectual disability, epilepsy and behavioural problems. The prevalence varies worldwide, with an average of about 1:10,000 newborns. Early diagnosis is based on newborn screening, and if treatment is started early and continued, intelligence is within normal limits with, on average, some suboptimal neurocognitive function. Dietary restriction of phenylalanine has been the mainstay of treatment for over 60 years and has been highly successful, although outcomes are still suboptimal and patients can find the treatment difficult to adhere to. Pharmacological treatments are available, such as tetrahydrobiopterin, which is effective in only a minority of patients (usually those with milder PKU), and pegylated phenylalanine ammonia lyase, which requires daily subcutaneous injections and causes adverse immune responses. Given the drawbacks of these approaches, other treatments are in development, such as mRNA and gene therapy. Even though PAH deficiency is the most common defect of amino acid metabolism in humans, brain dysfunction in individuals with PKU is still not well understood and further research is needed to facilitate development of pathophysiology-driven treatments."

In this study, we aimed to investigate DNAJC12 deficiency in non-tetrahydrobiopterin-deficient persistent hyperphenylalaninemia cases without biallelic PAH variants in a single pediatric metabolic center. It was determined retrospectively that 471 patients with non-tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency-hyperphenylalaninemia had undergone PAH gene sequencing and 451 patients had biallelic variants in PAH. DNAJC12 sequencing was performed in the remaining 20 patients, identifying a previously reported homozygous splice-site variant (c.158-2A > T) in one patient with axial hypotonia and developmental delay, and a novel, homozygous c.404del (p.Arg135Lysfs*21) frameshift variant in an asymptomatic patient. In segregation analysis, the asymptomatic patient's both parents were also found to be homozygous for this variant and hyperphenylalaninemic. The parents may have had academic difficulties but intellectual disability could not be confirmed due to lack of cooperation. The symptomatic patient significantly benefited from treatment with sapropterin dihydrochloride and neurotransmitter precursors. DNAJC12 deficiency might be responsible for approximately 10% or more of cases with unexplained hyperphenylalaninemia. The phenotypic spectrum is broad, ranging from early infantile hypotonia to incidental diagnosis in adulthood. Similar to tetrahydrobiopterin deficiencies, early diagnosis and treatment with sapropterin dihydrochloride and neurotransmitter precursors can be beneficial, supporting the analysis of DNACJ12 gene in patients with unexplained hyperphenylalaninemia."

Late diagnosis is frequent, leading to death or severe sequelae. Some IEM induce intermediate metabolites circulating in the blood. They may be detected by tandem mass spectrometry. This method allows the simultaneous detection of many IEM in different metabolic pathways. In France, newborn screening (NBS) program for IEM, limited to phenylketonuria for decades, has been recently extended to medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency. Rationale, methodology and organization of this new NBS program are described. Seven other IEM (maple syrup urine disease, homocystinuria, tyrosinemia type I, glutaric aciduria type I, isovaleric acidemia, long chain hydroxy-acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, carnitine uptake disorder) should be screened in the next program extension. Efforts are needed to fully understand the predictive value of each abnormal testing at birth, decrease the false positive rate, and develop the adequate management strategies."

It was initially carried out by a bacteriological method, then by fluorometry, and finally, since 2020, by tandem mass spectrometry. More than 35 million newborns have been screened to date. This resulted in the diagnosis of more than 3,500 children with PKU or mild hyperphenylalaninemia. The management of these children has improved over time, in particular thanks to the techniques of biochemistry and molecular genetics which lead to an accurate diagnosis and the arrival of drug treatment by sapropterin. Thanks to this screening, which allows for early management, the prognosis of PKU has been transformed and, although neurological or behavioral problems may arise, these patients are living normally today."

The panel of screened disorders (\"conditions\") then gradually expanded, with a boost in the late 1990's with the introduction of tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), making it possible to screen for 40-50 conditions in one blood spot. The most recent additions to screening programmes (screening for cystic fibrosis, severe combined immunodeficiency and spinal muscular atrophy) were assisted by or realised through the introduction of molecular genetics techniques. For this survey we collected data from 51 European countries. We report on the developments between 2010 and 2020, and highlight the achievements made during this period. We also identify areas where further progress can be made, mainly by exchanging knowledge and learning from experiences in neighbouring countries. Between 2010 and 2020, most NBS programmes in geographical Europe have matured considerably, both in terms of methodology (modernised) and with regards to the panel of conditions screened (expanded). These developments indicate that more collaboration in Europe through European organisations is gaining momentum. Only by working together can we accomplish the timely detection of newborn infants potentially suffering from one of the many rare diseases and take appropriate actions."

Here, we apply a human gut-chip model and a synthetic biotic designed for the treatment of phenylketonuria to demonstrate dose-dependent production of a strain-specific biomarker, to describe human tissue responses to the engineered strain, and to show reduced blood phenylalanine accumulation after administration of the engineered strain. Lastly, we show how in vitro gut-chip models can be used to construct mechanistic models of strain activity and recapitulate the behavior of the engineered strain in a non-human primate model. These data demonstrate that gut-chip models, together with mechanistic models, provide a framework to predict the function of candidate strains in vivo."

Early diagnosis of HPA before the development of symptoms is possible via neonatal screening, facilitating appropriate treatment and reducing mortality and disability rates. This study revealed the prevalence, mutational and phenotypic spectrum, and prognosis of HPA by neonatal screening from January 2001 to September 2020 in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China. Through a retrospective analysis of the information available in the neonatal screening database, the clinical presentations, laboratory data, molecular characteristics and treatment follow-up data of HPA patients detected by neonatal screening were evaluated. We diagnosed 181 patients with HPA from 1 to 957 newborns, giving an incidence of 1:6873. Among these patients, 177 were identified as PAH deficient and four patients were BH4 deficient. The average current age of the patients was 6.38 years old. The most common mutations of PAH were c.728 C > A/ p.Arg243Gln (13.83 %), c.158G > A/ p.Arg53His (9.57 %), c.611 A > G/ p.Tyr204Cys (7.44 %), and c.721 C > T/ p.Arg241Cys (6.38 %).

No influence of long-term metabolic control in PKU on SDQ could be revealed. The 2- to 10-year-old boys with PKU showed significantly higher scores in Prosocial Behavior compared to their healthy peers (<i>P</i> = .032). Likewise, adolescent boys with PKU showed fewer Conduct Problems (parent-report, <i>P</i> = .006). Adolescent girls with PKU rated themselves more often as abnormal in the subscale Emotional Problems compared to their healthy peers (<i>P</i> = .041). This subscale was also responsible for a significantly different Total SDQ Difficulties Score between patients and their parents' report (<i>P</i> = .008). SDQ represents a suitable instrument within the care for patients with PKU. Specific aspects, however, require separate consideration and evaluation with respect to this chronic disease. Special attention should be paid on adolescent PKU girls who seem to be at risk to develop emotional problem."

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene. In phenylketonuria causes various symptoms including severe mental retardation. PAH gene of a classical Phenylketonuria patient was sequenced, and two novel heterozygous mutations, p.Y198N and p.Y204F, were found. This study aimed to reveal the impacts of these variants on the structural stability of the PAH enzyme. <i>In-silico</i> analyses using prediction tools and molecular dynamics simulations were performed. Mutations were introduced to the wild type catalytic monomer and full length tetramer crystal structures. Variant pathogenicity analyses predicted p.Y198N to be damaging, and p.Y204F to be benign by some prediction tools and damaging by others. Simulations suggested p.Y198N mutation cause significant fluctuations in the spatial organization of two catalytic residues in the temperature accelerated MD simulations with the monomer and increased root-mean-square deviations in the tetramer structure. p.Y204F causes noticeable changes in the spatial positioning of T278 suggesting a possible segregation from the catalytic site in temperature accelerated MD simulations with the monomer. This mutation also leads to increased root-mean-square fluctuations in the regulatory domain which may lead to conformational change resulting in inhibition of dimerization and enzyme activation. Our study reports two novel mutations in the PAH gene and gives insight to their effects on the PAH activity. MD simulations did not yield conclusive results that explains the phenotype but gave plausible insight to possible effects which should be investigated further with <i>in-silico</i> and <i>in-vitro</i> studies to assess the roles of these mutations in etiology of PKU.

    "abstract": "Heel blood sampling of newborns plays an important role in the diagnosis of neonatal hypothyroidism, phenylketonuria, and other inherited metabolic diseases. Embracing breast milk sucking (EBMS) can increase the newborn's sense of security and can relieve pain. The purpose of the present study was to explore the effect of EBMS on alleviating the pain of neonatal heel blood sampling. A total of 96 neonates undergoing heel blood screening were selected from June 2019 to June 2020, and were randomly divided into 2 groups (n=48 in each group). The control group was given routine intervention, and the observation group was given EBMS intervention. The success rate and time-consuming of 1-time blood collection, heel congestion after blood collection, crying time and bleeding time of newborns, blood oxygen saturation and heart rate index, and pain were compared between the 2 groups. The success rate of 1-time blood collection in the observation group was higher than that in the control group, and the blood collection time was shorter than that in the control group (P<0.05). The heel congestion in the observation group was better than that in the control group (P<0.05). The crying time and bleeding time of newborns in the observation group were significantly shorter than those in the control group (P<0.05). The blood oxygen saturation of the observation group was higher, and the heart rate was lower than the control group (P<0.05). The total Neonatal Infant Pain Scale (NIPS) score of the observation group was lower than that of the control group (P<0.05). EBMS can improve the success rate of 1-time blood collection; shorten the time of blood collection; ensure that blood oxygen saturation and heart rate are at normal values; and effectively reduce the occurrence of heel congestion after blood collection, crying time and bleeding time of newborn heel blood collection, and neonatal pain."

    "abstract": "Trace elements in dried blood spots (DBSs) from newborns were determined by laser ablation coupled with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, and data were subjected to chemometric evaluation in an attempt to classify healthy newborns and newborns suffering from metabolic disorders. Unsupervised [principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis (CA)] and supervised [linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and soft independent modeling by class analogy (SIMCA)] pattern recognition techniques were used as classification techniques. PCA and CA have shown a clear tendency to form two groups (healthy newborns and newborns suffering from metabolic disorders). LDA and SIMCA have predicted that 90.5% and 83.9% of originally grouped healthy newborn cases were correctly classified by LDA and SIMCA, respectively. In addition, these percentages were 97.6% (LDA) and 80.6% (SIMCA) for DBSs from newborns suffering from metabolic disorders. However, SIMCA has only detected one misclassified DBS from the healthy group, and the lower percentage is attributed to four DBSs from the healthy newborn group and five DBSs from newborns with disorders that were found as belonging to both categories (healthy newborns and newborns with disorders) in the training set. LDA also gave a percentage of grouped maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) cases correctly classified of 100%, although the percentage fells to 66.7% when classifying phenylketonuria (PKU) cases. Finally, essential elements such as Fe, K, Rb, and Zn were found to be matched (correlated) with the concentration of amino acids such as phenylalanine, valine, and leucine, biomarkers linked with MSUD and PKU diseases."

In phenylketonuria (PKU), protein substitutes provide most of the nitrogen, either as amino acids (AA) or glycomacropeptide with supplementary amino acids (CGMP-AA). Body composition and growth are important indicators of long-term health. In a 3-year prospective study comparing the impact of AA and CGMP-AA on body composition and growth in PKU, 48 children were recruited. <i>N</i> = 19 (median age 11.1 years, range 5-15 years) took AA only, <i>n</i> = 16 (median age 7.3 years, range 5-15 years) took a combination of CGMP-AA and AA, (CGMP50) and 13 children (median age 9.2 years, range 5-16 years) took CGMP-AA only (CGMP100). A dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan at enrolment and 36 months measured LBM, % body fat (%BF) and fat mass (FM). Height was measured at enrolment, 12, 24 and 36 months. No correlation or statistically significant differences (after adjusting for age, gender, puberty and phenylalanine blood concentrations) were found between the three groups for LBM, %BF, FM and height. The change in height z scores, (AA 0, CGMP50 +0.4 and CGMP100 +0.7) showed a trend that children in the CGMP100 group were taller, had improved LBM with decreased FM and % BF but this was not statistically significant. There appeared to be no advantage of CGMP-AA compared to AA on body composition after 3-years of follow-up. Although statistically significant differences were not reached, a trend towards improved body composition was observed with CGMP-AA when it provided the entire protein substitute requirement."

    "abstract": "Japanese newborn screening (NBS) for phenylketonuria (PKU) was initiated in 1977. We surveyed the neurological outcomes of Japanese adult patients with PKU to investigate the long-term effects and of and issues with NBS. Eighty-five patients with PKU aged over 19 years who continued to be treated with a phenylalanine-free amino acid formula were investigated by administering questionnaires regarding clinical characteristics, such as mental ability, education status, and therapeutic condition. Of the 85 subjects, 68 patients were detected by NBS (NBS group), while the other 17 were clinically diagnosed before the initiation of NBS (pre-NBS group). Further, 10 of the 68 NBS patients presented intellectual and/or psychiatric disabilities, 5 of whom had a history of treatment discontinuation; in contrast, 12 of the 17 pre-NBS patients presented with neuropsychiatric symptoms. Regarding social outcomes, almost all patients in the NBS group could live an independent life, while over half of the patients in the pre-NBS group were not employed or lived in nursing-care facilities. Neurological outcomes are obviously improved by NBS in Japan. However, some patients, even those detected by NBS, developed neuropsychiatric symptoms due to treatment disruption. Lifelong and strict management is essential to maintain good neurological and social prognoses for patients with PKU."

    "abstract": "COVID19 pandemic urged the need to take severe measures for reducing the epidemic spread. Lockdowns were imposed throughout countries and even Inborn errors of metabolism (IEMs) affected patients had to face it and adapt, with management strategies changes coming along. Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an inborn error of phenylalanine (Phe) metabolism causing, when not treated, blood Phe increases and consequent central nervous system (CNS) damage. Dietary intervention is the main recognized treatment and must be maintained long-life, however adherence is often suboptimal in adulthood. Aim of this study was to evaluate whether and how the pandemic had impacted PKUs metabolic control and what factors may have played a role as potential modifiers. Patients ≥4 yo and in follow-up at our Metabolic Clinic were enrolled in this study, divided into subgroups according to age (GROUP A < 12 yo; GROUP B ≥ 12 yo). Videoconsults were conducted on a minimum monthly basis and collected DBS were studied and compared to previous year same time-period in order to evaluate possible changes. 39% of patients (<i>n</i> = 121) increased the number of performed DBS. \"Non-compliant\" patients were reduced (11-3%) with a - 14% of patients with mean Phe levels >600 umol/l and a - 8% of patients with 100% DBS above same level. GROUP A maintained substantially unchanged metabolic control among two analyzed time-periods. On the contrary, GROUP B demonstrated significant reductions in mean blood Phe concentrations (<i>p</i> < 0.0001) during the pandemic (mean 454 umol/l, SD ± 252, vs. 556.4 umol/l, SD ± 301). COVID19 pandemic strongly impacted people's life with lifestyle habits changing consistently. PKU patients had to adapt their dietary restrictions to the new environment they were exposed to and, if younger patients could have been less exposed (meals strictly according to diet plan independently from setting), adolescent and adults strongly reflected the obligation to stay home by showing better metabolic control. Multiple factors could have played a role in that and the availability of teleconsultancy may have contributed allowing easier connections, but our data demonstrate how the pandemic and the environment can strongly impact PKUs adherence to treatment and how removing distance barriers can ameliorate and optimize metabolic compliance."

Dysfunction in BH<sub>4</sub> metabolism leads to reduced cofactor levels and may result in systemic hyperphenylalaninemia and/or neurological sequelae due to secondary deficiency in monoamine neurotransmitters in the central nervous system. More than 1100 patients with BH<sub>4</sub> deficiency and 800 different allelic variants distributed throughout the individual genes are tabulated in database of pediatric neurotransmitter disorders PNDdb. Here we provide an update on the molecular-genetic analysis and structural considerations of these variants, including the clinical courses of the genotypes. From a total of 324 alleles, 11 are associated with the autosomal recessive form of GTPCH deficiency presenting with hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA) and neurotransmitter deficiency, 295 GCH1 variant alleles are detected in the dominant form of L-dopa-responsive dystonia (DRD or Segawa disease) while phenotypes of 18 alleles remained undefined. Autosomal recessive variants observed in the PTS (199 variants), PCBD1 (32 variants), and QDPR (141 variants) genes lead to HPA concomitant with central monoamine neurotransmitter deficiency, while SPR deficiency (104 variants) presents without hyperphenylalaninemia. The clinical impact of reported variants is essential for genetic counseling and important for development of precision medicine."

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is the most common inborn error of metabolism of the liver, and results from mutations of both alleles of the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene (PAH). As such, it is a suitable target for gene therapy via gene delivery with a recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector. Here we use the synthetic AAV vector Anc80 via systemic administration to deliver a functional copy of a codon-optimized human PAH gene, with or without an intron spacer, to the Pah<sup>enu2</sup> mouse model of PKU. Dose-dependent transduction of the liver and expression of PAH mRNA were present with both vectors, resulting in significant and durable reduction of circulating phenylalanine, reaching near control levels in males. Coat color of treated Pah<sup>enu2</sup> mice reflected an increase in pigmentation from brown to the black color of control animals, further indicating functional restoration of phenylalanine metabolism and its byproduct melanin. There were no adverse effects associated with administration of AAV up to 5 × 10<sup>12</sup> VG/kg, the highest dose tested. Only minor and/or transient variations in some liver enzymes were observed in some of the AAV-dosed animals which were not associated with pathology findings in the liver. Finally, there was no impact on cell turnover or apoptosis as evaluated by Ki-67 and TUNEL staining, further supporting the safety of this approach. This study demonstrates the therapeutic potential of AAV Anc80 to safely and durably cure PKU in a mouse model, supporting development for clinical consideration."

    "abstract": "Lab-on-paper, or microfluidic paper-based analytical devices (μPADs), use paper as a substrate material, and are patterned with a system of microchannels, reaction zones and sensing elements to perform analysis and detection. The sample transfer in such devices is performed by capillary action. As a result, external driving forces are not required, and hence the size and cost of the device are significantly reduced. Lab-on-paper devices have thus attracted significant attention for point-of-care medical diagnostic purposes in recent years, particularly in less-developed regions of the world lacking medical resources and infrastructures. This review discusses the major advances in lab-on-paper technology for blood analysis and diagnosis in the past five years. The review focuses particularly on the many clinical applications of lab-on-paper devices, including diabetes diagnosis, acute myocardial infarction (AMI) detection, kidney function diagnosis, liver function diagnosis, cholesterol and triglyceride (TG) analysis, sickle-cell disease (SCD) and phenylketonuria (PKU) analysis, virus analysis, C-reactive protein (CRP) analysis, blood ion analysis, cancer factor analysis, and drug analysis. The review commences by introducing the basic transmission principles, fabrication methods, structural characteristics, detection techniques, and sample pretreatment process of modern lab-on-paper devices. A comprehensive review of the most recent applications of lab-on-paper devices to the diagnosis of common human diseases using blood samples is then presented. The review concludes with a brief summary of the main challenges and opportunities facing the lab-on-paper technology field in the coming years."

    "abstract": "Classical phenylketonuria (PKU, OMIM 261600) owes to hepatic deficiency of phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) that enzymatically converts phenylalanine (Phe) to tyrosine (Tyr). PKU neurologic phenotypes include impaired brain development, decreased myelination, early onset mental retardation, seizures, and late-onset features (neuropsychiatric, Parkinsonism). PAH deficiency leads to systemic hyperphenylalaninemia; however, the impact of Phe varies between tissues. To characterize tissue response to hyperphenylalaninemia, metabolomics was applied to tissue from therapy noncompliant classical PKU patients (blood, liver), the Pah<sup>enu2</sup> classical PKU mouse (blood, liver, brain) and the PAH deficient pig (blood, liver, brain, cerebrospinal fluid). In blood, liver, and CSF from both patients and animal models over-represented analytes were principally Phe, Phe catabolites, and Phe-related analytes (conjugates, Phe-containing dipeptides). In addition to Phe and Phe-related analytes, the metabolomic profile of PKU brain tissue (mouse, pig) evidenced oxidative stress responses and energy dysregulation. In Pah<sup>enu2</sup> and PKU pig brain tissues, anti-oxidative response by glutathione and homocarnosine is apparent. Oxidative stress in Pah<sup>enu2</sup> brain was further demonstrated by increased reactive oxygen species. In Pah<sup>enu2</sup> and PKU pig brain, an increased NADH/NAD ratio suggests a respiratory chain dysfunction. Respirometry in PKU brain mitochondria (mouse, pig) functionally confirmed reduced respiratory chain activity. Glycolysis pathway analytes are over-represented in PKU brain tissue (mouse, pig). PKU pathologies owe to liver metabolic deficiency; yet, PKU liver tissue (mouse, pig, human) shows neither energy disruption nor anti-oxidative response. Unique aspects of metabolomic homeostasis in PKU brain tissue along with increased reactive oxygen species and respiratory chain deficit provide insight to neurologic disease mechanisms. While some elements of assumed, long standing PKU neuropathology are enforced by metabolomic data (e.g. reduced tryptophan and serotonin representation), energy dysregulation and tissue oxidative stress expand mechanisms underlying neuropathology."

    "abstract": "Tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency (BH4D), a less common form of hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA), can lead to severe developmental retardation if untreated. Little has been reported on the prevalence of BH4D among live births worldwide. This study examined its prevalence across China and between geographical areas within the country. We analyzed data from the Chinese national screening program for HPA in newborns between 2013 and 2019. BH4D prevalence was examined by province, region and the entire country. Provincial-level prevalence was estimated from the number of confirmed BH4D cases and screened newborns, after adjusting for HPA-positive recall rate. Regional- and national-level prevalences were estimated by summing provincial-level prevalences after weighting them by the number of live births. A Poisson distribution was assumed in order to calculate 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for prevalence. Among 107,078,115 newborns screened for HPA in China, 380 with BH4D were identified, corresponding to a total prevalence of 3.8 per 1,000,000 live births. Prevalence was higher in eastern regions (5.9 per 1,000,000) and northern regions (4.1 per 1,000,000) of China than in southern regions (1.6 per 1,000,000) or northwestern regions (1.7 per 1,000,000). Across the entire country, 3.9% cases of HPA were diagnosed as BH4D, and this proportion reached as high as 15.1% in the southern part of the country. These first insights into BH4D prevalence across China suggest slightly higher prevalence than in other countries, and it varies substantially by region. More attention should be paid to early diagnosis and timely treatment of BH4D."

    "abstract": "The purpose of neonatal screening is the early detection of congenital metabolic and endocrine disorders that, if untreated, could lead to fatal crises or other long-term adverse sequelae. In Germany, neonatal screening is legally regulated. Quality-assurance reports (\"DGNS reports\") are created and published annually by the German Society for Neonatal Screening (Deutsche Gesellschaft für Neugeborenen-Screening). Data from the DGNS reports for the years 2006-2018 serve as the basis of the present publication. For the years 2006-2018, prevalences were calculated and data on process quality were evaluated. Among 9 218 538 births, 6917 neonates were identified who had one of the target diseases. The overall prevalence was 75 per 100 000 neonates; the disorders most commonly found were congenital hypothyroidism (30 per 100 000) followed by phenylketonuria (PKU) and medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MCAD) (10 per 100 000 each). Of the 272 205 follow-up screenings requested, 80% were received. The rate of positive screening findings (recall rate) declined over the observation period, from 0.90% in 2006 to 0.37% in 2018. For every five positive screening findings, one case of a target disorder was confirmed. 79% of the children for whom treatment was indicated began to receive treatment within two weeks. The low recall rate and the early initiation of treatment in 79% of the affected children indicate that neonatal screening for metabolic and endocrine disorders in Germany is effective. The incorporation of tracking structures and the introduction of a registry could further improve the quality of the program."

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is caused by autosomal recessive variants in phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH), leading to systemic accumulation of L-phenylalanine (L-Phe) that may reach neurotoxic levels. A homozygous Pah-R261Q mouse, with a highly prevalent misfolding variant in humans, reveals the expected hepatic PAH activity decrease, systemic L-Phe increase, L-tyrosine and L-tryptophan decrease, and tetrahydrobiopterin-responsive hyperphenylalaninemia. Pah-R261Q mice also present unexpected traits, including altered lipid metabolism, reduction of liver tetrahydrobiopterin content, and a metabolic profile indicative of oxidative stress. Pah-R261Q hepatic tissue exhibits large ubiquitin-positive, amyloid-like oligomeric aggregates of mutant PAH that colocalize with selective autophagy markers. Together, these findings reveal that PKU, customarily considered a loss-of-function disorder, can also have toxic gain-of-function contribution from protein misfolding and aggregation. The proteostasis defect and concomitant oxidative stress may explain the prevalence of comorbid conditions in adult PKU patients, placing this mouse model in an advantageous position for the discovery of mutation-specific biomarkers and therapies."

Often HPABH4 patients receive the same therapy as phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) -deficiency (phenylketonuria) patients-dietary treatment-and do not receive substitutive BH4 therapy until the diagnosis is confirmed by molecular genetic means. In this study, we present a cohort of 30 Russian patients with HPABH4 with detected variants in genes causing different types of HPA. Family diagnostics and biochemical urinary pterin spectrum analyses were carried out. HPABH4A is shown to be the prevalent type, 83.3% of all HPABH4 cases. The mutation spectrum for the PTS gene was defined, the most common variants in Russia were p.Thr106Met-32%, p.Asn72Lys-20%, p.Arg9His-8%, p.Ser32Gly-6%. We also detected 7 novel PTS variants and 3 novel QDPR variants. HPABH4 prevalence was estimated to be 0.5-0.9% of all HPA cases in Russia, which is significantly lower than in European countries on average, China, and Saudi Arabia. The results of this research show the necessity of introducing differential diagnostics for HPABH4 into neonatal screening practice."

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a disease of the catabolism of phenylalanine (Phe), caused by an impaired function of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. Therapeutics is based on the restriction of Phe intake, which mostly requires a modification of the diet. Dietary restrictions can lead to imbalances in specific nutrients, including lipids. In the present study, the plasma phospholipidome of PKU and healthy children (CT) was analyzed by hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Using this approach, 187 lipid species belonging to nine different phospholipid classes and three ceramides were identified. Principal component analysis of the lipid species data set showed a distinction between PKU and CT groups. Univariate analysis revealed that 146 species of phospholipids were significantly different between both groups. Lipid species showing significant variation included phosphatidylcholines, containing polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), which were more abundant in PKU. The high level of PUFA-containing lipid species in children with PKU may be related to a diet supplemented with PUFA. This study was the first report comparing the plasma polar lipidome of PKU and healthy children, highlighting that the phospholipidome of PKU children is significantly altered compared to CT. However, further studies with larger cohorts are needed to clarify whether these changes are specific to phenylketonuric children."

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a genetic disease caused by deficient activity of human phenylalanine hydroxylase (hPAH) that, when untreated, can lead to severe psychomotor impairment. Protein misfolding is recognized as the main underlying pathogenic mechanism of PKU. Therefore, the use of stabilizers of protein structure and/or activity is an attractive therapeutic strategy for this condition. Here, we report that 3-hydroxyquinolin-2(1H)-one derivatives can act as protectors of hPAH enzyme activity. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy demonstrated that the 3-hydroxyquinolin-2(1H)-one compounds affect the coordination of the non-heme ferric center at the enzyme active-site. Moreover, surface plasmon resonance studies showed that these stabilizing compounds can be outcompeted by the natural substrate l-phenylalanine. Two of the designed compounds functionally stabilized hPAH by maintaining protein activity. This effect was observed on the recombinant purified protein and in a cellular model. Besides interacting with the catalytic iron, one of the compounds also binds to the N-terminal regulatory domain, although to a different location from the allosteric l-Phe binding site, as supported by the solution structures obtained by small-angle X-ray scattering."

    "abstract": "Neonatal screening (NBS) was initiated in Europe during the 1960s with the screening for phenylketonuria. The panel of screened disorders (\"conditions\") then gradually expanded, with a boost in the late 1990s with the introduction of tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), making it possible to screen for 40-50 conditions using a single blood spot. The most recent additions to screening programmes (screening for cystic fibrosis, severe combined immunodeficiency and spinal muscular atrophy) were assisted by or realised through the introduction of molecular technologies. For this survey, we collected data from 51 European countries. We report the developments between 2010 and 2020 and highlight the achievements reached with the progress made in this period. We also identify areas where further progress can be made, mainly by exchanging knowledge and learning from experiences in neighbouring countries. Between 2010 and 2020, most NBS programmes in geographical Europe matured considerably, both in terms of methodology (modernised) and with regard to the panel of conditions screened (expanded). These developments indicate that more collaboration in Europe through European organisations is gaining momentum. We can only accomplish the timely detection of newborn infants potentially suffering from one of the many rare diseases and take appropriate action by working together."

    "abstract": "The traditional treatment for phenylketonuria (PKU) is a phenylalanine (Phe)-restricted diet, supplemented with a Phe-free/low-Phe protein substitute. Pharmaceutical treatment with synthetic tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), an enzyme cofactor, allows a patient subgroup to relax their diet. However, dietary protocols guiding the adjustments of protein equivalent intake from protein substitute with BH4 treatment are lacking. We systematically reviewed protein substitute usage with long-term BH4 therapy. Electronic databases were searched for articles published between January 2000 and March 2020. Eighteen studies (306 PKU patients) were eligible. Meta-analyses demonstrated a significant increase in Phe and natural protein intakes and a significant decrease in protein equivalent intake from protein substitute with cofactor therapy. Protein substitute could be discontinued in 51% of responsive patients, but was still required in 49%, despite improvement in Phe tolerance. Normal growth was maintained, but micronutrient deficiency was observed with BH4 treatment. A systematic protocol to increase natural protein intake while reducing protein substitute dose should be followed to ensure protein and micronutrient requirements are met and sustained. We propose recommendations to guide healthcare professionals when adjusting dietary prescriptions of PKU patients on BH4. Studies investigating new therapeutic options in PKU should systematically collect data on protein substitute and natural protein intakes, as well as other nutritional factors."

    "title": "The Adult Phenylketonuria (PKU) Gut Microbiome.",
    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an inborn error of phenylalanine metabolism primarily treated through a phenylalanine-restrictive diet that is frequently supplemented with an amino acid formula to maintain proper nutrition. Little is known of the effects of these dietary interventions on the gut microbiome of PKU patients, particularly in adults. In this study, we sequenced the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene from stool samples collected from adults with PKU (<i>n</i> = 11) and non-PKU controls (<i>n</i> = 21). Gut bacterial communities were characterized through measurements of diversity and taxa abundance. Additionally, metabolic imputation was performed based on detected bacteria. Gut community diversity was lower in PKU individuals, though this effect was only statistically suggestive. A total of 65 genera across 5 phyla were statistically differentially abundant between PKU and control samples (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Additionally, we identified six metabolic pathways that differed between groups (<i>p</i> < 0.05), with four enriched in PKU samples and two in controls. While the child PKU gut microbiome has been previously investigated, this is the first study to explore the gut microbiome of adult PKU patients. We find that microbial diversity in PKU children differs from PKU adults and highlights the need for further studies to understand the effects of dietary restrictions."

    "title": "Study of the l-Phenylalanine Ammonia-Lyase Penetration Kinetics and the Efficacy of Phenylalanine Catabolism Correction Using In Vitro Model Systems.",
    "abstract": "The kinetics of l-phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) penetration into the monolayer of liver cells after its release from capsules was studied. The studies showed the absence of the effect of the capsule shell based on plant hydrocolloids on the absorption of l-phenylalanine ammonia-lyase in systems simulating the liver surface. After 120 min of incubation, in all variants of the experiment, from 87.0 to 96.8% of the enzyme penetrates the monolayer of liver cells. The combined analysis of the results concludes that the developed encapsulated form of l-phenylalanine ammonia-lyase is characterized by high efficiency in correcting the disturbed catabolism of phenylalanine in phenylketonuria, which is confirmed by the results of experiments carried out on in vitro model systems. PAL is approved for the treatment of adult patients with phenylketonuria. The encapsulated l-phenylalanine ammonia-lyase form can find therapeutic application in the phenylketonuria treatment after additional in vitro and in vivo studies, in particular, the study of preparation safety indicators. Furthermore, it demonstrated high efficacy in tumor regression and the treatment of tyrosine-related metabolic disorders such as tyrosinemia. Several therapeutically valuable metabolites biosynthesized by PAL via its catalytic action are included in food supplements, antimicrobial peptides, drugs, amino acids, and their derivatives. PAL, with improved pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties, is a highly effective medical drug."

    "abstract": "Prior to the introduction of newborn screening, Phenylketonuria (PKU) was a devastating disorder with affected individuals usually committed to a life in care in large institutions (asylums). Newborn screening only began after it was shown that those with PKU could be treated with a modified diet and could subsequently lead normal lives. The first production of a diet and the demonstration of its effectiveness was thus a key milestone in the history of both PKU and newborn screening, and took place in Birmingham, UK, in 1951. The pioneers were a two-year-old girl called Sheila Jones, her mother Mary, and three dedicated professionals at Birmingham Children's Hospital: Evelyn Hickmans, John Gerrard and Horst Bickel. Together, they changed the course of PKU for those across the world. This review summarises the history and achievements of this team who opened the door to PKU treatment and the introduction of newborn screening."

Reportedly, the p.R53H(c.158G>A) variant is common in patients with HPA in East Asia. Here, we aimed to define the association between p.R53H and HPA phenotype, and study the long-term outcome of patients with HPA carrying p.R53H. We retrospectively reviewed the genotype in 370 patients detected by newborn screening, and identified the phenotype in 280 (117, HPA; 163, PKU). p.R413P(c.1238G>C) was the most frequently found (<i>n</i> = 117, 31.6%) variant, followed by <i>p.R53H</i> (<i>n</i> = 89, 24.1%). The odds ratio for heterozygous p.R53H to cause HPA was 48.3 (95% CI 19.410-120.004). Furthermore, we assessed the non-linear association between the phenylalanine (Phe) value and elapsed time using the follow-up data of the blood Phe levels of 73 patients with HPA carrying p.R53H. The predicted levels peaked at 161.9 μmol (95% CI 152.088-172.343) at 50-60 months of age and did not exceed 360 μmol/L during the 210-month long observation period. The findings suggest that patients with HPA, carrying p.R53H, do not need frequent Phe monitoring as against those with PKU. Our study provides convincing evidence to determine clinical management of patients detected through newborn screening in Japan."

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an autosomal recessive inborn error of L-phenylalanine (Phe) metabolism. It is caused by a partial or complete deficiency of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH), which is necessary for conversion of Phe to tyrosine (Tyr). This metabolic error results in buildup of Phe and reduction of Tyr concentration in blood and in the brain, leading to neurological disease and intellectual deficits. Patients exhibit retarded body growth, hypopigmentation, hypocholesterolemia and low levels of neurotransmitters. Here we report first attempt at creating a homozygous Pah knock-out (KO) (Hom) mouse model, which was developed in the C57BL/6 J strain using CRISPR/Cas9 where codon 7 (GAG) in Pah gene was changed to a stop codon TAG. We investigated 2 to 6-month-old, male, Hom mice using comprehensive behavioral and biochemical assays, MRI and histopathology. Age and sex-matched heterozygous Pah-KO (Het) mice were used as control mice, as they exhibit enough PAH enzyme activity to provide Phe and Tyr levels comparable to the wild-type mice. Overall, our findings demonstrate that 6-month-old, male Hom mice completely lack PAH enzyme, exhibit significantly higher blood and brain Phe levels, lower levels of brain Tyr and neurotransmitters along with lower myelin content and have significant behavioral deficit. These mice exhibit phenotypes that closely resemble PKU patients such as retarded body growth, cutaneous hypopigmentation, and hypocholesterolemia when compared to the age- and sex-matched Het mice. Altogether, biochemical, behavioral, and pathologic features of this novel mouse model suggest that it can be used as a reliable translational tool for PKU preclinical research and drug development."

    "abstract": "In patients with phenylketonuria, stability of blood phenylalanine and tyrosine concentrations might influence brain chemistry and therefore patient outcome. This study prospectively investigated the effects of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), as a chaperone of phenylalanine hydroxylase on diurnal and day-to-day variations of blood phenylalanine and tyrosine concentrations. Blood phenylalanine and tyrosine were measured in dried blood spots (DBS) four times daily for 2 days (fasting, before lunch, before dinner, evening) and once daily (fasting) for 6 days in a randomized cross-over design with a period with BH4 and a period without BH4. The sequence was randomized. Eleven proven BH4 responsive PKU patients participated, 5 of them used protein substitutes during BH4 treatment. Natural protein intake and protein substitute dosing was adjusted during the period without BH4 in order to keep DBS phenylalanine levels within target range. Patients filled out a 3-day food diary during both study periods. Variations of DBS phenylalanine and Tyr were expressed in standard deviations (SD) and coefficient of variation (CV). BH4 treatment did not significantly influence day-to-day phenylalanine and tyrosine variations nor diurnal phenylalanine variations, but decreased diurnal tyrosine variations (median SD 17.6 μmol/l, median CV 21.3%, p = 0.01) compared to diet only (median SD 34.2 μmol/l, median CV 43.2%). Consequently, during BH4 treatment diurnal phenylalanine/tyrosine ratio variation was smaller, while fasting tyrosine levels tended to be higher. BH4 did not impact phenylalanine variation but decreased diurnal tyrosine and phenylalanine/tyrosine ratio variations, possibly explained by less use of protein substitute and increased tyrosine synthesis."

However, achieving the recommended Phe levels has been a challenge. This study aimed to investigate factors associated with adherence to PKU treatment among patients followed at a medical genetics public service in southern Brazil. Twenty-nine patients (early diagnosed, n = 20; late-diagnosed, n = 9) with classical (n = 16) or mild PKU (n = 13) aged 6-34 years (16.4 ± 7.5) and 16 caregivers were included. Blood Phe levels were recorded, and assessment tools measuring barriers to treatment, IQ, knowledge about disease, treatment, and perceived adherence were collected. Classical PKU patients showed higher current blood Phe levels than mild PKU patients (U = 37.000, p = 0.003). Lifetime and childhood Phe levels were associated with recent metabolic control (τ = 0.76, p = 0.000; τ = 0.70, p = 0.000, respectively). The perception of barriers to treatment was associated with a higher blood Phe level (τ = 0.39, p = 0.003). Tolerance to Phe, metabolic control throughout childhood, and perceived difficulty in living with demands of treatment are important factors of greater vulnerability to poor adherence in PKU patients."

    "abstract": "Latin America is a region consisting of 20 countries that present a wide diversity in terms of a geographic area as well as demographics, ethnicity, economy, social, and healthcare systems. This diversity also applies to the newborn screening (NBS) activities, as demonstrated by the start dates and modalities of implementation as organized programs, the panel of diseases screened for, the available technologies for testing, the coverage, the legislation in force, and the degree of development and success reached. Based on these characteristics, Latin American countries can currently be classified into five groups ranging from fully established national programs to no program at all. Sixteen countries have national or regional NBS programs, but up to date only 14 are actively working. The other 2 have organized programs conducted by different health services providers, but without any unified national coordination. Only six countries have coverage ≥ 90% and 12 ≥ 70%. Thirteen countries have legislation in force defining NBS as mandatory. The 16 countries that have active NBS programs screen for congenital hypothyroidism, 14 for phenylketonuria, 12 for congenital adrenal hyperplasia and cystic fibrosis, and 8 for galactosemia. NBS by tandem mass spectrometry is implemented at a national level only in two countries. Despite these disparities, sustained and significant growth has become evident in the last decade, highlighted by the implementation of new programs, the increase in coverage, the expansion of the panel diseases, the enactment of new NBS laws, and the increasing involvement of government and public health authorities."

    "abstract": "The identification of disease biomarkers plays a crucial role in developing diagnostic strategies for inborn errors of metabolism and understanding their pathophysiology. A primary metabolite that accumulates in the inborn error phenylketonuria is phenylalanine, however its levels do not always directly correlate with clinical outcomes. Here we combine infrared ion spectroscopy and NMR spectroscopy to identify the Phe-glucose Amadori rearrangement product as a biomarker for phenylketonuria. Additionally, we find analogous amino acid-glucose metabolites formed in the body fluids of patients accumulating methionine, lysine, proline and citrulline. Amadori rearrangement products are well-known intermediates in the formation of advanced glycation end-products and have been associated with the pathophysiology of diabetes mellitus and ageing, but are now shown to also form under conditions of aminoacidemia. They represent a general class of metabolites for inborn errors of amino acid metabolism that show potential as biomarkers and may provide further insight in disease pathophysiology."

    "abstract": "Reliable measurement of phenylalanine (Phe) is a prerequisite for adequate follow-up of phenylketonuria (PKU) patients. However, previous studies have raised concerns on the intercomparability of plasma and dried blood spot (DBS) Phe results. In this study, we made an inventory of differences in (pre-)analytical methodology used for Phe determination across Dutch laboratories, and compared DBS and plasma results. Through an online questionnaire, we assessed (pre-)analytical Phe measurement procedures of seven Dutch metabolic laboratories. To investigate the difference between plasma and DBS Phe, participating laboratories received simultaneously collected plasma-DBS sets from 23 PKU patients. In parallel, 40 sample sets of DBS spotted from either venous blood or capillary fingerprick were analyzed. Our data show that there is no consistency on standard operating procedures for Phe measurement. The association of DBS to plasma Phe concentration exhibits substantial inter-laboratory variation, ranging from a mean difference of -15.5% to +30.6% between plasma and DBS Phe concentrations. In addition, we found a mean difference of +5.8% in Phe concentration between capillary DBS and DBS prepared from venous blood. The results of our study point to substantial (pre-)analytical variation in Phe measurements, implicating that bloodspot Phe results should be interpreted with caution, especially when no correction factor is applied. To minimize variation, we advocate pre-analytical standardization and analytical harmonization of Phe measurements, including consensus on application of a correction factor to adjust DBS Phe to plasma concentrations."

This study aims to evaluate the impact of telemedicine for monitoring and treatment of PKU patients on metabolic outcome during coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) outbreak. <b><i>Materials and Methods:</i></b> Patients who were diagnosed as PKU and treated with low Phe diet, tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), or BH4 adjunct with low Phe diet were enrolled. Study period was divided into two periods: prepandemic period wherein patients were followed up in outpatients' clinic and during pandemic wherein telemedicine was used. Demographic findings, laboratory results, and therapy responses were reviewed retrospectively and compared between the two periods. All procedures were in accordance with the ethical standards of the local ethical committee of Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty (17/11/2020-151640) and with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 2013. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Ninety-three (<i>n</i> = 93) patients were enrolled to this study. The ratio of the samples with Phe levels in the recommended ranges was found to be statistically higher during the pandemic wherein an online monitoring system was used in all treatment modalities (<i>p</i>< 0.05). The decrease in Phe washout frequency was statistically significant during the pandemic in the low Phe diet group (p < 0.05). Considering the relationship between Phe tolerance before and during the pandemic, a significant increase in Phe tolerance was noted during the pandemic in the low Phe diet group (<i>p</i>< 0.05). <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> Telemedicine can be an appropriate and effective monitoring option for PKU patients during the COVID-19 pandemic."

This study aimed to assess the specific heterogeneity of PAH variants found in Thai population as well as evaluate enzyme activity and expression of novel variants. PAH gene from 13 patients was analyzed by PCR amplification and direct Sanger-sequencing of 13 exons of the coding region. The novel variants were transiently transfected in COS-7 cells for functional verification. Eleven different PAH variants were identified: all pathogenic variants were missense variants, of which the most frequent variant was p.R169L, accounting for 24% (6/25) of all identified alleles. Two novel variants p.R169L and p.Y317N and previously reported variants with mutated residues at the same positions (p.R169H and p.Y317H) were expressed in COS-7 cells. These showed mildly impaired residual activity levels (42.3-63.1% of wild type), while the protein levels were well expressed (82.8-110%), except for p.R169L, which showed decreased protein expression of 55.7% compared to the wild type enzyme. All subjects with p.R169L identified in at least one of pathogenic alleles (one case is homozygous) had a metabolic phenotype of mild hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA). Our data has expanded the information on the genetic heterogeneity of Thai patients with PAH deficiency. This finding emphasizes the importance of genotyping in patients with HPA, and in vitro studies can provide additional information for prediction of phenotype."

However, the amount of phenylalanine provided by aspartame is unidentifiable from food and drinks labels. We performed a cross-sectional online survey aiming to examine the accidental aspartame consumption in PKU. 206 questionnaires (58% female) were completed. 55% of respondents (<i>n</i> = 114) were adults with PKU or their parent/carers and 45% (<i>n</i> = 92) were parents/carers of children with PKU. 74% (<i>n</i> = 152/206) had consumed food/drinks containing aspartame. Repeated accidental aspartame consumption was common and more frequent in children (<i>p</i> < 0.0001). The aspartame containing food/drinks accidentally consumed were fizzy drinks (68%, <i>n</i> = 103/152), fruit squash (40%, <i>n</i> = 61/152), chewing gum (30%, <i>n</i> = 46/152), flavoured water (25%, <i>n</i> = 38/152), ready to drink fruit squash cartons (23%, <i>n</i> = 35/152) and sports drinks (21%, <i>n</i> = 32/152). The main reasons described for accidental consumption, were manufacturers' changing recipes (81%, <i>n</i> = 123/152), inability to check the ingredients in pubs/restaurants/vending machines (59%, <i>n</i> = 89/152) or forgetting to check the label (32%, <i>n</i> = 49/152). 23% (<i>n</i>= 48/206) had been prescribed medicines containing aspartame and 75% (<i>n</i> = 36/48) said that medicines were not checked by medics when prescribed. 85% (<i>n</i> = 164/192) considered the sugar tax made accidental aspartame consumption more likely. Some of the difficulties for patients were aspartame identification in drinks consumed in restaurants, pubs, vending machines (77%, <i>n</i> = 158/206); similarities in appearance of aspartame and non-aspartame products (62%, <i>n</i> = 127/206); time consuming shopping/checking labels (56%, <i>n</i> = 115/206); and unclear labelling (55%, <i>n</i> = 114/206). These issues caused anxiety for the person with PKU (52%, <i>n</i> = 106/206), anxiety for parent/caregivers (46%, <i>n</i> = 95/206), guilt for parent/carers (42%, <i>n</i> = 87/206) and social isolation (42%, <i>n</i> = 87/206). It is important to understand the impact of aspartame and legislation such as the sugar tax on people with PKU.

Retrospective data on metabolic control and number of clinic appointments were collected for each SP, and protein intakes were analysed. In SP2, three patients (6%) were lost to follow-up. There was a small but statistically significant increase in median number of annual blood spots from SP1 to SP2: 11 (7-15) vs. 14 (7-20); <i>p</i> = 0.002. Mean ± SD of median blood Phe remained stable (525 ± 248 µmol/L vs. 552 ± 225 µmol/L; <i>p</i> = 0.100); median % of blood Phe < 480 µmol/L decreased (51 (4-96)% vs. 37 (5-85)%; <i>p</i> = 0.041) and median number of clinic appointments increased from SP1 to SP2: (5 (4-6) vs. 11 (8-13); <i>p</i> < 0.001). No significant differences were found regarding any parameter of protein intake. Our results suggest that the implementation of an adult service was successful as impact on metabolic control was limited and attendance remained high. Continuous dietetic care likely contributed to these results by keeping patients in follow-up and committed to treatment."

Data on family income, housing, and mother's age and schooling level were collected, and anthropometric measures of body composition and distribution were taken. All dosages of phenylalanine (Phe) from the last five years (2015-2019) were evaluated and classified regarding their adequacy (cutoffs: 0-12 years: 2-6 mg/dL; 12-19 years: 2-10 mg/dL). Adequate metabolic control was considered if ≥7%) of the dosages were within desired ranges. The mean (±standard deviation) age in the last year was 10.1±4.6 years. Most of them were under 12 years old (33/53; 62.3%) and had the classic form of the disease (39/53; 73.6%). Better metabolic control was observed among adolescents (68.4 versus 51.4%; p=0.019). Overweight was found in 9/53 (17%) and higher serum Phe levels (p<0.001) were found in this group of patients. Metabolic control with 70% or more Phe level adequacy decreased along with the arm muscle area (AMA) (ptendency=0.042), being 70.0% among those with low reserve (low AMA), and 18.5% among those with excessive reserve (high AMA). Adequate metabolic control was observed in most patients. The findings suggest that, in this sample, the levels of phenylalanine may be related to changes in body composition."

The symptoms of DMD share similarities with those of accelerated aging. Recently, hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) supplementation has been suggested to modulate the effects of age-related decline in muscle function, and metabolic H<sub>2</sub>S deficiencies have been implicated in affecting muscle mass in conditions such as phenylketonuria. We therefore evaluated the use of sodium GYY4137 (NaGYY), a H<sub>2</sub>S-releasing molecule, as a possible approach for DMD treatment. Using the <i>dys-1(eg</i>33<i>) Caenorhabditis elegans</i> DMD model, we found that NaGYY treatment (100 µM) improved movement, strength, gait, and muscle mitochondrial structure, similar to the gold-standard therapeutic treatment, prednisone (370 µM). The health improvements of either treatment required the action of the kinase JNK-1, the transcription factor SKN-1, and the NAD-dependent deacetylase SIR-2.1. The transcription factor DAF-16 was required for the health benefits of NaGYY treatment, but not prednisone treatment. AP39 (100 pM), a mitochondria-targeted H<sub>2</sub>S compound, also improved movement and strength in the <i>dys-1(eg</i>33<i>)</i> model, further implying that these improvements are mitochondria-based. Additionally, we found a decline in total sulfide and H<sub>2</sub>S-producing enzymes in dystrophin/utrophin knockout mice. Overall, our results suggest that H<sub>2</sub>S deficit may contribute to DMD pathology, and rectifying/overcoming the deficit with H<sub>2</sub>S delivery compounds has potential as a therapeutic approach to DMD treatment."

A total of 129 different PAH gene mutations including, IVS10-11G > A (c.1066-11G > A) (19.23%), p.R261Q (c.782G > A) (7.63%), p.P281L (c.842C > T) (6.24%), IVS2 + 5G > C (c.168 + 5G > C) (5.75%), p.R243* (c.727C > T) (3.59%), IVS9 + 5G > A (c.969 + 5G > A) (2.84%), p.R176* (c.526C > T) (2.42%), p.Lys363Nfs*37 (c.1089delG) (2.13%), IVS11 + 1G > C (c.1199 + 1G > C) (2.07%) and p.L48S (c.143 T > C) (2.04%) were identified. The spectrum and frequency of mutations observed in Iran were closer to those observed in the Mediterranean countries. Our results are valuable in planning panel-based studies in provinces with incomplete data on PAH gene mutations. This study is a good reference for genetic counselors and physicians who advise couples in making decisions to maintain or terminate a pregnancy."

    "title": "Defining tetrahydrobiopterin responsiveness in phenylketonuria: Survey results from 38 countries.",
    "abstract": "A subset of patients with phenylketonuria benefit from treatment with tetrahydrobiopterin (BH<sub>4</sub>), although there is no consensus on the definition of BH<sub>4</sub> responsiveness. The aim of this study therefore was to gain insight into the definitions of long-term BH<sub>4</sub> responsiveness being used around the world. We performed a web-based survey targeting healthcare professionals involved in the treatment of PKU patients. Data were analysed according to geographical region (Europe, USA/Canada, other). We analysed 166 responses. Long-term BH<sub>4</sub> responsiveness was commonly defined using natural protein tolerance (95.6%), improvement of metabolic control (73.5%) and increase in quality of life (48.2%). When a specific value for a reduction in phenylalanine concentrations was reported (n = 89), 30% and 20% were most frequently used as cut-off values (76% and 19% of respondents, respectively). When a specific relative increase in natural protein tolerance was used to define long-term BH<sub>4</sub> responsiveness (n = 71), respondents most commonly reported cut-off values of 30% and 100% (28% of respondents in both cases). Respondents from USA/Canada (n = 50) generally used less strict cut-off values compared to Europe (n = 96). Furthermore, respondents working within the same center answered differently. The results of this study suggest a very heterogeneous situation on the topic of defining long-term BH<sub>4</sub> responsiveness, not only at a worldwide level but also within centers. Developing a strong evidence- and consensus-based definition would improve the quality of BH<sub>4</sub> treatment."

    "title": "Autism: Screening of inborn errors of metabolism and unexpected results.",
    "abstract": "In this study, the aim was to examine patients with inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) who presented with only autism, without any other findings, to suggest any other neurological and genetic disorders. To investigate IEM, data of the hospital records of 247 patients who were referred from pediatric psychiatric to pediatric metabolism outpatient clinics due to further evaluation of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) were examined. Among them, 237 patients were evaluated for IEM leading to ASDs. Organic acidemias, phenylketonuria, tetrahydrobiopterin and neutrotransmitter disorders, biotinidase deficiency, Smith-Lemni-Opitz syndrome, disorders of cerebral creatine metabolism, urea cycle defects, homocystinuria, purine-pyrimidine metabolism disorders, mitochondrial disorders, cerebrotendinous xantomatosis, mucopolysaccaridosis, and glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency were screened with complete blood counts, complete biochemical analyses, homocysteine levels, an arterial blood gase, and metabolic investigations. Six patients were diagnosed as follows: one with phenylketonuria (PKU), one with cerebral creatine deficiency, one with hypobetalipoproteinemia, one with glycogen storage disease type IX-a, one with dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency, and one with succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency (SSADHD). Forty-six patients screened for IEM were from consanguineous families, among them, one was diagnosed with FKU and the other was with SSADHD. It would not be expected to find PKU in a 5-year-old patient as a result of newborn screening, but she could not been screened due to being a refugee. The diagnosed diseases were rare presentations of the diseases and furthermore, the diagnosis of hypobetalipoproteinemia and glycogen storage disease type IX-a were surprising with the only presentation of ASDs. LAY SUMMARY: It is well-known that some types of inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) may present with that of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). This study suggests that in countries where consanguinity marriages are common such as Turkey and refugees whose escaped from neonatal screening are present, patients with ASD should be screened for IEMs. The results can surprise the physicians with a very rare cause of autism that has never been thought.

    "abstract": "In phenylketonuria (PKU), modified casein glycomacropeptide supplements (CGMP-AA) are used as an alternative to the traditional phenylalanine (Phe)-free L-amino acid supplements (L-AA). However, studies focusing on the long-term nutritional status of CGMP-AA are lacking. This retrospective study evaluated the long-term impact of CGMP-AA over a mean of 29 months in 11 patients with a mean age at CGMP-AA onset of 28 years (range 15-43) [8 females; 2 hyperphenylalaninaemia (HPA), 3 mild PKU, 3 classical PKU and 3 late-diagnosed]. Outcome measures included metabolic control, anthropometry, body composition and biochemical parameters. CGMP-AA, providing 66% of protein equivalent intake from protein substitute, was associated with no significant change in blood Phe with CGMP-AA compared with baseline (562 ± 289 µmol/L vs 628 ± 317 µmol/L; p = 0.065). In contrast, blood tyrosine significantly increased on CGMP-AA (52.0 ± 19.2 μmol/L vs 61.4 ± 23.8 μmol/L; p = 0.027). Biochemical nutritional markers remained unchanged which is an encouraging finding in adults with PKU, many of whom are unable to maintain full adherence with nutritionally fortified protein substitutes. Longitudinal, prospective studies with larger sample sizes are necessary to fully understand the metabolic impact of using CGMP-AA in PKU."

We investigated Tyr homeostasis in patients with PAH deficiency and the effect of a slow-release amino acids therapy in phenylketonuria (PKU). We performed four complementary investigations: (1) Tyr concentrations were monitored in 114 patients (10.6 ± 11.9 years) with PKU on dietary treatment supplemented with traditional amino acid formulations (n=52, 1175 samples) or non-PKU HPA on a free diet (n=62, 430 samples); (2) Tyr metabolism in PKU was quantitatively evaluated in three patients by a simple Tyr oral loading test (100 mg/kg); (3) diurnal and (4) long-term Tyr concentrations were evaluated in 5 and 13 patients with PKU, respectively, who switched from traditional to slow-release amino acids therapy. 1) Tyr concentrations in the PKU population were subnormal and significantly lower than in non-PKU HPA (p<0.01); (2) the response to a Tyr loading test in PKU was normal, with basal Tyr concentrations reached within 12 h; (3) the diurnal metabolic profile in patients on slow-release amino acids therapy revealed higher morning fasting and nocturnal Tyr concentrations with respect to traditional therapy (p<0.01); (4) this picture was confirmed at follow-up, with normalization of morning fasting Tyr concentrations in patients on slow-release amino acids therapy (p<0.01) and unchanged Phe control (p=0.19). Slow-release amino acids therapy can improve Tyr homeostasis in PKU. If associated to optimized Phe control, such a metabolic goal may allow long-term clinical benefits in patients with PKU."

    "title": "Oxidative stress in phenylketonuria-evidence from human studies and animal models, and possible implications for redox signaling.",
    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is one of the commonest inborn error of amino acid metabolism. Before mass neonatal screening was possible, and the success of introducing diet therapy right after birth, the typical clinical finds in patients ranged from intellectual disability, epilepsy, motor deficits to behavioral disturbances and other neurological and psychiatric symptoms. Since early diagnosis and treatment became widespread, usually only those patients who do not strictly follow the diet present psychiatric, less severe symptoms such as anxiety, depression, sleep pattern disturbance, and concentration and memory problems. Despite the success of low protein intake in preventing otherwise severe outcomes, PKU's underlying neuropathophysiology remains to be better elucidated. Oxidative stress has gained acceptance as a disturbance implicated in the pathogenesis of PKU. The conception of oxidative stress has evolved to comprehend how it could interfere and ultimately modulate metabolic pathways regulating cell function. We summarize the evidence of oxidative damage, as well as compromised antioxidant defenses, from patients, animal models of PKU, and in vitro experiments, discussing the possible clinical significance of these findings. There are many studies on oxidative stress and PKU, but only a few went further than showing macromolecular damage and disturbance of antioxidant defenses. In this review, we argue that these few studies may point that oxidative stress may also disturb redox signaling in PKU, an aspect few authors have explored so far. The reported effect of phenylalanine on the expression or activity of enzymes participating in metabolic pathways known to be responsive to redox signaling might be mediated through oxidative stress."

    "title": "[Diagnosis and monitoring of phenylketonuria by LC-MS-MS in Morocco].",
    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria is an inherited metabolic disease, of autosomal recessive transmission, due to the enzymatic deficit of phenylalanine hydroxylase, which transforms phenylalanine into tyrosine. The deficit leads to an increase in phenylalanine and its metabolite, phenylpyruvic acid which is responsible for the toxicity and symptomatology characterized by serious neurological disorders. Through this work, we wanted to show: 1) the profile of phenylalanine concentrations in a cohort of 52 Moroccan phenylketonuric patients diagnosed in our laboratory by Tandem Mass Spectrometry coupled with HPLC; 2) The value of biological monitoring in the nutritional management of phenylketonuric patients. The results showed that phenylketonuria diagnosed in Morocco is characterized by a predominance of classic and moderate phenylketonuria in both sexes with a median concentration = 1,107 μmol/L, 26 times higher than that observed in the control group (median value = 42 μmol/L - p < 0.0001). The phenylalanine and tyrosine concentrations of 33 phenylketonuric patients regularly monitored by our laboratory highlights the effectiveness of the hypoproteic diet with a marked improvement in psychomotor development, a significant regression in behavioral disorders and an encouraging overall development of children. Conclusion: phenylketonuria is a disease that would be frequent in Morocco but it is still diagnosed at the stage of severe mental retardation. A better management of these patients could be considered when setting up a nation-wide neonatal screening program."

Thirteen exons of the PAH gene were sequenced in 84 cases with phenylketonuria (PKU) diagnosed during neonatal genetic and metabolic disease screening in Shaanxi province, and their mutations were analyzed. We designed and developed a screening kit to detect nine mutation sites covering more than 50% of the PAH mutations found in Shaanxi province (c.728G>A, c.1197A>T, c.331C>T, c.1068C>A, c.611A>G, c.1238G>C, c.721C>T, c.442-1G>A, and c.158G>A) by using amplification refractory mutation system-polymerase chain reaction (ARMS-PCR) combined with fluorescent probe technology. Peripheral blood and dried blood samples from PKU families were used for clinical verification of the newly developed kit. PAH gene mutations were detected in 84 children diagnosed with PKU. A total of 159 mutant alleles were identified, consisting of 100 missense mutations, 28 shear mutations, 24 nonsense mutations, and 7 deletion mutations. Exon 7 had the highest mutation frequency (32.08%). Among them, the mutation frequency of p.R243Q was the highest, accounting for 20.13% of all mutations, followed by p.R111X, IVS4-1G>A, EX6-96A>G, and p.R413P; these five loci accounted for 47.17% (75/159) of all mutations. In addition, we identified three previously unreported PAH gene mutations (p.C334X, p.G46D, and p.G256D). Fifteen mutation sites were identified in the 47 PAH carriers identified by next-generation sequencing (NGS), which were verified by the newly developed kit, with an agreement rate of 100%. This newly developed kit based on ARMS-PCR combined with fluorescent probe technology can be used to detect common PAH gene mutations."

    "title": "Timing of Newborn Blood Collection Alters Metabolic Disease Screening Performance.",
    "abstract": "Blood collection for newborn genetic disease screening is preferably performed within 24-48 h after birth. We used population-level newborn screening (NBS) data to study early postnatal metabolic changes and whether timing of blood collection could impact screening performance. Newborns were grouped based on their reported age at blood collection (AaBC) into early (12-23 h), standard (24-48 h), and late (49-168 h) collection groups. Metabolic marker levels were compared between the groups using effect size analysis, which controlled for group size differences and influence from the clinical variables of birth weight and gestational age. Metabolite level differences identified between groups were correlated to NBS data from false-positive cases for inborn metabolic disorders including carnitine transport defect (CTD), isovaleric acidemia (IVA), methylmalonic acidemia (MMA), and phenylketonuria (PKU). Our results showed that 56% of the metabolites had AaBC-related differences, which included metabolites with either decreasing or increasing levels after birth. Compared to the standard group, the early-collection group had elevated marker levels for PKU (phenylalanine, Cohen's <i>d</i> = 0.55), IVA (C5, Cohen's <i>d</i> = 0.24), MMA (C3, Cohen's <i>d</i> = 0.23), and CTD (C0, Cohen's <i>d</i> = 0.23). These findings correlated with higher false-positive rates for PKU (<i>P</i> < 0.05), IVA (<i>P</i> < 0.05), and MMA (<i>P</i> < 0.001), and lower false-positive rate for CTD (<i>P</i> < 0.001) in the early-collection group. Blood collection before 24 h could affect screening performance for some metabolic disorders. We have developed web-based tools integrating AaBC and other variables for interpretive analysis of screening data."

    "title": "Insights from Animal Models on the Pathophysiology of Hyperphenylalaninemia: Role of Mitochondrial Dysfunction, Oxidative Stress and Inflammation.",
    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an inborn error of metabolism caused by phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) deficiency and characterized by elevated plasma levels of phenylalanine (hyperphenylalaninemia-HPA). In severe cases, PKU patients present with neurological dysfunction and hepatic damage, but the underlying mechanisms are not fully elucidated. Other forms of HPA also characterized by neurological symptoms occur in rare instances due to defects in the metabolism of the PAH cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin. This review aims to gather the knowledge acquired on the phenylalanine-induced toxicity focusing on findings obtained from pre-clinical studies. Mounting evidence obtained from PKU genetic mice, rats submitted to different HPA models, and cell cultures exposed to phenylalanine has shown that high levels of this amino acid impair mitochondrial bioenergetics, provoke changes in oxidative and inflammatory status, and induce apoptosis. Noteworthy, some data demonstrated that phenylalanine-induced oxidative stress occurs specifically in mitochondria. Further studies have shown that the metabolites derived from phenylalanine, namely phenylpyruvate, phenyllactate, and phenylacetate, also disturb oxidative status. Therefore, it may be presumed that mitochondrial damage is one of the most important mechanisms responsible for phenylalanine toxicity. It is expected that the findings reviewed here may contribute to the understanding of PKU and HPA pathophysiology and to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for these disorders."

The present study was aimed at analyzing the policies of the national PKU screening (NaPS) program in Iran. PKU screening program policies were analyzed in compliance with the policy triangle model. Document review and 38 semi-structured interviews were used for data collection. Document review data were analyzed using content analysis, and interview data were analyzed using framework analysis. The national PKU screening (NaPS) program was a decision made at the genetics department of Ministry of Health and Medical Education (MOHME) in Iran. Many internal and external stakeholders were involved in it and valid evidence was used to formulate the policies. Despite some opposition and insufficient support, the program was implemented due to the continuous persistence of parents, interested executives, formulated valid content and a top-down approach. The main barriers included rapid substitution of managers, shortage of Phe-free milk, little awareness of patients' families, social stigma, and inadequate co-operation of some hospital administrators. The policy triangle framework contributed to explaining the different components of the PKU screening program. A successful PKU screening program requires more stability of senior managers in MOHME, enough human resources and Phe-free milk, educating patients' families, and commitment of hospitals administrators. Meanwhile, all the stakeholders need to be involved in the program effectively."

    "abstract": "Protein substitutes developed for phenylketonuria (PKU) are a synthetic source of protein commonly based on L-amino acids. They are essential in the treatment of phenylketonuria (PKU) and other amino acid disorders, allowing the antagonistic amino acid to be removed but with the safe provision of all other amino acids necessary for maintaining normal physiological function. They were first formulated by a chemist and used experimentally on a 2-year-old girl with PKU and their nutritional formulations and design have improved over time. Since 2008, a bioactive macropeptide has been used as a base for protein substitutes in PKU, with potential benefits of improved bone and gut health, nitrogen retention, and blood phenylalanine control. In 2018, animal studies showed that physiomimic technology coating the amino acids with a polymer allows a slow release of amino acids with an improved physiological profile. History has shown that in PKU, the protein substitute's efficacy is determined by its nutritional profile, amino acid composition, dose, timing, distribution, and an adequate energy intake. Protein substitutes are often given little importance, yet their pharmacological actions and clinical benefit are pivotal when managing PKU."

Inborn errors of metabolism may rarely present with autism spectrum disorder symptoms. Careful evaluation of the history, physical examination and additional findings in patients diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder will guide the clinician in the decision-making process and chose the appropriate specific metabolic investigation. An underlying inborn errors of metabolism may be a treatable cause of autism."

    "abstract": "There is broad consensus on the health benefits that neonatal screening has provided in Spain, since Professor Mayor Zaragoza began his research project for the early detection of phenylketonuria and other aminoacidopathies in 1968, to date. In these decades there has been a great evolution and development of Neonatal Screening Programs (NSP) in Spain. This paper presents the effect on the development of the NSPs of the decentralization of Public Health responsibilities in the Autonomous Communities, creating differences among them by atomizing the decisions on the expansion of the diseases to be screened. The availability of effective detection and treatment methods was the justification, often unique, for the inclusion of new diseases in an NSP. On rare occasions, neonatal screening was assumed as a public health program that should offer guarantees of effectiveness, from information for informed consent to the correct treatment and follow-up of detected cases. This situation of enormous inequality in access to neonatal screening has changed with the introduction of appropriate legislation to guaranty the correct development of NSP within the National Health System. Forums coordinated by the Ministry of Health with the participation of those responsible for public health from the Autonomous Communities and scientific societies have been fundamental. An example of the convergence of research and science for the benefit of a basic Public Health program."

However, off-target activity is a concern in the potential use of base editors to treat genetic diseases. Here, we report unbiased analyses of transcriptome-wide and genome-wide off-target modifications effected by cytidine base editors in the liver of mice with phenylketonuria. The intravenous delivery of intein-split cytidine base editors by dual adeno-associated viruses led to the repair of the disease-causing mutation without generating off-target mutations in the RNA and DNA of the hepatocytes. Moreover, the transient expression of a cytidine base editor mRNA and a relevant single-guide RNA intravenously delivered by lipid nanoparticles led to ~21% on-target editing and to the reversal of the disease phenotype; there were also no detectable transcriptome-wide and genome-wide off-target edits. Our findings support the feasibility of therapeutic cytidine base editing to treat genetic liver diseases."

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a metabolic disorder whereby phenylalanine metabolism is deficient due to allelic variations in the gene for phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH). There is no cure for PKU other than orthotopic liver transplantation, and the standard of care for patients is limited to dietary restrictions and key amino acid supplementation. Therefore, Pah was edited in pig fibroblasts for the generation of PKU clone piglets that harbor a common and severe human mutation, R408W. Additionally, the proximal region to the mutation was further humanized by introducing 5 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to allow for development of gene editing machinery that could be translated directly from the pig model to human PKU patients that harbor at least one classic R408W allele. Resulting piglets were hypopigmented (a single Ossabaw piglet) and had low birthweight (all piglets). The piglets had similar levels of PAH expression, but no detectable enzymatic activity, consistent with the human phenotype. The piglets were fragile and required extensive neonatal care to prevent failure to thrive and early demise. Phenylalanine levels rose sharply when dietary Phe was unrestricted but could be rapidly reduced with a low Phe diet. Fibroblasts isolated from R408W piglets show susceptibility to correction using CRISPR or TALEN, with subsequent homology-directed recombination to correct Pah. This pig model of PKU provides a powerful new tool for development of all classes of therapeutic candidates to treat or cure PKU, as well as unique value for proof-of-concept studies for in vivo human gene editing platforms in the context of this humanized PKU allele."

PKU results from mutations within the phenylalanine-4-hydroxylase (PAH) gene that encodes for the PAH protein. The study of all PAH causing mutations is improbable using experimental techniques. In this study, a collection of in silico resources, sorting intolerant from tolerant, Polyphen-2, PhD-SNP, and MutPred were used to identify possible pathogenetic and deleterious PAH non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs). We identified two variants of PAH, I65N and L311P, to be the most deleterious and disease causing nsSNPs. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were carried out to characterize these point mutations on the atomic level. MD simulations revealed increased flexibility and a decrease in the hydrogen bond network for both mutants compared to the native protein. Free energy calculations using the MM/GBSA approach found that BH<sub>4</sub> , a drug-based therapy for PKU patients, had a higher binding affinity for I65N and L311P mutants compared to the wildtype protein. We also identify important residues in the BH<sub>4</sub> binding pocket that may be of interest for the rational drug design of other PAH drug-based therapies. Lastly, free energy calculations also determined that the I65N mutation may impair the dimerization of the N-terminal regulatory domain of PAH."

Over each 2-year interval, the estimate of mean change in FSIQ was -0.5768 with a lower limit of the 95% confidence interval (CI) of -1.60. At the end of the follow-up period (Year 7), the least squares mean estimate of the change in FSIQ from baseline was 1.14 with a lower limit of the 95% CI of -3.53. These lower limits were both within the clinically expected variation of 5 points. During the whole study period, mean blood Phe levels remained within the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) target range of 120-360 μmol/L. In addition, height, weight, and head circumference were maintained within normal ranges throughout follow-up, as defined by growth charts from the World Health Organization (WHO) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for children below and above the age of 24 months, respectively. All patients (n = 65) enrolled in this study experienced at least one adverse event, as expected from previous studies. In conclusion, long-term use of sapropterin in individuals with PKU helps to control blood Phe, preserve intellectual functioning, and maintain normal growth in BH4-responsive children who initiated treatment between the ages of 0 to 6 years."

    "abstract": "Routine newborn screening for many disorders is now so ingrained in newborn care that there is no question about whether it should be done. However, acceptance of newborn screening was not guaranteed when Robert Guthrie introduced it for phenylketonuria (PKU). This article describes the professional and personal story of Guthrie, a physician and microbiologist, who veered from cancer research to a commitment to prevent intellectual disability from PKU. It recounts how Guthrie was able to overcome strong opposition to mandatory screening from prominent physicians and medical societies, so that newborn screening for PKU would be routinely performed throughout the developed world, and would eventually form the basis for the (much more) comprehensive screening conducted today."

    "abstract": "The impairment of the hepatic enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) causes elevation of phenylalanine levels in blood and other body fluids resulting in the most common inborn error of amino acid metabolism (phenylketonuria). Persistently high levels of phenylalanine lead to irreversible damage to the nervous system. Therefore, early diagnosis of the affected individuals is important, as it can prevent clinical manifestations of the disease. In this report, the biochemical and genetic findings performed in 223 patients diagnosed through the Portuguese Neonatal Screening Program (PNSP) are presented. Overall, the results show that a high overlap exists between different types of variants and phenylalanine levels. Molecular analyses reveal a wide mutational spectrum in our population with a total of 56 previously reported variants, most of them found in compound heterozygosity (74% of the patients). Intragenic polymorphic markers were used to assess the haplotypic structure of mutated chromosomes for the most frequent variants found in homozygosity in our population (p.Ile65Thr, p.Arg158Gln, p.Leu249Phe, p.Arg261Gln, p.Val388Met, and c.1066-11G>A). Our data reveal high heterogeneity at the biochemical and molecular levels and are expected to provide a better understanding of the molecular basis of this disease and to provide clues to elucidate genotype-phenotype correlations."

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an autosomal recessive inherited disorder characterised by a deficiency in phenylalanine hydroxylase. Untreated, PKU is associated with a wide range of cognitive and psychiatric sequelae. Contemporary management guidelines recommend lifetime dietary control of phenylalanine (Phe) levels, however many individuals who discontinue dietary control subsequently suffer symptoms of anxiety, depression and disturbances to cognition. We undertook a prospective cohort study of patients with early-treated phenylketonuria who had ceased dietary control to test the hypothesis that resumption of dietary control of PKU is associated with improvements in measures of psychiatric morbidity and cognitive functioning. We re-initiated dietary control for early-treated patients with PKU and monitored cognitive and psychiatric outcomes over a twelve-month period. Assessments included objective cognitive function (measured by cognitive proficiency index (CPI)), anxiety and depression scales. General linear mixed model (GLMM) analyses were performed to assess change in psychometric variables from baseline over twelve months after resumption of dietary control. A total of nine patients were recruited. Mean age was 33 years (SD = 8.75), five were female. Mean time off dietary control was 19.1 years (SD = 11.3), and mean baseline phenylalanine (Phe) levels were 1108 µmol/L (SD = 293). GLMM analysis demonstrated a positive relationship between CPI and time on diet (b = 0.56 [95% CI = 0.17, 0.95]). Age, time off diet, Phe levels and depression scores were not associated with cognitive function. There was a negative relationship between time on diet and anxiety (b = - 0.88 95% CI = [- 1.26, - 0.50]) and depression ratings (b = - 0.61, 95% CI = [- 0.95, - 0.26]). This study demonstrated improvements in cognitive function, anxiety, and depression ratings associated with resumption of dietary control of PKU. Raw Phe levels were not strongly associated with psychiatric or cognitive scores in this cohort. These findings support the importance of lifelong treatment for PKU in improving the cognitive and psychiatric sequelae of the disease."

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an autosomal recessive disorder whereby deficiencies in phenylalanine metabolism cause progressive neurological dysfunction. Managing PKU is challenging, with disease monitoring focussed on short-term phenylalanine control rather than measures of neuronal damage. Conventional imaging lacks sensitivity, however diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI), a new MRI method may reveal subclinical white matter structural changes in PKU. This cohort study involved adults with PKU recruited during routine clinical care. MRI, neurocognitive assessment and historical phenylalanine (Phe) levels were collected. A hypothesis-generating case study comparing diet-compliant and non-compliant siblings confirmed that DKI metrics are sensitive to dietary adherence and prompted a candidate metric (K<sub>rad</sub>/K<sub>FA</sub> ratio). We then tested this metric in a Replication cohort (PKU = 20; controls = 43). Both siblings scored outside the range of controls for all DKI-based metrics, with severe changes in the periventricular white matter and a gradient of severity toward the cortex. K<sub>rad</sub>/K<sub>FA</sub> provided clear separation by diagnosis in the Replication cohort (p < 0.001 in periventricular, deep and pericortical compartments). The ratio also correlated negatively with attention (r = -0.51 & -0.50, p < 0.05) and positively with 3-year mean Phe (r = 0.45 & 0.58, p < 0.01). DKI reveals regionally-specific, progressive abnormalities of brain diffusion characteristics in PKU, even in the absence of conspicuous clinical signs or abnormalities on conventional MRI. A DKI-based marker derived from these scores (K<sub>rad</sub>/K<sub>FA</sub> ratio) was sensitive to cognitive impairment and PKU control over the medium term and may provide a meaningful subclinical biomarker of end-organ damage."

    "abstract": "It would be difficult to overestimate the importance of persistent, thoughtful parents and their importance in the development of treatments for their children's rare disorders. Almost a century ago in Norway, observant parents led a brilliant young physician-scientist to his discovery of the underlying cause of their children's profound developmental delay-i.e., phenylketonuria, or PKU. Decades later, in a recovering war-ravaged Britain, an equally persistent mother pressed the scientists at Birmingham Children's Hospital to find a way to treat her seriously damaged daughter, Sheila, who suffered from PKU. Living on the financial edge, this mother insisted that Bickel and colleagues develop such a diet, and she volunteered Sheila to be the patient in the trial. The scientists concluded that the low phenylalanine diet helped but needed to be started very early-so, newborn screening was born to permit the implementation of this. Many steps brought us to where we are today, but these courageous parents made it all begin."

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria is an inherited disease for which the main treatment is the dietary restriction of the amino acid phenylalanine. The diet has to be initiated in the neonatal period to prevent or reduce mental handicap. However, the diet is very restrictive and unpalatable and can be difficult to follow. A deficiency of the amino acid tyrosine has been suggested as a cause of some of the neuropsychological problems exhibited in phenylketonuria. Therefore, this review aims to assess the efficacy of tyrosine supplementation for phenylketonuria. This is an update of previously published versions of this review. To assess the effects of tyrosine supplementation alongside or instead of a phenylalanine-restricted diet for people with phenylketonuria, who commenced on diet at diagnosis and either continued on the diet or relaxed the diet later in life. To assess the evidence that tyrosine supplementation alongside, or instead of a phenylalanine-restricted diet improves intelligence, neuropsychological performance, growth and nutritional status, mortality rate and quality of life. We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Trials Register which is comprised of references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Additional studies were identified from handsearches of the Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (from inception in 1978 to 1998). The manufacturers of prescribable dietary products used in the treatment of phenylketonuria were also contacted for further references. Date of the most recent search of the Group's Inborn Errors of Metabolism Trials Register: 07 December 2020. All randomised or quasi-randomised trials investigating the use of tyrosine supplementation versus placebo in people with phenylketonuria in addition to, or instead of, a phenylalanine-restricted diet. People treated for maternal phenylketonuria were excluded. Two authors independently assessed the trial eligibility, methodological quality and extracted the data. Six trials were found, of which three trials reporting the results of a total of 56 participants, were suitable for inclusion in the review. The blood tyrosine concentrations were significantly higher in the participants receiving tyrosine supplements than those in the placebo group, mean difference 23.46 (95% confidence interval 12.87 to 34.05). No significant differences were found between any of the other outcomes measured. The trials were assessed as having a low to moderate risk of bias across several domains. From the available evidence no recommendations can be made about whether tyrosine supplementation should be introduced into routine clinical practice. Further randomised controlled studies are required to provide more evidence. However, given this is not an active area of research, we have no plans to update this review in the future."

More so, probiotic microbes can be co-opted to deliver therapeutics by oral administration as living drugs, able to survive and safely transit the digestive tract. As living therapeutics are in their nascency, traditional pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) models for evaluating drug candidates are not appropriate for this novel platform. Using a living therapeutic in late-stage clinical development for phenylketonuria (PKU) as a case study, we adapt traditional oral drug delivery models to properly evaluate and inform the engineering of living therapeutics. We develop the adapted for living therapeutics compartmental absorption and transit (ALT-CAT) model to provide metrics for drug efficacy across nine age groups of PKU patients and evaluate model parameters that are influenced by patient physiology, microbe selection and therapeutic production, and dosing formulations. In particular, the ALT-CAT model describes the mathematical framework to model the behavior of orally delivered engineered bacteria that act as living therapeutics by adapting similar methods that have been developed and widely-used for small molecular drug delivery and absorption."

Guidelines are required on the proper use of sapropterin hydrochloride for tetrahydrobiopterin-responsive hyperphenylalaninemia. It is recommended that tetrahydrobiopterin-responsive hyperphenylalaninemia should be diagnosed in all cases of hyperphenylalaninemia, including phenylketonuria, by tetrahydrobiopterin administration tests rather than by phenotype or blood phenylalanine levels.

The frequency patients would want to visit a CE, when not treated in a CE (n = 83) varied: every hospital visit (24%, n = 20), annual or bi-annual (45%, n = 37), at defined patient ages (6%, n = 5), one visit only (22%, n = 18), or never (4%, n = 3). Distance was reported as a major barrier (42%, n = 35). 78% (n = 65) expected CE physicians and dieticians to have a higher level of knowledge than in non-CE centres. For participants already treated in a CE (n = 68), 66% requested a more extensive annual or bi-annual review. In general, psychology review and neuropsychologist assessment were identified as necessary by approximately half of the 105 participants. In addition, 66% (n = 68) expected a strong collaboration with patient associations. In this small study, most participants expected that assigning CEs will change the structure of and delivery of Phenylketonuria care."

Study revealed that the most common Georgian PAH mutations spectrum differs from the European one. 9 out of 18 detected mutations coincide with the European panel. At the same time more than half (55%) of the mutations found in Georgians were not identified as the most common mutations in Europe. These findings may indicate the necessity for the development of diagnostic panels specific to the Georgian population, including both 9 frequent European PAH mutations and 9 mutations more common for the Georgian population, which will significantly improve the quality of PKU diagnostics in Georgia. The results have been obtained are of an intermediate nature, which propose to continue and complete this research by studying the entire Georgian PKU population."

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is the most common inborn error of amino acid metabolism and causes neurological manifestations because of excessive accumulation of phenylalanine (PHE). It can also affect adult patients who discontinue their treatment, even if they had been under adequate metabolic control during childhood. For that reason, it is recommended that PKU treatment should be continued throughout life and target PHE levels for adult patients should range between 120 and 600 μmol/L. The authors present an adult patient with PKU who discontinued treatment and developed cognitive dysfunction because of high blood levels of PHE. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the patient was characteristic for PKU, presenting periventricular and callosal white matter hyperintensities in T2 and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequences, which were additionally associated with true restriction in diffusion-weighted imaging sequence, a far less recognized PKU neuroimaging feature. Cognitive dysfunction and psychiatric disorders can be present in adult patients with PKU who discontinue treatment and have poor PHE metabolic control. The presence of white matter hyperintensities in T2 and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery MRI-sequences is a well-described neuroimaging feature of PKU, but diffusion-weighted imaging sequence may also be reliable in detecting brain lesions in patients with PKU. PKU lesions should be considered in the differential diagnosis of true diffusion restriction in brain MRI of patients with PKU history or those who might have escaped newborn screening diagnosis but present neurocognitive dysfunction. Appropriate treatment for the management of PKU should be initiated for the reversal of the clinical and neuroimaging findings."

Thirty-four Brazilian patients with a biochemical diagnosis of PKU, from 33 unrelated families, were analyzed through next-generation sequencing in the Ion Torrent PGM™ platform. Phenotype-genotype correlations were made based on the BioPKU database. Three patients required additional Sanger sequencing analyses. Twenty-six different pathogenic variants were identified. The most frequent variants were c.1315+1G>A (<i>n</i> = 8/66), c.473G>A (<i>n</i> = 6/66), and c.1162G>A (<i>n</i> = 6/66). One novel variant, c.524C>G (p.Pro175Arg), was found in one allele and was predicted as likely pathogenic by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) criteria. The molecular modeling of p.Pro175Arg indicated that this substitution can affect monomers binding in the PAH tetramer, which could lead to a change in the stability and activity of this enzyme. Next-generation sequencing was a fast and effective method for diagnosing PKU and is useful for patient phenotype prediction and genetic counseling."

The aim of this study was to describe our experience and evaluate the screening positive cases in a period of 9 years (2011-2019). During the period of the study, a total of 592.822 neonates were screened with this expanded program by MS/MS in the Community of Madrid. Amino acids, acylcarnitines, and succinylacetone were quantified in all samples that met the quality criteria. Means, medians, percentiles and standard deviation of the analytes and ratios of interest were calculated. 901 patients (0,15 %) with a positive screening test were referred to clinical evaluation. 230 patients were diagnosed of 30 different inborn errors of metabolism (prevalence 1:2577), 11 of which were not included as a target in the Community of Madrid newborn screening program. The global positive predictive value was 25,6 %. During this period of time, two false negative cases were detected. The most prevalent disorders were phenylketonuria/hyperphenylalaninemia and medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (1:6444 and 1:13174 respectively). 93 % of the patients were detected in the presymptomatic stage. During the last 9 years a large number of cases of IEM have been detected with an acceptable global positive predictive value.

Some IEMs can be effectively treated by dietary restrictions (e.g., phenylketonuria (PKU), maple syrup urine disease (MSUD)), and/or dietary intervention to remove offending compounds (e.g., acylcarnitine excretion with the oral intake of l-carnitine in the disorders of fatty acid oxidation). While the IEMs are predominantly monogenic disorders, their phenotypic presentation is complex and pleiotropic, impacting multiple physiological systems (hepatic and neurological function, renal and musculoskeletal impairment, cardiovascular and pulmonary activity, etc.). The metabolic dysfunction induced by the IEMs, as well as the dietary interventions used to treat them, are predicted to impact the gut microbiome in patients, and it is highly likely that microbiome dysbiosis leads to further exacerbation of the clinical phenotype. That said, only recently has the gut microbiome been considered as a potential pathomechanistic consideration in the IEMs. In this review, we overview the function of the gut-brain axis, the crosstalk between these compartments, and the expanding reports of dysbiosis in the IEMs recently reported. The potential use of pre- and probiotics to improve clinical outcomes in IEMs is also highlighted."

Loss-of-function of PAH leads to accumulation of phenylalanine in the blood/body of an untreated patient, which damages the developing brain, causing severe mental retardation. Current gene therapy strategies based on adeno-associated vector (AAV) delivery of PAH gene were effective in male animals but had little long-term effects on blood hyperphenylalaninemia in females. Here, we designed a gene therapy strategy using AAV to deliver a human codon-optimized phenylalanine amino lyase in a liver-specific manner. It was shown that PAL was active in lysing phenylalanine when it was expressed in mammalian cells. We produced a recombinant adeno-associated vector serotype 8 (AAV8) viral vector expressing the humanized PAL under the control of human antitrypsin (hAAT) promoter (AAV8-PAL). A single intravenous administration of AAV8-PAL caused long-term correction of hyperphenylalaninemia in both male and female PKU mice (strain Pah<sup>enu2</sup>). Besides, no obvious liver injury was observed throughout the treatment process. Thus, our results established that AAV-mediated liver delivery of PAL gene is a promising strategy in the treatment of PKU."

The present study utilizes a new analysis approach called Automated Fiber-Tract Quantification (AFQ) to advance our understanding of the tract-specific patterns of change in WM abnormalities in individuals with early-treated PKU (ETPKU). Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) data from a sample of 22 individuals with ETPKU and a demographically-matched sample of 21 healthy individuals without PKU was analyzed using AFQ. In addition, a subsample of 8 individuals with ETPKU was reevaluated six months later after demonstrating a significant reduction in blood phe levels following initiation of sapropterin treatment. Within-tract AFQ analyses revealed significant location-by-group interactions for several WM tracts throughout the brain. In most cases, ETPKU-related disruptions in mean diffusivity (MD) were more apparent in posterior (as compared to anterior) aspects of a given tract. Reduction in blood phe levels with the aforementioned ETPKU subsample was associated with a similar pattern of improvement (posterior-to-anterior) within most tracts. Taken together, these findings suggest that there is a systematic pattern of change in WM abnormalities in individuals with ETPKU in a posterior-to-anterior manner along individual WM tracts."

It was promoted by Dr. Juan Sabater Tobella and supported by Barcelona Provincial Council and Juan March Foundation. That is how the Institute of Clinical Biochemistry was born, whose aims were diagnosis, research and teaching, along with the spirit of contributing to the prevention of mental retardation. The CNSP began with the detection of phenylketonuria (PKU), and, in 1982, the Program was expanded with the inclusion of congenital hypothyroidism detection. Towards 1990, the Program covered almost 100% of all newborns (NB) in Catalonia. In 1999, the CNSP was expanded with the incorporation of cystic fibrosis. It took fourteen years, until 2013, to make the largest expansion so far, with the incorporation of 19 metabolic diseases to the screening panel. The detection of sickle cell disease began in 2015 and in 2017 the detection of severe combined immunodeficiency was included. Currently, the CNSP includes 24 diseases in its main panel. Since 1969, 2,787,807 NBs have been screened, of whom 1,724 have been diagnosed with any of these diseases, and 252 of other disorders by differential diagnosis with those included in the main panel. The global prevalence is 1: 1,617 NBs affected by any of the diseases included in the CNSP and 1: 1,140 NBs if incidental findings diagnosed through the CNSP are included."

This paper describes how a simple and effective organization, which incorporates all the fundamental actors under the responsibility of the Public Health Directorate (DSP), has managed to ensure that the PCN of the Basque Country meets all the objectives required for a population screening. The acceptance by Basque society of the PCN allowed it to exceed 95% coverage in its second year of operation. Likewise, the limited negative social impact of PCN is evidenced by its low number of false positives and incorrect samples. Excellent response times allow every newborn with a positive result to have an early diagnosis and optimal initiation of treatment. There are two relevant experiences that support the importance of the effective exercise of the responsibility of the DSP. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) was incorporated into the PCN in 1991 meeting all technical and clinical criteria. At the request of the experts, the DSP ordered in 1993 to cease this activity showing that it did not provide the expected benefits. The problems of organically integrating the PCN into the healthcare system were also experienced. The need to compete for resources put public health activities, including the PCN, at risk and led to their return to direct dependence on the DSP. The availability of this structure, in addition to facilitating the incorporation of other screenings, allows facing the future challenges."

Sixty-six cases of false positives were identified (seventeen of them in relation to maternal pathology) and five false negatives, being the overall PPV and NPV of the program respectively of 89.2% and 99.99%, with a sensitivity of 99.09% and a specificity of 99.98%. The mortality rate of diagnosed CME patients is 1.52%, with eleven cases presenting symptoms prior to the screening result (2%). The intelligence quotient of IEM patients at risk of neurological involvement is normal in more than 95% of cases."

    "title": "Dietary protein and protein substitute requirements in adults with phenylketonuria: A review of the clinical guidelines.",
    "abstract": "Lifelong dietary treatment is recommended in the management of phenylketonuria (PKU). Accordingly, an increasing adult population require age-specific PKU guidelines on protein requirements to support changing metabolic demands across the lifespan. Given that protein intake for dietary management of PKU is primarily (52-80%) derived from protein substitutes, the prescribing practice of protein substitutes must be underpinned by robust evidence. Whilst dietary guidelines for PKU management is evolving to incorporate adult specific protein recommendations, the scientific evidence underpinning these guidelines is currently limited. Instead, the determination of protein requirements for people with PKU have previously been extrapolated from estimates derived from the general healthy population, based on arguably outdated nitrogen balance methodology. Furthermore, a compensatory factor of 20-40% has been incorporated to account for the reduced uptake and utilisation of the elemental amino acids contained in protein substitutes. However, research informing this compensatory factor has been conducted in younger adults, with the majority of studies in non-PKU individuals. Given extensive evidence that the muscle anabolic response to ingested protein is impaired in older vs. young adults, the validity of current dietary protein recommendations for adults and older adults with PKU has been challenged. This narrative review aims to critically evaluate the existing scientific evidence underpinning current guidelines on protein requirements for adults with PKU, highlighting existing gaps in knowledge and directions for future research. We argue that current guidelines on protein requirements need updating to optimise long-term physical and functional outcomes in older adults with PKU."

    "abstract": "Families of children with phenylketonuria (PKU) report child emotional and behavioral problems, parenting stress, and parenting difficulties, which are associated with worse health-related quality of life. This study aimed to examine acceptability and feasibility of a brief, group-based parenting program (Healthy Living Triple P) for families of children with PKU. An uncontrolled nonrandomized trial design was used. Families of children aged 2-12 years (N = 17) completed questionnaire measures assessing child behavior and impact of PKU on quality of life (primary outcomes), and parenting behavior, self-efficacy and stress, and children's behavioral and emotional adjustment (secondary outcomes). Routinely collected blood phenylalanine (Phe) levels were obtained from the treating team. Parents selected two child behaviors as targets for change. The intervention comprised two, 2-hr group sessions delivered face-to-face or online. Assessment was repeated at 4-week postintervention (T2) and 4-month follow-up (T3). Attrition was low and parent satisfaction with the intervention (face-to-face and online) was high. All families achieved success with one or both child behavior goals, and 75% of families achieved 100% success with both behavior goals by T3; however, there was no change in health-related quality of life. There were moderate improvements in parent-reported ineffective parenting (total score, d = 0.87, 95% CI -1.01 to 2.75) and laxness (d = 0.59, 95% CI -1.27 to 2.46), but no effects on parenting stress or children's adjustment. Phe levels improved by 6month post-intervention for children with elevated preintervention levels. Results support intervention acceptability and feasibility. A randomized controlled trial is warranted to establish intervention efficacy."

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder caused by the dysfunction of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH). Alterations in the level of PAH leads to the toxic accumulation of phenylalanine in the blood and brain. Protein degradation mediated by ubiquitination is a principal cellular process for maintaining protein homeostasis. Therefore, it is important to identify the E3 ligases responsible for PAH turnover and proteostasis. Here, we report that anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome-Cdh1 (APC/C)<sup>Cdh1</sup> is an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that interacts and promotes the polyubiquitination of PAH through the 26S proteasomal pathway. Cdh1 destabilizes and declines the half-life of PAH. In contrast, the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of <i>Cdh1</i> stabilizes PAH expression and enhances phenylalanine metabolism. Additionally, our current study demonstrates the clinical relevance of PAH and Cdh1 correlation in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Overall, we show that PAH is a prognostic marker for HCC and Cdh1 could be a potential therapeutic target to regulate PAH-mediated physiological and metabolic disorders."

However, if their mother had not been so persistent in her search for somebody who could give her a reason why both her children were retarded, Asbjørn Følling's name might never have been associated with PKU and surely the history of PKU would have started differently. In the short review below, the authors give a partly personal and therefore rare account of the early history of PKU, its treatment and the start of neonatal screening.

It can have variable clinical severity and there is limited information on the clinical presentation, natural history and effectiveness of newborn screening for this condition. Retrospective data (growth and clinical parameters, biochemical and genetic testing results, treatment) were collected from 19 patients with PTPS deficiency in different centers, to evaluate biochemical and clinical outcomes. Descriptive statistics was used for qualitative variables, while linear regression analysis was used to correlate quantitative variables. Patients with PTPS deficiency had an increased incidence of prematurity (4/18) with an average gestational age only mildly reduced (37.8 ± 2.4 weeks) and low birth weight (-1.14 ± 0.97 SD below that predicted for gestational age). With time, weight and height approached normal. All patients were identified by newborn screening for an elevated phenylalanine level. However, phenylalanine levels were normal in two whose testing was performed at or before 24 h of age. Sapropterin dihydrochloride treatment normalized phenylalanine levels. Molecular testing identified novel variants in the PTS gene, some of which present in more than one affected family. The neurotransmitter derivatives 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5HIAA) and homovanillic acid (HVA) in the CSF were decreased in most cases except in 2 families with the peripheral form of PTPS deficiency. With time, HVA and 5HIAA became abnormally low in two of these patients requiring therapy. Prolactin (whose secretion is inhibited by dopamine) levels were elevated in several patients with PTPS deficiency and inversely correlated with the z-scores for height (p < 0.01) and weight (p < 0.05). Most patients with PTPS deficiency had delayed development early in life, improving around school age with IQs mostly in the normal range, with a small decline in older individuals. From a neurological standpoint, most patients had normal brain MRI and minor EEG anomalies, although some had persistent neurological symptoms. Patients with PTPS deficiency have not only an increased incidence of prematurity, but also decreased birth weight when corrected for gestational age. Hyperphenylalaninemia can be absent in the first day of life. Therapy with sapropterin dihydrochloride normalizes phenylalanine levels and neurotransmitter precursors can improve CSF neurotransmitter metabolites levels. Insufficient dopaminergic stimulation (as seen from elevated prolactin) might result in decreased height in patients with PTPS deficiency. Despite early delays in development, many patients can achieve independence in adult life, with usually normal neuroimaging and EEG."

PKU is the commonest congenital inborn error of metabolism. The aim of our study was to investigate the characteristics of clinical practice in relation to PKU in Italy, in order to raise awareness about the current management and therapeutic approaches adopted. Six Italian experts conducted a systematic literature review as well as an internal survey to investigate the relevant clinical aspects. Collectively, the expert panel managed a total of 678 PKU patients treated in the early stages of the condition over a 16-year period across six centers. The management of PKU varied markedly between centers, with differences in the composition of the multidisciplinary team, dietary treatments, compliance and adherence to management, tetrahydrobiopterin use, and patient follow-up. Patients were mostly managed by a pediatric reference center from the initial PKU diagnosis during newborn screening until adulthood, without transition to a specialized adult clinician. Fogginess, concentration reduction, low attention, anxiety, irritability, memory deficit, headache, and unstable mood were common features in patients with uncontrolled blood phenylalanine levels (generally above 600 µmol/L). A homogeneous and shared approach to the management of PKU patients is important. Our survey demonstrates the current management of PKU in Italy, with the aim of promoting the implementation of therapeutic strategies and follow-up, increased patient compliance and adherence, and the achievement of the phenylalanine level targets recommended by European Union guidelines. Emerging therapies are likely to become a standard treatment for patients unable to comply with diet therapy and maintain their phenylalanine levels below the threshold values.

    "abstract": "Phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) is an allosteric enzyme that maintains phenylalanine (Phe) below neurotoxic levels; its failure results in phenylketonuria, an inborn error of amino acid metabolism. Wild type (WT) PAH equilibrates among resting-state (RS-PAH) and activated (A-PAH) conformations, whose equilibrium position depends upon allosteric Phe binding. The RS-PAH conformation of WT rat PAH (rPAH) contains a cation-π sandwich involving Phe80 that cannot exist in the A-PAH conformation. Phe80 variants F80A, F80D, F80L, and F80R were prepared and evaluated using native PAGE, size exclusion chromatography, ion exchange behavior, intrinsic protein fluorescence, enzyme kinetics, and limited proteolysis, each as a function of [Phe]. Like WT rPAH, F80A and F80D show allosteric activation by Phe while F80L and F80R are constitutively active. Maximal activity of all variants suggests relief of a rate-determining conformational change. Limited proteolysis of WT rPAH (minus Phe) reveals facile cleavage within a 4-helix bundle that is buried in the RS-PAH tetramer interface, reflecting dynamic dissociation of that tetramer. This cleavage is not seen for the Phe80 variants, which all show proteolytic hypersensitivity in a linker that repositions during the RS-PAH to A-PAH interchange. Hypersensitivity is corrected by addition of Phe such that all variants become like WT rPAH and achieve the A-PAH conformation. Thus, manipulation of Phe80 perturbs the conformational space sampled by PAH, increasing sampling of on-pathway intermediates in the RS-PAH and A-PAH interchange. The behavior of the Phe80 variants mimics that of disease-associated R68S and suggests a molecular basis for proteolytic susceptibility in PKU-associated human PAH variants."

Retrospective descriptive study of 24 months on patients diagnosed with inborn errors of metabolism during childhood and who attended the pharmacy clinic or Day-Care Unit of a 630-bed general hospital. The study included 15 patients with a median age of 17.8 years and were treated with nine different drugs: sapropterin, sodium phenylbutyrate, miglustat, velaglucerase, sebelipase, idursulfase, 5-hydroxytryptophan, succinate, and riboflavin. Nine different inborn errors of metabolism were observed: phenylketonuria, defects of the urea cycle, Gaucher, Nieman-Pick, Hunter's disease, along with acid lipase deficiency, and mitochondrial diseases. Orphan drugs used for the treatment of inborn errors of metabolism accounted for 1.3% of hospital drug costs. Some orphan drugs achieved asymptomatic patients, but others just produced a modest symptomatic improvement. Most patients showed good tolerance to the treatment. Orphan drugs used in inborn errors of metabolism had an easy to manage toxicity profile, with many disparities in effectiveness. These drugs have a high economic impact. The cost-effectiveness ratio for orphan drugs is a controversial issue due to their high cost and the inconclusive clinical evidence."

    "abstract": "The composition and functioning of the gut microbiota, the complex population of microorganisms residing in the intestine, is strongly affected by endogenous and exogenous factors, among which diet is key. Important perturbations of the microbiota have been observed to contribute to disease risk, as in the case of neurological disorders, inflammatory bowel disease, obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, among others. Although mechanisms are not fully clarified, nutrients interacting with the microbiota are thought to affect host metabolism, immune response or disrupt the protective functions of the intestinal barrier. Similarly, key intermediaries, whose presence may be strongly influenced by dietary habits, sustain the communication along the gut-brain-axis, influencing brain functions in the same way as the brain influences gut activity. Due to the role of diet in the modulation of the microbiota, its composition is of high interest in inherited errors of metabolism (IEMs) and may reveal an appealing therapeutic target. In IEMs, for example in phenylketonuria (PKU), since part of the therapeutic intervention is based on chronic or life-long tailored dietetic regimens, important variations of the microbial diversity or relative abundance have been observed. A holistic approach, including a healthy composition of the microbiota, is recommended to modulate host metabolism and affected neurological functions."

Synthesis conditions of the PAL@NF on the formation of the PAL@NF were optimized. The PAL@NF exhibited 90% activity recovery under optimal condition. Compared with free PAL, the PAL@NF displayed good storage stability and increased tolerance to proteolysis. After five consecutive operating cycles, the PAL@NF still retained 73% of its initial activity, indicating excellent reusability. Furthermore, the paper-based biosensor was able to detect Phe concentration in urine samples, and exhibited good linearity to the Phe concentrations in the range from 60 to 2400 μM and the response time was only about 10 min.

Between 1 March 2012 and 29 February 2020, 461,369 newborns were screened for 20 IEMs in addition to phenylketonuria (PKU). Excluding PKU, there were 75 true-positive (TP) (1:6151) and 107 (1:4311) false-positive IEM cases. Twenty-one percent of the TP cases were symptomatic at the time of the NBS results, but in two-thirds, the screening result directed the exact diagnosis. Eighty-two percent of the TP cases had good health outcomes, evaluated in 2020. The yearly positive predictive value was increased from 26% to 54% by the use of the Region 4 Stork post-analytical interpretive tool (R4S)/Collaborative Laboratory Integrated Reports 2.0 (CLIR), second-tier biochemical testing and genetic confirmation using DNA extracted from the original dried blood spots. The incidence of IEMs increased by 46% after eNBS was introduced, predominantly due to the finding of attenuated phenotypes. The next step is defining which newborns would truly benefit from screening at the milder end of the disease spectrum. This will require coordinated international collaboration, including proper case definitions and outcome studies."

This report describes the methodology used in its development including review, critical appraisal and abstraction of peer-reviewed studies and unpublished practice literature; expert input through two Delphi surveys and a nominal group process; and external review from metabolic physicians and dietitians. It includes the summary statements of the nutrition management recommendations for each research question, followed by a standardized rating based on the strength of the evidence. Online, open access of the full published guideline allows utilization by health care providers, researchers and collaborators who advise, advocate and care for individuals with VLCAD and their families and can be accessed from the Genetic Metabolic Dietitians International (https://GMDI.org) and Southeast Regional Genetics Network (https://southeastgenetics.org/ngp) websites."

    "title": "Biomimetic Recognition and Optical Sensing of Carboxylic Acids in Water by Using a Buried Salt Bridge and the Hydrophobic Effect.",
    "abstract": "Buried salt bridges widely exist in protein structures but are rarely used in synthetic systems for molecular recognition in water. By mimicking the binding pocket of bioreceptors, we designed and synthesized a pair of endo-functionalized macrocyclic hosts with secondary ammonium groups in a hydrophobic cavity. We found that these macrocycles are able to selectively recognize carboxylic acids in water through salt bridges and the hydrophobic effect. Moreover, it was demonstrated that these macrocyclic receptors can be used in circular-dichroism-based optical chirality sensing of chiral carboxylic acids and fluorescent sensing of phenylpyruvic acid-a biomarker for phenylketonuria. This research showcases that buried salt bridges can be effectively used by endo-functionalized macrocyclic hosts for molecular recognition in water, where solvent screening on polar noncovalent interactions is high."

    "title": "Minimal Change Disease and Phenylketonuria in an Adult Patient: The Two Sides of Protein Homeostasis.",
    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU), the most common inborn error of amino acid metabolism, has been associated with an increased risk of renal impairment, the reason for which is not fully understood. We report the case of a 33-year-old female patient diagnosed with PKU in adulthood after suspicion of the disease in her daughter. The diagnostic approach revealed proteinuria, and minimal change disease (MCD) was identified. Therapeutic measures and follow-up are discussed. The possible link between these two disorders is interesting. Attenuated developmental delay of untreated PKU could be explained by the decreased accumulation of phenylalanine secondary to proteinuria. On the other hand, MCD may be a possible, although as yet unreported, pathophysiological mechanism explaining the renal repercussions that have been found in adult PKU patients, who should be screened for proteinuria. Phenylketonuria (PKU) is associated with renal impairment so patients with PKU should be periodically screened for proteinuria because podocytopathies, such as minimal change disease (MCD), may be an underlying misdiagnosed condition.MCD in adults demands tight surveillance in case of severe complications including nephrotic syndrome, haematuria and acute kidney injury, and although remission with glucocorticoid therapy is typical, 50-75% of patients will relapse.MCD may be a previously unreported cause of proteinuria and renal involvement in adult patients with PKU, where control of hypertension and moderation of protein overload are essential."

    "title": "A 3 Year Longitudinal Prospective Review Examining the Dietary Profile and Contribution Made by Special Low Protein Foods to Energy and Macronutrient Intake in Children with Phenylketonuria.",
    "abstract": "The nutritional composition of special low protein foods (SLPFs) is controlled under EU legislation for 'Foods for Special Medical Purposes (FSMP)'. They are designed to meet the energy needs of patients unable to eat a normal protein containing diet. In phenylketonuria (PKU), the macronutrient contribution of SLPFs has been inadequately examined. A 3-year longitudinal prospective study investigating the contribution of SLPFs to the macronutrient intake of children with early treated PKU. 48 children (27 boys) with a mean recruitment age of 9.3 y were studied. Semi-quantitative dietary assessments and food frequency questionnaires (FFQ) were collected three to four times/year for 3 years. The mean energy intake provided by SLPFs was 33% (SD ± 8), and this figure was 42% (SD ± 13) for normal food and 21% (SD ± 5) for protein substitutes (PS). SLPFs supplied a mean intake of 40% carbohydrate (SD ± 10), 51% starch (SD ± 18), 21% sugar (SD ± 8), and 38% fat (SD ± 13). Fibre intake met 83% of the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN) reference value, with 50% coming from SLPFs with added gums and hydrocolloids. Low protein bread, pasta and milk provided the highest energy contribution, and the intake of sweet SLPFs (e.g., biscuits, cakes, and chocolate) was minimal. Children averaged three portions fruit/vegetable daily, and children aged ≥ 12 y had irregular meal patterns. SLPFs provide essential energy in phenylalanine restricted diets. Optimising the nutritional quality of SLPFs deserves more attention."

    "title": "Neonatal and carrier screening for rare diseases: how innovation challenges screening criteria worldwide.",
    "abstract": "Screening for rare diseases first began more than 50 years ago with neonatal bloodspot screening (NBS) for phenylketonuria, and carrier screening for Tay-Sachs disease, sickle cell anaemia and β-thalassaemia. NBS's primary aim is health gain for children, while carrier screening enables autonomous reproductive choice. While screening can be beneficial, it also has the potential to cause harm and thus decisions are needed on whether a specific screening is worthwhile. These decisions are usually based on screening principles and criteria. Technological developments, both treatment driven and test driven, have led to expansions in neonatal screening and carrier screening. This article demonstrates how the dynamics and expansions in NBS and carrier screening have challenged four well-known screening criteria (treatment, test, target population and programme evaluation), and the decision-making based on them. We show that shifting perspectives on screening criteria for NBS as well as carrier screening lead to converging debates in these separate fields. For example, the child is traditionally considered to be the beneficiary in NBS, but the family and society can also benefit. Vice versa, carrier screening may be driven by disease prevention, rather than reproductive autonomy, raising cross-disciplinary questions regarding potential beneficiaries and which diseases to include. In addition, the stakeholders from these separate fields vary: Globally NBS is often governed as a public health programme while carrier screening is usually available via medical professionals. The article concludes with a call for an exchange of vision and knowledge among all stakeholders of both fields to attune the dynamics of screening."

    "title": "Use of Dried Blood Spot Specimens to Monitor Patients with Inherited Metabolic Disorders.",
    "abstract": "Monitoring of patients with inherited metabolic disorders (IMDs) using dried blood spot (DBS) specimens has been routinely used since the inception of newborn screening (NBS) for phenylketonuria in the 1960s. The introduction of flow injection analysis tandem mass spectrometry (FIA-MS/MS) in the 1990s facilitated the expansion of NBS for IMDs. This has led to increased identification of patients who require biochemical monitoring. Monitoring of IMD patients using DBS specimens is widely favoured due to the convenience of collecting blood from a finger prick onto filter paper devices in the patient's home, which can then be mailed directly to the laboratory. Ideally, analytical methodologies with a short analysis time and high sample throughput are required to enable results to be communicated to patients in a timely manner, allowing prompt therapy adjustment. The development of ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC-MS/MS), means that metabolic laboratories now have the capability to routinely analyse DBS specimens with superior specificity and sensitivity. This advancement in analytical technology has led to the development of numerous assays to detect analytes at low concentrations (pmol/L) in DBS specimens that can be used to monitor IMD patients. In this review, we discuss the pre-analytical, analytical and post-analytical variables that may affect the final test result obtained using DBS specimens used for monitoring of patients with an IMD."

    "title": "Post-Analytical Tools for the Triage of Newborn Screening Results in Follow-up Can Reduce Confirmatory Testing and Guide Performance Improvement.",
    "abstract": "Georgia uses post-analytical tools through Collaborative Laboratory Integrated Reports (CLIR) to triage abnormal newborn screening (NBS) results for follow-up. Condition specific tools are used to assign each case a risk level, which is used to guide follow-up recommendations. Follow-up recommendations include assessment by the child's primary care provider as well as testing, either a repeat NBS or confirmatory testing. Triaging abnormal cases using these tools has been advantageous in managing the workflow for the follow-up team, as well as prioritizing cases that appropriately require more attention and resources. The initial goal in utilizing these tools was to reduce the amount of confirmatory testing, particularly for disorders where there are many false positives. We assessed the performance of these tools retrospectively for three of the most commonly detected conditions by tandem mass spectrometry in Georgia: phenylketonuria, medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency and very long chain dehydrogenase deficiency. The post-analytical tools appropriately assigned all true positive cases to the higher levels of follow-up testing and reduced the level of intervention for a significant number of cases as well. Based on the experience gained from our utilization of the tools in the follow-up program, we are well situated to move forward with using the tools in a more prospective manner, and reduce the number of cases that will be reported, rather than just assigning resources appropriately at follow-up. Post-analytical tools are an improvement over trying to capture the variation in the newborn population using multiple cutoffs. It also easily identifies significant abnormalities that are unrelated to inherited disease, such as large amino acid elevations due to total parenteral nutrition."

    "abstract": "Phenylalanine hydroxylase-deficient (PAH-deficient) phenylketonuria (PKU) results in systemic hyperphenylalaninemia, leading to neurotoxicity with severe developmental disabilities. Dietary phenylalanine (Phe) restriction prevents the most deleterious effects of hyperphenylalaninemia, but adherence to diet is poor in adult and adolescent patients, resulting in characteristic neurobehavioral phenotypes. Thus, an urgent need exists for new treatments. Additionally, rodent models of PKU do not adequately reflect neurocognitive phenotypes, and thus there is a need for improved animal models. To this end, we have developed PAH-null pigs. After selection of optimal CRISPR/Cas9 genome-editing reagents by using an in vitro cell model, zygote injection of 2 sgRNAs and Cas9 mRNA demonstrated deletions in preimplantation embryos, with embryo transfer to a surrogate leading to 2 founder animals. One pig was heterozygous for a PAH exon 6 deletion allele, while the other was compound heterozygous for deletions of exon 6 and of exons 6-7. The affected pig exhibited hyperphenylalaninemia (2000-5000 μM) that was treatable by dietary Phe restriction, consistent with classical PKU, along with juvenile growth retardation, hypopigmentation, ventriculomegaly, and decreased brain gray matter volume. In conclusion, we have established a large-animal preclinical model of PKU to investigate pathophysiology and to assess new therapeutic interventions."

    "abstract": "Although extended newborn screening (NBS) programs have been introduced more than 20 years ago, their impact on the long-term clinical outcome of individuals with inherited metabolic diseases (IMDs) is still rarely investigated. We studied the clinical outcomes of individuals with IMDs identified by NBS between 1999 and 2016 in a prospective multicenter observational study. In total, 306 screened individuals with IMDs (115 with phenylketonuria and 191 with other IMDs with a lifelong risk for metabolic decompensation) were followed for a median time of 6.2 years. Although the risk for metabolic decompensation was disease-specific and NBS could not prevent decompensations in every individual at risk (<i>n</i> = 49), the majority did not develop permanent disease-specific signs (75.9%), showed normal development (95.6%) and normal cognitive outcome (87.7%; mean IQ: 100.4), and mostly attended regular kindergarten (95.2%) and primary school (95.2%). This demonstrates that not only individuals with phenylketonuria, serving as a benchmark, but also those with lifelong risk for metabolic decompensation had a favorable long-term outcome. High NBS process quality is the prerequisite of this favorable outcome. This is supported by 28 individuals presenting with first symptoms at a median age of 3.5 days before NBS results were available, by the absence of neonatal decompensations after the report of NBS results, and by the challenge of keeping relevant process parameters at a constantly high level. NBS for IMDs, although not completely preventing clinical presentations in all individuals, can be considered a highly successful program of secondary prevention."

    "abstract": "Phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) deficiency, colloquially known as phenylketonuria (PKU), is among the most common inborn errors of metabolism and in the past decade has become a target for the development of novel therapeutics such as gene therapy. PAH deficient mouse models have been key to new treatment development, but all prior existing models natively express liver PAH polypeptide as inactive or partially active PAH monomers, which complicates the experimental assessment of protein expression following therapeutic gene, mRNA, protein, or cell transfer. The mutant PAH monomers are able to form hetero-tetramers with and inhibit the overall holoenzyme activity of wild type PAH monomers produced from a therapeutic vector. Preclinical therapeutic studies would benefit from a PKU model that completely lacks both PAH activity and protein expression in liver. In this study, we employed CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing in fertilized mouse embryos to generate a novel mouse model that lacks exon 1 of the Pah gene. Mice that are homozygous for the Pah exon 1 deletion are viable, severely hyperphenylalaninemic, accurately replicate phenotypic features of untreated human classical PKU and lack any detectable liver PAH activity or protein. This model of classical PKU is ideal for further development of gene and cell biologics to treat PKU."

    "abstract": "We aimed to assess if the same cognitive batteries can be used cross-nationally to monitor the effect of Phenylketonuria (PKU). We assessed whether a battery, previously used with English adults with PKU (AwPKU), was also sensitive to impairments in Italian AwPKU. From our original battery, we selected a number of tasks that comprehensively assessed visual attention, visuo-motor coordination, executive functions (particularly, reasoning, planning, and monitoring), sustained attention, and verbal and visual memory and learning. When verbal stimuli/or responses were involved, stimuli were closely matched between the two languages for psycholinguistic variables. We administered the tasks to 19 Italian AwPKU and 19 Italian matched controls and compared results from with 19 English AwPKU and 19 English matched controls selected from a previously tested cohort. Participant election was blind to cognitive performance and metabolic control, but participants were closely matched for age and education. The Italian AwPKU group had slightly worse metabolic control but showed levels of performance and patterns of impairment similar to the English AwPKU group. The Italian results also showed extensive correlations between adult cognitive measures and metabolic measures across the life span, both in terms of Phenylalanine (Phe) levels and Phe fluctuations, replicating previous results in English. These results suggest that batteries with the same and/or matched tasks can be used to assess cognitive outcomes across countries allowing results to be compared and accrued. Future studies should explore potential differences in metabolic control across countries to understand what variables make metabolic control easier to achieve."

This study aimed to assess living situation, dietary practices, and health conditions of early-treated adult PKU patients. A total of 183 early-treated PKU patients ≥18 years from 8 German metabolic centers received access to an online survey, containing 91 questions on sociodemographic data, dietary habits, and health conditions. 144/183 patients (66% females) completed the questionnaire. Compared with German population, the proportion of single-person households was higher (22 vs. 47%), the rate of childbirth was lower (1.34 vs. 0.4%), but educational and professional status did not differ. 82% of the patients adhered to a low-protein diet, 45% consumed modified low-protein food almost daily, and 84% took amino acid mixtures regularly. 48% of the patients never interrupted diet, and 14% stopped diet permanently. 69% of the patients reported to feel better with diet, and 91% considered their quality of life at least as good. The prevalence of depressive symptoms was high (29%) and correlated significantly to phenylalanine blood concentrations (p = 0.046). However, depressive symptoms were only mild in the majority of patients. This group of early-treated adult German PKU patients is socially well integrated, reveals a surprisingly high adherence to diet and amino acid intake, and considers the restrictions of diet to their daily life as low."

    "abstract": "Retinal changes are poorly described in early treated phenylketonuria (ETPKU). We aimed to investigate possible visual functional and ocular microstructural changes in adult patients with ETPKU. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) and its angiography (OCTA) data from patients with PKU were compared to healthy controls. In this prospective, monocentric, cross-sectional, case-control study 50 patients with ETPKU and 50 healthy subjects were evaluated with OCT and OCTA. Measurements were performed on right eyes. The following visual function parameters were studied: best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), spherical equivalent (SE), contrast sensitivity and near stereoacuity; microstructural parameters: retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (RNFLT), ganglion cell layer (GCC) <i>thickness</i>, focal loss of volume (FLV), global loss of volume (GLV), peripapillary, papillary vessel density (VD), ocular axial length (AL) and intraocular pressure (IOP). Among functional tests there were significant differences in contrast sensitivity at 1.5 (<i>p</i> < 0.001), 6 (<i>p</i> < 0.013), 12 (p < 0.001), 18 (<i>p</i> < 0.003) cycles per degree, in near stereoacuity (Titmus Wirt circles, <i>p</i> < 0.001) and in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA, p < 0.001). A statistically significant, moderate positive linear correlation was observed between BCVA and average Phe levels over the last ten years (β = 0.49, <i>p</i> < 0.001). The average (p < 0.001), superior (p < 0.001) inferior GCC (p < 0.001), the FLV (<i>p</i> < 0.003), GLV (p < 0.001) and the average RNFLT (<i>p</i> < 0.004) values of the PKU group were significantly lower than the controls. The serum phenylalanine level (Phe) in the PKU group negatively correlated with inferior (-0.32, <i>p</i> < 0.007), <i>superior (r</i> <i>=</i> <i>-0.26, p</i> <i><</i> <i>0.028)</i> and average (-0.29 <i>p</i> < 0.014) RNFL and with AL (-0.32, <i>p</i> < 0.026). In AL we detected a significant difference (<i>p</i> < 0.04) between the good and suboptimal dietary controlled group. There was no significant difference between the ETPKU and control group in the measured vessel density parameters and in IOP. Our results suggest that functional and ocular microstructural defects are present in patients with PKU, and some of them may depend on dietary control. The mechanism is unclear, but the correlation indicates the importance of strict dietary control in terms of preservation of retinal functions."

    "title": "The effects of early-treated phenylketonuria on volumetric measures of the cerebellum.",
    "abstract": "Past murine studies of phenylketonuria (PKU) have documented significant effects on cerebellum at both the gross and cellular levels. The profile of neurocognitive and motor difficulties associated with early-treated PKU (ETPKU) is also consistent with potential cerebellar involvement. Previous neuroanatomical studies of cerebellum in patients with PKU, however, have yielded mixed results. The objective of the present study was to further examine potential differences in cerebellar morphometry between individuals with and without ETPKU. To this end, we analyzed high resolution T1-weighted MR images from a sample of 20 individuals with ETPKU and an age-matched comparison group of 20 healthy individuals without PKU. Measurements of whole brain volume, whole cerebellum volume, cerebellar gray matter volume, and cerebellar white matter volume were collected by means of semiautomatic volumetric analysis. Data analysis revealed no significant group differences in whole brain volume, whole cerebellar volume, or cerebellar white matter volume. A significant reduction in cerebellar gray matter volume, however, was observed for the ETPKU group compared to the non-PKU comparison group. These findings expand on previous animal work suggesting that cerebellar gray matter is impacted by PKU. It is also consistent with the hypothesis that the cognitive difficulties experienced by individuals with ETPKU may be related to disruptions in gray matter. Additional studies are needed to fully elucidate the timing and extent of the impact of ETPKU on cerebellum and the associated neurocognitive consequences."

    "abstract": "The present study assessed the impact of impaired tetrahydrobiopterin (BH<sub>4</sub>) production on vasoreactivity from conduit and small arteries along the vascular tree as seen during aging. For this purpose, the mutant hyperphenylalaninemic mouse (hph-1) was used. This model is reported to be deficient in GTP cyclohydrolase I, a rate limiting enzyme in BH<sub>4</sub> biosynthesis. BH<sub>4</sub> is a key regulator of vascular homeostasis by regulating the nitric oxide synthase 3 (NOS3) activity. In GTP-CH deficient mice, the aortic BH<sub>4</sub> levels were decreased, by -77% in 12 week-middle-aged mice (young) and by -83% in 35-45 week-middle-aged mice (middle-aged). In young hph-1, the mesenteric artery ability to respond to flow was slightly reduced by 9%. Aging induced huge modification in many vascular functions. In middle-aged hph-1, we observed a decrease in aortic cGMP levels, biomarker of NO availability (-46%), in flow-mediated vasodilation of mesenteric artery (-31%), in coronary hyperemia response measured in isolated heart following transient ischemia (-27%) and in cutaneous microcirculation dilation in response to acetylcholine assessed in vivo by laser-doppler technic (-69%). In parallel, the endothelium-dependent relaxation in response to acetylcholine in conduit blood vessel, measured on isolated aorta rings, was unchanged in hph-1 mice whatever the age. Our findings demonstrate that in middle-aged GTP-CH depleted mice, the reduction of BH<sub>4</sub> was characterized by an alteration of microcirculation dilatory properties observed in various parts of the vascular tree. Large conduit blood vessels vasoreactivity, ie aorta, was unaltered even in middle-aged mice emphasizing the main BH<sub>4</sub>-deletion impact on the microcirculation."

    "abstract": "Individuals with phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) deficiency lack an enzyme needed to metabolize the amino acid, phenylalanine. This leads to an increase of phenylalanine in the blood, which is associated with changes in cognitive and psychological functioning. Skilled clinical management is essential for preventing complications and providing comprehensive care to patients. In the last decade, the American College of Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) and a group of European experts developed separate guidelines to provide recommendations for the management and care of persons with PAH deficiency. The purpose of this paper was to compare and contrast these guidelines in order to understand the different approaches to PAH deficiency care. We examined the procedures used to develop both guidelines, then evaluated key areas in PAH deficiency care which included screening, diagnostic approaches, dietary treatment (initiation and duration), ongoing phenylalanine level/ nutritional monitoring, neurocognitive screening, adherence issues in treatment, and special populations (women and maternal PKU, late or untreated PAH deficiency, and transitioning to adult services). We conducted a scoping review of four key topics in PAH deficiency care to explore recent research studies performed since the publication of the guidelines. The ACMG and European expert group identified limited numbers of high quality studies to use as evidence for their recommendations. The ACMG and European guidelines had many similarities in their respective approaches PAH deficiency care and recommendations for the diagnosis, treatment, and management for persons with PAH deficiency. There were also a number of differences between the guidelines regarding the upper range for phenylalanine levels in adolescents and adults, the types of instruments used and frequency of neuropsychiatric examinations, and monitoring of bone health. Treatment adherence can be associated with a number of challenges, such as aversions to medical foods and formulas, as well as factors related to educational, social, and psychosocial issues. From the scoping review, there were many new studies addressing issues in treatment and management including new research on sapropterin adherence and increased dietary protein tolerance and pegvaliase on the reduction in phenylalanine levels and hypersensitivity reactions. In the last decade, ACMG and European experts developed comprehensive guidelines for the clinical management of phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency. The guidelines offered background and recommendations for clinical care of patients with PAH deficiency throughout the lifespan. New research evidence is available and updates to guidelines can keep pace with new developments. Evidence-based guidelines for diagnosis and treatment are important for providing expert care to patients."

    "abstract": "Genetic screening is an advanced tool for reducing recessive disease burden. Nowadays, it is still unclear as to the number of genes or their variants that are necessary for effective screening. This paper describes the development of a carrier screening custom panel for cystic fibrosis, phenylketonuria, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, and sensorineural hearing loss consisting of 116 variants in the <i>CFTR</i>, <i>PAH</i>, <i>SERPINA1,</i> and <i>GJB2</i> genes. The approach is based on the cheapest and fastest method, on using a small number of genes, and on the estimation of the effectiveness of carriers' detection. The custom panel was tested on a population-based cohort that included 1244 participants. Genotypes were determined by the TaqMan OpenArray Genotyping platform on the QuantStudio 12K Flex Real-Time PCR System. The frequency of heterozygotes in the Russian population was 16.87% or 1:6 (CI95%: 14.76-19.00% by Clopper-Pearson exact method): in <i>CFTR</i>-2.81% (1:36), <i>PAH</i>-2.33% (1:43), <i>SERPINA1</i>-4.90% (1:20), and <i>GJB2</i>-6.83% (1:15).

It is an effective approach to carrier screening for common recessive diseases."

This study aimed to determine Phe tolerance in twin pregnancies. The reviewed cases included three women with PKU who each had a singleton and twin pregnancy (i.e., they were pregnant twice). All patients were under regular supervision to maintain Phe concentrations in a steady state and determine safe Phe intake. Restriction of Phe in the patient's diet was determined depending on the amount of Phe intake, which allowed for stable blood Phe concentrations within the target range. In all three patients with PKU, the ratio of Phe tolerance during the course of the twin and singleton pregnancies was <1 for most of the pregnancy. The ratio of the increase in Phe tolerance between 29 and 34 weeks of gestation and that between 15 and 28 weeks of gestation was 0.66 and 1.17, 0.51 and 0.14, and 0.76 and 1.42 in the twin and singleton pairs of pregnancies, respectively. Our study shows that Phe tolerance in a twin pregnancy is not greater than that in a singleton pregnancy."

    "abstract": "Amyloid polymorphism has emerged as an important topic of research in recent years to identify the particular species responsible for several neurodegenerative disorders, whereas the concept is overlooked in the case of the simplest building block, that is, l-phenylalanine (l-Phe) self-assembly. Here, we report the first evidence of l-Phe polymorphism and the conversion of metastable helical fibrillar to thermodynamically stable rodlike crystalline morphologies with increasing time and temperature. Furthermore, only the fibrillar l-Phe polymorph shows a significant modulation of the model membrane. In addition, the l-Phe molecules prefer to arrange in a multilayered rodlike fashion than in a lateral arrangement, which reduces the membrane binding ability of the l-Phe polymorph due to the decrease in the partial charge of the N-terminal of l-Phe units. The present work exemplifies a different approach to understanding l-Phe self-assembly and provides an effective strategy for the therapy of phenylketonuria by scrutinizing the discrete membrane activity of different l-Phe polymorphs."

A total of 33 patients with HPA and 55 family members were investigated for pterins (neopterin and biopterin) and dihydropteridine reductase (DHPR) activity in dried blood spots. Patients with HPA were genotyped for phenylketonuria (PKU) and the genes involved in tetrahydrobiopterin (BH<sub>4</sub>) metabolism. In total 20 patients were diagnosed with PKU due to phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) deficiency, 2 with GTP cyclohydrolase I (GTPCH) deficiency, 6 with DHPR deficiency, and 3 with the 6-pyruvoyl-tetrahydropterin synthase (PTPS) deficiency. Diagnosis was not possible in 2 patients. This study documents a high percentage of BH<sub>4</sub> deficiencies within HPA patients. With one exception, all patients were homozygous for particular gene variants. This approach enables differentiation between PKU and BH<sub>4</sub> deficiencies and, thus, allows for critical selection of a specific treatment strategies."

    "abstract": "To avoid the risk of intellectual disabilities, newborns in Poland are screened for phenylketonuria and are recommended to start a life-long phenylalanine-restricted diet shortly after birth. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the health care for patients with classical phenylketonuria in Poland. We reviewed the National Health Fund's reporting data concerning information on healthcare services for patients with classical phenylketonuria (PKU), which were reported to the payer by the healthcare service providers between 2009 and 2015. The analysis was prepared within the framework of mapping the health care needs of patients with metabolic diseases published in December 2016 (http://www.mapypotrzebzdrowotnych.mz.gov.pl/). A total of 2706 patients with PKU (including 1180 children) were registered in the healthcare system in the period covered. The estimated national prevalence of PKU was 1 per 7758 live births. Paediatric patients up to 12 moths of age accounted for over 40% of all visits to outpatient clinics. Patients over 28 years of age accounted for only 1% of all PKU patients receiving specialist outpatient care. There were twice as many clinics providing health care to children than to adults. The majority of adult patients received healthcare from the same providers as children. Sixty-nine percent of adults and 64% of children were treated in the two largest outpatient centres. There were 12 deaths, with a median age of 63 years. The working-age adults accounted for 50% of the deaths. Adult patients with PKU do not receive sufficient healthcare. The discontinuation of healthcare by adults with PKU can result from the lack of an adequate transition process from paediatric to adult care."

    "title": "The Impact of the Use of Glycomacropeptide on Satiety and Dietary Intake in Phenylketonuria.",
    "abstract": "Protein is the most satiating macronutrient, increasing secretion of gastrointestinal hormones and diet induced thermogenesis. In phenylketonuria (PKU), natural protein is restricted with approximately 80% of intake supplied by a synthetic protein source, which may alter satiety response. Casein glycomacropeptide (CGMP-AA), a carbohydrate containing peptide and alternative protein substitute to amino acids (AA), may enhance satiety mediated by its bioactive properties. In a three-year longitudinal; prospective study, the effect of AA and two different amounts of CGMP-AA (CGMP-AA only (CGMP100) and a combination of CGMP-AA and AA (CGMP50) on satiety, weight and body mass index (BMI) were compared. 48 children with PKU completed the study. Median ages of children were: CGMP100; (<i>n</i> = 13), 9.2 years; CGMP50; (<i>n</i> = 16), 7.3 years; and AA (<i>n</i> = 19), 11.1 years. Semi-quantitative dietary assessments and anthropometry (weight, height and BMI) were measured every three months. The macronutrient contribution to total energy intake from protein, carbohydrate and fat was similar across the groups. Adjusting for age and gender, no differences in energy intake, weight, BMI, incidence of overweight or obesity was apparent between the groups. In this three-year longitudinal study, there was no indication to support a relationship between CGMP and satiety, as evidenced by decreased energy intake, thereby preventing overweight or obesity. Satiety is a complex multi-system process that is not fully understood."

    "abstract": "Dietary restriction of phenylalanine combined with a protein substitute prevents intellectual disability in patients with phenylketonuria (PKU). However, current protein substitutes are associated with low adherence owing to unpalatability and burdensome administration regimens. This prospective, observational acceptability study in children with PKU assessed the use of a prolonged-release protein substitute designed with an ethyl cellulose and arginate coating masking the bitter taste, smell and reducing the osmolarity of free amino acids. The study product was mixed with the subject's food or drink and replaced ≥1 dose per day of the subject's usual protein substitute for 7 days. Seven of 13 subjects were able to take their prescribed dose over the 7 day period. Most subjects mixed the test protein substitute with food or fruit juice. Reduced blood phenylalanine levels (<i>n</i> = 5) and improved phenylalanine/tyrosine ratio (<i>n</i> = 4) were recorded from baseline to Day 7, respectively. Four subjects reported fewer gastrointestinal symptoms compared to baseline. There were no cases of diarrhoea, constipation, bloating, nausea or vomiting. No adverse reactions were reported. In conclusion, the novel prolonged-release protein substitute was taken in a different way to a typical protein substitute and enabled satisfactory blood phenylalanine control. The study product was well tolerated; subjects experienced fewer gastrointestinal symptoms than with their previous treatment. Although the results of this pilot study provide reassuring data, longer-term studies evaluating adherence and blood phenylalanine control are necessary."

It has a complex phenotype with many variants and genotypes among different populations. Shanxi province is a high-prevalence area of PAHD in China. In this study, eighty-nine PAHD patients were subjected to genetic testing using Sanger sequencing, followed by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification analysis (MLPA). Allelic and genotypic phenotype values (APV and GPV, respectively) were used for genotype-based phenotypic prediction. Fifty-one types of variants, including three novel forms, were identified. The predominant variant was p.R243Q (22.09%), followed by p.R53H (10.47%), p.EX6-96A > G (9.30%), p.V399V (5.23%) and p.R413P (3.49%). Notably, mild hyperphenylalaninemia (MHP) has a high prevalence in this region (up to 45.76%), and the variant p.R53H was solely observed in patients of MHP. According to the genotype-phenotype prediction, the APV/GPV system was well correlated with the metabolic phenotype of most PAHD patients. We have systematically constructed the mutational and phenotypic spectrum of PAH in Shanxi province. Hence, this study will help to further understand the genotype-phenotype associations in PAHD patients, and it may offer more reliable genetic counseling and management."

    "abstract": "Phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) deficiency leads to phenylalanine accumulation and results in phenylketonuria (PKU). Phenylketonuria can contribute to severe inability such as mental impairment. Early diagnosis and dietary intervention can have beneficial effects on maintaining normal neural and cognitive function in patients with PKU. However, a long-term low phenylalanine diet may put children at risk of malnutrition. A food supplement was therefore used for children with PKU under dietician supervision according to dietary reference intakes (DRIs). In this cross-sectional study, we enrolled patients with PKU and age-matched controls to compare their anthropometry data [weight, height, body mass index (BMI), and body composition using bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA)], and correlated it with their dietary intake based on 24-h dietary recall. For continuous parameters, the data were expressed as median ± standard deviation (SD), and the Mann-Whitney U test was used to test the difference among the groups. Correlation by natural proteins, body fat, and fat-free mass were evaluated using the Pearson correlation coefficient. Twenty-two participants diagnosed with PKU (ages 8-27 years; mean 15.23 ± 5.23) and a control group of 22 non-PKU participants (ages 8-39 years; mean 19.73 ± 10.6) were recruited for this study. Between the two groups of participants, no significant difference was found in height, weight, BMI, muscle mass, or fat mass. The percentage of natural protein has no effect on body composition. We found a significant positive correlation between the total protein intake percentage of DRIs and muscle mass (r = 0.491, p = 0.020) and a significant negative correlation in the total protein intake percentage of DRIs and fat mass (r = -0.475, p = 0.025) in participants with PKU. There were no significant differences in body composition and nutrition intake between patients with PKU (under metabolic control) and healthy subjects. Thus, giving proper nutrition treatment may have beneficial effects on body growth and nutrition status in patients with PKU in Taiwan."

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) can be effectively treated with the use of a low-phenylalanine diet. However, some patients become overweight despite proper dietary treatment. We hypothesized that this phenomenon could be explained by the presence of specific variants within the genes involved in phenylalanine transport or in the phenylalanine transamination/oxygenation pathway. We selected a clinically homogenous group of 100 infants with PKU and assessed their growth patterns in the context of dietary phenylalanine tolerance. Next, within the sample, we performed exome sequencing and assessed a potential relationship between the observed phenotypical variability and the presence of structural variants in a priori selected genes of interest. We detected a highly significant association between overweight and carriership of the rs113883650/rs2287120 haplotype of the <i>SLC7A5</i> (<i>LAT1</i>) gene, which encodes the main transmembrane transporter of large neutral amino acids and of thyroid hormones. Our findings suggest a pharmacogenetic effect of the relatively common rs113883650/rs2287120 haplotype of the <i>SLC7A5</i> gene. This can have practical implications for patients with PKU, since treatment protocols need to be reassessed to better prevent overweight in the carriers of the above variant."

To describe the impact of IBD on psychosocial well-being in young people and to compare well-being in the IBD cohort to well-being among young people with other chronic conditions, with a view to identifying characteristics and challenges unique to those with IBD. Young people with IBD provided demographic information and psychosocial data through a cross-sectional self-report survey. Psychosocial data included the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale, Perceived Stress Scale, Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire, World Health Organisation Well-being Index, Paediatric Quality of Life Inventory, Short Quality of Life Questionnaire for IBD, Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support, Connor Davidson Resilience Scale 2 and the Multidimensional Health Locus of Control Scale. Surveys were collected from 51 young people with IBD and compared with surveys from 210 young people with juvenile rheumatic disease (n = 31), phenylketonuria (n = 21), cystic fibrosis (n = 33), renal transplants (n = 14) and craniomaxillofacial conditions (n = 111). On the psychosocial domains, 41% of young people with IBD had poor well-being and 37% were at risk of depression. When assessed against the comparison group, young people with IBD reported higher depressive symptoms (P = 0.04), worse illness perceptions (P < 0.01) and lower internal locus of control (P < 0.01). Early recognition and treatment of depression and other psychosocial comorbidities within integrated pathways of care is crucial in adolescents and young adults with IBD and likely to improve the course of IBD and their overall health and well-being. Interventions aimed at enhancing self-efficacy and increasing public awareness are also likely to be helpful."

    "abstract": "Phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) has recently emerged as an important therapeutic enzyme with several biomedical applications. The enzyme catabolizes l-phenylalanine to trans-cinnamate and ammonia. PAL is widely distributed in higher plants, some algae, ferns, and microorganisms, but absent in animals. Although microbial PAL has been extensively exploited in the past for producing industrially important metabolites, its high substrate specificity and catalytic efficacy lately spurred interest in its biomedical applications. PEG-PAL drug named Palynziq™, isolated from Anabaena variabilis has been recently approved for the treatment of adult phenylketonuria (PKU) patients. Further, it has exhibited high potency in regressing tumors and treating tyrosine related metabolic abnormalities like tyrosinemia. Several therapeutically valuable metabolites have been biosynthesized via its catalytic action including dietary supplements, antimicrobial peptides, aspartame, amino-acids, and their derivatives. This review focuses on all the prospective biomedical applications of PAL. It also provides an overview of the structure, production parameters, and various strategies to improve the therapeutic potential of this enzyme. Engineered PAL with improved pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties will further establish this enzyme as a highly efficient biological drug."

    "abstract": "In Phenylketonuria (PKU), the peptide structure of the protein substitute (PS), casein glycomacropeptide (CGMP), is supplemented with amino acids (CGMP-AA). CGMP may slow the rate of amino acid (AA) absorption compared with traditional phenylalanine-free amino acids (Phe-free AA), which may improve nitrogen utilization, decrease urea production, and alter insulin response. In children with PKU, to compare pre and postprandial AA concentrations when taking one of three PS's: Phe-free AA, CGMP-AA 1 or 2. 43 children (24 boys, 19 girls), median age 9 years (range 5-16 years) were studied; 11 took CGMP-AA1, 18 CGMP-AA2, and 14 Phe-free AA. Early morning fasting pre and 2 h postprandial blood samples were collected for quantitative AA on one occasion. A breakfast with allocated 20 g protein equivalent from PS was given post fasting blood sample. There was a significant increase in postprandial AA for all individual AAs with all three PS. Postprandial AA histidine (<i>p</i> < 0.001), leucine (<i>p</i> < 0.001), and tyrosine (<i>p</i> < 0.001) were higher in CGMP-AA2 than CGMP-AA1, and leucine (<i>p</i> < 0.001), threonine (<i>p</i> < 0.001), and tyrosine (<i>p</i> = 0.003) higher in GCMP-AA2 than Phe-free AA. This was reflective of the AA composition of the three different PS's. In PKU, the AA composition of CGMP-AA influences 2 h postprandial AA composition, suggesting that a PS derived from CGMP-AA may be absorbed similarly to Phe-free AA, but this requires further investigation."

    "abstract": "Genome editing through adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors is a promising gene therapy strategy for various diseases, especially genetic disorders. However, homologous recombination (HR) efficiency is extremely low in adult animal models. We assumed that increasing AAV transduction efficiency could increase genome editing activity, especially HR efficiency, for in vivo gene therapy. Firstly, a mouse phenylketonuria (PKU) model carrying a pathogenic R408W mutation in phenylalanine hydroxylase (Pah) was generated. Through co-delivery of the general AAV receptor (AAVR), we found that AAVR could dramatically increase AAV transduction efficiency in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, co-delivery of SaCas9/sgRNA/donor templates with AAVR via AAV8 vectors increased indel rate over 2-fold and HR rate over 15-fold for the correction of the single mutation in Pah<sup>R408W</sup> mice. Moreover, AAVR co-injection successfully increased the site-specific insertion rate of a 1.4 kb Pah cDNA by 11-fold, bringing the HR rate up to 7.3% without detectable global off-target effects. Insertion of Pah cDNA significantly decreased the Phe level and ameliorated PKU symptoms. This study demonstrates a novel strategy to dramatically increase AAV transduction which substantially enhanced in vivo genome editing efficiency in adult animal models, showing clinical potential for both conventional and genome editing-based gene therapy."

    "abstract": "There is a need to develop at-home phenylalanine (Phe) test kits, analogous to home glucose meters, for phenylketonuria patients who must measure their blood Phe levels frequently to adjust their diet. Unfortunately, such test kits are not available yet because of the lack of simple and inexpensive Phe-sensing elements. With the goal of developing a Phe-sensing element, we fabricated two-dimensional photonic crystal (2DPC) hydrogels that quantify human serum phenylpyruvate (PhPY), which is the product of the reaction between Phe and the enzyme phenylalanine dehydrogenase. The PhPY-sensing hydrogels have oxyamine recognition groups that link PhPY to the hydrogel polymer network via chemoselective oxime ligation. This structural modification induces the hydrogel to swell, which then increases interparticle spacings within the embedded 2DPC. The PhPY-induced particle spacing changes are measured from light diffraction and used to quantify the PhPY concentrations. The estimated limit of detection of PhPY in human serum for a detection time of 30 min is 19 μM, which is comparable to the minimum blood Phe concentrations of healthy people. Besides the potential application for developing Phe-sensing elements, this new hydrogel sensing approach via chemoselective oxime ligation is generalizable to the development of other chemical sensors working in complex biological environments."

Phe and Tyr metabolism in DNAJC12 deficiency is similar to non-PKU HPA. Differently from BH4 deficiency, BH4 administration in DNAJC12 deficiency does not firmly enhance the rate of Phe hydroxylation. A central effect of BH4 treatment in DNAJC12 deficiency cannot be excluded."

The fact that PEA and PA are both metabolites of phenylalanine (Phe) in humans makes them important indicators in the diagnosis of phenylketonuria. In this work, three-color whole-cell biosensors were developed to simultaneously detect these analytes (Phe, PEA, and PA). The tyrosine-responsive promoter was used to control the production of green fluorescent protein signals in response to Phe levels. The FeaR regulon was first used to indicate the presence of PEA, whereas the Paa regulon was used for the detection of PA. The combination of three sensor strains together made it possible to semiquantify the three analytes according to unique color outputs without cross-interference. We sought to optimize various modular components (ribosomal binding sites and fluorescent proteins) to ensure the rapid generation of fluorescent signals. Finally, the biosensors were implemented within a microchannel device to reduce sample consumption in point-of-care assays."

Research on the subjective burden of IT-IEM remains sparse. Studies with appropriate sample sizes are needed to make valid statements about health-related quality of life (HrQoL) in children and adolescents with IT-IEM. Six international metabolic centres contributed self-reports and proxy reports of HrQoL (assessed with the Paediatric Quality of Life Inventory) to the final data set (n = 251 patients; age range 2.3-18.8 years). To compare HrQoL of the patient sample with norm data and between acute and non-acute IT-IEM, t tests were conducted. To examine the influence of child age, sex, diagnosis and current dietary treatment on HrQoL, multiple linear regression analyses were conducted. Self-reports and proxy reporst showed significantly lower HrQoL total scores for children with IT-IEM compared to healthy children. Current dietary treatment significantly predicted lower proxy reported total HrQoL. Children with non-acute IT-IEM reported significantly lower psychosocial health and emotional functioning than children with acute IT-IEM. The patient sample showed significantly impaired HrQoL and a diet regimen remains a risk factor for lower HrQoL. Differences in HrQoL between acute and non-acute IT-IEM subgroups indicate that factors beyond symptom severity determine the perception of disease burden. Identifying these factors is of crucial importance to develop and implement appropriate interventions for those in need."

Physical, neurocognitive and psychiatric symptoms include neurodevelopmental disorder as intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder. The most common treatments such as low-Phe diet and supplements may decrease blood Phe concentrations, but neuropsychological, behavioral and social issues still occur in some patients. This study aimed to better understand (i) the Brazilian population's knowledge about newborn screening (NBS), the main diagnostic method for PKU, as well as (ii) the impacts of phenylketonuria in the daily lives of patients and parents. Two surveys in Real World Data format gathering of Brazilian residents by online questionnaires with (i) 1000 parents of children up to 5 years old between March and April 2019; (ii) 228 PKU patients and caregivers in March 2019. The survey was conducted in partnership with Abril Publisher and two Brazilian patient associations: Metabolic Mothers and SAFE Brasil, for families with rare diseases and PKU patients, respectively. The first questionnaire shows that 93% of parents recognize the importance of NBS and 92% report that their children have undergone the test. Still, two out of ten participants did not know what the exam is or what it is for. From the second questionnaire nine out of ten patients had their PKU diagnosis by NBS. Although strict dietary controls for PKU were claimed by 44% of respondents from second questionnaire, 55% assume not following all nutritionist recommendations and 52% did not maintain routinely Phe control levels. In addition, 53% said they had high spending on medical appointments, therapies and purchase of special foods. Despite the lack of understanding, the awareness of NBS importance is present in the studied population. The early diagnosis of most PKU patients in the study corroborates with neonatal screening central role of PKU early detection. The difficulty in adhering to dietary adjustments and the possibility that current and new therapeutic strategies other than diet could be determinant to achieve the recommended Phe levels."

Currently, a triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer (TQ-MS) is a common high-accuracy clinical PKU screening method. However, there is high false-positive rate associated with this modality, and its reduction can provide a diagnostic and economic benefit to both pediatric patients and health providers. Machine learning methods have the advantage of utilizing high-dimensional and complex features, which can be obtained from the patient's metabolic patterns and interrogated for clinically relevant knowledge. In this study, using TQ-MS screening data of more than 600,000 patients collected at the Newborn Screening Center of Shanghai Children's Hospital, we derived a dataset containing 256 PKU-suspected cases. We then developed a machine learning logistic regression analysis model with the aim to minimize false-positive rates in the results of the initial PKU test. The model attained a 95-100% sensitivity, the specificity was improved 53.14%, and positive predictive value increased from 19.14 to 32.16%. Our study shows that machine learning models may be used as a pediatric diagnosis aid tool to reduce the number of suspected cases and to help eliminate patient recall. Our study can serve as a future reference for the selection and evaluation of computational screening methods."

    "abstract": "A simple and highly sensitive photoelectrochemical biosensor towards L-phenylalanine, as a kind of typical essential amino acid and phenylketonuria biomarker was developed on a surface molecular imprinted (MIP) polydopamine-coated CdS/CdSe/Zn heterojunction. Hierarchical marigold flower-like Zn layer decorated by n-type dichalcogenides interfacial heterojunction was successfully designed and synthesized on Ti foil for PEC converter by in situ electrodeposition. A visible-light-driven molecular imprinting film was prepared through the electropolymerization of dopamine in the presence of L-Phe as biomarker. The combination of bio-MIP and photoelectrochemistry overcomes the defects of the PEC method, which is the absence of selectivity, and offers a new PEC sensor with high sensitivity and selectivity based on visible-light-driven heterojunction and biopolymer-enhanced strategy. The unique interfacial between the Zn marigold flower layer as low work function support and CdS/CdSe n-n heterojunction as well as n-type characteristics of polydopamine imprinted by L-Phe biomarker drastically increase the light trapping and absorption in the visible range, and dramatically inhibit the charge carrier recombination, which is crucial for boosting the Bio-PEC activity. Photocatalytic, electrocatalytic and physicochemical properties of the above-mentioned layers were fully characterized. As-prepared PEC biosensor displayed superb performance for the detection of L-Phe biomarker in the optimized condition obtained from central composite design modeling, showing two linear range 0.005-2.5 and 2.5-130 μM and a low detection limit of 0.9 nM. This work suggests that such L-Phe-imprinted polydopamine-coated Zn/CdS/CdSe heterojunction is greatly promising for being applied in photoelectrochemical biosensing with high photo-electron conversion efficiency."

Statements encompassed all foods/food groups divided into four categories based on defined protein/phenylalanine content: (1) foods high in protein/phenylalanine (best avoided); (2) foods allowed without restriction including fruit/vegetables containing phenylalanine ≤75 mg/100 g and most foods containing protein ≤0.5 g/100 g; (3) foods that should be calculated/weighed as an exchange food if they contain protein exchange ingredients (categorized into foods with a protein content of: >0.1 g/100 g (milk/plant milks only), >0.5 g/100 g (bread/pasta/cereal/flours), >1 g/100 g (cook-in/table-top sauces/dressings), >1.5 g/100 g (soya sauces)); and (4) fruit/vegetables containing phenylalanine >75 mg/100 g allocated as part of the protein/phenylalanine exchange system. These statements have been endorsed and translated into practical dietary management advice by the medical advisory dietitians for the National Society for PKU (NSPKU)."

    "title": "Phenylketonuria screening in Iranian newborns: a systematic review and meta-analysis.",
    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU), which is characterized by a deficiency of phenylalanine hydroxylase activity, is an autosomal recessive disorder of phenylalanine (Phe) metabolism. Newborn screening is the main population-based public health screening program that allows successful identification and treatment of PKU with low-Phe diet. The aim of this study was to evaluate the epidemiology of PKU screening in Iranian newborns. The present study was designed based on MOOSE protocol and reporting was done in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. The protocol of this systematic review was published in PROSPERO before it was performed (CRD42020162626). A comprehensive search was done in 10/10/2019 to find related literature on international online databases Web of Science, Scopus, EMBASE, Science Direct, PubMed/Medline, EBSCO, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, national online databases and the Google Scholar search engine. Heterogeneity among studies was assessed by I<sup>2</sup> index and Q test. All meta-analyses were performed using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis Software ver. 2. P < 0.05 was considered significant. Finally, 18 studies with 3,339,327 Iranian neonates were included. The prevalence of suspected hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA) was estimated to be 45.6/100,000 (95% CI: 23.9-87.1). The prevalence of suspected HPA in girls and boys infants in Iran was estimated to be 38.0/100,000 (95% CI: 15.1-95.5) and 43.3/100,000 (95% CI: 16.2-116.2), respectively. The prevalence of PKU was estimated to be 16.5/100,000 (95% CI: 12.9-21.2). The prevalence of PKU in girls and boys infants was estimated to be 13.3/100,000 (95% CI: 7.5-15.8) and 10.9/100,000 (95% CI: 7.5-15.8), respectively. The prevalence of mild to moderate HPA was estimated 9.7/100,000 (95% CI: 5.1-18.4) and the prevalence of classical PKU was estimated 4.4/100,000 (95% CI: 2.5-7.8). Sensitivity analysis for all meta-analysis with the omission of one study showed that overall estimation is still robust. The results of this meta-analysis showed that PKU is prevalent in Iranian neonates. It should be considered that for PKU there is a highly effective dietary treatment which can prevent the clinical symptoms of PKU if initiated early after detection by newborn screening."

    "title": "Bone Status in Patients with Phenylketonuria: A Systematic Review.",
    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is the most common inborn error of amino acid metabolism. Although dietary and, in some cases, pharmacological treatment has been successful in preventing intellectual disability in PKU patients who are treated early, suboptimal outcomes have been reported, including bone mineral disease. In this systematic review, we summarize the available evidence on bone health in PKU patients, including data on bone mineral density (BMD) and bone turnover marker data. Data from cohort and cross-sectional studies of children and adults (up to 40 years of age) were obtained by searching the MEDLINE and SCOPUS databases following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. For each selected study, quality assessment was performed applying the Risk Of Bias In Non-randomized Studies of Interventions (ROBINS I) tool. We found that mean BMD was lower in PKU patients than in reference groups, but was within the normal range in most patients when expressed as Z-score values. Furthermore, data revealed a trend towards an imbalance between bone formation and bone resorption, favoring bone removal. Data on serum levels of minerals and hormones involved in bone metabolism were very heterogeneous, and the analyses were inconclusive. Clinical trials that include the analysis of fracture rates, especially in older patients, are needed to gather more evidence on the clinical implications of lower BMD in PKU patients."

    "title": "Protein Degradation and the Pathologic Basis of Phenylketonuria and Hereditary Tyrosinemia.",
    "abstract": "A delicate intracellular balance among protein synthesis, folding, and degradation is essential to maintaining protein homeostasis or proteostasis, and it is challenged by genetic and environmental factors. Molecular chaperones and the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) play a vital role in proteostasis for normal cellular function. As part of protein quality control, molecular chaperones recognize misfolded proteins and assist in their refolding. Proteins that are beyond repair or refolding undergo degradation, which is largely mediated by the UPS. The importance of protein quality control is becoming ever clearer, but it can also be a disease-causing mechanism. Diseases such as phenylketonuria (PKU) and hereditary tyrosinemia-I (HT1) are caused due to mutations in <i>PAH</i> and <i>FAH</i> gene, resulting in reduced protein stability, misfolding, accelerated degradation, and deficiency in functional proteins. Misfolded or partially unfolded proteins do not necessarily lose their functional activity completely. Thus, partially functional proteins can be rescued from degradation by molecular chaperones and deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs). Deubiquitination is an important mechanism of the UPS that can reverse the degradation of a substrate protein by covalently removing its attached ubiquitin molecule. In this review, we discuss the importance of molecular chaperones and DUBs in reducing the severity of PKU and HT1 by stabilizing and rescuing mutant proteins."

    "abstract": "The gold standard treatment for phenylketonuria (PKU) is a lifelong low-phenylalanine (Phe) diet supplemented with Phe-free protein substitutes. Adherence to therapy becomes difficult after childhood. Supplementing with large neutral amino acids (LNAAs) has been proposed as an alternative medication to Phe-free protein substitutes (i.e., amino acid mixtures). The aim of this study was to evaluate adherence to therapy and quality of life (QoL) in a cohort of sub-optimally controlled adult PKU patients treated with a new LNAA formulation. Twelve patients were enrolled in a 12-month-trial of slow-release LNAAs (1g/kg/day) plus a Phe-restricted diet. Medication adherence was measured with the Morisky Green Levine Medication Adherence Scale; the QoL was measured using the phenylketonuria-quality of life (PKU-QoL) questionnaire. Phe, tyrosine (Tyr) levels, and Phe/Tyr ratios were measured fortnightly. Before treatment, 3/12 patients self-reported a 'medium' adherence to medication and 9/12 reported a low adherence; 60% of patients reported a full adherence over the past four weeks. After 12 months of LNAA treatment, all patients self-reported a high adherence to medication, with 96% reporting a full adherence. Phe levels remained unchanged, while Tyr levels increased in most patients. The Phy/Tyr ratio decreased. All patients had a significant improvement in the QoL. LNAAs may give patients a further opportunity to improve medication adherence and, consequently, their QoL."

    "title": "Dietary interventions for phenylketonuria.",
    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria is an inherited disease treated with dietary restriction of the amino acid phenylalanine. The diet is initiated in the neonatal period to prevent learning disability; however, it is restrictive and can be difficult to follow. Whether the diet can be relaxed or discontinued during adolescence or should be continued for life remains a controversial issue, which we aim to address in this review. This is an updated version of a previously published review. To assess the effects of a low-phenylalanine diet commenced early in life for people with phenylketonuria. To assess the possible effects of relaxation or termination of the diet on intelligence, neuropsychological outcomes and mortality, growth, nutritional status, eating behaviour and quality of life. We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Most recent search of the Inborn Errors of Metabolism Trials Register: 30 April 2020. All randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing a low-phenylalanine diet to relaxation or termination of dietary restrictions in people with phenylketonuria. Two authors independently assessed study eligibility and methodological quality, and subsequently extracted the data. We included four studies in this review (251 participants), and found few significant differences between treatment and comparison groups for the outcomes of interest. Blood phenylalanine levels were significantly lower in participants with phenylketonuria following a low-phenylalanine diet compared to those on a less restricted diet, mean difference (MD) at three months -698.67 (95% confidence interval (CI) -869.44 to -527.89). Intelligence quotient was significantly higher in participants who continued the diet than in those who stopped the diet, MD after 12 months 5.00 (95% CI 0.40 to 9.60). However, these results came from a single study. The results of non-randomised studies have concluded that a low-phenylalanine diet is effective in reducing blood phenylalanine levels and improving intelligence quotient and neuropsychological outcomes. We were unable to find any randomised controlled studies that have assessed the effect of a low-phenylalanine diet versus no diet from diagnosis. In view of evidence from non-randomised studies, such a study would be unethical and it is recommended that low-phenylalanine diet should be commenced at the time of diagnosis. There is uncertainty about the precise level of phenylalanine restriction and when, if ever, the diet should be relaxed. This should be addressed by randomised controlled studies; however, no new studies are expected in this area so we do not plan to update this review."

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU), caused by variants in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene, is the most common autosomal-recessive Mendelian phenotype of amino acid metabolism. We estimated that globally 0.45 million individuals have PKU, with global prevalence 1:23,930 live births (range 1:4,500 [Italy]-1:125,000 [Japan]). Comparing genotypes and metabolic phenotypes from 16,092 affected subjects revealed differences in disease severity in 51 countries from 17 world regions, with the global phenotype distribution of 62% classic PKU, 22% mild PKU, and 16% mild hyperphenylalaninemia. A gradient in genotype and phenotype distribution exists across Europe, from classic PKU in the east to mild PKU in the southwest and mild hyperphenylalaninemia in the south. The c.1241A>G (p.Tyr414Cys)-associated genotype can be traced from Northern to Western Europe, from Sweden via Norway, to Denmark, to the Netherlands. The frequency of classic PKU increases from Europe (56%) via Middle East (71%) to Australia (80%). Of 758 PAH variants, c.1222C>T (p.Arg408Trp) (22.2%), c.1066-11G>A (IVS10-11G>A) (6.4%), and c.782G>A (p.Arg261Gln) (5.5%) were most common and responsible for two prevalent genotypes: p.[Arg408Trp];[Arg408Trp] (11.4%) and c.[1066-11G>A];[1066-11G>A] (2.6%). Most genotypes (73%) were compound heterozygous, 27% were homozygous, and 55% of 3,659 different genotypes occurred in only a single individual. PAH variants were scored using an allelic phenotype value and correlated with pre-treatment blood phenylalanine concentrations (n = 6,115) and tetrahydrobiopterin loading test results (n = 4,381), enabling prediction of both a genotype-based phenotype (88%) and tetrahydrobiopterin responsiveness (83%). This study shows that large genotype databases enable accurate phenotype prediction, allowing appropriate targeting of therapies to optimize clinical outcome."

    "title": "Neonatal phenylalanine wash-out in phenylketonuria.",
    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is the most common inborn error of amino acids metabolism. PKU management aims to keep as soon as possible blood phenylalanine (Phe), a non-acutely neurotoxic metabolite, within safe ranges through a dietary Phe restriction tailored to individual dietary Phe tolerance. Information on initial neonatal management of PKU, when Phe tolerance is still unknown, is scanty. We reviewed the metabolic data from 304 patients with PAH deficiency detected at newborn screening within the last 37 years. In keeping with the general neonatal management of intoxication-type inborn errors of metabolism, initial management consisted in a Phe wash-out through the exclusive administration of normocaloric Phe-free formulas until normalization of blood Phe. Based on genotype and Phe tolerance assessed at follow-up, 55 patients had classic PKU (18%), 50 mild PKU (17%), and 199 non-PKU hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA) (65%). The duration of Phe wash-out amounted to 7 ± 2 days in classic PKU, 4 ± 2 days in mild PKU, and < 24 h in non-PKU HPA (p < 0.001). After the wash-out, dietary Phe re-introduction and its upwardly titration allowed the assessment of individual metabolic phenotype. During the first 6 years of life, Phe tolerance was stable in classic PKU (~ 200 mg/day) but increased in milder forms, allowing unrestricted diet in non-PKU HPA. Neonatal Phe wash-out in PKU ensures the earliest correction of HPA. This metabolic reset also facilitates the prompt definition of individual Phe tolerance, allowing anticipation of dietary personalization and optimization of longitudinal metabolic control."

Phenylalanine (Phe) concentrations in these dry blood spots were measured by the fluorescence method to screen phenylketonuria (PKU). A second dry blood spot sample will be collected if suspicious samples were detected after initial screening. Tandem mass spectrometry were used to detect the concentrations of Phe and tyrosine. Urine samples of the suspected newborns were sent out for urotrexate spectrum analysis and tetrahydrobiopterin loading test. PCR and flow-through rapid hybridization method were employed to detect PAH gene mutations. Meanwhile, peripheral blood samples of suspicious newborns of PKU and their parents were collected to perform gene sequencing. <b>Results:</b> Among the 380 996 newborns, 39 were suspected and 14 were diagnosed with PKU, including 11 cases of PAH deficiency and 3 cases of tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency. Of 14 confirmed cases, there were 8 male cases and 6 female cases. In the newborn population of Hainan province, the annual incidence of PKU was 1.22/100 000. Thirteen PAH gene mutations were detected in confirmed cases: c.728G>A, c.158G>A, c.1238G>C, c.611A>G, c.1068C>A, c.706+5G>A, c.740G>T, c.1081A>T, c.793T>G, c.1223G>A, c.721C>T, c.331C>T and c.1174T>A. <b>Conclusions:</b> PKU has a high incidence in newborn population of Hainan province in the past three years.

    "abstract": "Objective and methods To evaluate variation of capillary phenylalanine concentrations over the day in patients treated for phenylketonuria and the reliability of the morning sample to assess metabolic control, we conducted a repeated cross-sectional study in 25 Tunisian patients on phenylalanine-low diet. For each patient, we collected nine capillary samples over the day. Phenylalanine was dosed by fluorimetry. Results There was a wide variability of phenylalanine concentrations over the day (p<0.001). Compared to morning sample, phenylalanine concentration was significantly lower before lunch (p=0.038), after lunch (p=0.025), before dinner (p<0.001), after dinner (p=0.035) and at 4:00 a.m. (p=0.011). Compared to the 24 h sampling, the morning sample had a 68% to identify unbalanced patients. 60% of patients, had peak phenylalanine concentration after the morning. Half of the patients with normal morning phenylalanine concentration had low phenylalanine values over 8-20 h. Percentages of high phenylalanine concentrations over the last semester were higher in patients with poor metabolic control over the 24 h (21% ± 43 vs. 0% ± 9%); p=0.043. Conclusion A single morning sample gives an incomplete information on metabolic control in phenylketonuric patients. Using four pre-prandial samples on the day should be considered as alternative in patients with good metabolic control."

We aimed to assess the long-term clinical outcome of this disorder and the factors affecting it. At total of 28 PTPSd patients (aged 19.9 ± 10.9 years) underwent clinical (neurological and psychiatric) and neuropsychological assessment (BRIEF, VABS-II, and IQ). Based on CSF homovanillic (HVA) and 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid (5-HIAA) and pterin concentrations at diagnosis, patients were classified as having either a severe [SF; low level of CSF, HVA, and 5-HIAA with altered neopterin/biopterin (Neo/Bio)] or mild form (MF; normal HVA and 5-HIAA with altered Neo/Bio) of PTPSd. Approximately 36% of patients had MF PTPSd. At the last examination, 43% of patients had movement disorders (2 MF, 10 SF), 43% of patients had variable degrees of intellectual disability (SF only), 39% met the criteria for a psychiatric disorder (3 MF, 9 SF). Applying a linear regression model, we found that HVA and phenylalanine levels at birth had a significant influence on IQ, BRIEF, and VABS-II variability. Lastly, 5-HIAA further contributed to VABS-II variability. The disease showed a self-limiting clinical course and its treatment, although delayed, is effective in improving the neurological status. Neurodevelopmental impairment due to PTPSd shows a self-limiting course. A continuous improvement in the neurological condition has been observed in patients receiving treatment, even when delayed. The severity of brain biogenic amine depletion at diagnosis predicts neurological and psychiatric outcomes."

We compared variables in the groups with and without impaired QOL and the SF-36 scores between subgroups of parents and children and between our sample and the Tunisian general population based on published data. We looked for associations between SF-36 scores and quantitative variables. Linear regression and logistic binary regression were used for multivariate analysis. Results Sixty-five parents from 42 families participated. QOL was impaired in 61% of them. The mean SF-36 score was 55.3 ± 25.07. The physical component sub-score was higher than that reported in the Tunisian general population (63.66 ± 27.77 vs. 50.11 ± 8.53; p<0.001). The mental component sub-score was comparable to that reported in the Tunisian general population (46.99 ± 25.94 vs. 47.96 ± 9.82; p=0.830). Gender (mothers) (p=0.008), low monthly income (p = 0.027), low education (p=0.011), and autism in PKU children (p = 0.001) were associated with impaired QOL. Conclusions We identified at risk parents for altered quality of life among parents of PKU children. Our findings were used to develop a psychological and social support strategy for at-risk parents and to promote the implementation of newborn screening of this treatable disease in our low-income country."

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria and tyrosinemia type 1 are treated with dietary phenylalanine (Phe) restriction. Aspartame is a Phe-containing synthetic sweetener used in many products, including many 'regular' soft drinks. Its amount is (often) not declared; therefore, patients are advised not to consume aspartame-containing foods. This study aimed to determine the variation in aspartame concentrations and its Phe-containing degradation products in aspartame-containing soft drinks. For this, an LC-MS/MS method was developed for the analysis of aspartame, Phe, aspartylphenylalanine, and diketopiperazine in soft drinks. In total, 111 regularly used soft drinks from 10 European countries were analyzed. The method proved linear and had an inter-assay precision (CV%) below 5% for aspartame and higher CVs% of 4.4-49.6% for the degradation products, as many concentrations were at the limit of quantification. Aspartame and total Phe concentrations in the aspartame-containing soft drinks varied from 103 to 1790 µmol/L (30-527 mg/L) and from 119 to 2013 µmol/L (20-332 mg/L), respectively, and were highly variable among similar soft drinks bought in different countries. Since Phe concentrations between drinks and countries highly vary, we strongly advocate the declaration of the amount of aspartame on soft drink labels, as some drinks may be suitable for consumption by patients with Phe-restricted diets."

    "title": "Pegvaliase for the treatment of phenylketonuria: Results of the phase 2 dose-finding studies with long-term follow-up.",
    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is characterized by a deficiency in phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) that may lead to elevated blood phenylalanine (Phe) and significant neurocognitive and neuropsychological comorbidities. Pegvaliase (PALYNZIQ®, BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc.) is a PEGylated recombinant Anabaena variabilis phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), which converts Phe to trans-cinnamic acid and ammonia, and was approved in May 2018 in the United States and in May 2019 in the European Union for decreasing blood Phe levels in adults with PKU with blood Phe levels >600 μmol/L. The efficacy and safety of pegvaliase was assessed in two phase 2 dose-finding studies in adults with PKU (PAL-002, NCT00925054, and PAL-004, NCT01212744). Participants completing these studies could enroll in a long-term extension study (PAL-003, NCT00924703). Participants in PAL-002 received pegvaliase 0.001, 0.003, 0.01, 0.03, or 0.1 mg/kg weekly for 8 weeks, then continued treatment for a further 8 weeks with dose and/or frequency adjusted to achieve blood Phe concentrations of 60 to 600 μmol/L. Participants in PAL-004 received pegvaliase 0.001 to 0.4 mg/kg 5 days/week for 13 weeks, with modifications made to the starting dose in response to safety and/or efficacy, followed by 3 additional weeks of follow-up assessments. The maximum allowable daily dose in both studies was 1.0 mg/kg/day (5.0 mg/kg/week). Participants who completed any of the phase 2 studies (PAL-002; PAL-004; or a third phase 2 study, 165-205) were eligible to enroll in an open-label, multicenter, long-term extension study (PAL-003, NCT00924703). Thirty-seven of the 40 enrolled participants completed PAL-002 and 15 of the 16 enrolled participants completed PAL-004. Mean blood Phe at baseline was 1311.0 (standard deviation [SD] 354) μmol/L in PAL-002 and 1482.1 (SD 363.5) μmol/L in PAL-004. Mean blood Phe did not substantially decrease with pegvaliase treatment in PAL-002 (-206.3 [SD 287.1] μmol/L at Week 16) or PAL-004 (-410.8 [SD 653.7] μmol/L at Week 13). In PAL-004, mean blood Phe dropped from baseline by 929.1 μmol/L (SD 691.1) by Week 2; subsequent to dose modifications and interruptions, this early decrease in mean Phe level was not sustained. With increased pegvaliase dose and duration in PAL-003, mean blood Phe levels steadily decreased from baseline, with mean reductions by Week 120 of 68.8% (SD 44.2%) in PAL-002 participants and 75.9% (SD 32.4%) in PAL-004 participants. All participants in PAL-002 and PAL-004 reported ≥1 adverse event (AE), with higher exposure-adjusted event rates in PAL-004. The majority of AEs were mild (87.2% in PAL-002, 86.7% in PAL-004) or moderate (12.4% in PAL-002, 13.3% in PAL-004). The most commonly reported AEs in PAL-002 were injection site reaction (50.0% of participants), headache (42.1%), injection site erythema (36.8%), nausea (34.2%), and arthralgia (29.0%), and in PAL-004 were arthralgia (75.0%), headache (62.5%), dizziness (56.3%), injection site erythema (56.3%), and injection site reaction (50.0%). In two phase 2 dose-finding studies, pegvaliase did not lead to substantial blood Phe reductions. Higher and more frequent pegvaliase dosing in PAL-004 led to a substantial initial drop in blood Phe, but an increase in the number of hypersensitivity AEs and dose reductions or interruptions. With increased dose and duration of treatment in PAL-003, mean blood Phe reduction was substantial and sustained, and the frequency of hypersensitivity AEs decreased and stabilized. Together, these studies led to the development of an induction-titration-maintenance regimen that has been approved for pegvaliase, with patients starting at a low weekly dose that gradually increases in dose and frequency until they achieve a standard non-weight-based daily maintenance dose. This regimen has been tested in a third phase 2 study, as well as in two successful phase 3 studies of pegvaliase."

    "abstract": "Radiation enteritis (RE) is a common side effect after radiotherapy for abdominal cancer. RE pathogenesis is complicated, with no drugs available for prevention or treatments. Intestinal ischemia is a key factor in the occurrence and development of enteritis. The effect of ionizing radiation (IR) on intestinal ischemia is unknown. Deficiency of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH<sub>4</sub>) produced by GTP-cyclohydrolase 1 (Gch1) is important in ischemic diseases. This study focused on the relationship of Gch1/BH<sub>4</sub> between intestinal ischemia in radiation enteritis. BH<sub>4</sub> levels were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography in humans and rats after radiotherapy. Intestinal blood perfusion was measured by laser doppler flow imaging. Vascular ring tests determined the diastolic functions of rat mesenteric arteries. Gene, protein, and immunohistochemical staining experiments and inhibitor interventions were used to investigate Gch1 and endothelial NOS (eNOS) in rat mesenteric arteries and endothelial cells. The results showed that IR decreased BH<sub>4</sub> levels in patients and rats after radiotherapy and decreased intestinal blood perfusion in rats. The degree of change in intestinal ischemia was consistent with intestinal villus injury. Gch1 mRNA and protein levels and nitric oxide (NO) production significantly decreased, while eNOS uncoupling in arterial and vascular endothelial cells strongly increased. BH<sub>4</sub> supplementation improved eNOS uncoupling and NO levels in vascular endothelia after IR. The results of this study showed that downregulation of Gch1 in intestinal blood vessels after IR is an important target in RE. BH<sub>4</sub> supplementation may prevent intestinal ischemia and improve vascular endothelial function after IR. These findings have clinical significance for the prevention and treatment of RE."

    "abstract": "This is the first study to evaluate vitamin K status in relation to dietary intake and phenylalanine dietary compliance in patients with phenylketonuria (PKU). The dietary and PKU formula intake of vitamin K was calculated in 34 PKU patients, with vitamin K status determined by the measurement of prothrombin induced by vitamin K absence (PIVKA-II). Blood phenylalanine concentrations in the preceding 12 months were considered. There were significantly more phenylalanine results exceeding 6 mg/dL in patients with normal PIVKA-II concentrations than in those with abnormal PIVKA-II levels (<i>p</i> = 0.035). Similarly, a higher total intake of vitamin K and dietary vitamin intake expressed as μg/day (<i>p</i> = 0.033 for both) and %RDA (<i>p</i> = 0.0002 and <i>p</i> = 0.003, respectively) was observed in patients with normal PIVKA-II levels. Abnormal PIVKA-II concentrations were associated with a lower OR (0.1607; 95%CI: 0.0273-0.9445, <i>p</i> = 0.043) of having a median phenylalanine concentration higher than 6 mg/dL. In conclusion, vitamin K deficiency is not uncommon in phenylketonuria and may also occur in patients with adequate vitamin K intake. PKU patients with better dietary compliance have a higher risk of vitamin K deficiency. The present findings highlight the need for further studies to re-evaluate dietary recommendations regarding vitamin K intake, both concerning formula-based and dietary consumption of natural products."

    "abstract": "For many inborn metabolic diseases, a lifelong diet is a crucial part of the therapy since pharmacological therapy is available for only a few conditions and patients. The implementation of a low natural protein diet with a reduced intake of natural protein and the complementary use of synthetic amino acid mixtures is described using the examples of phenylketonuria and urea cycle disorders focusing on children and adolescents. For phenylketonuria, the amino acid supplement is free of phenylalanine whereas for urea cycle disorders, it exclusively consists of essential amino acids. The dietary treatment aims to maintain metabolic stability and to prevent accumulation of toxic metabolites. At the same time, the nutritional requirements to ensure growth and development must be met. Therefore, patients need to follow strict rules regarding the choice of food products. This restrictive therapy interferes with the desire for autonomy and the joy of eating and often results in a reduced quality of life.Following the diet is crucial for a favorable outcome. To meet its requirements, patients and their families are provided with training. It is a great challenge not only to support the patients and their families in all practical aspects of dietary management, but also to motivate them to lifelong adherence in order to ensure the best possible outcome."

General and patent-oriented insights into the application of native and humanized yeasts for production of human glycoproteins (gps) and antibodies (Abs), toxicity/mutagenicity assays, treatments of gastrointestinal (GI) disorders and potential drug delivery as a probiotic (with emphasis on <i>Saccharomyces bulardii</i>) and studies on human diseases/cancers and screening effective drugs. Humanized yeasts cover the classical advantageous features of a 'microbial eukaryote' together with advanced human cellular processes. These unique characteristics would permit their use in the production of functional and stable therapeutic gps and Abs in lower prices compared to mammalian (CHO) production-based systems. Availability of yeasts humanized for cytochrome P450 s will expand their application in metabolism-related chemical toxicity assays. Engineered <i>S. bulardii</i> for expression of human proteins might expand its application by synergistically combining the probiotic activity with the treatment of metabolic diseases such as phenylketonuria via GI-delivery. Yeast models of human diseases will facilitate rapid functional/phenotypic characterization of the disease-producing mutant genes and screening of the therapeutic compounds using yeast-based high-throughput research techniques (Yeast one/two hybrid systems) and viability assays."

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) due to recessively inherited phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) deficiency is among the most common inborn errors of metabolism. Dietary therapy begun early in infancy prevents the major manifestations of the disease but shortcomings to treatment continue to exist including lifelong commitment to a complicated and unpalatable diet, poor adherence to diet in adolescence and adulthood, and consequently a range of unsatisfactory outcomes, including neuropsychiatric disorders, frequently develop. Novel treatments that do not strictly depend upon dietary protein restriction are actively sought. This review discusses the potential for and the limitations of permanently curative cell-directed treatment of PKU, including liver-directed gene therapy and gene editing, if initiated during early infancy. A fictional but realistic vignette of a family with a new baby girl recently diagnosed with PKU is presented. What is needed to permanently cure her?"

The impact of dietary factors and plasma phenylalanine levels on growth, BMI, body composition, and bone mineral density was investigated in our cohort of patients with hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA) with or without dietary treatment. The anthropometric, metabolic, BMI and other nutritional indicators and bone mineral density were compared between the group of 96 treated patients with PKU (58 classic PKU (cPKU) and 38 patients with moderate-mild PKU defined as non-classic PKU (non-cPKU)) and the untreated group of 62 patients with benign HPA. Having compared the treated and untreated groups, there were normal outcomes and no statistically significant differences in BMI, body composition, and bone mineral density. Lower body height standard deviation scores were observed in the treated as compared to the untreated group (P < 0.001), but the difference was not significant when analyzing patients older than 18 years; however, cPKU adults were shorter compared to non-cPKU treated adults (P = 0.012). Interestingly, the whole-body fat was statistically higher in non-cPKU as compared to cPKU patients. In conclusion, the dietary treatment ensured adequate nutrition without significant consequences in BMI, body composition, and bone mineral density. A low protein diet may have delayed the growth in childhood, but the treated patients gained a normal final height. Mild untreated hyperphenylalaninemia characteristic for benign HPA had no negative physiological effect on bone mineral density."

But DNAJC12-associated HPA is a rare in Chinese population so far. The clinical information and blood samples from the patient and his family members were collected and analyzed. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was used to identify the causative gene. We reported a newborn patient with HPA, having excluded the causes in common genes associated with HPA. By using whole-exome sequencing, novel compound heterozygosity mutations in DNAJC12 were found, namely c.306C>G (p.His102Gln) and c.182delA (p.Lys61Argfs*6). Administering a diet with low phenylalanine combined with tetrahydrobiopterin and neurotransmitter precursors were shown to be effective in preventing neurodevelopmental delay for these patients. Our finding confirms the diagnosis of DNAJC12-associated HPA and suggests that genetic detection of DNAJC12 should be considered when newborn screening results are positive for HPA."

    "abstract": "The goal of screening programs for inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) is early detection and timely intervention to significantly reduce morbidity, mortality and associated disabilities. Phenylketonuria exemplifies their success as neonates are identified at birth and then promptly treated allowing normal neurological development. Lysosomal diseases comprise about 50 IEM arising from a deficiency in a protein required for proper lysosomal function. Typically, these defects are in lysosomal enzymes with the concomitant accumulation of the enzyme's substrate as the cardinal feature. None of the lysosomal diseases are screened at birth in Australia and in the absence of a family history, traditional laboratory diagnosis of the majority, involves demonstrating a deficiency of the requisite enzyme. Diagnostic confusion can arise from interpretation of the degree of residual enzyme activity causative of disease and is impractical when the disorder is not due to an enzyme deficiency <i>per se</i>. Advances in mass spectrometry technologies has enabled simultaneous measurement of the enzymes' substrates and their metabolites which facilitates the efficiency of diagnosis. Employing urine chemistry as a reflection of multisystemic disease, individual lysosomal diseases can be identified by a characteristic substrate pattern complicit with the enzyme deficiency. Determination of lipids in plasma allows the diagnosis of a further class of lysosomal disorders, the sphingolipids. The ideal goal would be to measure biomarkers for each specific lysosomal disorder in the one mass spectrometry-based platform to achieve a diagnosis. Confirmation of the diagnosis is usually by identifying pathogenic variants in the underlying gene, and although molecular genetic technologies can provide the initial diagnosis, the biochemistry will remain important for interpreting molecular variants of uncertain significance."

These findings were supported by the results of secondary endpoints. Prolongation of AA absorption was associated with modulation of several metabolic markers.

The aims of this study were to evaluate vitamin B12 status in phenylketonuria patients by using combined indicator of vitamin B12 status (cB12) as well as methylmalonic acid and homocysteine, more specific and sensitive markers, in comparison with healthy controls. Fifty-three children and adolescents with phenylketonuria under dietary treatment and 30 healthy controls were assessed cross-sectionally. Serum vitamin B12 and folate concentrations were analysed by chemiluminescence immunoassay. Plasma methylmalonic acid and total homocysteine concentrations were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography, respectively. cB12 was calculated by using a formula involving blood parameters. Methylmalonic acid and folate concentrations in phenylketonuria group were higher compared with controls. Methylmalonic acid concentrations were high in 56.5% of the patients and 26.7% of the controls with normal vitamin B12 concentrations. Based on cB12, a significant difference within the normal values was detected between the groups. However, although 24.5% of phenylketonuria patients and 13.3% of controls had decreased vitamin B12 status according to cB12, there was no significant difference. Children and adolescents with phenylketonuria having a strict diet can be at risk of functional vitamin B12 deficiency. This deficiency can be accurately determined by measuring methylmalonic acid concentrations. Calculation of cB12 as a biochemical index did not provide additional information compared with the measurement of methylmalonic acid alone, but may be helpful for classification of some patients with increased methylmalonic acid as having adequate vitamin B12 status."

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is the most prevalent inborn error of amino acid metabolism. The disease is due to the deficiency of phenylalanine (Phe) hydroxylase activity, which causes the accumulation of Phe. Early diagnosis through neonatal screening is essential for early treatment implementation, avoiding cognitive impairment and other irreversible sequelae. Treatment is based on Phe restriction in the diet that should be maintained throughout life. High dietary restrictions can lead to imbalances in specific nutrients, notably lipids. Previous studies in PKU patients revealed changes in levels of plasma/serum lipoprotein lipids, as well as in fatty acid profile of plasma and red blood cells. Most studies showed a decrease in important polyunsaturated fatty acids, namely DHA (22:6n-3), AA (20:4n-6) and EPA (20:5n-6). Increased oxidative stress and subsequent lipid peroxidation have also been observed in PKU. Despite the evidences that the lipid profile is changed in PKU patients, more studies are needed to understand in detail how lipidome is affected. As highlighted in this review, mass spectrometry-based lipidomics is a promising approach to evaluate the effect of the diet restrictions on lipid metabolism in PKU patients, monitor their outcome, namely concerning the risk for other chronic diseases, and find possible prognosis biomarkers."

Early supplementation of neurotransmitter precursors and where appropriate, treatment of HPA results in significant improvement of motor and cognitive function. Management approaches differ across the world and therefore these guidelines have been developed aiming to harmonize and optimize patient care. Representatives of the International Working Group on Neurotransmitter related Disorders (iNTD) developed the guidelines according to the SIGN (Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network) methodology by evaluating all available evidence for the diagnosis and treatment of BH<sub>4</sub> deficiencies. Although the total body of evidence in the literature was mainly rated as low or very low, these consensus guidelines will help to harmonize clinical practice and to standardize and improve care for BH<sub>4</sub> deficient patients."
