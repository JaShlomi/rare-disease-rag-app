    "title": "Unmasking Pulmonary Nocardiosis in an Asthmatic Host Presenting With Chronic Cough, Pulmonary Nodularity, and Ground-Glass Opacities.",
    "abstract": "A 53-year-old man was evaluated in the pulmonary clinic for ongoing asthma symptoms. Despite optimized treatment, he continued to experience a chronic productive cough. He was otherwise physically active, a lifelong non-smoker with no known occupational or environmental exposures. Pulmonary function tests demonstrated normal diffusing capacity and mild airflow obstruction. A chest computed tomography (CT) scan revealed basilar bronchiectasis, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, scattered nodules, and progressive ground-glass opacities (GGOs) in the bilateral lower lobes. Immunoglobulin (Ig) testing showed an isolated IgG3 deficiency, while other Ig subclasses were within normal limits. Additional laboratory workup, including alpha-1 antitrypsin levels, antinuclear antibody, and HIV serologies, was unremarkable. Bronchoscopy was performed, and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cultures grew pan-sensitive <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, prompting a course of levofloxacin. Despite an initial negative acid-fast bacilli (AFB) stain, cultures later identified <i>Nocardia nova</i>. Given this diagnosis, a head CT was obtained to assess for central nervous system involvement, which was negative. The patient was initially started on trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole but developed an adverse reaction, necessitating a switch to an extended course of intravenous ceftriaxone, which was later changed to clarithromycin based on susceptibility testing. A repeat chest CT demonstrated resolution of nodularity, GGOs, and lymphadenopathy. His symptoms fully resolved, with no recurrence of cough or asthma-like exacerbations. Although <i>Nocardia</i> infections are commonly associated with immunosuppression, typically occurring in patients with solid organ or hematopoietic cell transplants, chronic glucocorticoid use, malignancy, or HIV with low CD4 counts, approximately one-third of cases are reported in immunocompetent individuals. While cellular immunocompromise is a well-established risk factor, isolated IgG3 deficiency is not. Asthma, particularly when treated with corticosteroids or accompanied by structural lung disease, is also recognized as a key predisposing respiratory condition. Pulmonary involvement is most frequent, though dissemination to the central nervous system and skin can also occur. This case underscores the need to consider pulmonary nocardiosis even in patients without an overtly immunocompromised state who present with unexplained respiratory symptoms. Diagnosis requires a high index of clinical suspicion and may necessitate bronchoscopy or other invasive procedures when initial treatments fail. Prompt identification and targeted antimicrobial therapy are essential for a favorable outcome."

    "title": "Sleep Apnea Among Individuals with Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency-Associated Lung Disease.",
    "abstract": "Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a genetic condition that has high rates of associated COPD. We explored whether obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) diagnosis, excessive sleepiness, and OSA risk scores differ by AATD genotype. A cross-sectional survey was completed by individuals with AATD-associated lung disease. Multivariate logistic regression was used to examine the association of genotype and other participant characteristics with: 1) self-reported OSA diagnosis, 2) excessive sleepiness measured by Epworth Sleepiness Scale, and 3) risk of OSA measured by STOP-BAG. We also examined whether characteristics such as body mass index (BMI) differ by genotype, using chi-square tests. Of the 1137 participants, 31.57% had been diagnosed with OSA. Individuals with low-to-moderate risk genotypes (e.g., MZ, SZ) had a higher rate of OSA diagnosis than severe deficiency genotypes (e.g., ZZ, ZNull): 39.76% vs 26.76% (p<0.001) and were more likely to have excessive sleepiness if diagnosed with OSA (31.52% vs 19.79%, p=0.012). These differences remained statistically significant in multivariate models: for OSA diagnosis OR=1.37, p=0.046 and for excessive sleepiness OR=1.87, p=0.021. Individuals with low-to-moderate risk genotypes had a higher rate of BMI >35 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (17.86% vs 8.31%, p<0.001) and were more likely to have smoked ≥40 pack-years (29.60% vs 8.16%, p<0.001). Among individuals with AATD-associated lung disease, OSA is highly prevalent. Differential OSA prevalence by genotype in the AATD population may be driven by health behaviors such as smoking and weight management. Direct comparison to populations without AATD is needed to define if AATD directly contributes to OSA risk."

    "title": "Severe alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is associated with a higher risk of complications after first decompensation than other aetiologies of cirrhosis.",
    "abstract": "Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) causes/predisposes to advanced chronic liver disease. However, the role of the <i>SERPINA1</i> Pi∗ZZ genotype in patients with decompensated cirrhosis is unclear. Thus, we evaluated the impact of the Pi∗ZZ genotype on the disease course after the first hepatic decompensation event. We retrospectively included 59 adults with decompensated cirrhosis and severe AATD (Pi∗ZZ) from 12 European tertiary care centres. First decompensation was considered as baseline. To compare the course of AATD to other cirrhosis aetiologies, we applied propensity score matching for Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) score as well as age/sex. Patients were followed until further decompensation, liver transplantation or liver-related death. Most patients were male (74.6%), with a mean age of 55 years. The most common type of first decompensation was ascites (n = 40; 67.8%), followed by variceal bleeding (n = 13; 22.0%) and overt hepatic encephalopathy (n = 6; 10.2%). Median CTP and MELD (model for end-stage liver disease) scores at first decompensation were 8 and 14, respectively. Median MELD scores were 16 and 20 points at listing and liver transplantation (median time on list: 2.9 [IQR 1.1-7.2] months), respectively. Patients with other aetiologies (subdistribution hazard ratio: steatotic liver disease: 0.62, 95% CI 0.44-0.88, <i>p =</i> 0.007; abstinent alcohol-associated liver disease: 0.50, 95% CI 0.35-0.71, <i>p</i> <0.001; hepatitis C virus-associated cirrhosis: 0.56, 95% CI 0.37-0.83, <i>p =</i> 0.004) had a significantly lower risk of further hepatic decompensation, liver transplantation, or liver-related death, compared to those with Pi∗ZZ. Exchanging further decompensation with acute-on-chronic liver failure yielded similar results. Our study defines the course of decompensated cirrhosis in patients with severe AATD (Pi∗ZZ), who are particularly prone to complications of cirrhosis and exhibit a more progressive disease course than those with cirrhosis of other aetiologies. Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is an inherited disease that affects the lung and the liver. Carrying two severely dysfunctional copies of the alpha-1 antitrypsin gene may cause advanced chronic liver disease/cirrhosis. Affected individuals with a first complication of cirrhosis are more prone to developing further liver-related events (including multiorgan dysfunction) and requiring liver transplantation (which cures the inherited liver disease) compared to patients who have similarly advanced liver disease. These findings should prompt the development of disease-modifying treatments and early listing for liver transplantation."

    "title": "Molecular Advances in Cholestatic Liver Diseases.",
    "abstract": "The list of genetically defined causes of cholestatic liver diseases continues to expand; it currently includes mutations affecting bile acid synthesis, basolateral and apical membrane transporters, bile duct development, canalicular tight junctions, and bile acid conjugation, among others. The most frequently identified mutations in large multi-institutional studies of cholestasis occur in JAG1, ATP8B1, ABCB11, ABCB4, SERPINA1, and CFTR. Mutations in JAG1, SERPINA1, and CFTR cause Alagille syndrome, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, and cystic fibrosis, respectively. Mutations in ATP8B1, ABCB11, and ABCB4 cause a spectrum of diseases that range from the episodic, nonprogressive benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis and intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy to the severe and rapidly progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis. These cholestatic disorders present a wide range of symptoms and overlapping clinical features. However, in contemporary practice, diagnosis is often easily and rapidly established by clinically available comprehensive gene panels. In addition to diagnosis, these panels also aid in the discovery of novel genes or variants as potential causes of cholestasis. Genetic mutations may also be responsible for drug-induced cholestasis, as the liver plays a vital role in metabolism of drugs and xenobiotics. Uptake into hepatocytes and elimination into the bloodstream or bile of drugs and xenobiotics involve transporters across the basolateral and apical hepatocellular membranes, respectively. Therefore, mutations in any of the transporters lead to impaired metabolism and/or elimination of these substances. Furthermore, a large number of drugs and xenobiotics have a transcriptional or functional inhibitory effect on transporters such as BSEP and MDR3, setting the stage for the all-too-common drug-induced cholestasis."

    "title": "Can Proteomics Play a Significant Role in the Identification of Biomarkers for Alpha1-Antitrypsin Deficiency?",
    "abstract": "Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a common genetic disorder that can manifest in a broad spectrum of clinical symptoms, ranging from asymptomatic cases to severe, progressive systemic diseases, primarily affecting the lungs and liver. Despite its prevalence, AATD is often perceived as a rare condition, which can lead to a lack of awareness among primary care physicians and even some respiratory specialists. This misconception may result in missed opportunities for diagnosis, particularly in mild or asymptomatic patients. Consequently, it is vital for healthcare providers to familiarize themselves with the various presentations, diagnostic techniques, and management strategies for AATD. This review explores the current understanding of AATD, emphasizing the valuable role of liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry in identifying biomarkers that could enhance early diagnosis and help predict disease outcomes. As knowledge about the complexities of AATD continues to grow, physicians may begin to view the disorder not as a fatal pathology, but as a treatable inherited condition with the potential for improved management."

    "title": "Effect of Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency on Zinc Homeostasis Gene Regulation and Interaction with Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress Response-Associated Genes.",
    "abstract": "Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the <i>SERPINA1</i> gene, leading to reduced levels or impaired alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) function. This condition predominantly affects the lungs and liver. The Z allele, a specific mutation in the <i>SERPINA1</i> gene, is the most severe form and results in the production of misfolded AAT proteins. The misfolded proteins accumulate in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of liver cells, triggering ER stress and activating the unfolded protein response (UPR), a cellular mechanism designed to restore ER homeostasis. Currently, there is limited knowledge regarding specific nutritional recommendations for patients with AATD. The liver is essential for the regulation of zinc homeostasis, with zinc widely recognized for its hepatoprotective properties. However, the effects of AATD on zinc metabolism remain poorly understood. Similarly, the potential benefits of zinc supplementation for individuals with AATD have not been thoroughly investigated. This study explored the relationship between AATD and zinc metabolism through a combination of in vitro experiments and computational analysis. The expression of the mutant Z variant of ATT (ATZ) in cultured mouse hepatocytes was associated with decreased labile zinc levels in cells and dysregulation of zinc homeostasis genes. Analysis of two data series from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) revealed that mice expressing ATZ (PiZ mice), a murine model of AATD, exhibited significant differences in mRNA levels related to zinc homeostasis and UPR when compared to wildtype mice. Bayesian network analysis of GEO data uncovered novel gene-to-gene interactions among zinc transporters, as well as between zinc homeostasis, UPR, and other associated genes. The findings provide valuable insights into the role of zinc homeostasis genes in UPR processes linked to AATD."

    "title": "Clinical Utility of Non-Invasive Tests for Liver Fibrosis in People Living With Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency.",
    "abstract": "Severe alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a rare genetic condition characterised by low systemic levels of alpha-1 antitrypsin due to its retention in the liver. Consequently, it predisposes individuals to the development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and liver cirrhosis. Much progress has been made to non-invasively monitor liver fibrosis and cirrhosis in individuals with other liver diseases, but it remains unclear how to assess liver disease in people with AATD. This narrative review examined the available evidence on non-invasive tests (NITs) to stage liver fibrosis and predict incident major adverse liver outcomes in people with AATD. Liver stiffness measurement (LSM) using vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE), blood-based NITs, and serum liver enzymes are generally normal or mildly elevated in individuals with AATD. Further, VCTE-LSM and blood-based NITs, including the AST to platelet ratio index and fibrosis-4 score, have diagnostic utility for predicting F2 and F3 fibrosis and hold excellent (AUROC ≥ 0.90) prognostic value for incident major adverse liver outcomes. Gamma-glutamyl transferase also exhibits diagnostic and prognostic utility but is subject to multiple non-AATD-related fluctuations. A potential strategy to non-invasively assess liver disease stage and estimate the risk of major adverse liver outcomes in people with AATD could consist of a combination of VCTE-LSM with blood-based biomarker panels. Future studies should explore if liver stiffness naturally fluctuates over time in people with AATD, assess the ideal frequency of follow-up, and evaluate if NITs can guide the treatment of AATD-related liver disease."

    "abstract": "Pulmonary emphysema, a component of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterised by irreversible alveolar tissue destruction and is produced by an imbalance between proteolytic enzymes, mostly neutrophil elastase (NE), and its inhibitors, mainly alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT). We measured elastase-inhibitory activity (EIA) in serum samples and determined whether there is an association between EIA and COPD severity. This cross-sectional study recruited COPD patients with and without severe alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) and healthy controls. A semi-automated method assessed EIA using a porcine elastase inhibition assay. EIA levels and the EIA/AAT ratio were compared across groups and the correlation with clinical variables was analysed. A total of 86 individuals were recruited: 36 COPD patients, 20 individuals with COPD associated with AATD (Pi*ZZ mutation), of whom 11 were on augmentation therapy, and 30 healthy controls. Positive, linear and significant relationships were observed between EIA and AAT levels. The EIA/AAT ratio was higher in non AATD-related COPD patients compared to untreated Pi*ZZ patients and controls. Further analysis in non-AATD-related COPD patients revealed a higher EIA/AAT ratio associated with older age, higher comorbidity burden and a trend towards higher severity of lung disease. The strong correlation between AAT levels and EIA suggests that the assay technique employed is robust and effective for assessing EIA. The EIA assay may serve as a potential biomarker for the assessment of the severity and prognosis of emphysema."

    "abstract": "Alpha-1 antitrypsin (A1AT) deficiency (AATD) is caused by a mutation in the SERPINA1 gene (PiZ allele), where misfolded A1AT liver accumulation leads to liver damage, and A1AT deficiency in the lungs results in emphysema due to unregulated neutrophil elastase activity. Base editing offers a potential cure for A1AT; however, effective treatment is hindered by the absence of dual-target delivery systems that can target key tissues. We developed Dual Selective ORgan-Targeting lipid nanoparticles (SORT LNPs) to deliver base editors to the liver and lungs. Dual SORT LNPs correct the PiZ mutation, achieving 40% correction editing in liver cells and 10% in lung AT2 cells. The liver maintains stable editing for 32 weeks, reducing Z-A1AT levels by over 80% and restoring a normal liver phenotype. In parallel, 89% neutrophil elastase inhibition is achieved in lung bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Taken together, Dual SORT LNP therapy offers a promising approach for long-lasting genome correction for multi-organ diseases such as AATD."

    "abstract": "Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a prevalent genetic disorder in Europe causing hepatic fibrosis and often remains undiagnosed, even in severe cases requiring liver transplantation (LT). This study aimed to determine the frequency of pre-LT diagnosis amongst LT candidates with AATD and to describe their clinical characteristics. A secondary goal was to assess awareness and practices concerning AATD amongst LT specialists in France. This retrospective multicenter cohort study included LT candidates diagnosed with AATD based on PAS-positive staining of explanted livers (1995-2020) from nine centres in France and Canada. A 22-question survey was sent to LT specialists in France to assess AATD knowledge and practices. Amongst 58 patients diagnosed with AATD between 1996 and 2020, 40% were diagnosed pre-LT, 15% post-LT and 45% never confirmed. Less than 25% had non-specific pulmonary symptoms. The survey revealed poor awareness of AATD; 78% of specialists rated their knowledge as very low to moderate. Consistent pre-LT screening occurred in 59.3% of cases, and 52.5% recommended familial screening upon a confirmed diagnosis. AATD remains underdiagnosed in pre-LT assessments and is poorly understood amongst practitioners in France. Improved screening can enhance patient management, especially with emerging potentially curative treatments."

    "abstract": "C1 esterase inhibitor (C1INH) is a member of the serpin superfamily of proteins and controls plasma kallikrein (Pka). Purified C1INH concentrates are effective in controlling C1INH deficiency (hereditary angioedema, HAE). Because C1INH is a relatively slow inhibitor of Pka, we sought to develop a more effective inhibitor by exchanging reactive centre loop (RCL) residues in another serpin, alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) variant M358R, with the corresponding residues of C1INH. Novel, soluble, N-terminally hexahistidine-tagged variants were expressed in E. coli, purified by nickel chelate chromatography, and characterized kinetically. AAT/C1INH loop exchange mutants were designated by the RCL residues exchanged using the reactive centre P1-P1' convention. Maximal exchange mutant AC (10-4') inhibited Pka 78-fold and activated Factor XI (FXIa) 350-fold less rapidly than AAT M358R. Eleven additional variants were expressed, restoring AAT residues stepwise. The most selective variant was AC (10-3/4'), which restored AAT residues from P2-P3' compared to AC (10-4'), and inhibited Pka 1.9-fold more rapidly, and FXIa 1.6-fold less rapidly, for a gain in selectivity of 2.8-fold (p < 0.0001), without increasing the stoichiometry of inhibition (SI). The most active variant was AC (10-3), in which both the rate of Pka and FXIa inhibition were elevated relative to AAT M358R values, without SI elevation. Other variants exhibited slower reaction rates and/or elevated SI values. These results indicate that RCL exchanges can be productively employed to change serpin specificity and selectivity, but that the most effective exchanges may not be contiguous due to cooperativity between RCL residues."

Because there are no established tools for early detection of individuals at risk for liver-related death (LRD), we analyzed LRD predictors in the UK Biobank (UKB) data and validated the usefulness of serum insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1). The UKB dataset encompassing 325,981 participants, a median follow-up of 13.5 years, and 846 LRDs was used as a training cohort. IGF-1 was validated in several independent cohorts of different liver disease etiologies and fibrosis stages. A Cox proportional hazard model was used to develop the gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT)-IGF-1 score that was validated in an independent UKB cohort with 83,528 subjects and 237 LRDs. Among 59 variables in the UKB training cohort, GGT and IGF-1 were identified as the LRD predictors with time-dependent area under the curve (AUROC) >80%. Phenome-wide association study demonstrated the higher liver specificity of IGF-1 compared with GGT. In validation cohorts, IGF-1 levels: (1) increased in subjects with alcohol misuse after alcohol detoxification; (2) were reduced in individuals with alcohol-related/steatotic liver disease or severe alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency and higher fibrosis stages; and (3) were diminished in participants with more advanced liver cirrhosis and lower levels associated with higher mortality. In the UKB training and validation cohorts, the novel GGT-IGF-1 score achieved an AUROC of 0.87 for LRD and was significantly better than established risk scores (AUROC = 0.77-0.81). The study highlights the usefulness of IGF-1 as a reliable predictor of LRD and identifies a novel, population-based screening tool outperforming the currently used scores."

    "abstract": "Although several SERPINA1 genetic variants have been reported for their pathogenicity to induce liver disorders through phenotype-driven approaches, data regarding genotype-driven approaches of the SERPINA1 locus remain unavailable. This study aimed to characterize the clinical and liver biological profiles of patients harboring nonbenign SERPINA1 variants. We conducted a retrospective, exome-based genotype-first reverse phenotyping study using structured electronic health record data from consecutive patients from January 1, 2015, to January 31, 2022. Statistical associations were assessed using frequentist and Bayesian models, with validation in the UK Biobank cohort. Among 1377 patients analyzed, 15 SERPINA1 variants classified as nonbenign were identified in 217 (15.7%) patients. Data were available for 126 patients (median age, 41.5 years; 52.4% male). Liver disease, hyperferritinemia, and pulmonary emphysema were observed in 32.5% (41/126), 23% (29/126), and 5.6% (7/126) of the patients, respectively. The median follow-up duration was 1.3 years and encompassed 1085 biological observations. We confirmed associations with well-documented variants of SERPINA1 (p.Glu366Lys, p.Pro393Ser, p.Ala308Ser, p.Glu288Val, and p.Phe76del). We identified three novel genetic associations with liver markers: c.*10G > A, c.1065 + 10C > T, and p.Arg63Cys. The UK Biobank data confirmed significant gene- and variant-level associations, notably for the variants identified in our study, which ranked in the top decile of statistical associations. This study supports the utility of a genotype-first approach in characterizing hepatic manifestations of nonbenign SERPINA1 variants. The findings highlight novel genotype-biomarker associations and suggest a role for SERPINA1 genetic testing in patients with unexplained liver abnormalities."

It is a multistep process that is tightly regulated by nutrient, energy, and stress-sensing mechanisms. Autophagy plays a pivotal role in various biological processes, including protein and organelle quality control, defense against pathogen infections, cell metabolism, and immune surveillance. As a result, autophagy dysfunction is linked to a variety of pathological conditions. The role of autophagy in cancer is complex and dynamic. Depending on the context, autophagy can have both tumor-suppressive and pro-tumorigenic effects. In contrast, its role is more clearly defined in protein conformational disorders, where autophagy serves as a mechanism to reduce toxic protein aggregation, thereby improving cellular homeostasis. Because autophagy-based therapies hold promising potential for the treatment of cancer and protein conformational disorders, this review will highlight the latest findings and advancements in these areas."

Twelve pregnant dams underwent volume-matched intra-amniotic injections in all their fetuses (n = 139) of either a suspension of human AAT (hAAT) mRNA encapsulated by a synthetic cationic polymer-based composite, lipopolyplex (mRNA group; n = 99) or of lipopolyplex free of mRNA (controls; n = 40), on gestational day 17 (E17; term = E21). Fetal lung and liver samples were procured daily thereafter until term to screen for hAAT by ELISA. Liver function panels were performed at term. Statistical analysis included median regression (p < 0.05). Fetal survival was 79% (110/139), significantly higher in the mRNA group (p = 0.012). Controlled by mRNA-free injections, hAAT was found in the fetal lungs at all time points (p = 0.005 to < 0.001) but in the liver only at E20, suggesting interspecies homology manifesting at that site. The term liver function panels were comparable between groups. Encapsulated exogenous mRNA encoding for human alpha-1 antitrypsin protein can be incorporated and translated by fetal lung cells following simple intra-amniotic injection in a healthy rat model. Fetal hepatic incorporation and translation remain to be determined in a model with minimal to no human homology. Transamniotic mRNA delivery could become a novel strategy for the perinatal management of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency."

While the PiZZ genotype is well characterized, the clinical and structural progression of PiSZ individuals remains less defined. This study evaluates genotype-specific disease trajectories and the impact of augmentation therapy over a two-year follow-up. A prospective observational cohort study was conducted, including 74 AATD patients (41 PiSZ, 33 PiZZ), stratified by augmentation therapy status. Disease progression was assessed through lung function decline (forced expiratory volume in one second [FEV1], diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide [DLCO], carbon monoxide transfer coefficient [KCO]) and densitometric changes (15th percentile lung density [PD-15], percentage of lung voxels below -950 Hounsfield units [HU-950]). Mixed-effects models and multivariable regression analyses were performed to evaluate genotype-specific progression patterns and treatment effects. Results: PiZZ individuals exhibited significantly greater annual decline in lung function and densitometric parameters compared to PiSZ individuals, with more pronounced loss in basal lung regions and with greater decline in advanced stages, in contrast to the PiSZ genotype, which showed greater progression in earlier stages. Augmentation therapy was associated with a significant reduction in PD-15 decline in both genotypes, with the greatest benefit observed in PiZZ patients and in those diagnosed within five years of disease onset. Smoking and frequent exacerbations were identified as independent risk factors for accelerated disease progression. PiZZ individuals experience a more aggressive disease trajectory than PiSZ individuals in the absence of treatment. Augmentation therapy effectively mitigates disease progression in both genotypes, with greater efficacy when initiated early. Smoking and frequent exacerbations were identified as independent risk factors for accelerated disease progression. These findings underscore the importance of genotype-specific monitoring and personalized therapeutic strategies in AATD to optimize clinical outcomes."

This study examines the genetic and clinical profiles of neonates with cholestasis, focusing on genotype-phenotype correlations and diagnostic outcomes. A retrospective review of children with neonatal cholestasis treated between 1997 and 2024 was conducted. Extrahepatic causes were excluded, and genetic testing, including a targeted cholestasis panel and whole exome sequencing (WES), was employed. Clinical and biochemical data, including gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) levels, were collected. Genetic disorders were identified in 28.0% of 378 cases, including mutations in ATP8B1, ABCB11, ABCB4, DCDC2, DGUOK, KIF12, USP53, and genes related to bile acid synthesis (HSD3B7, PEX1). GGT levels played a significant role in diagnosis: patients with low or normal GGT were frequently diagnosed with progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC)1 and 2, or bile acid synthesis defects, while high GGT levels were associated with PFIC3, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, and cystic fibrosis. Consanguinity was noted in 56.0% of genetically diagnosed cases. After 2010, 35.5% of patients received a genetic diagnosis, compared to 18.2% before 2010. Genetic diseases are a major cause of neonatal cholestasis, and GGT levels serve as a useful diagnostic tool in differentiating subtypes. The increasing availability of genetic testing has improved early diagnosis and personalised management. Expanded genetic testing in clinical practice is critical for timely and accurate diagnosis of these rare disorders."

    "abstract": "Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is the most common genetic cause of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but considerable phenotypic variability exists among affected individuals who share disease-causing variants. Therefore, a multi-center longitudinal cohort study of 270 adult participants with PiZZ AATD will be established with goal of examining how computed tomography (CT) imaging and serum and airway biomarkers can be used to explain differences in phenotypic manifestations and outcomes. Study visits at enrollment, 18 months and 36 months will obtain spirometry, patient-reported outcomes and biosampling from blood, nasal mucosa and sputum. Chest CT image acquisition will be utilized for whole lung and lobar estimations of emphysema based on lung density and to test novel measurements of airway remodeling and lung tissue mechanics. Dried blood spot cards will be collected if the participant experiences an acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD) during the study. Genetic analysis will be performed with complete SERPINA1 sequencing, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) will be isolated to generate a repository of inducible pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). The cohort will be deeply characterized including imaging, physiology, and symptomatology cross-sectionally and longitudinally over a 3-year follow-up period. A validation cohort from Ireland will independently enroll patients with identical procedures. This is the first cohort of AATD to incorporate such detailed metrics of disease including quantitative emphysema measures with the overarching goal of improving the understanding of disease heterogeneity in AATD and identifying factors associated with disease severity and progression."

    "abstract": "The PI*Mmalton variant is a rare form of alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency, caused by a mutation in the SERPINA1 gene and associated with reduced AAT levels. Its clinical significance remains uncertain due to the limited number of reported cases. This study characterizes PI*Mmalton carriers within the EARCO (European Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Research Collaboration) registry and compares them with PI*ZZ individuals. Patients were categorized into moderate PI*Mmalton (combined with PI*S or PI*I) and severe PI*Mmalton (combined with PI*Z, PI*Mmalton, PI*MProcida, or PI*MHerleen). Demographic data, lung function, respiratory symptoms, disease prevalence, and augmentation therapy use were analyzed. Among 2074 individuals, 59 (2.8%) carried a PI*Mmalton allele. Severe PI*Mmalton patients exhibited lung function impairment comparable to PI*ZZ individuals, with a significantly lower FEV₁/FVC ratio (55.9% vs. 57.6%) and similar AAT levels (~ 25 mg/dL). Moderate PI*Mmalton patients had better lung function and higher AAT levels (median 54 mg/dL). Emphysema was more prevalent in severe PI*Mmalton (54.5%) and PI*ZZ (61.2%) than in moderate PI*Mmalton (34.6%). Augmentation therapy use was highest in severe PI*Mmalton (45.2%). Liver disease prevalence was comparable across groups. Severe PI*Mmalton patients exhibit clinical and functional similarities to PI*ZZ individuals, suggesting a comparable disease burden. Moderate PI*Mmalton patients, however, show milder impairment. These findings reinforce the need for genotype-specific management strategies and suggest that PI*Mmalton carriers, particularly those with severe variants, should be considered in future clinical trials."

    "abstract": "Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (A1ATD) is an inherited metabolic disorder caused by a mutation (ZZ) in the SERPINA1 gene. Carriers are predisposed to liver and lung pathology. The severity of A1ATD-associated liver disease is highly variable, necessitating further characterisation. This study aims to investigate the risk and extent of liver disease and the prevalence of liver transplantation in ZZ A1ATD patients. Several established databases, including Ovid, EBSCO, PubMed, and Cochrane Library, were searched from inception to May 12, 2024. Data were pooled using a random effects model, and study weight was calculated using the inverse variance method. Crude odds ratios (cOR) were calculated using participants with the MM genotype as the comparator. The study was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42022335666). Of the 4420 studies identified, 45 studies and 8638 A1ATD patients (38.8% female) were included. ZZ A1ATD patients demonstrate an increased risk of liver diseases compared to controls, including steatosis (crude odds ratio (cOR): 1.52 [95% CI: 1.21, 1.91]), fibrosis (cOR: 9.85 [95% CI: 5.70, 17.03]), cirrhosis (cOR: 10.43 [95% CI: 5.51, 19.73]), and liver cancers (cOR: 14.12 [95% CI: 6.50, 30.66]). The prevalence of liver transplantation is considerable, with rates reaching 5% [95% CI: 0.00, 12.34]. Our findings confirm the substantial burden of liver disease in ZZ A1ATD patients, including subclinical manifestations such as steatosis and fibrosis that may remain undetected. Given the lack of approved treatments for A1ATD-associated liver disease, prioritising the development of novel therapies to stop or reverse liver disease is essential."

We use spatial proteomics by mass spectrometry and machine learning to map AATD in human liver tissue. Combining Deep Visual Proteomics (DVP) with single-cell analysis<sup>4,5</sup>, we probe intact patient biopsies to resolve molecular events during hepatocyte stress in pseudotime across fibrosis stages. We achieve proteome depth of up to 4,300 proteins from one-third of a single cell in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue. This dataset reveals a potentially clinically actionable peroxisomal upregulation that precedes the canonical unfolded protein response. Our single-cell proteomics data show α1-antitrypsin accumulation is largely cell-intrinsic, with minimal stress propagation between hepatocytes. We integrated proteomic data with artificial intelligence-guided image-based phenotyping across several disease stages, revealing a late-stage hepatocyte phenotype characterized by globular protein aggregates and distinct proteomic signatures, notably including elevated TNFSF10 (also known as TRAIL) amounts. This phenotype may represent a critical disease progression stage. Our study offers new insights into AATD pathogenesis and introduces a powerful methodology for high-resolution, in situ proteomic analysis of complex tissues. This approach holds potential to unravel molecular mechanisms in various protein misfolding disorders, setting a new standard for understanding disease progression at the single-cell level in human tissue."

    "abstract": "Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) constitutes an inborn disorder arising due to mutations in alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT), a secreted protease inhibitor produced primarily in hepatocytes. It leads to diminished serum AAT levels, and this loss-of-function predisposes to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lung emphysema. The characteristic Pi*Z mutation results in hepatic Z-AAT accumulation. In its homozygous form (Pi*ZZ genotype), it is responsible for the majority of severe AATD cases and can cause both pediatric and adult liver disease, while the heterozygous form (Pi*MZ) is considered a disease modifier that becomes apparent primarily in the presence of other comorbidities or risk factors. In the current review, we collate conditions associated with AATD, introduce typical AAT variants, and discuss our understanding of disease pathogenesis. We present both cross-sectional and longitudinal data informing about the natural disease history and noninvasive tools that can be used for disease stratification as well as a basis for disease monitoring. Given that AATD-associated liver disease is highly heterogeneous, we discuss the risk factors affecting disease progression. While the loss-of-function lung disease is treated by weekly intravenous administration of purified AAT, recombinant modified AAT and oral protease inhibitors are currently in clinical trials. Among the liver candidates, small interfering RNA fazirsiran efficiently suppresses AAT production and is currently in phase 3 clinical trial, while several other genetic approaches, such as RNA editing, are at earlier stages. In summary, AATD represents a systemic disorder increasingly seen in the hepatologic routine and requiring thorough interdisciplinary care, since the currently ongoing clinical trials often address only one of the organs it affects."

Current guide RNA (gRNA) designs feature a fully complementary specificity domain with an A-C mismatch at the targeted adenosine. However, perfectly matched dsRNA is not the most effective ADAR substrate. Here we introduce MIRROR (mimicking inverted repeats to recruit ADARs using engineered oligoribonucleotides), an approach that implements structural motifs derived from highly edited inverted Alu repeats in human tissues to enable rational gRNA design for ADAR recruitment. We demonstrated that MIRROR is applicable to both short chemically synthesized gRNAs with modifications and long biologically generated gRNAs and surpasses current state-of-the-art approaches in both gRNA forms. It enhances editing efficiency by up to 5.7-fold in multiple human cell types and primary hepatocytes from an alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency mouse model. Our findings improve programmable RNA editing in vitro and in vivo by rational design through the screening of highly edited natural substrate mimics."

Our case report describes a patient with minimally symptomatic chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with AATD, diagnosed in large part due to the patient detecting nocturnal hypoxaemia on her smartwatch. This highlights the emerging role of patient-initiated wearable health technology in diagnosing clinical conditions before traditional symptoms are significant, thus opening another potential avenue for bridging the gap between documented cases of AATD and the estimated prevalence."

In emphysema, the loss of lung elastic recoil and airway obstruction leads to air trapping and lung hyperinflation. Remodeling of the thoracic cavity (\"barrel chest\") develops, which has implications for donor-to-recipient sizing and postoperative management of lung transplantation. We discuss the physiology of a relatively undersized allograft and the impact on chest tube, mechanical ventilation, and respiratory system mechanics management. This case also illustrates how chronic adaptations of the ventilatory pattern to advanced lung diseases are reversible and the chest cavity size can remodel back to normal after lung transplantation."

However, for those who require a lung transplant (LT), there is currently only limited information to guide the use of AAT augmentation therapy post-LT. We identified all LT recipients from 2011-2021 in the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients with an AAT deficiency diagnosis. We categorized recipients by use of AAT augmentation therapy post-LT and compared their baseline characteristics using Fisher's exact test and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. We used Kaplan-Meier analyses and estimated the average treatment effect (ATE) of post-LT AAT augmentation therapy on mortality and all-cause graft failure (ACGF). The ATE measures the observed effect we would see if everyone in the population received the intervention as opposed to just a subset. Among the 447 recipients with AAT deficiency, 109 used AAT augmentation therapy pre-LT, of which 32 (29.4%) continued post-LT. Recipients who used augmentation therapy post-LT were younger (56.5 [53-59.75] vs 57 [53.75-63], <i>p</i> = 0.04) and had shorter ischemia time (mean 311 vs 363 minutes, <i>p</i> = 0.03) than those who did not. The age-adjusted ATE estimate of post-LT augmentation therapy use on time to death and ACGF was +1.69 and +1.48 years, respectively. Post-LT augmentation therapy use was associated with a mortality reduction in the top quartile bilirubin subgroup (<i>p</i> = 0.02, log-rank test).

    "abstract": "Monogenetic disease alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is the leading cause of emphysema, which is a major life-limiting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The current standard of care for severely affected individuals with lung disease is the periodic intravenous infusion of human AAT protein to restore circulating AAT levels to a protective level, known as augmentation therapy. We did a systematic review to see the effect of gene therapy as a potential therapeutic option for AATD-related lung diseases. MEDLINE (via PubMed), SCOPUS, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and EMBASE have been searched following PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome) criteria. After duplication removal, abstract and title screening, full-text screening was done by two individual reviewers. Then, the data were extracted, tabulated, and analyzed. A total of 1094 articles were found in the primary search. After a comprehensive review following strict inclusion and exclusion criteria, 14 articles have been included in the review. Evidence shows the response of gene therapy depends on multiple factors, e.g., what vector is used, route of therapy administration, duration of therapy, etc. The AAV8-CASI-luc vector, delivered intratracheally (IT), achieved sustained lung transgene expression for at least 52 weeks, but 29% of mice had persistent expression up to 72 weeks, providing therapeutic AAT protein levels, reducing experimental emphysema severity in mice. Intratracheal AAV8 in mice showed the highest AAT expression in the lung, outperforming AAV9, AAV5, AAV2, and AAV2 capsid mutants, providing long-term expression up to 4 months. Intrapleural administration of AAV5-hA1AT achieved higher lung and serum A1AT levels than intramuscular delivery, with AAV5 yielding 10 times higher levels than AAV2. Gene therapy using viral vectors has a potential role in producing AAT protein, which can be beneficial for AATD-related lung diseases. Human trials are necessary to establish the effectiveness and safety of gene therapy. In conclusion, while initial studies are encouraging, more research is needed to confirm the role of gene therapy."

Of these, Geller syndrome is a rare variant of mineralocorticoid receptor that leads to concomitant hypokalemia and gestational hypertension. Progesterone has been shown to have a high affinity for the mineralocorticoid receptor and thus antagonizes aldosterone functioning. However, in Geller syndrome, there is a mutation of the mineralocorticoid receptor with a resultant gain of function. Activation of the mutated receptor is characterized by hypertension and hypokalemia, which is exacerbated by the effect of progesterone and thereby presenting during pregnancy. Genetic testing can confirm the diagnosis of Geller syndrome. The management is supportive therapy and requires close monitoring of the patient and her fetus. Delivery of the fetus results in the resolution of both hypertension and hypokalemia.

    "abstract": "Patients suffering from emphysema associated with alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency can benefit from augmentation therapy. AAT is administered to the patient once a week via intravenous infusion by a healthcare professional. However, only 2 % of the AAT dose reaches the lungs following intravenous infusion. Inhalation of AAT might be a convenient and effective alternative to intravenous infusion. Yet, it has shown limited therapeutic efficacy in a recent clinical trial. Here, we assessed the impact of these routes of AAT administration on AAT pharmacokinetics, lung distribution and therapeutic efficacy in mice. PEGylation of the serpin was employed to improve its therapeutic value. Intravenous injection of AAT or its local administration to the lungs resulted in a similar exposure of AAT in the lung parenchyma with however an AAT dose delivered to the lungs 45 times lower than the injected dose. Conjugation of AAT to a 2-armed 40 kDa polyethylene glycol (PEG) chain prolonged its half-life in plasma and lungs by 1.6-times, decreased its penetration in the lung tissue by both routes of administration but did not markedly affect the lung exposure to AAT. The PEG moiety in PEG-AAT was cleared more slowly than the protein moiety and high PEG quantities remained in the lung tissue and alveolar macrophages several days after intratracheal instillation. Pulmonary administration and PEGylation both improved AAT efficacy to prevent lung injury and inflammation in a murine model of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease where lung inflammation was induced by delivering porcine pancreatic elastase and lipopolysaccharide locally to the airways. Anti-AAT and anti-PEG antibodies were generated by AAT and PEG-AAT administration, as expected for a foreign protein. However, anti-PEG antibodies did not significantly contribute to the overall anti-drug antibody titers against the conjugate. AAT and PEG-AAT showed good stability to jet nebulization. This study provides new insights into the impact of administration route and PEGylation on lung exposure, clearance, therapeutic efficacy, and safety of AAT. It highlights that inhalation of AAT might effectively replace its intravenous infusion in augmentation therapy."

The study also explores correlations between functional and densitometric measures, as well as regional emphysema patterns. <b>Methods:</b> This two-year observational study included 31 PiSZ AATD patients stratified by time since diagnosis (<5 vs. ≥5 years), smoking status (current, former, and never smokers), and exacerbation frequency (<2 vs. ≥2 exacerbations/year). Functional [forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), carbon monoxide diffusion (DLCO), and carbon monoxide transfer coefficient (KCO)] and densitometric [15th percentile lung density (PD-15) and lung volume with density less than -950 Hounsfield Units (HU-950)] parameters were assessed at baseline and follow-up. Mixed-effects models evaluated disease progression, while correlation and regional analyses highlighted structural-functional relationships and spatial emphysema patterns. <b>Results:</b> Patients diagnosed <5 years previously exhibited faster PD-15 decline (-6.0 ± 1.4 HU/year) than those diagnosed ≥5 years previously (-5.1 ± 1.3 HU/year; <i>p</i> < 0.05). Current smokers showed the most pronounced deterioration in PD-15 (-7.1 ± 1.6 HU/year) and HU-950 (+0.8 ± 0.3% volume/year) versus never smokers (-4.6 ± 1.3 HU/year and +0.4 ± 0.2% volume/year; <i>p</i> < 0.05). Frequent and severe exacerbations, along with pulmonary-related hospitalizations, worsened structural decline, particularly in basal regions. Strong correlations between both PD-15 and HU-950 with FEV1, DLCO, and KCO were observed in advanced stages (≥5 years since diagnosis). <b>Conclusions:</b> This study underscores the pivotal role of densitometry in PiSZ AATD, highlighting its ability to detect early structural changes often missed by functional measures.

This retrospective observational study included patients and gamete donors attending a Human Fertility Institute in Colombia between January 2017 and June 2023. Sociodemographic data and results of Next Generation Sequencing laboratory panels for screening of recessive disease-causing mutations were collected and analyzed. Data from 746 samples were analyzed; 599 (80.3%) were Colombian origin individuals and 147 (19.7%) were foreigners. At least one mutation was detected in 526 (70.5%) individuals. Of note, 893 pathogenic genetic variants were identified.The genetic variants most frequently observed in all the individuals studied were associated with the following diseases (carrier frequency): alpha thalassemia (10.5%), alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (10%), congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency (9.4%), cystic fibrosis (7.3%), spinal muscular atrophy type 1 (5.6%) and Stargardt disease type 1 (5.0%). The most frequent genetic variant observed in the subgroup of Colombian origin individuals was associated with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (11.3%). Information on the frequency of recessive diseases in Colombia is limited. This pioneering carrier genetic screening identified a high percentage of carriers for at least one recessive autosomal or X-linked in the population evaluated. Screening for recessive mutations could lead to an evolution in family planning programs and a decrease in the number of patients affected by recessive disorders. Furthermore, it could become a routine test not only in cases of assisted reproduction but also in cases of natural gestation."

    "title": "Patient experience of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency-associated liver disease: a qualitative study.",
    "abstract": "To elicit the signs and/or symptoms, and impacts on daily living experienced by patients with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency-associated liver disease (AATD-LD). A preliminary \"concept list\" of signs and/or symptoms, and impacts was developed from a targeted literature review, patient blog posts, and clinician interviews. Subsequently, one-to-one concept elicitation interviews involving English-speaking, US adults with AATD-LD and a protease inhibitor (Pi) ZZ or MZ genotype were conducted by trained interviewers following a central Institutional Review Board-approved discussion guide. An AATD-LD conceptual model was developed based on these findings. Concepts were \"most salient\" if reported by ≥ 8 patients with a mean bothersomeness/disturbance rating of ≥ 5, or \"highly salient\" if reported by > 5- < 8 patients with a mean bothersomeness/disturbance rating of ≥ 5 (scale: 0-10, 0: not at all bothersome/disturbing; 10: extremely bothersome/disturbing). Fifteen patients were interviewed (median [range] age: 57 [28-78] years; Pi*ZZ, n = 12; Pi*MZ, n = 3). Of 41 signs and/or symptoms, the most salient were fatigue/tiredness, respiratory infections, shortness of breath, confusion/difficulty concentrating, and edema. Highly salient signs and/or symptoms were abdominal swelling, acid reflux, sleep disturbance, vomiting, abdominal pain/tenderness, itchiness, and back pain. Of 16 impacts, the most salient were on work and employment, leisure activities, and relationships. Impacts on mobility were highly salient. Several concepts were frequently reported as moderately/highly bothersome/disturbing. Further investigation of the experience of patients with AATD-LD in a large, diverse population across all fibrosis stages and genotypes is warranted. Clinical outcome assessments that capture salient concepts are needed."

    "abstract": "The severe alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) genotype Pi*ZZ increases the risk of liver disease (AATD-LD) and lung disease. While non-invasive tests (NITs) are widely used for fibrosis stage and monitoring of all liver diseases, the consensus for use in AATD-LD is limited. A Delphi panel study was conducted to address this need. Healthcare providers who managed at least two patients with AATD-LD in the past two years participated. Two iterative surveys were developed and administered. The second survey clarified the results from the first and provided deeper feedback. As follow-up, a real-time consensus-building exercise focused on survey topics without consensus. Controlled feedback was anonymous. A total of 20 AATD experts (hepatology [n = 9], pulmonology [n = 6], transplant hepatology [n = 3], gastroenterology [n = 1], and hepatology and transplant hepatology [n = 1]) completed the study. A strong consensus was achieved around the use and evaluation of NITs for risk stratification and monitoring. All panelists agreed that vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE) is the preferred NIT for the initial assessment of AATD-LD owing to its accessibility and reliability. Magnetic resonance elastography and enhanced liver fibrosis tests were also considered valuable. Most (85%) agreed that VCTE < 8 kPa could indicate no or mild fibrosis and VCTE ≥ 8 kPa could indicate clinically significant fibrosis, which may correspond to fibrosis stage ≥ F2 on the METAVIR scale. Most (85%) agreed that VCTE ≥ 13 kPa may indicate cirrhosis. Utilizing the Delphi technique, this study identified a clinically applicable framework for the diagnosis and monitoring of AATD-LD. A high level of agreement emerged regarding preferred NITs and their usage, risk stratification and monitoring in the context of AATD-LD management. The results provide a foundation for future efforts into NIT validation and the development of clinical guidelines for AATD-LD."

    "abstract": "Severe alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a known risk factor for early development of emphysema and COPD. By the Swedish national screening program within the years 1972-74 a cohort of individuals with severe AATD (PiZZ) was identified and regularly followed up. The aim of this study was to investigate alveolar volume (V<sub>A</sub>) and the ratio V<sub>A</sub>/Total lung capacity (V<sub>A</sub>/TLC) for the detection of signs of hyperinflation and ventilation heterogeneity in PiZZ individuals compared with an age-matched control group (phenotype PiMM), randomly selected from the population registry. All study participants underwent pulmonary function tests (PFT) including dynamic spirometry and total lung capacity (TLC), residual volume (RV), functional residual capacity (FRC) and alveolar volume (V<sub>A</sub>). They answered a questionnaire on smoking habits and symptoms. Quality of life was assessed by answering the Saint George´s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). Fifty-six PiZZ and 66 PiMM individuals participated in the study. The PiZZ individuals had a significantly lower V<sub>A</sub>/TLC ratio (p=0.004) and significantly higher RV (p<0.001) and RV/TLC ratio (p=0.001) than the PiMM individuals. The 13 PiZZ ever-smokers had a significantly higher TLC (p=0.025), RV (p=0.003) and FRC (p=0.003) and a significantly lower V<sub>A</sub>/TLC ratio (p=0.006) than the 24 PiMM ever-smokers. No significant differences in RV, TLC, V<sub>A</sub>, and V<sub>A</sub>/TLC ratio were found between the never-smoking PiZZ and PiMM individuals. The ratio RV/TLC was significantly higher in the PiZZ never-smokers than in the PiMM never-smokers (p=0.026). At the age of 42 the PiZZ ever-smokers have signs of hyperinflation and ventilation heterogeneity."

    "abstract": "Somatic variants accumulate in non-malignant tissues with age. Functional variants, leading to clonal advantage of hepatocytes, accumulate in the liver of patients with acquired chronic liver disease (CLD). Whether somatic variants are common to CLD from differing etiologies is unknown. We analyzed liver somatic variants in patients with genetic CLD from alpha-1 antitrypsin (A1AT) deficiency or hemochromatosis. We show that somatic variants in SERPINA1, the gene encoding A1AT, are strongly selected for in A1AT deficiency, with evidence of convergent evolution. Acquired SERPINA1 variants are clustered at the carboxyl terminus of A1AT, leading to truncation. In vitro and in vivo, C-terminal truncation variants reduce disease-associated Z-A1AT polymer accumulation and disruption of the endoplasmic reticulum, supporting the C-terminal domain swap mechanism. Therefore, somatic escape variants from a deleterious germline variant are selected for in A1AT deficiency, suggesting that functional somatic variants are disease-specific in CLD and point to disease-associated mechanisms."

    "abstract": "Pulmonary exacerbations in alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) are associated with worse disease outcomes, including accelerated lung function decline. As with non-deficient COPD, subjects with AATD are predisposed to bacterial colonisation of the lower respiratory tract, a known risk factor for exacerbations. Despite this, the extent to which colonising bacteria contribute to exacerbations remains relatively unexplored. Sputum samples were collected longitudinally from AATD subjects, when clinically stable and during exacerbations, and were processed for quantitative culture to identify bacterial pathogens. Using contemporaneous clinical data, a post-hoc analysis was performed to calculate the odds of an exacerbation in the presence of recognised, potentially pathogenic bacteria (PPB) of the lower respiratory tract. 324 sputum samples were collected from 29 patients with AATD plus radiological evidence of bronchiectasis and 671 samples from 62 patients without bronchiectasis (AATD alone). Both groups contained patients with AATD-associated lung disease (emphysema and chronic bronchitis). At least half of the samples (55.5 %) from AATD alone were positive for a PPB and almost three quarters (72.8 %) of those with bronchiectasis. Presence of a Pseudomonas species, Staphylococcus aureus or Moraxella catarrhalis during stable state disease were all significantly associated with increased likelihood of a subsequent exacerbation (OR: 1.89, p = 0.0013; 1.98, 0.0022; 1.98, 0.0047; 2.19, 0.0047, respectively), independent of age, sex, disease severity (FEV1 impairment), smoking status and presence or absence of bronchiectasis. Disease progression in AATD is variable and identification of traits which may contribute may prove influential. Here, we report that bacterial colonisation is an important predictor of exacerbation in AATD, likely attributed to the associated levels of increased inflammation. Thereby, this may represent a sub cohort of patients that could benefit from additional, targeted therapy."

    "abstract": "Neutrophilic inflammation and a high level of free α-defensins are main features of chronic airway inflammation in alpha-1 antitrypsin-deficient (AATD) individuals. Despite the antimicrobial activities of α-defensins by direct bacterial killing and by modulation of immune responses, AATD individuals are paradoxically burdened by recurrent exacerbation triggered by bacterial infections, frequently with nontypeable <i>Haemophilus influenzae</i> (NTHi). Previous studies demonstrated that high, rather than low α-defensin level could modulate the local pro-inflammatory milieu of bronchial epithelial cells and macrophages promoting chronic inflammation and lower pathogen phagocytosis. IgG-mediated phagocytosis and NTHi adherence, engulfment and phagocytosis were measured in human alveolar macrophages and monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) isolated from patients with AATD and from healthy individuals. A high concentration of free α-defensins induced NTHi adherence to MDMs but decreased IgG-mediated phagocytosis by MDMs. The decreased phagocytosis was associated with TLR4 activation, downstream signaling via NF-κB p65 and marked increased secretion of inflammatory cytokines, CXCL8, IL-1b, and TNFα by the α-defensin-treated and NTHi-infected MDMs. Exogenous AAT treatment and TLR4 inhibitor decreased TNFα expression in α-defensin-treated cells. Dampening the downstream effects of a high concentration of α-defensins may render AAT and TLR4 inhibitors as potential therapies to decrease NTHi colonization and increase its clearance by phagocytosis in AATD individuals."

PLCs are composed of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), and mixed HCC-CCA, accounting for 85 %, 10 %, and 5 % of cases, respectively. Among the numerous identified risk factors associated with liver cancers, Alpha 1-AntiTrypsin Deficiency (AATD) genetic disease emerges as an intriguing one. AATD-related liver disease may lead to chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and PLCs in adulthood. Although our knowledge about the natural history of AATD-liver disease has improved recently, liver cancers associated with AATD remain poorly understood and explored, while this specific population is at a 20 to 50 times higher risk of developing PLC. Thus, we review here current knowledge about AATD-associated PLCs, describing the impact of AATD genotypes on their occurrence. We also discuss emerging hypotheses regarding the AATD PiZZ genotype-related hepatic carcinogenesis process. Finally, we perform an updated analysis of the United Kingdom Biobank database that highlights and confirms AATD PiZZ genotype as an important HCC risk factor."

Three cohorts included individuals with evidence of AATD; individuals with COPD + AATD matched to individuals with COPD; and individuals with newly diagnosed COPD. AATD health-related outcomes, such as pulmonary and extrapulmonary conditions or events, and economic outcomes, including inpatient admissions, emergency department visits, and physician visits, were examined independently during the pre-index and post-index periods and compared between those with ATTD and without AATD. <b>Results:</b> We identified 1103 individuals with AATD (aged 67.2 ± 10.0 years, 56.3% women, 94.5% White); overall, 22.2% had exacerbations, respiratory distress, and respiratory failure. Individuals with COPD and AATD (n = 742) were matched to individuals with COPD (n = 7420), based on age (68 ± 9 years), sex (55.0% women), and race (97.2% White).

    "abstract": "Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a genetic disorder that can result in a range of illnesses, with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) being one of the most common. Although some people obtain genetic testing that identifies AATD, many people are unaware that they have AATD until they develop COPD, often at a younger age than is typical. Treatment for AATD consists primarily of augmentation with AAT, requiring weekly infusions of blood products for most patients. This treatment can slow disease progression and improve symptoms, but is burdensome; thus, people with AATD could benefit from additional or alternate treatments. However, to guide the development of new treatments, researchers need to identify which outcomes matter to people with AATD. We conducted a scoping literature review to better understand patient experiences with AATD and its treatment and identify patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) used to assess symptoms and impacts in studies of people with AATD. The review identified 44 concepts related to symptoms and disease burden, grouped into six domains (symptoms, physical function, cognitive function, emotional function, psychosocial function, and treatment burden) and 24 PROMs that have been used in research on AATD. None of the identified measures were developed specifically for people with AATD. Research on patient-focused outcomes was limited, suggesting a significant gap in knowledge. People with AATD experience a variety of disease-related burdens, but this study showed there is a lack of published, in-depth studies to support selection and evaluation of patient-centered outcomes among populations of people with AATD. A limited number of PROMs have been used in research on AATD or in clinical trials of treatment, including COPD-specific measures that assess symptoms and quality of life and measures of mood, sleep, and general physical and psychosocial functioning. The current study documented the available evidence and compiled a list of potential concepts of interest, but further qualitative and quantitative studies will be needed to understand the outcomes that matter to people with AATD and to evaluate the alignment between these outcomes and available measures."

To describe a rare case of PCC in a pulmonary transplant patient and characterize the tumour's genetic background. A 47 year-old man underwent a lung transplant for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease associated with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. He required home oxygen therapy for 3 years prior to transplant. Nineteen years after transplant, a CT-scan revealed a 5.8 cm x 3.9 cm heterogeneous right adrenal mass (HU of 7). Initial assessments indicated elevated 24-hour urinary catecholamines. Consequently, the patient underwent laparoscopic right adrenalectomy, confirming the PCC diagnosis. 1) Germline PPGL multigene panel: After consent, the patient underwent a panel of 14 susceptibility genes for PPGLs that revealed no pathogenic variants. 2) Somatic genetic analysis for <i>EPAS1</i> gene found no variants. However, tumoral RNA sequencing unveiled activation of the HIF pathway. We describe a rare case of PCC in a pulmonary transplant recipient, with genetic analyses showing no germline pathogenic variants and no somatic variants in the <i>EPAS1</i> gene. RNA sequencing highlighted HIF pathway activation and angiogenic implications. Further research is necessary to elucidate the genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying PCCs in this specific case and determine its link with hypoxemia in the context of pulmonary disease."

    "abstract": "Alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a genetic disorder that alters the functionality and/or serum levels of alpha 1 antitrypsin (AAT). Dysfunctional forms of AAT, or low levels of serum AAT, predispose affected individuals to pulmonary complications. When AATD-associated lung disease develops, the most common pulmonary pathology is emphysema. The development of emphysema and decline in lung function varies by AATD genotype and is accelerated by risk factors, such as smoking. To improve the understanding and treatment of AATD, emerging knowledge and unresolved questions need to be discussed. Here we focus on developments in the areas of disease pathogenesis, biomarkers, and clinical endpoints for trials in AATD, as well as barriers to treatment. The clinical impact of AATD on lung function is highly variable and highlights the complexity of AATD pathogenesis, in which multiple underlying processes are involved. Reduced levels of functional AAT disrupt the protease-antiprotease homeostasis, leading to a loss of neutrophil elastase inhibition and the breakdown of elastin within the lung interstitium. Inflammatory processes also play a critical role in the development of AATD-associated lung disease, which is not yet fully understood. Biomarkers associated with the disease and its complications may have an important role in helping to address AATD underdiagnosis and evaluating response to treatment. To improve access to treatment, the problem of underdiagnosis needs to be addressed and the provision of therapeutic options needs to become uniform. Patients should also be empowered to play a key role in the self-management of the disease. Advancing our understanding of the disease will ultimately improve the life expectancy and quality of life for patients affected by AATD."

This recommendation was for all patients assigned a diagnosis of COPD based on relevant International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision codes. The rate of testing for and detecting individuals with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency was assessed in 12 one-month intervals before and after implementing the dashboard. <b>Results:</b> After the prompt, whereas testing was still performed in only a small percentage of guideline-concordant instances, the rate of testing for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency increased 3.8-fold (ie, from 1.2% to 4.6%, <i>P</i> < .05). This did not result in detection of new patients with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. The rate of testing increased both for alpha-1 antitrypsin serum levels and genotypes in each month after the intervention, though the rate of genotype testing was 2-5-fold lower than the rate of testing for serum level. <b>Conclusions:</b> The results of this preliminary study of a detection strategy for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency show that placing a reminder to test for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency when indicated in an electronic medical record health maintenance dashboard significantly increased the frequency of testing. Still, that only 4.6% of those in whom testing for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency was indicated were tested in the post-intervention period shows that, as for all other alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency-targeted detection interventions to date, the impact of the intervention was marginal and that other strategies remain needed to mitigate underrecognition.

However, the minimum clinically important difference (MCID) in lung density change is not known; this study aimed to derive and validate MCIDs for density values in AATD. The distribution method and anchoring density against forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) were used to derive mean and 95% confidence intervals for the MCID. Data from systematic reviews of CT density measurement and therapy for AATD obtained both absolute and annual changes in lung density. Using the range of potential MCID generated by these methods, a value was chosen for validation against mortality, lung function, and health status in the Birmingham, United Kingdom AATD cohort, using regression to adjust for confounders. Anchor and distribution methods generated a probable MCID of -1.87 g/L/year (range -1.53 to -2.20). The greatest differences between groups were found at the -2.2g/L/year with a greater FEV<sub>1</sub> decline in individuals with greater lung loss. Absolute lung density change had a probable MCID of -2.04g/L (range -1.83 to -2.30), and there was a difference in lung function (<i>p</i><0.001) and mortality; where individuals whose absolute lung loss of more than -2.04g/L had a greater risk of death (<i>p</i><0.05). From initial evidence, we have shown absolute lung density change as a potential outcome for emphysema modifying therapies in AATD rather than annual density change, with an MCID of -2.04g/L."

Using small RNA sequencing and qPCR, we examined plasma EV miRNAs in healthy controls (n = 20) and AATD patients (n = 17). We compared the EV miRNAs of AATD individuals with and without liver disease, developing an approach for detecting liver disease. A set of miRNAs identified in the AATD testing cohort was validated in a separate cohort of AATD patients (n = 45). We identified differential expression of 178 EV miRNAs in the plasma of the AATD testing cohort compared to controls. We categorized AATD individuals into those with and without liver disease, identifying 39 differentially expressed miRNAs. Six miRNAs were selected to test their ability to discriminate liver disease in AATD. These were validated for their specificity and sensitivity in an independent cohort of 45 AATD individuals. Our logistic model established composite scores with three- and four-miRNA combinations, achieving areas under the curve of 0.737 and 0.751, respectively, for predicting AATD liver disease. We introduce plasma EV-derived miRNAs as potential biomarkers for evaluating AATD liver disease. Plasma EV-associated miRNAs may represent a molecular signature of AATD liver disease and could serve as valuable tools for its detection and monitoring."

    "title": "Vascular Pathology in Alpha 1 Antitrypsin Deficient Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease and Emphysema Patients: Case Reports.",
    "abstract": "Alpha 1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (AATD) is a genetic condition that results from mutations in the <i>SERPINA1</i> gene, which can lead to deficient or dysfunctional Alpha 1 Antitrypsin (AAT) protein production. AATD is linked to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and emphysema. In addition to pulmonary manifestations, AATD has also been associated with vascular pathology due to excessive protease activity, tissue degradation, and vessel stiffening. Early AATD diagnosis is crucial to prevent progressive lung damage and associated pathologies. Here, we present case reports of two patients with AATD from the Temple University Hospital Outpatient Clinic, who exhibited aneurysms of the aorta and splenic artery. AATD should be considered a genetic risk factor for aneurysms and vascular diseases, necessitating cardiovascular monitoring in affected individuals. This report emphasizes both the need for heightened awareness of AATD as a potential etiology of unexplained vascular aneurysms, as well as the need for screening for vascular pathology in patients with AATD-associated COPD and emphysema to facilitate early intervention and improve patient outcomes."

    "abstract": "Alpha-1-antitrypsin (A1AT) deficiency is a common hereditary disorder associated with increased risk of developing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Many individuals with severe A1AT deficiency go undiagnosed, or are diagnosed late, and fail to benefit from disease-specific counseling and modifying care. Since the 2012 Canadian Thoracic Society (CTS) A1AT deficiency clinical practice guideline, new approaches to optimal diagnosis using modern genetic testing and studies of A1AT augmentation therapy have been published. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis, which along with expert clinical input, informed recommendations. We conditionally recommend testing for A1AT deficiency in all individuals with COPD at the time of diagnosis, individuals with adult-onset asthma with persistent airway obstruction, and individuals with unexplained bronchiectasis. We suggest genetic testing with DNA sequencing of SERPINA1 gene as the initial test for individuals with high clinical suspicion for A1AT deficiency, and initial measurement of serum A1AT levels in individuals with moderate clinical suspicion of A1AT deficiency, followed by genetic testing with DNA sequencing of SERPINA1 gene if A1AT level is <23 μmol/L (<1.2 g/L). Following identification of an abnormal gene for A1AT in individuals, whether heterozygote or homozygote, we suggest first-degree relatives be provided genetic counseling and offered testing for A1AT deficiency. The panel conditionally recommends A1AT augmentation therapy to patients who do not smoke or who formerly smoked with COPD (forced expiratory volume in 1 s [FEV<sub>1</sub>] < 80% predicted; associated with emphysema), with documented deficiency genotypes and severely reduced A1AT level (< 11 μmol/L or < 0.57 g/L) in addition to receiving optimal pharmacological and nonpharmacological therapies for COPD."

COPD occurrence in non-smokers with AAT deficiency (AATD) suggests inflammatory processes may contribute to COPD risk independently of smoking. We hypothesized that inflammatory protein biomarkers in non-AATD COPD are associated with moderate-to-severe COPD in AATD individuals, after accounting for clinical factors. Participants from the COPDGene (Pi*MM) and AAT Genetic Modifier Study (Pi*ZZ) were included. Proteins associated with FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC were identified, adjusting for confounders and familial relatedness. Lung-specific protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were constructed. Proteins associated with AAT augmentation therapy were identified, and drug repurposing analyses performed. A protein risk score (protRS) was developed in COPDGene and validated in AAT GMS using AUC analysis. Machine learning ranked proteomic predictors, adjusting for age, sex, and smoking history. Among 4,446 Pi*MM and 352 Pi*ZZ individuals, sixteen blood proteins were associated with airflow obstruction, fourteen of which were highly expressed in lung. PPI networks implicated regulation of immune system function, cytokine and interleukin signaling, and matrix metalloproteinases. Eleven proteins, including IL4R, were linked to augmentation therapy. Drug repurposing identified antibiotics, thyroid medications, hormone therapies, and antihistamines as potential AATD treatments. Adding protRS improved COPD prediction in AAT GMS (AUC 0.86 vs. 0.80, p = 0.0001). AGER was the top-ranked protein predictor of COPD. Sixteen proteins are associated with COPD and inflammatory processes that predict airflow obstruction in AATD after accounting for age and smoking. Immune activation and inflammation are modulators of COPD risk in AATD."

    "abstract": "Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) is a key serine protease inhibitor for regulating proteases such as neutrophil elastase. AAT restrains the pulmonary matrix from enzymatic degradation, and a deficiency in AAT leads to inflammatory tissue damage in the lungs, resulting in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Due to the crucial biological function of AAT, the emerging research interest in this protein has shifted to its role in cancer-associated inflammation and the dynamics of the tumor microenvironment. However, the lack of comprehensive reviews in this field hinders our understanding of AAT as an essential immune modulator with great potential in cancer immunotherapy. Therefore, in this review, we have elucidated the pivotal roles of AAT in inflammation and the tumor microenvironment, including the structure and molecular properties of AAT, its molecular functions in the regulation of the inflammatory response and tumor microenvironment, and its clinical implications in cancer including its diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic intervention. This review seeks to bridge the gap in the understanding of AAT between inflammatory diseases and cancer, and to foster deeper investigations into its translational potential in cancer immunotherapy in the future."

To investigate non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis etiology and clinical characteristics in adults evaluated in the southwest of Colombia. We conducted a cross-sectional, non-interventional study. Subjects diagnosed with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis were referred to by their healthcare providers and then enrolled between October 2018 and April 2021. Medical records and radiological studies were evaluated. Participants underwent laboratory tests, including complete blood count, serum immunoglobulin levels, and, in some cases, additional tests. We included 161 subjects. The average age was 50 years old, and 59% were females. Bronchiectasis etiology was identified in 84.6% of the cases. Postinfectious (34.6%) and immune disorders (25.3%), represented by autoimmunity (13.6%) and immunodeficiency (11.7%), were the leading causes. Gender differences were noted in autoimmune (females: 18.8% versus males: 6.1%, p = 0.021) and immunodeficiency-related bronchiectasis (males: 21.2% versus females 5.2%, p = 0.002). Immunodeficiencies-associated bronchiectases were more frequent in subjects under 50 years of age, while chronic obstructive pulmonary disease-associated bronchiectases were common in subjects over 50 years of age. The etiologies of non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis in Colombia are diverse, exhibiting notable differences from other global regions.

PROMs for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) are commonly used instead, but AATD differs from COPD in several ways. We reviewed whether the PROMs used in the AATD literature adequately assess quality-of-life in these patients. 11 studies used PROMs as their primary outcomes; 21 included them as secondary outcomes. The St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) was the most commonly used PROM, used by 7 of the 11 primary outcome studies. Others included the COPD Assessment Tool, SF-36, LCOPD, EQ-5D, and the Chronic Respiratory Diseases Questionnaire. Several studies assessed SGRQ as being associated with respiratory disease severity as measured by FEV1% predicted, exacerbation rate, oxygen use and exercise tolerance. However, no studies used PROMs which included assessment of liver-related symptoms, other extra-pulmonary manifestations of AATD, or concerns related to genetics or finances. These factors are likely to have an impact on quality of life in AATD. A specific AATD-PROM is therefore required to holistically address the quality of life effects of an AATD diagnosis."

This was a double-blind, randomised, parallel group, placebo-controlled trial to examine the safety and tolerability of \"Kamada-AAT for Inhalation\" (inhaled AAT) in subjects with AAT deficiency, and to explore its effect on AAT and biomarkers in the lung epithelial lining fluid (ELF). 36 patients with severe AAT deficiency were randomised 2:1 to receive 80 mg or 160 mg inhaled AAT or placebo once daily for 12 weeks. The primary outcomes were AAT and antineutrophil elastase capacity (ANEC) in bronchoalveolar lavage and plasma after treatment. Secondary outcomes included safety, levels of normal M-type AAT in the plasma and concentrations of AAT, neutrophil elastase (NE), AAT-NE complexes and neutrophil count in the ELF. 12 weeks of active treatment significantly increased AAT, ANEC and AAT-NE complexes in the ELF. Mean antigenic AAT levels in the ELF were restored to 5.2±2.3 μM in the 80 mg arm and to 17.7±2 μM in the 160 mg arm. Both doses significantly restored AAT antiprotease activity within the lung and reduced NE levels. M-specific AAT levels in plasma increased in a dose-dependent manner. A clinically meaningful reduction in ELF neutrophil % was observed in the 80 mg arm. AAT for inhalation was well tolerated. Inhaled AAT restores protease-antiprotease homoeostasis and may represent a safe and effective therapy."

Using high-throughput screening, we discovered a bioactive natural product, phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC), highly enriched in cruciferous vegetables, including watercress and broccoli, which improves the level of monomer secretion and neutrophil elastase (NE) inhibitory activity of AAT-Z through the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) redox sensor protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) A4 (PDIA4). The intracellular polymer burden of AAT-Z can be managed by combination treatment of PEITC and an autophagy activator. Using Gaussian process (GP)-based spatial covariance (SCV) (GP-SCV) machine learning to map on a residue-by-residue basis at atomic resolution all variants in the worldwide AATD clinical population, we reveal a global rescue of monomer secretion and NE inhibitory activity for most variants triggering disease. We present a proof of concept that GP-SCV mapping of restoration of AAT variant function serves as a standard model to discover natural products such as the anti-oxidant PEITC that could potentially impact the redox/inflammatory environment of the ER to provide a nutraceutical approach to help minimize disease in AATD patients."

    "abstract": "Corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG; SERPINA6) binds >85% of circulating glucocorticoids but its influence on their metabolic actions is unproven. Targeted proteolytic cleavage of CBG by neutrophil elastase (NE; ELANE) significantly reduces CBG binding affinity, potentially increasing 'free' glucocorticoid levels at sites of inflammation. NE is inhibited by alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT; SERPINA1). Using complementary approaches in mice and humans to manipulate NE or AAT, we show high-fat diet (HFD) increases the NE:AAT ratio specifically in murine visceral adipose tissue, an effect only observed in males. Notably, HFD-fed male mice lacking NE have reduced glucocorticoid levels and action specifically in visceral adipose tissue, with improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, independent of systemic changes in free glucocorticoids. The protective effect of NE deficiency is lost when the adrenals are removed. Moreover, human asymptomatic heterozygous carriers of deleterious mutations in SERPINA1 resulting in lower AAT levels have increased adipose tissue glucocorticoid levels and action. However, in contrast to mice, humans present with systemic increases in free circulating glucocorticoid levels, an effect independent of HPA axis activation. These findings show that NE and AAT regulate local tissue glucocorticoid bioavailability in vivo, providing crucial evidence of a mechanism linking inflammation and metabolism."

    "abstract": "Neutrophil elastase (NE) is released by activated neutrophils during an inflammatory response and exerts proteolytic activity on elastin and other extracellular matrix components. This protease is rapidly inhibited by the plasma serine protease inhibitor alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT), and the importance of this protective activity on lung tissue is highlighted by the development of early onset emphysema in individuals with AAT deficiency. As a serpin, AAT presents a surface-exposed reactive centre loop (RCL) whose sequence mirrors the target protease specificity. Following binding of NE in a 'Michaelis' encounter complex, cleavage of the RCL results in an irreversible complex between the two molecules. Here, the structure of the AAT-NE encounter complex was studied by molecular dynamics, mutagenesis and enzyme kinetics. Exploration of the geometry of interaction between the two molecules revealed the possibility that the interaction interface extends beyond the RCL; a persistent feature of the simulations was the interaction between a region located upstream of β-strand 4C of AAT, comprising three acidic residues (Asp202, Glu199 and Glu204), and Arg147 of NE. Mutation of the acidic residues to either alanine or serine, or a D202R substitution, resulted in a reduced rate of association between recombinant AAT and NE. Addition of salt to the buffer had little effect for these mutants but substantially reduced the rate of interaction of the wild-type protein. These data are consistent with a role for this acidic region on AAT as an exosite that contributes to an optimal interaction with its physiological protease target."

The Swedish National Patient Registry was utilized to identify patients with a first diagnosis of AATD between 2002 and 2020. Each patient was matched with up to 10 comparators from the general population. AATD incidence and prevalence were estimated. Causes of death and rates of mortality, transplantation, lung disease, liver cirrhosis, and previous neonatal cholestasis were estimated. The incidence rate of AATD was 1.83 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.58-2.11) per 100,000 person-years and the total prevalence was 21.04 (95%CI = 20.17-21.94) per 100,000 persons at the end of 2020. Mortality was 3.55 times higher (95%CI = 3.15-3.99) for patients with AATD.

Neonatal cholestasis codes were found in 3.0% of AATD patients and 0.5% of comparators (odds ratio 6.28, 95%CI = 3.81-10.36). In this population-based cohort study on AATD in Sweden, an increasing incidence was observed, and significantly higher rates of death from liver, lung, and cardiovascular causes compared to the general population were found.

Quality of life questionnaires are instruments designed to quantify the deterioration of a patient's health. <b>Background/Objectives</b>: This study aimed to assess whether certain quality of life tests that are routinely used in clinical practice can be useful for patients with AATD. <b>Methods</b>: A sample of AATD patients, with various genotypes, but with the common characteristic that they must have both altered alleles (Pi* ≠ M), participated in the study. Different quality of life tests were used, including the COPD Assessment Test (CAT), COPD and Asthma Sleep Impact Scale, the short form of the Short Form Health Survey, and EuroQol 5 dimensions, and were related to differing clinical and functional characteristics. <b>Results</b>: The sample was composed of 54 patients, and slightly more than half of the participants were women (57.4%), with a mean age of 51.5 ± 13.7. The main genotypes were Pi*SZ (43.4%) and Pi*ZZ (34%). In patients under 65 years of age (<i>n</i> = 47), those who were actively working could walk a greater distance in the walking test, namely, 573 m (511-629), compared to those who were not actively working, namely, 415.5 m (392-469; <i>p</i> < 0.001). Active non-workers had a worse CAT (13.6 ± 7.8 vs. 4.6 ± 4.3; <i>p</i> < 0.001). In total, 80% of non-working patients had exacerbations, but only 46. 9% of those who were active, although the association did not reach statistical significance (<i>p</i> = 0.068). Having a lower score in the physical component of SF-12 was related to suffering from lung disease (46.0 ± 11.4 vs. 38.4 ± 11.1 (<i>p</i> = 0.026)). <b>Conclusions</b>: Quality of life tests were able to detect differences and relate them to functional factors such as the distance covered in the walking test, being sensitive and specific in this regard."

We examined genotypes and clinical characteristics of COPD patients (index cases; n = 14) treated at Recep Tayyip Erdoğan University Chest Diseases Department and their relatives (n = 17). When index cases were compared with screened relatives positive for AATD (n = 14), index cases were older and more predominantly male than screened relatives. Both groups had extensive smoking histories. All of the index cases and one of the screened relatives had been diagnosed with COPD.

Cox regression models were used to assess risk of mild and severe COVID-19 by presence of COPD. Of 863 subjects with severe AATD, 231 reported COVID-19 infection (208 mild and 23 severe COVID-19). Subjects with severe COVID-19 were older, had lower FEV<sub>1</sub> values, were more likely ever-smokers and had more comorbidities compared to those with mild COVID-19. Subjects with COPD had over a 5-fold increased risk of severe COVID-19 compared to those without COPD (HR 5.43 (95% CI 1.61-18.27, p=0.006).

We systematically analysed the composition of AAT aggregates and studied the impact of bile acids. AAT inclusions were isolated from livers of PiZ overexpressing mice and PIZZ humans via fluorescence-activated and immunomagnetic sorting (FACS/MACS), while insoluble proteins were obtained via Triton-X extraction. Inclusion composition was evaluated through mass-spectrometry (MS), immunoblotting and immunostaining. Hepatocytes with versus without AAT aggregates were obtained via microdissection. Serum bile acids were assessed in 57 PIZZ subjects and 19 controls. Mice were administered 2% cholic acid (CA)-supplemented chow for 7 days. MS identified the key endoplasmic reticulum chaperone 78 kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78) in FACS/MACS pulldowns. GRP78 was also enriched in insoluble fractions from PiZ mice versus wild types and detected in insoluble fractions/MACS isolates from PIZZ liver explants. In cultured cells/primary hepatocytes, PiZ overexpression was associated with increased GRP78 mRNA/protein levels. In human livers, hepatocytes with AAT aggregates had higher GRP78 levels than hepatocytes without. PIZZ subjects displayed higher serum bile acid levels than controls and the highest levels were seen in individuals with liver injury/fibrosis. In PiZ mice, CA-mediated bile acid challenge resulted in increased liver injury and translocation of GRP78 into the aggregates. Our results demonstrate that GRP78 is sequestered within AAT inclusions. Bile acid accumulation, as seen in PIZZ subjects with liver disease, may promote GRP78 segregation and thereby augment liver damage. NCT02929940."

    "abstract": "Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a relatively rare genetic disorder, inherited in an autosomal codominant manner, that results in reduced serum AAT concentrations, with a consequent reduction in antielastase activity in the lungs, as well as an increased risk of diseases such as pulmonary emphysema, liver cirrhosis, and necrotizing panniculitis. It results from different mutations in the SERPINA1 gene, leading to changes in the AAT glycoprotein, which can alter its concentration, conformation, and function. Unfortunately, underdiagnosis is quite common; it is possible that only 10% of cases are diagnosed. The most common deficiency is in the Z variant, and it is estimated that more than 3 million people worldwide have combinations of alleles associated with severe AATD. Serum AAT concentrations should be determined, and allelic variants should be identified by phenotyping or genotyping. Monitoring lung function, especially through spirometry, is essential, because it provides information on the progression of the disease. Although pulmonary densitometry appears to be the most sensitive measure of emphysema progression, it should not be used in routine clinical practice to monitor patients. In general, the treatment is similar to that indicated for patients with COPD not caused by AATD. Exogenous administration of purified human serum-derived AAT is the only specific treatment approved for AATD in nonsmoking patients with severe deficiency (serum AAT concentration of < 57 mg/dL or < 11 µM), with evidence of functional loss above the physiological level."

Infants born from 2010 to 2021, who underwent HS <6 months postpartum for BA, were included and data sourced from electronic medical records. The change in threshold in 2018 from ≥20 (and/or if conjugated bilirubin exceeds 20% of total bilirubin) to ≥17 μM (regardless of total bilirubin) was evaluated. In the cohort of 635 infants, 48 had BA, 247 had AATD, and the remaining 343 were categorised as 'other'. After the threshold adjustment, HS timing was unaffected (p = 0.27), but the annual HS rate rose from 39 to 87, yet evaluations following the new guideline only accounted for 12%. All liver parameters were elevated in the BA group compared with the additional groups (p < 0.001). Amongst the 104 patients with non-excretory HS, gamma-glutamyl transferase (p < 0.001) and alanine aminotransferase (p = 0.002) remained elevated for BA. The lowest conjugated bilirubin measured in BA children was 36 μM. After threshold change, HS use increased without earlier BA diagnostics, but most were not due to the new guideline. Alanine aminotransferase and gamma-glutamyl transferase should be considered in BA diagnostics."

    "title": "Novel Lobe-based Transformer model (LobTe) to predict emphysema progression in Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency.",
    "abstract": "Emphysema, marked by irreversible lung tissue destruction, poses challenges in progression prediction due to its heterogeneity. Early detection is particularly critical for patients with Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (AATD), a genetic disorder reducing ATT protein levels. Heterozygous carriers (PiMS and PiMZ) have variable AAT levels thus complicating their prognosis. This study introduces a novel prognostic model, the Lobe-based Transformer encoder (LobTe), designed to predict the annual change in lung density (ΔALD [g/L-yr]) using CT scans. Utilizing a global self-attention mechanism, LobTe specifically analyzes lobar tissue destruction to forecast disease progression. In parallel, we developed and compared a second model utilizing an LSTM architecture that implements a local subject-specific attention mechanism. Our methodology was validated on a cohort of 2,019 participants from the COPDGene study. The LobTe model demonstrated a small root mean squared error (RMSE=1.73 g/L-yr) and a notable correlation coefficient (ρ=0.61), explaining over 35% of the variability in ΔALD (R<sup>2</sup>= 0.36). Notably, it achieved a higher correlation coefficient of 0.68 for PiMZ heterozygous carriers, indicating its effectiveness in detecting early emphysema progression among smokers with mild to moderate AAT deficiency. The presented models could serve as a tool for monitoring disease progression and informing treatment strategies in carriers and subjects with AATD. Our code is available at github.com/acil-bwh/LobTe."

    "abstract": "Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency is the most common genetic cause of emphysema. Chymotrypsin-like elastase 1 (CELA1) is a serine protease neutralized by AAT and is important in emphysema progression. <i>Cela1</i>-deficiency is protective in murine models of AAT-deficient emphysema. KF4 anti-CELA1 antibody prevented emphysema in porcine pancreatic elastase (PPE) and cigarette smoke models in wild-type mice. We evaluated potential toxicities of KF4 and its ability to prevent emphysema in AAT deficiency. We found Cela1 protein expression in mouse lungs, pancreas, small intestine, spleen, and bone marrow. In toxicity studies, mice treated with KF4 25mg/kg weekly for 4 weeks showed an elevation in blood urea nitrogen and slower weight gain compared to lower doses or equivalent dose immunoglobin G (IgG). By histologic grading of tissue injury of the lung, kidney, liver, and heart, there was some evidence of liver injury with KF4 25mg/kg, but in all tissues, injury was less than in control mice subjected to cecal ligation and puncture. In efficacy studies, KF4 doses as low as 0.5mg/kg reduced the lung elastase activity of <i>AAT<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice treated with 0.2 units of PPE. In this injury model, <i>AAT<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice treated with KF4 1mg/kg weekly, human purified AAT 60mg/kg weekly, and combined KF4 and AAT treatment had less emphysema than mice treated with IgG 1mg/kg weekly. However, the efficacy of KF4, AAT, or KF4 and AAT was similar. While KF4 might be an alternative to AAT replacement, combined KF4 and AAT replacement does not confer additional benefit."

    "title": "Improving the Likelihood of Identifying Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency Among Patients With COPD: A Novel Predictive Model Using Real-World Data.",
    "abstract": "Despite guideline recommendations, most patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) do not undergo alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) testing and approximately 90% of people with AATD in the United States remain undiagnosed. This study sought to develop a predictive model using real-world data to improve detection of AATD-positive patients in the general COPD population. A predictive model using extreme gradient boosting was developed using the EVERSANA database, including longitudinal, patient-level medical claims, prescription claims, AATD-specific testing data, and electronic health records (EHR). The model was trained and then validated to predict AATD-positive status. Patients were coded as AATD positive based on the presence of any of the following criteria: (1) ≥2 AATD diagnosis codes in claims; (2) an AATD diagnosis code in the EHR; (3) a positive laboratory test for AATD; or (4) use of AATD-related medication. Over 500 variables were used to train the predictive model and >20 models were run to optimize the predictive power. A total of 13,585 AATD-positive patients and 7796 AATD-negative patients were included in the model. The inclusion of non-AATD laboratory test results was critical for defining cohorts and optimizing model prediction (e.g., respiratory comorbidities, and calcium, glucose, hemoglobin, and bilirubin levels). The final model yielded high predictive power, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.9. Predictive modeling using real-world data is a sound approach for assessing AATD risk and useful for identifying COPD patients who should be confirmed by genetic testing. External validation is warranted to further assess the generalizability of these results."

    "abstract": "Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (AATD) is a co-dominant condition associated with an increased risk of lung and liver disease. Since it is commonly thought that 95% of severe cases of AATD have PI*ZZ genotype, most studies about AATD have been focused on the Z variant. Nevertheless, over 500 single nucleotide variations in the <i>SERPINA1</i> gene have been identified. We investigated the clinical presentation of subjects with severe AAT deficiency due to rare genotypes of the <i>SERPINA1</i> gene. We enrolled patients from the Italian Registry for AATD (RIDA1) with the following inclusion criteria: diagnosis of severe AATD; age >18 years; full clinical data available at diagnosis; three years of follow-up respiratory function data. A total of 281 patients were enrolled from the RIDA1 Registry and subdivided into 3 cohorts: PI*ZZ genotype (n = 160), PI*SZ genotype (n = 54), and rare genotypes PI*R (n = 67). We did not observe any statistical differences among the cohorts regarding sex, smoking habits, occupational exposure and age at diagnosis. Patients with severe AATD due to rare genotypes have clinical characteristics and respiratory profiles similar to PI*ZZ subjects, and differed from the PI*SZ patient group. Early and accurate diagnosis of PI*R subjects is therefore important for their appropriate clinical management."

    "abstract": "The diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) encompasses heterogeneous pathophysiological mechanisms which can shape an individual patient's experience. This paper reviews available therapeutic options for the clinician intending to individualize care toward patient goals. The contemporary targeted interventions for COPD include the novel phosphodiesterase inhibitor ensifentrine, the interleukin-4 receptor (IL4R alpha subunit) antibody dupilumab, augmentation therapy for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. Other interventions promoting physical and mental well being include re-envisioned pulmonary rehabilitation, self-management, targeting of comorbidities such as sarcopenia, and virtual health coaching interventions to expand patient access. Opioids did not relieve dyspnea and did not change total step count. Advances in precision therapy are complemented by the discovery of novel pathophysiology pathways and behavioral and rehabilitation interventions as a holistic view of COPD management emerges. The management of COPD continues to evolve with new tools including precision medicine and individualized care. Comorbidities remain important determinants of health, yet their prevalence and impact are underestimated."

These require initial proof-of-concept demonstration that treatment administration increases alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) levels and/or anti-neutrophil elastase inhibitory capacity (ANEC) in the lung. Early-phase studies often encounter high interindividual variability of BAL results, primarily stemming from the inherent dilution characteristics of returned BAL fluid. A BAL protocol that minimises this variability is needed for reliable comparison of biochemical endpoints in the lung. The study population included 21 severe AATD (ZZ), 22 moderate AATD (MZ) and 23 non-AATD (MM) individuals, further categorised as healthy, unobstructed current smokers or patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). An additional six ZZ individuals were receiving intravenous alpha-1 augmentation therapy. We compared common BAL correction methods-albumin, total protein and epithelial lining fluid (ELF) volume measured by urea-when reporting early-phase biochemical endpoints, AAT and ANEC. BAL performed with a paediatric bronchoscope (PB) improved alveolar sampling compared with a traditional adult bronchoscope. Both uncorrected and ELF-corrected BAL demonstrated high interindividual variability regardless of lung health status. BAL total protein correction minimised interindividual variability, producing significant differences in AAT and ANEC between all genotypes, the strongest relationship with plasma AAT levels (r<sup>2</sup>=0.83), greatest inter-lobar concordance in AAT levels (r<sup>2</sup>=0.76) and strong correlation between BAL AAT and ANEC (r<sup>2</sup>=0.88). By capitalising on the marked consistency in AAT levels between AAT genotypes, and the close relationship between plasma and lung AAT levels, we demonstrate reliable alveolar sampling that aligns closely with plasma."

    "abstract": "Alpha-1 antitrypsin (A1AT) is the major circulating serine protease inhibitor. Hypersialylated glycoforms (HSG) are produced to boost A1AT anti-inflammatory and anti-protease properties. Their occurrence and prognostic impact outside severe COVID-19 or community-acquired pneumonia are unknown. Our aim was to clarify the occurrence of A1AT functional deficiency and HSG in patients admitted into intensive care unit (ICU) for any cause. A1AT and elastase inhibitory capacity (EIC) were measured in serum. Functional A1AT deficiency was defined by a measured EIC/calculated EIC Ratio ≤0.85. HSG were identified by isoelectrofocusing and quantified by gel densitometry. A total of 248 serum samples was analyzed, 173 from COVID-19 and 75 from non COVID-19 patients. A functional A1AT deficiency occurred 3-fold more frequently in non-COVID-19 than in COVID-19 patients: 18.7 % vs 6.9 % and was not associated with more frequent S/Z deficient alleles. Functional deficiency was also more frequent in deceased than alive patients in COVID-19 group. M0 and M1 HSG of A1AT occurred in around half of patients but the relative proportion of M1 significantly increased in deceased vs alive patients only in the non-COVID-19 group explaining the absence of worsening of the functional deficiency. In conclusion, our study shows that a functional A1AT deficiency is more frequently observed in patients admitted to the ICU for a cause unrelated to COVID-19, as well as in those with an unfavorable evolution. Among the latter, only those admitted for non-COVID-19 tried to compensate the functional deficiency by increasing the proportion of M1 HSG of A1AT."

    "abstract": "Patients with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) often experience substantial delays from the onset of symptoms to a diagnosis. We explored the impact of delayed diagnosis of AATD on healthcare costs and utilization by assessing costs/utilization before and after diagnosis. Retrospective claims data was used to conduct a longitudinal analysis of a cohort of patients with follow-up over four years in a commercial claims database was conducted. Patients with at least four years of claims experience between the years 2011 - 2017 were included in this study. Outcome measures were calculated for each year (Year 1 pre-index diagnosis, and Years 1, 2, and 3 post-index follow-up). Measures included healthcare costs (pharmacy and medical costs), medical costs, inpatient events, and emergency room visits. Unadjusted measures in the follow-up Year 1, Year 2, and Year 3 were compared to Year 1 pre-index. A separate multivariate analysis adjusting for age, sex, and comorbidities was conducted. Among 1258 patients, mean adjusted healthcare costs were significantly higher in Year 1 post-index compared to Year 1 pre-index ($51,785 vs $41,441, p = < 0.05). In Year 2 ($36,937 vs $41,441, p = < 0.05) and 3 ($28,558 vs $41,441, p = < 0.05) post-index, mean adjusted healthcare costs decreased compared to Year 1 pre-index. Adjusted medical costs were similar in Year 1 ($25,034) post-index compared to Year 1 ($22,952) pre-index but were significantly lower in Year 2 ($15,242 vs $25,034, p = < 0.05) and Year 3 ($8,779 vs $25,034, p = < 0.05) post-index. The frequency of inpatient and emergency room events was significantly lower in all three observation periods following diagnosis in the unadjusted analysis. The adjusted analysis showed similar findings, except for emergency room visits, which were similar across all observation periods. Patients with AATD had substantial healthcare costs/utilization in the year before diagnosis. Costs were significantly higher in the first year following diagnosis. However, subsequent years showed cost reductions to levels below pre-diagnosis. These data support the need for strategies to reduce the time from symptom onset to diagnosis."

Males accounted for 58.21% of the hospitalizations and had a higher Charlson Comorbidity Index than women (1.86 vs. 1.33; <i>p</i> < 0.001), were hospitalized more frequently (21.18% of men were hospitalized more than once vs. 17.76% of women, <i>p</i> < 0.001), and had a higher probability of severe disease (OR 1.39; 95%CI 1.10-1.75). Crude in-hospital mortality (IHM) was 6.85% in men and 4.8% in women (<i>p</i> = 0.007). The variables associated with IHM in both sexes were older age, more hospital admissions, and liver disease or lung cancer. Invasive and non-invasive mechanical ventilation and admission to the ICU were also associated with IHM in men and women. Multivariable adjustment revealed no association between sex and IHM. <b>Conclusions</b>: The number of hospitalizations for AATD increased in Spain from 2016 to 2022. Men represented almost 60% of hospitalizations, were admitted more frequently and with more comorbidities, and had a higher probability of severe disease than women. There was no association between sex and IHM."

    "title": "Psychiatric Disorders in Patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease: Clinical Significance and Treatment Strategies.",
    "abstract": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a debilitating lung disease characterized by chronic airflow limitation and persistent respiratory symptoms. It is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, significantly impacting healthcare systems with considerable socioeconomic consequences. The main risk factors include exposure to tobacco smoke, environmental pollutants, occupational dust, and genetic factors such as alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. COPD is often associated with extrapulmonary comorbidities, particularly psychiatric disorders like depression and anxiety, which worsen patients' quality of life and prognosis. The prevalence of these disorders in patients with COPD varies significantly but is always higher than in healthy controls. Psychiatric disorders can negatively influence COPD management and vice versa, creating a complex bidirectional interaction. Depression and anxiety are the most common psychiatric comorbidities in patients with COPD, influenced by factors such as social isolation, physical limitations, and fear of exacerbations. Diagnosis of these psychiatric disorders is complicated by the overlap of symptoms with those of COPD. However, some screening tools can facilitate early detection. The treatment of psychiatric disorders in patients with COPD in a rehabilitation setting requires a multidisciplinary approach involving pulmonologists, neurologists and psychologists. Pharmacological therapy with antidepressants shows mixed results in terms of efficacy and safety, with some studies reporting benefits on quality of life and others suggesting an increased risk of exacerbations and pneumonia. An integrated approach that includes the assessment and intervention of mental disorders is essential to improve the overall management of COPD and the quality of life of patients. This narrative review provides an overview of the main psychiatric comorbidities in COPD patients, aiming to fill gaps in the literature and suggest areas for future research."

The plasma level of BNP is used to measure the mechanical function of the heart and the risk of developing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) is a glycoprotein that acts as an inhibitor of serine proteases and plays a crucial role in protecting the lungs against potential harm. AAT deficiency also causes COPD. The data on the prevalence of BNP and AAT in African Americans (AA) are limited and inconsistent. No previous studies have investigated whether any association exists between BNP and AAT. We collected fasting blood samples from 114 AA subjects who provided informed consent. The plasma levels of the biomarkers were measured using ELISA. Our findings revealed a significant negative correlation between AAT and BNP (r=-0.266, p = 0.01) as well as between AAT and TNF-α (r=-0.242, p = 0.01). Sex hormones (estrogen and testosterone) have a significant relationship with the levels of AAT and BNP. Increasing the AAT and reducing the levels of inflammation can lower the levels of BNP, which in turn could help lower the risk of heart disease in the AA population."

The association of A1AD and BD is unknown. We describe a rare case of concomitant presentation of these pathologies in a patient submitted to LTx. In 2012, a 31-year-old female presented with oral and genital ulcers associated with cavernous sinus thrombosis, being diagnosed with BD. In 2018, debuted with progressive respiratory symptoms. A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed extensive pulmonary emphysema associated with decreased pulmonary function. A1AD was identified with a heterozygous \"MZ\" allelic combination. She was referred to our LTx center in 2021. After additional investigation, she was considered for LTx and underwent standard bilateral LTx in July 2022. In the postoperative period, special attention was given to the risk of vascular complications, and postoperative angiography-CT was performed actively searching for this possible outcome. No major events occurred, and after 1 year, she is fully functional with no signs of BD activity. To our knowledge, this is the first description of LTx for A1AD in a patient with BD, proving its feasibility in a highly selected patient at an experienced and specialized center. Nonetheless, solid organ transplantation in patients with BD remains a high-risk procedure and should be indicated with caution."

There are currently no effective treatments for pertussis, complicating care for nonvaccinated individuals, especially newborns. Disease manifestations are predominantly caused by pertussis toxin (PT), a pivotal virulence factor classified as an ADP-ribosylating AB-type protein toxin. In this work, an unbiased approach using peptide libraries, bioassay-guided fractionation and mass spectrometry revealed α<sub>1</sub>-antitrypsin (α<sub>1</sub>AT) as a potent PT inhibitor. Biochemistry-, cell culture-, and molecular modeling-based in vitro experimentation demonstrated that the α<sub>1</sub>AT mode of action is based on blocking PT-binding to the host target cell surface. In the infant mouse model of severe pertussis, α<sub>1</sub>AT expression was reduced upon infection. Further, systemic administration of α<sub>1</sub>AT significantly reduced B. pertussis-induced leukocytosis, which is a hallmark of infant infection and major risk factor for fatal pertussis. Taken together our data demonstrates that α<sub>1</sub>AT is a novel PT inhibitor and that further evaluation and development of α<sub>1</sub>AT as a therapeutic agent for pertussis is warranted. Importantly, purified α<sub>1</sub>AT is already in use clinically as an intravenous augmentation therapy for those with genetic α<sub>1</sub>AT deficiency and could be repurposed to clinical management of pertussis."

This results in progressive liver disease secondary to AAT polymerization and accumulation, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) due to deficient levels of AAT within the lungs. Our goal was to characterize the unique effects of COPD secondary to AATD on liver disease and gene expression. A subcohort of AATD individuals with COPD (n = 33) and AATD individuals without COPD (n = 14) were evaluated in this study from our previously reported cross-sectional cohort. We used immunohistochemistry to assess the AATD liver phenotype, and RNA sequencing to explore liver transcriptomics. We observed a distinct transcriptomic profile in liver tissues from AATD individuals with COPD compared to those without. A total of 339 genes were differentially expressed. Canonical pathways related to fibrosis, extracellular matrix remodeling, collagen deposition, hepatocellular damage, and inflammation were significantly upregulated in the livers of AATD individuals with COPD. Histopathological analysis also revealed higher levels of fibrosis and hepatocellular damage in these individuals. Our data supports a relationship between the development of COPD and liver disease in AATD and introduces genes and pathways that may play a role in AATD liver disease when COPD is present. We believe addressing lung impairment and airway inflammation may be an approach to managing AATD-related liver disease."

Thirty patients with AATD (genotype PiZZ) and COPD III-IV were randomly assigned to either high-intensity (HIT) or moderate-intensity training (MIT), each consisting of endurance, strength, and squat training for a duration of 3 weeks. 6-Min walk distance (6MWD) was used as the primary outcome. Twenty-five subjects augmented with alpha-1 antitrypsin (HIT: n = 12, FEV1 41.3 ± 17.4%pred., MIT: n = 13, FEV1 45.9 ± 15.5%pred.) completed the study. In HIT and MIT, 6MWD (+37 ± 43 m vs. +32 ± 28 m, p = 0.741), 1-min sit-to-stand test (5.6 ± 4.9 repetitions vs. 5.6 ± 4.5 repetitions, p = 0.766), exercise-induced BORG dyspnoea (-1.4 ± 1.7 pts vs. -1.5 ± 2.4 pts, p = 0.952), and all CRQ domains have improved after training without between-group differences. When considering only subgroups of (probably) anxious or depressive patients (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale [HADS] ≥8 pts), only HIT induced a significant reduction of anxiety (-4.8 pts, 95% CI [2.1-7.5]) or depression symptoms (-5.0 pts, 95% CI [2.8-7.3]). Although HIT and MIT were equally effective by improving exercise capacity, quality of life, and dyspnoea in homozygous AATD, HIT may show advantages over MIT, if anxiety or depression symptoms were present. The goal should be personalized training based on the patient's personal preference in order to achieve long-term adherence."

Cohort 1 recruited 737 Pi∗ZZ individuals from 25 different centers without known liver comorbidities who received a baseline clinical and laboratory assessment as well as liver stiffness measurement (LSM).

During 2634 patient-years of follow-up, 39 individuals died, with liver and lung being responsible for 46% and 36% of deaths, respectively. Forty-one Pi∗ZZ subjects who developed a hepatic endpoint presented with significantly higher baseline liver fibrosis surrogates, that is, LSM (24 vs 5 kPa, P < .001) and aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index (1.1 vs 0.3 units, P < .001). Liver-related endpoints within 5 years were most accurately predicted by LSM (area under the curve 0.95) followed by aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index (0.92). Baseline lung parameters displayed only a moderate predictive utility for lung-related endpoints within 5 years (forced expiratory volume in the first second area under the curve 0.76). Fibrosis progression in those with no/mild fibrosis at baseline was rare and primarily seen in those with preexisting risk factors. Noninvasive liver fibrosis surrogates accurately stratify liver-related risks in Pi∗ZZ individuals. Our findings have direct implications for routine care and future clinical trials of Pi∗ZZ patients."

The study included 2165 participants (mean age 56.9 ± 10.0 years, 47.0 % female). At enrollment, mean PCS score was 37.5 ± 9.6, and mean MCS score was 51.9 ± 10.5. Mean mMRC dyspnea score was 2.3 ± 1.3; 54.6 % had ≥2 exacerbations annually, and 46.5 % used oxygen regularly. Average follow-up was 6.6 ± 3.2 years. The HRQoL remained stable; MCS improved by 0.16 points/year (p < 0.0001), while the PCS score declined by 0.49 points/year (p < 0.0001). Subscales followed similar trends. At baseline, mental HRQoL scores were higher than physical HRQoL scores, indicating better mental health than physical health in this cohort with AATD-associated lung disease. Stable HRQoL with a slight improvement in mental scores over time and a small decrease in physical scores may be a unique feature of this cohort. Further studies are needed to correlate these findings with disease-specific instruments and patient physiology."

    "title": "Editing Approaches to Treat Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency.",
    "abstract": "Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency is a genetic disorder most commonly due to a single G to A point mutation (E342K), leading to debilitating lung and/or liver disorders and is associated with increased mortality. The E342K point mutation causes a conformational change of the AAT protein resulting in its retention in liver hepatocytes. This reduces AAT secretion into the serum resulting in higher protease activities due to the lack of inhibition from AAT, causing damage to healthy lung tissue. The current standard of care for lung manifestations involves weekly IV augmentation therapy and is considered suboptimal for these patients. Furthermore, there is currently no approved treatment for liver manifestations. The unmet medical need for patients with AAT deficiency remains high, and new treatment options are needed to treat the underlying disease etiology. Advances in genomic medicines may enable treatment by editing the DNA or RNA sequence to produce wild-type AAT instead of the mutated AAT caused by the E342K mutation. One approach can be achieved by directing endogenous adenosine deaminases that act on RNA to the E342K RNA site, where they catalyze adenosine to inosine conversion through a process known as RNA editing. The A-I RNA change will be read as a G during protein translation, resulting in an altered amino acid and restoration of wild-type AAT secretion and function. In this review, we will discuss the pathophysiology of AAT deficiency and emerging treatment options with particular focus on RNA editing as a disease-modifying treatment for both liver and lung disease."

    "abstract": "Hereditary liver diseases are rare conditions characterized by a wide variety of types and very low incidence rate for each one. Their clinical manifestations are diverse, and diagnosis often requires specialized testing, posing a high likelihood of missed or misdiagnosis. Systemic learning the basic knowledge and classification of hereditary liver diseases, as well as an understanding of the clinical features, laboratory findings, imaging, and pathological features of the relatively common hereditary liver diseases in adults, such as Wilson's disease, hemochromatosis, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, is essential. Targeted genetic testing can aid in the timely identification and correct diagnosis of these diseases. Once the etiology is revealed, appropriate treatment can often improve the clinical outcomes and quality of life. Cell therapy and gene therapy represent future directions and may offer the chance of cure for certain conditions. Currently, for patients who have progressed to end-stage liver disease, liver transplantation remains the ultimate treatment option and mostly yield excellent long-term prognosis if the indication and timing are appropriate."

    "abstract": "Evidence-based guidelines recommend screening all individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) for the genetic disorder alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD). However, it is estimated that only 5% of people with COPD have been tested for AATD, and a large fraction of the estimated 70,000 to 100,000 Americans with AATD have not yet been diagnosed. Low familiarity with AATD and limited knowledge about diagnostic tests and available treatments contribute to suboptimal screening rates. Our objective was to address barriers to and improve rates of guideline-based AATD diagnostic testing among racially and ethnically diverse patients with COPD at a large community health center. A quality improvement initiative consisting of educational sessions and electronic health record (EHR) system interventions was implemented to improve the adoption of guideline-based screening for AATD in patients with COPD. An analysis of EHR data demonstrated that among patients with a COPD diagnosis (n=1030), 22.2% (n=229) were screened for AATD in the 12 months following the start of the quality improvement initiative compared with 1.3% (n=13) of patients with a COPD diagnosis (n=972) seen in the 12 months prior to the start of the quality improvement initiative (<i>P</i><0.001). A quality improvement initiative consisting of educational sessions and EHR system modifications was successful in increasing clinicians' knowledge and diagnostic screening rates for AATD in patients with COPD at a large community health center."

    "abstract": "Biliary atresia (BA) is a rare condition of unknown origin in newborns with jaundice. In BA bile ducts are non-functional, causing neonatal cholestasis and following liver fibrosis and failure. This retrospective study included liver biopsies of 14 infants with BA aged [mean ± SD] 63 ± 23 days. Patients were grouped according to the clinical course (jaundice-free vs recurrent jaundice vs required liver transplantation or liver fibrosis (Ishak fibrosis score)) and followed for 1.61-5.64 years (mean 4.03). Transcriptome profiles were assessed using a panel of 768 fibrosis-specific genes, reanalyzed via qRT-PCR, and confirmed via immunostaining. Plasma from an additional 30 BA infants and 10 age-matched controls were used for amyloid precursor protein (APP) quantification by ELISA. Different clinical outcome groups showed a homogeneous mRNA expression. Altered amyloid-metabolism-related gene expression was found between cases with Ishak fibrosis score greater than 4. Immunostaining confirmed a distinct presence of APP in the livers of all BA subjects. APP plasma levels were higher in BA than in age-matched controls and correlated with the histological fibrosis grade. These results suggest that amyloidosis may contribute to BA and liver fibrosis, indicating that APP could serve as a potential liquid biomarker for these conditions. Biliary atresia patients with higher fibrosis scores according to Ishak have higher hepatic expression of amyloid-related genes while amyloid precursor protein accumulates in the liver and increases in the circulation. After a recent study revealed beta-amyloid deposition as a mechanism potentially involved in biliary atresia, we were able to correlate amyloid-metabolism-related transcript levels as well as amyloid precursor protein tissue and plasma levels with the degree of hepatic fibrosis. These findings suggest that amyloid precursor protein is a fibrosis marker in infants with biliary atresia, reinforcing the role of amyloid metabolism in the pathogenesis of this serious disease."

    "abstract": "α-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency is an inherited, genetic condition characterized by reduced serum levels of AAT and increased risk of developing emphysema and liver disease. AAT is normally synthesized primarily in the liver, but muscle-targeting with a recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vector for α-1 antitrypsin (AAT) gene therapy has been used to minimize liver exposure to the virus and hepatotoxicity. Clinical trials of direct intramuscular (IM) administration of rAAV1-hAAT have demonstrated its overall safety and transgene expression for 5 years. However, the failure to reach the therapeutic target level after 100 large-volume (1.5 mL) IM injections of maximally concentrated vector led us to pursue a muscle-targeting approach using isolated limb perfusion. This targets the rAAV to a greater muscle mass and allows for a higher total volume (and thereby a higher dose) than is tolerable by multiple direct IM injections. Limb perfusion has been shown to be feasible in non-human primates using the rAAV1 serotype and a ubiquitous promoter expressing an epitope-tagged AAT matched to the host species. In this study, we performed a biodistribution and preclinical safety study in non-human primates with a clinical candidate rAAV1-human AAT (hAAT) vector at doses ranging from 3.0 × 10<sup>12</sup> to 1.3 × 10<sup>13</sup> vg/kg, bracketing those used in our clinical trials. We found that limb perfusion delivery of rAAV1-hAAT was safe and showed a biodistribution pattern similar to previous studies. However, serum levels of AAT obtained with high-dose limb perfusion still reached only ~50% of the target serum levels. Our results suggest that clinically effective AAT gene therapy may ultimately require delivery at doses between 3.5 × 10<sup>13</sup>-1 × 10<sup>14</sup> vg/kg, which is within the dose range used for approved rAAV gene therapies. Muscle-targeting strategies could be incorporated when delivering systemic administration of high-dose rAAV gene therapies to increase transduction of muscle tissues and reduce the burden on the liver, especially in diseases that can present with hepatotoxicity such as AAT deficiency."

Most research on neutrophil function has been conducted under atmospheric conditions (21% O<sub>2</sub>), which may not represent physiological or pathological conditions. This study aimed to determine the effects of hypoxia on neutrophil degranulation and cytokine production in AATD patients. Neutrophils isolated from 54 AATD patients (31 MZ; 8 SZ; 15 ZZ) and 7 controls (MM) were exposed to hypoxia (1% O<sub>2</sub>) for 4 h. Neutrophil degranulation was assessed by measuring elastase (NE), myeloperoxidase (MPO), lactoferrin, and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) levels using immunoassay-based methods. Pro-inflammatory (IL-8, IL-1 beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha) and anti-inflammatory (IL-4 and IL-10) cytokine levels were assessed by a Luminex-based method. Our results indicate a significantly increased release of NE (<i>p</i> = 0.015), MPO (<i>p</i> = 0.042), lactoferrin (<i>p</i> = 0.015), and MMP-9 (<i>p</i> = 0.001) compared to controls.

    "abstract": "Liver cirrhosis is a significant global health burden, accounting for approximately 2 million deaths per year worldwide. The underlying etiologies of cirrhosis include viral hepatitis (hepatitis B, C, and D), toxins (such as alcohol and drugs), autoimmune diseases, cholestatic conditions (including primary biliary cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis), vascular disorders (such as Budd-Chiari syndrome, sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, and cardiac cirrhosis), and metabolic disorders (including hemochromatosis, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency). Patients with liver cirrhosis typically present with symptoms such as jaundice, scleral icterus, nausea, and vomiting, accompanied by abnormal liver enzyme levels. Other defining features include spider angiomas, caput medusa, and esophageal and/or rectal varices. Abdominal imaging often reveals fibrotic changes within the liver. In this article, we present a case of a 38-year-old female presenting with signs and symptoms of cirrhosis, with subsequent imaging revealing a Porta hepatis mass compressing the inferior vena cava (IVC). The patient underwent a biopsy consistent with liver cirrhosis. This case is unique in the presentation of her liver cirrhosis as a compressive mass rather than the usual fibrotic changes within the liver parenchyma."

    "abstract": "Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is an under-recognized condition with only a small minority of affected individuals detected, long delays between initial symptoms and diagnosis, and evidence that affected individuals may see many physicians with suggestive symptoms before an initial diagnosis is made. In the context that failure to detect AATD confers harm and that specific therapy is currently available, there is a clear need for enhanced detection. Impediments to enhanced detection include inadequate knowledge about AATD by physicians caring for at-risk patients, inattention to guidelines which endorse testing, a sense of therapeutic nihilism among some physicians (i.e., the misimpression that because specific therapy is unavailable, there is no imperative to diagnose), and concerns about the cost of testing. Various measures have been undertaken to address these impediments and to enhance detection, including educational programs; targeted detection programs (some with free and home-based confidential testing); population-based, and newborn screening pilot programs, the latter not yet nationally endorsed for large-scale screening. Novel approaches are deploying features of the electronic medical record and of artificial intelligence to prompt testing in at-risk individuals. To the extent that under-recognition of AATD persists with stubbornly long, multi-year diagnostic delay intervals, none of the detection strategies deployed to date has been adequately successful. The path forward regards continued innovation with targeted detection approaches while continuing efforts to assess the impact of population-based screening, hopefully toward ultimate endorsement on a broad national scale."

Machine-learning models may be trained to identify patients with rare diseases using large-scale, real-world databases, whereas electronic medical records have low numbers of confirmed cases and have limited use in training such models. We applied a machine-learning model to a large US claims database to identify undiagnosed symptomatic patients with AATD. Using deidentified data from the Komodo US claims database (April 26, 2016-January 31, 2023), a model was trained to identify symptomatic patients with high probability of AATD. Eighty claims records for high-probability candidates identified by the model were independently reviewed and validated by 2 clinical experts. The experts independently indicated that of the 80 high-probability candidate patients, 65 (81%) and 62 (78%) patients, respectively, should be tested for AATD. Feedback from this validation step informed model optimization. The optimized model was applied to claims data to identify symptomatic patients with probable AATD. Eleven and 14 \"features\" of the claims data were informative in distinguishing patients with AATD from patients with COPD without AATD and from unspecified chronic liver diseases. Moreover, patients with diagnosed AATD and COPD without AATD had unique cadences of similar medical events in their diagnostic journeys. Our work shows that a machine-learning model trained on a large US claims database can accurately identify symptomatic patients with AATD and provides useful insights into the diagnostic journey of patients with AATD."

Pi*Z AAT increases the risk of pulmonary emphysema and liver disease. Berberine (BBR) is a nature dietary supplement and herbal remedy. Emerging evidence revealed that BBR has remarkable liver-protective properties against various liver diseases. In the present study, we investigated the therapeutic effects and toxicities of BBR in Pi*Z hepatocytes and Pi*Z transgenic mice. Huh7.5 and Huh7.5Z (which carries the Pi*Z mutation) cells were treated with different concentrations of BBR for 48 hours. MTT was performed for cell viability assay. Intracellular AAT levels were evaluated by western blot. In vivo studies were carried out in wild type, native phenotype AAT (Pi*M), and Pi*Z AAT transgenic mice. Mice were treated with 50 mg/kg/day of BBR or solvent only by oral administration for 30 days. Western blot and liver histopathological examinations were performed to evaluate therapeutic benefits and liver toxicity of BBR. BBR reduced intracellular AAT levels in Huh7.5Z cells, meanwhile, no Pi*Z-specific toxicity was observed. However, BBR did not reduce liver AAT load but significantly potentiated liver inflammation and fibrosis accompanying the activation of unfolded protein response and mTOR in Pi*Z mice, but not in wild type and Pi*M mice. BBR exacerbated liver inflammation and fibrosis specifically in Pi*Z mice. This adverse effect may be associated with the activation of unfolded protein response and mTOR. This study implicates that BBR should be avoided by AATD patients."

Individual outcomes cannot be predicted. Liver injury in AATD is caused by the accumulation in hepatocytes of the mutant Z alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT) protein, especially the toxic, intracellular polymerized conformation. AATD patients have trace Z polymer detectable in serum with unknown significance. The Childhood Liver Disease Research Network is an NIH consortium for the study of pediatric liver diseases, including AATD. We obtained data and samples with the aim of identifying biomarkers predictive of severe AATD liver disease. We analyzed prospective AATD Childhood Liver Disease Research Network data and serum samples in 251 subjects from 2007 to 2015 for outcomes and Z polymer levels. Fifty-eight of 251 had clinically evident portal hypertension (CEPH) at enrollment, and 10 developed CEPH during follow-up. Higher Z AAT polymer levels were associated with existing CEPH (<i>P</i> = .01). In infants without CEPH, higher polymer levels were associated with future CEPH later in childhood, but total AAT was not predictive. Higher gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) in the first few months of life was also significantly associated with future CEPH, and risk-threshold GGT levels can be identified. A model was constructed to identify subjects at high risk of future CEPH by combining clinical GGT and polymer levels (area under the curve of 0.83; 95% confidence interval: 0.656-1.00, <i>P</i> = .019). High circulating Z polymer levels and high GGT early in life are associated with future CEPH in AATD, and the use of predictive cutoffs may assist in future clinical trial design."

PI∗Z and PI∗S alleles are the most diagnosed causes of AATD, but the role of the SERPINA1 haplotypes in AAT function remains unknown. SERPINA1 gene was PCR amplified from 94 patients with asthma, using primers with tails for indexing. Sequencing libraries were loaded into a MinION-Mk1C, and MinKNOW was used for basecalling and demultiplexing. Nanofilt and Minimap2 were used for filtering and mapping/alignment. Variant calling/phasing were performed with PEPPER-Margin-DeepVariant. SERPINA1 gene was 100% covered for all samples, with a minimum sequencing depth of 500×. A total of 75 single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and 4 insertions/deletions were detected, with 45 and 2 of them highly polymorphic (minor allele frequency >0.1), respectively. Nine of the SNVs showed differences in allele frequencies when compared with the overall Spanish population. More than 90% of heterozygous SNVs were phased, yielding 91 and 58 different haplotypes for each SERPINA1 amplified region. Haplotype-based linkage disequilibrium analysis suggests that a recombination hotspot could generate variation in the SERPINA1 gene. The proposed workflow enables haplotype-aware genotyping of the SERPINA1 gene by nanopore sequencing, which will allow the development of novel AATD diagnostic strategies."

Steatosis did not correlate to fibrosis. Increased fibrosis was associated with increased mutant Z polymer globular inclusions (p = .002) and increased diffuse cytoplasmic Z polymer on biopsy (p = .0029) in a direct relationship. Increased globule Z polymer was associated with increased serum AST (p = .007) and increased periportal inflammation on histopathology (p = .004), but there was no relationship of Z polymer hepatocellular accumulation with ALT, gamma glutamine transferase, inflammation in other parts of the lobule, necrosis or steatosis. Serum Z polymer levels were directly correlated to hepatic Z protein polymer content. Lung function, smoking and alcohol consumption patterns were not associated with fibrosis. In AATD high BMI, obesity and elevated AST are associated with increased fibrosis. Liver biopsy features are correlated to some serum tests.

    "abstract": "The bacterium Clostridium botulinum, well-known for producing botulinum neurotoxins, which cause the severe paralytic illness known as botulism, produces C2 toxin, a binary AB-toxin with ADP-ribosyltranferase activity. C2 toxin possesses two separate protein components, an enzymatically active A-component C2I and the binding and translocation B-component C2II. After proteolytic activation of C2II to C2IIa, the heptameric structure binds C2I and is taken up via receptor-mediated endocytosis into the target cells. Due to acidification of endosomes, the C2IIa/C2I complex undergoes conformational changes and consequently C2IIa forms a pore into the endosomal membrane and C2I can translocate into the cytoplasm, where it ADP-ribosylates G-actin, a key component of the cytoskeleton. This modification disrupts the actin cytoskeleton, resulting in the collapse of cytoskeleton and ultimately cell death. Here, we show that the serine-protease inhibitor α<sub>1</sub>-antitrypsin (α<sub>1</sub>AT) which we identified previously from a hemofiltrate library screen for PT from Bordetella pertussis is a multitoxin inhibitor. α<sub>1</sub>AT inhibits intoxication of cells with C2 toxin via inhibition of binding to cells and inhibition of enzyme activity of C2I. Moreover, diphtheria toxin and an anthrax fusion toxin are inhibited by α<sub>1</sub>AT. Since α<sub>1</sub>AT is commercially available as a drug for treatment of the α<sub>1</sub>AT deficiency, it could be repurposed for treatment of toxin-mediated diseases."

The study intervention was placing a reminder to test for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency within an electronic medical record health maintenance dashboard that houses prompts to providers to implement guideline-based recommendations. This recommendation was for all patients assigned a diagnosis of COPD based on relevant International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision codes. The rate of testing for and detecting individuals with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency was assessed in 12 one-month intervals before and after implementing the dashboard. After the prompt, whereas testing was still performed in only a small percentage of guideline-concordant instances, the rate of testing for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency increased 3.8-fold (ie, from 1.2% to 4.6%, <i>P</i> < .05). This did not result in detection of new patients with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. The rate of testing increased both for alpha-1 antitrypsin serum levels and genotypes in each month after the intervention, though the rate of genotype testing was 2-5-fold lower than the rate of testing for serum level. The results of this preliminary study of a detection strategy for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency show that placing a reminder to test for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency when indicated in an electronic medical record health maintenance dashboard significantly increased the frequency of testing. Still, that only 4.6% of those in whom testing for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency was indicated were tested in the post-intervention period shows that, as for all other alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency-targeted detection interventions to date, the impact of the intervention was marginal and that other strategies remain needed to mitigate underrecognition. A focus on combining targeted detection strategies (eg, coupling enhanced awareness with free testing) and population-based screening for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is suggested."

    "title": "Drug-induced liver injury related to gene therapy: A new challenge to be managed.",
    "abstract": "Gene therapy is being successfully developed for the treatment of several genetic disorders. Various methods of gene transfer have been developed to enable the production of the deficient enzyme or protein. One of the most important is adeno-associated virus vectors, which have been shown to be viable for use in in vivo gene therapy. Several gene therapies have already been approved. They are also promising for acquired diseases. Important examples include gene therapy for haemophilia A and B, X-linked myotubular myopathy, spinal muscular atrophy and several liver diseases such as Criggler-Najjar disease, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency and Fabry disease. However, the introduction of a foreign compound into hepatocytes leads to hepatic reactions with heterogeneous phenotypic expression and a wide spectrum of severity, ranging from mild transaminase elevation to acute liver failure. Several mechanisms appear to be involved in liver injury, including an immune response, but also direct toxicity depending on the method of gene transfer. As a result, the incidence, expression and severity of liver injury vary from indication to indication and from patient to patient. Patients treated for haemophilia A are more prone to transaminase elevation than those treated for haemophilia B. Corticosteroids are successfully used to correct liver reactions but also to prevent degradation of the transferred gene and loss of therapeutic activity. The aim of this review is to describe the risk of liver injury according to the indication for gene therapy and the short- and long-term management currently proposed to prevent or correct liver reactions in clinical practice."

To evaluate the impact of clinical parameters and AATD phenotypes, particularly the Pi*Z allele, in liver fibrosis. Cross-sectional cohort study including consecutive patients with AATD followed in Pulmonology or Hepatology consultation. Included 69 patients, 49.3% had Pi*MZ phenotype and 10.1% Pi*ZZ. An age ≥ 55 years, age at diagnosis ≥ 41 years and AAT at diagnosis < 77 mg/dL predicted a nonalcoholic fatty liver disease fibrosis score (NFS) not excluding advanced fibrosis [area under the curve (AUC) = 0.840, <i>P</i> < 0.001; AUC = 0.836, <i>P</i> < 0.001; AUC = 0.681, <i>P</i> = 0.025].

    "abstract": "Bronchiectasis occurs in patients with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD), but it is unknown whether an association exists independently of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We assessed whether bronchiectasis was associated with COPD in our cohort, and whether it has clinical significance for lung function decline, exacerbation rate, or symptoms. PiZZ, PiSZ, and PiMZ patients from the Birmingham AATD Research Database were studied. Demographics were recorded, along with the outcomes of symptoms, forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV<sub>1</sub>), transfer factor of carbon monoxide (TLCO), carbon monoxide transfer coefficient (KCO), and annualized exacerbation rate. Lung function decline was calculated for those with ≥3 measurements. Multivariate regression analyses were conducted to assess for associations of bronchiectasis with each outcome. A further binomial logistic regression model assessed for predictors of bronchiectasis diagnosis, including COPD. Those with alternative bronchiectasis causes were excluded from statistical models. A total of 1290 patients were eligible. PiZZ patients with bronchiectasis were older at presentation (54 versus 49 years, <i>p</i><0.001), less likely to have smoked (65% versus 76.1%, <i>p</i>=0.001), and had higher modified Medical Research Council scores (mMRC) (mMRC 2 versus 0 odds ratio [OR] 1.97, 95% constant interval [CI] 1.20-3.25, <i>p</i>=0.008; mMRC 3 versus 0 OR 2.58 95% CI 1.59-4.19, <i>p</i><0.001; mMRC 4 versus 0 OR 2.2 95% CI 1.23-3.92; <i>p</i>=0.008) than those without. The OR of bronchiectasis diagnosis was not associated with COPD diagnosis in any phenotype. Bronchiectasis was associated with lower serum alpha-1 antitrypsin levels in PiZZ patients (<i>p</i>=0.012). Bronchiectasis was not associated with a difference in FEV<sub>1</sub> percentage predicted (pp)/year decline, KCO pp/year, TLCO pp/year decline, or exacerbation rate in multivariate analysis. Bronchiectasis exists in a significant minority of AATD patients independently of COPD and is associated with more severe shortness of breath. Appropriate treatment of bronchiectasis in AATD is essential."

Laboratory investigations showed severe hypoproteinemia, fat malabsorption with fat-soluble vitamin deficiency, and significant protein loss in the stool. Imaging studies revealed pulmonary edema, ascites, bowel wall edema, and a duodenal polyp. Further evaluating the duodenal polyp, a grade two duodenal neuroendocrine tumor (NET) was identified. She was managed with subcutaneous octreotide and duodenal polypectomy, resulting in significant clinical improvement. This case highlights the importance of diagnosing and managing protein-losing enteropathy secondary to gastric neuroendocrine tumors."

    "abstract": "Severe inherited alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is an autosomal genetic condition linked to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The significance of heterozygous, milder deficiency variants (PiSZ, PiMZ, PiMS) is less clear. We studied AATD genotypes in 145 children (up to 72 months old) with assessed wheezing severity using the Pediatric Respiratory Assessment Measure (BCCH PRAM score). A control group of 74 children without airway obstruction was included. AAT concentration and Pi phenotype were determined from dry blood spot samples using nephelometry and real-time PCR; PiS and PiZ alleles were identified by isoelectrofocusing. Among the wheezers, the Pi*S allele incidence was 2.07% (3 cases) and the Pi*Z allele was 6.9% (10 cases). The Pi*Z allele frequency was higher in wheezers compared to controls (44.8% vs. 20.27%) and the general Lithuanian population (44.8% vs. 13.6%) and was similar to adult COPD patients in Lithuania: Pi*S 10.3% vs. 15.8% and Pi*Z 44.8% vs. 46.1%. No association was found between AAT genotypes and wheezing severity. Finding that wheezer children exhibit a frequency of Z* and S* alleles like that found in adults with COPD suggests a potential genetic predisposition that links early wheezing in children to the development of COPD in adulthood. Larger cohort studies are needed to confirm this finding."

    "abstract": "Currently, there is conflicting information and guidance on the effective management of Alpha 1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (AATD). Establishing a consensus of assessment and disease management specific to AATD is important for achieving a standardized treatment pathway and for improving patient outcomes. Here, we aim to utilize the Delphi method to establish a European consensus for the assessment and management of patients with severe AATD. Two rounds of a Delphi survey were completed online by members of the European Alpha-1 Research Collaboration (EARCO). Respondents were asked to indicate their agreement with proposed statements for patients with no respiratory symptoms, stable respiratory disease, and worsening respiratory disease using a Likert scale of 1-7. Levels of agreement between respondents were calculated using a weighted average. Round 1 of the Delphi survey was sent to 103 members of EARCO and 38/103 (36.9%) pulmonologists from across 15 countries completed all 109 questions. Round 2 was sent to all who completed Round 1 and 36/38 (94.7%) completed all 79 questions. Responses regarding spirometry, body plethysmography, high-resolution computed tomography, and the initiation of augmentation therapy showed little variability among physicians, but there was discordance among other aspects, such as the use of low-dose computed tomography in both a research setting and routine clinical care. These results provide expert opinions for the assessment and monitoring of patients with severe AATD, which could be used to provide updated recommendations and standardized treatment pathways for patients across Europe."

    "abstract": "The existence of alpha-1 antitrypsin variants with apparently unremarkable phenotypes and serum concentrations, contrasting with a clinical picture suggestive of a severe deficiency, led us to investigate whether in these cases there was a reduction or even suppression of the capacity of alpha-1 antitrypsin to inhibit elastase. To this end, in two different laboratories, we adapted and validated a method for measuring the functional activity of alpha-1 antitrypsin, based on spectrophotometric kinetic analysis of the inhibition by serum alpha-1 antitrypsin of the hydrolytic activity of porcine pancreatic elastase on a chromogenic substrate. This method has proved to be robust, reproducible and transferable and made possible to define, on the basis of an analysis of a hospital population, a functionality index with a confidence interval comprised between 0.87 and 1.2, allowing to identify subjects likely to have a functional deficiency of alpha-1 antitrypsin, whether this deficiency being of a genetic origin without any quantitative or phenotypic translation, or whether being acquired under the effect of external agents (cigarette smoke or viruses)."

(1) To determine the differential diagnosis of IC among Saudi population and (2) to evaluate the usefulness of a diagnostic algorithm that has been tailored by the authors to the local practice. All infants with onset of cholestasis before 12 months of age (2007 and 2020) were identified and included if they underwent extensive work up to exclude infectious, structural, metabolic, endocrine, infiltrative, and familial causes. Our diagnostic pathway allowed a definite diagnosis in 373 of the included 533 cases; 160 (30%) were labelled as \"idiopathic neonatal hepatitis\" (INH) [i.e., overall 70% detection rate]. However, when considering the cases that underwent extensive investigations including advanced gene testing (415 of the 533), the yield of the diagnostic algorithm was 90% (373/415). Familial cholestasis group was the most common in 20% (107/533), and biliary atresia and neonatal-onset Dubin Johnson syndrome contributed to 6% each. The genetic/hereditary causes of cholestasis contributed to 58% of the diagnosed cases (217/373). No single case of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency was diagnosed. Forty-nine infants with cholestasis presented with liver failure (9%). Our study highlights several unique features and causes of IC among Arabs which could have a great impact on the differential diagnosis process and the choice of laboratory tests used in the clinical setting."

    "abstract": "Severe alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is associated with an increased risk of emphysema. However, the clinical manifestations are very heterogeneous, and an individual prognosis is very difficult to establish. Intravenous augmentation therapy with alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) from pooled blood donors is the only specific treatment available, but it requires weekly or biweekly administration for life. Several guidelines provide the indication criteria for the initiation of AAT augmentation therapy. However, in clinical practice, there are situations in which the decision as to when to start treatment becomes uncertain and some studies have shown great variability in the indication of this treatment even among specialists. The usual dilemma is between initiating augmentation therapy in individuals who may not develop significant lung disease or in whom disease will not progress or delaying it in patients who may otherwise rapidly and irreversibly progress. We illustrate this dilemma with five clinical cases: from the case of a patient with normal lung function who requests initiation of therapy to a moderately stable patient without augmentation or a mild patient who, after several years of remaining stable without treatment, deterioration in lung function initiated and, consequently, augmentation therapy was begun. All the nuances associated with the indication of augmentation justify a personalised approach and the decision about initiating augmentation therapy must be made after careful consideration of the pros and cons with the patient in reference centres with experience in treatment. These reference centres can work in collaboration with local hospitals where patients can be closely followed and augmentation therapy can be administered to avoid unnecessary travelling, making periodical administrations more comfortable for the patient."

    "abstract": "The pathogenesis of sarcoidosis involves tissue remodelling mediated by the accumulation of abnormal extracellular matrix, which is partly the result of an imbalance in collagen synthesis, cross-linking and degradation. During this process, collagen fragments or neoepitopes, are released into the circulation. The significance of these circulating collagen neoepitopes in sarcoidosis remains unknown. We employed plasma samples from patients with sarcoidosis enrolled in A Case Control Etiologic Study of Sarcoidosis (ACCESS) and Genomic Research in Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency and Sarcoidosis (GRADS), and healthy control patients recruited from the Yale community. Plasma concentrations of type III and VI collagen degradation (C3M and C6M) and formation (PRO-C3 and PRO-C6) were quantified via neoepitope-specific competitive ELISA, and statistical associations were sought with clinical phenotypes. Relative to healthy controls, the plasma of both sarcoidosis cohorts was enriched for C3M and C6M, irrespective of corticosteroid use and disease duration. While circulating collagen neoepitopes were independent of Scadding stage, there was a significant association between multiorgan disease and PRO-C3, PRO-C6 and C3M in the ACCESS cohort; PRO-C3 and C6M displayed this property in GRADS. These findings were unrelated to plasma levels of interleukin-4 (IL-4), IL-5, IL-6, IL-9, IL-10 and IL-13. Moreover, PRO-C3 was associated with dermatological disease in both cohorts. In two well-characterised sarcoidosis cohorts, we discovered that the plasma is enriched for neoepitopes of collagen degradation (C3M and C6M). In multiorgan disease, there was an association with circulating neoepitopes of type III formation (PRO-C3), perhaps mediated by dermatological sarcoidosis. Further investigation in this arena has the potential to foster new insights into the pathogenic mechanisms of this complex disease."

    "abstract": "Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency, characterized by reduced synthesis of a serine protease inhibitor in liver cells, has been recognized to contribute to the development of emphysema and liver disease. Additional clinical manifestations encompassing respiratory disorders and dermatological issues have also been documented. A 56-year-old male patient presented with dyspnea. Despite being a non-smoker, he had a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) five years ago. Utilizing inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) - long-acting β2-agonists (LABAs)- long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs) inhalers, the patient's medical treatment had ceased for the past four months due to inhaler depletion. High-resolution thoracic computed tomography unveiled bilateral emphysematous regions, predominantly located in the lower pulmonary lobes. In light of the absence of smoking history, the suspicion of AAT deficiency was raised, prompting the assessment of serum AAT levels. Subsequent analysis indicated diminished AAT levels, prompting the collection of a dried blood sample for genetic evaluation. Genomic DNA amplification was performed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), succeeded by allele-specific hybridization via Luminex XMAP Technology. This analysis disclosed a Q0amersfoort (Exon 2 Y160TAC > Ter TAG) (+/+) variant linked with AAT deficiency, originating from a frame-shift mutation that triggers a null (Q0amersfoort) stop codon. The presentation of COPD-related emphysema in a non-smoker underscores the necessity to consider AAT deficiency in the differential diagnosis."

This was a retrospective, observational analysis of administrative claims data from the IQVIA PharMetrics<sup>®</sup> Plus and Ambulatory Electronic Medical Records databases from 2011 to 2022. Patients had a diagnosis of liver and/or lung disease with ≥180 days of continuous enrollment in the IQVIA PharMetrics Plus database before and ≥90 days after their first diagnosis. Follow-up time was assigned to the AATD with liver disease health state or AATD with both liver and lung disease health state (for patients aged ≥18 years only). Baseline demographic characteristics and liver-related clinical events of interest were reported. Of 5136 eligible patients, 771 adult and 123 pediatric patients contributed time to the AATD with liver disease health state; 541 adults contributed time to the AATD with both liver and lung disease health state. Among adults, patients with both liver and lung disease had higher rates of liver-related clinical events than patients with liver disease alone. Ascites was the most frequently observed clinical event among adults in both health states, and the median time to the composite of any liver-related clinical event was 26.5 days among all adults combined. Across all pediatric age groups, ascites, gastrointestinal bleed and hepatic encephalopathy were more common than spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and hepatocellular carcinoma, but median time to liver-related clinical event varied by age group at index date and type of event. No liver transplantations occurred in patients aged 6-17 years. Diagnosed AATD with liver disease carries a substantial burden on adult and pediatric patients; new treatment options are warranted to avoid disease progression to decompensating events."

Cohort (ii) included measurements of carbohydrate-deficient transferrin (CDT). In both cohorts, no/low alcohol intake was reported by >80% of individuals, while harmful consumption was rare (~1%). Among Pi*MM and Pi*MZ individuals from cohort (i), moderate alcohol consumption resulted in a <30% increased rate of elevated transaminases and ~50% increase in elevated gamma-glutamyl transferase values, while harmful alcohol intake led to an at least twofold increase in the abnormal levels. In Pi*ZZ individuals from both cohorts, moderate alcohol consumption had no marked impact on serum transaminase levels. Among Pi*ZZ subjects from cohort (ii) who reported no/low alcohol consumption, those with increased CDT levels more often had signs of advanced liver disease. Pi*MZ/Pi*ZZ genotype does not seem to markedly aggravate the hepatic toxicity of moderate alcohol consumption. CDT values might be helpful to detect alcohol consumption in those with advanced fibrosis. More data are needed to evaluate the impact of harmful alcohol consumption."

A total of 836 (431 PiZZ, 405 PiMZ) adults with AATD and 312 controls (PiMM) from the European Alpha-1 Liver Cohort (2015-2020) were included. Time-to-event analyses were conducted for adults with the PiZZ genotype followed for adverse clinical outcomes (earliest occurrence of liver-related hospitalization, liver transplant or all-cause mortality). Cox proportional hazard models were used to describe the association between binary circulating Z-polymer levels and adverse clinical outcomes. Correlations between baseline circulating Z-polymer levels and baseline liver fibrosis (liver stiffness measurement [LSM] determined by transient elastography [FibroScan®]) were evaluated. The analyses were stratified by augmentation therapy status. Of 324 adults with the PiZZ genotype and longitudinal follow-up data, 28 reported adverse clinical outcomes. Higher baseline circulating Z-polymer levels were associated with an increased risk of adverse clinical outcomes in both crude (hazard ratio [95% confidence interval, CI], 2.88 [1.21, 6.87]) and age-adjusted (1.96 [0.78, 4.94]) analyses. In adults with the PiZZ genotype, circulating Z-polymer levels were weakly positively correlated with baseline LSM (Spearman's rho [95% CI]: 0.21 [0.11, 0.31]). Similar results were observed after stratification by augmentation therapy status. In adults with the PiZZ genotype, higher circulating Z-polymer levels were associated with a shorter time to adverse clinical outcome, and positively correlated with baseline LSM. Circulating Z-polymer levels may be a prognostic biomarker of clinically relevant disease in AATD."

    "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a genetic condition resulting from mutations in the alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) protein, a major systemic antiproteinase, resulting in reduced/no release of AAT, disrupting the proteinase/antiproteinase balance. A sustained imbalance can cause structural changes to the lung parenchyma, leading to emphysema. Predicting and assessing human responses to potential therapeutic candidates from preclinical animal studies have been challenging. Our aims were to develop a more physiologically relevant <i>in vitro</i> model of the proteinase/antiproteinase balance and assess whether the data generated could better predict the efficacy of pharmacological candidates to inform decisions on clinical trials, together with expected biomarker responses. <b>Methods:</b> We developed an <i>in vitro</i> model assessing the proteinase/antiproteinase balance by the changes in the fibrinogen cleavage products of neutrophil elastase (NE) and proteinase 3 (PR3). This allowed the assessment of physiological and pharmaceutical neutrophil serine proteinase (NSP) inhibitors to determine the putative threshold at which the maximal effect is achieved. <b>Results:</b> AAT significantly reduced NE and PR3 activity footprints, with the maximal reduction achieved at concentrations above 10 μM. The inhibitor MPH966 alone also significantly reduced NE footprint generation in a concentration-dependent manner, leveling out above 100 nM but had no effect on the PR3 footprint. At levels of AAT consistent with AATD, MPH966 had an additive effect, reducing the NE activity footprint more than either inhibitor alone. <b>Conclusion:</b> Our results support an inhibitor threshold above which the activity footprint generation appears resistant to increasing dosage. Our model can support the testing of inhibitors, confirming activity biomarkers as indicators of likely pharmaceutical efficacy, the assessment of NSP activity in the pathophysiology of emphysema, and the likely function of biological or pharmacological inhibitors in disease management."

However, AATD remains underdiagnosed even in high-prevalence and low-prevalence regions, possibly because of lack of awareness. In this study, we surveyed open Japanese genetic variation databases to estimate AATD prevalence in Japan. We identified allelic frequencies (AFs) of 5 among the 14 major pathogenic SERPINA1 variants from three datasets, collectively derived from 63,119 Japanese participants. The mean AF was determined to be 8.56 × 10<sup>-4</sup> (95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.43 × 10<sup>-4</sup> to 1.12 × 10<sup>-3</sup>). Given that this represents the entire Japanese population, one AATD patient was speculated to be born per 1.37 × 10<sup>6</sup> births (95% CI: 7.97 × 10<sup>5</sup> to 2.42 × 10<sup>6</sup>) in Japan. Our results support the prevailing notion that AATD is extremely rare in Japan."

    "abstract": "A 13-year-old male with a past medical history of receiving a whole liver transplant secondary to alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) with subsequent inferior vena cava thrombosis nine years prior presented to the emergency department with abdominal distension, shortness of breath, coughing, and left superficial cervical lymphadenopathy. He had seen his pediatrician the day before where he tested negative for group A <i>Streptococcus</i>, influenza, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Additionally, the patient reported having elevated liver function tests noted from the results of lab tests taken earlier that day. The patient was admitted to the hospital. While at the hospital, a lymph node biopsy was performed, and pathology from that biopsy revealed infectious mononucleosis-like nondestructive posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD). Due to the patient's liver transplant nine years prior, the patient was on an immunosuppressant medication: tacrolimus 2 mg. To treat the PTLD, the tacrolimus was reduced, then stopped, and then subsequently restarted at 1 mg. He also was given ganciclovir and prednisone. Two months after recovering from the PTLD, the patient's Epstein-Barr-virus (EBV) viral load continued to fluctuate, and he was treated with three doses of the monoclonal antibody drug rituximab. After treatment with rituximab, his EBV viral load remained stable. This case report gives insight into the treatment of PTLD and can serve as a reminder to be aware of the possibility of PTLD in a pediatric patient with AATD multiple years after a transplant."

    "abstract": "Cholestasis causes accumulation of bile acids (BAs) and changes the circulating bile acid profile. Quantification of circulating BAs in dried bloodspots (DBS) may demonstrate obstruction of bile flow and altered bile acid metabolism in the liver. High sample throughput enables rapid screening of cholestatic diseases. Ultra high performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) was used for optimizing separation and detection of the primary unconjugated BAs cholic acid (CA) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA); the secondary unconjugated BAs ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), hyodeoxycholic acid (HDCA) and deoxycholic acid (DCA), as well as the glycine- and taurine-conjugated variants of CA, CDCA, DCA and UDCA. Donor blood was obtained to prepare DBS calibrators and quality controls for method development and validation. We developed a quantitative bile acid assay with a run-time of two minutes, and one-step sample preparation of 3.2 mm DBS discs. Validation results demonstrated overall good performance and was considered fit for purpose. Children with Alagille syndrome, Aagenaes syndrome and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency had increased BAs in DBS from newborn screening samples compared with age matched controls, and had different bile acids profiles. We propose that our high throughput assay allows bile acid profiling in DBS that can be a valuable assessment tool for early screening of cholestasis in children. Assaying BAs in dried bloodspots is key for early detection of cholestasis, and provides transferability to a newborn screening setting."

    "abstract": "Homozygous ZZ alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency produces mutant AAT (Z-AAT) proteins in hepatocytes, leading to progressive liver fibrosis. We evaluated the safety and efficacy of an investigational RNA interference therapeutic, fazirsiran, that degrades Z-AAT messenger RNA, reducing deleterious protein synthesis. This ongoing, phase 2 study randomized 40 patients to subcutaneous placebo or fazirsiran 25, 100, or 200 mg. The primary endpoint was percent change in serum Z-AAT concentration from baseline to week 16. Patients with fibrosis on baseline liver biopsy received treatment on day 1, at week 4, and then every 12 weeks and had a second liver biopsy at or after weeks 48, 72, or 96. Patients without fibrosis received 2 doses on day 1 and at week 4. At week 16, least-squares mean percent declines in serum Z-AAT concentration were -61%, -83%, and -94% with fazirsiran 25, 100, and 200 mg, respectively, vs placebo (all P < .0001). Efficacy was sustained through week 52. At postdose liver biopsy, fazirsiran reduced median liver Z-AAT concentration by 93% compared with an increase of 26% with placebo. All fazirsiran-treated patients had histologic reduction from baseline in hepatic globule burden. Portal inflammation improved in 5 of 12 and 0 of 8 patients with a baseline score of >0 in the fazirsiran and placebo groups, respectively. Histologic meta-analysis of histologic data in viral hepatitis score improved by >1 point in 7 of 14 and 3 of 8 patients with fibrosis of >F0 at baseline in the fazirsiran and placebo groups, respectively. No adverse events led to discontinuation, and pulmonary function tests remained stable. Fazirsiran reduced serum and liver concentrations of Z-AAT in a dose-dependent manner and reduced hepatic globule burden. (ClinicalTrials.gov, Number NCT03945292)."

    "abstract": "Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (A1ATD) is a life-threatening condition caused by the inheritance of the serpin family A member 1 \"Z\" genetic variant driving alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) protein misfolding in hepatocytes. There are no approved medicines for this disease. We conducted a high-throughput image-based small molecule screen using patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cell-hepatocytes (iPSC-hepatocytes). Identified targets were validated in vitro using 3 independent patient iPSC lines. The effects of the identified target, leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2), were further evaluated in an animal model of A1ATD through histology and immunohistochemistry and in an autophagy-reporter line. Autophagy induction was assessed through immunoblot and immunofluorescence analyses. Small-molecule screen performed in iPSC-hepatocytes identified LRRK2 as a potentially new therapeutic target. Of the commercially available LRRK2 inhibitors tested, we identified CZC-25146, a candidate with favorable pharmacokinetic properties, as capable of reducing polymer load, increasing normal AAT secretion, and reducing inflammatory cytokines in both cells and PiZ mice. Mechanistically, this effect was achieved through the induction of autophagy. Our findings support the use of CZC-25146 and leucine-rich repeat kinase-2 inhibitors in hepatic proteinopathy research and their further investigation as novel therapeutic candidates for A1ATD."

The clinical and biological data of 45 patients with homozygous or compound heterozygous AATD were analysed. The data were collected retrospectively going back to 2005 and prospectively from May 2020 until October 2021. It was based on questionnaires, laboratory values, sonography, and biopsy findings. Liver disease was classified into four grades depending on the grade of liver disease: mild or no liver disease, moderate disease, severe disease, and liver transplantation. Thirty-nine patients (86.7%) had a Pi*ZZ and five (11.1%) a Pi*SZ genotype. One patient showed a new, not-yet-described compound heterozygous genotype (Pi*Z + Asp95Asn). A total of 66.7% of the cohort showed mild or no liver disease, 20% moderate, and 13.3% severe. AATD was diagnosed in most cases because of liver abnormalities, such as the elevation of transaminases (42.2%). A total of 29.4% of the patients with neonatal icterus prolongatus developed severe liver disease, and 25.7% were born small for their gestational age (SGA). Diseases of the atopic type were reported in 47.4% of the cases. The presence of neonatal icterus prolongatus in the first weeks of life was significantly more likely in severe courses of liver disease (r = 0.371, <i>p</i> = 0.012). A tendency toward atopic comorbidity in AAT-deficient children needs to be further evaluated."

Our study aimed to characterize this genotype and its risk for lung disease and compare it with the PI*ZZ and PI*SZ genotypes using data from the European Alpha-1 antitrypsin Deficiency Research Collaboration international registry. Demographic, clinical, functional, and quality of life (QoL) parameters were assessed to compare the PI*SS characteristics with the PI*SZ and PI*ZZ controls. A propensity score with 1:3 nearest-neighbour matching was performed for the most important confounding variables. The study included 1007 individuals, with PI*SS (n = 56; 5.6%), PI*ZZ (n = 578; 57.4%) and PI*SZ (n = 373; 37.0%). The PI*SS population consisted of 58.9% men, with a mean age of 59.2 years and a mean FEV1(% predicted) of 83.4%. Compared to PI*ZZ individuals they had less frequent lung disease (71.4% vs. 82.2%, p = 0.037), COPD (41.4% vs. 60%, p = 0.002), and emphysema (23.2% vs. 51.9%, p < 0.001) and better preserved lung function, fewer exacerbations, lower level of dyspnoea, and better QoL. In contrast, no significant differences were found in the prevalence of lung diseases between PI*SS and PI*SZ, or lung function parameters, exacerbations, dyspnoea, or QoL. We found that, as expected, the risk of lung disease associated with the PI*SS genotype is significantly lower compared with PI*ZZ, but does not differ from that observed in PI*SZ individuals, despite having higher serum AAT levels. www. gov (ID: NCT04180319)."

By harnessing recent biotechnological advancements, this review aims to equip researchers and clinicians with a comprehensive and updated understanding of the evolving treatment landscape for metabolic and genetic disorders, highlighting how iPSCs provide a unique platform for detailed pathological modeling and pharmacological testing, driving forward precision medicine and drug discovery. Concurrently, CRISPR-Cas9 offers unprecedented precision in gene correction, presenting potential curative therapies that move beyond symptomatic treatment. Therefore, this review examines the transformative role of iPSC technology and CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing in addressing metabolic and genetic disorders such as alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (A1AD) and glycogen storage disease (GSD), which significantly impact liver and pulmonary health and pose substantial challenges in clinical management. In addition, this review discusses significant achievements alongside persistent challenges such as technical limitations, ethical concerns, and regulatory hurdles. Future directions, including innovations in gene-editing accuracy and therapeutic delivery systems, are emphasized for next-generation therapies that leverage the full potential of iPSC and CRISPR-Cas9 technologies."

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is the prime example of a pulmonary vascular disease, which can be caused by genetic mutations in some patients. Germline mutations in the BMPR2 gene and further genes lead to vessel remodelling, increase of pulmonary vascular resistance and onset of heritable PAH. The PAH genes with the highest evidence and strategies for genetic testing and counselling have been assessed and evaluated in 2023 by international expert consortia. Moreover, first treatment options have just arisen targeting the molecular basis of PAH. Apart from PAH, this review touches on the underlying genetic causes of further lung diseases including alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency, cystic fibrosis, familial pulmonary fibrosis and lymphangioleiomyomatosis. We point out the main disease genes, the underlying pathomechanisms and novel therapies trying not only to relieve symptoms but to treat the molecular causes of the diseases."

At the recommended dose, A<sub>1</sub>-PI products raise its serum concentration but do not normalize levels.

AAT is a vital regulator of neutrophil functions, and its qualitative and/or quantitative defects have significant implications for the development of respiratory diseases. Whole blood from 12 healthy women age years, mean (SD) 29.92 (5.48) was collected twice daily, 8 h apart, and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C alone or with additions of 2 mg/ml AAT (Respreeza) and/or 5 μg/ml lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Escherichia coli. Neutrophils were then isolated to examine gene expression, migration and phagocytosis. The expression of CD14, CD16, CXCR2 and SELL (encoding CD62L) genes was significantly higher while CDKN1A lower in the afternoon than in the morning neutrophils from untreated blood. Neutrophils isolated in the afternoon had higher migratory and phagocytic activity. Morning neutrophils isolated from AAT-pretreated blood showed higher expression of CXCR2 and SELL than those from untreated morning blood. Pretreatment of blood with AAT enhanced migratory properties of morning but not afternoon neutrophils. Of all genes analysed, only CXCL8 expression was strongly upregulated in morning and afternoon neutrophils isolated from LPS-pretreated blood, whereas CXCR2 expression was downregulated in afternoon neutrophils. The addition of AAT did not reverse the effects of LPS. The circadian clock of myeloid cells may affect the effectiveness of various therapies, including AAT therapy used to treat patients with AAT deficiency, and needs further investigation."

    "abstract": "As a result of climate change, wildfire frequency, duration, and severity are increasing in the United States. Exposure to wildfire-related air pollutants can lead to negative health outcomes, particularly among patients with preexisting respiratory diseases (e.g., asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) and those who are at higher risk for developing these conditions. Underserved communities are disproportionately affected for multiple reasons, including lack of financial and social resources, increased exposure to air pollutants at home and at work, and impaired access to health care. To best serve clinically high-risk and underserved populations, health systems must leverage community public health data, develop and mobilize a wildfire preparedness action plan to identify populations at high risk, and implement interventions to mitigate the consequences of poor air quality. University of California, Davis Health, located at the epicenter of the largest wildfires in California's history, has developed the 5 pillar Wildfire Population Health Approach: (1) identify clinically at-risk and underserved patient populations using well-validated, condition-targeted registries; (2) assemble multidisciplinary care teams to understand the needs of these communities and patients; (3) create custom analytics and wildfire-risk stratification; (4) develop care pathways based on wildfire-risk tiers by disease, risk of exposure, and health care access; and (5) identify outcome measures tailored to interventions with a commitment to continuous, iterative improvement efforts. The Wildfire Population Health Approach provides an action plan for health systems and care teams to meet the needs of clinically at-risk and underserved patients affected by the increasing health threat posed by climate change-related wildfires."

    "abstract": "Sarcoidosis staging primarily has relied on the Scadding chest radiographic system, although chest CT imaging is finding increased clinical use. Whether standardized chest CT scan assessment provides additional understanding of lung function beyond Scadding stage and demographics is unknown and the focus of this study. We used National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute study Genomics Research in Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency and Sarcoidosis (GRADS) cases of sarcoidosis (n = 351) with Scadding stage and chest CT scans obtained in a standardized manner. One chest radiologist scored all CT scans with a visual scoring system, with a subset read by another chest radiologist. We compared demographic features, Scadding stage and CT scan findings, and the correlation between these measures. Associations between spirometry and diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (Dlco) results and CT scan findings and Scadding stage were determined using regression analysis (n = 318). Agreement between readers was evaluated using Cohen's κ value. CT scan features were inconsistent with Scadding stage in approximately 40% of cases. Most CT scan features assessed on visual scoring were associated negatively with lung function. Associations persisted for FEV<sub>1</sub> and Dlco when adjusting for Scadding stage, although some CT scan feature associations with FVC became insignificant. Scadding stage was associated primarily with FEV<sub>1</sub>, and inclusion of CT scan features reduced significance in association between Scadding stage and lung function. Multivariable regression modeling to identify radiologic measures explaining lung function included Scadding stage for FEV<sub>1</sub> and FEV<sub>1</sub> to FVC ratio (P < .05) and marginally for Dlco (P < .15). Combinations of CT scan measures accounted for Scadding stage for FVC. Correlations among Scadding stage and CT scan features were noted. Agreement between readers was poor to moderate for presence or absence of CT scan features and poor for degree and location of abnormality. In this study, CT scan features explained additional variability in lung function beyond Scadding stage, with some CT scan features obviating the associations between lung function and Scadding stage. Whether CT scan features, phenotypes, or endotypes could be useful for treating patients with sarcoidosis needs more study."

The standard of care, plasma-derived AAT (pdAAT), is delivered as weekly infusions to maintain serum AAT concentrations ≥11µM (≈50% of those in healthy individuals). INBRX-101, a recombinant human AAT-Fc fusion protein, was designed to have a longer half-life and achieve higher AAT levels than pdAAT. In this phase 1 dose-escalation study (N=31), adults with AATD received 1 dose (part 1) or 3 doses (part 2) of 10 (part 1), 40, 80, or 120mg/kg INBRX-101 every 3 weeks (Q3W) via intravenous infusion. The primary endpoint was safety and tolerability. Secondary endpoints were pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and immunogenicity of INBRX-101. INBRX-101 was well tolerated. Most treatment-emergent adverse events were grade ≤2. In part 2 (n=18; each dose, n=6), dose-related increases in serum functional AAT (fAAT) were observed; mean fAAT levels remained above the 21 µM target for up to 4 weeks after the final dose in the 120-mg/kg cohort. Antidrug antibodies had no meaningful impact on PK or PD. INBRX-101 was detected in pulmonary epithelial lining fluid (PELF) from all patients assessed (n=11), and PELF fAAT increased after dosing. PK/PD modeling projected steady-state serum fAAT ≥21µM at 120 mg/kg Q3W (average concentration ≈43µM; trough concentration ≈28µM) and Q4W (≈34µM; ≈21µM). The favorable safety profile and ability to maintain serum fAAT levels >21µM with extended-interval dosing, support a phase 2 trial evaluating Q3W and Q4W dosing of INBRX-101."

KF4 anti-CELA1 antibody prevented emphysema in PPE and cigarette smoke models in wild type mice. We evaluated potential toxicities of KF4 and its ability to prevent emphysema in AAT deficiency. We found Cela1 protein expression in mouse lung, pancreas, small intestine, and spleen. In toxicity studies, mice treated with KF4 25 mg/kg weekly for four weeks showed an elevation in blood urea nitrogen and slower weight gain compared to lower doses or equivalent dose IgG. In histologic grading of tissue injury of the lung, kidney, liver, and heart, there was some evidence of liver injury with KF4 25 mg/kg, but in all tissues, injury was less than in control mice subjected to cecal ligation and puncture. In efficacy studies, KF4 doses as low as 0.5 mg/kg reduced the lung elastase activity of <i>AAT</i><sup><i>-/-</i></sup> mice treated with 0.2 units of PPE. In this injury model, <i>AAT</i><sup><i>-/-</i></sup> mice treated with KF4 1 mg/kg weekly, human purified AAT 60 mg/kg weekly, and combined KF4 and AAT treatment had less emphysema than mice treated with IgG 1 mg/kg weekly. However, the efficacy of KF4, AAT, or KF4 & AAT was similar. While KF4 might be an alternative to AAT replacement, combined KF4 and AAT replacement does not confer additional benefit."

A clear discrimination of mutant and wild-type variants was achieved in the genetic loci that define PI*S and PI*Z alleles. Specific amplicons showed a difference of 2.0 °C in melting temperature for non-S and S variants and of 2.9 °C for non-Z and Z variants.

    "title": "European pathways of care in Alpha-1 Antitrypsin deficiency.",
    "abstract": "Despite initiatives to improve awareness and treatment of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD), country-level processes for AATD management remain unclear. We conducted a pan-European physician survey to clarify the pathways for AATD care. Professionals involved in AATD diagnosis and/or management completed a web-based survey on the detection, evaluation, monitoring and treatment of AATD and the utilisation of European reference network centres for rare lung diseases (ERN-LUNG). Surveys were completed by 166 physicians from 18 European countries. Overall, 25 % of respondents were unaware of local specific AATD testing guidelines, and most (72 %) had referred <10 patients to a specialist. However, there was general agreement regarding reasons for referral and the types of patient referred. Approaches to AATD testing are heterogenous, with significant between-country differences in the sample testing and collection methods used. Alpha-1 antitrypsin therapy is most frequently monitored using spirometry (98 %), gas transfer (79 %) or symptoms (82 %). Overall, 28 % of respondents were unfamiliar with ERN-LUNG centres, with Portugal and Spain reporting the lowest familiarity, and use of these centres for patient evaluation varied widely. However, engagement with ERN-LUNG centres was widely agreed to be useful when it did occur (especially in Italy and Poland). Little cross-border use of ERN-LUNG centres for patient testing/evaluation was reported. European care pathways for AATD are largely uniform, but with notable heterogeneity in testing approaches and a need for education and standardisation. Familiarity with and use of ERN-LUNG AATD services is variable, and increased awareness of these services is warranted."

    "abstract": "Most tympanic membrane (TM) perforations heal spontaneously, but 10%-20% remain chronic and might lead to impaired hearing and recurrent middle ear infections. Alpha1-antitrypsin (AAT) is a circulating tissue-protective protein that is elevated under inflammatory conditions and is currently indicated for genetic AAT deficiency. Recently, AAT has been shown to promote tissue remodeling and inflammatory resolution. This study aimed to examine the effects of local clinical-grade AAT treatment on tissue repair in a mouse model of acute traumatic TM perforation. Wild-type mice underwent unilateral TM perforation and were either left untreated or treated locally with human AAT (9 × 10<sup>-3</sup> mL at 20 mg/mL on days 0, 1, and 2; n = 15/group). The perforations were evaluated macroscopically on a serial basis. Mice were sacrificed on various days post-injury, and TMs were excised for gene analysis by RT-PCR. There were no adverse reactions in hAAT-treated ears throughout the study period. Compared with untreated animals, TM closure occurred earlier in the treated group (days until full closure, median: 4 and 9, respectively). According to gene expression analysis, VEGF, TGFβ, and collagen-5A1 were induced earlier in AAT-treated mice (day 4-5 compared with day 9). Additionally, IL-10 expression levels were higher and IL-6 levels were lower in treated versus untreated mice. A local tissue environment rich in AAT promotes early tissue repair in a perforated TM model both macroscopically and molecularly. Studies are underway to examine TM functionality and recombinant AAT formulations for micro-dosing in the format of a single local application. NA Laryngoscope, 134:3802-3806, 2024."

    "abstract": "Genetic variation in human populations can result in the misfolding and aggregation of proteins, giving rise to systemic and neurodegenerative diseases that require management by proteostasis. Here, we define the role of GRP94, the endoplasmic reticulum Hsp90 chaperone paralog, in managing alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency on a residue-by-residue basis using Gaussian process regression-based machine learning to profile the spatial covariance relationships that dictate protein folding arising from sequence variants in the population. Covariance analysis suggests a role for the ATPase activity of GRP94 in controlling the N- to C-terminal cooperative folding of alpha-1-antitrypsin responsible for the correction of liver aggregation and lung-disease phenotypes of alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency. Gaussian process-based spatial covariance profiling provides a standard model built on covariant principles to evaluate the role of proteostasis components in guiding information flow from genome to proteome in response to genetic variation, potentially allowing us to intervene in the onset and progression of complex multi-system human diseases."

    "abstract": "Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency, an autosomal co-dominant inherited condition, significantly impacts lung and liver functions, with mutations in the SERPINA1 gene, notably the Z allele, playing a pivotal role in disease susceptibility. This retrospective descriptive study from a rural Eastern Kentucky pulmonary clinic aimed to characterize patients with AAT deficiency, focusing on demographic, clinical, and laboratory parameters extracted from electronic health records (EHR) of Appalachian Regional Healthcare (ARH). Among 100 patient encounters, 56 were analyzed, revealing notable sex-based differences in smoking rates and co-existing conditions, with males showing higher rates of black lung and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In comparison, females exhibited higher rates of asthma, COVID-19, pneumothorax, and obstructive sleep apnea. The study emphasizes the importance of understanding genotype-phenotype correlations and demographic factors in assessing AAT deficiency, advocating for further research to refine management strategies and elucidate causal relationships."

    "abstract": "Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) assessments such as St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) are often used as outcome measures to evaluate patient-perceived changes in health status among individuals with lung disease. Several factors have been linked to deterioration in SGRQ, including symptoms (dyspnea, wheezing) and exercise intolerance. Whether these findings apply to individuals with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) remains incompletely studied. This longitudinal study examines the trajectory of SGRQ scores in a cohort of United States individuals with AATD-associated lung disease and defines factors associated with longitudinal change. Individuals with AATD-associated lung disease enrolled in AlphaNet, a disease management program, who had ≥3 SGRQ measurements collected between 2009 and 2019, and baseline data for clinically important variables were included in these analyses. Data collected after lung transplants were excluded. Mixed-effects model analyses were used to evaluate the changes in SGRQ total and subscale scores over time and by modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) Scale, use of oxygen, age, sex, productive cough, and exacerbation frequency at baseline. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to examine the potential effect of survivor bias. Participants (n=2456, mean age 57.1±9.9 years, 47% female) had a mean SGRQ total score of 44.7±18.9 at baseline, 48% used oxygen regularly, and 55% had ≥2 exacerbations per year. The median length of follow-up was 6 (IQR 3-9) years. The SGRQ total score and subscales remained stable throughout the observation period. Age, mMRC categories, presence or absence of productive cough, frequency of exacerbations, and use of oxygen at baseline were significantly associated with the rate of change of SGRQ total (p<0.0001). We observed long-term stability in HRQoL and an association between the rate of change in SGRQ and baseline mMRC, exacerbation frequency, productive cough, and use of oxygen in this cohort of individuals with AATD-associated lung disease."

    "title": "Pulmonary manifestations of alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency.",
    "abstract": "Alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency is a widely under recognized autosomal codominant condition caused by genetic mutations in the SERPINA 1 gene, which encodes for alpha 1 antitrypsin (AAT), a serine protease inhibitor. The SERPINA 1 gene contains 120 variants and mutations in the gene may decrease AAT protein levels or result in dysfunctional proteins. This deficiency leads to unopposed protease activity in tissues, thereby promoting pulmonary and hepatic disease. The most common genotype associated with pulmonary disease is the ZZ genotype, and the most frequent pulmonary manifestation is emphysema. Although its pathophysiology may differ from cigarette smoking related chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, smoking itself can hasten lung decline in alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD). The diagnosis of AATD is made through AAT protein testing along with genotyping. AATD patients with obstructive airflow limitation may qualify for intravenous augmentation with AAT. However, there is ongoing research to allow for earlier detection and treatment. This review describes in general terms the genetic mechanisms of AATD; its pathogenesis and the impact of cigarette smoke; and its clinical manifestations, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis. We hope to stimulate research in the field, but mostly we wish to enhance awareness to promote early diagnosis and treatment in those eligible for intervention."

    "abstract": "The prevalence of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) in Macaronesia (i.e., Azores, Madeira, Canary Islands, and Cape Verde archipelagos) is poorly known. Our goal was to update it by selecting the most reliable available articles. Literature search using MEDLINE, Embase (via Ovid), and Google Scholar, until December 2023, for studies on prevalence of AATD in the general population and in screenings, published in peer-reviewed journals. Three studies carried out in the general population of Madeira, La Palma, and Cape Verde, and three screenings carried out in La Palma (2) and Gran Canaria (1) were selected. The frequencies of PI*S in the general population showed an ascending gradient, from South to North, with values (per thousand) of 35 in Cape Verde, 82 in La Palma, and 180 in Madeira. The PI*Z frequencies showed this same gradient, with values of 2 × 1,000 in Cape Verde, 21 in La Palma, and 25 in Madeira. Screenings detected high percentages of defective alleles, including several rare and null alleles, some unique to these islands. The frequencies of PI*S and PI*Z in Madeira are comparable to the highest in the world. Those of the Canary Islands are similar to those of the peninsular population of Spain, and contrast with the low rates of Cape Verde. Screenings detected high numbers of deficient alleles. These results support the systematic investigation of AATD in clinically suspected patients and in relatives of index cases, to reduce underdiagnosis and apply early preventive and therapeutic measures in those affected."

    "abstract": "Alpha-1-antitrypsin (A1AT) is a multifunctional, clinically important, high value therapeutic glycoprotein that can be used for the treatment of many diseases such as alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, diabetes, graft-versus-host-disease, cystic fibrosis and various viral infections. Currently, the only FDA-approved treatment for A1AT disorders is intravenous augmentation therapy with human plasma-derived A1AT. In addition to its limited supply, this approach poses a risk of infection transmission, since it uses therapeutic A1AT harvested from donors. To address these issues, we sought to generate recombinant human A1AT (rhA1AT) that is chemically and biologically indistinguishable from its plasma-derived counterpart using glycoengineered Chinese Hamster Ovary (geCHO-L) cells. By deleting nine key genes that are part of the CHO glycosylation machinery and expressing the human ST6GAL1 and A1AT genes, we obtained stable, high producing geCHO-L lines that produced rhA1AT having an identical glycoprofile to plasma-derived A1AT (pdA1AT). Additionally, the rhA1AT demonstrated <i>in vitro</i> activity and <i>in vivo</i> half-life comparable to commercial pdA1AT. Thus, we anticipate that this platform will help produce human-like recombinant plasma proteins, thereby providing a more sustainable and reliable source of therapeutics that are cost-effective and better-controlled with regard to purity, clinical safety and quality."

    "abstract": "In the classical form of α1-antitrypsin deficiency, a misfolded variant α1-antitrypsin Z accumulates in the endoplasmic reticulum of liver cells and causes liver cell injury by gain-of-function proteotoxicity in a sub-group of affected homozygotes but relatively little is known about putative modifiers. Here, we carried out genomic sequencing in a uniquely affected family with an index case of liver failure and 2 homozygous siblings with minimal or no liver disease. Their sequences were compared to sequences in well-characterized cohorts of homozygotes with or without liver disease, and then candidate sequence variants were tested for changes in the kinetics of α1-antitrypsin variant Z degradation in iPS-derived hepatocyte-like cells derived from the affected siblings themselves. Specific variants in autophagy genes MTMR12 and FAM134A could each accelerate the degradation of α1-antitrypsin variant Z in cells from the index patient, but both MTMR12 and FAM134A variants were needed to slow the degradation of α1-antitrypsin variant Z in cells from a protected sib, indicating that inheritance of both variants is needed to mediate the pathogenic effects of hepatic proteotoxicity at the cellular level. Analysis of homozygote cohorts showed that multiple patient-specific variants in proteostasis genes are likely to explain liver disease susceptibility at the population level. These results validate the concept that genetic variation in autophagy function can determine susceptibility to liver disease in α1-antitrypsin deficiency and provide evidence that polygenic mechanisms and multiple patient-specific variants are likely needed for proteotoxic pathology."

Whether these guidelines are effectuated in clinical practice is uncertain. To begin to address this issue, we determined whether A1AT phenotyping is performed in patients with serum A1AT 57 - 99 mg/dL at our institution. We reviewed the medical records of patients seen at Jesse Brown Veterans Affairs Medical Center from January 2019 to October 2022 with serum A1AT between 57 and 99 mg/dL. In each case, pertinent demographic, clinical, and pulmonary function tests data were extracted. Data were presented as means and standard deviation (SD) where appropriate. The Student's <i>t</i>-test was used for statistical analysis. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Thirty patients (90% males; 60 ± 18 years) with serum A1ATD < 100 mg/mL were identified. Fourteen were African Americans, four Hispanics, and 12 non-Hispanic Whites. The majority were current or ex-smokers. Fourteen (47%) patients had lung disease, 14 (47%) liver disease and one had concomitant lung and liver diseases. Mean ± SD forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV<sub>1</sub>) and lung diffusing capacity were 2.57 ± 1.41 L (67±19% predicated) and 18.7 ± 10 mL/min/mm Hg (64±28% predicted), respectively. Only 13 patients (43%) underwent phenotype testing (seven African Americans, five Whites, and one Hispanic). Six patients had MZ phenotype, four MS, and three SZ. One patient died from acute respiratory failure during the study period. Phenotyping of patients with serum A1AT 57 - 99 mg/dL at our institution is inadequate. Accordingly, regular continuous medical educational programs on A1AT phenotyping targeting healthcare providers are warranted."

Also, they hold promise for guiding therapeutic interventions and personalized medicine strategies in the future. A comprehensive understanding of the impact of SNVs in the <i>SERPINA1</i> gene on alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) protein structure and function requires integrating bioinformatic approaches. Here, we provide a guide for clinicians to navigate through the field of computational analyses which can be applied to describe a novel genetic variant. Predicting the clinical significance of <i>SERPINA1</i> variation allows clinicians to tailor treatment options for individuals with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) and related conditions, ultimately improving the patient's outcome and quality of life.

This study intended to identify independent predictive factors for exacerbations in AATD using the Portuguese European Alpha-1 Research Collaboration (EARCO) registry. This study includes patients from the Portuguese EARCO registry, a prospective multicenter cohort (NCT04180319). From October 2020 to April 2023, this registry enrolled 137 patients, 14 of whom were excluded for analysis for either missing 12 months of follow-up or baseline pulmonary function. Among the 123 AATD patients, 27 (22.0%) had at least one exacerbation in the last 12 months of follow-up. Patients with Pi*ZZ phenotype were three times more likely than the rest of the population to experience any exacerbation (32.7 vs. 14.1%, p = 0.014; OR 3.0). BODE index was significantly higher in exacerbators than in non-exacerbators (3.9 ± 2.4 vs. 1.3 ± 1.2; p &lt; 0.001), including on multivariate analysis (p = 0.002). Similar results were found for BODEx (multivariate p &lt; 0.001). DLCO was the only functional parameter independently associated with exacerbations (p = 0.024). DLCO, BODE, and BODEx were independent predictors of exacerbations at 12 months in AATD patients.

    "abstract": "Mutants of alpha-1-antitrypsin cause the protein to self-associate and form ordered aggregates ('polymers') that are retained within hepatocytes, resulting in a predisposition to the development of liver disease. The associated reduction in secretion, and for some mutants, impairment of function, leads to a failure to protect lung tissue against proteases released during the inflammatory response and an increased risk of emphysema. We report here a novel deficiency mutation (Gly192Cys), that we name the Sydney variant, identified in a patient in heterozygosity with the Z allele (Glu342Lys). Cellular analysis revealed that the novel variant was mostly retained as insoluble polymers within the endoplasmic reticulum. The basis for this behaviour was investigated using biophysical and structural techniques. The variant showed a 40% reduction in inhibitory activity and a reduced stability as assessed by thermal unfolding experiments. Polymerisation involves adoption of an aggregation-prone intermediate and paradoxically the energy barrier for transition to this state was increased by 16% for the Gly192Cys variant with respect to the wild-type protein. However, with activation to the intermediate state, polymerisation occurred at a 3.8-fold faster rate overall. X-ray crystallography provided two crystal structures of the Gly192Cys variant, revealing perturbation within the 'breach' region with Cys192 in two different orientations: in one structure it faces towards the hydrophobic core while in the second it is solvent-exposed. This orientational heterogeneity was confirmed by PEGylation. These data show the critical role of the torsional freedom imparted by Gly192 in inhibitory activity and stability against polymerisation."

Risk factors for disease progression and specific pathophysiologic features are not well known and validated non-invasive assessments for disease severity are lacking. Currently, there are no approved treatments for AATLD. To outline existing understanding of AATLD and to identify knowledge gaps critical to improving clinical trial design and development of new treatments. This report was developed following a multi-stakeholder forum organised by the Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency Related Liver Disease Expert Panel in which experts presented an overview of the available literature on this topic. AATLD results from a 'gain of toxic function' and primarily manifests in those with the homozygous Pi*ZZ genotype. Accumulation of misfolded 'Z' AAT protein in liver cells triggers intracellular hepatocyte injury which may ultimately lead to hepatic fibrosis. Male gender, age over 50 years, persistently elevated liver tests, concomitant hepatitis B or C virus infection, and metabolic syndrome, including obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus, are known risk factors for adult AATLD. While the gold standard for assessing AATLD disease activity is liver histology, less invasive measures with low intra- and inter-observer variability are needed. Measurement of liver stiffness shows promise; validated thresholds for staging AATLD are in development. Such advances will help patients by enabling risk stratification and personalised surveillance, along with streamlining the development process for novel therapies. This inaugural forum generated a list of recommendations to address unmet needs in the field of AATLD."

    "abstract": "Alpha 1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (AATD) is a rare, inherited lung disease which shares features with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) but has a greater burden of proteinase related tissue damage. These proteinases are associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the general population. It is unclear whether patients with AATD have a greater risk of CVD compared to usual COPD, how best to screen for this, and whether neutrophil proteinases are implicated in AATD-associated CVD. This study had three aims. To compare CVD risk in never-augmented AATD patients to non-AATD COPD and healthy controls (HC). To assess relationships between CVD risk and lung physiology. To determine if neutrophil proteinase activity was associated with CVD risk in AATD. Cardiovascular risk was assessed by QRISK2® score and aortic stiffness measurements using carotid-femoral (aortic) pulse wave velocity (aPWV). Medical history, computed tomography scans and post-bronchodilator lung function parameters were reviewed. Systemic proteinase 3 activity was measured. Patients were followed for 4 years, to assess CVD development. 228 patients with AATD, 50 with non-AATD COPD and 51 healthy controls were recruited. In all COPD and HC participants, QRISK2® and aPWV gave concordant results (with both measures either high or in the normal range). This was not the case in AATD. Once aPWV was adjusted for age and smoking history, aPWV was highest and QRISK2® lowest in AATD patients compared to the COPD or HC participants. Higher aPWV was associated with impairments in lung physiology, the presence of emphysema on CT scan and proteinase 3 activity following adjustment for age, smoking status and traditional CVD risk factors (using QRISK2® scores) in AATD. There were no such relationships with QRISK2® in AATD. AATD patients with confirmed CVD at four-year follow up had a higher aPWV but not QRISK2® at baseline assessment. aPWV measured CVD risk is elevated in AATD. This risk is not captured by QRISK2®. There is a relationship between aPWV, lung disease and proteinase-3 activity. Proteinase-driven breakdown of elastin fibres in large arteries and lungs is a putative mechanism and forms a potential therapeutic target for CVD in AATD."

These tools have an advantage over disease-specific instruments, as they allow comparisons across different health conditions and with the general population. In alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD)-associated chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), HRQoL research remains scarce. This cross-sectional study evaluates the factors associated with HRQoL in a cohort of patients with AATD-associated COPD. Our study included participants of AlphaNet (2008-2019), a health management organization for people with AATD in the US who are prescribed augmentation therapy. Norm-based SF-36 scores for the mental and physical component summary scores (MCS and PCS, mean of 50 ± 10 in the general US population) and 8 individual scales were evaluated. Individuals with lung disease and data available on ≥1 measurement on any SF-36 scale and clinically relevant characteristics such as modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) scale, exacerbation frequency, productive cough, and use of oxygen were included in these analyses. Generalized linear regression models were fit to examine the association of baseline characteristics with MCS and PCS scores. Age, sex, regular use of oxygen, exacerbation frequency, mMRC, and productive cough were included in these models. Participants (n=4398, mean age 57.6 [SD=10.6] years, 45.4% female) had a mean MCS score of 51.2 ± 10.8 and PCS of 36.3 ± 9.8. The average mMRC score was 2.4 ± 1.3, and 56.4% had 2 or more exacerbations per year. Overall, the physical component of SF-36 was more severely impacted compared to the mental component. In multivariable regression analyses, PCS scores were significantly associated with exacerbation frequency, mMRC, regular use of oxygen, and productive cough; MCS was associated with age, sex, exacerbation frequency, mMRC, and productive cough. These findings demonstrate that patient-perceived physical health is significantly impaired in this cohort of people with AATD-associated COPD compared to mental health. Longitudinal studies are needed to evaluate the change in physical and mental health status over time in this population."

Genotyping formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue is a novel approach that could aid in detecting variant A1AT. We performed qPCR on FFPE liver explants with Periodic Acid Schiff after Diastase (PASD)- and A1AT-positive globules to confirm and estimate the frequency of A1AT deficiency in transplant cases. Eighteen (12.68%) of 142 patients with end-stage liver disease showed PASD/A1AT positive globules. FFPE of the explants was tested through qPCR to detect S and Z alleles. A second age- and sex-matched control group consisting of five liver transplant patients with negative globules was included in the study. qPCR assay was successful with all the samples meeting QC parameters. All patients included in the study elucidated Z allele variants; 2 homozygous (11.1%) and 16 heterozygous (88.9%). The control group demonstrated normal wild-type MM allele. Screening for A1AT deficiency using serum levels is not sufficiently sensitive to detect deficiency, especially in carriers. If A1AT testing was not performed preoperatively and the risk is high based on the PASD/A1AT-positive globules in the explants, then molecular testing of FFPE tissue can be a viable method for confirming the diagnosis."

These findings increased our understanding for potential biomarkers in hepatocellular carcinoma and an experimental approach will further enhance our outcomes in future."

    "abstract": "Different studies have shown that carrying an alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency allele is an independent risk factor for developing lung cancer (LC). However, to date, little is known regarding whether carrying a deficiency allele may be a prognostic factor in the evolution of LC. A prospective observational study was carried out which consecutively included patients diagnosed with LC in University Hospital \"Nuestra Señora de Candelaria\" between December 2017 and August 2020. A blood sample was taken from each of the patients in order to determine both AAT serum concentration and genotype. Based on AAT genotype, patients were divided into the deficiency (<i>Pi*</i>≠<i>MM</i>) or non-deficiency (<i>Pi*=MM</i>) group. One hundred and sixty-four patients were included. The average length of follow-up was 13±10 months. Patients were classified as stage I (4.2%), stage II (8.3%), stage III (31.2%) and stage IV (56.3%), according to tumour, node and metastasis (TNM) staging. Twenty-eight patients (17%) were carriers of a deficiency allele (6 <i>Pi*MS</i>, 1 <i>Pi*MZ</i>, 1 <i>Pi*MM<sub>heerlen</sub></i>). No significant differences were found with respect to baseline characteristics between <i>Pi*</i>≠<i>MM</i> and <i>Pi*=MM.</i> Patients in the <i>Pi*</i>≠<i>MM</i> group had a higher risk of death in the first 6 months after the LC diagnosis compared to <i>Pi*=MM</i> subjects (HR =2.04; 95% CI: 1.04-4.0; P=0.038). The presence of an AAT deficiency genotype could be a potential prognostic marker in LC. However, larger studies that justify these findings are needed."

    "abstract": "Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is characterized by both chronic lung disease due to loss of wild-type AAT (M-AAT) antiprotease function and liver disease due to toxicity from delayed secretion, polymerization, and aggregation of misfolded mutant AAT (Z-AAT). The ideal gene therapy for AATD should therefore comprise both endogenous Z-AAT suppression and M-AAT overexpression. We designed a dual-function rAAV3B (df-rAAV3B) construct, which was effective at transducing hepatocytes, resulting in a considerable decrease of Z-AAT levels and safe M-AAT augmentation in mice. We optimized df-rAAV3B and created two variants, AAV3B-E12 and AAV3B-G3, to simultaneously enhance the concentration of M-AAT in the bloodstream to therapeutic levels and silence endogenous AAT liver expression in cynomolgus monkeys. Our results demonstrate that AAV3b-WT, AAV3B-E12, and AAV3B-G3 were able to transduce the monkey livers and achieve high M-AAT serum levels efficiently and safely. In this nondeficient model, we did not find downregulation of endogenous AAT. However, the dual-function vector did serve as a potentially \"liver-sparing\" alternative for high-dose liver-mediated AAT gene replacement in the context of underlying liver disease."

We aimed to investigate putative differences in plasma levels of acute phase proteins (APP) between PiMM and PiZZ subjects and to determine plasma Z-AAT polymer levels in PiZZ subjects. Nephelometric analysis of seven plasma APPs was performed in 67 PiMM and 44 PiZZ subjects, of whom 43 and 42, respectively, had stable COPD. Of the PiZZ-COPD patients, 21 received and 23 did not receive intravenous therapy with human AAT preparations (IV-AAT). Plasma levels of Z-AAT polymers were determined by Western blotting using specific mouse monoclonal antibodies (2C1 and LG96). In addition to lower plasma AAT, PiZZ patients had higher α2-macroglobulin (A2MG) levels than PiMM patients. In contrast, PiZZ who received IV-AAT had higher AAT values but lower A2MG values than PiZZ without IV-AAT. Regardless of the AAT genotype, AAT levels were inversely correlated with A2MG, and the AAT/A2MG ratio was correlated with lung diffusion capacity (DCLO%). All PiZZ patients had circulating Z-AAT polymer levels that correlated directly with A2MG. In PiZZ without IV-AAT therapy polymer levels correlated inversely with the ratio of forced expiratory volume in 1 s to forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC). Combined measurement of plasma AAT and A2MG levels may be of clinical value in assessing the progression of COPD and requires further attention."

To understand the potential impact on course of inflammation, the aim of this study was to investigate whether C3d, a cleavage-product of C3, triggers interleukin (IL)-1β secretion via activation of NOD-, LRR- and pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome. The objective was to explore the effect of AAT augmentation therapy in patients with AATD on the C3d/complement receptor 3 (CR3) signalling axis of monocytes and on circulating pro-inflammatory markers. Inflammatory mediators were detected in blood from patients with AATD (n=28) and patients with AATD receiving augmentation therapy (n=19). Inflammasome activation and IL-1β secretion were measured in monocytes of patients with AATD, and following C3d stimulation in the presence or absence of CR3 or NLRP3 inhibitors. C3d acting via CR3 induces NLRP3 and pro-IL-1β production, and through induction of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and calcium flux, triggers caspase-1 activation and IL-1β secretion. Treatment of individuals with AATD with AAT therapy results in decreased plasma levels of C3d (3.0±1.2 µg/mL vs 1.3±0.5 µg/mL respectively, p<0.0001) and IL-1β (115.4±30 pg/mL vs 73.3±20 pg/mL, respectively, p<0.0001), with a 2.0-fold decrease in monocyte NLRP3 protein expression (p=0.0303), despite continued ER stress activation. These results provide strong insight into the mechanism of complement-driven inflammation associated with AATD. Although the described variance in C3d and NLRP3 activation decreased post AAT augmentation therapy, results demonstrate persistent C3d and monocyte ER stress, with implications for new therapeutics and clinical practice."

Reduced AAT levels are associated with elevated risk of developing emphysema mainly due to uncontrolled activity of neutrophil elastase in the lungs. The prevalent Z-AAT mutant and many rare pathogenic AAT variants also predispose to liver disease due to their accumulation as polymeric chains in hepatocytes. Part of these polymers are secreted into the bloodstream and could represent biomarkers of intra-hepatic accumulation. Moreover, being inactive, they further lower lung protection against proteases. Aim of our study is to accurately quantify the percentage of circulating polymers (CP) in a cohort of subjects with different <i>SERPINA1</i> genotypes. CP concentration was measured in plasma or Dried Blood Spot (DBS) by a sensitive sandwich ELISA based on capture by the polymer-specific 2C1 monoclonal antibody. CP were significantly elevated in patients with the prevalent PI*SZ and PI*ZZ genotypes, with considerable intra-genotype variability. Notably, higher percentage of polymers was observed in association with elevated C-reactive protein. CP levels were also increased in carriers of the M<sub>malton</sub> variant, and of M<sub>procida</sub>, I, P<sub>lowell</sub> and M<sub>herleen</sub> in heterozygosity with Z-AAT. These findings highlight the importance of implementing CP quantification in a clinical laboratory. Indeed, the variable amount of CP in patients with the same genotype may correlate with the variable severity of the associated lung and liver diseases. Moreover, CP can reveal the polymerogenic potential of newly discovered ultrarare AAT variants."

The aim was to evaluate the frequency of performing AAT levels and associated factors in COPD patients in an audit conducted in 2021-2022, as well as to compare with a previous audit conducted in 2014-2015. EPOCONSUL 2021 is a cross-sectional audit that evaluated the outpatient care provided to COPD patients in respiratory clinics in Spain based on available data from medical registries. 4225 patients with a diagnosis of COPD from 45 centers were audited in 2021. A total of 1670 (39.5%) patients underwent AAT determination. Being treated at a specialized COPD outpatient clinic (OR 1.88, <i>p</i> = 0.007), age ≤ 55 years old (OR 1.84, <i>p</i> = 0.007) and a FEV1 < 50% (OR 1.86, <i>p</i> < 0.001) were associated with a higher likelihood of being tested for AAT, while Charlson index ≥ 3 (OR 0.63, <i>p</i> < 0.001) and genotyping of AATD availability (OR 0.42, <i>p</i> < 0.001) showed a statistically significant negative association. The analysis of cases included in respiratory units that participated in both audits showed an increase in the proportion of cases with AAT serum level testing available (adjusted OR 2.81, <i>p</i> < 0.001). The percentage of individuals with serum AAT levels < 60 mg/dL (a severe AATD) was 4%. Our analysis identifies significant improvements in adherence to the recommendation to test AAT levels in COPD patients, performed in 4 out of 10 patients, being more likely at younger ages and with higher COPD severity, and with a detection of severe AATD of 4% among those tested, suggesting that clinicians still perform AAT testing in COPD patients selectively. Therefore, efforts are still needed to optimize AATD screening and establish new early detection strategies to reduce morbidity and mortality in these patients."

Here, we review the current literature on AATD and allele frequency primarily in Black populations and discuss the possible clinical outcomes of low screening rates in a population that experiences poor health outcomes and whether the low frequency of AATD is related to a lack of screening in this population or a truly low frequency of mutations causing AATD.

    "abstract": "Alpha 1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (AATD) is a largely underrecognized genetic condition characterized by low Alpha 1 Antitrypsin (AAT) serum levels, resulting from variations in SERPINA1. Many individuals affected by AATD are thought to be undiagnosed, leading to poor patient outcomes. The Z (c.1096G > A; p.Glu366Lys) and S (c.863A > T; p.Glu288Val) deficiency variants are the most frequently found variants in AATD, with the Z variant present in most individuals diagnosed with AATD. However, there are many other less frequent variants known to contribute to lung and/or liver disease in AATD. To identify the most common rare variants associated with AATD, we conducted a systematic literature review with the aim of assessing AATD variation patterns across the world. A systematic literature search was performed to identify published studies reporting AATD/SERPINA1 variants. Study eligibility was assessed for the potential to contain relevant information, with quality assessment and data extraction performed on studies meeting all eligibility criteria. AATD variants were grouped by variant type and linked to the geographical region identified from the reporting article. Of the 4945 articles identified by the search string, 864 contained useful information for this study. Most articles came from the United States, followed by the United Kingdom, Germany, Spain, and Italy. Collectively, the articles identified a total of 7631 rare variants and 216 types of rare variant across 80 counties. The F (c.739C > T; p.Arg247Cys) variant was identified 1,281 times and was the most reported known rare variant worldwide, followed by the I (c.187C > T; p.Arg63Cys) variant. Worldwide, there were 1492 Null/rare variants that were unidentified at the time of source article publication and 75 rare novel variants reported only once. AATD goes far beyond the Z and S variants, suggesting there may be widespread underdiagnosis of patients with the condition. Each geographical region has its own distinctive variety of AATD variants and, therefore, comprehensive testing is needed to fully understand the true number and type of variants that exist. Comprehensive testing is also needed to ensure accurate diagnosis, optimize treatment strategies, and improve outcomes for patients with AATD."

Computed tomography revealed centriacinar and panacinar emphysema with prominent air entrapment, atelectasis, and localized bronchiectasis. Serum AAT was < 0.27 g/L (below detection limit). Genetic analysis showed homozygous deletion of exons I to III.

STUB1 is an important E3 ubiquitin ligase that regulates ubiquitination modification of various proteins. However, whether STUB1 in involved in the ubiquitination modification of ATZ has not been fully elucidated. In this study, the ATZ and STUB1 coding genes were first cloned into the pET28a plasmid, constructing 2 protein expression plasmids. The recombinant plasmids were then transferred into the <i>Escherichia coli</i> for expression. With the optimization of induction temperature and IPTG dosage, the recombinant proteins were successfully expressed. The target proteins were then efficiently purified from cell lysates using metal-chelating affinity chromatography, and the accuracy of the amino acid sequence was verified through protein mass spectrometry analysis. Using the purified ATZ and STUB1, we established an <i>in vitro</i> ubiquitination reaction system. Experimental results showed that, in the presence of ATP, E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme, and E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, STUB1 catalyzed the ubiquitination modification of ATZ.

    "abstract": "In the classic form of α1-antitrypsin deficiency (ATD), the misfolded α1-antitrypsin Z (ATZ) variant accumulates in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of liver cells. A gain-of-function proteotoxic mechanism is responsible for chronic liver disease in a subgroup of homozygotes. Proteostatic response pathways, including conventional endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation and autophagy, have been proposed as the mechanisms that allow cellular adaptation and presumably protection from the liver disease phenotype. Recent studies have concluded that a distinct lysosomal pathway called endoplasmic reticulum-to-lysosome completely supplants the role of the conventional macroautophagy pathway in degradation of ATZ. Here, we used several state-of-the-art approaches to characterize the proteostatic responses more fully in cellular systems that model ATD. We used clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-mediated genome editing coupled to a cell selection step by fluorescence-activated cell sorter to perform screening for proteostasis genes that regulate ATZ accumulation and combined that with selective genome editing in 2 other model systems. Endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation genes are key early regulators and multiple autophagy genes, from classic as well as from ER-to-lysosome and other newly described ER-phagy pathways, participate in degradation of ATZ in a manner that is temporally regulated and evolves as ATZ accumulation persists. Time-dependent changes in gene expression are accompanied by specific ultrastructural changes including dilation of the ER, formation of globular inclusions, budding of autophagic vesicles, and alterations in the overall shape and component parts of mitochondria. Macroautophagy is a critical component of the proteostasis response to cellular ATZ accumulation and it becomes more important over time as ATZ synthesis continues unabated. Multiple subtypes of macroautophagy and nonautophagic lysosomal degradative pathways are needed to respond to the high concentrations of misfolded protein that characterizes ATD and these pathways are attractive candidates for genetic variants that predispose to the hepatic phenotype."

The aim of this study was to analyze the prevalence of the different AAT gene variants that do not cause severe deficiency in patients with pulmonary emphysema diagnosed by thoracic computed tomography (CT). Furthermore, we assessed the risk associated with a non-severe decrease in AAT values in the pathogenesis of emphysema. Case-control study design that included patients who had a CT scan available of the entire thorax. In total, 176 patients with emphysema (cases) and 100 control subjects without emphysema were analyzed. The prevalence of variants was higher among cases (25.6%; 45/176) than controls (22%; 22/100), although the difference was not statistically significant (P=0.504) when analyzed globally. In the control group, all the variants detected were MS. Excluding this variant, statistically significant differences were observed in the remaining variants (MZ, SS and SZ). Only 18% of the controls (all MS) presented values below our limit of normality, and all had values very close to the reference value (90 mg/dL). In contrast, 76% of patients with the other variants presented pathological levels. In a logistic regression model, both smoking and a non-severe reduction in AAT (60 to 90 mg/dL) increased the probability of emphysema. Our study confirms an association between certain variants in the alpha-1 antitrypsin gene that do not cause severe deficiency and the presence of pulmonary emphysema. This association with variants that are associated with reductions in serum AAT values is statistically significant and independent of smoking habit."

Separating the early stages of an exacerbation from the day-to-day variation in stable COPD is central to the concerns of both clinicians and patients and has been identified as a research priority by NIHR. Clinical tools that distinguish baseline symptoms from those of an exacerbation could allow early and appropriate treatment of AECOPD to reduce the impact and potentially may slow disease progression thereby improving survival and quality of life. Candidate tools include symptom diaries and biomarkers of infection and acute inflammation. Urinary biomarkers of AECOPD have yet to be explored in AATD related COPD. 55 patients with AATD related lung disease with a history of 2 or more AECOPD in the preceding year were prospectively followed for 18 months. Each patient recorded symptom scores daily via an electronic symptom diary (eDiary) based on Bronkotest. Urinary biomarkers for AAT, NE, CRP, TIMP1 and desmosine were measured weekly using a home urinary lateral flow device. During self-reported AECOPD patients were asked to perform urine analysis on the first 7 consecutive days. Type I Anthonisen exacerbations and episodes occurring in autumn/winter lasted longer than Type II/III exacerbations and spring/summer episodes respectively. Median urinary CRP concentration across all study participants increased during Type I AECOPD. eDiary adherence was 68% over a median of 17.8 months (IQR 15.7 to 18.5).

    "abstract": "Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a genetic disease caused by misfolding and accumulation of mutant alpha-1 antitrypsin (ZAAT) in the endoplasmic reticulum of hepatocytes. Hepatic ZAAT aggregates acquire a toxic gain-of-function that impacts the endoplasmic reticulum which is theorized to cause liver disease in individuals with AATD who present asymptomatic until late-stage cirrhosis. Currently, there is no treatment for AATD-mediated liver disease except liver transplantation. In our study of mitochondrial RNA, we identified that Sirtuin3 (SIRT3) plays a role in the hepatic phenotype of AATD. Utilizing RNA and protein analysis in an in vitro AATD model, we investigated the role of SIRT3 in the pathophysiology of AATD-mediated liver disease while also characterizing our novel, transgenic AATD mouse model. We show lower expression of SIRT3 in ZAAT-expressing hepatocytes. In contrast, the overexpression of SIRT3 increases hepatic ZAAT degradation. ZAAT degradation mediated by SIRT3 appeared independent of proteasomal degradation and regular autophagy pathways. We observed that ZAAT-expressing hepatocytes have aberrant accumulation of lipid droplets, with ZAAT polymers localizing on the lipid droplet surface in a direct interaction with Perilipin2, which coats intracellular lipid droplets. SIRT3 overexpression also induced the degradation of lipid droplets in ZAAT-expressing hepatocytes. We observed that SIRT3 overexpression induces lipophagy by enhancing the interaction of Perilipin2 with HSC70. ZAAT polymers then degrade as a consequence of the mobilization of lipids through this process. In this context, SIRT3 activation may eliminate the hepatic toxic gain-of-function associated with the polymerization of ZAAT, providing a rationale for a potential novel therapeutic approach to the treatment of AATD-mediated liver disease."

It is a progressive and irreversible condition that involves pulmonary parenchymal destruction and alveolar dilation. It is commonly associated with middle-aged tobacco smokers, habitual marijuana users, and those with alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency. This case involves an incarcerated male in his 30s with chronic marijuana smoking who presented with a three-month history of right-sided chest pain accompanied by cough, hemoptysis, fever, and weight loss. The patient reported month-long atypical chest discomfort associated with a cough productive of bloody sputum and was brought to the ED after developing acutely worsening right-sided chest pain. The patient underwent a chest X-ray that revealed a large pneumothorax on the left. Subsequently, CT chest imaging showed extensive bilateral bullous disease, left upper lobe consolidation, and enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes. This case illustrates a rare presentation of VLS in the setting of a young patient who other than reported regular marijuana use had no other risk factors and a negative workup for possible etiologies that could cause his severe bullous emphysema, including alpha-1 antitrypsin, HIV, Sjogren's syndrome, pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis, two sputum Mycobacterium tuberculosis tests, and acid-fast bacteria sputum cultures, which were all negative. Identifying and assessing the degree of disease early in this progressive disease helps guide treatment while preventing further deterioration of lung parenchyma."

    "title": "Prevalence of Cardiovascular Disease and Rate of Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events in Severe Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency COPD.",
    "abstract": "Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is an autosomal co-dominant condition that predisposes individuals to early-onset emphysema. As with COPD, AATD-COPD is associated with pulmonary exacerbations, which impacts on overall mortality and quality of life. Though there is evidence that COPD is associated with a higher prevalence of cardiovascular disease and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), it is unclear if this is true for patients with AATD-COPD. Prevalence of cardiovascular disease was determined in two separate severe AATD cohorts: AlphaNet, USA and the Birmingham AATD registry, UK. All patients had preexisting lung disease. Cardiovascular disease was defined as presence of any of the following: heart failure, ischaemic heart disease, atrial fibrillation, stroke, and myocardial infarction. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to assess the impact of prior cardiovascular disease and frequent exacerbator phenotype on risk of future MACE. Out of 3493 patients with severe AATD, 14.7% had prior cardiovascular disease, including stroke (2.3%), myocardial infarction (2.2%), and heart failure (2.5%). Frequent exacerbators were more likely to have preexisting cardiovascular disease compared with those with one or no exacerbations in the preceding year (63% vs 44.8%, <i>p</i> = 0.001). There was increased risk of future MACE in frequent exacerbators (HR 1.85, 95% CI 1.24 to 2.75), former and current smokers (HR 1.80, 95% CI 1.07 to 3.02, <i>p</i> = 0.026, and HR 4.04, 95% CI 1.44 to 11.32, <i>p</i> = 0.008, respectively), and those with prior cardiovascular disease (HR 3.81, 95% CI 2.60 to 5.58, <i>p</i> < 0.001). In severe AATD-COPD, MACE are associated with an increased exacerbation frequency, previous cardiovascular disease, and a history of smoking."

    "abstract": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is an inflammatory multisystemic disease caused by environmental exposures and/or genetic factors. Inherited alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is one of the best recognized genetic factors increasing the risk for an early onset COPD with emphysema. The aim of this study was to gain a better understanding of the associations between comorbidities and specific biomarkers in COPD patients with and without AATD to enable future investigations aimed, for example, at identifying risk factors or improving care. We focused on cardiovascular comorbidities, blood high sensitivity troponin (hs-troponin) and lipid profiles in COPD patients with and without AATD. We used clinical data from six German University Medical Centres of the MIRACUM (Medical Informatics Initiative in Research and Medicine) consortium. The codes for the international classification of diseases (ICD) were used for COPD as a main diagnosis and for comorbidities and blood laboratory data were obtained. Data analyses were based on the DataSHIELD framework. Out of 112,852 visits complete information was available for 43,057 COPD patients. According to our findings, 746 patients with AATD (1.73%) showed significantly lower total blood cholesterol levels and less cardiovascular comorbidities than non-AATD COPD patients. Moreover, after adjusting for the confounder factors, such as age, gender, and nicotine abuse, we confirmed that hs-troponin is a suitable predictor of overall mortality in COPD patients. The comorbidities associated with AATD in the current study differ from other studies, which may reflect geographic and population-based differences as well as the heterogeneous characteristics of AATD. The concept of MIRACUM is suitable for the analysis of a large healthcare database. This study provided evidence that COPD patients with AATD have a lower cardiovascular risk and revealed that hs-troponin is a predictor for hospital mortality in individuals with COPD."

Provider awareness about AATD, concerns with testing costs, and limited understanding about therapeutic options contribute to its underdiagnosis. We hypothesized that provider education would improve awareness of AATD and improve screening. To evaluate the impact of a targeted provider education module on AATD screening. We developed a web-based education module to address barriers to screening for AATD, deployed the education module using the Medscape Education platform, assessed perceived healthcare provider confidence in AATD screening, and conducted a prospective pre and postintervention study of AATD testing practices at a high-volume academic outpatient subspecialty pulmonary clinic. A total of 11,385 healthcare providers, including eight pulmonologists at our institution, completed the web-based education module. Confidence in identifying patients at high risk for AATD improved after completing the module (\"not confident\" in AATD screening was 7.7% postintervention compared with 19.4% preintervention). The rate of screening patients at high risk for AATD improved more than twofold (AATD screening rate 9.7% preintervention vs. 20.4% postintervention; <i>P</i> = 0.004). Among patients screened for AATD in our cohort, 27.2% had a genotype/phenotype or low alpha-1 antitrypsin concentration consistent with AATD. Targeted healthcare provider education can improve the confidence in testing for AATD. Improvements in provider confidence corresponded to improvements in AATD screening in a subspecialty pulmonary clinic. More than one-fourth of screening tests suggested AATD, underpinning the value of testing in high-risk individuals."

    "abstract": "There are no therapies to prevent emphysema progression. Chymotrypsin-like elastase 1 (CELA1) is a serine protease that binds and cleaves lung elastin in a stretch-dependent manner and is required for emphysema in a murine antisense oligonucleotide model of α-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency. This study tested whether CELA1 is important in strain-mediated lung matrix destruction in non-AAT-deficient emphysema and the efficacy of CELA1 neutralization. Airspace simplification was quantified after administration of tracheal porcine pancreatic elastase (PPE), after 8 months of cigarette smoke (CS) exposure, and in aging. In all 3 models, Cela1-/- mice had less emphysema and preserved lung elastin despite increased lung immune cells. A CELA1-neutralizing antibody was developed (KF4), and it inhibited stretch-inducible lung elastase in ex vivo mouse and human lung and immunoprecipitated CELA1 from human lung. In mice, systemically administered KF4 penetrated lung tissue in a dose-dependent manner and 5 mg/kg weekly prevented emphysema in the PPE model with both pre- and postinjury initiation and in the CS model. KF4 did not increase lung immune cells. CELA1-mediated lung matrix remodeling in response to strain is an important contributor to postnatal airspace simplification, and we believe that KF4 could be developed as a lung matrix-stabilizing therapy in emphysema."

Using a large cohort data of Danish mothers and children with AATD from 1973 to 2013 (n = 2,027,229), with 559 cases (305 mothers and 254 children). We conducted Poisson regression to examine associations between alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, adverse birth outcomes, and pregnancy complications in mothers and children. AATD was related to term low birth weight [<2500g; Risk Ratio(RR) = 2.04, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.50-2.79], lowest quartile of abdominal circumference at birth in children of non-smoking mothers (RR = 1.55, 95% CI: 1.14-2.11), delivery via Cesarean-section (RR = 1.59, 95% CI: 1.05-2.40), preterm birth (RR = 1.54, 95% CI: 1.19-2.00) and preeclampsia (RR = 2.64, 95% CI: 1.76-3.94). This emphasizes the need for mothers with AATD to be monitored closely during pregnancy to reduce the risk of adverse birth outcomes. Routine screening for alpha-1 antitrypsin in pregnancy may be considered among mothers with a pulmonary and liver disease history."

    "title": "Dipeptidyl peptidase 1 inhibition as a potential therapeutic approach in neutrophil-mediated inflammatory disease.",
    "abstract": "Neutrophils have a critical role in the innate immune response to infection and the control of inflammation. A key component of this process is the release of neutrophil serine proteases (NSPs), primarily neutrophil elastase, proteinase 3, cathepsin G, and NSP4, which have essential functions in immune modulation and tissue repair following injury. Normally, NSP activity is controlled and modulated by endogenous antiproteases. However, disruption of this homeostatic relationship can cause diseases in which neutrophilic inflammation is central to the pathology, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, bronchiectasis, and cystic fibrosis, as well as many non-pulmonary pathologies. Although the pathobiology of these diseases varies, evidence indicates that excessive NSP activity is common and a principal mediator of tissue damage and clinical decline. NSPs are synthesized as inactive zymogens and activated primarily by the ubiquitous enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase 1, also known as cathepsin C. Preclinical data confirm that inactivation of this protease reduces activation of NSPs. Thus, pharmacological inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase 1 potentially reduces the contribution of aberrant NSP activity to the severity and/or progression of multiple inflammatory diseases. Initial clinical data support this view. Ongoing research continues to explore the role of NSP activation by dipeptidyl peptidase 1 in different disease states and the potential clinical benefits of dipeptidyl peptidase 1 inhibition."

Data from 1283 men and 759 women (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) grades 1-4 or former grade 0, without alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency) of the COPD and Systemic Consequences Comorbidities Network cohort were analysed. Cumulative exposure to gases/fumes, biological dust, mineral dust or the combination vapours/gases/dusts/fumes was assessed using the ALOHA job exposure matrix. The effect of both occupational and smoking exposure on lung function and disease-specific QoL (St George's Respiratory Questionnaire) was analysed using linear regression analysis adjusting for age, body mass index, diabetes, hypertension and coronary artery disease, stratified by sex. In men, exposure to gases/fumes showed the strongest effects among occupational exposures, being significantly associated with all lung function parameters and QoL; the effects were partially stronger than of smoking. Smoking had a larger effect than occupational exposure on lung diffusing capacity (transfer factor for carbon monoxide) but not on air trapping (residual volume/total lung capacity). In women, occupational exposures were not significantly associated with QoL or lung function, while the relationships between lung function parameters and smoking were comparable to men. In patients with COPD, cumulative occupational exposure, particularly to gases/fumes, showed effects on airway obstruction, air trapping, gas uptake capacity and disease-related QoL, some of which were larger than those of smoking. These findings suggest that lung air trapping and QoL should be considered as outcomes of occupational exposure to gases and fumes in patients with COPD. NCT01245933."

PBC with features of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) has rarely been reported in pediatric patients with genetic defects. We present the case of an adolescent with chromosome 14q24.1q24.2 deletion who was given the diagnosis of stage IV PBC with features of AIH. A 19-year-old male adolescent with multiple congenital abnormalities and an intellectual disability presented with abnormal liver enzymes levels and pruritus for more than 5 years. Laboratory examinations revealed elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase. After the exclusion of viral hepatitis, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, Wilson's disease, and other genetic cholestatic liver diseases by laboratory tests and whole exome sequencing, a liver biopsy was performed and stage IV PBC was diagnosed. Notably, features of AIH were also noted in the histopathological report, indicating the presence of PBC with AIH features. The patient responded well to a combination therapy of ursodeoxycholic acid and steroids. Array comparative genomic hybridization analysis performed to study the congenital abnormalities revealed a 3.89 Mb 14q24.1q24.2 deletion. PBC with AIH features has rarely been reported in an adolescent with a chromosomal abnormality. The present case can increase awareness for early-onset PBC and its possible correlation with chromosomal defects."

    "abstract": "Most clinical laboratories quantify alpha-1 antitrypsin using either nephelometry or turbidimetry techniques because they are commercially available, amenable to automation, and precise. Both methods are based on light scatter. The foundation of both techniques is based on incubation of the specimen with anti-AAT polyclonal antibody solution, a polymer matrix between endogenous AAT and the reagent antibodies forms, leading to production of light-scattering large particles. Although these two terms are sometimes used synonymously, technically speaking they are not.Nephelometry measures the amount of turbidity or cloudiness of a solution by directly quantifying the intensity of the light scattered by insoluble particles in the sample. Therefore, this technique measures the light that passes through the sample, with the detector being placed at an angle from the sample. Turbidimetry is the process of measuring the loss of intensity of the light transmitted linearly through a sample caused by the scattering effect of insoluble particles. The decrease in light transmission is measured compared to a reference, and the absorbed light is quantified.Beyond specific technical differences between both techniques, there are two major differences between the two procedures that may influence the results. First, the concentration of the sample and the resulting intensity of scattered light relative to the intensity of the light source is one major factor. Second, the size of the scattering particles is also a key differentiating factor. This chapter describes the technical requirements, the different protocols, and the clinical applicability of these two techniques in the diagnosis of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency."

Various phenotyping and genotyping methodologies are available, and each has their own advantages and disadvantages. As an alternative, mass spectrometry is emerging as a powerful tool in the identification and quantitation of proteins and peptides. The method described here, referred to as proteotyping, is a proteomic method using trypsin digestion and tandem mass spectrometry that detects the most common deficiency alleles, S and Z, associated with A1AT deficiency.This qualitative mass spectrometry method is based on the principle that the S and Z mutations lead to amino acid changes which result in a change in the mass of the A1AT protein. When the A1AT protein is proteolytically digested, multiple peptides are generated, two of which include the sites of the S and Z mutations, respectively. Peptides generated from wild-type A1AT (M alleles) differ in sequence and mass from peptides generated from the S and Z alleles at these two specific locations. The mass difference allows for differentiation of S and Z peptides, representing the deficiency alleles, from non-S and non-Z peptides, representing the wild-type alleles (M). Interpretation of the peptide patterns in conjunction with A1AT quantitation by immunoassay allows for an accurate assessment for the presence of deficiency alleles in the majority of patients."

    "abstract": "Lung disease in alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) mainly results from insufficient control of the serine proteases neutrophil elastase (NE) and proteinase-3 due to reduced plasma levels of alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT) variants. Mutations in the specificity-determining reactive center loop (RCL) of AAT would be predicted to minimally affect protein folding and secretion by hepatocytes but can impair anti-protease activity or alter the target protease. These properly secreted but dysfunctional 'type-2' variants would not be identified by common diagnostic protocols that are predicated on a reduction in circulating AAT. This has potential clinical relevance: in addition to the dysfunctional Pittsburgh and Iners variants reported previously, several uncharacterized RCL variants are present in genome variation databases. To prospectively evaluate the impact of RCL variations on secretion and anti-protease activity, here we performed a systematic screening of amino acid substitutions occurring at the AAT-NE interface. Twenty-three AAT variants that can result from single nucleotide polymorphisms in this region, including 11 present in sequence variation databases, were expressed in a mammalian cell model. All demonstrated unaltered protein folding and secretion. However, when their ability to form stable complexes with NE was evaluated by western blot, enzymatic assays, and a novel ELISA developed to quantify AAT-NE complexes, substrate-like and NE-binding deficient dysfunctional variants were identified. This emphasizes the ability of the RCL to accommodate inactivating substitutions without impacting the integrity of the native molecule and demonstrates that this class of molecule violates a generally accepted paradigm that equates circulating levels with functional protection of lung tissue."

    "abstract": "Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a genetic disorder associated with a 5-tenfold decrease in lung levels of alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT) and an increased risk for obstructive lung disease. α-defensins are cationic broad-spectrum cytotoxic and pro-inflammatory peptides found in the azurophilic granules of neutrophils. The concentration of α-defensins is less than 30 nM in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of healthy controls but is up to 6 μM in AATD individuals with significant lung function impairment. Alveolar macrophages are generally classified into pro-inflammatory (M1) or anti-inflammatory (M2) subsets that play distinct roles in the initiation and resolution of inflammation. Therefore, monocyte-macrophage differentiation should be tightly controlled to maintain lung integrity. In this study, we determined the effect of α-defensins on monocyte-macrophage differentiation and identified the molecular mechanism of this effect. The results of this study demonstrate that 2.5 μM of α-defensins inhibit the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and STAT3 and suppress the expression of M2 macrophage markers, CD163 and CD206. In addition, a scratch assay shows that the high concentration of α-defensins inhibits cell movement by ~ 50%, and the phagocytosis assay using flow cytometry shows that α-defensins significantly reduce the bacterial phagocytosis rate of monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs). To examine whether exogenous AAT is able to alleviate the inhibitory effect of α-defensins on macrophage function, we incubated MDMs with AAT prior to α-defensin treatment and demonstrate that AAT improves the migratory ability and phagocytic ability of MDMs compared with MDMs incubated only with α-defensins. Taken together, this study suggests that a high concentration of α-defensins inhibits the activation of ERK/STAT3 signaling, negatively regulates the expression of M2 macrophage markers, and impairs innate immune function of macrophages."

This treatment has been available and remained basically unchanged for more than 35 years, but many questions persist regarding its indications, regimen of administration and efficacy. Because AATD is a rare disease, it has not been possible to conduct randomised, placebo-controlled trials that are adequately powered for the usual outcomes analysed in non-AATD-related COPD, such as lung function decline, exacerbations, symptoms or quality of life. New outcomes such as lung densitometry measured by computed tomography are more sensitive for identifying emphysema progression but are not widely accepted by regulatory agencies. In addition, clinical manifestations, severity and the natural history of lung disease associated with AATD are very heterogeneous, which means that individual prediction of prognosis is challenging. Therefore, the indication for augmentation is sometimes a dilemma between initiating treatment in individuals who may not develop significant lung disease or in whom disease will not progress and delaying it in patients who will otherwise rapidly and irreversibly progress.Other areas of debate are the possible indication for augmentation in patients with severe AATD and respiratory diseases other than emphysema, such as bronchiectasis or asthma, and the use of therapy after lung transplant in AATD patients. All these uncertainties imply that the indication for treatment must be personalised in expert reference centres after in-depth discussion of the pros and cons of augmentation with the patient."

The clinical course is highly variable. Some infants present with neonatal cholestasis, which can resolve spontaneously or progress to cirrhosis; others are well in infancy, only to develop portal hypertension later in childhood. The Childhood Liver Disease Research Network has been enrolling AATD participants into longitudinal, observational studies at North American tertiary centers since 2004. We examined the clinical courses of 2 subgroups of participants from the several hundred enrolled; first, those presenting with neonatal cholestasis captured by a unique study, enrolled because of neonatal cholestasis but before specific diagnosis, then followed longitudinally (n=46); second, separately, all participants who progressed to liver transplant (n=119). We found male predominance for neonatal cholestasis in AATD (65% male, p=0.04), an association of neonatal gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase elevation to more severe disease, and a higher rate of neonatal cholestasis progression to portal hypertension than previously reported (41%) occurring at median age of 5 months. Participants with and without preceding neonatal cholestasis were at risk of progression to transplant. Participants who progressed to liver transplant following neonatal cholestasis were significantly younger at transplant than those without neonatal cholestasis (4.1 vs. 7.8 years, p=0.04, overall range 0.3-17 years). Neonatal cholestasis had a negative impact on growth parameters. Coagulopathy and varices were common before transplant, but gastrointestinal bleeding was not. Patients with AATD and neonatal cholestasis are at risk of early progression to severe liver disease, but the risk of severe disease extends throughout childhood. Careful attention to nutrition and growth is needed."

We aim to identify AATD in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchiectasis, or asthma and to report the frequency of AAT variants in Turkey. This non-interventional, multicenter, prospective study was conducted between October 2021 and June 2022. Adult patients with COPD, bronchiectasis, asthma, liver symptoms, or family members with AATD were included. Demographic and clinical characteristics, pulmonary diagnosis, respiratory symptoms, and AAT serum levels were assessed. Whole blood samples were collected as dried blood spots, and the most common AATD mutations were simultaneously tested by allele-specific genotyping. A total of 1088 patients, mainly diagnosed with COPD (92.7%) and shortness of breath (78.7%), were assessed. Fifty-one (5%) were found to have AATD mutations. Fifteen (29.4%) patients had Pi*S or Pi*Z mutations, whereas 36 (70.6%) patients carried rare alleles Pi*M malton (n=18, 35.3% of mutations), Pi*I (n=8, 16%), Pi*P lowell (n=7, 14%), Pi*M heerlen (n=2, 4%), and Pi*S iiyama (n=1, 2%). The most common heterozygous combinations were Pi*M/Z (n=12, 24%), and Pi*M/M malton (n=11, 22%). Ten patients with severe AATD due to two deficiency alleles were identified, two with the Pi*Z/Z genotype, four with the genotype Pi*M malton/M malton, three with Pi*Z/M malton, and one with Pi*Z/M heerlen. Our results identified AATD mutations as a genetic-based contributor to lung disease in patients with COPD or bronchiectasis and assessed their frequency in a population of Turkish patients."

    "title": "Initial alpha-1 antitrypsin screening in Turkish patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.",
    "abstract": "Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency is associated with several types of pathology, and the reported effects of mutations in the ATT-encoding gene vary worldwide. No Turkish study has yet appeared. We thus explored the AAT status of Turkish patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This prospective cross-sectional study included outpatients and inpatients treated from June 2021 to June 2022. Serum AAT levels were checked, and dry blood samples were subjected to genetic analysis. : Genetic mutations were found in 21 (3.52%) of 596 patients with prior and new COPD diagnoses treated in our pneumonology outpatient department. The mean serum AAT level was 114.80 mg/dL (minimum 19, maximum 209; standard deviation 27.86 mg/dL). The most frequent mutation was M/Plowell (23.8%, n = 5), followed by M/S (23.8%, n = 5), M/I (19%, n = 4), M/Malton (14.3%, n = 3), Z/Z (9.5%, n = 2), M/Z (4.8%, n = 1), and Kayseri/Kayseri (4.8%, n = 1). Thoracic computed tomography revealed that 85.7% (n = 18) of all patients had emphysema, 28.5% (n = 6) had bronchiectasis, and 28.5% (n = 6) had mass lesions. Of the emphysema patients, 55% (n = 10) had only upper lobe emphysema, and 83.3% (n = 15) had emphysema in additional areas, but statistical significance was lacking (p > 0.05). In patients with emphysema and normal serum AAT levels, genetic analyses may reveal relevant heterozygous mutations, which are commonly ignored. Most clinicians focus on lower lobe emphysema. Evaluations of such patients might reveal AAT mutations that are presently overlooked because they are not considered to influence COPD status."

    "abstract": "Alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a hereditary codominant autosomal disease. This liver disease ranges from asymptomatic cases to terminal illness, which makes early recognition and diagnosis challenging. It is the main cause of pediatric liver transplantation after biliary atresia. To describe the clinical characteristics, as well as those of histologic and laboratory tests, phenotypic and/or genetic evaluation and evolution of a cohort of pediatric patients with AATD. This is a retrospective observational study of 39 patients with confirmed or probable AATD (without phenotyping or genotyping, but with suggestive clinical features, low serum alpha 1-antitrypsin (AAT) level and liver biopsy with PAS granules, resistant diastasis). Clinical, laboratory and histological varia-bles, presence of portal hypertension (PH) and survival with native liver have been analyzed. A total of 66.7% of 39 patients were male (26/39). The initial manifestation was cholestatic jaundice in 79.5% (31/39). Liver transplantation was performed in 28.2% (11/39) of patients. Diagnosis occurred at an average of 3.1 years old and liver transplantation at 4.1 years of age. 89.2% (25/28) of the patients with confirmed AATD were PI*ZZ or ZZ. The average AAT value on admission for PI*ZZ or ZZ patients was 41.6 mg/dL. All transplanted patients with phenotyping or genotyping were PI*ZZ (or ZZ). Those who were jaundiced on admission were earlier referred to the specialized service and had higher levels of GGT and platelets on admission. There was no significant difference in the survival curve when comparing cholestatic jaundiced to non-cholestatic jaundiced patients on admission. Comparing patients who did or did not progress to PH, higher levels of AST and APRI score at diagnosis (P=0.011 and P=0.026, respectively) were observed and in the survival curves patients with PH showed impairment, with 20.2% survival with native liver in 15 years. Jaundice is an important clinical sign that motivates referral to a specialist, but it does not seem to compromise survival with native liver. Patients progressing to PH had higher AST, APRi score on admission and significantly impaired survival with native liver. It is important to pay attention to these signs in the follow-up of patients with AATD."

    "abstract": "The longitudinal health status of Danish children with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency had never previously been characterised. This study aimed to assess the changes in growth, lung and liver function through childhood in these children. Danish children diagnosed between 2005 and 2020 with pathogenic variants in the Serpin family A member 1 gene were included. Retrospective data on growth, lung and liver parameters were obtained from local databases. Anthropometric Z-scores and composite liver scores were computed. Growth and blood results were analysed using robust linear mixed models. The study included 184 children (68 with ZZ-homozygosity, 116 with heterozygosity). The median follow-up time was 7 years [IQR 3.75-9.00] for children with ZZ-homozygosity and 0.5 years [IQR 0.0-2.0] for children with heterozygosity. Both groups had low weight-for-height Z-scores at diagnosis but experienced catch-up growth during the first year of life. In addition, children with ZZ-homozygosity had higher serum concentrations of γ-glutamyl transferase and alanine aminotransferase throughout childhood, when compared with children with heterozygosity. Data proved insufficient to assess lung function properly. Children with ZZ-homozygosity were more affected on serum liver parameters throughout childhood when compared with children with heterozygosity. Both groups experienced catch-up growth during the first year of life."

AATD patients face challenges such as under diagnosis, clinical variability, and limited treatment options for liver disease. Early detection and biomarkers for predicting outcomes are needed to improve patient outcome. Currently, the only approved pharmacological therapy is augmentation therapy, which can delay the progression of emphysema. However, alternative strategies such as gene therapy, induced pluripotent stem cells, and prevention of AAT polymerization inside hepatocytes are being investigated. This review aims to summarize and update current knowledge on AATD, identify areas of controversy, and formulate questions for further research."

However, studies of the risk factors of prolonged diarrhea remain limited. This study aimed to analyze the risk factors for prolonged diarrhea in children under 2 years of age with acute diarrhea. This 1-year nested case-control study was conducted at Fatmawati General Hospital in 2021-2022. Participants were selected using a consecutive sampling method from among children under 2 years of age with acute diarrhea within the previous 2-4 days. Children with diarrhea that lasted 7 days were considered positive for prolonged diarrhea, whereas those with acute diarrhea were considered negative. Children with comorbidities such as malnutrition were excluded. Clinical information including age, breastfeeding history, antibiotic exposure history, and nutritional status was recorded. Complete blood count, blood zinc levels, Rotavirus, adenovirus, and norovirus serology, alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) levels, and stool analysis were acquired as laboratory data. There were 62 subjects in the study and control groups. Overall, the median age was 12 months (6-24 months); most patients were boys. A history of antibiotic use (odds ratio [OR], 15.860; 95% confidence interval [CI], 5.286-47.591; P<0.001), zinc deficiency (OR, 4.758; 95% CI, 1.711-13.229; P=0.003), and elevated fecal AAT levels (OR, 2.677; 95% CI, 1.046-6.850; P=0.040) were the main risk factors for prolonged diarrhea in children under 2 years of age with acute diarrhea. A history of antibiotic use, zinc deficiency, and elevated fecal AAT levels were the main risk factors for prolonged diarrhea in children under 2 years of age with acute diarrhea. Thorough testing and appropriate antibiotic use are required to prevent prolonged diarrhea in children under 2 years of age."

Here, we present baseline characteristics and select biomarkers of study subjects. The methodology of FOOTPRINTS<sup>®</sup> has been published previously. The study population included ex-smokers with a range of COPD severities (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease [GOLD] stages 1-3), ex-smokers with COPD and alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency (A1ATD) and a control group of ex-smokers without airflow limitation (EwAL). At study entry, data were collected for: demographics, disease characteristics, history of comorbidities and COPD exacerbations, symptoms, lung function and volume, exercise capacity, soluble biomarkers, and quantitative and qualitative computed tomography. Baseline data are presented with descriptive statistical comparisons for soluble biomarkers in the individual GOLD and A1ATD groups versus EwAL. In total, 463 subjects were enrolled. The per-protocol set comprised 456 subjects, mostly male (64.5%). The mean (standard deviation) age was 60.7 (6.9) years. At baseline, increasing pulmonary symptoms, worse lung function, increased residual volume, reduced diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLco) and greater prevalence of centrilobular emphysema were observed with increasing disease severity amongst GOLD 1-3 subjects. Subjects with A1ATD (n = 19) had similar lung function parameters to GOLD 2-3 subjects, a high residual volume comparable to GOLD 3 subjects, and similar air trapping to GOLD 2 subjects. Compared with EwAL (n = 61), subjects with A1ATD had worse lung function, increased residual volume, reduced DLco, and a greater prevalence of confluent or advanced destructive emphysema. The soluble inflammatory biomarkers white blood cell count, fibrinogen, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and plasma surfactant protein were higher in GOLD 1-3 groups than in the EwAL group. Interleukin-6 was expressed less often in EwAL subjects compared with subjects in the GOLD and A1ATD groups. Soluble receptor for advanced glycation end product was lowest in GOLD 3 subjects, indicative of more severe emphysema. These findings provide context for upcoming results from FOOTPRINTS<sup>®</sup>, which aims to establish correlations between biomarkers and disease progression in a representative COPD population.

    "title": "Circulating Mitochondrial DNA Is Associated With High Levels of Fatigue in Two Independent Sarcoidosis Cohorts.",
    "abstract": "Patients with sarcoidosis who develop severe clinical phenotypes of pulmonary fibrosis or multiorgan disease experience debilitating symptoms, with fatigue being a common chief complaint. Studies that have investigated this patient-related outcome measure (PROM) have used the Fatigue Assessment Scale (FAS), a self-reported questionnaire that reflects mental and physical domains. Despite extensive work, its cause is unknown and treatment options remain limited. Previously, we showed that the plasma of patients with sarcoidosis with extrapulmonary disease endorsing fatigue was enriched for mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), a ligand for the innate immune receptor toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9). Through our cross-disciplinary platform, we investigated a relationship between sarcoidosis-induced fatigue and circulating mtDNA. Is there a psychobiologic mechanism that connects sarcoidosis-induced fatigue and mtDNA-mediated TLR9 activation? Using a local cohort of patients at Yale (discovery cohort) and the National Institutes of Health-sponsored Genomic Research in Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency and Sarcoidosis study (validation cohort), we scored the FAS and quantified in the plasma, mtDNA concentrations, TLR9 activation, and cytokine levels. Although FAS scores were independent of corticosteroid use and Scadding stage, we observed a robust association between FAS scores, which included mental and physical domains, and multiorgan sarcoidosis. Subsequently, we identified a significant correlation between plasma mtDNA concentrations and all domains of fatigue. Additionally, we found that TLR9 activation is associated with all aspects of the FAS and partially mediates this PROM through mtDNA. Last, we found that TLR9-associated soluble mediators in the plasma are independent of all facets of fatigue. Through our cross-disciplinary translational platform, we identified a previously unrecognized psychobiologic connection between sarcoidosis-induced fatigue and circulating mtDNA concentrations. Mechanistic work that investigates the contribution of mtDNA-mediated innate immune activation in this PROM and clinical studies with prospective cohorts has the potential to catalyze novel therapeutic strategies for this patient population and those with similar conditions."

To understand the prevalence, burden and progression of liver disease in patients with APPM including alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. We conducted a retrospective analysis of anonymized patient-level claims data from a German health insurance provider (AOK PLUS). The APPM cohort comprised patients with APPM (identified using the German Modification of the International Classification of Diseases-10<sup>th</sup> Revision [ICD-10-GM] code E88.0 between 01/01/2010-30/09/2020) and incident liver disease (ICD-10-GM codes K74, K70.2-3 and K71.7 between 01/01/2012-30/09/2020). The control cohort comprised patients without APPM but with incident liver disease. Outcomes were incidence/prevalence of liver disease in patients with APPM, demographics/baseline characteristics, diagnostic procedures, progression-free survival (PFS), disease progression and mortality. Overall, 2680 and 26299 patients were included in the APPM (fibrosis, 96; cirrhosis, 2584) and control (fibrosis, 1444; cirrhosis, 24855) cohorts, respectively. Per 100000 individuals, annual incidence and prevalence of APPM and liver disease was 10-15 and 36-51, respectively. In the APPM cohort, median survival was 4.7 years [95% confidence interval (CI): 3.5-7.0] and 2.5 years (95%CI: 2.3-2.8) in patients with fibrosis and cirrhosis, respectively. A higher proportion of patients in the APPM cohort experienced disease progression (92.0%) compared with the control cohort (67.2%). Median PFS was shorter in the APPM cohort (0.9 years, 95%CI: 0.7-1.1) compared with the control cohort (3.7 years, 95%CI: 3.6-3.8; <i>P</i> < 0.001). Patients with cirrhosis in the control cohort had longer event-free survival for ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, hepatic failure and esophageal/gastric varices than patients with cirrhosis in the APPM cohort (<i>P</i> < 0.001). Patients with fibrosis in the control cohort had longer event-free survival for ascites, cirrhosis, hepatic failure and esophageal/gastric varices than patients with fibrosis in the APPM cohort (<i>P</i> < 0.001). In the APPM cohort, the most common diagnostic procedures within 12 mo after the first diagnosis of liver disease were imaging procedures (66.3%) and laboratory tests (51.0%). Among patients with liver disease, those with APPM experience substantial burden and earlier liver disease progression than patients without APPM."

However, this standard dose may not be optimal for all patients. Body weight-based dosing, alternative dosing regimens, and treatment interruption periods were evaluated using population pharmacokinetic (PopPK) modeling and simulations. A nonlinear mixed-effects PopPK model with covariate effects was developed using data from 3 clinical studies investigating 60 mg/kg QW IV A1PI infusions in patients with AATD (n = 65) to evaluate A1PI pharmacokinetic (PK) characteristics. Model-based simulations were conducted for predefined body weight categories, alternative dosing regimens (60-180 mg/kg QW or once every 2 weeks [Q2W]), and treatment interruption periods ranging from 3 to 14 days. A1PI PK characteristics were well described by a 2-compartment turnover model with zero-order input and linear elimination. Body weight was a statistically significant determinant of variability in central volume of distribution. Model-based simulations suggested that patients with a higher body weight may attain the 11 μM threshold quicker than patients with a lower body weight and that QW dosing was better at maintaining A1PI levels >11 μM, even when higher Q2W doses were administered. Missing a dose for as few as 3 days could result in A1PI levels <11 μM. Findings suggest that doses higher than 60 mg/kg administered QW might be more clinically beneficial in some patients with AATD, and that body weight should be considered in dose optimization."

The objective of this study was to measure muscle mass in school-aged children with genetic intrahepatic cholestasis and assess relationships between sarcopenia, clinical variables, and outcomes. Estimated skeletal muscle mass (eSMM) was calculated on dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry obtained in a Childhood Liver Disease Research Network study of children with bile acid synthesis disorders(BASD) alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (a1ATd), chronic intrahepatic cholestasis (CIC), and Alagille syndrome (ALGS). Relationships between eSMM, liver disease, and transplant-free survival were assessed. eSMM was calculated in 127 participants (5-18 y): 12 BASD, 41 a1ATd, 33 CIC, and 41 ALGS. eSMM z-score was lower in CIC (-1.6 ± 1.3) and ALGS (-2.1 ± 1.0) than BASD (-0.1 ± 1.1) and a1ATd (-0.5 ± 0.8, p < 0.001). Sarcopenia (defined as eSMM z-score ≤- 2) was present in 33.3% of CIC and 41.5% of ALGS participants. eSMM correlated with bone mineral density in the 4 disease groups (r=0.52-0.55, p < 0.001-0.07), but not serum bile acids, bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase/platelet ratio index, or clinically evident portal hypertension. Of the 2 patients who died (1 with sarcopenia) and 18 who underwent liver transplant (LT, 4 with sarcopenia), eSMM z-score did not predict transplant-free survival. eSMM z-score correlated with the Physical Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory score (r=0.38-0.53, p = 0.007-0.04) in CIC and a1ATd. Severe sarcopenia occurs in some children with ALGS and CIC. The lack of correlation between eSMM and biochemical cholestasis suggests mechanisms beyond cholestasis contribute to sarcopenia. While sarcopenia did not predict transplant-free survival, LT and death were infrequent events. Future studies may define mechanisms of sarcopenia in genetic intrahepatic cholestasis."

The uninhibited elastase activity on the elastic tissue of arterial walls suggests that AATD may also impact vascular health.

A systematic literature search was conducted in the main scientific databases according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Differences between cases and controls were expressed as odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). The protocol was registered on PROSPERO under the identification number CRD42023429756. The analysis of eight studies showed that, with a prevented fraction of disease of 15.0% and a corresponding OR of 0.779 (95%CI: 0.665-0.912; <i>p</i> = 0.002), a total of 24,428 individuals with AATD exhibited a significantly lower risk of ischemic heart disease compared to 534,654 non-AATD controls.

    "abstract": "Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a genetic disorder characterized by mutations in the SERPINA1 gene, primarily affecting the lungs and liver. The COVID-19 pandemic has raised questions about the susceptibility of individuals with AATD to COVID-19 and whether patients with rare lung disease might experience increased stress-related symptoms and mental health challenges. This study aims to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the quality of life of individuals living with AATD. The study enrolled participants from the German registry for individuals with AATD. Questionnaires were sent to the 1250 participants, and a total of 358 patients were included in the analysis. The primary objective was to examine the influence of sociodemographic and disease-related factors on the occurrence of stress-related symptoms. This was accomplished through correlation and regression analyses. We also investigated the role of baseline quality of life (QoL), as measured by the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), as a mediator of this relationship. Stress-related symptoms were predicted by young age, female gender, psychological disorders, and a history of exacerbations of lung disease, as determined by multiple regression analysis. QoL as measured by the SGRQ mediated the relationship between poor lung function, stress, and a decline in overall well-being. The presented data demonstrate that the COVID-19 pandemic significantly affects the psychological well-being of patients with rare diseases, leading to increased levels of anxiety and stress. Disease-related factors can exacerbate stress manifestations, especially when compounded by sociodemographic and contextual factors. Thus, our study emphasizes the crucial role of taking these factors into account when managing individuals with AATD in pandemic situations."

    "abstract": "Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a metabolic disease characterized by hyperglycemia and can affect multiple organs, leading to life-threatening complications. Increased prevalence of pulmonary disease is observed in T1D patients, and diabetes is a leading cause of comorbidity in several lung pathologies. A deficiency of alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) can lead to the development of emphysema. Decreased AAT plasma concentrations and anti-protease activity are documented in T1D patients. The objective of this study was to determine whether T1D exacerbates the progression of lung damage in AAT deficiency. First, pulmonary function testing (PFT) and histopathological changes in the lungs of C57BL/6J streptozotocin (STZ)-induced T1D mice were investigated 3 and 6 months after the onset of hyperglycemia. PFT demonstrated a restrictive pulmonary pattern in the lungs of STZ-injected mice, along with upregulation of mRNA expression of pro-fibrotic markers Acta2, Ccn2, and Fn1. Increased collagen deposition was observed 6 months after the onset of hyperglycemia. To study the effect of T1D on the progression of lung damage in AAT deficiency background, C57BL/6J AAT knockout (KO) mice were used. Control and STZ-challenged AAT KO mice did not show significant changes in lung function 3 months after the onset of hyperglycemia. However, histological examination of the lung demonstrated increased collagen accumulation and alveolar space enlargement in STZ-induced AAT KO mice. AAT pretreatment on TGF-β-stimulated primary lung fibroblasts reduced mRNA expression of pro-fibrotic markers ACTA2, CCN2, and FN1. Induction of T1D in AAT deficiency leads to a combined pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema (CPFE) phenotype in male mice."

    "title": "Pulmonary Rehabilitation for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Patients with Underlying Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency: A Systematic Review and Practical Recommendations.",
    "abstract": "Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is an often-overlooked genetic condition that makes individuals susceptible to early onset of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The established benefits of exercise-based pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) for usual COPD patients are unclear for those with underlying AATD, especially given potentially differing muscle adaptations to exercise. This review seeks to compare PR outcomes between AATD and usual COPD patients and to consolidate current knowledge on exercise intervention outcomes for the AATD population. A thorough search of 4 databases (Ovid, Medline, CINAHL, CENTRAL) was conducted based on 3 search concepts: (1) alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, (2) pulmonary rehabilitation OR exercise, and (3) muscle morphology. A dual review process and quality assessment were independently implemented throughout all stages of the review. Four studies highlighted modest exercise capacity and quality of life in AATD patients undergoing PR. However, one study reported unique muscle and mitochondrial responses compared to usual COPD patients. Additionally, a moderate exercise session did not alter pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in AATD patients, despite higher levels of tumor necrosis factor-α levels in muscle biopsies compared to usual COPD patients. The current literature base insufficiently addresses the efficacy of PR on AATD, with indications that exercise adaptation may deviate from that of usual COPD patients. Further research is needed to optimize PR, particularly in identifying the most suitable exercise intensity, and delivery setting, and addressing specific educational needs for individuals with AATD."

    "abstract": "Currently, the identification of new cases of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) continues to be one of the great challenges facing the disease. The present study aims to perform an analysis of the results of the implementation of a systematic case detection program of AATD for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Cross-sectional observational study in which the results of AAT screening until December 2022 were analyzed. The cases studied were divided into three periods: (1) no systematic case detection until 2013; (2) systematic case detection of S and Z alleles for cases with AAT < 90 mg/dL until 2018, and (3) systematic case detection of 14 mutations for cases with AAT < 120 mg/dL since 2018. A total of 471 cases were studied, of which 306 (65.0%) were carriers of some mutation related to HAD. The number of detected cases of all mutations with their percentage against those studied in each period was respectively: 6 (100%), 48 (88.8%) and 253 (61.5%). If we limit to severe mutations (AAT < 57.2 mg/dL), the distribution by periods was respectively: 3 (50.0), 10 (18.5%) and 17 (4.1%). The present study describes the changes in the detection of patients carrying DAAT-related alleles with three different case identification policies. The data support the use of systematic case detection system in the COPD patient population."

    "abstract": "Lung transplantation is recommended for select patients with end-stage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, a consensus has not been reached regarding the optimal choice of lung transplantation: single lung transplants (SLTs) vs bilateral lung transplants (BLTs). This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of SLT compared with BLT in managing end-stage COPD. Cochrane, Embase, PubMed, and Scopus were searched for articles by 2 independent reviewers using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis system. The review was registered prospectively with PROSPERO (CRD42022343408). Seven studies of 311 screened met the eligibility criteria, with a total of 10,652 patients with end-stage COPD, SLT (n = 6233), or BLT (n = 4419). Overall survival rates of BLT group were more favorable than SLT group at 1 (odds ratio [OR] = 1.29, 95% CI: 1.16, 1.43, I<sup>2</sup> = 0%), 5 (OR = 1.46, 95% CI: 1.35, 1.58, I<sup>2</sup> = 23%), and 10 years (OR = 1.71, 95% CI: 1.57, 1.87, I<sup>2</sup> = 12%) as well as the hazard ratio (HR = 0.73, 95% CI: 0.70, 0.76, I<sup>2</sup> = 40%). Subgroup analysis on survival rates of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency also displayed a trend favoring BLT compared with SLT at 1 (OR = 1.60, 95% CI: 1.24, 2.08, I<sup>2</sup> = 28%), 5 (OR = 1.84, 95% CI: 1.50, 2.26, I<sup>2</sup> = 42%), and 10 years (OR = 1.98, 95% CI: 1.59, 2.48, I<sup>2</sup> = 47%) as well as the HR (HR = 0.67, 95% CI: 0.35, 1.28, I<sup>2</sup> = 82%). Compared with SLT, BLT seems to demonstrate more favorable trends in survival rates for the management of end-stage COPD. Despite the promising results, the groups have significant heterogeneity in baseline characteristics. Further prospective studies with extended follow-up periods are needed to ascertain the efficacy of treatment."

    "title": "Protein Phosphatase 2A as a Therapeutic Target in Pulmonary Diseases.",
    "abstract": "New disease targets and medicinal chemistry approaches are urgently needed to develop novel therapeutic strategies for treating pulmonary diseases. Emerging evidence suggests that reduced activity of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), a complex heterotrimeric enzyme that regulates dephosphorylation of serine and threonine residues from many proteins, is observed in multiple pulmonary diseases, including lung cancer, smoke-induced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, asthma, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Loss of PP2A responses is linked to many mechanisms associated with disease progressions, such as senescence, proliferation, inflammation, corticosteroid resistance, enhanced protease responses, and mRNA stability. Therefore, chemical restoration of PP2A may represent a novel treatment for these diseases. This review outlines the potential impact of reduced PP2A activity in pulmonary diseases, endogenous and exogenous inhibitors of PP2A, details the possible PP2A-dependent mechanisms observed in these conditions, and outlines potential therapeutic strategies for treatment. Substantial medicinal chemistry efforts are underway to develop therapeutics targeting PP2A activity. The development of specific activators of PP2A that selectively target PP2A holoenzymes could improve our understanding of the function of PP2A in pulmonary diseases. This may lead to the development of therapeutics for restoring normal PP2A responses within the lung."

In a nationwide nested study of 2209 patients with α<sub>1</sub>-antitrypsin deficiency and 21 869 controls without α<sub>1</sub>-antitrypsin deficiency matched on age, sex and municipality, we recorded admissions and deaths due to heart failure during a median follow-up of 62 years. We also studied a population-based cohort of another 102 481 individuals from the Copenhagen General Population Study including 187 patients from the Danish α<sub>1</sub>-Antitrypsin Deficiency Registry, all with genetically confirmed α<sub>1</sub>-antitrypsin deficiency. Individuals with <i>versus</i> without α<sub>1</sub>-antitrypsin deficiency had increased risk of heart failure hospitalisation in the nationwide cohort (adjusted hazard ratio 2.64, 95% CI 2.25-3.10) and in the population-based cohort (1.77, 95% CI 1.14-2.74).

Can a reported respiratory and hepatic disease history from a large AATD testing database be used to stratify a person's risk of severe AATD? We analysed data extracted from the AATD National Detection Program. Demographics and medical history were evaluated to predict AATD PI*ZZ genotype. Logistic regression and integer programming models identified predictors and obtained risk scores. These were internally validated on a subset of the data. Out of 301 343 subjects, 1529 (0.5%) had PI*ZZ genotype. Predictors of severe AATD were asthma, bronchitis, emphysema, allergies, bronchiectasis, family history of AATD, cirrhosis, hepatitis and history of abnormal liver function tests. The derived model establishes a subject's risk of severe AATD, and scores ≥0 had an estimated risk of 0.41%, sensitivity 84.62% and specificity 24.32%. A model simulating guideline recommendations had an estimated risk of 0.51% with a sensitivity of 37.98% and specificity 46.60%. By recommending screening for scores ≥0, we estimate that more subjects would be screened (75.7% <i>versus</i> 53.4%) and detected (84.6% <i>versus</i> 58.2%) compared to a guideline-simulated model. This medical history risk model is a useful predictive tool to detect subjects at greater risk of having severe AATD and improves sensitivity of detection. Scores <0 are at lower risk and may need not be screened; testing is recommended for scores ≥0 and consistent with current guidelines."

To characterise patients with AATD Pi*ZZ and liver disease (AATD-LD-Pi*ZZ) with or without lung disease and describe liver disease-related clinical events longitudinally. This was an observational cohort study of patients in the Mayo Clinic Healthcare System (January 2000-September 2021). Patients were identified using diagnosis codes and natural language processing. Fibrosis stage (F0-F4) was assessed using a hierarchical approach at baseline (90 days before or after the index date) and follow-up. Clinical events associated with liver disease progression were assessed. AATD-LD-Pi*ZZ patients with lung disease had a longer median time from AATD diagnosis to liver disease diagnosis versus those without lung disease (2.2 vs. 0.2 years, respectively). Compared to those without lung disease, patients with lung disease had a longer time to liver disease-related clinical events (8.5 years and not reached, respectively). AATD-LD-Pi*ZZ patients without lung disease were more likely to undergo liver transplantation compared with those with lung disease. In patients with AATD and lung disease, there is a delay in the diagnosis of comorbid liver disease. Our findings suggest that liver disease may progress more rapidly in patients without comorbid lung disease."

    "abstract": "α1-Antitrypsin (AAT) is a major protease inhibitor produced by hepatocytes. The most relevant AAT mutation giving rise to AAT deficiency (AATD), the 'Pi∗Z' variant, causes harmful AAT protein accumulation in the liver, shortage of AAT in the systemic circulation, and thereby predisposes to liver and lung injury. Although intravenous AAT augmentation constitutes an established treatment of AATD-associated lung disease, its impact on the liver is unknown. Liver-related parameters were assessed in a multinational cohort of 760 adults with severe AATD (Pi∗ZZ genotype) and available liver phenotyping, of whom 344 received augmentation therapy and 416 did not. Liver fibrosis was evaluated noninvasively via the serum test AST-to-platelet ratio index and via transient elastography-based liver stiffness measurement. Histologic parameters were compared in 15 Pi∗ZZ adults with and 35 without augmentation. Compared with nonaugmented subjects, augmented Pi∗ZZ individuals displayed lower serum liver enzyme levels (AST 71% vs 75% upper limit of normal, P < .001; bilirubin 49% vs 58% upper limit of normal, P = .019) and lower surrogate markers of fibrosis (AST-to-platelet ratio index 0.34 vs 0.38, P < .001; liver stiffness measurement 6.5 vs 7.2 kPa, P = .005). Among biopsied participants, augmented individuals had less pronounced liver fibrosis and less inflammatory foci but no differences in AAT accumulation were noted. The first evaluation of AAT augmentation on the Pi∗ZZ-related liver disease indicates liver safety of a widely used treatment for AATD-associated lung disease. Prospective studies are needed to confirm the beneficial effects and to demonstrate the potential efficacy of exogenous AAT in patients with Pi∗ZZ-associated liver disease."

    "abstract": "Systemic diseases of liver origin (SDLO) are complex diseases in multiple organ systems, such as cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, endocrine, renal, respiratory, and sensory organ systems, caused by irregular liver metabolism and production of functional factors. Examples of such diseases discussed in this article include primary hyperoxaluria, familial hypercholesterolemia, acute hepatic porphyria, hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis, hemophilia, atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases, <i>α</i>-1 antitrypsin deficiency-associated liver disease, and complement-mediated diseases. Nucleic acid therapeutics use nucleic acids and related compounds as therapeutic agents to alter gene expression for therapeutic purposes. The two most promising, fastest-growing classes of nucleic acid therapeutics are antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). For each listed SDLO disease, this article discusses epidemiology, symptoms, genetic causes, current treatment options, and advantages and disadvantages of nucleic acid therapeutics by either ASO or siRNA drugs approved or under development. Furthermore, challenges and future perspectives on adverse drug reactions and toxicity of ASO and siRNA drugs for the treatment of SDLO diseases are also discussed. In summary, this review article will highlight the clinical advantages of nucleic acid therapeutics in targeting the liver for the treatment of SDLO diseases. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Systemic diseases of liver origin (SDLO) contain rare and common complex diseases caused by irregular functions of the liver. Nucleic acid therapeutics have shown promising clinical advantages to treat SDLO. This article aims to provide the most updated information on targeting the liver with antisense oligonucleotides and small interfering RNA drugs. The generated knowledge may stimulate further investigations in this growing field of new therapeutic entities for the treatment of SDLO, which currently have no or limited options for treatment."

    "abstract": "Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT1) deficiency (AAT1D) is an inherited disease with an increased risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), liver disease, and skin and blood vessel problems. AAT1D is caused by mutations in the SERPINE1 gene (Serine Protease Inhibitor, group A, member 1). Numerous variants of this gene, the Pi system, have been identified. The most frequent allelic variants are Pi*M, Pi*S, and Pi*Z. The development of COPD requires both a genetic predisposition and the contribution of an environmental factor, smoking being the most important. Studies on this deficiency worldwide are very scarce, and it is currently considered a rare disease because it is underdiagnosed. The aim of this study was to analyze the genotypic frequencies of mutations associated with AAT1 deficiency in unrelated bone marrow donors from the donor registry of the Region of Murcia in southeastern Spain due to the high risk of presenting with different pathologies and underdiagnosis in the population. A total of 112 DNA-healthy voluntary unrelated bone marrow donors from different parts of the Region of Murcia were analyzed retrospectively. AAT1 deficiency patient testing involved an automated biochemical screening routine. The three main variants, Pi*M, Pi*Z, and Pi*S, were analyzed in the SERPINE1 gene. Our results showed a frequency of 3.12% of the Pi*Z (K342) mutation in over 224 alleles tested in the healthy population. The frequency of Pi*S (V264) was 11.1%. The frequency of the haplotype with the most dangerous mutation, EK342 EE264, was 4.46%, and the frequency of EK342 EV264 was 1.78% in the healthy population. Frequencies of other EE342 EV264-mutated haplotypes accounted for 18.7%. As for the EE342 VV264 haplotype, 0.89% of the total healthy population presented heterozygous for the EV264 mutation and one individual presented homozygous for the VV264 mutation. In conclusion, the frequencies of Pi mutations in the healthy population of the Region of Murcia were not remarkably different from the few studies reported in Spain. The genotype and haplotype frequencies followed the usual pattern. Health authorities should be aware of this high prevalence of the Pi*S allelic variant and pathological genotypes such as Pi*MZ and Pi*SZ in the healthy population if they consider screening the smoking population."

    "abstract": "A deficiency in alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT1) is a rare disorder that represents a significant health threat and early diagnostic priority issue. We investigated the usefulness of the serum protein electrophoresis (SPE) as an opportunistic screening tool for AAT1 deficiency. For 6 months, all SPE carried out for any reasons were evaluated in our center. In those with less than 3% of alpha-1 globulins, AAT1 concentrations were studied. The <i>SERPINA1</i> gene was subsequently sequenced in those patients displaying concentrations below 100 mg/dL. Out of the total, 14 patients (0.3%) were identified with low AAT1 concentrations, with 11 of them agreeing to enter the study. Of those, mutations in the <i>SERPINA1</i> gene were discovered in 10 patients (91%). Heterozygous mutations were detected in seven patients; three had the c.1096G>A mutation (p.Glu366Lys; Pi*Z), two had the c.863A>T mutation (p.Glu288Val; Pi*S), one had the c.221_223delTCT mutation (p.Phe76del; Pi*Malton), and the last one had the c.1066G>A (p.Ala356Thr) mutation, which was not previously described. Finally, one patient had the c.863A>T mutation in homozygosis, whereas two double heterozygous patients c.863A>T/c.1096G>A were detected. An altered result in the concentration of AAT1 anticipates a mutation in the <i>SERPINA1</i> gene in a manner close to 91%. The relationship between a decrease in the alpha-1 globulin band of the SPE and an alteration in the AAT1 concentration is direct in basal states of health. The SPE is presented as a highly sensitive test for opportunistic screening of AAT1 deficiency."

    "abstract": "Patients with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) exhibit dysregulated inflammatory responses and a predilection for autoimmunity. While the adverse event (AE) profiles of COVID-19 vaccines in several chronic inflammatory conditions are now available, safety and tolerability data for patients with severe AATD have yet to be described. The feasibility of coadministering vaccines against COVID-19 and influenza in this population is similarly unclear. We conducted a prospective study of 170 patients with Pi*ZZ genotype AATD receiving their initial vaccination series with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AstraZeneca). Patients were monitored clinically for AEs over the week that followed their first and second doses. In parallel, we conducted the same assessments in patients with Pi*MM genotype chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (n=160) and Pi*MM individuals without lung disease (n=150). The Pi*ZZ cohort was subsequently followed through 2 consecutive mRNA-based booster vaccines (monovalent and bivalent BNT162b2, Pfizer/BioNTech). To assess the safety of combined vaccination against COVID-19 and influenza, the quadrivalent influenza vaccine was administered to participants attending for their second COVID-19 booster vaccination, either on the same day or following a 1-week interval. Pi*ZZ AATD participants did not display increased AEs compared to Pi*MM COPD or Pi*MM non-lung disease controls. Although unexpected and serious vaccine-associated AEs did occur, the majority of AEs experienced across the 3 groups were mild and self-limiting. The AATD demographic at highest risk for AEs (especially systemic and prolonged AEs) was young females. No increase in AE risk was observed in patients with established emphysema, sonographic evidence of liver disease, or in those receiving intravenous augmentation therapy. AE incidence declined sharply following the initial vaccine series. Same-day coadministration of the COVID-19 mRNA bivalent booster vaccine and the annual influenza vaccine did not result in increased AEs compared to sequential vaccines 1 week apart. Despite their pro-inflammatory state, patients with severe AATD are not at increased risk of AEs or serious AEs compared to patients with nonhereditary COPD and patients without lung disease. Same-day coadministration of COVID-19 booster vaccines with the annual influenza vaccine is feasible, safe, and well-tolerated in this population."

    "abstract": "During the COVID-19 pandemic the number of hospital admissions due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations was significantly reduced. The reason for this decline is not fully understood. Governmental non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI's), an increase in community treated exacerbations, or healthcare avoidance by patients, are potential reasons. For the current study, the impact of Dutch governmental NPI's on the COPD exacerbations and respiratory infections rate in patients with severe alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) was analyzed. The patients participated in the NCT04204252 study, a randomized controlled trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of inhaled alpha-1 antitrypsin. Data collected in the time-period from March 2020 until February 2022 was analyzed. In this period the Dutch government imposed variable NPI's to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Patients were required to document their daily symptoms in an electronic diary. The strictness of the governmental NPI's was measured by the COVID-19 Stringency Index. 19 patients participated in this study during the analysis period. A total of 40 respiratory infections and COPD exacerbations occurred. The Spearman's correlation coefficient of the monthly average COVID-19 Stringency Index and respiratory infections and COPD exacerbations rate was -0.316 (<i>p</i> = 0.132). When months known for a low respiratory infection rate were excluded, the correlation coefficient was -0.625 (<i>p</i> = 0.010). This study showed a significant negative correlation between the COPD exacerbations and respiratory infection rate and the COVID-19 Stringency Index in patients with AATD related COPD in the autumn-winter months."

We sought to compare the risk of liver transplantation associated with hepatitis C infection with AATD heterozygotes and homozygotes and determine if SERPINA1 sequencing would identify undiagnosed AATD. We performed a retrospective cohort study in a deidentified Electronic Health Record (EHR)-linked DNA biobank with 72,027 individuals genotyped for the M, Z, and S alleles in SERPINA1. We investigated liver transplantation frequency by genotype group and compared with hepatitis C infection. We performed SERPINA1 sequencing in carriers of pathogenic AATD alleles who underwent liver transplantation. Liver transplantation was associated with the Z allele (ZZ: odds ratio [OR] = 1.31, p<2e-16; MZ: OR = 1.02, p = 1.2e-13) and with hepatitis C (OR = 1.20, p<2e-16). For liver transplantation, there was a significant interaction between genotype and hepatitis C (ZZ: interaction OR = 1.23, p = 4.7e-4; MZ: interaction OR = 1.11, p = 6.9e-13). Sequencing uncovered a second, rare, pathogenic SERPINA1 variant in six of 133 individuals with liver transplants and without hepatitis C. Liver transplantation was more common in individuals with AATD risk alleles (including heterozygotes), and AATD and hepatitis C demonstrated evidence of a gene-environment interaction in relation to liver transplantation. The current AATD screening strategy may miss diagnoses whereas SERPINA1 sequencing may increase diagnostic yield for AATD, stratify risk for liver disease, and inform clinical management for individuals with AATD risk alleles and liver disease risk factors."

    "abstract": "Genetic risk factors are major determinants of chronic liver disease (CLD) progression. Patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein 3 (PNPLA3) I148M polymorphism and alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) E342K variant, termed PiZ, are major modifiers of metabolic CLD. Both variants are known to affect metabolic CLD through increased endoplasmic reticulum stress, but their combined effect on CLD progression remains largely unknown. Here, we aimed to test our working hypothesis that their combined incidence triggers CLD disease progression. We showed that patients with PiZZ/PNPLA3 I148M from the European alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) liver consortium and the UK Biobank had a trend towards higher liver enzymes, but no increased liver fat accumulation was evident between subgroups. After generating transgenic mice that overexpress the PiZ variant and simultaneously harbor the PNPLA3 I148M knockin (designated as PiZ/PNPLA3 I148M ), we observed that animals with PiZ and PiZ/PNPLA3 I148M showed increased liver enzymes compared to controls during aging. However, no significant difference between PiZ and PiZ/PNPLA3 I148M groups was observed, with no increased liver fat accumulation over time. To further study the impact on CLD progression, a Western-styled diet was administered, which resulted in increased fat accumulation and fibrosis in PiZ and PiZ/PNPLA3 I148M livers compared to controls, but the additional presence of PNPLA3 I148M had no impact on liver phenotype. Notably, the PiZ variant protected PNPLA3 I148M mice from liver damage and obesity after Western-styled diet feeding. Our results demonstrate that the PNPLA3 polymorphism in the absence of additional metabolic risk factors is insufficient to drive the development of advanced liver disease in severe AATD."

    "abstract": "<b>Rationale:</b> Intravenous plasma-purified alpha-1 antitrypsin (IV-AAT) has been used as therapy for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) since 1987. Previous trials (RAPID and RAPID-OLE) demonstrated efficacy in preserving computed tomography of lung density but no effect on FEV<sub>1</sub>. This observational study evaluated 615 people with severe AATD from three countries with socialized health care (Ireland, Switzerland, and Austria), where access to standard medical care was equal but access to IV-AAT was not. <b>Objectives:</b> To assess the real-world longitudinal effects of IV-AAT. <b>Methods:</b> Pulmonary function and mortality data were utilized to perform longitudinal analyses on registry participants with severe AATD. <b>Measurements and Main Results:</b> IV-AAT confers a survival benefit in severe AATD (<i>P</i> < 0.001). We uncovered two distinct AATD phenotypes based on an initial respiratory diagnosis: lung index and non-lung index. Lung indexes demonstrated a more rapid FEV<sub>1</sub> decline between the ages of 20 and 50 and subsequently entered a plateau phase of minimal decline from 50 onward. Consequentially, IV-AAT had no effect on FEV<sub>1</sub> decline, except in patients with a Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) stage 2 lung index. <b>Conclusions:</b> This real-world study demonstrates a survival advantage from IV-AAT. This improved survival is largely decoupled from FEV<sub>1</sub> decline. The observation that patients with severe AATD fall into two major phenotypes has implications for clinical trial design where FEV<sub>1</sub> is a primary endpoint. Recruits into trials are typically older lung indexes entering the plateau phase and, therefore, unlikely to show spirometric benefits. IV-AAT attenuates spirometric decline in lung indexes in GOLD stage 2, a spirometric group commonly outside current IV-AAT commencement recommendations."

    "abstract": "Automated use of electronic health records may aid in decreasing the diagnostic delay for rare diseases. The phenotype risk score (PheRS) is a weighted aggregate of syndromically related phenotypes that measures the similarity between an individual's conditions and features of a disease. For some diseases, there are individuals without a diagnosis of that disease who have scores similar to diagnosed patients. These individuals may have that disease but not yet be diagnosed. We calculated the PheRS for cystic fibrosis (CF) for 965,626 subjects in the Vanderbilt University Medical Center electronic health record. Of the 400 subjects with the highest PheRS for CF, 248 (62%) had been diagnosed with CF. Twenty-six of the remaining participants, those who were alive and had DNA available in the linked DNA biobank, underwent clinical review and sequencing analysis of CFTR and SERPINA1. This uncovered a potential diagnosis for 2 subjects, 1 with CF and 1 with alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency. An additional 7 subjects had pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants, 2 in CFTR and 5 in SERPINA1. These findings may be clinically actionable for the providers caring for these patients. Importantly, this study highlights feasibility and challenges for future implications of this approach."

    "abstract": "Giant bullous emphysema is a progressive bullous disease that affects young male smokers. Bullae are unilateral and mostly present in the apical lobes. Inflammatory diseases are less common cause of underlying emphysematous deterioration of the lung than tobacco smoking or genetic conditions such as Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. The current instance, however, is relatively rare because it involved a nonsmoking 14-year-old boy who was diagnosed with asthma for 8 years, and he was taking bronchodilators inhalers during acute exacerbation of asthma; he presented to the tertiary health facility with on-and-off episodes of difficulties in breathing and chest tightness for 2 weeks despite being on maximal therapy for his asthma. He was diagnosed with bilateral large emphysematous bullae by high-resolution computed tomography scan, where staged bilateral bullectomy was performed. Thoracotomy-based bullae excision is still a feasible option for improving pulmonary function and the overall quality of life of patients with giant bullae emphysema in resource-limited settings."

We wished to determine the prevalence of bronchiectasis and patient characteristics. The first cohort of patients recruited to the EARCO (European Alpha1 Research Collaboration) International Registry data base by the end of 2021 was analysed for radiological evidence of both emphysema and bronchiectasis as well as baseline demographic features. Of the first 505 patients with the PiZZ genotype entered into the data base 418 (82.8%) had a reported CT scan. There were 77 (18.4%) with a normal scan and 38 (9.1%) with bronchiectasis alone. These 2 groups were predominantly female never smokers and had lung function in the normal range. The remaining 303 (72.5%) ZZ patients all had emphysema on the scan and 113 (27%) had additional evidence of bronchiectasis. The data indicates the bronchiectasis alone is a feature of 9.1% of patients with the PiZZ genotype of Alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency but although emphysema is the dominant lung pathology bronchiectasis is also present in 27% of emphysema cases and may require a different treatment strategy."

    "abstract": "Different mutations in the <i>SERPINA1</i> gene result in alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency and in an increased risk for the development of liver diseases. More than 90% of severe deficiency patients are homozygous for Z (Glu342Lys) mutation. This mutation causes Z-AAT polymerization and intrahepatic accumulation which can result in hepatic alterations leading to steatosis, fibrosis, cirrhosis, and/or hepatocarcinoma. We aimed to investigate lipid status in hepatocytes carrying Z and normal M alleles of the <i>SERPINA1</i> gene. Hepatic organoids were developed to investigate lipid alterations. Lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells overexpressing Z-AAT, as well as in patient-derived hepatic organoids from Pi*MZ and Pi*ZZ individuals, was evaluated by Oil-Red staining in comparison to HepG2 cells expressing M-AAT and liver organoids from Pi*MM controls. Furthermore, mass spectrometry-based lipidomics analysis and transcriptomic profiling were assessed in Pi*MZ and Pi*ZZ organoids. HepG2 cells expressing Z-AAT and liver organoids from Pi*MZ and Pi*ZZ patients showed intracellular accumulation of AAT and high numbers of lipid droplets. These latter paralleled with augmented intrahepatic lipids, and in particular altered proportion of triglycerides, cholesterol esters, and cardiolipins. According to transcriptomic analysis, Pi*ZZ organoids possess many alterations in genes and cellular processes of lipid metabolism with a specific impact on the endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, and peroxisome dysfunction. Our data reveal a relationship between intrahepatic accumulation of Z-AAT and alterations in lipid homeostasis, which implies that liver organoids provide an excellent model to study liver diseases related to the mutation of the <i>SERPINA1</i> gene."

    "abstract": "Administration of exogenous alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) is the only specific therapy for the management of pulmonary morbidity in patients with AAT deficiency. It requires weekly or biweekly intravenous infusions, which may impact patient independence and quality of life. Self-administration of AAT therapy is an alternative to reduce the burden for patients who require AAT therapy. We presented herein experts' recommendations for the implementation of a program for the self-administration of AAT. This project was conducted using a modified nominal group technique and was undertaken in two online meetings involving the participation of 25 experts: specialists in pulmonology (n=17), nurses (n=5) and hospital pharmacists (n=3). The following issues were discussed, and several recommendations were agreed upon on the following topics: a) patient profile and clinical evaluation, establishing selection criteria that should include clinical as well as social criteria; b) role of health care professionals, suggested roles for specialists in pulmonology, nurses, and hospital pharmacists; c) training by the nurse, including recommendations before initiating the training and the content of the training sessions; and d) logistic issues and follow-up, adherence, and patient support. We expect this proposal to increase awareness of this therapeutic alternative and facilitate the implementation of self-administration programs, thus contributing to optimizing the patient experience with AAT therapy. Further research on the outcomes of these programs, especially from the patient perspective, will also help to improve their design and implementation."

Data regarding the reasons for choosing their current infusion practice, problems with past infusion practices, resources required, and support services utilized were collected from February 8, 2022 through July 1, 2022. Among 5266 individuals, infusions happened at home by health care providers (60.2%), at infusion clinics (30.6%), and by self-infusion (8.1%). Self-infusion prevalence increased with time on therapy and was more prevalent in younger individuals (61.2 ± 10.5 years) compared to users of other infusion practices (64.1 ± 11.0 years), (<i>p</i><0.001). The perceived benefits of self-infusion included: (1) freedom and flexibility (77.9%), (2) ability to travel (44.5%), (3) avoidance of infusion clinics (41.8%), (4) time-savings (35.9%), (5) less absence from work (26.6%), (6) less exposure to infections (22.1%), and (7) less cost (16.4%). Self-infusion was done through permanent intravenous catheters in 41.2% and peripheral intravenous catheters in 58.3%. Self-infusers were more satisfied (93.1% \"very satisfied\") than other groups. Among individuals currently infusing with home nurses or in clinics, 21.4% would consider self-infusing in the future. Self-infusion of alpha-1 antitrypsin is feasible and associated with high satisfaction scores.

Mice with genetic ablation of <i>AAT</i> do not have emphysema at baseline but develop emphysema with injury and aging. We tested the role of the <i>CELA1</i> gene in emphysema development in this genetic model of <i>AAT</i>-deficiency following tracheal lipopolysaccharide (LPS), 10 months of cigarette smoke exposure, aging, and a low-dose tracheal porcine pancreatic elastase (LD-PPE) model we developed. In this last model, we performed proteomic analysis to understand differences in lung protein composition. We were unable to show that <i>AAT</i>-deficient mice developed more emphysema than wild type with escalating doses of LPS. In the LD-PPE model, <i>AAT-</i>deficient mice developed significant and progressive emphysema from which <i>Cela1<sup>-/-</sup></i> & <i>AAT</i>-deficient mice were protected. <i>Cela1<sup>-/-</sup></i>& <i>AAT-</i>deficient lungs had more matrix-associated proteins than <i>AAT-</i>deficientlungs but also had more leukocyte-associated proteases. With cigarette smoke exposure, <i>Cela1<sup>-/-</sup> &AAT</i>-deficient mice had more emphysema than <i>AAT-</i>deficient mice but had less myeloperoxidase activity. <i>Cela1<sup>-/-</sup>&AAT</i>-deficient mice had less age-related airspace simplification than AAT-deficient and were comparable to wild type. While CELA1 promotes inflammation-independent emphysema progression and its absence preserves the lung matrix in multiple models of AAT-deficient emphysema, for unclear reasons <i>Cela1</i> deficiency is associated with increased emphysema with cigarette smoke. While anti-CELA1 therapies could potentially be used to prevent emphysema progression in AAT deficiency after smoking cessation, an understanding of why and how cigarette smoke exacerbates emphysema in <i>Cela1</i> deficiency and whether AAT replacement therapy mitigates this effect is needed first."

Among different types of treatments for patients with colon cancer, novel protein-based therapeutic strategies are considered. To explore the effect of human plasma alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) protein in the chemically induced mouse model of colorectal cancer. BALB/c mice with azoxymethane/dextran sodium sulfate (AOM/DSS)-induced colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CAC), we intraperitoneally treated with commercial preparation of human plasma AAT (4 mg per mouse). Effects of this therapy were evaluated histologically, and by immunohistochemical and gene expression assays. When compared with non-treated controls, AOM/DSS mice receiving AAT therapy exhibited significantly longer colons, and less anal bleeding. Concurrently, AAT-treated mice had significantly fewer polyps, and lower numbers of large colon tumors. Immunohistochemical examinations of colon tissues showed significantly lower neutrophil counts, more granzyme B-positive but fewer MMP9 (gelatinase B)-positive cancer cells and lower numbers of apoptotic cells in mice receiving AAT therapy. The expression levels of IL4 were significantly higher while TNFA was slightly reduced in tumor tissues of AOM/DSS mice treated with AAT than in AOM/DSS mice. Human AAT is an acute phase protein with a broad-protease inhibitory and immunomodulatory activities used as a therapeutic for emphysema patients with inherited AAT deficiency. Our results are consistent with previous findings and support an idea that AAT alone and/or in combination with available anti-cancer therapies may represent a new personalized approach for patients with colitis-induced colon cancer."

    "abstract": "The activity of PP2A (protein phosphatase 2A), a serine-threonine phosphatase, is reduced by chronic cigarette smoke (SM) exposure and α-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency, and chemical activation of PP2A reduces the loss of lung function in SM-exposed mice. However, the previously studied PP2A-activator tricyclic sulfonamide compound DBK-1154 has low stability to oxidative metabolism, resulting in fast clearance and low systemic exposure. Here we compare the utility of a new more stable PP2A activator, ATUX-792, versus DBK-1154 for the treatment of SM-induced emphysema. ATUX-792 was also tested in human bronchial epithelial cells and a mouse model of AAT deficiency, <i>Serpina1a</i>-<i>e</i>-knockout mice. Human bronchial epithelial cells were treated with ATUX-792 or DBK-1154, and cell viability, PP2A activity, and MAP (mitogen-activated protein) kinase phosphorylation status were examined. Wild-type mice received vehicle, DBK-1154, or ATUX-792 orally in the last 2 months of 4 months of SM exposure, and 8-month-old <i>Serpina1a</i>-<i>e</i>-knockout mice received ATUX-792 daily for 4 months. Forced oscillation and expiratory measurements and histology analysis were performed. Treatment with ATUX-792 or DBK-1154 resulted in PP2A activation, reduced MAP kinase phosphorylation, immune cell infiltration, reduced airspace enlargements, and preserved lung function. Using protein arrays and multiplex assays, PP2A activation was observed to reduce AAT-deficient and SM-induced release of CXCL5, CCL17, and CXCL16 into the airways, which coincided with reduced neutrophil lung infiltration. Our study indicates that suppression of the PP2A activity in two models of emphysema could be restored by next-generation PP2A activators to impact lung function."

    "abstract": "The underdiagnosis of alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency (AATD) has been recognized for many years, yet little progress has been made in treatment of the disease. In this review, we summarize the AATD disease process as well as its diagnosis and treatment by AAT augmentation therapy. AATD is a rare autosomal disease that primarily affects the lungs and liver. AATD is associated with an increased susceptibility to developing pulmonary emphysema. The specific pharmacological treatment for AATD is intravenous administration of exogenous AAT. Augmentation therapy with AAT increases serum and pulmonary epithelial AAT levels, restores anti-elastase capacity, and decreases inflammatory mediators in the lung. Augmentation therapy reduces the loss of lung density over time, thus slowing progression of the disease. The effects of augmentation therapy on outcomes, such as frequency/duration of flare-ups, quality of life, lung function decline and mortality, are assessed. Wider testing for AATD, potentially through primary care physicians, could result in earlier treatment and better outcomes for individuals with AATD-induced lung respiratory disease."

Clinical expression of AATD, reported 60 years ago associate a severe deficiency, pulmonary emphysema and/or liver fibrosis. Pulmonary emphysema is due to the severe alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency of the ZZ homozygous status and is favored by smoking. Liver fibrosis is due to the ZZ homozygous status and is favored by obesity and excessive chronic alcohol intake, with a risk of liver cancer. Diagnosis is based on serum level and either isoelectric focusing determination of the biochemical phenotype or PCR detection of some variants. SERPINA1 gene sequencing is necessary in case of discrepancies between the results of these tests. No treatment is available for the liver disease in AATD. Although no specific trial has been performed, COPD in AATD should be treated as per COPD recommendations. Based on a randomized clinical trial, augmentation therapy is indicated in non-smoking adults less than 70 years of age with emphysema at chest CT, confirmed homozygous AATD, and FEV1 between 35% and 70% of predicted. In contrast Z heterozygosis (MZ or SZ) brings a risk of lung or liver disease only in association with further risk factors. Early detection, in all patients with COPD and chronic liver disease, is critical for the correct information of Z variant carriers. News ways of correcting the liver production of alpha1-antitrypsin will modify the care of AATD patients."

Blood biomarkers are an attractive method of monitoring diseases as they are easy to obtain and repeatable. In non-AATD COPD, blood biomarker panels have predicted disease severity, progression, and mortality. We measured a panel of seven serum biomarkers in 200 AATD patients and compared levels between those with COPD and those without. We assessed whether biomarkers were associated with baseline lung function parameters (FEV1 and TLco) or absolute change in these parameters. In total, 111 patients with a severely deficient genotype of AATD (PiZZ) and COPD were included in the analyses. Pearson's correlation coefficient was measured for biomarker correlations and models were compared using ANOVA. CRP and CCL18 were significantly higher in the serum of AATD COPD versus AATD with no COPD. Biomarkers were not predictive of cross-sectional lung function measurements, however, CC16 was significantly associated with an absolute change in TLco (<i>p</i> = 0.018). An addition of biomarkers to the predictive model for TLco added significant value over covariates alone (R<sup>2</sup> 0.13 vs. 0.02, <i>p</i> = 0.028). Our findings suggest that CC16 is predictive of emphysema progression in AATD COPD. Proteomics data may reveal alternative candidate biomarkers and further work should include the use of longitudinal biomarker measurements."

This article describes the role of misfolded proteins and protein aggregates in disease and options for therapeutic approaches. The RNAi mechanism is discussed, along with how the siRNA therapeutic fazirsiran for the treatment of AATD was developed. We also describe the implications of siRNA therapeutics in extrahepatic diseases. Using RNAi as a therapeutic approach is well suited to treat disease in conditions where an excess of a protein or the effect of an abnormal mutated protein causes disease. The results observed for the first few siRNA therapeutics that were approved or are in development provide an important promise for the development of future drugs that can address such conditions in a specific and targeted way. Current developments should enable the use of RNAi therapeutics outside the liver, where there are many more possible diseases to address."

Alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT), a well-characterized inhibitor of neutrophil serine protease, is used in augmentation therapy to treat emphysema due to severe AAT deficiency. Evidence demonstrates its additional anti-inflammatory and tissue-protective effects. We hypothesized that adding human AAT in a preservation solution reduces graft dysfunction in a rat model of HTX following extended cold ischemic storage. The hearts from isogenic Lewis donor rats were explanted, stored for either 1h or 5h in cold Custodiol supplemented with either vehicle (1h ischemia, n=7 or 5h ischemia, n=7 groups) or 1 mg/ml AAT (1h ischemia+AAT, n=7 or 5h ischemia+AAT, n=9 groups) before heterotopic HTX. Left-ventricular (LV) graft function was evaluated <i>in vivo</i> 1.5h after HTX. Immunohistochemical detection of myeloperoxydase (MPO) was performed in myocardial tissue and expression of 88 gene quantified with PCR was analyzed both statistical and with machine-learning methods. After HTX, LV systolic function (dP/dt<sub>max</sub> 1h ischemia+AAT 4197 ± 256 vs 1h ischemia 3123 ± 110; 5h ischemia+AAT 2858 ± 154 vs 5h ischemia 1843 ± 104mmHg/s, <i>p</i><0.05) and diastolic function (dP/dt<sub>min</sub> 5h ischemia+AAT 1516 ± 68 vs 5h ischemia 1095 ± 67mmHg/s, <i>p</i><0.05) at an intraventricular volume of 90µl were improved in the AAT groups compared with the corresponding vehicle groups.

Moreover, the 5h ischemia+AAT hearts exhibited a significant reduction in MPO-positive cell infiltration in comparison to the 5h ischemia group. Our computational analysis shows that ischemia+AAT network displays higher homogeneity, more positive and fewer negative gene correlations than the ischemia+placebo network. We provided experimental evidence that AAT protects cardiac grafts from prolonged cold ischemia during HTX in rats."

In intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA), the abundance of A1AT protein was increased in the tumor and appeared to be influenced by the genomic alterations. On the one hand, BTC with A1ATD had lower perineural invasion at histopathology and displayed a longer survival, suggesting that a deficiency in this protein is associated with a less aggressive phenotype. On the other hand, iCCA with high A1AT expression had more advanced tumor staging and enriched pathways for complement system and extracellular matrix interactions, indicating that A1AT protein might contribute to a more aggressive phenotype. With increased awareness, screening, and basic studies, A1ATD could represent one more layer of stratification for future targeted therapies in BTC."

Responses from 8019 individuals were analyzed to evaluate the prevalence and severity of COVID-19 infections, interruptions in AATD care, and the likelihood of vaccination. By the end of 2020, 4% of patients reported a positive COVID-19 test. Of those, 35.3% were hospitalized, with 8.6% admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). By February 2022, the prevalence of COVID-19 infections had increased to 18.6%, with hospitalization rates of 22.1% and ICU admissions at 4.7%. Attitudes about COVID-19 vaccination assessed in December 2020 before the vaccine was widely available suggested 10.3% of patients would <i>definitely not</i> get the vaccine. Notably, 38.2% of those subsequently self-reported receipt of a COVID-19 vaccine. The prevalence of COVID-19 infections in patients with AATD was lower than the prevalence in the general U.S. population during 2020, although with a higher hospitalization rate. This health-managed population has a high vaccination intent. Those with an initially low vaccination intent changed their minds over time.

    "abstract": "Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency is a genetic disorder that leads to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lower circulating levels of AAT, which is a protease inhibitor with potent anti-inflammatory effects. In order to better understand the presence of systemic inflammation in AAT-deficient individuals with COPD, we investigatedthe plasma levels of C-reactive protein (CRP). AAT-deficient individuals and a matched cohort with a normal AAT genotype were recruited from the Alpha-1 Foundation DNA and Tissue Bank. AAT genotypes were determined by a combination of a Taqman-based assay. AAT and CRP levels were determined by nephelometry. Comparisons were determined by unpaired <i>t</i>-test and standard Pearson's correlation. Our study included 40 control participants and 742 AAT-deficient participants, of which 498 received augmentation therapy. In the AAT-deficient participants, the plasma AAT was 20.2±11.6µM and 4.5±1.3µM (<i>P</i><0.0001) with and without augmentation therapy, respectively, and the CRP was 0.32±0.53mg/dL and 0.69±1.97mg/dL (<i>P</i>=0.0169), respectively. There was a negative correlation between the percentage predicted of forced expiratory volume in 1 second and CRP in the group not receiving augmentation therapy (r=-0.2528, <i>P</i><0.05), and there was no correlation in participants receiving augmentation therapy. Compared to healthy individuals, AAT-deficient individuals with COPD have higher levels of circulating CRP, suggesting increased systemic inflammation. However, AAT-deficient individuals receiving augmentation therapy had lower plasma CRP levels compared to those who are not."

    "title": "A novel endoplasmic reticulum adaptation is critical for the long-lived Caenorhabditis elegans rpn-10 proteasomal mutant.",
    "abstract": "The loss of proteostasis due to reduced efficiency of protein degradation pathways plays a key role in multiple age-related diseases and is a hallmark of the aging process. Paradoxically, we have previously reported that the Caenorhabditis elegans rpn-10(ok1865) mutant, which lacks the RPN-10/RPN10/PSMD4 subunit of the 19S regulatory particle of the 26S proteasome, exhibits enhanced cytosolic proteostasis, elevated stress resistance and extended lifespan, despite possessing reduced proteasome function. However, the response of this mutant against threats to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis and proteostasis was unknown. Here, we find that the rpn-10 mutant is highly ER stress resistant compared to the wildtype. Under unstressed conditions, the ER unfolded protein response (UPR) is activated in the rpn-10 mutant as signified by increased xbp-1 splicing. This primed response appears to alter ER homeostasis through the upregulated expression of genes involved in ER protein quality control (ERQC), including those in the ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD) pathway. Pertinently, we find that ERQC is critical for the rpn-10 mutant longevity. These changes also alter ER proteostasis, as studied using the C. elegans alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency model, which comprises an intestinal ER-localised transgenic reporter of an aggregation-prone form of AAT called ATZ. The rpn-10 mutant shows a significant reduction in the accumulation of the ATZ reporter, thus indicating that its ER proteostasis is augmented. Via a genetic screen for suppressors of decreased ATZ aggregation in the rpn-10 mutant, we then identified ecps-2/H04D03.3, a novel ortholog of the proteasome-associated adaptor and scaffold protein ECM29/ECPAS. We further show that ecps-2 is required for improved ER proteostasis as well as lifespan extension of the rpn-10 mutant. Thus, we propose that ECPS-2-proteasome functional interactions, alongside additional putative molecular processes, contribute to a novel ERQC adaptation which underlies the superior proteostasis and longevity of the rpn-10 mutant."

    "abstract": "Pharmacotherapies and avoidance of environmental/inhaled toxins are core to managing COPD. Compared to the drugs available 50 years ago, there has been substantial progress with COPD pharmacotherapies, but gaps in adherence and inhaler use persist. Personalizing inhaled pharmacotherapies is now possible with digital technologies by objectively documenting adherence and guiding inhaler technique. Another means to improve existing pharmacotherapies is through phenotyping and biomarkers. This is especially important considering the heterogeneity of the disease COPD. Blood eosinophils are now a recommended biomarker to guide use of inhaled corticosteroids and biologics in COPD. On the near horizon, we will see new inhaled medications as dual phosphodiesterase inhibitors, drugs to treat basic protein abnormalities as in alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency that could have remarkable benefits, and biologic drugs targeting specific cell/mediator types in the COPD population. Characterization of COPD phenotypes, as asthma/COPD overlap and comorbid heart disease are vital to understand how to optimize pharmacotherapies. Importantly, we must determine how to optimize current medications; otherwise, we will repeat the same mistakes with new medications. But as we know so well, as we peel one layer of complexity, we encounter many more questions, all the while dedicated to limiting the burden of COPD."

Physical activity (PA) is important for the prevention and treatment of chronic disease. Little is known about PA in people with AATD. Therefore, we aimed to map the research undertaken to improve and/or measure PA, sedentary behaviour (SB) or exercise in people with AATD. Searches were conducted in CINAHL, Medline, EMBASE and clinical trial databases for studies published in 2021. Databases were searched for keywords (physical activity, AATD, exercise, sedentary behavior) as well as synonyms of these terms, which were connected using Boolean operators. The search yielded 360 records; 37 records were included for review. All included studies (n = 37) assessed exercise capacity; 22 studies reported the use of the six-minute walk test, the incremental shuttle walk test and cardiopulmonary exercise testing were reported in three studies each. Other objective measures of exercise capacity included a submaximal treadmill test, the Naughton protocol treadmill test, cycle ergometer maximal test, endurance shuttle walk test, constant cycle work rate test, a peak work rate test and the number of flights of stairs a participant was able to walk without stopping. A number of participant self-reported measures of exercise capacity were noted. Only one study aimed to analyze the effects of an intensive fitness intervention on daily PA. One further study reported on an exercise intervention and objectively measured PA at baseline. No studies measured SB. The assessment of PA and use of PA as an intervention in AATD is limited, and research into SB absent. Future research should measure PA and SB levels in people with AATD and explore interventions to enhance PA in this susceptible population."

    "abstract": "Alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a genetic risk factor for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Whilst testing for the condition is relatively simple, there is a disconnect in published literature between genetic epidemiology and numbers of patients known to specialists. This makes planning services for patients difficult. We aimed to estimate the number of patients likely to have lung disease eligible for specific AATD therapy within the UK. The THIN database was used to determine the prevalence of AATD and symptomatic COPD. This, and published rates of AATD were used to extrapolate THIN data to the population size of the UK to give an indicative population size for symptomatic AATD patients who have lung disease. The Birmingham AATD registry was used to describe age at diagnosis, rate of lung disease and symptomatic lung disease for patients with PiZZ (or equivalent) AATD, together with the time from symptom onset to diagnosis, in order to aid interpretation of the THIN data and improve modeling. THIN data showed COPD prevalence of 3%, and AATD prevalence of 0.005-0.2%, depending on how stringently AATD diagnostic codes were applied. The majority of Birmingham AATD patients were diagnosed between the ages 46-55, whilst patients recorded in THIN tended to be older. The rate of COPD was similar in the THIN and Birmingham patients diagnosed with AATD. Modelling to the size of the UK demonstrated a likely symptomatic AATD population of between 3016 and 9866 people. AATD is likely to be under-diagnosed in the UK. Based on projected patient numbers an expansion to specialist services is desirable, in particular if specific therapy for AATD such as augmentation were to be introduced to the healthcare system."

The aim of the present study was to characterise any relationship between alveolar haemorrhage and human AAT deficiency (AATD) using bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and lung explant samples from AATD subjects. BAL samples (17 patients, 15 controls) were evaluated for free haem (iron protoporphyrin IX) and total iron concentrations. Alveolar macrophage activation patterns were assessed using RNA sequencing and validated <i>in vitro</i> using haem-stimulated, monocyte-derived macrophages. Lung explants (seven patients, four controls) were assessed for iron sequestration protein expression patterns using Prussian blue stain and ferritin immunohistochemistry, as well as ferritin iron imaging and elemental analysis by transmission electron microscopy. Tissue oxidative damage was assessed using 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine immunohistochemistry. BAL collected from AATD patients showed significantly elevated free haem and total iron concentrations. Alveolar and interstitial macrophages in AATD explants showed elevated iron and ferritin accumulation in large lysosomes packed by iron oxide cores with degraded ferritin protein cages. BAL macrophage RNA sequencing showed innate pro-inflammatory activation, replicated <i>in vitro</i> by haemin exposure, which also triggered reactive oxygen species generation. AATD explants showed massive oxidative DNA damage in both lung epithelial cells and macrophages. BAL and tissue markers of alveolar haemorrhage, together with molecular and cellular evidence of macrophage innate pro-inflammatory activation and oxidative damage, are consistent with free haem stimulation. Overall, this initial study provides evidence for a pathogenetic role of elastase-induced alveolar haemorrhage in AATD emphysema."

Herein, we reviewed the epidemiologic evidence, the molecular mechanisms, and the clinical evidence that support this paradigm. As background to our discussion, we first examined the basic mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 infection and contend that despite the availability of vaccines and anti-viral agents, COVID-19 remains problematic due to viral evolution. We next underscored that measures to prevent severe COVID-19 currently exists but teeters on a balance and that current treatment for severe COVID-19 remains grossly suboptimal. We then reviewed the epidemiologic and clinical evidence that AAT deficiency increases risk of COVID-19 infection and of more severe disease, and the experimental evidence that AAT inhibits cell surface transmembrane protease 2 (TMPRSS2) - a host serine protease required for SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells - and that this inhibition may be augmented by heparin. We also elaborated on the panoply of other activities of AAT (and heparin) that could mitigate severity of COVID-19. Finally, we evaluated the available clinical evidence for AAT treatment of COVID-19."

The present study aims to assess the frequencies of rare and null alleles and their respiratory and hepatic pathogenicity. This is a secondary analysis of a study that evaluated the viability of the Progenika diagnostic genotyping system in six different countries by analyzing 30,827 samples from cases of suspected AATD. Allele-specific genotyping was carried out with the Progenika A1AT Genotyping Test which analyses 14 mutations in buccal swabs or dried blood spots samples. SERPINA1 gene sequencing was performed for serum AAT-genotype discrepancies or by request of the clinician. Only cases with rare mutations were included in this analysis. There were 818 cases (2.6%) carrying a rare allele, excluding newly identified mutations. All were heterozygous except for 20 that were homozygous. The most frequent alleles were the M-like alleles, PI*M<sub>malton</sub> and PI*M<sub>heerlen</sub>. Of the 14 mutations included in the Progenika panel, there were no cases detected of PI*S<sub>iiyama</sub>, PI*Q0<sub>granite falls</sub> and PI*Q0<sub>west</sub>. Other alleles not included in the 14-mutation panel and identified by gene sequencing included PI*M<sub>würzburg</sub>, PI*Z<sub>bristol</sub>, and PI*Z<sub>wrexham</sub>, and the null alleles PI*Q0<sub>porto</sub>, PI*Q0<sub>madrid</sub>, PI*Q0<sub>brescia</sub>, and PI*Q0<sub>kayseri</sub>. The Progenika diagnostic network has allowed the identification of several rare alleles, some unexpected and not included in the initial diagnostic panel. This establishes a new perspective on the distribution of these alleles in different countries. These findings may help prioritize allele selection for routine testing and highlights the need for further research into their pathogenetic role."

Asthma patients may experience potentially life-threatening episodic flare-ups, known as exacerbations, which may significantly contribute to the asthma burden. The <i>Pi*S</i> and <i>Pi*Z</i> variants of the <i>SERPINA1</i> gene, which usually involve alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency, had previously been associated with asthma. The link between AAT deficiency and asthma might be represented by the elastase/antielastase imbalance. However, their role in asthma exacerbations remains unknown. Our objective was to assess whether <i>SERPINA1</i> genetic variants and reduced AAT protein levels are associated with asthma exacerbations. In the discovery analysis, <i>SERPINA1 Pi*S</i> and <i>Pi*Z</i> variants and serum AAT levels were analyzed in 369 subjects from La Palma (Canary Islands, Spain). As replication, genomic data from two studies focused on 525 Spaniards and publicly available data from UK Biobank, FinnGen, and GWAS Catalog (<i>Open Targets Genetics</i>) were analyzed. The associations between <i>SERPINA1 Pi*S</i> and <i>Pi*Z</i> variants and AAT deficiency with asthma exacerbations were analyzed with logistic regression models, including age, sex, and genotype principal components as covariates. In the discovery, a significant association with asthma exacerbations was found for both <i>Pi*S</i> (odds ratio [OR]=2.38, 95% confidence interval [CI]= 1.40-4.04, <i>p</i>-value=0.001) and <i>Pi*Z</i> (OR=3.49, 95%CI=1.55-7.85, <i>p</i>-value=0.003)Likewise, AAT deficiency was associated with a higher risk for asthma exacerbations (OR=5.18, 95%CI=1.58-16.92, <i>p</i>-value=0.007) as well as AAT protein levels (OR= 0.72, 95%CI=0.57-0.91, <i>p</i>-value=0.005).

    "abstract": "Fibrosis, or tissue scarring, develops as a pathological deviation from the physiological wound healing response and can occur in various organs such as the heart, lung, liver, kidney, skin, and bone marrow. Organ fibrosis significantly contributes to global morbidity and mortality. A broad spectrum of etiologies can cause fibrosis, including acute and chronic ischemia, hypertension, chronic viral infection (e.g., viral hepatitis), environmental exposure (e.g., pneumoconiosis, alcohol, nutrition, smoking) and genetic diseases (e.g., cystic fibrosis, alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency). Common mechanisms across organs and disease etiologies involve a sustained injury to parenchymal cells that triggers a wound healing response, which becomes deregulated in the disease process. A transformation of resting fibroblasts into myofibroblasts with excessive extracellular matrix production constitutes the hallmark of disease, however, multiple other cell types such as immune cells, predominantly monocytes/macrophages, endothelial cells, and parenchymal cells form a complex network of profibrotic cellular crosstalk. Across organs, leading mediators include growth factors like transforming growth factor-β and platelet-derived growth factor, cytokines like interleukin-10, interleukin-13, interleukin-17, and danger-associated molecular patterns. More recently, insights into fibrosis regression and resolution of chronic conditions have deepened our understanding of beneficial, protective effects of immune cells, soluble mediators and intracellular signaling. Further in-depth insights into the mechanisms of fibrogenesis can provide the rationale for therapeutic interventions and the development of targeted antifibrotic agents. This review gives insight into shared responses and cellular mechanisms across organs and etiologies, aiming to paint a comprehensive picture of fibrotic diseases in both experimental settings and in human pathology."

In this case report, we present a patient with SARS-CoV-2 whose liver enzymes remained persistently elevated throughout his hospitalization. Due to the duration of his elevated liver enzymes, etiologies outside of SARS-CoV-2 were explored. This workup revealed that the patient had alpha-1 antitrypsin (A1AT) deficiency.

Because symptoms of AATD overlap with those of common pulmonary and hepatic conditions, AATD is often misdiagnosed, which has resulted in substantial underdiagnosis of AATD worldwide. Although screening patients for AATD is recommended, the lack of procedures to facilitate testing remains a barrier to accurate diagnosis of AATD. Delays in AATD diagnosis can worsen outcomes for patients by postponing appropriate disease-modifying treatments. Patients with AATD-related lung disease experience symptoms similar to other obstructive lung disorders and are often misdiagnosed for years. In addition to existing screening guidelines, we recommend that screening for AATD become a standard part of allergists' workups of patients with asthma and fixed obstructive disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bronchiectasis without known origin, and patients under consideration for treatment with biologics. This Rostrum article reviews screening and diagnostic tests available in the United States and emphasizes evidence-based strategies to increase testing frequency and improve AATD detection rates. We underscore the pivotal role of allergists in managing care for patients with AATD.

Excessive hepatic accumulation of these abnormal molecules can lead to liver disease in both adults and children, with clinical presentation ranging from cholestatic jaundice in the newborn to abnormal blood indices of liver function in children and adults, up to fatty liver, cirrhosis and hepatocarcinoma. Nutritional interventions in AATD aim to provide the necessary calories, stop protein catabolism, prevent and treat malnutrition as in the case of common COPD, and even take into account any liver disease that is a distinctive trait, compared to common COPD. Actually, there is a lack of formal research regarding the effects of specific nutritional recommendations in patients with AATD, proper eating habits may help to preserve lung and liver function. For practical dietary advice in patients with AATD and COPD, recently a food pyramid proposal has been published. It has been observed that there is a marked overlap between AATD liver disease and obesity-related liver disease, suggesting shared molecular basis and, therefore, similar nutritional strategies. In this narrative review dietary advice for all possible stages of liver disease have been reported."

    "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a primary liver malignancy known to occur majorly in patients with liver cirrhosis or those with a harbinger of risk factors like viral hepatitis, autoimmune liver disease, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, alcoholic liver disease, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. The incidence of HCC has risen in the past 2 decades and currently ranks as the sixth most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Most cases are seen in adulthood, and only a very small percentage have been reported in adolescents with risk factors. The 2 pathologic subtypes of pediatric HCC are classic and fibrolamellar. Here, we discussed a very interesting rare case of a healthy male teenager with no apparent liver disease or risk factor who presented with right-upper-quadrant pain, normal alpha-fetoprotein level, and abdominal ultrasound showing a large hepatic mass. A liver biopsy was positive for HCC with fluorescent in situ hybridization showing a PRKACA complex gene pattern, favoring the fibrolamellar type."

    "abstract": "Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a neutrophilic inflammatory disorder that may result in local hypoxia, reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) production, and increased damage in adjacent tissues. This study aims to determine the impact of hypoxia on neutrophil oxidative stress profile in AATD patients. Neutrophils were isolated from AATD patients and control volunteers and exposed to hypoxia (1% O<sub>2</sub> for 4 h), ROS/RNS, mitochondrial parameters, and non-enzymatic antioxidant defenses measured by flow cytometry. The expression of enzymatic antioxidant defenses was determined by qRT-PCR. Our results indicate that ZZ-AATD neutrophils produce higher amounts of hydrogen peroxide, peroxynitrite, and nitric oxide and decreased levels of the antioxidant enzymes catalase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione reductase. Likewise, our results show a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential, indicating that this organelle could be involved in the production of the reactive species observed. No decrease in glutathione and thiol levels were observed. The accumulation of substances with high oxidative capacity would explain the greater oxidative damage observed in proteins and lipids. In conclusion, our results indicate that, compared to MM control individuals, ZZ-AATD neutrophils show increased ROS/RNS production under hypoxic conditions opening a new rationale for using antioxidant therapies to treat the disease."

    "abstract": "The nebulization of alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) for its administration to the lung could be an interesting alternative to parenteral infusion for patients suffering from AAT genetic deficiency (AATD). In the case of protein therapeutics, the effect of the nebulization mode and rate on protein conformation and activity must be carefully considered. In this paper two types of nebulizers, i.e., a jet and a mesh vibrating system, were used to nebulize a commercial preparation of AAT for infusion and compared. The aerosolization performance, in terms of mass distribution, respirable fraction, and drug delivery efficiency, as well as the activity and aggregation state of AAT upon in vitro nebulization were investigated. The two nebulizers demonstrated equivalent aerosolization performances, but the mesh nebulizer provided a higher efficiency in the delivery of the dose. The activity of the protein was acceptably preserved by both nebulizers and no aggregation or changes in its conformation were identified. This suggests that nebulization of AAT represents a suitable administration strategy ready to be translated to the clinical practice for delivering the protein directly to the lungs in AATD patients, either as a support therapy to parenteral administration or for subjects with a precocious diagnosis, to prevent the onset of pulmonary symptoms."

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the prevalence of significant fibrosis and advanced fibrosis in AAT deficiency based on non-invasive imaging. Medline and Embase electronic databases were searched for studies from inception to 13 November 2022 that provided data for the prevalence of fibrosis in adults with AAT deficiency. A generalised linear mixed model with Clopper-Pearson intervals was used to pool single-arm outcomes. Of the 214 records identified, 8 studies were included. Five studies assessed fibrosis using vibration-controlled transient elastography. The prevalence of significant fibrosis (defined as ≥7.1 kPA) in Z homozygosity, Z heterozygosity and non-carrier status was 22.10% (five studies, 95% CI: 17.07-28.12), 9.24% (three studies, 95% CI: 4.68-17.45) and 5.38% (one study, 95% CI: 3.27-8.73), respectively, p < 0.0001, and the prevalence of advanced fibrosis (defined as ≥9.5 kPa) was 8.13% (five studies, 95% CI: 4.60-13.96), 2.96% (three studies, 95% CI: 1.49-5.81) and 1.08% (one study, 95% CI: 0.35-3.28), respectively, p = 0.003. There were limited data regarding the use of magnetic resonance elastography or acoustic radiation force impulse to assess for fibrosis. More than one in five adult individuals with AAT deficiency and Z homozygosity harbour significant fibrosis, and nearly 1 in 10 harbours advanced fibrosis. The risk of fibrosis increases incrementally with the frequency of Pi*Z mutations."

    "abstract": "SERPINA1 is a well-studied serpin gene due to its dramatic impact on human health. Translation initiation at the main SERPINA1 start codon produces the only known alpha1-antitrypsin (AAT) isoform intended for secretion. AAT performs essential functions by inhibiting proteases and modulating immunity. However, SERPINA1 expression at the level of translation is not sufficiently studied. Here we hypothesize that the main SERPINA1 ORF can be alternatively translated, producing a non-secretory AAT isoform by either masking or excluding a signal peptide. We defined SERPINA1 long mRNA isoforms specific for prostate (DU145) and liver (HepG2) cell lines and studied their individual expression by in vitro assay. We found that all long transcripts produce both glycosylated secretory AAT-eGFP fusion protein and non-glycosylated intracellular AAT-eGFP (initiated from an alternative AUG-2 start codon), with the proportion regulated by the SERPINA1 5'-UTR. Both fusion proteins localize to distinct cellular compartments: in contrast to a fusion with the secretory AAT accumulating in the ER, the intracellular one exhibits nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling. We detected putative endogenous AAT isoform enriching the nuclear speckles. CONCLUSION: Alternative translation initiation might be a mechanism through which SERPINA1 expands the biological diversity of its protein products. Our findings open up new prospects for the study of SERPINA1 gene expression."

    "abstract": "Giant bullous emphysema, also known as \"vanishing lung syndrome\", is a rare manifestation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) that is associated with high mortality. Cigarette smoking and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (A1AD) are two main causes that result in permanent enlargement of airspaces, inefficient gas exchange, fibrosis of the airways, and collapse of the alveoli. A typical presentation can be found in a long-term smoker with dyspnea on exertion and progressive shortness of breath that may be associated with a productive cough. One of the clinical difficulties in diagnosing giant bullous emphysema is separating it from other etiologies like pneumothorax. It is paramount to differentiate giant bullous emphysema from pneumothorax as the management is completely different; both can, however, have similar clinical presentations and radiographic manifestations on initial assessment. In this report, we present the case of a 39-year-old African American male who presented with worsening shortness of breath and productive cough and was found to have bullous emphysema but was misdiagnosed and treated for pneumothorax in the initial encounter. The purpose of this case report is to raise awareness of this condition in the medical literature and discuss the similarity of bullous emphysema and pneumothorax in clinical presentation and radiographic findings, as well as the differences in treatment options."

    "title": "A robust reprogramming strategy for generating hepatocyte-like cells usable in pharmaco-toxicological studies.",
    "abstract": "High-throughput pharmaco-toxicological testing frequently relies on the use of established liver-derived cell lines, such as HepG2 cells. However, these cells often display limited hepatic phenotype and features of neoplastic transformation that may bias the interpretation of the results. Alternate models based on primary cultures or differentiated pluripotent stem cells are costly to handle and difficult to implement in high-throughput screening platforms. Thus, cells without malignant traits, optimal differentiation pattern, producible in large and homogeneous amounts and with patient-specific phenotypes would be desirable. We have designed and implemented a novel and robust approach to obtain hepatocytes from individuals by direct reprogramming, which is based on a combination of a single doxycycline-inducible polycistronic vector system expressing HNF4A, HNF1A and FOXA3, introduced in human fibroblasts previously transduced with human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT). These cells can be maintained in fibroblast culture media, under standard cell culture conditions. Clonal hTERT-transduced human fibroblast cell lines can be expanded at least to 110 population doublings without signs of transformation or senescence. They can be easily differentiated at any cell passage number to hepatocyte-like cells with the simple addition of doxycycline to culture media. Acquisition of a hepatocyte phenotype is achieved in just 10 days and requires a simple and non-expensive cell culture media and standard 2D culture conditions. Hepatocytes reprogrammed from low and high passage hTERT-transduced fibroblasts display very similar transcriptomic profiles, biotransformation activities and show analogous pattern behavior in toxicometabolomic studies. Results indicate that this cell model outperforms HepG2 in toxicological screening. The procedure also allows generation of hepatocyte-like cells from patients with given pathological phenotypes. In fact, we succeeded in generating hepatocyte-like cells from a patient with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, which recapitulated accumulation of intracellular alpha-1 antitrypsin polymers and deregulation of unfolded protein response and inflammatory networks. Our strategy allows the generation of an unlimited source of clonal, homogeneous, non-transformed induced hepatocyte-like cells, capable of performing typical hepatic functions and suitable for pharmaco-toxicological high-throughput testing. Moreover, as far as hepatocyte-like cells derived from fibroblasts isolated from patients suffering hepatic dysfunctions, retain the disease traits, as demonstrated for alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, this strategy can be applied to the study of other cases of anomalous hepatocyte functionality."

    "abstract": "Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is an underdiagnosed disorder associated with mutations in the <i>SERPINA1</i> gene encoding alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT). Severe AATD can manifest as pulmonary emphysema and progressive liver disease. Besides the most common pathogenic variants S (E264V) and Z (E342K), many rarer genetic variants of AAT have been found in patients and in the general population. Here we report a panel of new <i>SERPINA1</i> variants, including 4 null and 16 missense alleles, identified among a cohort of individuals with suspected AATD whose phenotypic follow-up showed inconclusive or atypical results. Because the pathogenic significance of the missense variants was unclear purely on the basis of clinical data, the integration of computational, biochemical, and cellular studies was used to define the associated risk of disease. Established pathogenicity predictors and structural analysis identified a panel of candidate damaging mutations that were characterized by expression in mammalian cell models. Polymer formation, intracellular accumulation, and secretory efficiency were evaluated experimentally. Our results identified two AAT mutants with a Z-like polymerogenic severe deficiency profile (S<sub><i>milano</i></sub> and M<sub><i>campolongo</i></sub>) and three milder variants (X<sub><i>sarezzo</i></sub>, P<sub><i>dublin</i></sub>, and C<sub><i>tiberias</i></sub>). Overall, the experimentally determined behavior of the variants was in agreement with the pathogenicity scores of the REVEL (an ensemble method for predicting the pathogenicity of rare missense variants) predictor, supporting the utility of this bioinformatic tool in the initial assessment of newly identified amino acid substitutions of AAT. Our study, in addition to describing 20 new <i>SERPINA1</i> variants, provides a model for a multidisciplinary approach to classification of rare AAT variants and their clinical impact on individuals with rare AATD genotypes."

A systematic review of the literature was conducted for studies investigating the prevalence of COPD and the prevalence of severe alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) PI*ZZ genotype. Results are shown in tables and on a whole world interpolation map. Studies from 48 countries with available data (21 from Europe, 9 from the Americas, 5 from Africa, 11 from Asia and 2 from Australasia) were selected. About 235,000 individuals with PI*ZZ genotypes were accounted: 50% in Europe, 37% in America, 9% in Asia, 3% in Australasia and 1% in Africa. The estimated crude prevalence of COPD in adults older than 40 years was 12.45% in Europe, 13.51% in America, 13.22% in Africa, 11.70% in Asia and 11.86% in Australasia. The highest PI*ZZ weighted average prevalence among COPD subjects (expressed as 1/x [95% confidence intervals]) were found in Northern Europe (395 [252-576]) followed by Western (797 [538-1165]), Southern (944 [600-1475]) and Central Europe (1096 [687-1738]).

In the rest of the world, prevalence was significantly lower, especially in vast regions of Asia and Africa where the PI*Z gene is practically non-existent. Severe AATD is associated with a significant number of cases of COPD, especially in Europe, USA, Canada, New Zealand and Australia."

The risk of lung disease in those with intermediate AAT deficiency is unclear. Our aims were to compare pulmonary function, time of onset of symptoms, and indicators of quality of life among patients with severe AATD (PI*ZZ), patients with intermediate AATD (PI*MZ) from the Italian Registry of AATD with a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) cohort of patients without AATD (PI*MM). We considered a total of 613 patients: 330 with the PI*ZZ genotype, 183 with the PI*MZ genotype and 100 with the PI*MM genotype. Radiological exams, pulmonary function test, and measurement of quality of life have been performed on all cohorts of patients. The three populations differ significantly in terms of age at COPD/AATD diagnosis (P=0.00001), respiratory function (FEV1, FVC, DLCO P<0.001), quality of life (P=0.0001) and smoking history (P<0.0001). PI*ZZ genotype had 24.9 times a higher likelihood of developing airflow obstruction. The MZ genotype is not associated with a significant early risk of airflow obstruction. The comparison of populations with PI*ZZ, MZ and MM genotypes allows to delineate the role of alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency on respiratory function and on the impact on quality of life, in relation to other risk factors. These results highlight the crucial role of primary and secondary prevention on smoking habits in PI*MZ subjects and the importance of an early diagnosis."

Wider screening of COPD patients for AATD could lead to faster diagnosis and earlier treatment of AATD patients with AATD which could slow or prevent progression of their disease."

For this pathological condition, unimpeded neutrophil elastase activity has been ascribed a pivotal role in the destruction of lung tissue and thus in disease progression. Therefore, low, or non-quantifiable neutrophil elastase (NE) activity levels determined in bronchoalveolar lavage solutions indicate the success of α<sub>1</sub>-antitrypsin (AAT) augmentation therapy as NE activity will be erased. To overcome the known limitations of available elastase activity assays regarding sensitivity and selectivity, we developed a new elastase activity assay, which fundamentally relies on the highly specific complex formation between AAT and active elastase. Plate-bound AAT captured active elastase from the sample undergoing complex formation, followed by the immunological detection of human NE. This assay principle facilitated the measurement of low pM amounts of active human NE. The data of the assay performance check demonstrated adequate accuracy and precision profiles meeting currently accepted best practices for this activity assay, which can be classified as a ligand-binding assay. Furthermore, spike-recovery studies at low human NE levels, carried out for three human bronchoalveolar samples, resulted in recoveries within the 100 ± 20% range, while good linearity and parallelism of the samples' dilution-response curves was observed. Altogether, complemented by the data of selectivity and robustness studies and the accuracy and precision profile obtained in buffer, this newly developed human NE activity assay was demonstrated to perform accurately and precisely in clinically relevant samples."

This is in part due to the underdiagnosis and lack of confirmation of COPD but also from poor adherence to AATD screening recommendations. <b>Objectives:</b> A clinical decision support system (CDSS) to guide primary care providers improves spirometry testing and confirmation of COPD diagnosis in subjects at risk and improves AATD screening in patients with confirmed COPD. <b>Methods:</b> A CDSS was created to be applied to all Veterans attending single-center Veterans Affairs primary care clinics. The CDSS had an algorithmic dialogue with components executed in phases during different clinic visits: screening for COPD risk using the COPD population screening (COPD-PS) questionnaire, spirometry recommendation, and ordering tool for subjects with a prior diagnosis of COPD or subjects considered high risk by the COPD-PS, dialogue to confirm or discard the diagnosis of COPD, and recommendations for AATD screening in subjects with confirmed COPD. The latter was performed by ordering alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) serum levels. Each step of the CDSS algorithm approach was recorded and available to be retrieved at a later date for analysis. <b>Results:</b> Over 6 years, a total of 6,235 Veterans >40 years of age completed the CDSS. According to the COPD-PS questionnaire, 962 (18.5%) subjects were identified as high risk for COPD. An additional 579 subjects with a prior diagnosis of COPD also entered the subsequent steps of the CDSS algorithm. Of the high-risk cohort, the CDSS led to an increase in spirometry testing from 24% to 83% and led to a new diagnosis of COPD in 342 (43%). In the prior COPD diagnosis group, spirometry testing increased from 58% to 84%, leading to COPD reconfirmation in only 326 (67%). A total of 489 (68%) subjects with confirmed COPD completed AAT testing prompted by the CDSS, with 23 subjects identified with AATD and one with severe AATD. <b>Conclusions:</b> In the Veterans Affairs system, the use of a clinical decision support system algorithm that incorporates screening for COPD and AATD improves COPD over- and underdiagnosis and screening rates of AATD in a primary care setting."

    "abstract": "Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a genetic disorder, characterized by panacinar emphysema mainly in the lower lobes, and predisposes to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) at a younger age, especially in patients with concomitant cigarette smoking. Alpha-1 antitrypsin (a1-AT) is a serine protease inhibitor that mainly blocks neutrophil elastase and maintains protease/antiprotease balance in the lung and AATD is caused by mutations in the SERPINA1 gene that encodes a1-AT protein. PiZZ is the most common genotype associated with severe AATD, leading to reduced circulating levels of a1-AT. Besides its antiprotease function, a1-AT has anti-inflammatory and antioxidative effects and AATD results in defective innate immunity. Protease/antiprotease imbalance affects not only the lung parenchyma but also the small airways and recent studies have shown that AATD is associated with small airway dysfunction. Alterations in small airways structure with peripheral ventilation inhomogeneities may precede emphysema formation, providing a unique opportunity to detect early disease. The aim of the present review is to summarize the current evidence for the contribution of small airways disease in AATD-associated lung disease."

If all other treatment possibilities are exhausted or not possible (including rehabilitation, oxygen therapy, noninvasive ventilation, lung volume reduction), patients may qualify for lung transplantation. Strict selection criteria are implemented with a lot of relative and absolute contraindications. Because of an ongoing donor shortage, only a minority of endstage COPD patients will finally get transplanted. The procedure may involve a single or a double lung transplantation, dependent on the experience of the centre, the waiting list, the availability of donor lungs and the patient's risk-benefit ratio. In general, the life expectancy as well as the health-related quality of life after lung transplantation for COPD are usually increased, and may be somewhat better after double compared with single lung transplantation. Several specific complications can be encountered, such as the development of solid organ cancer and chronic lung allograft dysfunction, which develops in up to 50% of patients within 5 years of their transplant and has a major impact on long-term survival, because of the current inefficient treatment modalities."

However, the SERPINA1 gene displays high variability of frequent occurring genotypes among the general population. These different genotypes may affect A1AT expression and serum protein concentrations, and this is often not known, ignored, and/or not reported in serum proteomics studies. Here, we address allele-specific protein serum levels of A1AT in donors carrying the normal M variants of A1AT by measuring the proteoform profiles of purified A1AT from 81 serum samples, originating from 52 donors. When focusing on heterozygous donors, our data clearly reveal a statistically relevant difference in allele-specific protein serum levels of A1AT. In donors with genotype PI*M1VM1A, the experimentally observed ratio was approximately 1:1 (M1V/M1A, 1.00:0.96 ± 0.07, <i>n</i> = 17). For individuals with genotype PI*M1VM2, this ratio was 1:1.28 (M1V/M2, 1.00:1.31, ±0.19, <i>n</i> = 7).

Positive and negative residuals (reflecting higher or lower lung density than predicted from regression) were observed, which declined in magnitude over time following AECOPD events. Logistic regression confirmed a limited effect of patient characteristics on the absolute size of residuals, whereas AECOPD within 6 weeks of CT had a notable effect <i>versus</i> no AECOPD within 6 weeks (OR 5.707, 95% CI 3.375-9.652; p<0.0001). AECOPD result in higher or lower CT lung density estimates; the effect is greatest in the 2 weeks immediately after an AECOPD and persists for <6 weeks. Patient characteristics were less relevant than AECOPD within 6 weeks, supporting the reliability of PD15 as a measure of lung density.

Significant differences were observed within matched populations of severe AATD patients regarding risk of complications, age at onset, and disease course, including the dynamics of lung function decline. Genetic factors are among the putative modifiers contributing to the clinical variability in AATD, yet their role remains elusive. Here, we review and summarise our current understanding of epigenetic and genetic modifiers of pulmonary dysfunction in subjects with AATD."

    "abstract": "Alpha1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD), a common hereditary disorder affecting mainly lungs, liver and skin has been the focus of some of the most exciting therapeutic approaches in medicine in the past 5 years. In this review, we discuss the therapies presently available for the different manifestations of AATD and new therapies in the pipeline. We review therapeutic options for the individual lung, liver and skin manifestations of AATD along with approaches which aim to treat all three. Along with this renewed interest in treating AATD come challenges. How is AAT best delivered to the lung? What is the desired level of AAT in the circulation and lungs which therapeutics should aim to provide? Will treating the liver disease increase the potential for lung disease? Are there treatments to target the underlying genetic defect with the potential to prevent all aspects of AATDrelated disease? With a relatively small population able to participate in clinical studies, increased awareness and diagnosis of AATD is urgently needed. Better, more sensitive clinical parameters will assist in the generation of acceptable and robust evidence of therapeutic effect for current and emerging treatments."

    "abstract": "Altering the human genetic code has been explored since the early 1990s as a definitive answer for the treatment of monogenic and acquired diseases which do not respond to conventional therapies. In Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) the proper synthesis and secretion of alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) protein is impaired, leading to its toxic hepatic accumulation along with its pulmonary insufficiency, which is associated with parenchymal proteolytic destruction. Because AATD is caused by mutations in a single gene whose correction alone would normalize the mutant phenotype, it has become a popular target for both augmentation gene therapy and gene editing. Although gene therapy products are already a reality for the treatment of some pathologies, such as inherited retinal dystrophy and spinal muscular atrophy, AATD-related pulmonary and, especially, liver diseases still lack effective therapeutic options. Here, we review the course, challenges, and achievements of AATD gene therapy as well as update on new strategies being developed. Reaching safe and clinically effective expression of the AAT is currently the greatest challenge for AATD gene therapy. The improvement and emergence of technologies that use gene introduction, silencing and correction hold promise for the treatment of AATD."

The four groups did not differ in the proportion of Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Hemophilus influenzae. There was no statistically significant difference in use of high-frequency chest wall oscillation, pulmonary rehabilitation services, or suppressive macrolide treatment across the groups (P > 0.05).

    "abstract": "Environmental enteric dysfunction increases the likelihood of micronutrient deficiencies among infants, but few studies have assessed the potential impact of gut health on urinary iodine concentration (UIC) among this vulnerable group. We describe the trends of iodine status among infants from 6 to 24 mo old and examine the associations between intestinal permeability, inflammation, and UIC from 6 to 15 mo of age. Data from 1557 children enrolled in this birth cohort study conducted in 8 sites were included in these analyses. UIC was measured at 6, 15, and 24 mo of age by using the Sandell-Kolthoff technique. Gut inflammation and permeability were assessed using the concentrations of fecal neopterin (NEO), myeloperoxidase (MPO) and alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT), and lactulose-mannitol ratio (LM). A multinomial regression analysis was used to assess the classified UIC (deficiency or excess). Linear mixed regression was used to test the effect of interactions among biomarkers on logUIC. All studied populations had adequate (≥100 μg/L) to excess (≥371 μg/L) median UIC at 6 mo. Between 6 and 24 mo, 5 sites displayed a significant decline in the infant's median UIC. However, median UIC remained within the optimal range. An increase of NEO and MPO concentrations by +1 unit in ln scale reduced the risk of low UIC by 0.87 (95% CI: 0.78-0.97) and 0.86 (95% CI: 0.77-0.95), respectively. AAT moderated the association between NEO and UIC (P < 0.0001). The shape of this association appears to be asymmetric and in a reverse J-shape, with a higher UIC observed at both lower NEO and AAT concentrations. Excess UIC was frequent at 6 mo and tended to normalize at 24 mo. Aspects of gut inflammation and increased permeability appear to reduce the prevalence of low UIC in children aged 6 to 15 mo. Programs addressing iodine-related health should consider the role of gut permeability in vulnerable individuals."

    "abstract": "Pulmonary carcinoid tumorlet (PCT) is defined as small proliferation of neuroendocrine cells that invade the adjacent basement membrane. It is often associated with chronic pulmonary inflammatory processes. However, the characteristics of PCT in end-stage lung diseases remain unclear. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of the explanted lungs after transplantation at our institution between January 1999 and October 2020. Patients who underwent re-transplantation were excluded. Pulmonary carcinoid tumorlet was incidentally discovered in the explanted lungs from 15 patients (1.1%) out of 1367 lung transplants performed during the study period. Nine patients (60.0 %) were women, with a median age of 59 years (IQR: 57-62) at transplant. Underlying pulmonary indications for lung transplantation were chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (9/15, 60.0%), interstitial lung disease (2/15, 13.0%), pulmonary vascular disease (2/15, 13.0%), alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (1/15, 7.0%), and bronchiectasis (1/15, 7.0%). Of the patients who underwent bilateral lung transplantation (13/15, 86.7%), PCT was found in the right lung in 10 patients (10/13, 76.9%). Thirteen patients had one lesion, 1 patient had 2 lesions and 1 patient had multiple lesions. Our study shows that PCT is generally uncommon, but when it occurs, it occurs more frequently on the right side and in female patients with end-stage pulmonary disease. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease may be a predisposing factor for developing PCT."

We investigated Z-AAT polymers and the expression of fibrosis-related genes in liver tissues of PiZZ children with different clinical courses. Liver biopsies obtained during 1979-2010 at the Department of Paediatrics, Karolinska University Hospital, Sweden, were subjected to histological re-evaluation, immunohistochemistry and NanoString-based transcriptome profiling using a panel of 760 fibrosis plus 8 bile acid-related genes. Subjects were divided into three groups based on clinical outcomes: NCH (neonatal cholestasis, favourable outcome, <i>n</i> = 5), NCC (neonatal cholestasis, early cirrhosis and liver transplantation, <i>n</i> = 4), and NNCH (no neonatal cholestasis, favourable outcome, <i>n</i> = 5, six biopsies). Hepatocytes containing Z-AAT polymers were abundant in all groups whereas NCC showed higher expression of genes related to liver fibrosis/cirrhosis and lower expression of genes related to lipid, aldehyde/ketone, and bile acid metabolism. Z-AAT accumulation per se cannot explain the clinical outcomes of PiZZ children; however, changes in the expression of specific genes and pathways involved in lipid, fatty acid, and steroid metabolism appear to reflect the degree of liver injury."

It is widely used worldwide but remains unavailable to patients with AATD in the United Kingdom. While randomized trials of augmentation therapy have demonstrated biochemical efficacy and lung tissue preservation using computed tomography (CT) densitometry, these studies were not adequately powered to demonstrate effectiveness in well-accepted clinical endpoints such as quality of life (QOL) or survival. We used large, prospectively followed AATD patient populations in the United States and United Kingdom to explore these important clinical endpoints. Our inclusion criterion was adults with severe AATD and associated lung disease. The treatment group was U.S. AATD patients receiving augmentation therapy for lung disease. The control group was augmentation therapy naïve AATD patients. Multivariable regression and survival analyses were used to assess QOL and mortality outcomes respectively. Mean annual deterioration of the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire total score was 1.43 points greater/year in the control group compared to those receiving augmentation therapy (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.47 to 2.39, <i>p</i>=0.003).

There was significant heterogeneity between cohorts. A comparison of 2 highly characterized AATD cohorts was not able to reliably determine if AAT augmentation therapy improves QOL or mortality in patients with severe AATD-related lung disease.

Here, we investigated the characteristics of lower respiratory tract of AATD individuals prior to the onset of clinically significant COPD. Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed on 22 AATD with normal lung function and 14 healthy individuals. Cell counts and concentrations of proteases, alpha-1-antitrypsin and proinflammatory mediators were determined in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from study subjects. In order to determine the airway inflammation, we also analyzed immune cell components of the large airways from bronchial biopsies using immunohistochemistry in both study subjects. Finally, we made comparisons between airway inflammation and lung function rate of decline using four repeated lung function tests over one year in AATD individuals. AATD individuals with normal lung function had 3 folds higher neutrophil counts, 2 folds increase in the proteases levels, and 2-4 folds higher levels of IL-8, IL-6, IL-1β, and leukotriene B4 in their epithelial lining fluid compared to controls. Neutrophil elastase levels showed a positive correlation with the levels of IL-8 and neutrophils in AATD epithelial lining fluid. AATD individuals also showed a negative correlation of baseline FEV<sub>1</sub> with neutrophil count, neutrophil elastase, and cytokine levels in epithelial lining fluid (p < 0.05). In addition, we observed twofold increase in the number of lymphocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, and mast cells of AATD epithelial lining fluid as compared to controls. Mild inflammation is present in the lower respiratory tract and airways of AATD individuals despite having normal lung function. A declining trend was also noticed in the lung function of AATD individuals which was correlated with pro-inflammatory phenotype of their lower respiratory tract. This results suggest the presence of proinflammatory phenotype in AATD lungs. Therefore, early anti-inflammatory therapies may be a potential strategy to prevent progression of lung disease in AATD individuals."

This study's aim was to identify the changes that have taken place in AATD patient care as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain and to propose experts' recommendations aimed at ensuring humanized and quality care for people with AATD in the post-pandemic situation. A qualitative descriptive case study with a holistic single-case design was conducted, using focus groups with experts in AATD clinical management, including 15 health professionals with ties to the Spanish health system (12 pneumologists and 2 hospital pharmacists from 11 different hospitals in Spain) and 1 patient representative. COVID-19 has had a major impact on numerous aspects of AATD clinical patient management in Spain, including diagnostic, treatment, and follow-up phases. The experts concluded that there is a need to strengthen coordination between Primary Care and Hospital Care and improve the coordination processes across all the organizations and actors involved in the healthcare system. Regarding telemedicine and telecare, experts have concluded that it is necessary to promote this methodology and to develop protocols and training programs. Experts have recommended developing personalized and precision medicine, and patient participation in decision-making, promoting self-care and patient autonomy to optimize their healthcare and improve their quality of life. The possibility of monitoring and treating AATD patients from home has also been proposed by experts. Another result of the study was the recommendation of the need to ensure that plasma donations are made on a regular basis by a sufficient number of healthy individuals. The study advances knowledge by highlighting the challenges faced by health professionals and changes in AATD patient management in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. It also proposes experts' recommendations aimed at ensuring humanized and quality care for people with AATD in the post-pandemic situation.

    "abstract": "Neutrophil extracellular traps contribute to lung injury in cystic fibrosis and asthma, but the mechanisms are poorly understood. We sought to understand the impact of human NETs on barrier function in primary human bronchial epithelial and a human airway epithelial cell line. We demonstrate that NETs disrupt airway epithelial barrier function by decreasing transepithelial electrical resistance and increasing paracellular flux, partially by NET-induced airway cell apoptosis. NETs selectively impact the expression of tight junction genes claudins 4, 8 and 11. Bronchial epithelia exposed to NETs demonstrate visible gaps in E-cadherin staining, a decrease in full-length E-cadherin protein and the appearance of cleaved E-cadherin peptides. Pretreatment of NETs with alpha-1 antitrypsin (A1AT) inhibits NET serine protease activity, limits E-cadherin cleavage, decreases bronchial cell apoptosis and preserves epithelial integrity. In conclusion, NETs disrupt human airway epithelial barrier function through bronchial cell death and degradation of E-cadherin, which are limited by exogenous A1AT."

Expression of many of these lncRNAs were similarly altered in ZZ monocytes treated ex vivo with 27.5 μM AAT for 4 h. These properties may contribute to the manifold effects of AAT augmentation therapy."

    "abstract": "Genetic variation in alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) causes AAT deficiency (AATD) through liver aggregation-associated gain-of-toxic pathology and/or insufficient AAT activity in the lung manifesting as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Here, we utilize 71 AATD-associated variants as input through Gaussian process (GP)-based machine learning to study the correction of AAT folding and function at a residue-by-residue level by pharmacological activation of the ATF6 arm of the unfolded protein response (UPR). We show that ATF6 activators increase AAT neutrophil elastase (NE) inhibitory activity, while reducing polymer accumulation for the majority of AATD variants, including the prominent Z variant. GP-based profiling of the residue-by-residue response to ATF6 activators captures an unexpected role of the \"gate\" area in managing AAT-specific activity. Our work establishes a new spatial covariant (SCV) understanding of the convertible state of the protein fold in response to genetic perturbation and active environmental management by proteostasis enhancement for precision medicine."

Controversial data exist on the relevance of heterozygous Pi*Z carriage ('Pi*MZ' genotype) as an additional risk factor in patients with chronic viral hepatitis C to develop progressive liver fibrosis. (2) Methods: Two prospectively recruited cohorts totaling 572 patients with therapy-naïve chronic viral hepatitis C (HCV) were analyzed. The Frankfurt cohort included 337 patients and a second cohort from Leipzig included 235 patients. The stage of liver fibrosis was assessed by liver biopsy, AST-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) score and Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) score (Frankfurt) as well as liver stiffness measurement (LSM) via transient elastography (Leipzig). All patients were genotyped for the Pi*Z variant (rs28929474) of the <i>SERPINA1</i> gene. (3) Results: In the Frankfurt cohort, 16/337 (4.7%) patients carried the heterozygous Pi*Z allele while 10/235 (4.3%) in the Leipzig cohort were Pi*Z carriers. In both cohorts, there was no higher proportion of Pi*Z heterozygosity in patients with cirrhosis compared to patients without cirrhosis or patients with cirrhosis vs. no liver fibrosis. Accordingly, Pi*Z frequency was not different in histological or serological stages of liver fibrosis (F0-F4) and showed no clear association with LSM. (4) Conclusions: Evaluation in two representative HCV cohorts does not indicate Pi*Z heterozygosity as a clinically relevant disease modifier in chronic HCV infection. However, validation in even larger cohorts with longitudinal follow-up is warranted."

    "abstract": "α1-antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency is a common autosomal recessive hereditary disorder, with a high risk for the development of early-onset panacinar emphysema. AAT, produced primarily in the liver, functions to protect the lung from neutrophil protease; with AAT deficiency, unimpeded neutrophil proteases destroy the lung parenchyma. AAT is susceptible to oxidative damage resulting in an inability to inhibit its target proteases, neutrophil elastase, and cathepsin G. The major sites of oxidative modification on the AAT molecule are methionine residues 351 and 358. We have previously demonstrated that an engineered variant of AAT that resists oxidation by modifying both protein surface methionines (M351V and M358L) provides antiprotease protection, despite oxidative stress. In mice, intravenous delivery of the modified AAT(AVL) variant by AAV serotype 8, AAV8hAAT(AVL), primarily to the liver resulted in long-term expression of an AAT that resists oxidative inactivation. In this study, we evaluated the safety of intravenous administration of AAV8hAAT(AVL) in a dose-escalating, blinded, placebo-controlled toxicology study in wild-type mice. The study assessed organ histology and clinical pathology findings of mice, intravenously administered AAV8hAAT(AVL) at three doses (5.0 × 10<sup>11</sup>, 5.0 × 10<sup>12</sup>, and 5.0 × 10<sup>13</sup> genome copies [gc]/kg), compared to control mice injected intravenously with phosphate-buffered saline. As previously demonstrated, administration of AAV8hAAT(AVL) resulted in dose-dependent expression of high, potentially therapeutic, levels of serum human AAT protein that persist for at least 6 months. Antibodies against the AAV8 capsid were elicited as expected, but there was no antibody detected against the AAT(AVL) protein generated by the AAV8hAAT(AVL) vector. There was no morbidity or mortality observed in the study. The data demonstrate that intravenous administration of AAV8hAAT(AVL) is safe with no significant adverse effect attributed to AAV8hAAT(AVL) vector at any dose. This study demonstrates that AAV8hAAT(AVL) has a safety profile consistent with the requirements for proceeding to a clinical study."

Its management currently consists of weekly infusions of plasma-purified human AAT, which poses several issues regarding plasma supplies, possible pathogen transmission, purification costs, and parenteral administration. Here, we investigated an alternative administration strategy for augmentation therapy by combining recombinant expression of AAT in bacteria and the production of a respirable powder by spray drying. The same formulation approach was then applied to plasma-derived AAT for comparison. Purified, active, and endotoxin-free recombinant AAT was produced at high yields and formulated using L-leucine and mannitol as excipients after identifying compromise conditions for protein activity and good aerodynamic performances. An oxygen-free atmosphere, both during formulation and powder storage, slowed down methionine-specific oxidation and AAT inactivation. This work is the first peer-reviewed report of AAT formulated as a dry powder, which could represent an alternative to current treatments."

Genotyping characterization of SERPIN1 was compared to a control population of 2848 Caucasian individuals with the same geographical origin and similar demographic characteristics. Among 173 patients included in the study, the prevalence of AAT deficiency was 0. Genotype analysis was piMM in 166 (94.9%) patients and piMS in 9 patients (5.1%), respectively.

We used the Danish National Patient Registry to identify patients with dAATD based on the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) code E88.0A and the Danish Civil Registration System (CRS) for population counts and vital status. We estimated dAATD prevalence, incidence and mortality. We compared mortality among patients with dAATD and an age-matched and sex-matched cohort extracted from the Danish CRS. We conducted a sensitivity analysis to examine whether coding changes during 2000-2018, from a general to a more specific ICD-10 code for AATD, and left truncation affected results appreciably. The prevalence of dAATD was 12.9 (95% CI 11.9 to 13.8) per 100 000 persons. The age distribution was bimodal, with peaks at ages ≤12 and ≥45 years. The incidence rate per 100 000 person-years was 0.90 (95% CI 0.85 to 0.96), again with a bimodal age distribution. Mortality was higher for patients with dAATD than for the general population (mortality rate ratio (mRR) 4.7, 95% CI 4.1 to 5.3), especially for children (mRR 33.8, 95% CI 6.8 to 167.4). The sensitivity analysis indicated that dAATD prevalence might have been as high as 19.7 per 100 000 persons due to less specific ICD-10 coding for AATD early in the study period or 21.4 per 100 000 persons correcting for left truncation. Diagnosed AATD was associated with increased mortality, especially for children. The finding for children was based on few deaths and had very wide 95% CIs."

A retrospective analysis was performed of all patients treated with EBV with confirmed AATD or with a reduced AAT serum level at the University Medical Center Groningen between 2013 and 2021. Baseline and 6-month follow-up assessment included chest CT, pulmonary function measurement, 6-min walking distance (6MWD), and St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). In total, 53 patients were included, 30 patients in the AATD group (AAT <0.6 g/L or confirmed ZZ phenotype) and 23 patients in the reduced AAT group (AAT 0.6-1 g/L). In both groups, all response variables improved significantly after treatment. There was a median increase in forced expiratory volume in 1 s of 105 mL (12% relative) and 280 mL (31% relative) in the AATD and reduced AAT groups, respectively. 6MWD increased by 62 min and 52 min, and SGRQ decreased by 12.5 patients and 18.7 patients, respectively. A pneumothorax occurred in 10% and 13% of patients, and no patients died. EBV treatment in patients with emphysema and AATD or a reduced AAT level is feasible and results in significant improvements in pulmonary function, exercise capacity, and quality of life and has an acceptable safety profile."

She presented with recurrent hospitalizations for frequent exacerbations. After lung reduction, the patient displayed improvement in functional status without hospitalizations at the 15-month follow-up. Careful history taking is essential for any patients diagnosed with lower lobe emphysema to elucidate the underlying etiology. This case challenges the notion that basilar emphysema is sensitive or specific for AATD and emphasizes that this pattern of emphysema has a broad differential diagnosis and alternative etiologies should be considered. Our patient was ultimately diagnosed with smoking-related emphysema, with atypical bibasilar involvement.

We aimed to determine the association between heterozygous Pi*MZ and Pi*MS variants and development of hepatic decompensation events in NAFLD patients. We included patients with NAFLD who also had A1AT genotyping performed from 2005 to 2020. We recorded demographic and clinical variables, and data on hepatic events (ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, esophageal variceal bleed, or hepatocellular carcinoma), if any. We performed binary logistic regression analysis to assess the association between A1AT variants and hepatic events, and calculated Odds ratio (OR) with their 95% confidence intervals (Cl). We included 1532 patients with NAFLD, of which 1249 patients had Pi*MM, 121 had Pi*MS, and 162 had Pi*MZ. Of the 1532 patients, hepatic events developed in 521 (34%) patients. The percentage of patients with Pi*MZ variant was significantly higher in patients with hepatic events as compared to patients without hepatic events (18.7 % vs 8.1%, p<0.0001). Pi*MZ variant was noted to significantly increase the odds of developing hepatic events in NAFLD patients, unadjusted OR: 1.82 (1.3-2.5, p<0.001), adjusted OR (for age, sex, body mass index, and diabetes mellitus) 1.76 (1.2-2.5, p = 0.002). Pi*MS variant did not increase the odds of hepatic events in NAFLD patients, OR: 0.92 (0.6-1.4, p = 0.70). Patients with NAFLD and A1AT Pi*MZ variant are at increased risk for developing hepatic decompensation.

However, their actual role in maintenance of structural and functional characteristics of the corresponding α-1 anti-trypsin (A1AT) protein is not well characterized. <b>Methods:</b> The A1ATD causative <i>SERPINA1</i> missense variants were initially collected from variant databases, and they were filtered based on their pathogenicity potential. Then, the tertiary protein models were constructed and the impact of individual variants on secondary structure, stability, protein-protein interactions, and molecular dynamic (MD) features of the A1AT protein was studied using diverse computational methods. <b>Results:</b> We identified that A1ATD linked <i>SERPINA1</i> missense variants like F76S, S77F, L278P, E288V, G216C, and H358R are highly deleterious as per the consensual prediction scores of SIFT, PolyPhen, FATHMM, M-CAP and REVEL computational methods. All these variants were predicted to alter free energy dynamics and destabilize the A1AT protein. These variants were seen to cause minor structural drifts at residue level (RMSD = <2Å) of the protein. Interestingly, S77F and L278P variants subtly alter the size of secondary structural elements like beta pleated sheets and loops. The residue level fluctuations at 100 ns simulation confirm the highly damaging structural consequences of all the six missense variants on the conformation dynamics of the A1AT protein. Moreover, these variants were also predicted to cause functional deformities by negatively impacting the binding energy of A1AT protein with NE ligand molecule. <b>Conclusion:</b> This study adds a new computational biology dimension to interpret the genotype-protein phenotype relationship between S<i>ERPINA1</i> pathogenic variants with its structural plasticity and functional behavior with NE ligand molecule contributing to the Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency. Our results support that A1ATD complications correlates with the conformational flexibility and its propensity of A1AT protein polymerization when misfolded."

    "abstract": "Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is characterized by reduced serum levels of the AAT protein and predisposes to liver and lung disease. The characterization at structural level of novel pathogenic SERPINA1 mutants coding for circulating AAT could provide novel insights into the mechanisms of AAT misfolding. The present study aimed to provide a practical framework for the identification and analysis of new AAT mutations, combining structural simulations and clinical data. We analysed a total of five mutations (four not previously described) in a total of six subjects presenting moderate to severe AATD: Gly95Alafs*18, Val210Glu, Asn247Ser, Pi*S + Asp341His and Pi*S + Leu383Phe + Lys394Ile. Clinical data, genotyping and phenotyping assays, structural mapping, and conformational characterization through molecular dynamic (MD) simulations were developed and combined. Newly discovered AAT missense variants were localized both on the interaction surface and the hydrophobic core of the protein. Distribution of mutations across the structure revealed Val210Glu at the solvent exposed s4C strand and close to the \"Gate\" region. Asn247Ser was located on the accessible surface, which is important for glycan attachment. On the other hand, Asp341His, Leu383Phe were mapped close to the \"breach\" and \"shutter\" regions. MD analysis revealed the reshaping of local interactions around the investigated substitutions that have varying effects on AAT conformational flexibility, hydrophobic packing, and electronic surface properties. The most severe structural changes were observed in the double- and triple-mutant (Pi*S + Asp341His and Pi*S + Leu383Phe + Lys394Ile) molecular models. The two carriers presented impaired lung function. The results characterize five variants, four of them previously unknown, of the SERPINA1 gene, which define new alleles contributing to the deficiency of AAT. Rare variants might be more frequent than expected, and therefore, in discordant cases, standardized screening of the S and Z alleles needs complementation with gene sequencing and structural approaches. The utility of computational modelling for providing supporting evidence of the pathogenicity of rare single nucleotide variations is discussed."

Here, we describe the derivation of syngeneic induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) engineered to determine the effects of ZAAT heterozygosity in iPSC-hepatocytes (iHeps). We find that heterozygous MZ iHeps exhibit an intermediate disease phenotype and share with ZZ iHeps alterations in AAT protein processing and downstream perturbations including altered endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondrial morphology, reduced mitochondrial respiration, and branch-specific activation of the unfolded protein response in cell subpopulations. Our model of MZ heterozygosity thus provides evidence that a single Z allele is sufficient to disrupt hepatocyte homeostatic function."

    "abstract": "Colitis-associated colon cancer (CAC) accompanies the massive infiltration of neutrophils during tumorigenesis and progression of CAC. Depletion of neutrophils in circulation results in significant inhibition of tumor incidence in CAC. However, the underlying mechanisms are largely unclear. In this study, we provide evidence for the crucial involvement of inflammatory neutrophil-activated serine proteases (NSPs) on the dysregulation of the anti-inflammatory and antitumor IGFBP-3/IGFBP-3R signaling axis in CAC using a chronic AOM/DSS mouse model. We also provide preclinical evidence for α1-antitrypsin (AAT) as a preventive and as a therapeutic for CAC. AAT administration not only prevented colitis-associated tumorigenesis but also inhibited established CAC. AOM/DSS treatment results in the significant activation of NSPs, leading to CAC through increased pro-inflammatory cytokines and decreased anti-inflammatory and antitumor IGFBP-3. Collectively, these data suggest that the NSPs proteolyze IGFBP-3, whereas AAT inhibits chronic colonic inflammation-induced NSP activity and subsequently suppresses IGFBP-3 proteolysis. Therefore, the anti-inflammatory and antitumor functions of the IGFBP-3/IGFBP-3R axis are restored. AAT mimicking small peptides also showed their inhibitory effects on NSP-induced IGFBP-3 proteolysis. These results suggest that targeting the NSP-IGFBP-3/IGFBP-3R axis using NSP inhibitors such as AAT and the AAT mimics and IGFBP-3R agonists could lead to novel approaches for the prevention and treatment of CAC."

Serum protein electrophoresis was performed on 200 samples on the Capillarys 2 and the V8 Nexus. The latter presents two α<sub>1</sub> bands (α<sub>1</sub> band 1 and 2) while the Capillarys 2 has only one (Capillarys 2 total α<sub>1</sub>). The measures of A1AT and α<sub>1</sub> acid glycoprotein (AAG) were performed as well as the phenotyping of M, S and Z alleles. At a A1AT cutoff of 0.80 g/L, a cutoff of 1.21 g/L using the V8 Nexus α<sub>1</sub> band 2 corresponded to a 100% sensitivity and a 92.4% specificity while a 1.69% cutoff corresponded to a 100% sensitivity and a 92.4% specificity. The performance of the α<sub>1</sub> band 1 was suboptimal and rather corresponded to AAG. On the Capillarys 2, a cutoff of 2.0 g/L corresponded to a 75.0% sensitivity and a 86.6% specificity, while a 3.2% cutoff showed a 96.4% sensitivity and a 67.4% specificity. The V8 Nexus α<sub>1</sub> band 2 was the method the most correlated with A1AT (r=0.90-0.94). The V8 Nexus α<sub>1</sub> band 2 was the best predictor of A1AT deficiency, probably owing to a better resolution. The use of SPE was however unable to predict each phenotype. Phenotype or genotype studies are therefore still advisable in case of A1AT deficiency."

By analogy with the data obtained in the last century, when the first cause of the genetic deficiency of α<sub>1</sub>-antitrypsin leading to elastase activation in pulmonary emphysema was proven, it can be supposed that proteolysis hyperactivation in COVID-19 may be associated with the impaired functions of α<sub>1</sub>-PI. The purpose of this review was to systematize the scientific data and critical directions for translational studies on the role of α<sub>1</sub>-PI in SARS-CoV-2-induced proteolysis hyperactivation as a diagnostic marker and a therapeutic target. This review describes the proteinase-dependent stages of viral infection: the reception and penetration of the virus into a cell and the imbalance of the plasma aldosterone-angiotensin-renin, kinin, and blood clotting systems. The role of ACE2, TMPRSS, ADAM17, furin, cathepsins, trypsin- and elastase-like serine proteinases in the virus tropism, the activation of proteolytic cascades in blood, and the COVID-19-dependent complications is considered. The scientific reports on α<sub>1</sub>-PI involvement in the SARS-CoV-2-induced inflammation, the relationship with the severity of infection and comorbidities were analyzed. Particular attention is paid to the acquired α<sub>1</sub>-PI deficiency in assessing the state of patients with proteolysis overactivation and chronic non-inflammatory diseases, which are accompanied by the risk factors for comorbidity progression and the long-term consequences of COVID-19. Essential data on the search and application of protease inhibitor drugs in the therapy for bronchopulmonary and cardiovascular pathologies were analyzed. The evidence of antiviral, anti-inflammatory, anticoagulant, and anti-apoptotic effects of α<sub>1</sub>-PI, as well as the prominent data and prospects for its application as a targeted drug in the SARS-CoV-2 acquired pneumonia and related disorders, are presented."

    "title": "Novel SERPINA1 Alleles Identified through a Large Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency Screening Program and Review of Known Variants.",
    "abstract": "The <i>SERPINA1</i> gene encodes the serine protease inhibitor alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) and is located on chromosome 14q31-32.3 in a cluster of homologous genes likely formed by exon duplication. AAT has a variety of anti-inflammatory properties. Its clinical relevance is best illustrated by the genetic disease alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) which is associated with an increased risk for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and cirrhosis. While 2 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) , S and Z, are responsible for more than 95% of all individuals with AATD, there are a number of rare variants associated with deficiency and dysfunction, as well as those associated with normal levels and function. Our laboratory has identified a number of novel AAT alleles that we report in this manuscript. We screened more than 500,000 individuals for AATD alleles through our testing program over the past 20 years. The characterization of these alleles was accomplished by DNA sequencing, measurement of AAT plasma levels and isoelectric focusing at pH 4-5. We report 22 novel AAT alleles discovered through our screening programs, such as Z<sub>little rock</sub> and QO<sub>chillicothe</sub>, and review the current literature of known AAT genetic variants."

    "abstract": "Messenger RNA (mRNA) technology has already been successfully tested preclinically and there are ongoing clinical trials for protein replacement purposes; however, more effort has been put into the development of prevention strategies against infectious diseases. Apparently, mRNA vaccine approval against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a landmark for opening new opportunities for managing diverse health disorders based on this approach. Indeed, apart from infectious diseases, it has also been widely tested in numerous directions including cancer prevention and the treatment of inherited disorders. Interestingly, self-amplifying RNA (saRNA)-based technology is believed to display more developed RNA therapy compared with conventional mRNA technique in terms of its lower dosage requirements, relatively fewer side effects, and possessing long-lasting effects. Nevertheless, some challenges still exist that need to be overcome in order to achieve saRNA-based drug approval in clinics. Hence, the current review discusses the feasibility of saRNA utility for protein replacement therapy on various health disorders including rare hereditary diseases and also provides a detailed overview of saRNA advantages, its molecular structure, mechanism of action, and relevant delivery platforms."

    "title": "Epidemiology and prevalence of lean nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and associated cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and cardiovascular outcomes in the United States: a population-based study and review of literature.",
    "abstract": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is linked to obesity and metabolic syndrome conditions. However, a subset of NAFLD patients express a normal or low body mass index (lean NAFLD [L-NAFLD]). Our aim is to compare the prevalence of L-NAFLD to the obesity-associated NAFLD in the United States by assessing prevalence, potential risk factors, liver-related complications, and coronary artery disease outcomes. A multicenter database (Explorys Inc.) of >70 million patients across the United States was screened. A cohort of patients with \"nonalcoholic fatty liver\" between 1999 and 2021 was identified. Two sub-cohorts of NAFLD patients were identified: those with a body mass index (BMI) < 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (L-NAFLD) and those with a BMI > 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (obesity-associated NAFLD). We excluded patients with age <18 and those who have viral hepatitis, hemochromatosis, Wilson's disease, biliary cirrhosis, alcoholic liver disease, cystic fibrosis, alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, and autoimmune hepatitis. Multivariate analysis was performed to adjust for confounders. 68 892 260 individuals were screened. NAFLD prevalence was four per 100 000, and L-NAFLD prevalence was 0.6 per 100 000. Compared with those without, patients with L-NAFLD tended to be older (OR 2.16), females (OR 1.28), and smokers (OR 4.67) and of Asian race (OR 2.12). L-NAFLD patients were more likely to have acute coronary syndromes (OR 30.00) and metabolic syndrome (OR 2.31) despite the normal/low BMI. Esophageal varices and hepatocellular carcinoma risks were high in both cirrhosis patients. This is the largest study to assess L-NAFLD prevalence in the United States. L-NAFLD are at a significantly higher risk for acute coronary syndromes, esophageal varices, and hepatocellular carcinoma."

    "abstract": "Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a genetic disease caused by a hepatic accumulation of mutant alpha-1 antitrypsin (ZAAT). Individuals with AATD are prone to develop a chronic liver disease that remains undiagnosed until late stage of the disease. Here, we sought to characterize the liver pathophysiology of a human transgenic mouse model for AATD with a manifestation of liver disease compared with normal transgenic mice model. Male and female transgenic mice for normal (Pi*M) and mutant variant (Pi*Z) human alpha-1 antitrypsin at 3 and 6 mo of age were subjected to this study. The progression of hepatic ZAAT accumulation, hepatocyte injury, steatosis, liver inflammation, and fibrotic features were monitored by performing an in vivo study. We have also performed a Next-Gene transcriptomic analysis of the transgenic mice liver tissue 16 h after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration to delineate liver inflammatory response in Pi*Z mice as compared with Pi*M. Our results show hepatic ZAAT accumulation, followed by hepatocyte ballooning and liver steatosis developed at 3 mo in Pi*Z mice compared with the mice carrying normal variant of human alpha-1 antitrypsin. We observed higher levels of hepatic immune cell infiltrations in both 3- and 6-mo-old Pi*Z mice compared with Pi*M as an indication of liver inflammation. Liver fibrosis was observed as accumulation of collagen in 6-mo-old Pi*Z liver tissues compared with Pi*M control mice. Furthermore, the transcriptomic analysis revealed a dysregulated liver immune response to LPS in Pi*Z mice compared with Pi*M. Of particular interest for translational work, this study aims to establish a mouse model of AATD with a strong manifestation of liver disease that will be a valuable in vivo tool to study the pathophysiology of AATD-mediated liver disease. Our data suggest that the human transgenic mouse model of AATD could provide a suitable model for the evaluation of therapeutic approaches and preventive reagents against AATD-mediated liver disease.<b>NEW & NOTEWORTHY</b> We have characterized a mouse model of human alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency with a strong manifestation of liver disease that can be used as an in vivo tool to test preventive and therapeutic reagents. Our data explores the altered immunophenotype of alpha-1 antitrypsin-deficient liver macrophages and suggests a relationship between acute inflammation, immune response, and fibrosis."

    "abstract": "Human alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT) encoded by the <i>SERPINA1</i> gene, is an acute phase glycoprotein that regulates inflammatory responses <i>via</i> both protease inhibitory and non-inhibitory activities. We previously reported that AAT controls ATP-induced IL-1β release from human mononuclear cells by stimulating the release of small bioactive molecules. In the current study, we aimed to elucidate the identity of these putative effectors released from human PBMCs in response to AAT, which may inhibit the LPS-induced release of IL-1β. We pre-incubated human PBMCs alone or with different preparations of AAT (4 mg/ml) for 30 min at 37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, and collected cell supernatants filtered through centrifugal filters (cutoff 3 kDa) to eliminate AAT and other high molecular weight substances. Supernatants passed through the filters were used to culture PBMCs isolated from the autologous or a heterologous donors with or without adding LPS (1 μg/ml) for 6 h. Unexpectedly, supernatants from PBMCs pre-incubated with AAT (Zemaira<sup>®</sup>), but not with other AAT preparations tested or with oxidized AAT (Zemaira<sup>®</sup>), lowered the LPS-induced release of IL-1β by about 25%-60% without affecting <i>IL1B</i> mRNA. The reversed-phase liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry did not confirm the hypothesis that small pro-resolving lipid mediators released from PBMCs after exposure to AAT (Zemaira<sup>®</sup>) are responsible for lowering the LPS-induced IL-1β release. Distinctively from other AAT preparations, AAT (Zemaira<sup>®</sup>) and supernatants from PBMCs pre-treated with this protein contained high levels of total thiols. In line, mass spectrometry analysis revealed that AAT (Zemaira<sup>®</sup>) protein contains freer Cys232 than AAT (Prolastin<sup>®</sup>). Our data show that a free Cys232 in AAT is required for controlling LPS-induced IL-1β release from human PBMCs. Further studies characterizing AAT preparations used to treat patients with inherited AAT deficiency remains of clinical importance."

    "abstract": "Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency associated liver disease (AATD-LD) is a rare genetic disorder and not well-recognized. Predicting the clinical outcomes of AATD-LD and defining patients more likely to progress to advanced liver disease are crucial for better understanding AATD-LD progression and promoting timely medical intervention. We aimed to develop a tailored machine learning (ML) model to predict the disease progression of AATD-LD. This analysis was conducted through a stacking ensemble learning model by combining five different ML algorithms with 58 predictor variables using nested five-fold cross-validation with repetitions based on the UK Biobank data. Performance of the model was assessed through prediction accuracy, area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC), and area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC). The importance of predictor contributions was evaluated through a feature importance permutation method. The proposed stacking ensemble ML model showed clinically meaningful accuracy and appeared superior to any single ML algorithms in the ensemble, e.g., the AUROC for AATD-LD was 68.1%, 75.9%, 91.2%, and 67.7% for all-cause mortality, liver-related death, liver transplant, and all-cause mortality or liver transplant, respectively. This work supports the use of ML to address the unanswered clinical questions with clinically meaningful accuracy using real-world data."

    "abstract": "α1-antitrypsin (A1AT) is a circulating serine protease inhibitor and an acute phase reactant, the deficiency of which can lead to liver failure and chronic lung disease. Flavonoid treatment may induce changes in α<sub>1</sub>-antitrypsin production in some human cells. The purpose of this study is to investigate the properties of the A1AT protein that interacts with the flavonoid luteolin, which exhibits numerous properties, including antioxidant properties. For this purpose, multi-spectroscopic (UV-Vis spectroscopy, fluorescence and FRET) methods and molecular docking were used. The intrinsic fluorescence of A1AT was quenched by luteolin through a static mechanism. Luteolin binds to one site of the A1AT protein, with a moderate binding constant, and the binding process was driven by entropy and hydrophobic interactions. Hydrophobicity around Trp decreased as a result of luteolin binding to the A1AT site and FRET occurred at a distance of 3.11 nm. Under the action of temperature, the stability of A1AT structure was decreased by the presence of luteolin. Molecular docking confirmed that luteolin binds to one site, with a moderate affinity. The results would give a better understanding of the functional changes that occurred in the structure of A1AT induced by luteolin binding, which may have implications in the field of pharmaceutical research.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

However, the role of the <i>SERPINA1</i> Pi∗Z allele in patients who have already progressed to ACLD is unclear. Thus, we aimed to evaluate the impact of the Pi∗Z allele on the risk of liver transplantation/liver-related death in patients with ACLD, while adjusting for the severity of liver disease at inclusion. A total of 1,118 patients with ACLD who underwent hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) measurement and genotyping for the Pi∗Z/Pi∗S allele at the Vienna Hepatic Hemodynamic Lab were included in this retrospective analysis. The outcome of interest was liver transplantation/liver-related death, while non-liver-related death and removal/suppression of the primary etiological factor were considered as competing risks. Viral hepatitis was the most common etiology (44%), followed by alcohol-related (31%) and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (11%). Forty-two (4%) and forty-six (4%) patients harboured the Pi∗Z and Pi∗S variants, respectively. Pi∗Z carriers had more severe portal hypertension (HVPG: 19±6 <i>vs.</i>15±7 mmHg; <i>p <</i>0.001) and hepatic dysfunction (Child-Turcotte-Pugh: 7.1±1.9 <i>vs.</i> 6.5±1.9 points; <i>p =</i> 0.050) at inclusion, compared to non-carriers. Contrarily, the Pi∗S allele was unrelated to liver disease severity. In competing risk regression analysis, harbouring the Pi∗Z allele was significantly associated with an increased probability of liver transplantation/liver-related death, even after adjusting for liver disease severity at inclusion. The detrimental impact of the common Pi∗MZ genotype (adjusted subdistribution hazard ratio: ≈1.56 <i>vs.</i> Pi∗MM) was confirmed in a fully adjusted subgroup analysis. In contrast, Pi∗S carriers had no increased risk of events. Genotyping for the Pi∗Z allele identifies patients with ACLD at increased risk of adverse liver-related outcomes, thereby improving prognostication. Therapies targeting the accumulation of abnormal AAT should be evaluated as disease-modifying treatments in Pi∗Z allele carriers with ACLD. Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is a genetic disease that affects the lung and the liver. Carrying two dysfunctional copies of the gene causes advanced liver disease. Harbouring one dysfunctional copy increases disease severity in patients with other liver illness. However, the significance of this genetic defect in patients who already suffer from advanced liver disease is unclear. Our study found that harbouring at least one dysfunctional copy of the alpha-1 antitrypsin gene increases the risk of requiring a liver transplantation or dying from a liver disease. This indicates the need for medical therapies aimed at treating the hepatic consequences of this genetic defect."

Patients with the PI*SZ genotype were younger, more frequently non-index cases and had a lower frequency of respiratory diseases except asthma compared with PI*ZZ patients. Among patients with respiratory diseases, PI*SZ individuals were significantly older both at onset of symptoms and at diagnosis; only asthma was more frequent in PI*SZ than in PI*ZZ individuals. Twelve PI*SZ patients (15.4%) received augmentation therapy compared with 94 PI*ZZ patients (66.2%; p<0.001). There is a high prevalence of PI*SZ in Spain. Patients with the PI*SZ genotype were older at symptom onset and diagnosis and had less severe lung disease compared with PI*ZZ patients.

    "abstract": "α1-Antitrypsin (AAT), a serine protease inhibitor, is the third most abundant protein in plasma. Although the best-known function of AAT is irreversible inhibition of elastase, AAT is an acute-phase reactant and is increasingly recognized to have a panoply of other functions, including as an anti-inflammatory mediator and a host-protective molecule against various pathogens. Although a canonical receptor for AAT has not been identified, AAT can be internalized into the cytoplasm and is known to affect gene regulation. Because AAT has anti-inflammatory properties, we examined whether AAT binds the cytoplasmic glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in human macrophages. We report the finding that AAT binds to GR using several approaches, including coimmunoprecipitation, mass spectrometry, and microscale thermophoresis. We also performed in silico molecular modeling and found that binding between AAT and GR has a plausible stereochemical basis. The significance of this interaction in macrophages is evinced by AAT inhibition of LPS-induced NF-κB activation and IL-8 production as well as AAT induction of angiopoietin-like 4 protein, which are, in part, dependent on GR. Furthermore, this AAT-GR interaction contributes to a host-protective role against mycobacteria in macrophages. In summary, this study identifies a new mechanism for the gene regulation, anti-inflammatory, and host-defense properties of AAT."

    "abstract": "Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a rare cause of noncystic fibrosis (CF) bronchiectasis. The benefits of augmentation therapy in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and pulmonary emphysema are well established. The role of augmentation therapy in AATD bronchiectasis in patients without pulmonary emphysema is not clear. We present the case of a 53-year-old woman (never smoker) who presented with increased susceptibility to infection, productive cough, and intermittent hemoptysis. Pulmonary function testing revealed restrictive impairment [VC 2,7 l (83% of pred.), FEV1 2,3 l (86% of pred.)]. A CT scan of the chest showed marked basal bronchiectasis with mucoid impaction, surrounding consolidation, and no emphysema. Despite frequent use of inhalation therapy, a satisfactory control of symptoms and exacerbations was not achieved. In the course of extended diagnostics regarding the genesis of bronchiectasis, a reduced alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT) serum level was detected, and a genetic test revealed a homozygous Pi*ZZ genotype. We started augmentation therapy with AAT (Respreeza®, CLS Behring) at the dose of 60 mg/kg per week; the therapy was well tolerated by the patient, and she reported clinical improvement with a reduction in exacerbation frequency. AAT is a serine protease inhibitor and plays a major role in regulating inflammatory activities, in particular by inhibiting neutrophil elastase (NE). The present case illustrates the positive effect of augmentation therapy, including patients without airway obstruction. Among other causes, AATD should be considered as a possible cause of bronchiectasis, and the effects of augmentation therapy for this indication need to be prospectively studied."

Our objectives to identify unique and shared AATD plasma biomarkers with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may explain AATD phenotypic heterogeneity. The plasma or serum of 5,924 subjects from four AATD and COPD cohorts were analyzed on SomaScan V4.0 platform. Using multivariable linear regression, inverse variance random-effects meta-analysis, and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression we tested the association between 4,720 individual proteins or combined in a protein score with emphysema measured by 15th percentile lung density (PD15) or diffusion capacity (DLCO) in distinct AATD genotypes (Pi*ZZ, Pi*SZ, Pi*MZ) and non-AATD, PiMM COPD subjects. AAT SOMAmer accuracy for identifying AATD was tested using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. In PiZZ AATD subjects, 2 unique proteins were associated with PD15 and 98 proteins with DLCO. Of those, 68 were also associated with DLCO in COPD also and enriched for three cellular component pathways: insulin-like growth factor, lipid droplet, and myosin complex. PiMZ AATD subjects shared similar proteins associated with DLCO as COPD subjects. Our emphysema protein score included 262 SOMAmers and predicted emphysema in AATD and COPD subjects. SOMAmer AAT level <7.99 relative fluorescence unit (RFU) had 100% sensitivity and specificity for identifying Pi*ZZ, but it was lower for other AATD genotypes. Using SomaScan, we identified unique and shared plasma biomarkers between AATD and COPD subjects and generated a protein score that strongly associates with emphysema in COPD and AATD.

Point mutations in the <i>SERPINA1</i> gene can lead to the misfolding, intracellular accumulation, and deficiency of circulating AAT protein, increasing the risk of developing chronic liver diseases or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Currently, siRNA technology can knock down the <i>SERPINA1</i> gene and limit defective AAT production. How this latter affects other liver genes is unknown.

    "abstract": "SERPINA1 mRNAs encode the protease inhibitor α-1-antitrypsin and are regulated through post-transcriptional mechanisms. α-1-antitrypsin deficiency leads to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and liver cirrhosis, and specific variants in the 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) are associated with COPD. The NM_000295.4 transcript is well expressed and translated in lung and blood and features an extended 5'-UTR that does not contain a competing upstream open reading frame (uORF). We show that the 5'-UTR of NM_000295.4 folds into a well-defined multi-helix structural domain. We systematically destabilized mRNA structure across the NM_000295.4 5'-UTR, and measured changes in (SHAPE quantified) RNA structure and cap-dependent translation relative to a native-sequence reporter. Surprisingly, despite destabilizing local RNA structure, most mutations either had no effect on or decreased translation. Most structure-destabilizing mutations retained native, global 5'-UTR structure. However, those mutations that disrupted the helix that anchors the 5'-UTR domain yielded three groups of non-native structures. Two of these non-native structure groups refolded to create a stable helix near the translation initiation site that decreases translation. Thus, in contrast to the conventional model that RNA structure in 5'-UTRs primarily inhibits translation, complex folding of the NM_000295.4 5'-UTR creates a translation-optimized message by promoting accessibility at the translation initiation site."

AlphaNet subscribers were asked about changes in their usual respiratory symptoms, whether they considered changes in symptoms to be pulmonary exacerbations, and their management. Participants who reported changes in their usual respiratory symptoms throughout the year were included in the study. Per-patient and per-event analyses were performed. Participants (n=316, age 58±10 years, 53% female) reported 797 events of changes in their usual respiratory symptoms in 1 year.

A reduced or defective production leads to a loss of anti-inflammatory function, protease-antiprotease imbalance and cellular engorgement due to polymers deposition, with system-wide repercussions. This review aims to evaluate AATD condition in the major vessels of the head and neck, thoracic and abdominal districts. Also, a dedicated focus on autoimmune vascular diseases will be provided. A critical revision of the main literature findings starting from the 1980s until now has been performed. Studies conducted over the years have provided several contradictory pieces of evidence. Most authors acknowledge the protective and anti-inflammatory AAT role on the vascular endothelium. However, correlations between AATD and major arteries, cerebral and cardiovascular conditions, and autoimmune diseases remain unclear. Most studies recognize the role of AATD in vascular diseases but only as a cofactor inducing cellular and tissue structure impairments. However, this condition alone is not enough to determine new disease onset. Due to the opposing results reported over the years, there is still a considerable lack of knowledge on the role covered by AATD in vascular diseases. A renewed interest in this research field should be encouraged to grant new solid evidence and validate the putative role of AATD screening and replacement therapy as useful diagnostic and treatment tools."

    "title": "Correlation of alpha-1 antitrypsin levels and exosome associated neutrophil elastase endothelial injury in subjects with SARS-CoV2 infection.",
    "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by a novel coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has infected more than 18 million people worldwide. The activation of endothelial cells is a hallmark of signs of SARS-CoV-2 infection that includes altered integrity of vessel barrier and endothelial inflammation. Pulmonary endothelial activation is suggested to be related to the profound neutrophil elastase (NE) activity, which is necessary for sterilization of phagocytosed bacterial pathogens. However, unopposed activity of NE increases alveolocapillary permeability and extracellular matrix degradation. The uncontrolled protease activity of NE during the inflammatory phase of lung diseases might be due to the resistance of exosome associated NE to inhibition by alpha-1 antitrypsin. 31 subjects with a diagnosis of SARS-CoV2 infection were recruited in the disease group and samples from 30 voluntaries matched for age and sex were also collected for control. We measured the plasma levels of exosome-associated NE in SARS-CoV-2 patients which, were positively correlated with sign of endothelial damage in those patients as determined by plasma levels of LDH. Notably, we also found strong correlation with plasma levels of alpha-1 antitrypsin and exosome-associated NE in SARS-CoV-2 patients. Using macrovascular endothelial cells, we also observed that purified NE activity is inhibited by purified alpha-1 antitrypsin while, NE associated with exosomes are resistant to inhibition and show less sensitivity to alpha-1 antitrypsin inhibitory activity, in vitro. Our results point out the role of exosome-associated NE in exacerbation of endothelial injury in SARS-CoV-2 infection. We have demonstrated that exosome-associated NE could be served as a new potential therapeutic target of severe systemic manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection."

    "title": "Improving the Laboratory Diagnosis of M-like Variants Related to Alpha1-Antitrypsin Deficiency.",
    "abstract": "Alpha1-antitrypsin (AAT) is a serine protease inhibitor that is encoded by the highly polymorphic <i>SERPINA1</i> gene. Mutations in this gene can lead to AAT deficiency (AATD), which is associated with an increased risk of lung and/or liver disease. On the basis of electrophoretic migration, AAT variants are named with capital letters; M (medium) signifies the normal protein. Among pathological variants, the M-like ones represent a heterogeneous group of rare allelic variants that exhibit the same electrophoretic pattern as the M wild-type protein, which makes them difficult to detect with routine methods. In order to avoid their misdiagnosis, the present study defines and validates effective methods for the detection of two pathogenic M-like variants, M<sub>wurzburg</sub> and M<sub>whitstable</sub>. Comparison of protein phenotypes using isoelectric focusing of samples that presented the M<sub>wurzburg</sub> variant, as revealed by exons 5 sequencing, identified a particular electrophoretic pattern amenable to the M<sub>wurzburg</sub> protein. The specific phenotyping pattern was retrospectively validated, thus enabling the detection of 16 patients with M<sub>wurzburg</sub> variant among the subjects already tested but not sequenced according to our diagnostic algorithm. The M<sub>whitstable</sub> allele was detected by intron 4 sequencing of SERPINA1 gene. M<sub>wurzburg</sub> and M<sub>whitstable</sub> are often misdiagnosed and the introduction of diagnostic improvements can help the clinical management, especially in patients with established lung disease without any other reported risk factors."

    "abstract": "The aim of this cross-sectional study was to assess the state of disease at the time of diagnosis in Danish children with α 1 -antitrypsin deficiency as Denmark has a high prevalence of ZZ-homozygosity. Children either heterozygous, compound heterozygous, or homozygous for Z- and S-variants in the SERPINA1 -gene were included. Clinical characteristics, SERPINA1 -genotype, and blood serum (S) concentrations were recorded concurrently with genetic testing. Serum liver marker concentrations were compared using T tests and Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney tests. Generalized estimating equation (GEE) linear regression models, both univariable and multivariable adjusted for age and sex, were applied to identify correlations with serum α 1 -antitrypsin (S-AAT). The relationship between S-AAT concentration and genotype was assessed using logistic regression with GEE. The study included 183 of 225 children genetically tested for alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency (AATD). Of these, 36.6% were homozygous for the Z-variant. Of the heterozygotes, 89.7% had a ZM genotype and the remaining had either an MS genotype or were compound heterozygous. At diagnosis, ZZ-homozygous children had higher serum concentrations of liver enzymes and conjugated bilirubin, but lower concentrations of S-AAT compared with heterozygotes. Serum concentrations of conjugated bilirubin and liver enzymes were negatively associated with S-AAT. Children under 6 months of age had higher total S-bilirubin concentrations than children over 6 months of age. A low S-AAT concentration is a strong indicator of homozygosity, and homozygous children have higher enzymatic and cholestatic parameters compared with heterozygous children at diagnosis. This underlines the importance of measuring the S-AAT concentration in children with prolonged neonatal jaundice."

A targeted enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based panel of nine biomarkers (lysyl oxidase, tissue inhibitor matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 1, connective tissue growth factor [CTGF], IL-8, endoglin, periostin, Mac-2-binding protein, MMP-3, and MMP-7) was examined in children with biliary atresia (BA; n = 187), alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (A1AT; n = 78), and Alagille syndrome (ALGS; n = 65) and correlated with liver stiffness (LSM) and biochemical measures of liver disease. Median age and LSM were 9 years and 9.5 kPa. After adjusting for covariates, there were positive correlations among LSM and endoglin ( p = 0.04) and IL-8 ( p < 0.001) and MMP-7 ( p < 0.001) in participants with BA. The best prediction model for LSM in BA using clinical and lab measurements had an R2 = 0.437; adding IL-8 and MMP-7 improved R2 to 0.523 and 0.526 (both p < 0.0001). In participants with A1AT, CTGF and LSM were negatively correlated ( p = 0.004); adding CTGF to an LSM prediction model improved R2 from 0.524 to 0.577 ( p = 0.0033). Biomarkers did not correlate with LSM in ALGS. A significant number of biomarker/lab correlations were found in participants with BA but not those with A1AT or ALGS. Endoglin, IL-8, and MMP-7 significantly correlate with increased LSM in children with BA, whereas CTGF inversely correlates with LSM in participants with A1AT; these biomarkers appear to enhance prediction of LSM beyond clinical tests. Future disease-specific investigations of change in these biomarkers over time and as predictors of clinical outcomes will be important."

    "title": "Cigarette smoke exposed airway epithelial cell-derived EVs promote pro-inflammatory macrophage activation in alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency.",
    "abstract": "Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a genetic disorder most commonly secondary to a single mutation in the SERPINA1 gene (PI*Z) that causes misfolding and accumulation of alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) in hepatocytes and mononuclear phagocytes which reduces plasma AAT and creates a toxic gain of function. This toxic gain of function promotes a pro-inflammatory phenotype in macrophages that contributes to lung inflammation and early-onset COPD, especially in individuals who smoke cigarettes. The aim of this study is to determine the role of cigarette exposed AATD macrophages and bronchial epithelial cells in AATD-mediated lung inflammation. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from AATD and healthy individuals were differentiated into alveolar-like macrophages and exposed to air or cigarette smoke while in culture. Macrophage endoplasmic reticulum stress was quantified and secreted cytokines were measured using qPCR and cytokine ELISAs. To determine whether there is \"cross talk\" between epithelial cells and macrophages, macrophages were exposed to extracellular vesicles released by airway epithelial cells exposed to cigarette smoke and their inflammatory response was determined. AATD macrophages spontaneously produce several-fold more pro-inflammatory cytokines as compared to normal macrophages. AATD macrophages have an enhanced inflammatory response when exposed to cigarette smoke-induced extracellular vesicles (EVs) released from airway epithelial cells. Cigarette smoke-induced EVs induce expression of GM-CSF and IL-8 in AATD macrophages but have no effect on normal macrophages. Release of AAT polymers, potent neutrophil chemo attractants, were also increased from AATD macrophages after exposure to cigarette smoke-induced EVs. The expression of mutated AAT confers an inflammatory phenotype in AATD macrophages which disposes them to an exaggerated inflammatory response to cigarette smoke-induced EVs, and thus could contribute to progressive lung inflammation and damage in AATD individuals."

    "title": "Keratin 8 is a scaffolding and regulatory protein of ERAD complexes.",
    "abstract": "Early recognition and enhanced degradation of misfolded proteins by the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) quality control and ER-associated degradation (ERAD) cause defective protein secretion and membrane targeting, as exemplified for Z-alpha-1-antitrypsin (Z-A1AT), responsible for alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency (A1ATD) and F508del-CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) responsible for cystic fibrosis (CF). Prompted by our previous observation that decreasing Keratin 8 (K8) expression increased trafficking of F508del-CFTR to the plasma membrane, we investigated whether K8 impacts trafficking of soluble misfolded Z-A1AT protein. The subsequent goal of this study was to elucidate the mechanism underlying the K8-dependent regulation of protein trafficking, focusing on the ERAD pathway. The results show that diminishing K8 concentration in HeLa cells enhances secretion of both Z-A1AT and wild-type (WT) A1AT with a 13-fold and fourfold increase, respectively. K8 down-regulation triggers ER failure and cellular apoptosis when ER stress is jointly elicited by conditional expression of the µ<sub>s</sub> heavy chains, as previously shown for Hrd1 knock-out. Simultaneous K8 silencing and Hrd1 knock-out did not show any synergistic effect, consistent with K8 acting in the Hrd1-governed ERAD step. Fractionation and co-immunoprecipitation experiments reveal that K8 is recruited to ERAD complexes containing Derlin2, Sel1 and Hrd1 proteins upon expression of Z/WT-A1AT and F508del-CFTR. Treatment of the cells with c407, a small molecule inhibiting K8 interaction, decreases K8 and Derlin2 recruitment to high-order ERAD complexes. This was associated with increased Z-A1AT secretion in both HeLa and Z-homozygous A1ATD patients' respiratory cells. Overall, we provide evidence that K8 acts as an ERAD modulator. It may play a scaffolding protein role for early-stage ERAD complexes, regulating Hrd1-governed retrotranslocation initiation/ubiquitination processes. Targeting K8-containing ERAD complexes is an attractive strategy for the pharmacotherapy of A1ATD."

Systemic trough levels of A1PI in plasma or serum are widely accepted as a biochemical efficacy endpoint in clinical trials for A1PI products. Retrospective analyses utilizing data from three clinical studies in patients with AATD were conducted to evaluate the pharmacokinetic(s) (PK) and biochemical efficacy comparability of Aralast NP and two other A1PI augmentation therapies, Aralast and Prolastin. All three A1PI products were administered as either single or multiple 60 mg/kg intravenous infusions. PK and biochemical efficacy comparability analyses were conducted by evaluating antigenic and functional A1PI serum or plasma concentration data from each of the three studies. Comparable PK parameters were demonstrated between the three products for antigenic A1PI levels following a single infusion, with baseline-corrected and uncorrected geometric mean ratios for peak and systemic exposure ranging from 89.0% to 99.6%, with 90% confidence intervals within the 80-125% reference interval for bioequivalence. Biochemical efficacy comparability analyses of Aralast and Prolastin after multiple infusions at steady state showed geometric mean ratios for uncorrected and baseline-corrected antigenic and functional A1PI trough concentrations over weeks 8-11, and for individual weeks, that ranged from 75.8% to 106.6%, with the majority of the 90% confidence intervals falling either within the 80-125% interval or in proximity to it. Nonparametric superpositioning at steady state suggested that predicted trough concentrations for Aralast NP were comparable to the observed concentrations for Aralast and Prolastin. These retrospective analyses provide robust evidence that Aralast NP has biochemical efficacy and PK comparable to that of Aralast and Prolastin, supporting the use of any of these A1PI products for the treatment of patients with AATD.

    "abstract": "Alpha 1 antitrypsin (A1AT) is the major human blood serine protease inhibitor. Transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), which is crucial for SARS-CoV-2 cell entry, is inhibited by A1AT. Therefore, we hypothesized that individuals with diminished levels of A1AT may be more prone to SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19 disease. Our aim in this study was to evaluate the level of A1AT in hospitalized COVID-19 patients in comparison to hospitalized patients with non-COVID-19 pneumonia. We conducted an observational prospective study between October 2020 and April 2021 in Rabin Medical Centre in Israel. A1AT levels were measured from the routine serum samples of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 pneumonia (control group). The primary outcome was A1AT level, secondary outcomes were clinical outcomes and predictors of morality. Overall, 145 patients were included in the study, 98 in the COVID-19 group and 47 in the control group. The median A1AT level was 222 mg/dL (interquartile range (IQR) 188-269) and 258 mg/dL (IQR 210-281) in the COVID-19 and control groups, respectively (<i>p</i> = .045). Multivariate analysis for independent risk factors for mortality among COVID-19 patients showed that diabetes mellitus (<i>p</i> = .02), older age (<i>p</i> = .04), and high A1AT levels (<i>p</i> = .04) were all associated with increased mortality. Patients admitted due to severe COVID-19 had lower A1AT levels in comparison to patients admitted due to non-COVID pneumonia. This observation may suggest an association between mildly diminished A1AT and higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection with severe COVID-19 disease."

This was a multi-center, open-label extension (OLE) study that enrolled adult patients with AATD, who had completed the preceding safety and PK clinical trial. Patients were administered with Alpha-1 MP (60 mg/kg) weekly, for 52 weeks, and this could be renewed annually. Alpha1-MP trough levels (C<sub>min</sub>) were evaluated, and safety endpoints include: treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), TEAEs potentially related to Alpha-1 MP, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations, laboratory parameters, vital signs, and pulmonary function tests (forced expiration volume in 1 s [FEV<sub>1</sub>] and forced vital capacity [FVC]). Four patients underwent Alpha-1 MP intravenous infusions at a mean (SD) of 210.8 (9.54) for 213 weeks (four years), with a C<sub>min</sub> of 55.73 (4.99) mg/dL. A total of fifty-four TEAEs were reported in four patients, in which most of them were mild (n = 52, 96.3%). Two patients had five SAEs, and all were unrelated to treatment. Three mild TEAEs were potentially related to treatment with Alpha-1 MP. No clinically significant findings in laboratory parameters, COPD exacerbations, or vital signs were observed. There were no identifiable differences in FEV<sub>1</sub> and FVC throughout the study period. Long-term weekly intravenous infusions of 60 mg/kg Alpha-1 MP are generally safe and well-tolerated in Japanese patients with AATD. GOV: NCT02870348; JAPIC CTI: JapicCTI-163194."

    "abstract": "α-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency, a major risk factor for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, is one of the most prevalent and fatal hereditary diseases. The rising demand of AAT poses a defined need for new processes of AAT manufacturing from recombinant sources. Commercial affinity adsorbents for AAT purification present the intrinsic limitations of protein ligands - chiefly, the high cost and the lability towards the proteases in the feedstocks and the cleaning-in-place utilized in biomanufacturing - which limit their application despite their high capacity and selectivity. This work presents the development of small peptide affinity ligands for the purification of AAT from Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell culture harvests. An ensemble of ligand candidates identified via library screening were conjugated on Toyopearl resin and evaluated via experimental and in silico AAT-binding studies. Initial ranking based on equilibrium binding capacity indicated WHAKKSKFG- (12.9 mg of AAT per mL of resin), WHAKKSHFG- (16.3 mg/mL), and KWKHSHKWG- (15.8 mg/mL) Toyopearl resins as top performing adsorbents. Notably, the fitting of adsorption data to Langmuir isotherms concurred with molecular docking and dynamics in returning values of dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) between 1 - 10 µM. These peptide-based adsorbents were thus selected for AAT purification from CHO fluids, affording values of AAT binding capacity up to 13 gram per liter of resin, and product yield and purity up to 77% and 97%. WHAKKSHFG-Toyopearl resin maintained its purification activity upon 20 consecutive uses, demonstrating its potential for AAT manufacturing from recombinant sources."

On the other hand, auto-immunity process could also facilitate the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes mellitus importantly. Concerning on this notion, the anti-inflammatory therapeutic strategy is demonstrated to embrace an essential function in those cardio-metabolic disorders in clinical practice. The α-1 anti-trypsin, also named Serpin-A1 and as an acute phase endogenous protein, has been verified to have several modulatory effects such as anti-inflammatory response, anti-apoptosis, and immunomodulatory functions. In addition, it is also used for therapeutic strategy of a rare genetic disease caused by the deficiency of α-1 anti-trypsin. Recent emerging evidence has indicated that the serum concentrations of α-1 anti-trypsin levels and its biological activity are significantly changed in those inflammatory and immune related cardio-metabolic disorder diseases. Nevertheless, the underlying mechanism is still not elucidated. In the current review, the basic experiments and clinical trials which provided the evidence revealing the potential therapeutic function of the α-1 anti-trypsin in cardio-metabolic disorder diseases were well-summarized. Furthermore, the results which indicated that the α-1 anti-trypsin presented the possibility as a novel serum biomarker in humans to predict those cardio-metabolic disorder diseases were also elucidated."

    "abstract": "Heterologous expression of proteins is used widely for the biosynthesis of biologics, many of which are secreted from cells. In addition, gene therapy and messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines frequently direct the expression of secretory proteins to nonnative host cells. Consequently, it is crucial to understand the maturation and trafficking of proteins in a range of host cells including muscle cells, a popular therapeutic target due to the ease of accessibility by intramuscular injection. Here, we analyzed the production efficiency for α1-antitrypsin (AAT) in Chinese hamster ovary cells, commonly used for biotherapeutic production, and myoblasts (embryonic progenitor cells of muscle cells) and compared it to the production in the major natural cells, liver hepatocytes. AAT is a target protein for gene therapy to address pathologies associated with insufficiencies in native AAT activity or production. AAT secretion and maturation were most efficient in hepatocytes. Myoblasts were the poorest of the cell types tested; however, secretion of active AAT was significantly augmented in myoblasts by treatment with the proteostasis regulator suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid, a histone deacetylase inhibitor. These findings were extended and validated in myotubes (mature muscle cells) where AAT was transduced using an adeno-associated viral capsid transduction method used in gene therapy clinical trials. Overall, our study sheds light on a possible mechanism to enhance the efficacy of gene therapy approaches for AAT and, moreover, may have implications for the production of proteins from mRNA vaccines, which rely on the expression of viral glycoproteins in nonnative host cells upon intramuscular injection."

We collected patient demographic and lesion morphologic characteristics using lesion photographs and physician notes for each of our 207 cases, including location, ulceration, scale, pattern (unilateral versus circumferential), atrophy/sclerosis (cicatricial), redness, and swelling. The panniculitides most likely to ulcerate were calciphylaxis (85.7% ulcerating), pancreatic panniculitis (66.6%), and α<sub>1</sub>-antitrypsin deficiency-associated panniculitis (100%). The panniculitides least likely to ulcerate were erythema nodosum and medication-induced and granulomatous panniculitis. This retrospective study used only descriptions in clinical notes and available medical photographs. We present an updated classification schema of panniculitides based on clinical findings. The primary distinctions are based on ulceration, location, and number of lesions. Although complete distinction of all panniculitides based on clinical examination alone is not possible, we hope the proposed schema allows clinicians to tailor differential diagnoses."

    "title": "Expert Perspectives on the Management of Alpha 1-Antitrypsin Deficiency.",
    "abstract": "Alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency is an inherited autosomal codominant disorder, which predisposes patients to lung and/or liver disease. Even though it is considered rare, it is one of the most frequent genetic disorders worldwide, albeit remaining underdiagnosed. Several organizations and societies, including the Portuguese Society of Pulmonology have been elaborating guidelines and recommendations for the diagnosis and management of alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency. Nevertheless, some important matters are yet to be included in those, mainly due to lack of robust scientific evidence, and continue to represent a point of discussion. This article reviews some important scientific publications and expresses the perspectives of a group of Portuguese experts regarding the management of alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency, namely in terms of the pre and neonatal diagnosis, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the validity of replacement therapy in lung transplant-receiving, and finally, alternative strategies of alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency treatment to improve the patients' quality of life."

    "abstract": "A rare clinical syndrome, giant bullous emphysema, also known by the name of vanishing lung syndrome (VLS), is characterized by an X-ray of the chest showing disappearance of the lung. VLS is a chronic disease that progresses gradually and is usually seen in young male smokers, with other risk factors being alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency and marijuana abuse. Giant emphysematous bullae are a pathognomonic presentation with a preference towards the upper lobe of the lungs. These emphysematous bullae may remain dormant for a long duration before presenting as worsening dyspnoea. Computed tomography is an essential tool to diagnose VLS. The treatment modalities include surgical and thoracoscopic resection of the bullae. We have reported a rare case of VLS in a 58-year-old chronic smoker managed conservatively."

    "abstract": "It is well recognized that chronic low-grade systemic inflammation and autoimmunity contribute to the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome, its associated diseases (e.g. type 2 diabetes, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease) and type 1 diabetes, respectively. Consequently, anti-inflammatory agents might play a role in managing these immune associated metabolic diseases. Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT), an endogenous acute phase protein being used for treatment of AAT deficiency (a rare genetic disease), has multiple functions including anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, anti-apoptosis and cytoprotective effects. In this review, we summarized basic and clinical studies that reported potential therapeutic role of AAT in metabolic syndrome associated diseases and type 1 diabetes. Studies that demonstrated AAT had the possibility to be used as a novel biomarker to predict these immune associated metabolic diseases were also included."

    "abstract": "Subjective cognitive difficulties are common among sarcoidosis patients; however, previous studies have not modeled the link between cognitive difficulties and health-related quality of life (HRQOL). To determine whether cognitive difficulties are associated with HRQOL in sarcoidosis patients after adjusting for demographics, fatigue, and physical disease severity measures. We performed a secondary analysis of the Genomic Research in Alpha-1 antitrypsin Deficiency and Sarcoidosis (GRADS) study data. We examined the association between self-reported cognitive difficulties (Cognitive Failures Questionnaire (CFQ)) and HRQOL (SF12v2 mental and physical component scores) while adjusting for the demographics, fatigue, and physical disease severity measures (i.e., organ involvement, forced vital capacity). Approximately one-fourth of the patients with sarcoidosis endorsed cognitive difficulties. More frequent cognitive difficulties and more severe fatigue were significantly associated with worse mental HRQOL in the fully adjusted model, while older age was associated with better mental HRQOL. The association between cognitive difficulties and physical HRQOL was not significant in the final model. More severe fatigue, joint involvement, and reduced forced vital capacity (FVC) were associated with worse physical HRQOL, while higher income and higher education were associated with better physical HRQOL. Perceived cognitive difficulties are associated with diminished HRQOL after adjusting for demographics, organ involvement, pulmonary function, and fatigue. The association between cognitive difficulties and reduced HRQOL primarily occurs through the impact on mental components of HRQOL."

    "abstract": "Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1 (CMT1A) is a hereditary peripheral neuropathy for which there is no available therapy. Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) is an abundant serine protease inhibitor with anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating properties. Here, we tested whether treatment with human AAT (hAAT) would have a therapeutic effect on CMT1A in a <i>PMP22</i> transgenic mouse model. Our results show that hAAT significantly improved compound muscle action potential and histopathological features and decreased circulating IL-6 in CMT1A mice. We also investigated some of the possible underlying mechanisms in vitro. We confirmed that hAAT inhibits ADAM-17, a protease that has been implicated in blocking myelination. Furthermore, both hAAT and recombinant human AAT (rhAAT) were able to attenuate the activation of a macrophage/microglia cell line, markedly decreasing the activation of the MHC class II promoter and the expression of pro-inflammatory genes such as <i>IL-1β</i> and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress marker <i>ATF3</i>. Taken together, our results demonstrate for the first time that hAAT is able to reduce the progression of CMT1A, possibly by dampening inflammation and by regulating ADAM-17. Given the already well-established safety profile of hAAT, specifically in AAT deficiency disease (AATD), we suggest that the findings of our study should be promptly investigated in CMT1A patients."

Its primary function is to inhibit the activity of a series of proteases, including proteinase 3, neutrophil elastase, metalloproteases, and cysteine-aspartate proteases. In addition, A1AT also has anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, anti-oxidative stress, anti-viral, and anti-bacterial activities and plays essential roles in the regulation of tissue repair and lymphocyte differentiation and activation. The overactivation of the immune system characterizes the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases.

It is important to recognize risk factors that contribute to disease progression and liver transplantation. We aimed to assess if age, sex, or smoking status was associated with liver or lung disease progression. Forty-three patients with ZZ-AATD cirrhosis were consecutively sampled from an Institutional Review Board-approved registry of 240 patients with AATD of any genotype seen as outpatients in the Cleveland Clinic between 1999 and 2019. To determine the association between risk factors and lung or liver disease progression, linear mixed-effects models with fixed effects for linear time, risk factor, and time-by-risk factor interaction, and the random intercepts for intra-patient correlation were used. Based on the mixed-effects model analysis, there was a significant association between liver disease progression and smoking history, and no association with age or sex. There was no association between lung disease progression and age, sex, or smoking history. However, smoking history was significantly associated with lower forced expiratory volume values. This study found that in a cohort of patients with PI*ZZ genotype AATD (ZZ-AATD) and cirrhosis, smoking history was associated with liver disease progression, whereas age and sex were not."

The aim of the study was to evaluate the distribution of the clinical manifestations of severe and intermediate genetic AATD in the geographic area around Parma in Northern Italy. 238 subjects were submitted to molecular analysis of the SERPINA1 gene, and data on anthropometric variables, smoking habits, number of packs per year, AAT serum concentration, and clinical manifestations were recorded and presented as mean ± SD or median values (1st quartile; 3rd quartile). The results show a distribution of genetic AATD of 4.1% of the screened population in the area encompassing the city of Parma. PI*MS and PI*MZ were the most common genotypes at 40.9% and 28.2% of the population with genetic AATD, and asthma and emphysema were the most represented clinical manifestations.

In our study setting, the estimated prevalence rates of mild (PI*MZ, PI*SS or PI*MS) and moderate-to-severe AATD (PI*ZZ or PI*SZ) are high, 9% and 0.2%, respectively. Our primary aim was to examine the prevalence rate of AATD among hospitalized COVID-19-patients. In this prospective observational study, enrollment occurred from December 2020 to January 2021 in two COVID-19-units at Skåne University Hospital, Lund, Sweden. Case definition was a patient hospitalized due to COVID-19. Patients were screened for AATD with PI-typing and if results were inconclusive, PCR for the S- and Z-genes were performed. Patients were categorized as severe or moderate COVID-19 and 30-day-mortality data were collected. The primary outcome was prevalence rate of AATD. The secondary outcome investigated association between presence of mild AATD and severe COVID-19. We enrolled 61 patients with COVID-19. Two patients out of 61 (3%) had mild AATD (PI*MZ) and none had moderate-to-severe AATD. 30/61 (49%) had severe COVID-19. Both patients with mild AATD developed severe COVID-19. Yet, presence of AATD was not significantly associated with severe COVID-19 (p=0.24).

Few reports of multiplex families with JIA were published until now. The aim of this study was to describe the subjects affected by juvenile idiopathic arthritis and psoriatic features (JIAPs) in a large family. Here, we characterized an extended multiplex family of 5 patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis and psoriatic features (PsA) at the clinical and genetic level, using whole exome sequencing. We did not confirm in our family the linkage with the genetic factors already described that might be associated with increase susceptibility to JIA. We found a carrier status of siblings who inherited a pathogenic allele of the SERPINA1 gene from their mother who herself has two heterozygous pathogenic variants in the SERPINA1 gene. This study didn't identify genetic contributive factors but highlights potentially environmental associations concerning the siblings of a family with juvenile idiopathic arthritis and psoriatic features (JIAPs). It is difficult to establish that SERPINA1 gene mutation has an etiological role as the levels of AAT are only slightly decreased and all the children harbor heterozygous variants."

The Z allele produces a mutant AAT protein called Z-AAT, which accumulates in hepatocytes and can lead to progressive liver disease and fibrosis. This open-label, phase 2 trial investigated the safety and efficacy of fazirsiran, an RNA interference therapeutic, in patients with liver disease associated with AAT deficiency. We assigned adults with the PI ZZ genotype and liver fibrosis to receive fazirsiran at a dose of 200 mg (cohorts 1 [4 patients] and 2 [8 patients]) or 100 mg (cohort 1b [4 patients]) subcutaneously on day 1 and week 4 and then every 12 weeks. The primary end point was the change from baseline to week 24 (cohorts 1 and 1b) or week 48 (cohort 2) in liver Z-AAT concentrations, which were measured by means of liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. All the patients had reduced accumulation of Z-AAT in the liver (median reduction, 83% at week 24 or 48). The nadir in serum was a reduction of approximately 90%, and treatment was also associated with a reduction in histologic globule burden (from a mean score of 7.4 [scores range from 0 to 9, with higher scores indicating a greater globule burden] at baseline to 2.3 at week 24 or 48). All cohorts had reductions in liver enzyme concentrations. Fibrosis regression was observed in 7 of 15 patients and fibrosis progression in 2 of 15 patients after 24 or 48 weeks. There were no adverse events leading to trial or drug discontinuation. Four serious adverse events (viral myocarditis, diverticulitis, dyspnea, and vestibular neuronitis) resolved. In this small trial, fazirsiran was associated with a strong reduction of Z-AAT concentrations in the serum and liver and concurrent improvements in liver enzyme concentrations.

    "abstract": "α-1 antitrypsin (AAT) is a serine protease inhibitor that plays a pivotal role in maintaining lung homeostasis. The most common AAT allele associated with AAT deficiency (AATD) is PiZ. Z-AAT accumulates in cells due to misfolding, causing severe AATD. The major function of AAT is to neutralize neutrophil elastase in the lung. It is generally accepted that loss of antiprotease function is a major cause of COPD in individuals with AATD. However, it is now being recognized that the toxic gain-of-function effect of Z-AAT in macrophage likely contributes to lung disease. In the present study, we determined that TLR7 signaling is activated in Z-MDMs, and the expression level of NLRP3, one of the targets of TLR7 signaling, is significantly higher in Z- compared with M-MDMs. We also determined that the level of endosomal Alu RNA is significantly higher in Z-compared with M-MDMs. Alu RNA is a known endogenous ligand that activates TLR7 signaling. Z-AAT likely induces the expression of Alu elements in MDMs and accelerates monocyte death, leading to the higher level of endosomal Alu RNA in Z-MDMs. Taken together,this study identifies a mechanism responsible for the toxic gain of function of Z-AAT macrophages."

    "abstract": "In March 2021, a 19-item survey was sent to 420 patients with AATD who were being treated with AAT replacement therapy (prolastin) and who participated in the German AlphaCare patient program. The majority of the respondents (55.9%; 138) had been diagnosed with AATD ≥10 years prior to the survey and most (93.5%; 231) felt adequately informed about their disease through their physician, AlphaCare and Alpha1 Deutschland. The majority of respondents were concerned/very concerned about acquiring COVID-19. Only 1.2% of the respondents reported having been infected with SARS-CoV-2, less than the infection rate in the general population at that time (3.4%). Almost all of the respondents fully agreed/agreed that they had restricted their social contacts due to the pandemic. A substantial percentage of the responding patients fully agreed/agreed that they were concerned about being infected with COVID-19 during a visit at their doctor's office or clinic. Regarding AAT augmentation therapy, only 18 respondents reported discontinuing therapy during the pandemic, but most of these discontinuations were short-term - one was permanent. These survey results suggest that AATD patients are well-informed about the risks of COVID-19 with their condition and practised self-protection measures. This may have resulted in an COVID-19 infection rate lower than the general population. Although respondents were concerned about exposure to COVID-19 in their doctor's office or clinic, very few discontinued therapy even temporarily."

    "abstract": "Pulmonary emphysema and liver disease are the clinical expressions of alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency, an autosomal recessive genetic disease. Alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency is usually associated with the homozygous Z variant of the SERPINA1 gene. Its clinical expression always consists in a substantial reduction of alpha 1-antitrypsin serum concentration and its variants are analyzed by isoelectric focalization or molecular techniques. Assessed by CO transfer alteration and CT scan, risk of pulmonary emphysema is increased by tobacco consumption. Assessed by transient elastography and liver ultrasound, risk of liver disease is increased by alcohol consumption or obesity. Treatment of COPD-associated alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency does not differ from that of other forms of COPD. In patients presenting with severe deficiency, augmentation therapy with plasma-derived alpha 1-antitrypsin reduces the progression of emphysema, as shown in terms of CT-based lung density metrics. Patients with alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency with a ZZ genotype should refrain from alcohol or tobacco consumption, and watch their weight; so should their close relatives. Modulation of alpha 1-antitrypsin liver production offers an interesting new therapeutic perspective. Homozygous (Z) variants of the SERPINA1 gene confer an increased risk of pulmonary emphysema and liver disease, particularly among smokers, drinkers and obese persons."

MicroRNAs have been identified as disease modifiers; therefore miRNA deregulation could play an important role in disease heterogeneity. Members of miR-320 family are involved in regulating of multiple processes including inflammation, and have potential specific binding sites in the 3'UTR region of SERPINA1 gene. In this study we explore the involvement of miR-320c, a member of this family, in this disease. Firstly in vitro studies were carried out to demonstrate regulation of SERPINA1 gene by miR-320. Furthermore, the expression of miR-320c was analyzed in the blood of 98 individuals with different AAT serum levels by using quantitative PCR and expression was correlated to clinical parameters of the patients. Finally, HL60 cells were used to analyze induction of miR-320c in inflammatory conditions. Overexpression of miR-320 members in human HepG2 cells led to inhibition of SERPINA1 expression. Analysis of miR-320c expression in patient's samples revealed significantly increased expression of miR-320c in individuals with pulmonary disease. Additionally, HL60 cells treated with the pro-inflammatory factor lipopolysaccharide (LPS) showed increase in miR-320c expression, suggesting that miR-320c responds to inflammation. Our findings demonstrate that miR-320c inhibits SERPINA1 expression in a hepatic cell line and its levels in blood are associated with lung disease in a cohort of patients with different AAT serum levels. These results suggest that miR-320c can play a role in AAT regulation and could be a biomarker of inflammatory processes in pulmonary diseases."

This was an observational, cross-sectional analysis of samples from patients with suspected AATD from March 2018 to January 2022. Samples were coded on a web platform and sent by post or courier to the central laboratory in Northern Spain. Allele-specific genotyping for the 14 most common mutations was carried out with the A1AT Genotyping Test (Progenika-Grifols, Spain). SERPINA1 gene sequencing was performed if none of the mutations were found or one variant was detected in heterozygous status and the AAT serum level was < 60 mg/dl, or if requested by the clinician in charge. The study included 30,827 samples: 30,458 (94.7%) with final results after direct genotyping and 369 (1.1%) with additional gene sequencing. Only 0.3% of the samples were not processed due to their poor quality. The prevalence of the most frequent allele combinations was MS 14.7%, MZ 8.6%, SS 1.9%, SZ 1.9%, and ZZ 0.9%. Additionally, 70 cases with new mutations were identified. Family screening was conducted in 2.5% of the samples. Samples from patients with respiratory diseases other than COPD, including poorly controlled asthma or bronchiectasis, also presented AATD mutations. Our results confirm the viability of this diagnostic system for genotyping AATD conducted simultaneously in different countries. The system has proved satisfactory and can improve the timely diagnosis of AATD."

World Health Organization (WHO) advice all COPD patients' AATD rate to be screened at least once during their life.The prevalence of AATD in the general population ranges from 1:2,000-5,000 in parts of Europe and from 1 to 5,000-10,000 in the United States and Canada. An 81-year-old male patient with COPD. In computed tomography (CT) of the thorax, mass in the right lower lobe and a nodule in the right upper lobe were detected. The biopsy from right bronchial entrance via fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FB) yielded squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). AAT level was 169 mg/dL (ref. range: 90-200 mg/dL). M/P lowell allele was detected in genetic analysis. A 45-year-old male patient with COPD. Conglomerated lymhadenomegaly in the paratracheal area was detected in CT. The biopsy from mucosal infiltrates initiating from the entrance of the right upper lobe to the anterior segment revealed SCC. His AAT level was 190 mg/dL (ref. range: 90-200 mg/dL) and the genetic analysis demonstrated M/I mutation. A 64-year-old male COPD patient. In thorax CT, a 24 mm diameter parenchymal nodule in the left lower lobe was detected. Transthoracic fine needle aspiration biopsy from the left lung nodule showed SCC. His AAT level was 196 mg/dL (ref. range: 90-200 mg/dL) and M/P lowell allele was detected in the genetic analysis. AAT deficiency can cause early-onset of COPD, manifested with emphysema and chronic bronchitis. It has been suggested that AATD is associated with an increased risk of many types of cancer. Although the relationship between AATD or variant carriage and LC histopathology is not clear in the literature, it was detected as squamous cell carcinoma in our cases. We infer that unmeasurable lung damage is more prevalent in heterozygous patients and we believe that sharing our results may draw more attention in this regard."

    "abstract": "Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency (AATD) is an inherited disease caused by mutations in the serpin family A member 1 (SERPINA1, also known as AAT) gene. The most common variant, PI*Z (Glu342Lys), causes accumulation of aberrantly folded AAT in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of hepatocytes that is associated with a toxic gain of function, hepatocellular injury, liver fibrosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. The unfolded protein response (UPR) is a cellular response to improperly folded proteins meant to alleviate ER stress. It has been unclear whether PI*Z AAT elicits liver cell UPR, due in part to limitations of current cellular and animal models. This study investigates whether UPR is activated in a novel human PI*Z AAT cell line and a new PI*Z human AAT (hAAT) mouse model. A PI*Z AAT hepatocyte cell line (Huh7.5Z) was established using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 gene editing of the normal ATT (PI*MM) gene in the Huh7.5 cell line. Additionally, novel full-length genomic DNA PI*Z hAAT and PI*M hAAT transgenic mouse models were established. Using these new models, UPR in Huh7.5Z cells and PI*Z mice were comprehensively determined. Robust activation of UPR was observed in Huh7.5Z cells compared to Huh7.5 cells. Activated caspase cascade and apoptosis markers, increased chaperones, and autophagy markers were also detected in Z hepatocytes. Selective attenuation of UPR signaling branches was observed in PI*Z hAAT mice in which the protein kinase R-like ER kinase and inositol-requiring enzyme1α branches were suppressed while the activating transcription factor 6α branch remained active. This study provides direct evidence that PI*Z AAT triggers canonical UPR and that hepatocytes survive pro-apoptotic UPR by selective suppression of UPR branches. Our data improve understanding of underlying pathological molecular mechanisms of PI*Z AATD liver disease."

There is currently no cure for this disorder, although repeated infusions of plasma-purified protein may slow down emphysema progression. Gene therapy in which a single recombinant adeno-associated viral vector (rAAV) administration would lead to sustained protein expression could therefore similarly affect disease progression, and provide the added benefits of reducing treatment burden and thereby improving the patient's quality of life. The study presented here tests whether treating the <i>Serpina1a-e</i> knockout mouse model of α<sub>1</sub>-antitrypsin-deficiency lung disease with gene therapy would have an impact on the disease course, either on spontaneous disease caused by aging or on accelerated disease caused by exposure to cigarette smoke. Liver-directed gene therapy led to dose-dependent levels of biologically active human α<sub>1</sub>-antitrypsin protein. Furthermore, decreased lung compliance and increased elastic recoil indicate that treated mice had largely preserved lung tissue elasticity and alveolar wall integrity compared with untreated mice. rAAV-mediated gene augmentation is therefore able to compensate for the loss of function and restore a beneficial lung protease-antiprotease balance.

While heterozygosity for Pi∗Z (Pi∗MZ) is linked to increased risk of cirrhosis, whether the Pi∗MZ genotype is associated with an increased rate of decompensation among patients who already have compensated cirrhosis is not known. This was a retrospective study of Michigan Genomics Initiative participants with baseline compensated cirrhosis. The primary predictors were Pi∗MZ or Pi∗MS genotype (<i>vs</i>. Pi∗MM). The primary outcomes were hepatic decompensation with ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, or variceal bleeding, or the combined endpoint of liver-related death or liver transplant, both modeled with Fine-Gray competing risk models. We included 576 patients with baseline compensated cirrhosis who had undergone genotyping, of whom 474 had Pi∗MM, 49 had Pi∗MZ, and 52 had Pi∗MS genotypes. Compared to Pi∗MM genotype, Pi∗MZ was associated with increased rates of hepatic decompensation (hazard ratio 1.81; 95% CI 1.22-2.69; <i>p =</i> 0.003) and liver transplant or liver-related death (hazard ratio 2.07; 95% CI 1.21-3.52; <i>p =</i> 0.078). These associations remained significant after adjustment for severity of underlying liver disease, and were robust across subgroup analyses based on etiology, sex, obesity, and diabetes status. Pi∗MS was not associated with decompensation or death/transplantation. The <i>SERPINA1</i> Pi∗MZ genotype is associated with an increased rate of hepatic decompensation and decreased transplant-free survival among patients with baseline compensated cirrhosis. There is a mutation in the gene <i>SERPINA1</i> called Pi∗MZ which increases risk of liver scarring (cirrhosis); however, it is not known what effect Pi∗MZ has if someone already has cirrhosis. In this study, we found that people who had cirrhosis and Pi∗MZ developed complications from cirrhosis faster than those who did not have the mutation."

    "title": "High-level production of wild-type and oxidation-resistant recombinant alpha-1-antitrypsin in glycoengineered CHO cells.",
    "abstract": "Alpha-1-antitrypsin (A1AT) is a serine protease inhibitor which blocks the activity of serum proteases including neutrophil elastase to protect the lungs. Its deficiency is known to increase the risk of pulmonary emphysema as well as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Currently, the only treatment for patients with A1AT deficiency is weekly injection of plasma-purified A1AT. There is still today no commercial source of therapeutic recombinant A1AT, likely due to significant differences in expression host-specific glycosylation profile and/or high costs associated with the huge therapeutic dose needed. Accordingly, we aimed to produce high levels of recombinant wild-type A1AT, as well as a mutated protein (mutein) version for increased oxidation resistance, with N-glycans analogous to human plasma-derived A1AT. To achieve this, we disrupted two endogenous glycosyltransferase genes controlling core α-1,6-fucosylation (Fut8) and α-2,3-sialylation (ST3Gal4) in CHO cells using CRISPR/Cas9 technology, followed by overexpression of human α-2,6-sialyltransferase (ST6Gal1) using a cumate-inducible expression system. Volumetric A1AT productivity obtained from stable CHO pools was 2.5- to 6.5-fold higher with the cumate-inducible CR5 promoter compared to five strong constitutive promoters. Using the CR5 promoter, glycoengineered stable CHO pools were able to produce over 2.1 and 2.8 g/L of wild-type and mutein forms of A1AT, respectively, with N-glycans analogous to the plasma-derived clinical product Prolastin-C. Supplementation of N-acetylmannosamine to the cell culture media during production increased the overall sialylation of A1AT as well as the proportion of bi-antennary and disialylated A2G2S2 N-glycans. These purified recombinant A1AT proteins showed in vitro inhibitory activity equivalent to Prolastin-C and substitution of methionine residues 351 and 358 with valines rendered A1AT significantly more resistant to oxidation. The recombinant A1AT mutein bearing an improved oxidation resistance described in this study could represent a viable biobetter drug, offering a safe and more stable alternative for augmentation therapy."

    "abstract": "Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is characterized by neutrophil-dominated inflammation resulting in emphysema. The cholesterol-rich neutrophil outer plasma membrane plays a central role in adhesion and subsequent transmigration to underlying tissues. This study aimed to investigate mechanisms of increased neutrophil adhesion in AATD and whether alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) augmentation therapy abrogates this effect. Plasma and blood neutrophils were donated by healthy controls (<i>n</i> = 20), AATD (<i>n</i> = 30), and AATD patients after AAT augmentation therapy (<i>n</i> = 6). Neutrophil membrane protein expression was investigated using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The effect of once-weekly intravenous AAT augmentation therapy was assessed by calcium fluorometric, μ-calpain, and cell adhesion assays. Decreased neutrophil plasma membrane cholesterol content (<i>P</i> = 0.03), yet increased abundance of integrin α-M (fold change 1.91), integrin α-L (fold change 3.76), and cytoskeletal adaptor proteins including talin-1 (fold change 4.04) were detected on AATD neutrophil plasma membrane fractions. The described inflammatory induced structural changes were a result of a more than twofold increased cytosolic calcium concentration (<i>P</i> = 0.02), leading to significant calcium-dependent μ-calpain activity (3.5-fold change; <i>P</i> = 0.005), resulting in proteolysis of the membrane cholesterol trafficking protein caveolin-1. Treatment of AAT-deficient individuals with AAT augmentation therapy resulted in increased caveolin-1 and membrane cholesterol content (111.8 ± 15.5 vs. 64.18 ± 7.8 μg/2 × 10<sup>7</sup> cells before and after treatment, respectively; <i>P</i> = 0.02), with concurrent decreased neutrophil integrin expression and adhesion. Results demonstrate an auxiliary benefit of AAT augmentation therapy, evident by a decrease in circulating inflammation and controlled neutrophil adhesion."

    "abstract": "This case report describes a child born with both cystic fibrosis (CF) and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (A1ATD). Both are autosomal recessive inherited diseases, mainly affecting the lungs and the liver. The combination of both diseases together is rare and may lead to a fulminant disease with limited life span. To the best of our knowledge, no case has been reported of a patient born with both diseases. After an uneventful pregnancy, a male baby was born with meconium ileus. The suspected diagnosis of CF was confirmed based on the sweat test and genetic analysis. The child developed persisting cholestasis, too severe to be likely caused by CF alone and indicating an associated problem. The diagnosis of A1ATD was established based on clinical suspicion (persisting cholestasis), decreased serum alpha-1 antitrypsin and genetic analysis. Supportive therapy was started, however the boy evolved to rapidly progressive liver disease leading to liver failure which necessitated an infant liver transplantation. This case illustrates the complexity of care in case of two severe inherited diseases as well as post solid organ transplant care."

    "abstract": "A 53-year old female patient with history of hypocomplementaemic urticarial vasculitis syndrome (HUVS) and polyarteritis nodosa presented with progressive dyspnoea on exertion due to emphysema. Lung function revealed a severe obstructive ventilator disorder with a forced expiratory volume in 1 second of 22% of predicted, and a significant hyperinflation with a residual volume of 321% of predicted. Multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) scan and quantitative CT analysis (StratX software) confirmed a lower lobe predominant emphysema. Considering the young age, the very severely impaired lung function, the relatively low nicotine abuse, the exclusion of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, together with the known diagnosis of HUVS, the emphysema was more likely due to the vasculitis than to a typical chronic obstructive lung disease. MDCT scan showed that particularly the segment 8 of the right lower lobe was severely emphysematous destroyed and hyperinflated. Invasive Chartis® measurement revealed no significant collateral ventilation of the isolated segment 8 of the right lower lobe, so that an endobronchial valve placement was performed. Three months following intervention, the MDCT scan revealed a complete collapse of the segment 8 on the right, which was associated with a significant clinical benefit and a mild reduction of the hyperinflation in the lung function test."

    "abstract": "α1-antitrypsin (AAT) is an acute-phase protein that functions as an inhibitor of serine proteases, such as neutrophil elastase. A significant body of evidence shows that AAT has a pivotal role in protecting tissues from neutrophil-induced damage, preserving endothelial function, and improving outcomes of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, though the mechanism of its activity is not fully elucidated. In terms of several significant anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties, AAT's capacity to inhibit elastase has been determined to be non-essential. With the discovery of a role for diverse binding partners in AAT biology, it is intriguing to learn that AAT attaches to cholesterol, fatty acids, lipid rafts, and lipoproteins and conformational changes in its hydrophobic binding site affect its activity. The complex formation of fatty acids or lipoproteins with native or modified AAT impacts its protease inhibitory action as well as its anti-inflammatory properties. As such, AAT-enriched HDL particles exhibit improved anti-inflammatory action. These findings contribute to our understanding of AAT's mechanism of action and may provide a fresh platform for investigating the therapeutic significance of AAT therapy in an informed manner outside of genetic AAT deficiency."

    "abstract": "Patients with severe alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) are at increased risk for the development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), particularly if they smoke. This, coupled with their predilection for dysregulated inflammation and autoimmunity, makes affected individuals priority candidates for vaccination against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). To promote vaccine uptake effectively, an understanding of the factors motivating people to proceed with vaccination is essential. The attitudes of patients with AATD towards COVID-19 vaccination have yet to be described. We prospectively studied 170 Pi*ZZ genotype AATD patients, 150 patients with nonhereditary (Pi*MM genotype) COPD and 140 Pi*MM genotype individuals without lung disease receiving first-dose vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AstraZeneca). Patient attitudes towards vaccination and motivations for getting vaccinated were assessed at the time of the vaccine being offered. Following completion of the 2-dose vaccine series, Pi*ZZ patients were then re-assessed regarding their attitudes towards booster vaccination. The most common primary motivation for accepting vaccination in Pi*ZZ participants ≥50 years old was a fear of illness or death from COVID-19. In contrast, Pi*ZZ patients <50 years most often cited a desire to socialize. The motivation pattern of younger Pi*ZZ AATD patients was similar to that of non-deficient individuals of comparable age, whereas older Pi*ZZ individuals were more closely aligned with Pi*MM COPD and differed from age-matched controls without lung disease. When considering booster vaccination, Pi*ZZ patients were increasingly motivated by a desire to reacquire social freedoms. A desire to reduce the risk of transmission was not a prominent consideration in any of the groups studied. The most commonly cited reason for booster hesitancy was a lack of incentive, given that no additional social freedoms were available to triple-vaccinated individuals compared to those who were double-vaccinated at the time. Taken together, these data may inform policymakers attempting to promote vaccine uptake among patients with AATD."

    "abstract": "Misfolding of secretory proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) features in many human diseases. In α<sub>1</sub>-antitrypsin deficiency, the pathogenic Z variant aberrantly assembles into polymers in the hepatocyte ER, leading to cirrhosis. We show that α<sub>1</sub>-antitrypsin polymers undergo a liquid:solid phase transition, forming a protein matrix that retards mobility of ER proteins by size-dependent molecular filtration. The Z-α<sub>1</sub>-antitrypsin phase transition is promoted during ER stress by an ATF6-mediated unfolded protein response. Furthermore, the ER chaperone calreticulin promotes Z-α<sub>1</sub>-antitrypsin solidification and increases protein matrix stiffness. Single-particle tracking reveals that solidification initiates in cells with normal ER morphology, previously assumed to represent a healthy pool. We show that Z-α<sub>1</sub>-antitrypsin-induced hypersensitivity to ER stress can be explained by immobilization of ER chaperones within the polymer matrix. This previously unidentified mechanism of ER dysfunction provides a template for understanding a diverse group of related proteinopathies and identifies ER chaperones as potential therapeutic targets."

Our aim was to evaluate the risk and the risk factors for incident cancer in PiZZ individuals compared with the general population with known smoking habits. A longitudinal study of PiZZ individuals (n=1595) from the Swedish National AATD Register, and controls (n=5999) from Swedish population-based cohorts. Data on cancer and mortality were obtained by cross-linkage with national registers. Individuals who had undergone lung transplantation (n=10) and those with a cancer diagnosis within 5 years prior to inclusion (n=63) were excluded. The risk factors for developing cancer were analysed using proportional hazards and Fine-Gray regression models, adjusting for age, sex, smoking habits and the presence of liver disease. The median follow-up time was 17 years (interquartile range 11 years) for the whole study population. The incidence rates of hepatic and non-hepatic cancer per 1000 person-years were 1.6 (95% CI 1.1-2.3) and 8.5 (95% CI 7.2-10.0), respectively, for the PiZZ individuals, and 0.1 (95% CI 0.04-0.2) and 6.6 (95% CI 6.0-7.1), respectively, for the controls. The adjusted hazard ratios for hepatic and for non-hepatic cancer were 23.4 (95% CI 9.9-55.4) and 1.3 (95% CI 1.1-1.5), respectively, in the PiZZ individuals compared with the controls. These results suggest that individuals with severe AATD may have an increased risk of developing both hepatic and non-hepatic cancer, compared with the general population."

In this study, the clinical and genetic profile of pulmonary patients from a single center in La Palma Island (Canary Islands, Spain) was assessed to predict how to increase AATD diagnosis. AATD was tested in 1,493 pulmonary outpatients without regard to respiratory symptoms and 465 newborns. Variants of the SERPINA1 gene were characterised by real-time PCR, DNA sequencing, molecular haplotyping and phenotyping (AAT isoelectric focusing). Different respiratory pathologies were diagnosed in patients and their levels of serum AAT were measured by nephelometry. The prevalence of pneumological patients with AATD alleles was 30.5%, including PI*S, PI*Z and 6 rare genetic variants. Certain deficiency genotypes were unevenly distributed among patients diagnosed with respiratory diseases: PI*ZZ (71.4%) and PI*SS (34.8%) genotypes were more represented in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), whereas PI*MZ (27.7%) and PI*SZ (34.5%) genotypes were more abundant in patients with bronchial asthma. The estimated frequency of PI*S and PI*Z alleles in the general population was 8.2% and 2.1%, respectively. A very significant enrichment (p< 0.01) of PI*S allele, independent of the PI*Z allele, was detected in the clinical population. AATD diagnosis would improve if both the COPD and the asthmatic patients were included to screening programs. The prevalence of PI*ZZ genotype in La Palma (1/2,162) was relatively high within Spain (average 1/3,344)."

A single amino acid mutation (Lys342Glu) results in an expression of misfolded Z-AAT protein, which has a high propensity to intra- and extra-cellular polymerization. Here, we asked whether levels of circulating Z-AAT polymers are associated with the severity of lung disease, liver disease, or both. We obtained cross sectional data from the Dutch part of the Alpha1 International Registry of 52 ZZ-AAT patients who performed a pulmonary function test and donated a blood sample on the same day. From the Alpha-1 Liver Aachen Registry, we obtained a cohort of 40 ZZ-AAT patients with available data on their liver function. The levels of plasma Z-AAT polymers were determined using a LG96 monoclonal antibody-based sandwich ELISA. In a Dutch cohort, the median plasma level of Z-AAT polymers of patients diagnosed for pulmonary disease was 947.5 µg/mL (733.6−1218 µg/mL (95% CI)), which did not correlate with airflow obstruction or gas transfer value. In the Alpha-1 liver patient cohort, the median polymer level was 1245.9 µg/mL (753−2034 µg/mL (95% CI)), which correlated with plasma gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT, rs = 0.57, p = 0.001), glutamate dehydrogenase (GLDH, rs = 0.48, p = 0.002) and triglycerides (TG, rs = 0.48, p = 0.0046). A Wilcoxon rank test showed higher Z-AAT polymer values for the liver over the lung group (p < 0.0001). These correlations support a possible link between plasma Z-AAT polymers and the liver function."

    "abstract": "α1-antitrypsin (AAT) is a serine protease inhibitor synthesized in hepatocytes and protects the lung from damage by neutrophil elastase. AAT gene mutations result in AAT deficiency (AATD), which leads to lung and liver diseases. The AAT Z variant forms polymer within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of hepatocytes and results in reduction in AAT secretion and severe disease. Previous studies demonstrated a secretion defect of AAT in LMAN1 deficient cells, and mild decreases in AAT levels in male LMAN1 and MCFD2 deficient mice. LMAN1 is a transmembrane lectin that forms a complex with a small soluble protein MCFD2. The LMAN1-MCFD2 protein complex cycles between the ER and the Golgi. Here, we report that LMAN1 and MCFD2 knockout (KO) HepG2 and HEK293T cells display reduced AAT secretion and elevated intracellular AAT levels due to a delayed ER-to-Golgi transport of AAT. Secretion defects in KO cells were rescued by wild-type LMAN1 or MCFD2, but not by mutant proteins. Elimination of the second glycosylation site of AAT abolished LMAN1 dependent secretion. Co-immunoprecipitation experiment in MCFD2 KO cells suggested that AAT interaction with LMAN1 is independent of MCFD2. Furthermore, our results suggest that secretion of the Z variant, both monomers and polymers, is also LMAN1-dependent. Results provide direct evidence supporting that the LMAN1-MCFD2 complex is a cargo receptor for the ER-to-Golgi transport of AAT and that interactions of LMAN1 with an N-glycan of AAT is critical for this process. These results have implications in production of recombinant AAT and in developing treatments for AATD patients."

Misfolded proteins may induce oxidative stress and subsequent cell death. The potential application of antioxidant response signaling pathway and antioxidants to cope with Z-type α<sub>1</sub>-antitrypsin-induced oxidative stress was evaluated. Overexpression of Z-type α<sub>1</sub>-antitrypsin in Saccharomyces cerevisiae provoked oxidative stress and increased susceptibility to oxidative challenges such as hydrogen peroxide treatment.

Antioxidant treatment alleviated oxidative stress and cytotoxicity induced by Z-type α<sub>1</sub>-antitrypsin. Our results show that cellular antioxidant capacity is crucial to protection against misfolded Z-type α<sub>1</sub>-antitrypsin.

To compare treatment failure in hospitalized patients with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) receiving azithromycin or beta-lactams. Retrospective, multicenter cohort study using logistic regression for multivariable analysis. Patients were included if they were at least 18 years old, admitted with AECOPD, and received at least two consecutive days of either a beta-lactam or azithromycin. Patients were excluded if they received concomitant azithromycin and beta-lactam antibiotics during the first 2 days, had a history of other severe underlying pulmonary diseases, pregnancy, COVID-19, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, or received a corticosteroid for a diagnosis other than COPD. Five hundred ninety-five patients were included, of which 428 (72%) received azithromycin and 167 patients (28%) received a beta-lactam. The primary endpoint was treatment failure rate in patients receiving azithromycin versus beta-lactams, which was a composite endpoint defined as in-hospital mortality, admission to intensive care, initiation of invasive mechanical ventilation, initiation of a new antibiotic, steroid therapy escalation, or readmission due to AECOPD within 30 days. The composite primary outcome occurred in 84 patients (19.6%) in the azithromycin group and 54 (32.3%) in the beta-lactam group (p<0.01). The difference in the composite outcome was a result of higher rates of new antibiotics during admission (12.6% vs 4.2%; p<0.01) and higher readmission within 30 days (19.3% vs 12.4%; p=0.032). After controlling for potential confounders, beta-lactams continued to demonstrate a higher risk for treatment failure (OR, 2.30; 95% CI, 1.46-3.63). There was no difference in adverse effects between the groups. Azithromycin was associated with less treatment failure in AECOPD which was driven by lower readmission rates and prescription of new antimicrobials."

Here we report a biochemical comparability analysis based on data from a phase 2/3, randomized, double-blind, two-arm study with partial crossover of Glassia® (Baxalta US Inc. Westlake Village, CA, USA) and Prolastin® (Grifols Therapeutics LLC, Research Triangle Park, NC, USA) in patients with AATD (NCT00460096). Patients (N = 50) were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive either Glassia (n = 33) or Prolastin (n = 17), respectively. In the present study, data from patients in the per-protocol population (n = 29, Glassia; n = 12, Prolastin) were analyzed.

For both antigenic and functional A1PI levels, with or without baseline correction, the geometric mean ratios (GMRs) of plasma trough levels (Glassia/Prolastin) over a 6-week period at steady state (Weeks 7-12 post-randomization) were near or above 100%, with the 90% confidence intervals (CIs) contained within the 80%-125% interval. For antigenic A1PI, the GMR (90% CI) was 115.8% (108.1-124.2) for baseline corrected and 114.2% (109.2-119.5) for uncorrected concentrations. For functional A1PI, the GMR (90% CI) was 98.7 (92.5-105.4) for baseline corrected and 107.8% (102.3-113.5) for uncorrected concentrations. In conclusion, the biochemical efficacy of Glassia using the endpoints of plasma antigenic and functional A1PI trough concentrations at steady state was comparable with Prolastin in patients with AATD."

    "abstract": "Insulin signaling is known to regulate essential proteostasis mechanisms. The analyses here examined effects of insulin signaling in the PiZ mouse model of α1-antitrypsin deficiency in which hepatocellular accumulation and proteotoxicity of the misfolded α1-antitrypsin Z variant (ATZ) causes liver fibrosis and cancer. We first studied the effects of breeding PiZ mice to liver-insulin-receptor knockout (LIRKO) mice (with hepatocyte-specific insulin-receptor gene disruption). The results showed decreased hepatic ATZ accumulation and liver fibrosis in PiZ x LIRKO vs PiZ mice, with reversal of those effects when we bred PiZ x LIRKO mice onto a FOXO1-deficient background. Increased intracellular degradation of ATZ mediated by autophagy was identified as the likely mechanism for diminished hepatic proteotoxicity in PiZ x LIRKO mice and the converse was responsible for enhanced toxicity in PiZ x LIRKO x FOXO1-KO animals. Transcriptomic studies showed major effects on oxidative phosphorylation and autophagy genes, and significant induction of peroxisome proliferator-activated-receptor-γ-coactivator-1α (PGC1α) expression in PiZ-LIRKO mice. Because PGC1α plays a key role in oxidative phosphorylation, we further investigated its effects on ATZ proteostasis in our ATZ-expressing mammalian cell model. The results showed PGC1α overexpression or activation enhances autophagic ATZ degradation. These data implicate suppression of autophagic ATZ degradation by down-regulation of PGC1α as one mechanism by which insulin signaling exacerbates hepatic proteotoxicity in PiZ mice, and identify PGC1α as a novel target for development of new human α1-antitrypsin deficiency liver disease therapies."

    "abstract": "Patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) develop a febrile pro-inflammatory cytokinemia with accelerated progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Here we report the results of a phase 2, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of intravenous (IV) plasma-purified alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) for moderate to severe ARDS secondary to COVID-19 (EudraCT 2020-001391-15). Patients (n = 36) were randomized to receive weekly placebo, weekly AAT (Prolastin, Grifols, S.A.; 120 mg/kg), or AAT once followed by weekly placebo. The primary endpoint was the change in plasma interleukin (IL)-6 concentration at 1 week. In addition to assessing safety and tolerability, changes in plasma levels of IL-1β, IL-8, IL-10, and soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (sTNFR1) and clinical outcomes were assessed as secondary endpoints. Treatment with IV AAT resulted in decreased inflammation and was safe and well tolerated. The study met its primary endpoint, with decreased circulating IL-6 concentrations at 1 week in the treatment group. This was in contrast to the placebo group, where IL-6 was increased. Similarly, plasma sTNFR1 was substantially decreased in the treatment group while remaining unchanged in patients receiving placebo. IV AAT did not definitively reduce levels of IL-1β, IL-8, and IL-10. No difference in mortality or ventilator-free days was observed between groups, although a trend toward decreased time on ventilator was observed in AAT-treated patients. In patients with COVID-19 and moderate to severe ARDS, treatment with IV AAT was safe, feasible, and biochemically efficacious. The data support progression to a phase 3 trial and prompt further investigation of AAT as an anti-inflammatory therapeutic. ECSA-2020-009; Elaine Galwey Research Bursary."

    "title": "A Review of Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Binding Partners for Immune Regulation and Potential Therapeutic Application.",
    "abstract": "Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) is the canonical serine protease inhibitor of neutrophil-derived proteases and can modulate innate immune mechanisms through its anti-inflammatory activities mediated by a broad spectrum of protein, cytokine, and cell surface interactions. AAT contains a reactive methionine residue that is critical for its protease-specific binding capacity, whereby AAT entraps the protease on cleavage of its reactive centre loop, neutralises its activity by key changes in its tertiary structure, and permits removal of the AAT-protease complex from the circulation. Recently, however, the immunomodulatory role of AAT has come increasingly to the fore with several prominent studies focused on lipid or protein-protein interactions that are predominantly mediated through electrostatic, glycan, or hydrophobic potential binding sites. The aim of this review was to investigate the spectrum of AAT molecular interactions, with newer studies supporting a potential therapeutic paradigm for AAT augmentation therapy in disorders in which a chronic immune response is strongly linked."

This study aimed to determine the genetic variation in the SERPINA1 gene and a possible thrombotic risk of these variants in a population-based cohort study. The coding sequence of SERPINA1 was analyzed for the Z (rs28929474), S (rs17580), and other qualifying variants in 28,794 subjects without previous VTE (born 1923-1950, 60% women), who participated in the Malmö Diet and Cancer study (1991-1996). Individuals were followed from baseline until the first event of VTE, death, or 2018. Resequencing the coding sequence of SERPINA1 identified 84 variants in the total study population, 21 synonymous, 62 missense, and 1 loss-of-function variant. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that homozygosity for the Z allele increased the risk of VTE whereas heterozygosity showed no effect. The S (rs17580) variant was not associated with VTE. Thirty-one rare variants were qualifying and included in collapsing analysis using the following selection criteria, loss of function, in frame deletion or non-benign (PolyPhen-2) missense variants with minor allele frequency (MAF) <0.1%. Combining the rare qualifying variants with the Z variant showed that carrying two alleles (ZZ or compound heterozygotes) showed increased risk. Cox regression analysis revealed an adjusted hazard ratio of 4.5 (95% confidence interval 2.0-10.0) for combinations of the Z variant and rare qualifying variants. One other variant (rs141620200; MAF = 0.002) showed an increased risk of VTE. The SERPINA1 ZZ genotype and compound heterozygotes for severe AATD are rare but associated with VTE in a population-based Swedish study."

    "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), has been rapidly spreading since December 2019, and within a few months, it turned out to be a global pandemic. The disease affects primarily the lungs, but its pathogenesis spreads to other organs as well. However, its mortality rates vary, and in the majority of infected people, there are no serious consequences. Many factors including advanced age, preexisting health conditions, and genetic predispositions are believed to exacerbate outcomes of COVID-19. The virus contains several structural proteins including the spike (S) protein with subunits for binding, fusion, and internalization into host cells following interaction with host cell receptors and proteases (ACE2 and TMPRSS2, respectively) to cause the subsequent pathology. Although the pandemic has spread into all countries, most of Africa is thought of as having relatively less prevalence and mortality. Several hypotheses have been forwarded as reasons for this and include warmer weather conditions, vaccination with BCG (i.e., trained immunity), and previous malaria infection. From genetics or metabolic points of view, it has been proposed that most African populations could be protected to some degree because they lack some genetic susceptibility risk factors or have low-level expression of allelic variants, such as ACE2 and TMPRSS2 that are thought to be involved in increased infection risk or disease severity. The frequency of occurrence of <i>α</i>-1 antitrypsin (an inhibitor of a tissue-degrading protease, thereby protecting target host tissues including the lung) deficiency is also reported to be low in most African populations. More recently, infections in Africa appear to be on the rise. In general, there are few studies on the epidemiology and pathogenesis of the disease in African contexts, and the overall costs and human life losses due to the pandemic in Africa will be determined by all factors and conditions interacting in complex ways."

    "abstract": "ATP-binding cassette transporter G1 (ABCG1) is a cellular transmembrane protein that transports oxysterol efflux from cells to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles in the plasma. Previous studies have demonstrated that an ABCG1 deficiency exerts an antiatherosclerotic function through the effects of oxysterol accumulation in cells to enhance apoptosis and regulate inflammatory processes. However, whether the deficiency of ABCG1 and the corresponding changes in the efflux of oxysterols could take a series of impacts on the proteomic composition of HDL remains unclear. Here, plasma HDL of ABCG1(-/-) mice and their wild-type controls on a normal chow diet (NCD) or a high-fat diet (HFD) were isolated by ultracentrifugation. The proportion of 7-ketocholesterol and the proteomic composition of samples were comparatively analyzed by LC-MS/MS. In NCD-fed mice, lipid metabolism-related protein (arachidonate 12-lipoxygenase) and antioxidative protein (pantetheinase) exhibited increased accumulation, and inflammatory response protein (alpha-1-antitrypsin) was decreased in accumulation in ABCG1(-/-) mice HDL. In HFD-fed mice, fewer proteins were detected than that of NCD-fed mice. The ABCG1(-/-) mice HDL exhibited increased accumulation of lipid metabolism-related proteins (e.g., carboxylesterase 1C, apolipoprotein (apo)C-4) and decreased accumulation of alpha-1-antitrypsin, as well as significantly reduced proportion of 7-ketocholesterol. Additionally, positive correlations were found between 7-ketocholesterol and some essential proteins on HDL, such as alpha-1-antitrypsin, apoA-4, apoB-100, and serum amyloid A (SAA). These results suggest a detrimental impact of oxysterols on HDL composition, which might affect the antiatherosclerotic properties of HDL."

Pulmonary involvement of α1-antitrypsin deficiency may also include emphysema with variable functional and radiological abnormalities, asthma, and bronchiectasis. Asthma and AATD are mutually exclusive disease entities, but the commonality of neutrophil inflammation across the diseases might suggest common underlying mechanisms of effect. The diseases share many clinical and functional features: patients with AATD commonly first present with asthma-like symptoms; functional alterations may be common to both, such as bronchial hyperresponsiveness or fixed obstruction after bronchial remodeling. It has been recognized that allergy and asthma often coexist with AATD, but the relationship between allergy, asthma and AATD is not clear. Distinguishing AATD from asthma based on presentation and clinical evaluation is not possible. The clinician must assess each of the elements in the context of the whole patient, any patient with difficult-to-manage asthma should be screened for AATD. From the clinician's point of view, improving diagnosis in this population is fundamental to optimize clinical management. Genetic studies will probably be needed in the future to unequivocally establish the causal link between AATD and asthma."

We investigated the protease-anti-protease balance in the circulation and pulmonary compartments in SARS-CoV-2 acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) compared to non-SARS-CoV-2 ARDS (nsARDS) and the effects of tocilizumab (IL-6 receptor antagonist) on anti-protease defence in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Levels and activity of AAT and neutrophil elastase (NE) were measured in plasma, airway tissue and tracheal secretions (TA) of people with SARS-CoV-2 ARDS or nsARDS. AAT and IL-6 levels were evaluated in people with moderate SARS-CoV-2 infection who received standard of care +/- tocilizumab. AAT plasma levels doubled in SARS-CoV-2 ARDS. In lung parenchyma AAT levels were increased, as was the percentage of neutrophils involved in NET formation. A protease-anti-protease imbalance was detected in TA with active NE and no active AAT. The airway anti-protease, secretory leukoprotease inhibitor was decreased in SARS-CoV-2-infected lungs and cleaved in TA. In nsARDS, plasma AAT levels were elevated but TA samples had less AAT cleavage, with no detectable active NE in most samples. Induction of AAT in ARDS occurred mainly through IL-6. Tocilizumab down-regulated AAT during SARS-CoV-2 infection. There is a protease-anti-protease imbalance in the airways of SARS-CoV-2-ARDS patients. This imbalance is a target for anti-protease therapy.

Despite its wide distribution, it is largely underdiagnosed, thus being considered a rare disease, and is consequently managed in ad-hoc reference centers. Unfortunately, an easy-to-use algorithm for managing such a complex disease is still lacking. An expert consensus meeting was conducted among experts in the management of AATD to build a comprehensive algorithm, including diagnosis, monitoring, AAT therapy, rehabilitation and lung transplantation, and liver disease, that could serve as a guide for physicians and treating centers. A panel of AATD specialists evaluated the results of their work. Diagnosis is the most delicate phase, and awareness about this condition should be raised among GPs. A set of recommendations has been written about the most suitable follow-up visits. Augmentation therapy with AAT may be useful to reduce the progression of emphysema and lung function decline in selected patients. Exercise capacity may be improved by pulmonary rehabilitation and, in selected cases, by lung volume reduction or lung transplantation. Support therapies are needed for those who develop liver disease, and, in selected cases, liver transplantation may be considered. Patients should be carefully educated about their lifestyle, including smoking cessation, body weight control, and reduced alcohol intake. The proposed algorithm obtained the endorsement of the Italian Society of Pneumology (SIP). However, further studies and additional clinical data are required to confirm the validity of these recommendations."

    "abstract": "Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a rare autosomal codominant disease caused by mutations within the SERPINA1 gene. The most prevalent variant in patients is PiZ SERPINA1, containing a single G > A transition mutation. PiZ alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) is prone to misfolding, leading to the accumulation of toxic aggregates within hepatocytes. In addition, the abnormally low level of AAT secreted into circulation provides insufficient inhibition of neutrophil elastase within the lungs, eventually causing emphysema. Cytosine and adenine base editors enable the programmable conversion of C⋅G to T⋅A and A⋅T to G⋅C base pairs, respectively. In this study, two different base editing approaches were developed: use of a cytosine base editor to install a compensatory mutation (p.Met374Ile) and use of an adenine base editor to mediate the correction of the pathogenic PiZ mutation. After treatment with lipid nanoparticles formulated with base editing reagents, PiZ-transgenic mice exhibited durable editing of SERPINA1 in the liver, increased serum AAT, and improved liver histology. These results indicate that base editing has the potential to address both lung and liver disease in AATD."

We hypothesized that ferrets would model human AATD-related lung and hepatic disease. AAT-knockout (AAT-KO) and PiZZ (E342K, the most common mutation in humans) ferrets were generated and compared with matched controls using custom-designed flexiVent modules to perform pulmonary function tests, quantitative computed tomography (QCT), bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) proteomics, and alveolar morphometry. Complete loss of AAT (AAT-KO) led to increased pulmonary compliance and expiratory airflow limitation, consistent with obstructive lung disease. QCT and morphometry confirmed emphysema and airspace enlargement, respectively. Pathway analysis of BAL proteomics data revealed inflammatory lung disease and impaired cellular migration. The PiZ mutation resulted in altered AAT protein folding in the liver, hepatic injury, and reduced plasma concentrations of AAT, and PiZZ ferrets developed obstructive lung disease. In summary, AAT-KO and PiZZ ferrets model the progressive obstructive pulmonary disease seen in AAT-deficient patients and may serve as a platform for preclinical testing of therapeutics including gene therapy."

Here we focused on the individual expression of the SERPINA1 gene exon 5 leading to direct translation of alpha1-antitrypsin (AAT) C-terminal peptides. The discovery of alternative ways for their production may expand the current understanding of the serpin gene's functioning. We detected short transcripts expressed primarily in hepatocytes. We identified four variants of hepatocyte-specific SERPINA1 short transcripts and individually probed their potential to be translated in living cells. The long mRNA gave the full-length AAT-eGFP fusion, while in case of short transcripts we deduced four active SERPINA1 in-frame alternative ORFs encoding 10, 21, 153 and 169 amino acids AAT C-terminal oligo- and polypeptides. Unlike secretory AAT-eGFP fusion exhibiting classical AAT behavior, truncated AAT-fusions differ by intracellular retention and nuclear enrichment. Immunofluorescence on the endogenous AAT C-terminal epitope showed its accumulation in the cell nucleoli, indicating that short transcripts may be translated in vivo. FANTOM5 CAGE data on SERPINA1 suggest that short transcripts originate from the post-transcriptional cleavage of the spliced mRNA, initiated mainly from the hepatocyte-specific promoter. CONCLUSION: Short SERPINA1 transcripts may represent a source for the direct synthesis of AAT C-terminal peptides with properties uncommon to AAT."

Emerging evidence suggests that α-1 antitrypsin (A1AT), a circulating protein with protective effects on the lung and other vital organs, plays a critical role in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection and may be a promising therapeutic option for patients with COVID-19. A1AT deficiency (AATD) is characterized by dysfunctional or insufficient levels of A1AT. Recently, we have proposed that AATD patients are a vulnerable population for COVID-19. Patients with AATD may derive limited benefit from the current COVID-19 vaccines and continue to rely on conventional medical therapy and behavioral adaptations to mitigate the risk of infection. Unfortunately, this population has not been included in the COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials and studies have yet to characterize the safety, immunogenicity, and ultimately, the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines for AATD patients.

A phone questionnaire was administered to 22 patients with severe alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency who were currently receiving AAT augmentation therapy. Inclusion criteria included patients [Formula: see text] 18 years old, diagnosed with AATD, and receiving intravenous AAT protein augmentation therapy. Information was gathered regarding demographics, perspectives on transitioning to self-administered treatment, and anxiety and depression prevalence. Results were collected anonymously using REDCap. Joint and marginal statistical analysis was done to quantify links between participants' willingness to transition to self-infusion and correlations with sex, age, years of therapy, anxiety, and depression. Of 22 patients, 14 were male and eight were female. Ages ranged from 36 to 79 years, with an average of 62.5. Genotypes were ZZ (14), MZ (3), and SZ (2) among others. Average length of intravenous augmentation was 9.5 years. The majority, 16 participants, were aware self-infusion was an option. Eight participants were willing to consider transitioning to self-infusion if trained and educated. Eight patients reported that fear of COVID-19 transmission influenced their decision-making. Above-normal anxiety, and depression scores, were found in four, and six patients, respectively. Neither sex, age, years of treatment, anxiety, or depression were found to be associated with willingness to consider self-infusion therapy.

This study is the continuation of an earlier one published by the same group in 2015, aimed at analysing risk of LC in never-smokers, associated with carriers of the AATD genotype. A multicentre case-control study was conducted in Spain across the period January 2011 to August 2019. Cases were non-smokers diagnosed with LC, and controls were composed of never-smoking individuals undergoing major non-cancer-related surgery. Data were collected on epidemiological characteristics, exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS), residential radon levels, and alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) genotype. The study included 457 cases (42%) and 631 controls (58%), with a predominance of women (72,8%). The most frequent histological type was adenocarcinoma (77.5%), followed by squamous cell carcinoma (7.7%). No association of risk of LC was found with the status of AATD genotype carrier, both overall and broken down by age, sex, or exposure to ETS. No risk association was found between being a carrier of an AAT deficiency genotype and LC among never-smokers. In order to establish the existence of an association, we consider it important to expand the studies in never smokers in different geographical areas as well as to include patients with previous chronic lung diseases to assess if it influences the risk."

Since patients with severe AATD may have a very different prognosis and AT requires intravenous infusions for life, the decision to initiate AT may be challenging. This survey was conducted on 63 experts in AATD from 13 European countries about their opinions and attitudes regarding AT. Participants were asked to rank the importance of 11 identified factors related with the prescription of AT. In addition, each participant was asked to respond to the indication of AT for 30 out of 500 hypothetical cases developed with the combinations of the 11 factors. Each case was evaluated by 3 experts to check the concordance. The variables that scored higher on preferences for initiating AT were AAT genotype (score 8.6 from a Likert scale 0-10 (SD: 1.7)), AATD serum level (8.2 (SD:2.4)) and FEV1 (%) decline (7.9 (SD:2.4)). Among the 500 different cases, there was an agreement in indication of AT among the 3 experts in 291 (58.2%). Regarding the variables associated with AT, it was indicated to 81.9% of Pi*ZZ, 52.4% of Pi*SZ and 9.8% of Pi*MZ (p < 0.0001). For Pi*ZZ patients, multivariate analysis identified younger age, reduced FEV1 (%), higher FEV1 decline and worse emphysema as significantly associated with prescription (AUC = 0.8114); for Pi*SZ variables were younger age, worse FEV1 (%) and worse emphysema (AUC = 0.7414); and for Pi*MZ younger age, worse DLCO (%), higher DLCO decline and dyspnea (AUC = 0.8387). There is a high variability in the criteria for prescription of AT among European experts. Most cases were recommended AT according to guidelines, but a significant number of patients with genotype Pi*SZ and almost 10% Pi*MZ were recommended to initiate AT despite the lack of evidence of efficacy in these genotypes."

Compared to the 156 (41%) ever-smokers, the 221 (59%) never-smokers had better lung function (mean FEV<sub>1</sub> 98 (SD 18) vs 85 (SD 28) % predicted; p < 0.001), and fewer of them were symptomatic, ie, with respiratory symptoms, at inclusion (20% vs 42%; p < 0.001). They also had a lower annual decline in FEV<sub>1</sub> (mean 42 (95% CI 36-47) vs 53 (95% CI 47-60) mL·yr<sup>-1</sup>; p = 0.011) and better survival than the ever-smokers. The risk factors for having a diagnosis of COPD were the identification of severe AATD at an age of ≥14 years and the presence of respiratory symptoms or diseases. Never-smoking individuals with severe AATD identified by screening have better lung function, fewer symptoms, and better survival compared with the ever-smokers. Screening for AATD at an early age may improve the prognosis of AATD."

    "abstract": "Prime editing is a versatile and precise genome editing technique that can directly copy desired genetic modifications into target DNA sites without the need for donor DNA. This technique holds great promise for the analysis of gene function, disease modeling, and the correction of pathogenic mutations in clinically relevant cells such as human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). Here, we comprehensively tested prime editing in hPSCs by generating a doxycycline-inducible prime editing platform. Prime editing successfully induced all types of nucleotide substitutions and small insertions and deletions, similar to observations in other human cell types. Moreover, we compared prime editing and base editing for correcting a disease-related mutation in induced pluripotent stem cells derived form a patient with α 1-antitrypsin (A1AT) deficiency. Finally, whole-genome sequencing showed that, unlike the cytidine deaminase domain of cytosine base editors, the reverse transcriptase domain of a prime editor does not lead to guide RNA-independent off-target mutations in the genome. Our results demonstrate that prime editing in hPSCs has great potential for complementing previously developed CRISPR genome editing tools."

    "abstract": "Lung transplantation is an established treatment option that can improve quality of life and prolong survival for select patients diagnosed with end-stage lung disease. Given the gaps in organ donation and failures to make effective use of available organs, careful selection of candidates for lung transplant remains one of the most important considerations of the transplant community. Toward this end, we briefly reviewed recent trends in pretransplant evaluation, candidate selection, organ allocation, and organ preservation techniques. Since the latest consensus statement regarding appropriate selection of lung transplant candidates, many advances in the science and practice of lung transplantation have emerged and influenced our perspective of 'contraindications' to transplant. These advances have made it increasingly possible to pursue lung transplant in patients with risk factors for decreased survival-namely, older recipient age, increased body mass index, previous chest surgery, poorer nutritional status, and presence of chronic infection, cardiovascular disease, or extrapulmonary comorbid conditions. Therefore, we reviewed the updated evidence demonstrating the prognostic impact of these risk factors in lung transplant recipients. Lastly, we reviewed the salient evidence for current trends in disease-specific indications for lung transplantation, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, cystic fibrosis, emphysema due to alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, and pulmonary arterial hypertension, among other less common end-stage diseases. Overall, lung transplant remains an exciting field with considerable hope for patients as they experience remarkable improvements in quality of life and survival in the modern era."

    "abstract": "Severe hereditary alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a known risk factor for the early development of pulmonary emphysema and COPD, especially in smokers. By the Swedish national screening programme carried out from 1972 to 1974, a cohort of individuals with severe (PiZZ) AATD was identified and has been followed up regularly. The aim of this study was to investigate health status, quality of life and lung function in this cohort at the age of 42 years compared with an age-matched control group randomly selected from the population registry. All study participants answered a questionnaire on smoking habits, symptoms, occupation, exposure to airway irritants and quality of life using Saint George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). They underwent complete pulmonary function tests (PFT) and forced oscillation technique (FOT) for the measurement of airway resistance and reactance. Blood samples were taken for allergies and IgG-subclasses as an indicator of increased risk of airway infections. The residual volume (RV), total lung capacity (TLC) and RV/TLC ratio were significantly higher in the PiZZ ever-smokers compared to the PiMM ever-smokers and PiZZ never-smokers (p < 0.05). The resistance in the upper, small and total airways was significantly lower in PiZZ subjects compared to PiMM subjects (p < 0.05). A greater proportion of PiZZ never-smokers had an FEV<sub>1</sub>/VC ratio <0.7 than PiMM never-smokers (p = 0.043). PiZZ subjects with occupational exposure to airway irritants showed a significantly lower FEV<sub>1</sub>, VC and higher RV/TLC ratio than PiMM individuals with exposure (p < 0.05). At the age of 42, ever-smoking PiZZ individuals have signs of COPD, and also PiZZ never-smokers have early, physiological signs of emphysema."

    "abstract": "Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is caused by a single mutation in the SERPINA1 gene, which culminates in the accumulation of misfolded alpha-1 antitrypsin (ZAAT) within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of hepatocytes. AATD is associated with liver disease resulting from hepatocyte injury due to ZAAT-mediated toxic gain-of-function and ER stress. There is evidence of mitochondrial damage in AATD-mediated liver disease; however, the mechanism by which hepatocyte retention of aggregated ZAAT leads to mitochondrial injury is unknown. Previous studies have shown that ER stress is associated with both high concentrations of fatty acids and mitochondrial dysfunction in hepatocytes. Using a human AAT transgenic mouse model and hepatocyte cell lines, we show abnormal mitochondrial morphology and function, and dysregulated lipid metabolism, which are associated with hepatic expression and accumulation of ZAAT. We also describe a novel mechanism of ZAAT-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction. We provide evidence that misfolded ZAAT translocates to the mitochondria for degradation. Furthermore, inhibition of ZAAT expression restores the mitochondrial function in ZAAT-expressing hepatocytes. Altogether, our results show that ZAAT aggregation in hepatocytes leads to mitochondrial dysfunction. Our findings suggest a plausible model for AATD liver injury and the possibility of mechanism-based therapeutic interventions for AATD liver disease."

Neutrophils play a central role in the pathogenesis of AATD. Dysregulated complement activation in AATD results in increased plasma levels of C3d. The current study investigated the impact of C3d on circulating neutrophils. Blood was collected from AATD (<i>n</i> = 88) or non-AATD COPD patients (<i>n</i> = 10) and healthy controls (HC) (<i>n</i> = 40). Neutrophils were challenged with C3d, and degranulation was assessed by Western blotting, ELISA, or fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) substrate assays. Ex vivo, C3d levels were increased in plasma (<i>p</i> < 0.0001) and on neutrophil plasma membranes (<i>p</i> = 0.038) in AATD compared to HC. C3d binding to CR3 receptors triggered primary (<i>p</i> = 0.01), secondary (<i>p</i> = 0.004), and tertiary (<i>p</i> = 0.018) granule release and increased CXCL8 secretion (<i>p</i> = 0.02).

In endothelial cell scratch wound assays, C3d significantly decreased cell migration (<i>p</i> < 0.0001), an effect potentiated by neutrophil degranulated proteins (<i>p</i> < 0.0001). In summary, AATD patients had increased C3d in plasma and on neutrophil membranes and, together with neutrophil-released granule enzymes, reduced endothelial cell migration and wound healing, with potential implications for AATD-related vasculitis."

These tests include aminotransferases, alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, bilirubin, albumin, prothrombin time and international normalized ratio (INR). Abnormal liver biochemical tests can be categorized based on the pattern and the magnitude of aminotransferases elevation. Generally, abnormalities in aminotransferases can be classified into a hepatocellular pattern or cholestatic pattern and can be further sub-classified based on the magnitude of aminotransferase elevation to mild [< 5 × upper limit of normal (ULN)], moderate (> 5-< 15 × ULN) and severe (> 15 × ULN). Hepatocellular pattern causes include but are not limited to; non-alcoholic fatty liver disease/non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, alcohol use, chronic viral hepatitis, liver cirrhosis (variable), autoimmune hepatitis, hemochromatosis, Wilson's disease, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, celiac disease, medication-induced and ischemic hepatitis. Cholestatic pattern causes include but is not limited to; biliary pathology (obstruction, autoimmune), other conditions with hyperbilirubinemia (conjugated and unconjugated). It is crucial to interpret these commonly ordered tests accurately as appropriate further workup, treatment and referral can greatly benefit the patient due to prompt treatment which can improve the natural history of several of the diseases mentioned and possibly reduce the risk of progression to the liver cirrhosis."

    "abstract": "Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) is an endogenous inhibitor of serine proteases which, in physiological conditions, neutralizes the excess of neutrophil elastase and other serine proteases in tissues and especially the lungs. Weekly intravenous infusion of plasma-purified human AAT is used to treat AAT deficiency-associated lung disease. However, only 2 % of the AAT dose reach the lungs after intravenous infusion. Inhalation of AAT might offer an alternative route of administration. Yet, the rapid clearance of AAT from the respiratory tract results in high and frequent dosing by inhalation and limited efficacy. In the present study, we produced and characterized in vitro a PEGylated version of AAT which could offer a prolonged body residence time and thereby be useful for augmentation therapy by the intravenous and inhalation routes. Two PEGylation reactions - N-terminal and thiol PEGylation - and three polyethylene glycol (PEG) chains - linear 30 kDa, linear 40 kDa and 2-armed 40 kDa - were used. The yields of mono-PEGylated AAT following purification by anion exchange chromatography were 40-50 % for N-terminal PEGylation and 60-70% for thiol PEGylation. The PEG-AAT conjugates preserved the ability to form a protease-inhibitor complex with neutrophil elastase and proteinase 3 as well as the full inhibitory capacity to neutralize neutrophil elastase activity. These results open up interesting prospects for PEGylated AAT to achieve a prolonged half-life and an improved therapeutic efficacy in vivo."

Individuals with α-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency (AATD) have a dramatically increased risk of developing COPD. To understand this further, the aim of this study was to investigate whether AATD presents with altered neutrophil NADPH oxidase activation, due to the specific lack of plasma AAT. Experiments were performed using circulating neutrophils isolated from healthy controls and individuals with AATD. Superoxide anion (O<sub>2</sub> <sup>-</sup>) production was determined from the rate of reduction of cytochrome c.

This creates difficulties to ensure that comprehensive care is administered to both organ systems. Past assessments of care delivered to patients with AATD demonstrated that improvements are needed. For that reason, we reassessed a population of patients with AATD in a large health care system to see if past findings affected present care. <b>Methods:</b> We performed electronic health record (EHR) reviews on all patients with documented AATD and confirmed the diagnosis by evidence of genotyping. We then selected the patients with the ZZ genotype to review comprehensive care. We further compared the findings in patients treated by different specialists (allergy immunology, gastroenterology, and pulmonary). The data were captured and assessed by using a secure web application for building and managing online surveys and data bases. REDCap. <b>Results:</b> We found a total of 329 patients with diagnostic codes for AATD, of these, 203 patients had a confirmed abnormal genotype. Confirmed genotypes were MZ (n = 69), ZZ (n = 48), MS (n = 22), SZ (n = 22). Further focus was applied to the care of the ZZ population secondary to a predisposition to potential severe lung and liver disease. The findings suggest that care can be improved no matter which specialist cares for the patient. <b>Conclusion:</b> Our study demonstrated that all three subspecialty groups had room for improvement in providing care to patients with AATD. Our study further demonstrated the need for recurrent quality-assurance programs that may be aided by care suggestions built into the EHR."

The molecular switches underlying how the UPR selects for stress adaptation over apoptosis remain unknown. Here, we discovered that accumulation of unfolded/misfolded proteins selectively induces N<sup>6</sup>-adenosine-methyltransferase-14 (METTL14) expression. METTL14 promotes C/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP) mRNA decay through its 3' UTR N<sup>6</sup>-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A) to inhibit its downstream pro-apoptotic target gene expression. UPR induces METTL14 expression by competing against the HRD1-ER-associated degradation (ERAD) machinery to block METTL14 ubiquitination and degradation. Therefore, mice with liver-specific METTL14 deletion are highly susceptible to both acute pharmacological and alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency-induced ER proteotoxic stress and liver injury. Further hepatic CHOP deletion protects METTL14 knockout mice from ER-stress-induced liver damage.

    "abstract": "Functionally active alpha<sub>1</sub>-antitrypsin (AAT) is measured predominantly with a chromogenic elastase inhibition assay, where the concentration of AAT activity inversely correlates with the levels of residual elastase. This standard assay has moderate sensitivity as it hardly allows the measurement of samples containing less than 10 µg of functionally active AAT per mL. To overcome this drawback, we developed a new assay format for the measurement of functionally active AAT, which we termed the elastase complex formation immunosorbent assay (ECFISA). The ECFISA uses plate-bound, still proteolytically active elastase, which attacks functionally active AAT under irreversible formation of a stable stochiometric 1 + 1 complex. This complex is then detected and measured by an anti-AAT peroxidase conjugate. Using three different approaches for the preparation of functionally inactive AAT - heating, oxidation, and complex formation with elastase - we confirmed beyond doubt that the ECFISA exclusively measures functionally active AAT and that these measurements are unimpaired by the presence of high concentrations of functionally inactive AAT. Studies addressing the coating procedure demonstrated that adequate and robust conditions had been defined for this essential first step of the ECFISA. Possible interference caused by the presence of important plasma proteinase inhibitors in the test samples could be excluded for the most abundant inhibitors. Even a 1.5-times molar excess of alpha<sub>2</sub>-macroglobulin over AAT was shown to have no impact, which is not the case for a conventional chromogenic activity assay. Functional activities determined with the ECFISA and validated chromogenic elastase inhibition assay matched well with a mean absolute bias of 0.64% calculated for the 25 samples measured. The results of the bioanalytical assay validation complied with the acceptance criteria for ligand-binding assays as given by current guidelines on validation of bioanalytical methods. Overall, the data obtained demonstrated the ECFISA as an accurate, precise, selective, and very sensitive method for AAT activity measurement at low levels previously inaccessible for direct measurement."

However, the concept of disease phenotypes within AATD (emphysema, chronic bronchitis, bronchiectasis or a combination of phenotypes) has not been proposed or studied. Of the three neutrophil serine proteases, neutrophil elastase was historically believed to be the sole contributor to disease pathology in AATD. Recently, Proteinase-3 has been increasingly studied as an equal, if not greater, contributor to the disease process. Cathepsin G, however, has not been extensively evaluated in this area. Matrix metalloproteinases have also been mentioned in the pathogenesis of AATD but have not been widely explored. This article considers the available evidence for differential protease activity in patients with AATD, including the contribution to distinct phenotypes of the disease. Owing to limited literature in this area, extrapolations from studies of other chronic lung diseases with similar phenotypes, including COPD and bronchiectasis, have been made.

The primary aim of this study is to determine the feasibility of using the electronic medical record (EMR) and linked electronic patient messages (EPM) to encourage AATD testing by patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Study participants were eligible, untested adult patients who were prescribed an inhaled medication which is exclusively Food and Drug Administration-approved for treating COPD. Eligible patients received a message with basic information about AATD and availability of free, home-based AATD testing. Through a collaboration with the Alpha-1 Foundation's Alpha-1 Coded Testing (ACT) study, patients referred to home-based testing through EPM were flagged. The effectiveness of the electronic message was evaluated by the proportion of patients who underwent testing, and the rate of detecting individuals with severe deficiency of AAT among those tested. A total of 12,369 patients on eligible inhalers were screened; 5430 patients met all criteria and received an EPM. During the study, 396 patients (7.3%) fully requested an ACT kit. Of these, 209 patients (52.8%) returned the test sample and received genotyping results; 65.5%, had a normal AAT genotype (PI*MM), 31.6% were heterozygotes for a deficient allele (PI*MS, PI*MZ and PI*M/Null rare), and 2.9% had severe deficiency of alpha-1 antitrypsin (PI*SZ, PI*ZZ, PI*S/Null rare). While the response rate and test return rate were low, the rate of detecting individuals with AATD using this detection strategy exceeds that of many prior strategies.

    "abstract": "α1-anti-trypsin (A1AT), encoded by SERPINA1, is a neutrophil elastase inhibitor that controls the inflammatory response in the lung. Severe A1AT deficiency increases risk for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), however, the role of A1AT in COPD in non-deficient individuals is not well known. We identify a 2.1-fold increase (p = 2.5x10-6) in the use of a distal poly-adenylation site in primary lung tissue RNA-seq in 82 COPD cases when compared to 64 controls and replicate this in an independent study of 376 COPD and 267 controls. This alternative polyadenylation event involves two sites, a proximal and distal site, 61 and 1683 nucleotides downstream of the A1AT stop codon. To characterize this event, we measured the distal ratio in human primary tissue short read RNA-seq data and corroborated our results with long read RNA-seq data. Integrating these results with 3' end RNA-seq and nanoluciferase reporter assay experiments we show that use of the distal site yields mRNA transcripts with over 50-fold decreased translation efficiency and A1AT expression. We identified seven RNA binding proteins using enhanced CrossLinking and ImmunoPrecipitation precipitation (eCLIP) with one or more binding sites in the SERPINA1 3' UTR. We combined these data with measurements of the distal ratio in shRNA knockdown experiments, nuclear and cytoplasmic fractionation, and chemical RNA structure probing. We identify Quaking Homolog (QKI) as a modulator of SERPINA1 mRNA translation and confirm the role of QKI in SERPINA1 translation with luciferase reporter assays. Analysis of single-cell RNA-seq showed differences in the distribution of the SERPINA1 distal ratio among hepatocytes, macrophages, αβ-Tcells and plasma cells in the liver. Alveolar Type 1,2, dendritic cells and macrophages also vary in their distal ratio in the lung. Our work reveals a complex post-transcriptional mechanism that regulates alternative polyadenylation and A1AT expression in COPD."

    "abstract": "Chronic liver diseases are common worldwide, especially in developing countries. The rapid spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)/(COVID-19) leads to the infection of many patients with underlying chronic liver diseases. As a relatively new disease, management of COVID-19, in the context of chronic liver disease, is mainly based on the experience of the treating physician and the available data. In this review, we summarize the available evidence about the management of liver disease patients, in the context of COVID-19 infection, which can increase the severity of viral hepatitis B. Also, its clearance in HBV patients is delayed. A sixfold increased severity of COVID-19 was reported in obese patients with metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFDL). In patients with autoimmune liver disease (AILD), it is not recommended to change their immunosuppressive therapy (as long as they are not infected with COVID-19), in order to avoid a flare of liver disease. However, immunosuppressant drugs should be modified, in the case of infection with COVID-19. To date, no data suggest an increased risk or severity in metabolic liver diseases, such as hemochromatosis, Wilson's disease, or alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. Patients with liver cirrhosis should be carefully managed with minimum exposure to healthcare facilities. Basic investigations for follow-up can be scheduled at wider intervals; if patients need admission, this should be in COVID-19-clean areas. Patients with hepatocellular carcinomas may have a poor prognosis according to preliminary reports from China. The course of COVID-19 in liver transplant recipients on immunosuppression seems to have a benign course, based on few reports in children and adults. The hepatotoxicity of COVID-19 drugs ranges from mild liver enzyme elevation to a flare of underlying liver diseases. Therefore, the decision should be customized. Telemedicine can minimize the exposure of healthcare workers and patients to infection with COVID-19 and decrease the consumption of personal protective equipment."

    "abstract": "Alpha 1 Antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a hereditary condition characterized by low serum Alpha 1 Antitrypsin (AAT) levels and a predisposition towards early-onset emphysema. Infusion of AAT is the only disease-modifying therapy that can sufficiently raise plasma AAT levels above the putative protective threshold and reduce the decline in lung density loss. Several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and registry studies support the clinical efficacy of AAT therapy in slowing the progression of AATD-related emphysema and improving survival outcomes. The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted physicians to develop additional strategies for delivering AAT therapy, which are not only more convenient for the patient, but are \"COVID-19 friendly\", thereby reducing the risk of exposing these vulnerable patients. Intravenous (IV) self-administration of AAT therapy is likely to be beneficial in certain subgroups of patients with AATD and can remove the need for weekly hospital visits, thereby improving independence and well-being. Increasing the awareness of self-administration in AATD through the development of formal guidelines and training programs is required among both physicians and patients and will play an essential role, especially post-COVID-19, in encouraging physicians to consider self-administration for AATD in suitable patients. This review summarizes the benefits of AAT therapy on the clinical endpoints of mortality and quality of life (QoL) and discusses the benefits of self-administration therapy compared with conventional therapy administered by a healthcare professional. In addition, this review highlights the challenges of providing AAT therapy during the COVID-19 pandemic and the potential considerations for its implementation thereafter."

    "abstract": "During biosynthesis, proteins can begin folding co-translationally to acquire their biologically-active structures. Folding, however, is an imperfect process and in many cases misfolding results in disease. Less is understood of how misfolding begins during biosynthesis. The human protein, alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT) folds under kinetic control via a folding intermediate; its pathological variants readily form self-associated polymers at the site of synthesis, leading to alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency. We observe that AAT nascent polypeptides stall during their biosynthesis, resulting in full-length nascent chains that remain bound to ribosome, forming a persistent ribosome-nascent chain complex (RNC) prior to release. We analyse the structure of these RNCs, which reveals compacted, partially-folded co-translational folding intermediates possessing molten-globule characteristics. We find that the highly-polymerogenic mutant, Z AAT, forms a distinct co-translational folding intermediate relative to wild-type. Its very modest structural differences suggests that the ribosome uniquely tempers the impact of deleterious mutations during nascent chain emergence. Following nascent chain release however, these co-translational folding intermediates guide post-translational folding outcomes thus suggesting that Z's misfolding is initiated from co-translational structure. Our findings demonstrate that co-translational folding intermediates drive how some proteins fold under kinetic control, and may thus also serve as tractable therapeutic targets for human disease."

    "title": "Designing Clinical Trials in \"Regular\" COPD Versus Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency-Associated COPD: \"More Alike Than Unalike?\".",
    "abstract": "Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) predisposes to emphysema, liver disease, and panniculitis. This emphysema risk naturally invites a comparison between \"regular\" chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (i.e., unrelated to AATD) and AATD-associated emphysema. Several features characterize both conditions. Both can be life-limiting and highly debilitating. Both are highly under-recognized. An important corollary of this comparison between \"regular\" COPD and AATD-associated COPD is whether both should be treated similarly and whether clinical trials to assess new therapies can be conducted similarly in both. Here, the distinctions between \"regular\" COPD and AATD-associated COPD are quite pronounced. Therapeutically, sparse available data suggest that lung volume reduction surgery confers less improvement in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) in AATD and that such benefits are shorter-lived. Perhaps the most striking contrast between the 2 conditions is that clinical trial designs and conduct are necessarily very different. The relative scarcity of diagnosed individuals with AATD hampers recruitment to trials. Furthermore, primary outcome measures in trials of \"regular\" COPD must differ markedly from those of AATD-associated emphysema. Specifically, power calculations show that FEV1 and exacerbation frequency, which are amply represented as endpoints in large COPD trials, are infeasible in studies of AATD-associated emphysema. Rather, in the 3 available randomized controlled trials of intravenous augmentation therapy, the rate of emphysema progression based on serial computed tomography densitometry measurements has been the only feasible primary outcome measure. These considerations underscore the distinctive challenges and needs of conducting treatment trials in AATD-associated emphysema and emphasize that, with regard to clinical study design, the 2 conditions are \"more unalike than alike.\""

Participants with Alagille syndrome (ALGS), progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC), and alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency (A1AT) enrolled in a longitudinal, multicenter study and completed the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence-III or Intelligence Scale for Children-IV. Full Scale Intelligence Quotient (FSIQ) was analyzed continuously and categorically (>100, 85-99, 70-84, <70). Univariate linear regression was performed to study association between FSIQ and risk factors, stratified by disease. Two hundred and fifteen completed testing (ALGS n = 70, PFIC n = 43, A1AT n = 102); median age was 7.6 years (3.0-16.9). Mean FSIQ in ALGS was lower than A1AT (94 vs 101, P = 0.01). Frequency of FSIQ < 85 (>1 standard deviation [SD] below average) was highest in ALGS (29%) versus 18.6% in PFIC and 12.8% in A1AT, and was greater than expected in ALGS based on normal distribution (29% vs 15.9%, P = 0.003). ALGS scored significantly lower than test norms in almost all Wechsler composites; A1AT scored lower on Working Memory and Processing Speed; PFIC was not different from test norms. Total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, albumin, hemoglobin, and parental education were significantly associated with FSIQ. Patients with ALGS are at increased risk of lower FSIQ, whereas our data suggest A1AT and PFIC are not. A1AT and ALGS appear vulnerable to working memory and processing speed deficits suggestive of attention/executive function impairment. Malnutrition, liver disease severity, and sociodemographic factors appear related to FSIQ deficits, potentially identifying targets for early interventions."

    "abstract": "Exosomes are nano-sized vesicles released by almost all cell types, with a central role as mediators of intercellular communication. In addition to physiological conditions, these extracellular vesicles seem to play a pivotal role in inflammatory processes. This assumption offers the opportunity to study exosomes as promising biomarkers and therapeutic tools for chronic respiratory disorders. Indeed, although it is well-known that at the basis of conditions like asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis there is a dysregulated inflammatory process, an unequivocal correlation between different phenotypes and their pathophysiological mechanisms has not been established yet. In this review, we report and discuss some of the most significant studies on exosomes from body fluids of subjects affected by airway diseases. Furthermore, the most widespread techniques for exosome isolation and characterization are described. Further studies are needed to answer the unresolved questions about the functional link between exosomes and chronic respiratory diseases."

    "abstract": "Several comorbidities including diabetes, immune deficiency, and chronic respiratory disorders increase the risk of severe Covid-19 and fatalities among SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. Severe Covid-19 risk among diabetes patients may reflect reduced immune response to viral infections. SARS-CoV-2 initially infects respiratory tract epithelial cells by binding to the host cell membrane ACE2, followed by proteolytic priming for cell entry by the host cell membrane serine protease TMPRSS2. Additionally, the protease FURIN facilitates cell exit of mature SARS-CoV-2 virions. Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT), the major plasma serine protease inhibitor, encoded by SERPINA1, is known to promote immune response to viral infections. AAT inhibits neutrophil elastase, a key inflammatory serine protease implicated in alveolar cell damage during respiratory infections, and AAT deficiency is associated with susceptibility to lung infections. AAT is implicated in Covid-19 as it inhibits TMPRSS2, a protease essential for SARS-CoV-2 cell entry. Here we show that treatment of A549 human lung epithelial cells for 7 days with 25 mM d-galactose, an inducer of diabetic-like and oxidative stress cellular phenotypes, leads to increased mRNA levels of ACE2, TMPRSS2, and FURIN, along with reduced SERPINA1 mRNA. Together, the dysregulated transcription of these genes following d-galactose treatment suggests that chronic diabetic-like conditions may facilitate SARS-CoV-2 infection of lung epithelial cells. Our findings may in part explain the higher severe Covid-19 risk in diabetes, and highlight the need to develop special treatment protocols for diabetic patients."

    "abstract": "Alpha-1 Antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a genetic condition that can lead to Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. The burden of psychological disease, its impact and contributing factors in patients with AATD are largely unknown. This study determined the prevalence of depression and anxiety in AATD and its clinical impact. All subjects with PiZZ/PiZnull (<i>n</i> = 635) and PiSZ (<i>n</i> = 111) genotypes within the AATD registry who had sufficient data to calculate pulmonary physiological and health status (HS) decline were grouped as those with or without a diagnosis of depression and/or anxiety. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed on physiological, demographic and HS parameters. Depression and/or anxiety was present in 16.4% overall in both PiSZ and PiZZ/PiZnull cohorts and was associated with lower baseline pulmonary function and worse HS. In the multivariable analysis of the PiZZ/PiZnull cohort, a greater average decline in FEV<sub>1</sub>% predicted was observed in those with depression and/or anxiety than those without (-1.53 SD ± 2.26 per year, -0.99 ± 1.79, respectively; <i>p</i> = 0.03) but there was no difference in HS decline (<i>p</i> = 0.33). No differences were seen in the PiSZ cohort. Dyspnoea (mMRC score) was generally worse in those with depression and/or anxiety than those without. Comorbidity burden did not differ between those with or without depression and/or anxiety. Disease severity and progression may be contributing to the prevalence of psychological factors in PiZZ/PiZnull patients. Patients who are declining rapidly should be actively monitored for psychological co-morbidity and treated by cognitive or pharmacological means.Supplemental data for this article is available online at https://doi.org/10.1080/15412555.2021.1991904 ."

To test the hypothesis that the α<sub>1</sub> -antitrypsin Z genetic variant is associated with increased risk of venous thromboembolism. A total of 107 075 individuals from the Copenhagen General Population Study were used to test the association of the α<sub>1</sub> -antitrypsin Z genetic variant with risk of venous thromboembolism, including deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, prospectively. Confirmatory analyses were done in the UK Biobank. During follow-up, venous thromboembolism was diagnosed 6649 times in noncarriers, 436 times in heterozygotes, and 10 times in homozygotes. Hazard ratios for venous thromboembolism in α<sub>1</sub> -antitrypsin Z heterozygotes and homozygotes versus noncarriers were 1.1 (95% confidence interval, 1.0-1.2) and 2.2 (1.3-3.7). A one Z allele increase was associated with a hazard ratio for venous thromboembolism of 1.2 (1.0-1.3). The corresponding odds ratio in the UK Biobank was 1.2 (1.1-1.3). The absolute risk of venous thromboembolism associated with α<sub>1</sub> -antitrypsin ZZ homozygosity was 7.8% (3.6-12.1). The corresponding estimates were 20.1% (9.1-31.2) for prothrombin G20210A and 15.0% (12.6-17.4) for factor V Leiden. The fraction of venous thromboembolic events attributable to the α<sub>1</sub> -antitrypsin Z allele was 0.7% (0.1-1.3). For the prothrombin G20210A and factor V Leiden mutations, population attributable fractions were 1.2% (0.9-1.6) and 10.5% (9.9-11.1).

    "abstract": "Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is an autosomal co-dominant condition that predisposes to emphysema, cirrhosis, panniculitis, and vasculitis. Underrecognition has prompted efforts to enhance early detection and testing of at-risk individuals. Direct-to-consumer (DTC) genetic testing represents an additional method of detection. The study addressed three questions: (1) Does a DTC testing service identify previously undetected individuals with AATD? (2) What was the interval between initial AATD-related symptoms and initial diagnosis of AATD in such individuals? and (3) What was the behavioral impact of learning about a new diagnosis of AATD through a DTC test? In this cross-sectional study, 195,014 individuals responded to a survey within the 23andMe, Inc. research platform. Among 195,014 study participants, the allele frequency for the PI∗S and PI∗Z AATD variants was 21.6% (6.5% for PI∗Z and 15.1% for PI∗S); 0.63% were PI∗ZZ, half of whom reported having a physician confirm the diagnosis. Approximately 27% of those with physician-diagnosed AATD reported first becoming aware of AATD through the DTC test. Among those newly aware participants, the diagnostic delay interval was 22.3 years. Participants frequently shared their DTC test results with health care providers (HCPs) and the reported impact of learning a diagnosis of AATD was high. For example, 51.1% of PI∗ZZ individuals shared their DTC result with an HCP. The OR for PI∗ZZ smokers to report smoking reduction as a result of receiving the DTC result was 1.7 (95% CI = 1.4-2.2) compared with those without a Z allele and for reduced alcohol consumption this was 4.0 (95% CI = 2.6-5.9). In this largest available report on DTC testing for AATD, this test, in combination with clinical follow-up, can help to identify previously undiagnosed AATD patients. Moreover, receipt of the DTC AATD report was associated with positive behavior change, especially among those with risk variants."

    "abstract": "In this review, we will discuss the current status and recent developments in precision medicine in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) through the lens of treatable traits. Although the term 'treatable traits' in the treatment of COPD is relatively recent, this concept has been used for many years if one considers interventions such as long-term oxygen therapy or alpha-1 antitrypsin replacement therapy. Recent advances have included expanding the definition of COPD to include a broader population of people with lower respiratory disease but not meeting the strict criteria for obstruction, advances in imaging to aid in the diagnosis and treatment of COPD, advances in understanding symptoms and exacerbations to define severity, using biomarkers to guide therapy and better understanding and addressing polymorbidity and frailty. In addition, there is a concerted effort to use these concepts to identify COPD patients earlier in the disease process wherein disease modification may be possible. Focusing on subsets of patients with COPD with certain characteristics should lead to better outcomes and fewer adverse effects from treatment. http://links.lww.com/COPM/A30."

It may have serious consequences for a pregnancy, including increased risk of preterm delivery, meconium staining of amniotic fluid, fetal bradycardia, distress, and fetal demise. In cases of high bile acids (>100μmol/L), patients have 10-fold increase in the risk of stillbirth. Biophysical methods of fetal monitoring, such as cardiotocography, ultrasonography, or Doppler have been proven unreliable for risk prediction in the course of intrahepatic cholestasis. Therefore, we believe extensive research for more specific, especially early, markers should be carried out. By analogy with cholestasis in children with inherited alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD), we hypothesized the <i>SERPINA1</i> Z pathogenic variant might be related to a higher risk of cholestasis in pregnancy. This study aimed to investigate the most common AATD variants (Z and S SERPINA1 alleles) in a group of cholestatic pregnant women. <b>Results:</b> The Z carrier frequency was calculated to be 6.8%, which is much higher compared to the general population [2.3%; the Chi-squared test with Yates correction is 6.8774 (<i>p</i>=0.008)]. <b>Conclusion:</b> Increased prevalence of <i>SERPINA1</i> PI*Z variant in a group of women with intrahepatic cholestasis may suggest a possible genetic origin of a higher risk of intrahepatic cholestasis in pregnancy."

However, a growing number of studies show that MZ carriers have an increased risk of developing lung and liver diseases, if exposed to smoking or other airborne or industrial pollutants, and hepatotoxic substances. We used the epidemiological studies performed to determine the frequencies of PiM and PiZ worldwide, based on the following criteria: 1) samples representative of the general population; 2) AAT phenotyping or genotyping characterized by adequate methods, including isoelectric focusing and polymerase chain reaction; and 3) studies with reliable results assessed with a coefficient of variation calculated from the sample size and 95% confidence intervals, to measure the precision of the results in terms of dispersion of the data around the mean. The present review reveals an impressive number of MZs of more than 35 million in 74 countries of the world with available data. Seventy-five percent of them are people of Caucasian European heritage, mostly living in Europe, America, Australia and New Zealand. Twenty percent of the remaining MZs live in Asia, with the highest concentrations in the Middle East, Eastern¸ Southern, and South-eastern regions of the Asian continent. The remaining five percent are Africans residing in Western and Eastern Africa. Considering the high rate of smoking, the outdoor and the indoor air pollution from solid fuels used in cooking and heating, and the exposure to industrial dusts and chemicals in many of these countries, these figures are very worrying, and hence the importance of adequately assessing MZ subjects, recommending them rigorous preventive measures based on the adoption of healthy lifestyles, including avoidance of smoking and alcohol."

The relevance of circulating polymers (CP) of AAT in the pathogenesis of lung and liver disease is not completely understood. Therefore, the main objective of our study was to determine whether there is an association between the levels of CP of AAT and the severity of lung and liver disease. This was a cross-sectional study in patients with different phenotypes of AATD and controls. To quantify CP, a sandwich ELISA was performed using the 2C1 monoclonal antibody against AAT polymers. Sociodemographic data, clinical characteristics, and liver and lung parameters were collected. A cohort of 70 patients was recruited: 32 Pi*ZZ (11 on augmentation therapy); 29 Z-heterozygous; 9 with other genotypes. CP were compared with a control group of 47 individuals (35 Pi*MM and 12 Pi*MS). ZZ patients had the highest concentrations of CP (p < 0.001) followed by Z heterozygous. The control group and patients with Pi*SS and Pi*SI had the lowest CP concentrations. Pi*ZZ also had higher levels of liver stiffness measurements (LSM) than the remaining AATD patients. Among patients with one or two Z alleles, two patients with lung and liver impairment showed the highest concentrations of CP (47.5 µg/mL), followed by those with only liver abnormality (n = 6, CP = 34 µg/mL), only lung (n = 18, CP = 26.5 µg/mL) and no abnormalities (n = 23, CP = 14.3 µg/mL). Differences were highly significant (p = 0.004). Non-augmented Pi*ZZ and Z-patients with impaired lung function and increased liver stiffness presented higher levels of CP than other clinical phenotypes. Therefore, CP may help to identify patients more at risk of developing lung and liver disease and may provide some insight into the mechanisms of disease."

The study aimed to assess the presence of small airways dysfunction and the potential correlation with the presence of Z-AAT polymers obtained by Exhaled Breath Condensate (EBC) collection in PiZZ subjects, as compared with matched healthy PiMM subjects. We enrolled 19 asymptomatic, never smoker subjects: 9 PiZZ and 10 PiMM as controls, without obstructive ventilatory defect (i.e., normal FEV1/VC% ratio). All subjects underwent complete pulmonary function tests (PFT). EBC was collected in all subjects. ELISA test was applied to search for Z-AAT polymers. The PiZZ subjects showed normal lung volumes and DLCO values. However, in comparison with PiMM subjects, the single breath test N2 wash-out revealed significant differences regarding the phase III slope (1.45±0.35 N2/L vs. 0.96±0.40 N2/L) (p<0.02) in the PiZZ subjects, while the closing volume/vital capacity ratio (14.3±4.5 % vs. 11.3±6.3 %) was not significantly increased. The ELISA test detected the presence of Z-AAT polymers in 44% of PiZZ patients. Asymptomatic, never smoker PiZZ subjects with normal spirometry and lung diffusion capacity showed airways impairment when compared to PiMM subjects. Although Z-AAT polymers were found only in 44% of PiZZ subjects, these findings suggest the possibility that chronic bronchiolitis can develop as a result of the long-term pro-inflammatory activity of Z-AAT polymers in subjects with Z-related AATD."

Vitamin D synthesis is initiated following skin exposure to sunlight, however nutritional supplementation can be required to address deficiency, for example during the winter months or due to cultural constraints. We recently reported that 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D3) treatment induced alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) expression in CD4+, but not CD8+ T cells, with evidence supporting an immunoregulatory role. <b>Research Question:</b> To understand the relationship between vitamin D, lung AAT levels and T lymphocytes further we investigated whether TGF-β is required as a co-factor for 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D3-induced upregulation of AAT by vitamin D in CD8+ T cells <i>in vitro</i> and correlated circulating vitamin D levels with lung AAT levels <i>in vivo</i>. <b>Results:</b> 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D3 in combination with TGF-β1 increased AAT expression by CD8+ T cells, as well as <i>VDR</i> and <i>RXR</i>α gene expression, which may partly explain the requirement for TGF-β. CD4+ T cells may also require autocrine stimulation with TGF-β as a co-factor since 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D3 was associated with increased TGF-β bioactivity and neutralisation of TGF-β partially abrogated 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D3-induced <i>SERPINA1</i> gene expression. Neither CD4+ nor CD8+ T cells responded to the circulating vitamin D precursor, 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 for induction of <i>SERPINA1</i>, suggesting that local generation of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D3 is required. Transcriptional gene profiling studies previously demonstrated that human bronchial epithelial cells rapidly increased TGF-β2 gene expression in response to 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D3. Here, human epithelial cells responded to precursor 25(OH)D3 to increase bioactive TGF-β synthesis. CD8+ T cells responded comparably to TGF-β1 and TGF-β2 to increase 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D3-induced AAT. However, CD8+ T cells from adults with AAT-deficiency, homozygous for the Z allele of <i>SERPINA1</i>, were unable to mount this response. AAT levels in the airways of children with asthma and controls correlated with circulating 25(OH)D3. <b>Conclusions:</b> Vitamin D increases AAT expression in human T cells and this response is impaired in T cells from individuals homozygous for the Z allele of <i>SERPINA1</i> in a clinic population. Furthermore, a correlation between circulating vitamin D and airway AAT is reported. We propose that vitamin D-induced AAT contributes to local immunomodulation and airway health effects previously attributed to vitamin D."

    "title": "Investigating the Link between Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency and Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms.",
    "abstract": "Alpha-1-Antitrypsin (AAT) is one of the major plasmatic protease inhibitors. In the last decade, an association between Alpha-1-Antitrypsin Deficiency (AATD) and Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms (AAA) has been hypothesized. Multiple factors may be involved in AAA's etiopathogenesis, and an underlying structural defect of the extracellular matrix (ECM) is always present. AATD could be a reasonable risk factor for AAA because it is related to protease/antiprotease imbalance and enhanced ECM degradation of the vessel wall. We performed genotyping of 138 patients hospitalized in the Vascular Surgery Division of the ASST-Spedali Civili di Brescia, Italy, for nontraumatic rupture of AAA. The second purpose was to observe the distribution of main nongenetic risk factors for AAA between patients with and without AATD. Out of 138 patients, 22 were found with AATD: 16 MS, 1 SS, 3 MZ, and 2 with a new rare AAT variant. When compared to the general Italian population, our cohort's frequency of deficient S allele was significantly higher (7.8 vs. 2.2% respectively, P < 0.01), whereas the deficient Z allele was similar (1.1 vs. 1.3% respectively, P > 0.05). Although we found no differences in age, gender, hypertension, diabetes, and smoke habits between AAA patients with and without AATD, hyperlipidemia was significantly less frequent in patients with AATD (46.4 vs. 12.5% respectively, P < 0.05). In our AAA patients' cohort, the S allele frequency was higher than in the general Italian population. Our results support the hypothesis that AATD might be a risk factor for AAA."

    "abstract": "In vitro-transcribed (IVT) mRNA has come into focus in recent years as a potential therapeutic approach for the treatment of genetic diseases. The nebulized formulations of IVT-mRNA-encoding alpha-1-antitrypsin (A1AT-mRNA) would be a highly acceptable and tolerable remedy for the protein replacement therapy for alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency in the future. Here we show that lipoplexes containing A1AT-mRNA prepared in optimum conditions could successfully transfect human bronchial epithelial cells without significant toxicity. A reduction in transfection efficiency was observed for aerosolized lipoplexes that can be partially overcome by increasing the initial number of components. A1AT produced from cells transfected by nebulized A1AT-mRNA lipoplexes is functional and could successfully inhibit the enzyme activity of trypsin as well as elastase. Our data indicate that aerosolization of A1AT-mRNA therapy constitutes a potentially powerful means to transfect airway epithelial cells with the purpose of producing functional A1AT, while bringing along the unique advantages of IVT-mRNA."

    "title": "Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Augmentation Inhibits Proteolysis of Neutrophil Membrane Voltage-Gated Proton Channel-1 in Alpha-1 Deficient Individuals.",
    "abstract": "<i>Background and Objectives</i>: Alpha-1 antitrypsin is a serine protease inhibitor that demonstrates an array of immunomodulatory functions. Individuals with the genetic condition of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) are at increased risk of early onset emphysematous lung disease. This lung disease is partly driven by neutrophil mediated lung destruction in an environment of low AAT. As peripheral neutrophil hyper-responsiveness in AATD leads to excessive degranulation and increased migration to the airways, we examined the expression of the membrane voltage-gated proton channel-1 (HVCN1), which is integrally linked to neutrophil function. The objectives of this study were to evaluate altered HVCN1 in AATD neutrophils, serine protease-dependent degradation of HVCN1, and to investigate the ability of serum AAT to control HVCN1 expression. <i>Materials and Methods</i>: Circulating neutrophils were purified from AATD patients (<i>n</i> = 20), AATD patients receiving AAT augmentation therapy (<i>n</i> = 3) and healthy controls (<i>n</i> = 20). HVCN1 neutrophil expression was assessed by flow cytometry and Western blot analysis. Neutrophil membrane bound elastase was measured by fluorescence resonance energy transfer. <i>Results</i>: In this study we demonstrated that HVCN1 protein is under-expressed in AATD neutrophils (<i>p</i> = 0.02), suggesting a link between reduced HVCN1 expression and AAT deficiency. We have demonstrated that HVCN1 undergoes significant proteolytic degradation in activated neutrophils (<i>p</i> < 0.0001), primarily due to neutrophil elastase activity (<i>p</i> = 0.0004). In addition, the treatment of AATD individuals with AAT augmentation therapy increased neutrophil plasma membrane HVCN1 expression (<i>p</i> = 0.01). <i>Conclusions</i>: Our results demonstrate reduced levels of HVCN1 in peripheral blood neutrophils that may influence the neutrophil-dominated immune response in the AATD airways and highlights the role of antiprotease treatment and specifically AAT augmentation therapy in protecting neutrophil membrane expression of HVCN1."

    "title": "How Do Mechanics Guide Fibroblast Activity? Complex Disruptions during Emphysema Shape Cellular Responses and Limit Research.",
    "abstract": "The emphysema death toll has steadily risen over recent decades, causing the disease to become the third most common cause of death worldwide in 2019. Emphysema is currently incurable and could be due to a genetic condition (Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency) or exposure to pollutants/irritants, such as cigarette smoke or poorly ventilated cooking fires. Despite the growing burden of emphysema, the mechanisms behind emphysematous pathogenesis and progression are not fully understood by the scientific literature. A key aspect of emphysematous progression is the destruction of the lung parenchyma extracellular matrix (ECM), causing a drastic shift in the mechanical properties of the lung (known as mechanobiology). The mechanical properties of the lung such as the stiffness of the parenchyma (measured as the elastic modulus) and the stretch forces required for inhalation and exhalation are both reduced in emphysema. Fibroblasts function to maintain the structural and mechanical integrity of the lung parenchyma, yet, in the context of emphysema, these fibroblasts appear incapable of repairing the ECM, allowing emphysema to progress. This relationship between the disturbances in the mechanical cues experienced by an emphysematous lung and fibroblast behaviour is constantly overlooked and consequently understudied, thus warranting further research. Interestingly, the failure of current research models to integrate the altered mechanical environment of an emphysematous lung may be limiting our understanding of emphysematous pathogenesis and progression, potentially disrupting the development of novel treatments. This review will focus on the significance of emphysematous lung mechanobiology to fibroblast activity and current research limitations by examining: (1) the impact of mechanical cues on fibroblast activity and the cell cycle, (2) the potential role of mechanical cues in the diminished activity of emphysematous fibroblasts and, finally, (3) the limitations of current emphysematous lung research models and treatments as a result of the overlooked emphysematous mechanical environment."

To compare the trajectory of FEV<sub>1</sub> change during 4 or more years in ZZ-AATD patients with emphysema receiving or not receiving intravenous augmentation therapy, a retrospective analysis of FEV<sub>1</sub> values entered in the Alpha-1 International Registry (AIR) of ZZ-AATD patients from five different European countries (Germany, UK, Spain, Italy and the Netherlands) was performed. The post-bronchodilator FEV<sub>1</sub> % predicted values for baseline and follow-up over time from patients were analysed using linear mixed effects models. Data of 374 patients were analysed: 246 untreated and 128 treated with intravenous AAT augmentation therapy. The mean±sd follow-up duration of the untreated group was 8.60±3.34 years and 8.59±2.62 years for the treated group. The mixed effects model analysis showed a mean FEV<sub>1</sub> decline of -0.931% predicted per year (95% CI -1.144 to -0.718) in the untreated group and a decline of -1.016% predicted per year (95% CI -1.319 to -0.7145) in the treated group. The likelihood ratio test showed no difference between the two groups (p=0.71). In our study population, we could not detect a significant difference in the annual decline of FEV<sub>1</sub> by AAT augmentation treatment over a mean period of 8.6 years. Other approaches are needed to validate any benefit of augmentation therapy."

    "abstract": "The serpin family A member 1 (<i>SERPINA1</i>) Z allele is present in approximately one in 25 individuals of European ancestry. Z allele homozygosity (Pi*ZZ) is the most common cause of alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency and is a proven risk factor for cirrhosis. We examined whether heterozygous Z allele (Pi*Z) carriers in United Kingdom (UK) Biobank, a population-based cohort, are at increased risk of liver disease. We replicated findings in Massachusetts General Brigham Biobank, a hospital-based cohort. We also examined variants associated with liver disease and assessed for gene-gene and gene-environment interactions. In UK Biobank, we identified 1,493 cases of cirrhosis, 12,603 Z allele heterozygotes, and 129 Z allele homozygotes among 312,671 unrelated white British participants. Heterozygous carriage of the Z allele was associated with cirrhosis compared to noncarriage (odds ratio [OR], 1.53; <i>P</i> = 1.1×10<sup>-04</sup>); homozygosity of the Z allele also increased the risk of cirrhosis (OR, 11.8; <i>P</i> = 1.8 × 10<sup>-09</sup>). The OR for cirrhosis of the Z allele was comparable to that of well-established genetic variants, including patatin-like phospholipase domain containing 3 (<i>PNPLA3</i>) I148M (OR, 1.48; <i>P</i> = 1.1 × 10<sup>-22</sup>) and transmembrane 6 superfamily member 2 (<i>TM6SF2</i>) E167K (OR, 1.34; <i>P</i> = 2.6 × 10<sup>-06</sup>). In heterozygotes compared to noncarriers, the Z allele was associated with higher alanine aminotransferase (ALT; <i>P</i> = = 4.6 × 10<sup>-46</sup>), aspartate aminotransferase (AST; <i>P</i> = 2.2 × 10<sup>-27</sup>), alkaline phosphatase (<i>P</i> = 3.3 × 10<sup>-43</sup>), gamma-glutamyltransferase (<i>P</i> = 1.2 × 10<sup>-05</sup>), and total bilirubin (<i>P</i> = 6.4 × 10<sup>-06</sup>); Z allele homozygotes had even greater elevations in liver biochemistries. Body mass index (BMI) amplified the association of the Z allele for ALT (<i>P</i> interaction = 0.021) and AST (<i>P</i> interaction = 0.0040), suggesting a gene-environment interaction. Finally, we demonstrated genetic interactions between variants in <i>PNPLA3</i>, <i>TM6SF2,</i> and hydroxysteroid 17-beta dehydrogenase 13 (<i>HSD17B13</i>); there was no evidence of epistasis between the Z allele and these variants. <i>Conclusion:</i> <i>SERPINA1</i> Z allele heterozygosity is an important risk factor for liver disease; this risk is amplified by increasing BMI."

    "title": "Imaging in alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency: a window into the disease.",
    "abstract": "Imaging modalities such as plain chest radiograph and computed tomography (CT) are important tools in the assessment of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) of any etiology. These methods facilitate differential diagnoses and the assessment of individual lung pathologies, such as the presence of emphysema, bullae, or fibrosis. However, as emphysema is the core pathological consequence in the lungs of patients with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD), and because AATD is associated with the development of other lung pathologies such as bronchiectasis, there is a greater need for patients with AATD than those with non-AATD-related COPD to undergo more detailed assessment using CT. In the field of AATD, CT provides essential information regarding the presence, distribution, and morphology of emphysema. In addition, it offers the option to quantify the extent of emphysema. These data have implications for treatment decisions such as initiation of alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) therapy, or suitability for surgical or endoscopic interventions for reducing lung volume. Furthermore, CT has provided vital insight regarding the natural history of emphysema progression in AATD, and CT densitometry has underpinned research into the efficacy of AAT therapy. Moving forward, hyperpolarized xenon gas (<sup>129</sup>Xe) lung magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is emerging as a promising complement to CT by adding comprehensive measures of regional lung function. It also avoids the main disadvantage of CT: the associated radiation. This chapter provides an overview of technological aspects of imaging in AATD, as well as its role in the management of patients and clinical research. In addition, perspectives on the future potential role of lung MRI in AATD are outlined."

    "abstract": "Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is caused by mutations in the <i>SERPINA1</i> gene, which encodes the alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) protein. Currently, over 200 <i>SERPINA1</i> variants have been identified, many of which cause the quantitative and/or qualitative changes in AAT responsible for AATD-associated lung and liver disease. The types of these pathogenic mutations are varied, often resulting in misfolding, or truncating of the AAT amino acid sequence, and improvements in sequencing technology are helping to identify known and novel genetic variants. However, due to the diversity and novelty of rare variants, the clinical significance of many is largely unknown. There is, therefore, a lack of guidance on how patients should be monitored and treated when the clinical significance of their variant combination is unclear or variable. Nevertheless, it is important that physicians understand the advantages and disadvantages of the different testing methodologies available to diagnose AATD. Owing to the autosomal inheritance of the genetic mutations responsible for AATD, genetic testing should be offered not only to patients at increased AATD risk (e.g. patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), but also to relatives of those with an abnormal result. Genetic counseling may help patients and family members understand the possible outcomes of testing and the implications for the family. While stress/anxiety can arise from genetic diagnosis or confirmation of carrier status, there can be positive consequences to genetic testing, including improved lifestyle choices, directed medical care, and empowered family planning. As genetic testing technology grows and becomes more popular, testing without physician referral is becoming more prevalent, irrespective of the availability of genetic counseling. Therefore, the Alpha-1 Foundation offers genetic counseling, as well as other support and educational material, for patients with AATD, as well as their families and physicians, to help improve the understanding of potential benefits and consequences of genetic testing."

    "abstract": "Intravenous infusion of alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat emphysema associated with AAT deficiency (AATD) in 1987 and there are now several FDA-approved therapy products on the market, all of which are derived from pooled human plasma. Intravenous AAT therapy has proven clinical efficacy in slowing the decline of lung function associated with AATD progression; however, it is only recommended for individuals with the most severe forms of AATD as there is a lack of evidence that this treatment is effective in treating wild-type heterozygotes (e.g., PI*MS and PI*MZ genotypes), for which the prevalence may be much higher than previously thought. There are large numbers of individuals that are currently left untreated despite displaying symptoms of AATD. Furthermore, not all countries offer AAT augmentation therapy due to its expense and inconvenience for patients. More cost-effective treatments are now being sought that show efficacy for less severe forms of AATD and many new therapeutic technologies are being investigated, such as gene repair and other interference strategies, as well as the use of chemical chaperones. New sources of AAT are also being investigated to ensure there are enough supplies to meet future demand, and new methods of assessing response to treatment are being evaluated. There is currently extensive research into AATD and its treatment, and this chapter aims to highlight important emerging treatment strategies that aim to improve the lives of patients with AATD."

    "abstract": "Management of lung disease in patients with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) includes both non-pharmacological and pharmacological approaches. Lifestyle changes with avoidance of environmental pollutants, including tobacco smoke, improving exercise levels and nutritional status, all encompassed under a disease management program, are crucial pillars of AATD management. Non-pharmacological therapies follow conventional treatment guidelines for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Specific pharmacological treatment consists of administering exogenous alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) protein intravenously (augmentation therapy). This intervention raises AAT levels in serum and lung epithelial lining fluid, increases anti-elastase capacity, and decreases several inflammatory mediators in the lung. Radiologically, augmentation therapy reduces lung density loss over time, thus delaying disease progression. The effect of augmentation therapy on other lung-related outcomes, such as exacerbation frequency/length, quality of life, lung function decline, and mortality, are less clear and questions regarding dose optimization or route of administration are still debatable. This review discusses the rationale and available evidence for these interventions in AATD."

    "title": "Lung and liver transplantation in patients with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency.",
    "abstract": "Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) augmentation is effective in slowing the progression of emphysema due to AAT deficiency (AATD) but cannot prevent eventual progression to end-stage lung disease and complete respiratory failure, which is the leading cause of death for individuals with severe AATD. When patients develop end-stage lung disease, lung transplantation is the only treatment option available, and this can improve lung physiology and patient health status. The available data suggest that survival rates for lung transplantation are significantly higher for patients with AATD-related chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) compared with non-AATD-related COPD, but, conversely, there is a higher risk of common post-lung transplant complications in patients with AATD <i>versus</i> non-AATD COPD. Nevertheless, lung transplantation (single and bilateral) is favorable for patients with AATD. After respiratory failure, the second leading cause of death in patients with AATD is liver disease, for example, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, caused by the accumulation of mutant forms of AAT retained within the liver. As with lung disease, the only treatment option for end-stage liver disease is liver transplantation. Survival rates for patients with AATD undergoing liver transplantation are also favorable, and patients, particularly pediatric patients, have benefitted from advancements in peri-/post-surgical care. As the majority of AAT is produced by the liver, the AAT phenotype of the recipient becomes that of the donor, meaning that AAT serum levels should be normalized (if the donor is AAT-replete), halting further lung and liver disease progression. However, post-liver transplant respiratory function may continue to decline in line with normal age-related lung function decline. In the most severe cases, where patients have simultaneous end-stage lung and liver disease, combined lung and liver transplantation is a treatment option with favorable outcomes. However, there is very little information available on this procedure in patients with AATD."

    "abstract": "Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency (AATD) is an autosomal co-dominant condition that predisposes to the development of lung disease, primarily emphysema. Emphysema results from the breakdown of lung matrix elastin by proteases, including neutrophil elastase, a protease normally inhibited by AAT. AATD also predisposes to liver (cirrhosis) and skin (panniculitis) disease, and to vasculitis. The prevalence of AATD is estimated to be approximately 1 in 3,500 individuals in the United States. However, lack of awareness of AATD among some physicians, misperceptions regarding the absence of effective therapy, and the close overlap in symptoms with asthma and non-AATD chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are thought to contribute to under-recognition of the disease. In patients with AATD, treatment with intravenous AAT augmentation therapy is the only currently available treatment known to slow the progression of emphysema. Moreover, smoking cessation and other lifestyle interventions also help improve outcomes. Early diagnosis and intervention are of key importance due to the irreversible nature of the resultant emphysema. Liver disease is the second leading cause of death among patients with AATD and a minority of patients present with panniculitis or antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis, thought to be directly related to AATD. Though no randomized trial has assessed the effectiveness of augmentation therapy for AATD-associated panniculitis, clinical experience and case series suggest there is a benefit. Other diseases putatively linked to AATD include aneurysmal disease and multiple neurological conditions, although these associations remain speculative in nature."

    "abstract": "Although a less well-known consequence of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) liver disease is the second leading cause of death among patients with the condition. The alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) protein is produced by hepatocytes within the liver, which retain pathological variants of AAT instead of secreting the proteinase inhibitor into the systemic circulation. This intracellular retention is caused by inefficient folding and polymerization of mutant AAT and the accumulation of these AAT aggregates leads to diverse manifestations of liver disease, which can present differently in both children and adults. The progression from hepatocyte apoptosis to liver inflammation, fibrosis and cirrhosis, and liver failure is still not fully understood, but in older patients, liver disease can surpass lung disease as the principal cause of death. Liver function tests (LFTs) can measure plasma levels of liver enzymes to assess liver function but require careful interpretation. Non-invasive tests are being developed that can detect early liver disease, but liver biopsy is still the gold standard for assessing liver fibrosis once abnormal LFTs have been detected in a patient. Currently, there is no licensed treatment for AATD-related liver disease (intravenous AAT therapy is not indicated for this purpose), but liver transplantation is associated with positive outcomes and may even slow emphysema progression. Therefore, new strategies are being developed to address treatment of AATD-related liver disease, such as accelerating degradation of mutant AAT and assisting hepatocytes in the folding and secretion of mutant AAT, but these approaches remain at early stages of development."

The purpose of this study was to determine the test-retest reproducibility of AAT serum levels and to determine if between-measurements variability was associated with acute phase markers of inflammation. We retrospectively analyzed a sample of 255 patients from a community respirology practice with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in whom AAT serum levels were measured twice, on separate visits. White blood cell count and fibrinogen were also measured at the time of the second blood sampling as markers of acute phase inflammation. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), Pearson correlation coefficient, and Bland-Altman analysis were used to document test-retest reproducibility. Regression analyses were used to identify potential correlates of test-retest AAT level differences. Although the 2 AAT serum levels were significantly correlated, the between-measurement agreement was weak (ICC of 0.38 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.27 to 0.48]; Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.34 [95% CI, 0.23 to 0.44]) and Bland-Altman analysis revealed wide 95% limits of agreement. Considering that an AAT serum level below 1.13g/L should trigger further investigations to confirm the AAT status, discrepancies between the test-retest AAT levels resulted in reconsidering requirement for further investigation in 22% of patients. A significant correlation between the fibrinogen value and the second AAT level was found (<i>r</i>=0.21, <i>p</i>=0.004 [<i>n</i>=173]).

    "abstract": "Pathological mutations in Alpha-1 Antitrypsin (AAT) protein cause retention of toxic polymers in the hepatocyte endoplasmic reticulum. The risk for cirrhosis in AAT deficiency is likely directly related to retention of these polymers within the liver. Polymers are classically identified on liver biopsy as inclusion bodies by periodic acid schiff staining after diastase treatment and immunohistochemistry. However, characterization of the polymer burden within a biopsy sample is limited to a semi-quantitative scale as described by a pathologist. Better methods to quantify polymer are needed to advance our understanding of pathogenesis of disease. Therefore, we developed a method to quantify polymer aggregation from standard histologic specimens. In addition, we sought to understand the relationship of polymer burden and other histologic findings to the presence of liver fibrosis. Liver samples from a well-categorized AATD cohort were used to develop histo-morphometric tools to measure protein aggregation. Whole-slide morphometry reliably quantifies aggregates in AATD individuals. Despite very low levels of inclusions present (0-0.41%), accumulation of globules is not linear and is associated with higher fibrosis stages. Immunohistochemistry demonstrates that fibrosis is associated with polymer accumulation and not total AAT. A proportion of patients were found to be \"heavy accumulators\" with a polymer burden above the upper 25% of normal distribution. Males had significantly more liver inclusions and polymer than females. These measurements also highlight interrelated phenotypes of hepatocellular degeneration and autophagy in AATD liver disease. Quantitative inclusion analysis measures AAT accumulation in liver biopsy specimens. Quantification of polymer may identify individuals at risk for progressive disease and candidates for therapeutic interventions. Furthermore, these methods may be useful for evaluating efficacy of drugs targeting accumulation of AAT."

In five patients who received AAT for the first time, AαVal541 levels decreased to 20.6 nM (IQR 5.8-88.9 nM), and in five patients who already had received multiple infusions before, it decreased to 26.2 nM (IQR 22.31-35.0 nM). In 9 of 10 patients, AαVal541 levels were reduced to the median level of healthy controls (21.4 nM; IQR 16.7-30.1 nM). At 7-14 days after treatment, AαVal541 levels started to increase again in all patients. Our results show that fibrinopeptide AαVal541 may serve as a biochemical footprint to assess the efficacy of in vivo inhibition of PR3 activity in patients receiving intravenous AAT augmentation therapy."

    "abstract": "Cryptogenic elevation of transaminases in childhood can in a few instances be linked to rare hereditary causes. In this paper, a 7-year old girl is reported who was diagnosed with elevated transaminases of unknown origin since infancy. A liver biopsy showed bridging fibrosis, pale eosinophilic intracytoplasmic hepatocellular inclusions and enlarged endoplasmic reticulum cisternae in the hepatocytes. Whole-exome sequencing revealed a homozygous in-frame deletion of 3 base pairs in the haptoglobin gene. The patient is anhaptoglobinemic measured by standard laboratory turbidometry, which was confirmed by Western Blotting and thereby shown to affect both protein chains of haptoglobin. A polyclonal antibody revealed haptoglobin retention in hepatocytes suggesting a defect in haptoglobin secretion. A novel, previously unknown haptoglobin storage disease is suspected to be the reason for the elevated liver enzymes and tissue abnormalities in this patient. The pathophysiology appears to be similar to endoplasmic reticulum storage diseases like alpha-1-antitrypsin-deficiency."

    "abstract": "Lung Emphysema is an abnormal enlargement of the air sacs followed by the destruction of alveolar walls without any prominent fibrosis. This study primarily identifies the differentially expressed genes (DEGs), interactions between them, and their significant involvement in the activated signaling cascades. The dataset with ID GSE1122 (five normal lung tissue samples, five of usual emphysema, and five of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency-related emphysema) from the gene expression omnibus (GEO) was analyzed using the GEO2R tool. The physical association between the DEGs were mapped using the STRING tool and was visualized in the Cytoscape software. The enriched functional processes were identified with the ClueGO plugin's help from Cytoscape. Further integrative functional annotation was performed by implying the GeneGo Metacore™ to distinguish the enriched pathway maps, process networks, and GO processes. The results from this analysis revealed the critical signaling cascades that have been either activated or inhibited due to identified DEGs. We found the activated pathways such as immune response IL-1 signaling pathway, positive regulation of smooth muscle migration, BMP signaling pathway, positive regulation of leukocyte migration, NIK/NF-kappB signaling, and cytochrome-c oxidase activity. Finally, we mapped four crucial genes (CCL5, ALK, TAC1, CD74, and HLA-DOA) by comparing the functional annotations that could be significantly influential in emphysema molecular pathogenesis. Our study provides insights into the pathogenesis of emphysema and helps in developing potential drug targets against emphysema."

In well-selected AATD patients, therapy with plasma-derived AAT (pAAT), \"augmentation therapy\", provides modest clinical improvement but is perceived as cumbersome with weekly intravenous infusions. Using mouse models of emphysema, we compared the effects of a recombinant AAT-IgG1 Fc-fusion protein (AAT-Fc), which is expected to have a longer half-life following infusion, to those of pAAT. In an elastase model of emphysema, mice received a single intratracheal instillation of porcine pancreatic elastase (PPE) or human leucocyte elastase (hLE). AAT-Fc, pAAT, or vehicle was administered intraperitoneally 1 day prior to or 3 weeks following elastase instillation. Lung function and histology assessments were performed at 7 and 32 days after elastase instillation. In a cigarette smoke (CS) model of emphysema, mice were exposed to CS daily, 5 days a week, for 6 months and AAT-Fc, pAAT, or vehicle were administered every 10 days during the last 3 months of CS exposure. Assessments were performed 3 days after the last CS exposure. Immune responses to lung elastin peptide (EP) and the effects of AAT-Fc or pAAT treatment on dendritic cell (DC) function were determined ex vivo. Both elastase instillation and CS exposure triggered emphysema-like alveolar enlargement, increased lung compliance, and increased markers of inflammation compared to controls. Administration of AAT-Fc either prior to or following elastase instillation or during CS exposure provided greater protection than pAAT against alveolar enlargement, lung dysfunction, and airway inflammation. When challenged ex vivo with EP, spleen mononuclear cells from elastase-exposed mice exhibited dose-dependent production of IFNγ and IL-17, suggesting immune reactivity. In co-culture experiments with splenic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells isolated from elastase-exposed mice, AAT-Fc treatment prior to EP-priming of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells inhibited the production of IFNγ and IL-17. Compared to pAAT, AAT-Fc more effectively prevented or attenuated elastase- and CS-induced models of emphysema. These effects were associated with immunomodulatory effects on DC activity. AAT-Fc may provide a therapeutic option to individuals with AATD- and CS-induced emphysema."

    "abstract": "Matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13) is a uniquely important collagenase that promotes the irreversible destruction of cartilage collagen in osteoarthritis (OA). Collagenase activation is a key control point for cartilage breakdown to occur, yet our understanding of the proteinases involved in this process is limited. Neutrophil elastase (NE) is a well-described proteoglycan-degrading enzyme which is historically associated with inflammatory arthritis, but more recent evidence suggests a potential role in OA. In this study, we investigated the effect of neutrophil elastase on OA cartilage collagen destruction and collagenase activation. Neutrophil elastase induced significant collagen destruction from human OA cartilage ex vivo, in an MMP-dependent manner. In vitro, neutrophil elastase directly and robustly activated pro-MMP-13, and N-terminal sequencing identified cleavage close to the cysteine switch at <sup>72</sup> MKKPR, ultimately resulting in the fully active form with the neo-N terminus of <sup>85</sup> YNVFP. Mole-per-mole, activation was more potent than by MMP-3, a classical collagenase activator. Elastase was detectable in human OA synovial fluid and OA synovia which displayed histologically graded evidence of synovitis. Bioinformatic analyses demonstrated that, compared with other tissues, control cartilage exhibited remarkably high transcript levels of the major elastase inhibitor, (AAT) alpha-1 antitrypsin (gene name SERPINA1), but these were reduced in OA. AAT was located predominantly in superficial cartilage zones, and staining enhanced in regions of cartilage damage. Finally, active MMP-13 specifically inactivated AAT by removal of the serine proteinase cleavage/inhibition site. Taken together, this study identifies elastase as a novel activator of pro-MMP-13 that has relevance for cartilage collagen destruction in OA patients with synovitis."

AAT is synthesised mainly in the liver and is released into bloodstream to protect tissues (particularly lung) with its antiprotease activity. The homozygous Pi∗Z mutation (Pi∗ZZ genotype) is the predominant cause of severe AATD. It interferes with AAT secretion thereby leading to AAT accumulation in the liver and lack of AAT in the circulation and the lung. Accordingly, Pi∗ZZ individuals are strongly predisposed to lung and liver injury. The former is treated by a weekly AAT augmentation therapy, but not medicinal products exist for the liver. Our review summarises the current approaches silencing AAT production, improving protein folding and secretion or promoting AAT degradation."

This cell therapy prevented both structural and functional changes of emphysematous lung disease. A mixture of endothelial cells and cardiomyocytes was injected into infarcted mouse hearts, and both cell types orthotopically engrafted in the ischemic areas.

We demonstrate that correction of the Z mutation in patient iPSCs reduces aberrant AAT accumulation and increases its secretion. Adenine base editing (ABE) of differentiated iHeps decreases ER stress in edited cells, as demonstrated by single-cell RNA sequencing. We find ABE to be highly efficient in iPSCs and do not identify off-target genomic mutations by whole-genome sequencing.

Protease-antiprotease balance is crucial in bronchiectasis pathophysiology and increased presence of unopposed proteases activity may contribute to bronchiectasis onset and progression. Proteases' over-reactivity and antiprotease deficiency may have a role in increasing inflammation in bronchiectasis airways and may lead to extracellular matrix degradation and tissue damage. Imbalances in serine proteases and matrix-metallo proteinases (MMPs) have been associated to bronchiectasis. Active neutrophil elastase has been associated with disease severity and poor long-term outcomes in this disease. Moreover, high levels of MMPs have been associated with radiological and disease severity. Finally, severe deficiency of α1-antitrypsin (AAT), as PiSZ and PiZZ (proteinase inhibitor SZ and ZZ) phenotype, have been associated with bronchiectasis development. Several treatments are under study to reduce protease activity in lungs. Molecules to inhibit neutrophil elastase activity have been developed in both oral or inhaled form, along with compounds inhibiting dipeptydil-peptidase 1, enzyme responsible for the activation of serine proteases. Finally, supplementation with AAT is in use for patients with severe deficiency. The identification of different targets of therapy within the protease-antiprotease balance contributes to a precision medicine approach in bronchiectasis and eventually interrupts and disrupts the vicious vortex which characterizes the disease."

    "abstract": "In this article, we review the biological and clinical implication of the Recruitment-Secretory Block (\"R-SB\") phenomenon. The phenomenon refers to the reaction of the liver with regard to protein secretion in conditions of clinical stimulation. Our basic knowledge of the process is due to the experimental work in animal models. Under basal conditions, the protein synthesis is mainly carried out by periportal (zone 1) hepatocytes that are considered the \"professional\" synthesizing protein cells. Under stimulation, midlobular and centrolobular (zones 2 and 3) hepatocytes, are progressively recruited according to lobular gradients and contribute to the increase of synthesis and secretion. The block of secretion, operated by exogenous agents, causes intracellular retention of all secretory proteins. The Pi MZ phenotype of Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) has turned out to be the key for in vivo studies of the reaction of the liver, as synthesis and block of secretion are concomitant. Indeed, the M fraction of AAT is stimulated for synthesis and regularly exported while the Z fraction is mostly retained within the cell. For that reason, the phenomenon has been designated \"Recruitment-Secretory Block\" (\"R-SB\"). The \"R-SB\" phenomenon explains why: (a) the MZ individuals can correct the serum deficiency; (b) the resulting immonohistochemical and electron microscopic (EM) patterns are very peculiar and specific for the diagnosis of the Z mutation in tissue sections in the absence of genotyping; (c) the term carrier is no longer applicable for the heterozygous condition as all Pi MZ individuals undergo storage and the storage predisposes to liver damage. The storage represents the true elementary lesion and consequently reflects the phenotype-genotype correlation; (d) the site and function of the extrahepatic AAT and the relationship between intra and extracellular AAT; (e) last but not least, the concept of Endoplasmic Reticulum Storage Disease (ERSD) and of a new disease, hereditary hypofibrinogenemia with hepatic storage (HHHS). In the light of the emerging phenomenon, described in vitro, namely that M and Z AAT can form heteropolymers within hepatocytes as well as in circulation, we have reviewed the whole clinical and experimental material collected during forty years, in order to evaluate to what extent the polymerization phenomenon occurs in vivo. The paper summarizes similarities and differences between AAT and Fibrinogen as well as between the related diseases, AATD and HHHS. Indeed, fibrinogen gamma chain mutations undergo an aggregation process within the RER of hepatocytes similar to AATD. In addition, this work has clarified the intriguing phenomenon underlying a new syndrome, hereditary hypofibrinogenemia and hypo-APO-B-lipoproteinemia with hepatic storage of fibrinogen and APO-B lipoproteins. It is hoped that these studies could contribute to future research and select strategies aimed to simultaneously correct the hepatocytic storage, thus preventing the liver damage and the plasma deficiency of the two proteins."

Patients with AATD (n=51; mean AAT level, 20.3 mg/dL [to convert to μmol/L, multiply by 0.184]) were approximately 10 years younger than those in the control group (n=93; mean AAT level, 172.0 mg/dL), with a mean age of 55 vs 65 years.

    "abstract": "Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is the only readily identifiable monogenic cause of COPD. To date the only condition-specific treatment for AATD-associated COPD is weekly administration of intravenous plasma-purified human alpha-1 antitrypsin (IV-AAT). Uncertainties regarding which AATD genotypes should benefit from IV-AAT persist. IV-AAT is costly and involves weekly administration of a plasma product. Much of the risk stratification has been centred around the long-accepted hypothesis of a \"putative protective threshold\" of 11 µM (0.57 g·L<sup>-1</sup>) AAT in serum. This hypothesis has become central to the paradigm of AATD care, although its derivation and accuracy for defining risk of disease remain unclear.We reviewed the literature and examined the association between the 11 µM threshold and clinical outcomes to provide context and insight into the issues surrounding this topic.We found no data demonstrating an increased risk of COPD dependent on the 11 µM threshold. Moreover, an abundance of recent clinical data examining this threshold refutes the hypothesis. Conversely, the use of 11 µM as a treatment target in appropriate ZZ individuals is supported by clinical evidence, although more refined dosing regimens are being explored.Continued use of the 11 µM threshold as a determinant of clinical risk is questionable, perpetuates inappropriate AAT-augmentation practices, may drive increased healthcare expenditure and should not be used as an indicator for commencing treatment.Genotype represents a more proven indicator of risk, with ZZ and rare ZZ-equivalent genotypes independently associated with COPD. New and better risk assessment models are needed to provide individuals diagnosed with AATD with reliable risk estimation and optimised treatment goals."

The objective of this study was to analyze the distribution of Mmalton mutations in a Canarian population previously studied for the most common deficient alleles, namely PI*S (S) and PI*Z (Z), with PI*M (M) being the normal variant. A cross-sectional study of 648 patients with allergic asthma was carried out. Mmalton mutation of the <i>SERPINA1</i> gene was assayed by real-time PCR. Of the 648 patients, 3 (0.46%) were carriers of a Mmalton allele. All of them had low levels of AAT (53.9 mg/dL, 90 mg/dL, and 61 mg/dL, respectively) and were asymptomatic, showing normal lung function, radiological images, and levels of hepatic transaminases. In conclusion, although the most frequent AATD genotypes are Z and S alleles, it is important to consider other rare variants, particularly when low AAT serum levels are observed. Although individuals with the Mmalton mutation usually have a heterogenous clinical presentation and very low levels of AAT, all the patients in this study were asymptomatic."

    "abstract": "A single point mutation in the Z-variant of alpha 1-antitrypsin (Z-AAT) alone can lead to both a protein folding and trafficking defect, preventing its exit from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and the formation of aggregates that are retained as inclusions within the ER of hepatocytes. These defects result in a systemic AAT deficiency (AATD) that causes lung disease, whereas the ER-retained aggregates can induce severe liver injury in patients with ZZ-AATD. Unfortunately, therapeutic approaches are still limited and <i>liver transplantation</i> represents the <i>only curative treatment</i> option<i>.</i> To overcome this limitation, a better understanding of the molecular basis of ER aggregate formation could provide new strategies for therapeutic intervention. Our functional and omics approaches here based on human hepatocytes from patients with ZZ-AATD have enabled the identification and characterisation of the role of the protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) A4/ERP72 in features of AATD-mediated liver disease. We report that 4 members of the PDI family (PDIA4, PDIA3, P4HB, and TXNDC5) are specifically upregulated in ZZ-AATD liver samples from adult patients. Furthermore, we show that only PDIA4 knockdown or alteration of its activity by cysteamine treatment can promote Z-AAT secretion and lead to a marked decrease in Z aggregates. Finally, detailed analysis of the Z-AAT interactome shows that PDIA4 silencing provides a more conducive environment for folding of the Z mutant, accompanied by reduction of Z-AAT-mediated oxidative stress, a feature of AATD-mediated liver disease. PDIA4 is involved in AATD-mediated liver disease and thus represents a therapeutic target for inhibition by drugs such as cysteamine. PDI inhibition therefore represents a potential therapeutic approach for treatment of AATD. Protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) family members, and particularly PDIA4, are upregulated and involved in alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency (AATD)-mediated liver disease in adults. PDI inhibition upon cysteamine treatment leads to improvements in features of AATD and hence represents a therapeutic approach for treatment of AATD-mediated liver disease."

    "abstract": "Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is an autosomal co-dominant disease known for different genetic alterations in the serine protease inhibitor enzyme by which different disease phenotypes can manifest. The lung and the liver are the most common organs involved. The severity of the disease depends on the phenotypes involved. However, emerging evidence shows that this disease can impact multiple organ systems and may even develop regardless of the phenotype. We describe a case of a young man with a known history of the MS phenotype who presented with chest pain and was found to have pulmonary emboli and bullae. His past medical history was relevant for a gastric ulcer and elevated liver enzymes. Due to this young man's age and lack of risk factors for the aforementioned diseases, we propose that these findings were manifestations of his MS phenotype. This case raises multiple questions challenging the presumed benign nature of the MS phenotype. We propose a closer follow-up and lower threshold for diagnostic studies in patients with the heterozygous form."

    "abstract": "Sarcoidosis is a multisystem granulomatous disease of unknown origin with a variable and often unpredictable course and pattern of organ involvement. In this study we sought to identify specific bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cell gene expression patterns indicative of distinct disease phenotypic traits. RNA sequencing by Ion Torrent Proton was performed on BAL cells obtained from 215 well-characterised patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis enrolled in the multicentre Genomic Research in Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency and Sarcoidosis (GRADS) study. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis and nonparametric statistics were used to analyse genome-wide BAL transcriptome. Validation of results was performed using a microarray expression dataset of an independent sarcoidosis cohort (Freiburg, Germany; n=50). Our supervised analysis found associations between distinct transcriptional programmes and major pulmonary phenotypic manifestations of sarcoidosis including T-helper type 1 (Th1) and Th17 pathways associated with hilar lymphadenopathy, transforming growth factor-β1 (TGFB1) and mechanistic target of rapamycin (MTOR) signalling with parenchymal involvement, and interleukin (IL)-7 and IL-2 with airway involvement. Our unsupervised analysis revealed gene modules that uncovered four potential sarcoidosis endotypes including hilar lymphadenopathy with increased acute T-cell immune response; extraocular organ involvement with PI3K activation pathways; chronic and multiorgan disease with increased immune response pathways; and multiorgan involvement, with increased IL-1 and IL-18 immune and inflammatory responses. We validated the occurrence of these endotypes using gene expression, pulmonary function tests and cell differentials from Freiburg. Taken together, our results identify BAL gene expression programmes that characterise major pulmonary sarcoidosis phenotypes and suggest the presence of distinct disease molecular endotypes."

    "abstract": "Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a rare genetic disorder caused by a mutation in the SERPINA1 gene, which encodes the protease inhibitor alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT). Severe AATD predisposes individuals to COPD and liver disease. Early diagnosis is essential for implementing preventive measures and limiting the disease burden. Although national and international guidelines for the diagnosis and management of AATD have been available for 20 years, more than 85% of cases go undiagnosed and therefore untreated. In Brazil, reasons for the underdiagnosis of AATD include a lack of awareness of the condition among physicians, a racially diverse population, serum AAT levels being assessed in a limited number of individuals, and lack of convenient diagnostic tools. The diagnosis of AATD is based on laboratory test results. The standard diagnostic approach involves the assessment of serum AAT levels, followed by phenotyping, genotyping, gene sequencing, or combinations of those, to detect the specific mutation. Over the past 10 years, new techniques have been developed, offering a rapid, minimally invasive, reliable alternative to traditional testing methods. One such test available in Brazil is the A1AT Genotyping Test, which simultaneously analyzes the 14 most prevalent AATD mutations, using DNA extracted from a buccal swab or dried blood spot. Such advances may contribute to overcoming the problem of underdiagnosis in Brazil and elsewhere, as well as being likely to increase the rate detection of AATD and therefore mitigate the harmful effects of delayed diagnosis."

    "abstract": "Alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency causes pulmonary disease due to decreased levels of circulating AAT and consequently unbalanced protease activity in the lungs. Deposition of specific AAT variants, such as the common Z AAT, within hepatocytes may also result in liver disease. These deposits are comprised of ordered polymers of AAT formed by an inter-molecular domain swap. The discovery and characterization of rare variants of AAT and other serpins have historically played a crucial role in the dissection of the structural mechanisms leading to AAT polymer formation. Here, we report a severely deficient shutter region variant, Bologna AAT (N186Y), which was identified in five unrelated subjects with different geographical origins. We characterized the new variant by expression in cellular models in comparison with known polymerogenic AAT variants. Bologna AAT showed secretion deficiency and intracellular accumulation as detergent-insoluble polymers. Extracellular polymers were detected in both the culture media of cells expressing Bologna AAT and in the plasma of a patient homozygous for this variant. Structural modelling revealed that the mutation disrupts the hydrogen bonding network in the AAT shutter region. These data support a crucial coordinating role for asparagine 186 and the importance of this network in promoting formation of the native structure."

AAT mutations interfere with the AAT production/secretion, cause decreased AAT serum levels and accumulation of AAT in the liver. The excess AAT leads to a proteotoxic liver disease, while the lack of AAT in systemic circulation predisposes to lung injury. While AATD related lung disease is well understood, liver disease needs further awareness. Non-invasive liver stiffness measurement constitutes a useful method to estimate the extent of liver fibrosis. Significant liver fibrosis occurs in 20-35 % of individuals with the classic, severe genotype Pi*ZZ. Genotype Pi*SZ, also known as the compound heterozygous form, confers an increased risk of both liver fibrosis and liver neoplasia. Even the heterozygous genotype Pi*MZ increases the odds of fibrosis in presence of further risk factors such as obesity, male sex, metabolic syndrome and diabetes mellitus. In individuals with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease or alcohol misuse it promotes the development of liver cirrhosis. While no drug treatment exists for AATD-related liver disease, there are several compounds in clinical phase II/III-trials. These either silence the AAT production via siRNA or facilitate the secretion of AAT from the liver due to an improved folding."

Reasons for these disparities likely include challenges to delivery of care that have not been explored. To determine challenges faced by rural primary care providers when caring for COPD patients. Rural primary care providers in 7 primarily western states were asked about barriers they experienced when caring for COPD patients. A total of 71 rural primary care medical providers completed the survey, of which 51% were physicians and 49% were advanced practice providers (APPs). A total of 61% used Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease or American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society guidelines as an assessment and treatment resource. The presence of multiple chronic conditions and patient failure to recognize and report symptoms were the greatest barriers to diagnose COPD. A total of 89% of providers used spirometry to diagnose COPD, but only 62% were satisfied with access to spirometry. Despite recommendations, 41% of providers never test for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. A total of 87% were comfortable with their ability to assess symptoms, but only 11% used a guideline-recommended assessment tool. Although most providers were satisfied with their ability to treat symptoms and exacerbations, only 66% were content with their ability to prevent exacerbations. Fewer providers were happy with their access to pulmonologists (55%) or pulmonary rehabilitation (37%). Subgroup analyses revealed differences based on provider type (APP versus physician) and location (Colorado and Kansas versus other states), but not on population or practice size. Rural providers face significant challenges when caring for COPD patients that should be targeted in future interventions to improve COPD outcomes."

    "abstract": "Alpha 1-antitrypsin is one of the first protein therapeutics introduced on the market more than 30 years ago, and to date, it is indicated only for the treatment of the severe forms of a genetic condition known as alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. The only approved preparations are derived from plasma, posing potential problems associated with its limited supply and high processing costs. Moreover, augmentation therapy with alpha-1 antitrypsin is still limited to intravenous infusions, a cumbersome regimen for patients. Here, we review the recent literature on its possible future developments, focusing on i) the recombinant alternatives to the plasma-derived protein, ii) novel formulations, and iii) novel administration routes. Regulatory issues and the still unclear noncanonical functions of alpha-1 antitrypsin, possibly associated with the glycosylation pattern found only in the plasma-derived protein, have hindered the introduction of new products. However, potentially new therapeutic indications other than the treatment of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency might open the way to new sources and new formulations."

However, AATD-associated HRU and healthcare costs have not been extensively described. This study describes and compares real-world HRU and healthcare costs among US patients with severe (requiring hospitalization after AATD-related PE) versus nonsevere AATD clinical course. Administrative healthcare claims for patients with a second primary AATD diagnosis between 6/1/2008 and 12/31/2017 were analyzed from 2 databases (requiring continuous enrollment 6 months preceding diagnosis). Patient baseline characteristics and AATD-associated PE incidence rates, HRU, and healthcare costs during follow-up were compared in patients with severe versus nonsevere AATD. Of 5109 patients with a second AATD diagnosis, 2674 (severe, <i>n</i> = 711 [26.6%]; nonsevere, <i>n</i> = 1963 [73.4%]) had ≥1 AATD-associated PE. PE incidence per 100 person-years was higher in patients with severe versus nonsevere AATD. Annual incidences (mean ± SD) of emergency department (1.2 ± 5.7 vs. 0.4 ± 1.2), inpatient (1.3 ± 2.5 vs. 0.1 ± 0.5), and outpatient (10.3 ± 15.9 vs. 5.7 ± 13.2) visits were higher in patients with severe versus nonsevere AATD. Median (interquartile range) annual costs were also higher for patients with severe versus nonsevere AATD for emergency department ($185 [$0-$1665] vs. $0 [$0-$264]), inpatient ($16,038 [$2968-$70,941] vs. $0 [$0-$0]), and outpatient ($2663 [$412-$10,277] vs. $1114 [$134-$4195]) visits. Higher percentages of patients with severe AATD were prescribed augmentation therapy, antibiotics, or corticosteroids. These findings suggest that patients with severe AATD have higher incidence of AATD-associated PEs, as well as higher HRU and healthcare costs."

Congenital cytomegalovirus (cCMV) infection may initially involve the liver, yet in otherwise healthy hosts rarely leads to long-term hepatic disease. We report a series of three patients, diagnosed with hereditary liver diseases: progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC) type IV, alpha 1 anti-trypsin deficiency (A1ATD) and Alagille syndrome (ALGS), who were also diagnosed with cCMV infection. All patients were treated with valgancilovir for symptomatic cCMV infection (6-12 months), followed by suppressive dosing in the 2 patients with PFIC and A1ATD. Following 15-24 months of follow-up - the patients with PFIC and A1ATD developed severe liver failure, and the third had ongoing cholestatic disease with stable synthetic function. We propose a significant contribution of cCMV infection to the course of the inherited primary disease, possibly leading to further compromise of the liver. We recommend screening patients with inherited liver disease for cCMV, and considering anti-viral treatment with valganciclovir to delay hepatic disease progression."

The cell transplantation technique poses an alternative way of combating liver failure. Hepatic specific differentiation of the human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) was initiated with 100 ng/mL activin A, followed by 20 ng/mL of BMP-4 and 10 ng/mL of FGF-2. The cells were transplanted into the livers of AATD transgenic mice using intra-splenic injections. FK506 was used as an immunosuppressor. At 1, 3, and 6 months post-transplantation, the human serum albumin (HSA) levels and its DNA contents, and the mice serum and liver tissues were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), polymerase chain reactions (PCR), and immunohistochemistry to estimate the repopulation of the hepatic-specified cells. Post transplantation, the hepatic-specified cells were found to be successfully and progressively repopulated in the transgenic mice livers. Additionally, the hepatic-specified cells did not display any carcinogenicity, as confirmed by the absence of any tumors on the animals. We provide a time saving and low cost method of transplanting hepatic-specified cells into the livers of AATD mice without any risk of carcinogenicity, a method that may be a potential option for the treatment of AATD."

This communication raises the hypothesis that the severity of COVID-19, a complex disease where the individual response to the infection may play a significant role, could partly result from a gene-environment interaction between air-pollution and Alpha-1 Antitrypsin (AAT) genes. To evaluate the impact of the AAT and air pollution interaction on COVID-19, we introduced an AAT*air pollution global risk score summing together, in each country, an air pollution score (ozone, nitrogen dioxide and fine particulate matter) and an AAT score (which sums the ranked frequency of MZ, SZ, MS). We compared this global score with the ranking of European countries in terms of death number per million persons. The ranking of the AAT*air pollution global risk score matched the ranking of the countries in terms of the observed COVID-19 deaths per 1M inhabitants, namely in the case of the first European countries: Belgium, UK, Spain, Italy, Sweden, France. We observed parallelism between the number of COVID deaths and the AAT*air pollution global risk in Europe. AAT anti-protease, immune-modulating and coagulation-modulating activities may explain this finding, although very speculatively. Even if further studies taking into account genetic background, population density, temporal dynamics of individual epidemics, access to healthcare, social disparities and immunological response to SARS-CoV2 are needed, our preliminary observation urges to open a discussion on gene-environment interactions in COVID-19."

The factors implicated in the regulation of CX3CR1 and its specific ligand CX3CL1 (fractalkine) expression remain largely unknown. Recent studies provide evidence that host's misfolded proteins occurring in the forms of polymers or amyloid fibrils can regulate CX3CR1 expression. Herein, a novel example demonstrates that polymers of human ZZ alpha-1 antitrypsin (Z-AAT) protein, resulting from its conformational misfolding due to the Z (Glu342Lys) mutation in <i>SERPINA1</i> gene, strongly lower CX3CR1 mRNA expression in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). This parallels with increase of intracellular levels of CX3CR1 and Z-AAT proteins. Presented data indicate the involvement of the CX3CR1 pathway in the Z-AAT-related disorders and further support the role of misfolded proteins in CX3CR1 regulation."

Z allele heterozygosity was strongly associated with increased height (β=1.02 cm, p=3.91×10<sup>-68</sup>), and with other nonrespiratory phenotypes including increased risk of gall bladder disease, reduced risk of heart disease and lower blood pressure, reduced risk of osteoarthritis and reduced bone mineral density, increased risk of headache and enlarged prostate, as well as with blood biomarkers of liver function.

Furthermore, we show for the first time that sex modifies the association of the Z allele on lung function. We conclude that Z allele heterozygosity and homozygosity exhibit opposing effects on lung function in the UK population, and that these associations are modified by smoking and sex.

Comorbidities such as COPD, diabetes, hypertension and malignancy predispose patients with Covid-19 to adverse clinical outcomes. Alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a genetic disorder caused by pathological mutation(s) in the SERPINA1 gene resulting in an imbalance in proteinase activity which may lead to premature emphysema and COPD. Our aim was to investigate whether people with severe AAT deficiency (AATD) have an increased risk of (severe) COVID-19 infection. We collected data on COVID-19 symptoms, laboratory-confirmed infection, hospitalization and treatment by means of a telephone survey, directly administered to Italian severe AATD subjects in May 2020. We then compared our findings with data collected by the Istituto Superiore di Sanità on the total population in Italy during the same period. We found an higher frequency of SARS-CoV-2 infection in our cohort (3.8%) compared to national data regarding infection, thus giving severe AATD a relative risk of 8. 8 (95%CI 5.1-20,0; p<0.0001) for symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, the relative risk (RR) was higher in AATD patients with pre-existing lung diseases (RR 13.9; 95%CI 8.0-33.6; p<0.001), but with a similar death rate (1 in 8, 12.5%) compared to the general population (13.9%; RR 0.9). These preliminary findings highlight the importance of close surveillance in the spread of COVID-19 in patients with severe AATD and underlines the need for further studies into the role of the antiprotease shield in preventing SARS-Cov-2 infection."

The number of A1AT deficiency variant genotype (ZZ, SZ, MZ, SS, and MS) diagnoses were reviewed for BC and AB. The regional diagnostic rates for A1AT deficiency variants in these two provinces, normalized for the predicted population prevalence of each variant genotype, was defined as the annual provincial diagnostic rate (APDR) for a given variant genotype. Sex specific variations in the mean age at diagnosis for the five variant genotypes were compared both within and between provinces. The SZ and MZ genotype APDRs were significantly increased in the AB population compared to the BC population. The SS and MS APDRs were similar between AB and BC. There was a significantly decreased mean age of diagnosis for AB males, as compared to BC males (for the SZ, MS, and MZ genotypes) and as compared to AB females (for the MS, MZ, and SS genotypes). There were no significant differences in the mean age of diagnosis between the females and males in BC, or between females in AB and BC, for any genotype. The notably higher APDR for more severe A1AT deficiency genotypes, and lower mean age of diagnosis for most variant genotypes in AB males, deserves further investigation to determine the explanation(s) for these differences."

For the milder variant, PI*S, it was 0.5818 and 0.6326, respectively. In Japan, the number of patients and deaths correlated with the population size with a CC of 0.6667 and 0.7074 respectively, and was proportional to the population size to the power of 1.65 and 1.54. The prevalence of AAT deficiency also correlated with the epidemiological pattern of COVID-19. In countries with high prevalence of AAT deficiency, after the initial rise, the daily number of patients and that of deaths ran parallel at a high level for more than 6 months without sign of abatement. In countries with a low prevalence of AAT deficiency, after the first wave of the epidemic, the number of the deaths decreased continuously while the number of patients remained the same or even increased resulting in a decreasing case-fatality rate. When the cumulative number of deaths was plotted on the y-axis against the cumulative number of patients on the x-axis, plots fell on a straight line in countries with a high prevalence of AAT deficiency; while in countries with a low prevalence of AAT deficiency, a break appeared, after which the plots fell on flatter slope indicating decreasing case-fatality rate. The observation suggests emergence of an attenuated variant in countries with a low prevalence of AAT deficiency."

A seven-question sleep apnea risk assessment questionnaire, STOP-BAG, was applied to 2338 participant responses from the Alpha-1 Coded Testing Study (ACT) and 4638 participant responses from the Kentucky Behavioral Risk Factor Survey (KyBRFS). Propensity scores were generated from a logistic regression model using continuous variables of age and body mass index (BMI). STOP-BAG scores were analyzed using chi-square analysis on this matched cohort to assess OSA risk in AATD. Self-reported OSA was higher in the KyBRFS cohort (14.5%) than in individuals with mild or severe AATD (11.2%) (p = 0.012). However, a higher percentage of the AATD cohort met clinically meaningful thresholds for STOP-BAG scores ≥ 5 (22.7%) than the KyBRFS cohort (13.0%) (p = 0.001). These differences persisted despite 1:1 propensity score matching on age and BMI to account for differences in baseline characteristics. No statistically significant difference in OSA risk between AATD genotypes was found. AATD appears to have higher risk for OSA than the general population. The 11.2% prevalence of diagnosed OSA in the AATD population is much lower than symptom scores would predict. Further studies are needed to validate the possibility that elastin loss is involved in OSA pathogenesis."

    "abstract": "Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) has established anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease but there is increasing evidence of its role in other inflammatory and immune-mediated conditions, like diabetes mellitus (DM). AAT activity is altered in both developing and established type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) as well in established type 2 DM (T2DM). Augmentation therapy with AAT appears to favorably impact T1DM development in mice models and to affect β-cell function and inflammation in humans with T1DM. The role of AAT in T2DM is less clear, but AAT activity appears to be reduced in T2DM. This article reviews these associations and emerging therapeutic strategies using AAT to treat DM."

    "title": "Utility of Transient Elastography for the Screening of Liver Disease in Patients with Alpha1-Antitrypsin Deficiency.",
    "abstract": "Screening of liver disease in alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is usually carried out with liver enzymes, with low sensitivity. We conducted a multicenter cross-sectional study aiming to describe the utility of transient elastography for the identification of liver disease in patients with AATD. A total of 148 AATD patients were included. Among these, 54.7% were Pi*ZZ and 45.3% were heterozygous for the Z allele. Between 4.9% and 16.5% of patients had abnormal liver enzymes, without differences among genotypes. Liver stiffness measurement (LSM) was significantly higher in Pi*ZZ individuals than in heterozygous Z (5.6 vs. 4.6 kPa; <i>p</i> = 0.001). In total, in 8 (5%) individuals LSM was >7.5 kPa, considered significant liver fibrosis, and ≥10 kPa in 3 (1.9%) all being Pi*ZZ. Elevated liver enzymes were more frequently observed in patients with LSM > 7.5 kPa, but in 5 out of 8 of these patients all liver enzymes were within normal range. In patients with AATD, the presence of abnormal liver enzymes is frequent; however, most of these patients do not present significant liver fibrosis. Transient elastography can help to identify patients with liver fibrosis even with normal liver enzymes and should be performed in all Z-allele carriers to screen for liver disease."

    "title": "Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Screening in a Selected Cohort of Patients Affected by Chronic Pulmonary Diseases in Naples, Italy.",
    "abstract": "Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a genetic condition associated with several respiratory diseases in patients with severe protein deficiency. AATD is often late diagnosed or underdiagnosed. Diagnosis frequently occurs in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and emphysema characterized by frequent exacerbations and over ten years' duration. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the incidence of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency in patients with the chronic pulmonary disease after a thorough screening in the city of Naples in southern Italy. Two hundred patients suffering from respiratory pathology (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), emphysema, asthma, or bronchiectasis) were examined and evaluated in our outpatients' clinic and tested for serum levels of AAT. Patients who had a respiratory disease suspected of AATD and/or serum AAT < 120 mg/dL underwent genetic testing. Genetic screening was performed on samples from 141 patients. A total of 36 patients had an intermediate deficiency of AAT levels. Among them, 8 were PI*MZ, 6 were PI*MS and 22 had rare pathological mutations. Five patients had a severe AATD, all were composite heterozygous with S or Z allele, while the other allele had a rare pathological mutation. The incidence of genetic defects as AATD in the population of patients affected by chronic respiratory disorders is always a matter of discussion because of the frequent interaction between genes and environmental causes. In our series, numerous rare variants and compound heterozygosity have been described. No homozygous patients have been described. The present is one of few studies available on the incidence of rare variants in the geographic area of the city of Naples. So, our results could be considered interesting not only to know the incidence of AATD and its related rare mutations but also to support early diagnosis and treatments for patients with chronic pulmonary disease and frequent exacerbation and to fight the association with environmental causes of pulmonary damages as smoking."

    "abstract": "A previous 2-week clinical trial of aerosolized hyaluronan (HA) in COPD showed a rapid reduction in lung elastic fiber breakdown, as measured by sputum levels of the unique elastin crosslinks, desmosine and isodesmosine (DID). To further assess the therapeutic efficacy of HA and the utility of DID as surrogate markers for the development of pulmonary emphysema, we have conducted a 28-day randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial of HA involving 27 subjects with alpha-1 antiprotease deficiency COPD. The study drug consisted of a 3 ml inhalation solution containing 0.03% HA with an average molecular weight of 150 kDa that was self-administered twice daily. DID levels were measured in urine, sputum, and plasma using tandem mass spectrometry. Free urine DID in the HA group showed a significant negative correlation with time between days 14 and 35 (r = -1.0, p = 0.023) and was statistically significantly decreased from baseline at day 35 (15.4 vs 14.2 ng/mg creatinine, p = 0.035). A marked decrease in sputum DID was also seen in the HA group between days 1 and 28 (0.96 vs 0.18 ng/mg protein), but the difference was not significant, possibly due to the small number of adequate specimens. Plasma DID remained unchanged following HA treatment and no significant reductions in urine, sputum, or plasma DID were seen in the placebo group. The results support additional clinical trials to further evaluate the therapeutic effect of HA and the use of DID as a real-time marker of drug efficacy."

    "abstract": "The primary objective is to demonstrate that, in patients with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 resulting in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), administration of 120mg/kg of body weight of intravenous Prolastin®(plasma-purified alpha-1 antitrypsin) reduces circulating plasma levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6). Secondary objectives are to determine the effects of intravenous Prolastin® on important clinical outcomes including the incidence of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs). Phase 2, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, pilot trial. The study will be conducted in Intensive Care Units in hospitals across Ireland. Patients with a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2-infection, moderate to severe ARDS (meeting Berlin criteria for a diagnosis of ARDS with a PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> ratio <200 mmHg), >18 years of age and requiring invasive or non-invasive mechanical ventilation. All individuals meeting any of the following exclusion criteria at baseline or during screening will be excluded from study participation: more than 96 hours has elapsed from onset of ARDS; age < 18 years; known to be pregnant or breastfeeding; participation in a clinical trial of an investigational medicinal product (other than antibiotics or antivirals) within 30 days; major trauma in the prior 5 days; presence of any active malignancy (other than nonmelanoma skin cancer) which required treatment within the last year; WHO Class III or IV pulmonary hypertension; pulmonary embolism prior to hospital admission within past 3 months; currently receiving extracorporeal life support (ECLS); chronic kidney disease receiving dialysis; severe chronic liver disease with Child-Pugh score > 12; DNAR (Do Not Attempt Resuscitation) order in place; treatment withdrawal imminent within 24 hours; Prisoners; non-English speaking patients or those who do not adequately understand verbal or written information unless an interpreter is available; IgA deficiency. Intervention: Either a once weekly intravenous infusion of Prolastin® at 120mg/kg of body weight for 4 weeks or a single dose of Prolastin® at 120mg/kg of body weight intravenously followed by once weekly intravenous infusion of an equal volume of 0.9% sodium chloride for a further 3 weeks. Comparator (placebo): An equal volume of 0.9% sodium chloride intravenously once per week for four weeks. The primary effectiveness outcome measure is the change in plasma concentration of IL-6 at 7 days as measured by ELISA. Secondary outcomes include: safety and tolerability of Prolastin® in the respective groups (as defined by the number of SAEs and AEs); PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> ratio; respiratory compliance; sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score; mortality; time on ventilator in days; plasma concentration of alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) as measured by nephelometry; plasma concentrations of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-8 (IL-8), interleukin-10 (IL-10), soluble TNF receptor 1 (sTNFR1, a surrogate marker for TNF-α) as measured by ELISA; development of shock; acute kidney injury; need for renal replacement therapy; clinical relapse, as defined by the need for readmission to the ICU or a marked decline in PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> or development of shock or mortality following a period of sustained clinical improvement; secondary bacterial pneumonia as defined by the combination of radiographic findings and sputum/airway secretion microscopy and culture. Following informed consent/assent patients will be randomised. The randomisation lists will be prepared by the study statistician and given to the unblinded trial personnel. However, the statistician will not be exposed to how the planned treatment will be allocated to the treatment codes. Randomisation will be conducted in a 1:1:1 ratio, stratified by site and age. The investigator, treating physician, other members of the site research team and patients will be blinded to treatment allocation. The clinical trial pharmacy personnel and research nurses will be unblinded to facilitate intervention and placebo preparation. The unblinded individuals will keep the treatment information confidential. The infusion bag will be masked at the time of preparation and will be administered via a masked infusion set to maintain blinding. A total of 36 patients will be recruited and randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio to each of the trial arms. In March 2020, version 1.0 of the trial protocol was submitted to the local research ethics committee (REC), Health Research Consent Declaration Committee (HRCDC) and the Health Products regulatory Authority (HPRA). REC approval was granted on April 1<sup>st</sup> 2020, HPRA approval was granted on April 24<sup>th</sup> 2020 and the HRCDC provided a conditional declaration on April 17<sup>th</sup> 2020. In July 2020 a substantial amendment (version 2.0) was submitted to the REC, HRCDC and HPRA. Protocol changes in this amendment included: the addition of trial sites; extending the duration of the trial to 12 months from 3 months; removal of inclusion criteria requiring the need for vasopressors; amendment of randomisation schedule to stratify by age only and not BMI and sex; correction of grammatical error in relation to infusion duration; to allow for inclusion of subjects who may have been enrolled in a clinical trial involving either antibiotics or anti-virals in the past 30 days; to allow for inclusion of subjects who may be currently enrolled in a clinical trial involving either antibiotics or anti-virals; to remove the need for exclusion based on alpha-1 antitrypsin phenotype; removal of mandatory isoelectric focusing of plasma to confirm Pi*MM status at screening; removal of need for mandatory echocardiogram at screening; amendment on procedures around plasma analysis to reflect that this will be conducted at the central site laboratory (as trial is multi-site and no longer single site); wording amended to reflect that interim analysis of cytokine levels taken at 7 days may be conducted. HRCDC approved version 2.0 on September 14th 2020, and HPRA approved on October 22nd 2020. REC approved the substantial amendment on November 23<sup>rd</sup>. In November 2020, version 3.0 of the trial protocol was submitted to the REC and HPRA. The rationale for this amendment was to allow for patients with moderate to severe ARDS from SARS-CoV-2 with non-invasive ventilation. HPRA approved this amendment on December 1st 2020 and the REC approved the amendment on December 8th 2020. Patient recruitment commenced in April 2020 and the last patient will be recruited to the trial in April 2021. The last visit of the last patient is anticipated to occur in April 2021.

    "title": "Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency liver disease.",
    "abstract": "The clinical presentation of liver disease is highly variable in homozygous ZZ alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency, and not all patients with the homozygous ZZ genotype develop liver disease. Although not fully identified, there is likely a strong influence of genetic and environmental modifiers of the intracellular injury cascade and fibrotic response. Most ZZ children are well and remain undiagnosed. Of those who come to medical attention, the most common pediatric presentation is neonatal cholestatic hepatitis, sometimes referred to as \"neonatal hepatitis syndrome\". The gold standard for diagnosis of AAT deficiency is analysis of the AAT protein phenotype in the patient serum or the genotype of their DNA genome. Careful follow up of all diagnosed children is important. Heterozygotes for S and Z alleles of AAT (SZ) may develop progressive liver disease similar to ZZ patients and also require close monitoring. There is no specific treatment for AAT deficiency induced liver disease and current therapy remains supportive with management of complications. Rarely, patients require liver transplant and typically the patient outcomes are excellent. With improved understanding of liver injury mechanisms, new strategies for treatment are now being explored, including siRNA technology, molecules to modulate secretion, and enhancers of proteolysis."

    "abstract": "It is known that lung function decline in Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (AATD) varies. Those with a rapid decline are at highest risk of poorer outcomes but may benefit most from targeted treatments including augmentation therapy. Current evidence suggests rapid decliners can be identified after 3 years of serial follow-up. It would be advantageous to identify these patients over a shorter time period, especially in mild disease. Post-bronchodilator spirometry was performed every 6 months for a total of 18 months (4 measurements) by PiZZ AATD patients (ex- or never-smokers) either without spirometric COPD or with mild COPD. Where possible, retrospective spirometry data were included. Decline was assessed using 2 (baseline and 6 month) or four measurements (including baseline, 6, 12 and 18 months) and compared to retrospective decline rates using annual measurements over 3 years. Seventy-two PiZZ AATD patients were included, with 27 having at least three years of retrospective, annual spirometry. 18-month progression obtained by linear regression showed variable degrees of change with 29 showing no decline, 8 showing slow decline and 35 showing rapid decline. Bland-Altman plots showed that there was no overall agreement between predicted rate of decline using data obtained over 6 months and that obtained over 18 months. Furthermore, there was no agreement between rate of decline from either 6 or 18 months' data when compared to data collected over 3 years. The positive predictive value for rapid decline with 18 months of data compared to 3 years was only 50.0%. This study suggests serial lung function over 18 months cannot identify AATD patients who have rapidly declining lung function. There is an urgent need for different biomarkers to help identify these patients at the earliest opportunity."

    "title": "Stepwise Reversion of Multiply Mutated Recombinant Antitrypsin Reveals a Selective Inhibitor of Coagulation Factor XIa as Active as the M358R Variant.",
    "abstract": "Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT, also known as alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor or SERPINA1) is the most abundant member of the serpin superfamily found in human plasma. The naturally occurring variant AAT M358R, altered at the P1 position of the critical reactive center loop (RCL), is re-directed away from inhibition of AAT's chief natural target, neutrophil elastase, and toward accelerated inhibition of thrombin (FIIa), kallikrein (Kal), and other proteases such as factor XIa (FXIa). FXIa is an emerging target for the development of antithrombotic agents, since patients with FXI deficiency are protected from thromboembolic disease and do not exhibit a strong bleeding tendency. Previously, we used phage display, bacterial lysate screening, and combinatorial mutagenesis to identify AAT-RC, an engineered AAT M358R with additional changes between RCL positions P7-P3', <b>C</b>LE<b>VE</b>P<b>R-</b>S<b>TE</b> [with changes bolded and the P1-P1' (R358-S359) reactive center shown as R-S]. AAT-RC was 279- and 16-fold more selective for FXIa/IIa or FXIa/Kal than AAT M358R; the increased selectivity came at a cost of a 2.3-fold decrease in the rate of FXIa inhibition and a 3.3-fold increase in the stoichiometry of inhibition (SI). Here, we asked which alterations in AAT-RC were most important for the observed increases in selectivity for FXIa inhibition. We back-mutated AAT-RC to AAT-RC-1 (P7-P3' FLE<b>VE</b>P<b>R</b>S<b>TE</b>), AAT-RC-2 (P7-P3' FLEA<b>E</b>P<b>R</b>S<b>TE</b>), and AAT RC-3 (P7-P3' FLEAIP<b>R</b>-S<b>TE</b>). Proteins were expressed as cleavable, hexahistidine-tagged glutathione sulfotransferase fusion proteins in <i>E. coli</i> and purified by proteolytic elution from glutathione agarose, with polishing on nickel chelate agarose. Selectivity for FXIa over Kal of AAT-RC-1, -2, and -3 was 14, 21, and 2.3, respectively. AAT-RC-2 inhibited FXIa 31% more rapidly than AAT M358R, with the same SI, and enhanced selectivity for FXIa over Kal, FXa, FXIIa, activated protein C, and FIIa of 25-, 130-, 420-, 440-, and 470-fold, respectively. Structural modeling of the AAT-RC-2/FXIa encounter complex suggested that both E (Glu) substitutions at P3 and P3' may promote FXIa binding via hydrogen bonding to K192 in FXIa. AAT-RC-2 is the most selective and active AAT variant reported to date for FXIa inhibition and will be tested in animal models of thrombosis and bleeding."

    "title": "The Discovery of Endoplasmic Reticulum Storage Disease. The Connection between an H&E Slide and the Brain.",
    "abstract": "The revolutionary evolution in science and technology over the last few decades has made it possible to face more adequately three main challenges of modern medicine: changes in old diseases, the appearance of new diseases, and diseases that are unknown (mostly genetic), despite research efforts. In this paper we review the road travelled by pathologists in search of a method based upon the use of routine instruments and techniques which once were available for research only. The application to tissue studies of techniques from immunology, molecular biology, and genetics has allowed dynamic interpretations of biological phenomena with special regard to gene regulation and expression. That implies stepwise investigations, including light microscopy, immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, electron microscopy, molecular histopathology, protein crystallography, and gene sequencing, in order to progress from suggestive features detectable in routinely stained preparations to more characteristic, specific, and finally, pathognomonic features. Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E)-stained preparations and appropriate immunohistochemical stains have enabled the recognition of phenotypic changes which may reflect genotypic alterations. That has been the case with hepatocytic inclusions detected in H&E-stained preparations, which appeared to correspond to secretory proteins that, due to genetic mutations, were retained within the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) and were deficient in plasma. The identification of this phenomenon affecting the molecules alpha-1-antitrypsin and fibrinogen has led to the discovery of a new field of cell organelle pathology, endoplasmic reticulum storage disease(s) (ERSD). Over fifty years, pathologists have wandered through a dark forest of complicated molecules with strange conformations, and by detailed observations in simple histopathological sections, accompanied by a growing background of molecular techniques and revelations, have been able to recognize and identify arrays of grotesque polypeptide arrangements."

    "abstract": "Alpha-1-Antitrypsin deficiency (AATD), caused by <i>SERPINA1</i> mutations, is one of the most prevalent Mendelian disorders among individuals of European descend. However, this condition, which is characterized by reduced serum levels of alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT) and associated with increased risks of pulmonary emphysema and liver disease in both children and adults, remains frequently underdiagnosed. AATD clinical manifestations are often correlated with two pathogenic variants, the Z allele (p.Glu342Lys) and the S allele (p.Glu264Val), which can be combined in severe ZZ or moderate SZ risk genotypes. Yet, screenings of AATD cases and large sequencing efforts carried out in both control and disease populations are disclosing outstanding numbers of rare <i>SERPINA1</i> variants (>500), including many pathogenic and other likely deleterious mutations. Generally speaking, pathogenic variants can be subdivided into either loss- or gain-of-function according to their pathophysiological effects. In AATD, the loss-of-function is correlated with an uncontrolled activity of elastase by its natural inhibitor, the AAT. This phenomenon can result from the absence of circulating AAT (null alleles), poor AAT secretion from hepatocytes (deficiency alleles) or even from a modified inhibitory activity (dysfunctional alleles). On the other hand, the gain-of-function is connected with the formation of AAT polymers and their switching on of cellular stress and inflammatory responses (deficiency alleles). Less frequently, the gain-of-function is related to a modified protease affinity (dysfunctional alleles). Here, we revisit <i>SERPINA1</i> mutation spectrum, its origins and population history with a greater emphasis on variants fitting the aforementioned processes of AATD pathogenesis. Those were selected based on their clinical significance and wider geographic distribution. Moreover, we also provide some directions for future studies of AATD clinically heterogeneity and comprehensive diagnosis."

They still did not have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or any identifiable change in traditional pulmonary function tests but already have change in nitrogen washout tests. Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is a genetic disorder associated with early-onset COPD. There is evidence that although patients who have well-preserved FEV<sub>1</sub> may already have signs of emphysema associated with symptoms. Therefore, the nitrogen washout test is considered to have more sensitive outcomes than other pulmonary function tests for early investigation of small airways disease and could allow the monitoring pulmonary function and evaluating of therapeutic decision."

    "abstract": "The acute phase protein α1-antitrypsin (AAT) inhibits numerous proteases, specifically neutrophil elastase. Patients with an AAT deficiency due to mutations frequently develop early onset emphysema. The commercial preparations of human plasma AAT are clinically used as biopharmaceuticals to protect the lung tissue of AAT-deficient patients from damage caused by neutrophil elastase. Accordingly, preparations of AAT are validated for their anti-elastase activity. However, several anti-inflammatory effects of AAT were described, some of them being independent from its anti-protease function. We recently demonstrated that AAT isolated from the blood of healthy persons efficiently inhibits the ATP-induced release of interleukin-1β by human monocytes. This finding is of therapeutic relevance, because IL-1β plays an important role in numerous debilitating and life-threatening inflammatory diseases. As anti-inflammatory functions of AAT are of increasing clinical interest, we compared the potential of two widely used AAT preparations, Prolastin® and Respreeza®, to inhibit the ATP-induced release of IL-1β using human monocytic U937 cells. We detected marked functional differences between both medicaments. The AAT preparation Respreeza® is less active compared to Prolastin® regarding the inhibition of the ATP-induced release of monocytic IL-1β. Chemical oxidation of Respreeza® restored this anti-inflammatory activity, while destroying its anti-protease function. Our data suggest that the anti-inflammatory potential and the anti-protease function of AAT can be fully uncoupled. In the light of the increasing clinical interest in anti-inflammatory functions of AAT, commercial AAT preparations should be carefully reinvestigated and optimized to preserve the dual anti-protease and anti-inflammatory activity of native AAT."

Our aim was to evaluate the risk of VTE in individuals with severe AATD compared with control subjects from the general population. Individuals with severe AATD (n = 1577) were recruited from the Swedish national AATD register. Control subjects (n = 5969) were selected from the OLIN (Obstructive Lung Disease in Northern Sweden) studies, that include a random general population sample. Longitudinal data on VTE and diagnoses were obtained from the Swedish National Patient Registry. Associations were analyzed using multivariable Cox regression. At inclusion, 46% of the AATD individuals and 53% of the controls were never-smokers. COPD was present in 46% of the AATD individuals compared with 4% of the controls. During a median follow-up of 18 years, 116 (7%) of the AATD individuals and 89 (1%) of the control subjects developed VTE, unadjusted hazard ratio 6.5 (95% confidence interval 4.9-8.6). Risk factors for incident VTE were male gender, age, COPD, cancer, and liver disease. Adjusting for these factors, the AATD individuals had a significantly higher risk of incident VTE, adjusted hazard ratio 4.2 (95% confidence interval 2.9-6.2) as compared with the controls. Subjects with severe AATD have considerably increased risk of developing VTE compared with the general population, even after accounting for risk factors. This calls for optimized risk factor management and clinical follow-up of this patient group."

    "abstract": "Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a significantly under-diagnosed genetic condition caused by reduced levels and/or functionality of alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT), predisposing individuals to lung, liver or other systemic diseases. The management of individuals with the PI*MZ genotype, characterized by mild or moderate AAT deficiency, is less clear than of those with the most common severe deficiency genotype (PI*ZZ). Recent genetic data suggest that the PI*MZ genotype may be significantly more prevalent than currently thought. The only specific treatment for lung disease associated with severe AATD is the intravenous infusion of AAT augmentation therapy, which has been shown to slow disease progression in PI*ZZ individuals. There is no specific evidence for the clinical benefit of AAT therapy in PI*MZ individuals, and the risk of emphysema development in this group remains controversial. As such, current guidelines do not support the use of AAT augmentation in PI*MZ individuals. Here, we discuss the limited data on the PI*MZ genotype and offer pro and con perspectives on pursuing an AAT-specific therapeutic strategy in PI*MZ individuals with lung disease. Ultimately, further research to demonstrate the safety, risk/benefit balance and efficacy of AAT therapy in PI*MZ individuals is needed."

Small molecules that bind and stabilise Z α<sub>1</sub>-antitrypsin were identified via a DNA-encoded library screen. A subsequent structure based optimisation led to a series of highly potent, selective and cellular active α1-antitrypsin correctors."

    "abstract": "Medical literature on the prevalence of genetic liver disease is lacking. In this study, we investigated the in-hospital healthcare and economic burden from genetic causes of non-alcoholic chronic liver disease (NACLD) and non-alcoholic liver cirrhosis (NALC) in the USA. Data were abstracted from the National Inpatient Sample database between 2002 and 2014 using ICD9 codes for patients discharged with NACLD and NALC secondary to genetic diseases including alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (A1ATd), cystic fibrosis (CF), Wilson disease (WD), hereditary hemochromatosis (HHC), glycogen storage disease, and disorders of aromatic amino-acid metabolism (DAAAM). Throughout the study period, there were 19,332 discharges for NACLD associated with the six genetic diseases including 14,368 for NALC. There were $1.09 billion in hospital charges, 790 in-hospital deaths, and 955 liver transplants performed. Overall, A1ATd was associated with 8,983 (62.52%) hospitalizations for NALC followed by WD, CF, and HHC. The highest in-hospital mortality was seen with HHC. The greatest frequency of liver transplants was seen with DAAAM. The number of hospitalizations for genetic liver diseases continues to increase. With increased funding and directed research efforts, we can aim to improve medical treatments and the quality of life for patients at risk for liver deterioration."

    "abstract": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a new disease that we do not know yet how to treat, is rapidly evolving and has forced us to stay indoors. Surprisingly, a broad range of symptoms has been reported since COVID-19 emergence. Individual variations in susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 can be due to non-genetic and genetic factors. Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is an inherited condition that is associated with an increased risk of liver and lung diseases which may increase susceptibility to COVID-19 infection. At the same time, there could be a possibility of developing non-hereditary AATD. In addition to some evidence showing the role of vitamin D deficiency in COVID-19 pathology, it has been recognized that there is a biological link between AAT and vitamin D. Therefore, here we offer a new perspective that lower vitamin D levels in COVID-19 patients can cause acquired AATD that provide a condition with more disease severity and a higher risk of death. As a consequence, COVID-19 individuals with vitamin D deficiency may have a higher risk of morbidity and mortality. Therefore, early vitamin D and AAT assessments and optimal interventions could be helpful to prevent severe COVID-19 outcomes."

    "abstract": "Obesity-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress contributes to low-grade chronic inflammation in adipose tissue and may cause metabolic disorders such as diabetes mellitus and dyslipidemia. Identification of high serpina A1 (alpha-1 antitrypsin, A1AT) expression in mouse adipose tissue and adipocytes prompted us to explore the role of A1AT in the inflammatory response of adipocytes under ER stress. We aimed to determine the role of A1AT expression in adipocytes with ER stress during regulation of adipocyte homeostasis and inflammation. To this end, we chemically induced ER stress in A1AT small interfering RNA-transfected differentiating adipocytes using thapsigargin. Induction of CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP), an ER stress marker, by thapsigargin was lower in A1AT-deficient SW872 adipocytes. Thapsigargin or the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α increased basal expression of cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-8 in both SW872 and primary omental adipocytes. This thapsigargin- or TNFα-induced expression of proinflammatory genes was increased by A1AT deficiency. These findings indicate that adipose A1AT may suppress the ER stress response to block excessive expression of proinflammatory factors, which suggests that A1AT protects against adipose tissue dysfunction associated with ER stress activation."

    "abstract": "The presence of modifier genes is now well recognized in severe liver disease outcome associated with alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency (A1ATD) but their identification remains to be fully elucidated. To address this goal, we performed a candidate gene study with the SORL1 gene, already identified as risk gene in early-onset Alzheimer Disease families. A particular SORL1 micro-haplotype constituted with 3 SNPs (wild-type form TTG) was genotyped on 86 ZZ A1ATD children issued from 66 families. Interestingly, the mutated forms of this micro-haplotype (CAT most of the time) were associated with lower occurrence of severe liver disease and in cellulo studies showed that SORL1 influences Z-A1ATD cellular toxicity and biogenesis. These data suggest that the mutated CAT form of SORL1 micro-haplotype may partly prevent from severe liver disease in A1ATD children. Overall, these findings support a replication study on an independent cohort and additional in cellulo studies to confirm these promising results."

    "abstract": "Aneurysms of the posterior circulation pose a unique challenge due to higher rupture rates, higher recurrence rates following endovascular treatment, and extended open cranial base approaches required to reach the ventrally located brainstem circulation. While endovascular therapy has made tremendous strides in successful treatment for most posterior circulation aneurysms, open microscopic approaches remain essential in specific circumstances. Here, we present a case of a patient who presented with acute, severe headache, and sixth nerve palsies, and who was found to have hydrocephalus and a dissecting aneurysm at the anterolateral medullary segment of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA). Interestingly, this patient had a history of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency that has been linked with spontaneous aortic and cervical arterial dissections. The fusiform geometry of the dissecting aneurysm was deemed suboptimal for endovascular treatment, so an open microsurgical approach for occipital artery to PICA bypass and aneurysm trapping was planned. Because this patient had cerebral edema in the setting of a ruptured aneurysm and hydrocephalus, a far lateral craniotomy combined with drilling of the occipital condyle and jugular tubercle was critical to enhance exposure of the first segment of the PICA and to minimize brain retraction. In this video, we highlight the key steps and nuances for harvest of the occipital artery, achieving control of the extracranial vertebral artery, performing the transcondylar and transtubercular far lateral approach, and bypass with trapping technique for these challenging posterior circulation aneurysms.

This study aimed to identify factors associated with presence and development of hypercapnia. 1224 patients, 637 with COPD and 587 with alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD), from 4 previously established patient cohorts, were included in cross-sectional analyses of hypercapnia (PaCO<sub>2</sub> ≥ 6.5 kPa or 48.8 mmHg), focusing on phenotypic features of COPD and mortality. Longitudinal associations of rising PaCO<sub>2</sub> were also assessed. A second cohort of 160 COPD patients underwent sleep studies and 1-year follow-up, analysing in a similar way, incorporating additional information from their sleep studies if appropriate. Hypercapnia was 15 times more common in usual COPD than AATD (<i>p</i> < 0.01) after adjustment for baseline differences by regression. Independent predictors of hypercapnia in COPD included FEV<sub>1</sub> and current use of oxygen; these variables, together with lack of emphysema, explained 11% of variance in CO<sub>2</sub>. Increasing PaCO<sub>2</sub> also associated with higher risk of death (<i>p</i>=0.03). 44/160 patients exhibited sleep disordered breathing. The sleep study cohort also showed an association of low FEV<sub>1</sub> with hypercapnia. Prior hospital admission for AHRF was also clinically significant, being a feature of almost double the number of hypercapnic patients in both test and sleep study COPD cohorts. Lower FEV<sub>1</sub> and prior AHRF are the main associations of hypercapnia in COPD, which carries a poor prognosis, particularly worsening over time."

    "abstract": "Alpha-1 antitrypsin (A1AT) is one of the acute phase proteins which are synthesized in the liver. A1AT inhibits the activity of many proteases, but its main task is to protect the lungs from the attack of neutrophil elastase. In an autosomal hereditary disease known as alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, the A1AT level in blood serum decreases, increasing the risk of developing emphysema, liver apoptosis, and liver cancer. Thus, the detection of A1AT concentration in blood serum is very important. In this study, an impedimetric biosensor was developed, forming an SAM (self-assembled monolayer) with 4-mercaptophenylacetic acid (4MPA) on the surface of the gold electrode. An A1AT biosensor was constructed using immobilization of an A1AT-specific antibody (anti-A1AT) after activating the carboxyl groups of 4MPA with EDC/NHS. Each immobilization stage was characterized by using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, and scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. With the designed biosensor, precise and highly reproducible results were obtained for A1AT concentrations in the range of 100-600 µg/mL. A1AT detection was also successfully carried out in artificial serum solutions spiked with A1AT."

Even though AATD is one of the most widespread inherited diseases in Caucasian populations, only a minority of affected individuals has been detected. Whereas methods have been validated for AATD testing, there is no universally-established algorithm for the detection and diagnosis of the disorder. In order to compare different methods for diagnosing AATD, we carried out a systematic review of the literature on AATD diagnostic algorithms. Complete biochemical and molecular analyses of 5,352 samples processed in our laboratory were retrospectively studied using each of the selected algorithms. When applying the diagnostic algorithms to the same samples, the frequency of False Negatives varied from 1.94 to 12.9%, the frequency of True Negatives was 62.91% for each algorithm and the frequency of True Positives ranged from 24.19 to 35.15%. We, therefore, highlighted some differences among Negative Predictive Values, ranging from 0.83 to 0.97. Accordingly, the sensitivity of each algorithm ranged between 0.61 and 0.95. We also postulated 1.108 g/L as optimal AAT cut-off value, in absence of inflammatory status, which points to the possible presence of genetic AATD. The choice of the diagnostic algorithm has a significant impact on the correct diagnosis of AATD, which is essential for appropriate treatment and medical care. The fairly large number of possible false negative diagnoses revealed by the present paper should also warn clinicians of negative results in patients with clinically-suspected AATD."

Nephropathy due to AATD is still very rare and only a few cohort studies have been reported. It has been recognised that alpha-1 antitrypsin has a protective role in the kidneys which enhances the possibility of development of kidney failure, such as nephrotic syndrome, in cases of AATD. Further clinical investigation is needed to understand the relationship between the development of nephropathy, namely membranous nephropathy, and AATD."

    "abstract": "The maintenance of proteome homeostasis, or proteostasis, is crucial for preserving cellular functions and for cellular adaptation to environmental challenges and changes in physiological conditions. The capacity of cells to maintain proteostasis requires precise control and coordination of protein synthesis, folding, conformational maintenance, and clearance. Thus, protein degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) or the autophagy-lysosomal system plays an essential role in cellular functions. However, failure of the UPS or the autophagic process can lead to the development of various diseases (aging-associated diseases, cancer), thus both these pathways have become attractive targets in the treatment of protein conformational diseases, such as alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency (AATD). The Z alpha 1-antitrypsin (Z-AAT) misfolded variant of the serine protease alpha 1-antitrypsin (AAT) is caused by a structural change that predisposes it to protein aggregation and dramatic accumulation in the form of inclusion bodies within liver hepatocytes. This can lead to clinically significant liver disease requiring liver transplantation in childhood or adulthood. Treatment of mice with autophagy enhancers was found to reduce hepatic Z-AAT aggregate levels and protect them from AATD hepatotoxicity. To date, liver transplantation is the only curative therapeutic option for patients with AATD-mediated liver disease. Therefore, the development and discovery of new therapeutic approaches to delay or overcome disease progression is a top priority. Herein, we review AATD-mediated liver disease and the overall process of autophagy. We highlight the role of this system in the regulation of Z-variant degradation and its implication in AATD-medicated liver disease, including some open questions that remain challenges in the field and require further elucidation. Finally, we discuss how manipulation of autophagy could provide multiple routes of therapeutic benefit in AATD-mediated liver disease."

    "abstract": "Loss of insulin-secreting pancreatic β cells through apoptosis contributes to the progression of type 2 diabetes, but underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we identify a pathway in which the cell death inhibitor ARC paradoxically becomes a killer during diabetes. While cytoplasmic ARC maintains β cell viability and pancreatic architecture, a pool of ARC relocates to the nucleus to induce β cell apoptosis in humans with diabetes and several pathophysiologically distinct mouse models. β cell death results through the coordinate downregulation of serpins (serine protease inhibitors) not previously known to be synthesized and secreted by β cells. Loss of the serpin α<sub>1</sub>-antitrypsin from the extracellular space unleashes elastase, triggering the disruption of β cell anchorage and subsequent cell death. Administration of α<sub>1</sub>-antitrypsin to mice with diabetes prevents β cell death and metabolic abnormalities. These data uncover a pathway for β cell loss in type 2 diabetes and identify an FDA-approved drug that may impede progression of this syndrome."

    "abstract": "Clinical heterogeneity has been demonstrated in alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD), such that clinical suspicion plays an important role in its diagnosis. The PiZZ genotype is the most common severe deficiency genotype and so tends to result in the worst clinical presentation, hence it has been the major focus of research. However, milder genotypes, especially PiSZ and PiMZ, are also linked to the development of lung and liver disease, mainly when unhealthy behaviors are present, such as smoking and alcohol use. Monitoring and managing AATD patients remains an area of active research. Lung function tests or computed tomography (CT) densitometry may allow physicians to identify progressive disease during follow up of patients, with a view to decision making about AATD-specific therapy, like augmentation therapy, or eventually surgical procedures such as lung volume reduction or transplant. Different types of biological markers have been suggested for disease monitoring and therapy selection, although most need further investigation. Intravenous augmentation therapy reduces the progression of emphysema in PiZZ patients and is available in many European countries, but its effect in milder deficiency is less certain. AATD has also been suggested to represent a risk factor and trigger for pulmonary infections, like those induced by mycobacteria. We summarize the last 5-10 years' key findings in AATD diagnosis, assessment, and management, with a focus on milder deficiency variants."

In this case report, a 48-year-old woman with homozygous ZZ AAT deficiency presented with abdominal pain, and by imaging, an abnormal area in the liver was found. The initial differential diagnosis consisted of benign abnormalities but a malignancy could not be ruled out. Finally, this abnormality turned out to be an intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA) in a non-cirrhotic liver. Since this type of tumour has been very infrequently described to be associated with AAT deficiency, the question remains whether alpha-1 trypsin accumulation in the hepatocytes was responsible for the development of iCCA. However, other associated factors for developing an iCCA were ruled out."

AAT deficiency results from pathogenic variants in the <i>SERPINA1</i> gene encoding AAT and the common mutant Z allele of <i>SERPINA1</i> encodes for Z α1-antitrypsin (ATZ), a protein forming hepatotoxic polymers retained in the endoplasmic reticulum of hepatocytes. PiZ mice express the human ATZ and are a valuable model to investigate the human liver disease of AAT deficiency. In this study, we investigated differential expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) between PiZ and control mice and found that miR-34b/c was up-regulated and its levels correlated with intrahepatic ATZ. Furthermore, in PiZ mouse livers, we found that Forkhead Box O3 (FOXO3) driving microRNA-34b/c (miR-34b/c) expression was activated and miR-34b/c expression was dependent upon c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) phosphorylation on Ser<sup>574</sup> Deletion of miR-34b/c in PiZ mice resulted in early development of liver fibrosis and increased signaling of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), a target of miR-34b/c. Activation of FOXO3 and increased miR-34c were confirmed in livers of humans with AAT deficiency. In addition, JNK-activated FOXO3 and miR-34b/c up-regulation were detected in several mouse models of liver fibrosis.

Immediately echocardiography was done and depicted cardiac tamponade. Pericardiocentesis was performed and a significant amount of haemorrhagic fluid was removed. Further workup revealed deranged coagulation parameters, cholestatic liver disease, and reduced α-1-antitrypsin levels. Despite normal brain sonography, a small cerebral haemorrhage was detected on magnetic resonance imaging. A genetic test finally proofed homozygotic mutation of the SERPINA1-gene and confirmed the diagnosis of α-1-antitrypsin deficiency as the underlaying cause. After initial replacement of coagulation factors, erythrocytes and vitamin K, the infant recovered. Eighteen weeks after discharge, the infant is still on vitamin K supplementation. She did not have any further bleedings and no neurologic or developmental impairment. Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency can lead to vitamin K deficiency in young infants even with adequate prophylaxis.

Imaging findings demonstrated multiple cystic thin walled airways, compatible with bronchiectatic changes in the upper, middle and lower lobes bilaterally, bronchial wall thickening with air-fluid levels prominent in the fifth and sixth generation bronchial divisions, with normal calibre trachea and central bronchi. These radiological findings are consistent with diagnosis of Williams-Campbell syndrome, which was diagnosed after ruling out the other common causes of bronchiectasis. Williams-Campbell syndrome is a rare congenital cystic lung disease, the diagnosis of which is made by exclusion of common causes of bronchiectasis such as cystic fibrosis, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, tuberculosis, dyskinetic cilia syndrome and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency.

Patients were assessed using a specific clerking pro forma and transient elastography (TE). Discharge to primary care with lifestyle advice was considered where TE<7.9 kPa. 904 patients were identified, 114 (12.6%) of whom did not meet NAFLD criteria. Among the NAFLD population (n=790 (87.4%)), TE<7.9 kPa was present in 558 patients (70.6%), 519 of whom were discharged to primary care.

    "title": "Dual proteotoxic stress accelerates liver injury via activation of p62-Nrf2.",
    "abstract": "Protein accumulation is the hallmark of various neuronal, muscular, and other human disorders. It is also often seen in the liver as a major protein-secretory organ. For example, aggregation of mutated alpha1-antitrypsin (AAT), referred to as PiZ, is a characteristic feature of AAT deficiency, whereas retention of hepatitis B surface protein (HBs) is found in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) infection. We investigated the interaction of both proteotoxic stresses in humans and mice. Animals overexpressing both PiZ and HBs (HBs-PiZ mice) had greater liver injury, steatosis, and fibrosis. Later they exhibited higher hepatocellular carcinoma load and a more aggressive tumor subtype. Although PiZ and HBs displayed differing solubility properties and distinct distribution patterns, HBs-PiZ animals manifested retention of AAT/HBs in the degradatory pathway and a marked accumulation of the autophagy adaptor p62. Isolation of p62-containing particles revealed retained HBs/AAT and the lipophagy adapter perilipin-2. p62 build-up led to activation of the p62-Nrf2 axis and emergence of reactive oxygen species. Our results demonstrate that the simultaneous presence of two prevalent proteotoxic stresses promotes the development of liver injury due to protein retention and activation of the p62-Nrf2 axis. In humans, the PiZ variant was over-represented in CHB patients with advanced liver fibrosis (unadjusted odds ratio = 9.92 [1.15-85.39]). Current siRNA approaches targeting HBs/AAT should be considered for these individuals. © 2021 The Authors.

The aim of this study was to determine if there was an increase in alpha-1 antitrypsin deficient alleles or phenotypes in a large series of PLCH patients and whether serum alpha-1 antitrypsin levels correlated with markers of disease severity. Fifty PLCH patients, 24 with a diffuse cystic lung pattern and 26 with a typical nodulo-cystic pattern on imaging were included. The mean alpha-1 antitrypsin levels were in normal range for both the population with diffuse cystic lung pattern population (1.39 g/L ± 0.37) and the nodulo-cystic pattern group (1.41 g/L ± 0.21). Deficiency alleles PiZ and PiS were 1% and 2% respectively in the entire study population of 50 patients, demonstrating no increased incidence of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency in PLCH. Alpha-1 antitrypsin levels showed no correlation with lung function parameters or extent of cystic lesions on lung computed tomography."

    "abstract": "The ZZ genotype of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is strongly associated with COPD, even in never-smokers. Moderate AATD genotypes (MZ and SZ) have been shown to increase the severity of COPD in smokers. In this comparative study, we examine the association between AATD, genotypes, and smoking cessation. Two hundred and ninety-three Irish people with AATD [MZ (<i>n</i> = 91), SZ (<i>n</i> = 72), and ZZ/rare (<i>n</i> = 130)] completed a custom questionnaire assessing their social and smoking histories. The primary outcomes analyzed were the predictors of ever-smoking and effect of genotype on awareness of AATD and maintained smoking cessation, using logistic regression analyses. Parental smoking exposure was associated with ever-smoking status (OR 1.84 vs. no parental smoking, <i>p</i> = 0.018), higher cumulative tobacco consumption (23.47 vs. 14.87 pack-years, <i>p</i> = 0.005) and more quit attempts required to achieve cessation among former-smokers (2.97 vs. 5.60, <i>p</i> = 0.007). Awareness of genotype was 67.7% versus 56.3% versus 33% for ZZ, SZ, and MZ, respectively (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Among ever-smokers, current-smoking was uncommon (2.5% vs. 17% vs. 16% for ZZ, SZ, and MZ, respectively, <i>p</i> = 0.009) with ZZs significantly less likely to be current-smokers (OR 0.15 relative to MZ, <i>p</i> = 0.025). These results suggest that the genetic risk of COPD in AATD families is compounded by transmission of social risk factors (<i>via</i> parental smoking). Increasing severity of genotype is associated with lower current-smoking rates among ever-smokers. Whether this is attributable to greater awareness of risk is an area of interest. Achieving a change in smoking habits may also result in positive health behavior in subsequent generations."

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 was first reported from China. Within three months, it evolved to 10 additional subtypes. Two evolved subtypes (A2 and A2a) carry a non-synonymous Spike protein mutation (D614G). We conducted phylodynamic analysis of over 70,000 SARS-CoV-2 coronaviruses worldwide, sequenced until July2020, and found that the mutant subtype (614G) outcompeted the pre-existing type (614D), significantly faster in Europe and North-America than in East Asia. Bioinformatically and computationally, we identified a novel neutrophil elastase (ELANE) cleavage site introduced in the G-mutant, near the S1-S2 junction of the Spike protein. We hypothesised that elevation of neutrophil elastase level at the site of infection will enhance the activation of Spike protein thus facilitating host cell entry for 614G, but not the 614D, subtype. The level of neutrophil elastase in the lung is modulated by its inhibitor α1-antitrypsin (AAT). AAT prevents lung tissue damage by elastase. However, many individuals exhibit genotype-dependent deficiency of AAT. AAT deficiency eases host-cell entry of the 614G virus, by retarding inhibition of neutrophil elastase and consequently enhancing activation of the Spike protein. AAT deficiency is highly prevalent in European and North-American populations, but much less so in East Asia. Therefore, the 614G subtype is able to infect and spread more easily in populations of the former regions than in the latter region. Our analyses provide a molecular biological and evolutionary model for the higher observed virulence of the 614G subtype, in terms of causing higher morbidity in the host (higher infectivity and higher viral load), than the non-mutant 614D subtype."

    "abstract": "Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) is a major inhibitor of serine proteases in mammals. Therefore, its deficiency leads to protease-antiprotease imbalance and a risk for developing lung emphysema. Although therapy with human plasma-purified AAT attenuates AAT deficiency-related emphysema, its impact on lung antibacterial immunity is poorly defined. Here, we examined the effect of AAT therapy on lung protective immunity in AAT-deficient (KO) mice challenged with Streptococcus pneumoniae. AAT-KO mice were highly susceptible to S. pneumoniae, as determined by severe lobar pneumonia and early mortality. Mechanistically, we found that neutrophil-derived elastase (NE) degraded the opsonophagocytically important collectins, surfactant protein A (SP-A) and D (SP-D), which was accompanied by significantly impaired lung bacterial clearance in S. pneumoniae-infected AAT-KO mice. Treatment of S. pneumoniae-infected AAT-KO mice with human AAT protected SP-A and SP-D from NE-mediated degradation and corrected the pulmonary pathology observed in these mice. Likewise, treatment with Sivelestat, a specific inhibitor of NE, also protected collectins from degradation and significantly decreased bacterial loads in S. pneumoniae-infected AAT-KO mice. Our findings show that NE is responsible for the degradation of lung SP-A and SP-D in AAT-KO mice affecting lung protective immunity in AAT deficiency."

    "abstract": "Alpha 1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (AATD) is a rare condition primarily associated with lung complications and liver disease. As disease symptoms are similar to those in other respiratory conditions, patients generally experience long delays before receiving an accurate diagnosis and treatment. AATD results from mutations in the <i>SERPINA1</i> gene that encodes Alpha 1 Antitrypsin (AAT). Over 500 single-nucleotide variants have been reported in mutation databases; however, there is increasing interest in the clinical significance of rare and novel <i>SERPINA1</i> variants. In this case series of four patients from a single US center, next-generation sequencing (NGS) was used to guide AATD diagnosis. Four distinct rare variants of <i>SERPINA1</i> (P289S; I50N; E204K; H262Y) were identified, three of which were found in patients with advanced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)/emphysema. Computational modeling predicted these mutations to have potentially deleterious effects, a finding supported by AAT levels that were comparable with those seen in individuals heterozygous for the most common deficiency allele (PI*MZ). The remaining mutation (E204K) was found in a patient with a cerebral aneurysm; potential links between <i>SERPINA1</i> variants and neurological conditions, such as cerebral aneurysm and arterial dissections, have been previously reported in individuals with heterozygous AATD phenotypes (PI*MS and PI*MZ). Novel and rare variants, often not detected by basic AATD diagnostic tests, have the potential to contribute to the development of COPD and emphysema. Detection of these variants can be enhanced by NGS, and modeling techniques can help determine if variants are pathogenic, thereby enabling a quicker, more accurate AATD diagnosis."

    "abstract": "Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a hereditary disorder involving lungs, characterized by low serum concentration of the protein alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) also called proteinase inhibitor (PI). Asthma is common in AATD patients, but there are only few data on respiratory function in asthmatic patients with AATD. The aim of the study was to evaluate lung function in asthmatic outpatients with mutation in the SERPINA1 gene coding for AAT versus asthmatic subjects without mutation. We performed the quantitative analysis of the serum concentration of AAT in 600 outpatients affected by mild to moderate asthma from the University Hospital of Parma, Italy. Fifty-seven of them underwent the genetic analysis subsequently; they were subdivided into mutated and non-mutated subjects. All the mutated patients had a heterozygous genotype, except 1 (PI*SS). We assessed the lung function through a flow-sensing spirometer and the small airway parameters through an impulse oscillometry system. The values of forced vital capacity (% predicted) and those of the residual volume to total lung capacity ratio (%) were, respectively, lower and higher in patients mutated versus patients without mutation, showing a significantly greater air trapping (p = 0.014 and p = 0.017, respectively). Moreover, patients with mutation in comparison to patients without mutation showed lower forced expiratory volume in 3 s (% predicted) and forced expiratory volume in 6 s (L) spirometric values, reflecting a smaller airways contribution. In asthmatic patients, heterozygosity for AAT with PI*MZ and PI*MS genotypes was associated with small airway dysfunction and with lung air trapping."

    "abstract": "Genetic variants of small airways and interstitial pulmonary disease have not been comprehensively studied. This cluster of respiratory disorders usually manifests from early infancy ('lung disease in utero'). In this study, 24 variants linked to these entities are described. The variants involved two genes associated with surfactant metabolism dysfunction (ABCA3 and CSF2RB), two with pulmonary fibrosis (MUC5B and SFTP), one with bronchiectasis (SCNN1B), and one with alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency (SERPINA1). A nonsense variant, MUC5B:c.16861G > T, p.Glu5621*, was found in homozygous state in two siblings with severe respiratory disease from birth. One of the siblings also had heterozygous SFTPA1:c.675C > G, p.Asn225Lys, which resulted in a more severe respiratory disease. The sibling with only the homozygous MUC5B variant had lung biopsy, which showed alveolar simplification, interstitial fibrosis, intra-alveolar lipid-laden macrophages, and foci of foreign body giant cell reaction in distal airspaces. Two missense variants, MUC5B:c.14936 T > C, p.Ile4979Thr (rs201287218) and MUC5B:c.16738G > A, p.Gly5580Arg (rs776709402), were also found in compound heterozygous state in two siblings with severe respiratory disease from birth. Overall, the results emphasize the need for genetic studies for patients with complex respiratory problems. Identifying pathogenic variants, such as those presented here, assists in effective family counseling aimed at genetic prevention. In addition, results of genetic studies improve the clinical care and provide opportunities for participating in clinical trials, such as those involving molecularly-targeted therapies."

Evidence regarding management is limited to case reports and small case series. We sought to clarify typical features and investigation of AATD-associated panniculitis and assess the evidence regarding therapeutic options. Articles and abstracts published between 1970 and 2020 were identified by searches of MEDLINE, PubMed, and secondary searches of references from relevant articles using the search terms \"panniculitis,\" \"alpha-1,\" \"antitrypsin,\" \"deficiency,\" and \"Weber-Christian.\" We identified 117 cases of AATD-associated panniculitis. In 1 series, AATD was present in 15% of all cases of biopsy-proven panniculitis. Failure to achieve clinical response was seen in all instances of systemic steroid use. Dapsone, although effective and accessible, is frequently associated with failure to achieve remission. In these instances, intravenous AAT augmentation therapy generally resulted in response. AATD may be more prevalent among patients presenting with panniculitis than previously thought. Patients presenting with panniculitis and systemic illness show high mortality risk. Although most cases are associated with the severe ZZ-genotype, moderate genotypes may also predispose to panniculitis. Dapsone remains the most cost-effective therapeutic option, whereas intravenous AAT augmentation remains the most efficacious. Finally, glucocorticoids appear ineffective in this setting."

    "abstract": "As a known genetic cause of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) can cause severe respiratory problems at a relatively young age. These problems are caused by decreased or absent levels of alpha1-antitrypsin (AAT), an antiprotease which is primarily functional in the respiratory system. If the levels of AAT fall below the protective threshold of 11 µM, the neutrophil-derived serine proteases neutrophil elastase (NE) and proteinase 3 (PR3), which are targets of AAT, are not sufficiently inhibited, resulting in excessive degradation of the lung parenchyma, increased inflammation, and increased susceptibility to infections. Because other therapies are still in the early phases of development, the only therapy currently available for AATD is AAT augmentation therapy. The controversy surrounding AAT augmentation therapy concerns its efficiency, as protection of lung function decline is not demonstrated, despite the treatment's proven significant effect on lung density change in the long term. In this review article, novel biomarkers of NE and PR3 activity and their use to assess the efficacy of AAT augmentation therapy are discussed. Furthermore, a series of seven synthetic NE and PR3 inhibitors that can be used to evaluate the specificity of the novel biomarkers, and with potential as new drugs, are discussed."

We also examine preclinical and clinical data on the utility of oligonucleotides in silencing the expression of genes responsible for metabolic liver diseases.<b>Expert opinion</b>: The liver has numerous susceptible molecular therapeutic targets; hence, metabolic liver diseases can be treated effectively by modulating these targets via novel therapeutic oligonucleotides. Undoubtedly, these exciting developments integrate well with precision medicine progress. Specific therapeutic oligonucleotides can be designed based on the exact underlying molecular mechanism of the disease. So, there is a justification for furthering the development of therapeutic oligonucleotides for metabolic liver diseases.

    "abstract": "Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has emerged as a pandemic leading to unprecedented disruption of global health and economy. Transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) has been found to be critical in priming the viral spike protein and the host ACE2 receptor before the virus enters into the host cell. Recent studies have experimentally demonstrated that Alpha 1 antitrypsin (encoded by SERPINA1 gene) is an inhibitor of TMPRSS2 and provided support to the already approved therapy as a candidate for COVID-19. Interestingly Alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency is common among Europeans. Here we have provided in silico evidence that Alpha 1 antitrypsin can interact with TMPRSS2 and both of them are co-expressed in the human liver and lung. We then analyzed the gnomAD dataset to show that Europeans and Latinos have a substantially higher carrier frequency of Alpha 1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (~12%) compared to other large ethnicities. Therefore, we hypothesize that Alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency might be a risk factor for severe infection with SARS-CoV-2. We propose Alpha 1 antitrypsin status as a potential prognostic predictor of COVID-19 outcome."

A survey on 164 research questions was electronically sent to 230 AATD experts in Europe, and 94 completed surveys from 24 countries were received. The top research areas identified by healthcare providers were causes of variable progression and poor outcomes, improvement in diagnosis, initiation and optimal dosing of augmentation therapy and effectiveness of self-management interventions. During the same period, 438 surveys were completed by patients and caregivers from 26 countries. The top research areas identified were improving knowledge about AATD, in particular among general practitioners, access to AATD specialised centres and access to reliable, easy to understand information about living with AATD. Regarding barriers to treatment, participants from countries where augmentation therapy was reimbursed prioritised improving knowledge in AATD, while respondents in non-reimbursed countries regarded access to AATD augmentation therapy and to specialised centres as the most relevant. The main research and management priorities identified by healthcare providers and patients included understanding the natural history of AATD, improving information to physicians, improving access to specialised reference centres, personalising treatment and having equal opportunities for access to existing therapies."

Our aim was to develop models of etiological diagnosis and unfavourable prognosis which may support a rationale diagnostic approach. We retrospectively analysed 154 patients born between January 1985 and October 2019. The cohort was divided into two main groups: (A) transient cholestasis and (B) other diagnosis (with subgroups) and also in two groups of outcomes: (I) unfavourable and (II) favourable. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified the lower gestational age as the only variable independently associated with an increased risk of transient cholestasis and signs and/or symptoms of sepsis with infectious or metabolic diseases. Gamma-glutamyl transferase serum levels > 300 IU/L had a positive predictive value for both diagnosis of biliary atresia and for alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency (A1ATD) and for unfavourable prognosis. A model of diagnosis for A1ATD (n = 34) showed an area under the ROC curve = 0.843 [confidence interval (CI): 0.773-0.912].Conclusion: This study identified some predictors of diagnosis and prognosis which helped to build a diagnostic decision algorithm. The unusually large subgroup of patients with A1ATD in this cohort emphasizes its predictive diagnostic model. What Is Known • The etiological diagnosis of neonatal cholestasis (NC) requires a step-by-step guided approach, and diagnostic models have been developed only for biliary atresia. • Current algorithms neither address the epidemiology changes nor the application of the new molecular diagnostic tools. What Is New • This study provides diagnostic predictive models for patients with A1ATD, metabolic/infectious diseases, and transient cholestasis, and two models of unfavourable prognosis for NC. • A diagnostic decision algorithm is proposed based on this study, authors expertise and the literature."

    "abstract": "This review summarizes the current research and outlooks regarding the obstacles to diagnosing and treating early alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency (AATD). It draws on prior systematic reviews and expert surveys to discover precisely what difficulties exist in early diagnosis and treatment of AATD and elucidate potential solutions to ease these difficulties. The perceived rarity of AATD may translate to a condition poorly understood by primary care physicians, and even many respiratory physicians, which results in opportunities for diagnosis being missed, especially in mild or asymptomatic patients. There are diagnostic techniques involving biomarkers and home testing methods which could improve the rate of early diagnosis. With respect to treatment, AATD involves treating two separate pathologies, lung disease and liver disease. The only specific AATD treatment, augmentation therapy, has proven ability in treating lung disease but not liver disease. Alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT) synthesized in the liver can form damaging polymers that also result in reduced circulating AAT levels and, whilst liver transplantation is used to effectively treat AATD, it is inappropriate in early disease. Novel therapeutic areas such as gene editing and increasing autophagy are therefore being researched as future treatments. Ultimately, diagnosis and treatment are intrinsically linked in AATD, with earlier diagnosis leading to better treatment options and thus better patient outcomes."

    "abstract": "Many drugs have been approved for clinical trials for the treatment of COVID-19 disease, focusing on either antiviral or anti-inflammatory approaches. Combining antiviral and anti-inflammatory drugs or therapies together may be more effective. Human alpha-1 antitrypsin (A1AT) is a blood circulating glycoprotein that is best known as a protease inhibitor. It has been used to treat emphysema patients with A1AT deficiency for decades. We and others have demonstrated its role in reducing acute lung injury by inhibiting inflammation, cell death, coagulation, and neutrophil elastase activation. Recently, A1AT has been found to inhibit severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection by inhibiting transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), a protease involved in the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into host cells. This dual role of both antiviral infection and anti-inflammation makes A1AT a unique and excellent candidate for COVID-19 treatment. Three clinical trials of A1AT for COVID-19 treatment have recently been approved in several countries. It is important to determine whether A1AT can prevent the progress from moderate to severe lung injury and eventually to be used to treat COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome."

    "abstract": "Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is one of the most common hereditary disorders occurring in populations of European origin and is due to variants in SERPINA1, which encodes a protease inhibitor of neutrophil elastase, limiting lung damage from this enzyme. The World Health Organization has recommended that individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma be tested for AATD. The development of inexpensive and simple genetic testing will help to meet this goal. Primers and synthetic SERPINA1 gene fragments (gBlocks) were designed for 5 AATD-associated variants. PCR was run on a CFX96 Thermal Cycler with High Resolution Melting (HRM) capacity and data analyzed using the supplied HRM-analysis software. Genomic DNA from individuals (n = 86) genotyped for the S and Z variants were used for validation. HRM-analysis was performed on 3 additional samples with low alpha-1-antitrypsin levels inconsistent with the genotype determined in our clinical laboratory. Unique normalized melt curve and difference curve patterns were identified for the AAT variants Z, S, I, F, and MMalton using gBlocks. Similar curve shapes were seen when these primers were used to analyze the gDNA samples. HRM identified the genotypes of the gDNA correctly with 100% concordance. The curve shapes of some samples did not match the melting patterns of the targeted variant. Sequencing was used to identify the variants, including rare AATD variants c.1108_1115delinsAAAAACA (p.Glu370Lysfs*31) and c.1130dup (p.Leu377fs). We developed a rapid and inexpensive HRM-analysis method for genotyping of Z, S, MMalton, I, and F variants that was also capable of detecting other variants."

    "title": "Alpha 1 Antitrypsin-Deficient Macrophages Have Impaired Efferocytosis of Apoptotic Neutrophils.",
    "abstract": "Alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is an autosomal co-dominant disorder characterized by a low level of circulating AAT, which significantly reduces protection for the lower airways against proteolytic burden caused by neutrophils. Neutrophils, which are terminally differentiated innate immune cells and play a critical role to clear pathogens, accumulate excessively in the lung of AATD individuals. The neutrophil burden in AATD individuals increases the risk for early-onset destructive lung diseases by producing neutrophil products such as reactive oxygen radicals and various proteases. The level of AAT in AATD individuals is not sufficient to inhibit the activity of neutrophil chemotactic factors such as CXCL-8 and LTB4, which could lead to alveolar neutrophil accumulation in AATD individuals. However, as neutrophils have a short lifespan, and apoptotic neutrophils are rapidly cleared by alveolar macrophages that outnumber the apoptotic neutrophils in the pulmonary alveolus, the increased chemotaxis activity does not fully explain the persistent neutrophil accumulation and the resulting chronic inflammation in AATD individuals. Here, we propose that the ability of alveolar macrophages to clear apoptotic neutrophils is impaired in AATD individuals and it could be the main driver to cause neutrophil accumulation in their lung. This study demonstrates that Z-AAT variant significantly increases the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines including CXCL-8, CXCL1, LTB4, and TNFα in LPS-treated macrophages. These cytokines play a central role in neutrophil recruitment to the lung and in clearance of apoptotic neutrophils by macrophages. Our result shows that LPS treatment significantly reduces the efferocytosis ability of macrophages with the Z-AAT allele by inducing TNFα expression. We incubated monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) with apoptotic neutrophils and found that after 3 h of co-incubation, the expression level of CXCL-8 is reduced in M-MDMs but increased in Z-MDMs. This result shows that the expression of inflammatory cytokines could be increased by impaired efferocytosis. It indicates that the efferocytosis ability of macrophages plays an important role in regulating cytokine expression and resolving inflammation. Findings from this study would help us better understand the multifaceted effect of AAT on regulating neutrophil balance in the lung and the underlying mechanisms."

    "abstract": "Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (AATD) is a rare genetic condition that predisposes patients to lung and liver disease and is often underdiagnosed due to incomplete diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma. Improvements in physician awareness have been made, but better strategies for both diagnosis and management are still required. The only current disease-modifying therapy for AATD is the infusion of the missing Alpha-1 Antitrypsin (AAT) protein, which can slow progression of emphysema. However, AAT treatment can impact patient freedom and quality of life due to the need for weekly intravenous infusions. A symposium was held to discuss patient-centric aspects of care that have impact on the lives of patients with AATD, including exacerbations of their lung disease, self-administration of intravenous AAT therapy and pulmonary rehabilitation. Intravenous self-infusion of drugs is an established treatment strategy for patients with a variety of conditions and can improve patient quality of life, freedom and mental well-being. Experience from these areas show that patients typically manage their treatment well and without complications. When applied to AATD, training patients to self-infuse therapy can be successful, but formal guidelines would be beneficial. In addition to pharmacological intervention, individualized pulmonary rehabilitation, exercise and educational programs can encourage health-enhancing patient behavior and further improve patient quality of life. However, differences in skeletal muscle adaptations to pulmonary rehabilitation exercise regimens have been observed between patients with AATD and non-AATD COPD, highlighting the need to develop training programs specifically designed for patients with AATD."

Liver disease can develop asymptomatically, and non-invasive markers of fibrosis may help identify patients who require definitive assessment with liver biopsy. We evaluated the utility of non-invasive markers of liver fibrosis in A1ATD to guide testing in settings without ready access to hepatology expertise. Patients attending the London A1ATD service undergo assessment using blood tests to calculate the 'APRI' and 'FIB-4' score, liver ultrasound and Fibroscan. Liver biopsy is offered to patients who have abnormal liver function tests with abnormal liver ultrasound and/or liver stiffness >6 kPa on Fibroscan. Liver biopsies were assessed for the presence of A1AT, steatosis, fibrosis and inflammation. 75 patients with A1ATD had results for analysis, 56% were female, age 16-82 years. 75% of patients had Fibroscan <6 kPa, 19% had Fibroscan 6-7.9 kPa and 6%>8 kPa. There was a significant correlation between FIB-4 and Fibroscan (r=0.244, p=0.035). Fibroscan >6 kPa corresponded to a FIB-4 score of >1.26. However, FIB-4 >1.26 had poor sensitivity (47%), specificity (32%) and positive-predictive value (PPV; 36%) to identify Fibroscan >6 kPa. The negative-predictive value (NPV) was stronger at 81%. APRI data were similar. Twelve patients underwent liver biopsy, with 11 reports available for analysis. Six had FIB-4 scores<1.26 and five had Fibroscan of <6 kPa. A1AT was present in 64% of biopsies, steatosis in 82%, mild fibrosis in 36%, moderate fibrosis in 9% and severe fibrosis in 9%. A combination of liver ultrasound and non-invasive fibrosis tests can help identify patients with A1ATD liver injury. However, APRI and FIB-4 scores alone had poor sensitivity and specificity to justify use as an independent tool for liver pathology in A1ATD."

    "abstract": "Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a genetic condition characterised by low circulating levels of alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT), a serine proteinase inhibitor. The most common deficiency variants are the S and Z mutations, which cause the accumulation of misfolded AAT in hepatocytes resulting in endoplasmic reticular stress and insufficient release of AAT into the circulation (<11μmol/L). This leads to liver disease, as well as an increased risk of emphysema due to unopposed proteolytic activity of neutrophil-derived serine proteinases in the lungs. AATD has been traditionally viewed as an inflammatory disorder caused directly by a proteinase-antiproteinase imbalance in the lung, but increasing evidence suggests that low AAT levels may affect other cellular functions. Recently, AAT polymers have been identified in both monocytes and macrophages from AATD patients and evidence is building that these cells may also play a role in the development of AATD lung disease. Alveolar macrophages are phagocytic cells that are important in the lung immune response but are also implicated in driving inflammation. This review explores the potential implications of monocyte and macrophage involvement in non-liver AAT synthesis and the pathophysiology of AATD lung disease."

This misfolding occurs via a transiently populated intermediate state, but our structural understanding of this process is limited by the instability of recombinant α<sub>1</sub>-antitrypsin variants in solution. Here we apply NMR spectroscopy to patient-derived samples of α<sub>1</sub>-antitrypsin at natural isotopic abundance to investigate the consequences of disease-causing mutations, and observe widespread chemical shift perturbations for methyl groups in Z AAT (E342K). By comparison with perturbations induced by binding of a small-molecule inhibitor of misfolding we conclude that they arise from rapid exchange between the native conformation and a well-populated intermediate state. The observation that this intermediate is stabilised by inhibitor binding suggests a paradoxical approach to the targeted treatment of protein misfolding disorders, wherein the stabilisation of disease-associated states provides selectivity while inhibiting further transitions along misfolding pathways."

    "abstract": "The genetic disorder alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) results in reduced levels of alpha 1 antitrypsin (AAT) in the lung and an imbalance between AAT anti-protease activity and the activity of proteases that degrade elastin and connective tissues. This imbalance commonly leads to the excessive proteolysis of structural tissue of the alveoli, causing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)/emphysema. While patients with AATD are encouraged to make lifestyle changes, including stopping smoking, and can be treated with alpha 1 antitrypsin therapy (AAT therapy) to slow progression of COPD/emphysema, damage to the lungs is irreparable, and therefore, lung transplantation is required in severe cases. However, following lung transplant, the genetic cause of AATD-related COPD/emphysema remains, and patients may continue to be at risk of redeveloping COPD/emphysema. Recurrence of COPD/emphysema was observed in a patient with AATD 2 years after initial successful lung transplantation and cessation of AAT therapy who recommenced smoking after no signs of disease at the 1-year assessment. This case demonstrates that smoking cessation is critical in patients with AATD, even after lung transplant, and it highlights that patients with AATD may benefit from AAT therapy post-lung transplant."

The complete mechanisms via which AATD causes lung disease are not fully understood. To improve our understanding of the pathogenesis of AATD, we investigated gene expression profiles of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in AATD individuals. We performed RNA-Seq on RNA extracted from matched BAL and PBMC samples isolated from 89 subjects enrolled in the Genomic Research in Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency and Sarcoidosis (GRADS) study. Subjects were stratified by genotype and augmentation therapy. Supervised and unsupervised differential gene expression analyses were performed using Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) to identify gene profiles associated with subjects' clinical variables. The genes in the most significant WGCNA module were used to cluster AATD individuals. Gene validation was performed by NanoString nCounter Gene Expression Assay. We observed modest effects of AATD genotype and augmentation therapy on gene expression. When WGCNA was applied to BAL transcriptome, one gene module, ME31 (2312 genes), correlated with the highest number of clinical variables and was functionally enriched with numerous immune T-lymphocyte related pathways. This gene module identified two distinct clusters of AATD individuals with different disease severity and distinct PBMC gene expression patterns. We successfully identified novel clusters of AATD individuals where severity correlated with increased immune response independent of individuals' genotype and augmentation therapy. These findings may suggest the presence of previously unrecognised disease endotypes in AATD that associate with T-lymphocyte immunity and disease severity."

    "abstract": "The extent of the survival benefit of augmentation therapy for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) in individuals with advanced COPD is difficult to define. We performed a retrospective analysis using all available data from the observational registry of individuals with severe deficiency of alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) conducted by the NHLBI investigators. Individuals (N=1129) with severe deficiency of AAT were evaluated for mortality using all data sources and stratified by 10% increments of baseline forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) percent predicted and by augmentation therapy status (ever receiving versus never receiving). Kaplan-Meier survival curves were constructed for each of the deciles comparing survival in treated vs non-treated groups. A multivariable model was performed to define the correlates of survival in individuals with FEV1 <30% predicted. Amongst all subjects, augmentation was associated with improved survival (p<0.0001). Among the individuals ever receiving augmentation therapy, survival was better than for those not receiving augmentation at all 10% increments of FEV1% predicted from 10% to 60% (P values <0.05 in all deciles). In subgroups of participants with hyperinflation defined as residual volume (RV)>120% predicted and in subgroups of participants with reduced diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) <70% predicted, there was significantly better survival for those ever receiving augmentation therapy than for those who never received augmentation (p<0.001). A multivariable analysis showed that mortality benefit is influenced by age, DLCO % predicted, and augmentation therapy. There is a survival benefit from augmentation therapy in AATD between FEV1 values in the 10-60% predicted range. Screening and treatment of AATD patients should therefore not be limited by the severity of illness as defined by FEV1."

AATD is one of the most common and underrecognized autosomal disorders associated with an increased risk of developing liver and lung diseases. An association between α1-antitrypsin and asthma has been suggested, especially with severe forms of this disease. Many studies have shown an increased prevalence of asthma in the α1-antitrypsin-deficient population overtime (4-38%). The biological mechanism underlying these two conditions and able to bind them has not yet been well investigated. As α1-antitrypsin is the main inhibitor of the serine proteinase and it is an important anti-inflammatory protein with pronounced immunomodulatory activities, it can be hypothesized that the link between AATD and asthma might be represented by the elastase/antielastase imbalance and the proinflammatory effect that occurs because of the reduction of this protein. There is a strong need for further researches to better understand the molecular mechanisms binding AATD and asthma. It is also recommendable to screen for AATD, late-onset asthma patients, and/or those with not fully reversible airways obstruction."

It also represents an opportunity to rid the cell of superfluous and damaged organelles, misfolded proteins or invaded microorganisms. Liver autophagy contributes to basic hepatic functions such as lipid, glycogen and protein turnover. Deregulated hepatic autophagy has been linked to many liver diseases including alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, alcoholic and non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases, hepatitis B and C infections, liver fibrosis as well as liver cancer. Recently, bile acids and the bile acid receptor FXR have been implicated in the regulation of hepatic autophagy, which implies a role of autophagy also for cholestatic liver diseases. This review summarizes the current evidence of bile acid mediated effects on autophagy and how this affects cholestatic liver diseases. Although detailed studies are lacking, we suggest a concept that the activity of autophagy in cholestasis depends on the disease stage, where autophagy may be induced at early stages (\"cholestophagy\") but may be impaired in prolonged cholestatic states (\"cholestopagy\")."

    "title": "Hypothesis: Alpha-1-antitrypsin is a promising treatment option for COVID-19.",
    "abstract": "No definitive treatment for COVID-19 exists although promising results have been reported with remdesivir and glucocorticoids. Short of a truly effective preventive or curative vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, it is becoming increasingly clear that multiple pathophysiologic processes seen with COVID-19 as well as SARS-CoV-2 itself should be targeted. Because alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT) embraces a panoply of biologic activities that may antagonize several pathophysiologic mechanisms induced by SARS-CoV-2, we hypothesize that this naturally occurring molecule is a promising agent to ameliorate COVID-19. We posit at least seven different mechanisms by which AAT may alleviate COVID-19. First, AAT is a serine protease inhibitor (SERPIN) shown to inhibit TMPRSS-2, the host serine protease that cleaves the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, a necessary preparatory step for the virus to bind its cell surface receptor ACE2 to gain intracellular entry. Second, AAT has anti-viral activity against other RNA viruses HIV and influenza as well as induces autophagy, a known host effector mechanism against MERS-CoV, a related coronavirus that causes the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome. Third, AAT has potent anti-inflammatory properties, in part through inhibiting both nuclear factor-kappa B (NFκB) activation and ADAM17 (also known as tumor necrosis factor-alpha converting enzyme), and thus may dampen the hyper-inflammatory response of COVID-19. Fourth, AAT inhibits neutrophil elastase, a serine protease that helps recruit potentially injurious neutrophils and implicated in acute lung injury. AAT inhibition of ADAM17 also prevents shedding of ACE2 and hence may preserve ACE2 inhibition of bradykinin, reducing the ability of bradykinin to cause a capillary leak in COVID-19. Fifth, AAT inhibits thrombin, and venous thromboembolism and in situ microthrombi and macrothrombi are increasingly implicated in COVID-19. Sixth, AAT inhibition of elastase can antagonize the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), a complex extracellular structure comprised of neutrophil-derived DNA, histones, and proteases, and implicated in the immunothrombosis of COVID-19; indeed, AAT has been shown to change the shape and adherence of non-COVID-19-related NETs. Seventh, AAT inhibition of endothelial cell apoptosis may limit the endothelial injury linked to severe COVID-19-associated acute lung injury, multi-organ dysfunction, and pre-eclampsia-like syndrome seen in gravid women. Furthermore, because both NETs formation and the presence of anti-phospholipid antibodies are increased in both COVID-19 and non-COVID pre-eclampsia, it suggests a similar vascular pathogenesis in both disorders. As a final point, AAT has an excellent safety profile when administered to patients with AAT deficiency and is dosed intravenously once weekly but also comes in an inhaled preparation. Thus, AAT is an appealing drug candidate to treat COVID-19 and should be studied."

Functional defects in cystic fibrosis, primary ciliary dyskinesias, alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, and surfactant proteins caused by gene mutations may result in progressive pulmonary disease. This article provides an overview of pediatric pulmonary disease from a genetic perspective."

    "abstract": "Combined liver and kidney transplantation (CLKT) is indicated in patients with failure of both organs, or for the treatment of end-stage chronic kidney disease (ESKD) caused by a genetic defect in the liver. The aim of the present review is to provide the most up-to-date overview of the rare conditions as indications for CLKT. They are major indications for CLKT in children. However, in some of them (<i>e.g.,</i> atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome or primary hyperoxaluria), CLKT may be required in adults as well. Primary hyperoxaluria is divided into three types, of which type 1 and 2 lead to ESKD. CLKT has been proven effective in renal function replacement, at the same time preventing recurrence of the disease. Nephronophthisis is associated with liver fibrosis in 5% of cases and these patients are candidates for CLKT. In alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency, hereditary C3 deficiency, lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase deficiency and glycogen storage diseases, glomerular or tubulointerstitial disease can lead to chronic kidney disease. Liver transplantation as a part of CLKT corrects underlying genetic and consequent metabolic abnormality. In atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome caused by mutations in the genes for factor H, successful CLKT has been reported in a small number of patients. However, for this indication, CLKT has been largely replaced by eculizumab, an anti-C5 antibody. CLKT has been well established to provide immune protection of the transplanted kidney against donor-specific antibodies against class I HLA, facilitating transplantation in a highly sensitized recipient."

    "title": "Liver disease in the older child.",
    "abstract": "Liver disease in children tends to present either as: (i) an acute hepatitis with or without jaundice; (ii) incidental finding of abnormal liver function tests; or (iii) from a complication of portal hypertension with either haematemesis and/or incidental splenomegaly. Acute hepatitis may result from acute infection, prescribed or other drugs, ischaemia or vascular causes, autoimmune hepatitis, or idiopathic liver failure. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is now the most likely reason for abnormal liver function tests but medications, metabolic disease, cholangiopathy and non-liver causes should be considered. Autoimmune hepatitis and alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency are the most likely causes of insidious liver disease. An international normalised ratio uncorrected by vitamin K reflects the severity of liver synthetic dysfunction, but not propensity to bleed. Creatine kinase helps to differentiate muscle from liver disease in patients with raised transaminases. Doppler ultrasound of hepatic vasculature is useful when assessing splenomegaly to differentiate extra-hepatic portal hypertension from inherent liver disease."

    "title": "Altered phenotype in LMAN1-deficient mice with low levels of residual LMAN1 expression.",
    "abstract": "Combined deficiency of coagulation factors V and VIII (F5F8D) is an autosomal recessive bleeding disorder caused by loss-of-function mutations in either LMAN1 or MCFD2. The latter genes encode 2 components of a mammalian cargo receptor that facilitates secretion of coagulation factor V (FV) and factor VIII (FVIII) from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi via coat protein complex II vesicles. F5F8D patients exhibit FV and FVIII levels that are ∼10% to 15% of normal. We report herein a comparative analysis for a series of murine Lman1 alleles. Consistent with previous reports, mice completely deficient in LMAN1 (Lman1-/-) exhibit ∼50% FV and FVIII levels. In contrast, mice carrying a hypomorphic Lman1 allele (Lman1cgt/cgt) that expresses ∼6% to 8% of wild-type Lman1 mRNA levels exhibit intermediate plasma FV and FVIII reductions (∼70% of wild-type levels). Lman1-/- mice exhibit ER accumulation of another LMAN1 cargo, alpha-1 antitrypsin (A1AT), with an intermediate level of A1AT ER retention observed in Lman1cgt/cgt mice. Finally, the previously reported strain-specific, partially penetrant, perinatal lethality of LMAN1-deficient mice (Lman1gt1/gt1) was confirmed in Lman1-/- mice, although it was not observed in Lman1cgt/cgt mice. Taken together, these results show a dose-dependent effect of residual LMAN1 on the secretion of its cargo proteins. The results also suggest that human subjects with hypomorphic LMAN1 mutations might present with mild bleeding phenotypes resulting from more modest reductions in FV and FVIII, which could be missed by routine clinical evaluation. Finally, these findings suggest that therapeutic targeting of LMAN1 to reduce FV and FVIII as an anticoagulant strategy may only require partial inhibition of LMAN1 function."

    "title": "The Distribution of Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Genotypes Between Patients with COPD/Emphysema, Asthma and Bronchiectasis.",
    "abstract": "Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a rare hereditary condition characterized by low circulating levels of alpha-1antitrypsin (AAT). While the association between AATD and COPD/emphysema is undisputed, the association between AATD and asthma or bronchiectasis is still a matter of debate. Our study aimed to investigate the distribution of AAT genotypes between patients with COPD/emphysema, asthma and bronchiectasis. To back up the diagnostic labels, we described symptoms associated with the diagnosis. Between September 2003 and March 2020, 29,465 testing kits (AlphaKit®) were analyzed in the AAT laboratory, University of Marburg, Germany. The diagnosis of AATD has been made based on the measurements of AAT serum levels, followed by genotyping, phenotyping or whole gene sequencing depending on the availability and/or the need for more detailed interpretation of the results. The respiratory symptoms were recorded as well. Regarding the distribution of the wild type allele M and the most frequent mutations S (E264V) and Z (E342K), no significant differences could be found between COPD/emphysema [Pi*MM (58.24%); Pi*SZ (2.49%); Pi*ZZ (9.12%)] and bronchiectasis [Pi*MM (59.30%) Pi*SZ (2.81%); Pi*ZZ (7.02%)]. When COPD/emphysema and bronchiectasis were recorded in the same patient, the rate of Pi* ZZ (14.78%) mutations was even higher. Asthma patients exhibited significantly less deficient genotypes [Pi*MM (54.81%); Pi*SZ (2%); Pi*ZZ (2.77%)] than two other groups. Associated respiratory symptoms confirmed the diagnosis. COPD/emphysema and bronchiectasis, but not asthma patients, exhibit higher frequency of AATD genotypes. Our data suggest that AATD testing should be offered to patients with COPD/emphysema and bronchiectasis."

    "abstract": "Beyond smoking, several risk factors for the development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have been described, among which socioeconomic status including education is of particular interest. We studied the contribution of education to lung function and symptoms relative to smoking in a group of never-smokers with COPD compared to a group of long-time ex-smokers with COPD. We used baseline data of the COSYCONET cohort, including patients of GOLD grades 1-4 who were either never-smokers (n=150, age 68.5y, 53.3% female) or ex-smokers (≥10 packyears) for at least 10 years (n=616, 68.3y, 29.9% female). Socioeconomic status was analyzed using education level and mortality was assessed over a follow-up period of 4.5 years. Analyses were performed using ANOVA and regression models. Spirometric lung function did not differ between groups, whereas CO diffusing capacity and indicators of lung hyperinflation/air-trapping showed better values in the never-smoker group. In both groups, spirometric lung function depended on the education level, with better values for higher education. Quality of life and 6-MWD were significantly different in never-smokers as well as patients with higher education. Asthma, alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, and bronchiectasis were more often reported in never-smokers, and asthma was more often reported in patients with higher education. Higher education was also associated with reduced mortality (hazard ratio 0.46; 95% CI 0.22-0.98). Overall, in the COSYCONET COPD cohort, differences in functional status between never-smokers and long-time ex-smokers were not large. Compared to that, the dependence on education level was more prominent, with higher education associated with better outcomes, including mortality. These data indicate that non-smoking COPD patients' socioeconomic factors are relevant and should be taken into account by clinicians."

    "abstract": "Elastographic measurement of liver stiffness is of growing importance in the assessment of liver disease. Pediatric experiences with this technique are primarily single center and limited in scope. The Childhood Liver Disease Research Network provided a unique opportunity to assess elastography in a well-characterized multi-institutional cohort. Children with biliary atresia (BA), alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (A1ATD), or Alagille syndrome (ALGS) followed in a prospective longitudinal network study were eligible for enrollment in a prospective investigation of transient elastography (FibroScan). Studies were performed in participants who were nonfasted and nonsedated. Liver stiffness measurements (LSMs) were correlated with standard clinical and biochemical parameters of liver disease along with a research definition of clinically evident portal hypertension (CEPH) graded as absent, possible, or definite. Between November 2016 and August 2019, 550 participants with a mean age of 8.8 years were enrolled, 458 of whom had valid LSMs (BA, n = 254; A1ATD, n = 104; ALGS, n = 100). Invalid scans were more common in participants <2 years old. There was a positive correlation between LSM and total bilirubin, international normalized ratio (INR), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), GGT to platelet ratio (GPR), pediatric end-stage liver disease score, AST to platelet ratio index, and spleen size, and a negative correlation with albumin and platelet count in BA, with similar correlations for A1ATD (except AST, ALT, and albumin) and ALGS (except for INR, GGT, GPR, and ALT). Possible or definite CEPH was more common in BA compared to ALGS and A1ATD. LSM was greater in definite versus absent CEPH in all three diseases. Disease-specific clinical and biochemical characteristics of the different CEPH grades were observed. <i>Conclusion</i>: It is feasible to obtain LSMs in children, especially over the age of 2 years. LSM correlates with liver parameters and portal hypertension, although disease-specific patterns exist."

    "abstract": "Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is caused by genetic variants in the <i>SERPINA1</i> gene conferring risk of developing emphysema. The clinical expression of AATD-related emphysema mostly occurs in carriers of 2 deficient alleles. By DNA sequencing of <i>SERPINA1</i>, numerous rare variants have been identified. Clarifying whether 2 mutations observed in 1 patient are on the same or distinct alleles has obvious clinical implications. We studied 7 carriers of a rare variant, Leu353Phe_fsTer24, known to lead to undetectable serum levels of AAT. Two of them were also carriers of the S or Z allele. We developed an allele-specific DNA sequencing method to characterize the allelic background of the Leu353Phe_fsTer24 variant. The Leu353Phe_fsTer24 variant was transmitted on the same allele as the M3 variant (E376D) in all patients. This mutation is thus named Q0<sub>Ourém</sub> on the conventional PI system. We demonstrated that individuals harboring the E264V (S) and E342K (Z) mutations had them on distinct alleles from Q0<sub>Ourém</sub> and are, thus, compound heterozygotes. The 7 Q0<sub>Ourém</sub> carriers had AAT levels ranging from 0.18g/l to 0.82g/l. The lowest AAT serum levels were observed in compound heterozygotes (S/Q0<sub>Ourém</sub> and Z/Q0<sub>Ourém</sub>) suggesting higher risk of developing emphysema. For the 7 patients, Leu353Phe_fsTer24 is transmitted on the M3 background and they are, thus, carriers of the Q0<sub>Ourém</sub> allele. Allele-specific DNA sequencing was useful to distinguish 1 or 2 deficient alleles in carriers of 2 mutations. In rare cases, this method is important to understand the clinical significance of genetic variants found in <i>SERPINA1</i>."

Several studies have examined its possible association with an increased risk of lung cancer. Systematic review of the scientific literature on studies analyzing the risk of LC associated with AATD, as well as its impact on the histological type and survival. The information was located in the Medline (PubMed), Cochrane, and EMBASE databases. Six studies including a total of 4 038 patients with LC met the inclusion criteria. Most studies included seem to indicate that AATD increases the risk of developing LC, particularly of the squamous and adenocarcinoma types. This risk increases with exposure to tobacco smoke and the diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Only one study analyzed the survival of LC patients without finding differences between AATD and non-AATD patients. These results suggest that AATD may increase the risk of developing LC, particularly of the squamous and adenocarcinoma histological types, but no impact on patient survival has been demonstrated. However, the low quality of the included studies makes it necessary to carry out more studies with a larger sample size and preferably of a prospective nature to confirm these results."

The SFS is a randomized trial of an intensive distance intervention that was delivered via a series of mailings and teleconferences versus no additional intervention. All participants (n=500) were also enrolled in a disease management program designed for individuals with AATD-associated lung disease who have been prescribed augmentation therapy. The primary outcome was self-reported number of exercise minutes per week. The secondary outcome was BMI. Linear mixed model analyses were used to assess the difference in average weekly exercise minutes between the intervention arms over time. T-tests, signed rank and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used to evaluate changes in BMI between the intervention arms and within each BMI category. The study included 429 individuals with evaluable primary outcome data.There was a significant effect of intervention on exercise minutes over time <i>(p</i>=0.018). Participants in the intervention group reported an average of 167.14 minutes (standard deviation [SD]=10.68) of weekly exercise and those in the standard care group reported 148.31 minutes (SD=10.96). There was a significant difference in BMI change between the intervention (mean BMI decrease 0.74, SD=2.16) and the standard care group (mean BMI decrease 0.27, SD=1.63); <i>p</i>=0.0122.

We analysed the number of AAT determinations performed and described the characteristics of the individuals tested, as well as the medical specialties and the reasons for requesting AAT determination. A total of 3507 determinations were performed, of which 5.5% corresponded to children. A significant increase in the number of AAT determinations was observed from 349 in 2015 to 872 in 2019. Among the samples, 57.6% carried an intermediate AATD (50-119 mg/dL) and 2.4% severe deficiency (<50 mg/dL). The most frequent phenotype in severe AATD individuals was PI*ZZ (78.5%), and aminotransferase levels were above normal in around 43% of children and 30% of adults. Respiratory specialists requested the highest number of AAT determinations (31.5%) followed by digestive diseases and internal medicine (27.5%) and primary care physicians (19.7%). The main reason for AAT determination in severe AATD adults was chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (41.7%), but reasons for requesting AAT determination were not reported in up to 41.7% of adults and 58.3% of children. There is an increase in the frequency of AATD testing despite the rate of AAT determination remaining low. Awareness about AAT is probably increasing, but the reason for testing is not always clear."

While clinical practice guidelines provide recommendations on patients who should be tested, more refined algorithms are needed to identify COPD patients who are likely candidates for AATD testing and to prevent delays in diagnosis and treatment. The objective of this study was to identify comorbid associations with AATD among patients diagnosed with COPD in the United States. Using data from the 2012-2017 PharMetrics Plus Administrative Claims Database and 2011-2014 Medicare Fee for Service 5% Sample, patients with COPD (ICD-9-CM: 491.xx, 492.xx, or 496, ICD-10-CM J41, J42, J43, J44) and AATD (ICD-9-CM: 273.4, ICD-10-CM: E88.01) were identified. Patient demographic and diagnostic characteristics were assessed. Logistic regression models were developed to identify significant predictors of AATD. A cohort of 344,528 Medicare beneficiaries with COPD (of which 302 (0.09%) also had two diagnoses of AATD) and a cohort of 340,259 commercially insured patients with COPD (of which 1076 (0.3%) also had a diagnosis of AATD) were constructed. Associations with AATD identified in both models included ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes for chronic pulmonary heart disease, chronic liver disease and cirrhosis, and liver transplant. Significant associations with a diagnosis of AATD among patients with COPD were consistently represented in each of the datasets evaluated, which suggests meaningful comorbidity implications in AATD patients. These findings reinforce the need to test individuals with COPD for AATD as early as possible to help reduce the development of associated comorbid conditions."

Laboratory testing plays a vital role in AATD, with diagnosis requiring documentation of both a low AAT level and a mutated allele. This retrospective evaluation examines the efficacy of a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) (proteotyping)-based algorithm for AATD detection. A 16-month retrospective data analysis was performed on two cohorts: 5,474 samples tested with the proteotype-based algorithm and 16,147 samples directly tested by isoelectric focusing (IEF) phenotyping. LC-MS/MS reduced the rate of IEF testing by 97%. The 3% of cases reflexed to IEF resulted in 12 (0.2%) additional phenotype findings. Retrospectively applying the proteotype-based algorithm to the IEF cohort demonstrated a 99.9% sensitivity for the detection of deficiency-associated phenotypes. Most deficiency phenotypes missed by the proteotyping algorithm would come from heterozygous patients with an F, I, or P paired to an S or Z. In all of these cases, patient AAT levels were greater than 70 mg/dL, above the threshold for AAT augmentation therapy. The proteotype algorithm is a sensitive and cost-effective approach for the diagnosis of clinical AAT deficiency."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the small airways in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with a nitrogen washout test and to verify whether there is a difference between patients with COPD due to smoking and those with COPD due to alpha-1 antitrypsin mutation. Sixteen patients with mutation in the <i>SERPINA1</i> gene and 45 patients with no mutation were included in this cross-sectional study. All pulmonary function tests, including the single breath nitrogen washout test, were performed for all patients and alpha-1 antitrypsin dosage was assessed with immunonephelometry. A comparison of patients with COPD due to smoking and those with COPD due to smoking and mutation revealed a significant difference in closure volume (%), which was the poorest in the mutation group. In the group with COPD and mutation, there was an inverse correlation between smoking and closure volume (%). We also verified that similar to forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1), the phase III slope (%) and ΔN2 750-1250 mL (%) could be used to differentiate the severity of airflow limitation. Our results suggest that both variables, phase III slope and the ΔN2 750-1250 mL (%), could be related to COPD severity. Therefore, alterations at the distribution of the location of the emphysema could alter the results of closer volume and that the nitrogen washout test is more sensitive when compared to traditional pulmonary function test in evaluating COPD patients."

In vitro experiments have identified an intermediate conformational state (M*) that precedes polymer formation, but this has yet to be identified in vivo. Moreover, the mechanism of polymer formation and their fate in cells have been incompletely characterised. We have used cell models of disease in conjunction with conformation-selective monoclonal antibodies and a small molecule inhibitor of polymerisation to define the dynamics of polymer formation, accumulation and secretion. Pulse-chase experiments demonstrate that Z α<sub>1</sub> -antitrypsin accumulates as short-chain polymers that partition with soluble cellular components and are partially secreted by cells. These precede the formation of larger, insoluble polymers with a longer half-life (10.9 ± 1.7 h and 20.9 ± 7.4 h for soluble and insoluble polymers, respectively). The M* intermediate (or a by-product thereof) was identified in the cells by a conformation-specific monoclonal antibody. This was completely abrogated by treatment with the small molecule, which also blocked the formation of intracellular polymers. These data allow us to conclude that the M* conformation is central to polymerisation of Z α<sub>1</sub> -antitrypsin in vivo; preventing its accumulation represents a tractable approach for pharmacological treatment of this condition; polymers are partially secreted; and polymers exist as two distinct populations in cells whose different dynamics have likely consequences for the aetiology of the disease."

In most of the leptin-resistant obese subjects, A1AT deficiency develops which leads to a concurrent higher activity of NE. Obesity associated antiprotease-protease imbalance induces various lung complications, i.e. asthma, emphysema, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorders (COPD), cancer, etc. Past studies manifested that plant extracts/compounds reduce human NE activity. This knowledge will help in future to exploit phytochemicals as interventional therapeutic agents to decrease NE over-activity in susceptible obese individuals. Furthermore, the hypothesis discussed in this article will be helpful for researchers working in the fields of lung biology and obesity."

    "title": "Calreticulin enhances the secretory trafficking of a misfolded α-1-antitrypsin.",
    "abstract": "α1-antitrypsin (AAT) regulates the activity of multiple proteases in the lungs and liver. A mutant of AAT (E342K) called ATZ forms polymers that are present at only low levels in the serum and induce intracellular protein inclusions, causing lung emphysema and liver cirrhosis. An understanding of factors that can reduce the intracellular accumulation of ATZ is of great interest. We now show that calreticulin (CRT), an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) glycoprotein chaperone, promotes the secretory trafficking of ATZ, enhancing the media:cell ratio. This effect is more pronounced for ATZ than with AAT and is only partially dependent on the glycan-binding site of CRT, which is generally relevant to substrate recruitment and folding by CRT. The CRT-related chaperone calnexin does not enhance ATZ secretory trafficking, despite the higher cellular abundance of calnexin-ATZ complexes. CRT deficiency alters the distributions of ATZ-ER chaperone complexes, increasing ATZ-BiP binding and inclusion body formation and reducing ATZ interactions with components required for ER-Golgi trafficking, coincident with reduced levels of the protein transport protein Sec31A in CRT-deficient cells. These findings indicate a novel role for CRT in promoting the secretory trafficking of a protein that forms polymers and large intracellular inclusions. Inefficient secretory trafficking of ATZ in the absence of CRT is coincident with enhanced accumulation of ER-derived ATZ inclusion bodies. Further understanding of the factors that control the secretory trafficking of ATZ and their regulation by CRT could lead to new therapies for lung and liver diseases linked to AAT deficiency."

    "abstract": "Genetic screening is an advanced tool for reducing recessive disease burden. Nowadays, it is still unclear as to the number of genes or their variants that are necessary for effective screening. This paper describes the development of a carrier screening custom panel for cystic fibrosis, phenylketonuria, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, and sensorineural hearing loss consisting of 116 variants in the <i>CFTR</i>, <i>PAH</i>, <i>SERPINA1,</i> and <i>GJB2</i> genes. The approach is based on the cheapest and fastest method, on using a small number of genes, and on the estimation of the effectiveness of carriers' detection. The custom panel was tested on a population-based cohort that included 1244 participants. Genotypes were determined by the TaqMan OpenArray Genotyping platform on the QuantStudio 12K Flex Real-Time PCR System. The frequency of heterozygotes in the Russian population was 16.87% or 1:6 (CI95%: 14.76-19.00% by Clopper-Pearson exact method): in <i>CFTR</i>-2.81% (1:36), <i>PAH</i>-2.33% (1:43), <i>SERPINA1</i>-4.90% (1:20), and <i>GJB2</i>-6.83% (1:15). The data on allele frequencies were obtained for the first time on a Russian population. The panel allows us to identify the vast majority of carriers of recessive diseases in the population. It is an effective approach to carrier screening for common recessive diseases."

The objective of this study was to isolate the healthcare resource utilization and economic burden attributable to the presence of a genetic factor among COPD patients with and without Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (AATD), twelve months before and after their initial COPD diagnosis. Retrospective analysis of OptumLabs® Data Warehouse claims (OLDW; 2000-2017). The OLDW is a comprehensive, longitudinal real-world data asset with de-identified lives across claims and clinical information. AATD-associated COPD cases were matched with up to 10 unique non-AATD-associated COPD controls. Healthcare resource use and costs were assigned into the following categories: office (OV), outpatient (OP), and emergency room visits (ER), inpatients stays (IP), prescription drugs (RX), and other services (OTH). A generalized linear model was used to estimate total pre- and post-index (initial COPD diagnosis) costs from a third-party payer's perspective (2018 USD) controlling for confounders. Healthcare resource utilization was estimated using a negative binomial regression. The study population consisted of 8881 patients (953 cases matched with 7928 controls). The AATD-associated COPD cohort had higher expenditures and use of office visits (OV) and other (OTH) services, as well as OV, outpatient (OP), emergency room (ER), and prescription drugs (RX) before and after the index date, respectively. Adjusted total all-healthcare cost ratios for AATD-associated COPD patients as compared to controls were 2.04 [95% CI: 1.60-2.59] and 1.98 [95% CI: 1.55-2.52] while the incremental cost difference totaled $6861 [95% CI: $3025 - $10,698] and $5772 [95% CI: $1940 - $9604] per patient before and after the index date, respectively. Twelve months before and after their initial COPD diagnosis, patients with AATD incur higher healthcare utilization costs that are double the cost of similar COPD patients without AATD. This study also suggests that increased costs of AATD-associated COPD are not solely attributable to augmentation therapy use. Future studies should further explore the relationship between augmentation therapy, healthcare resource use, and other AATD-associated COPD expenditures."

According to the literature only sixty-seven out of seven hundred thirty-five asthmatic patients were submitted to genetic analysis to identify AATD and non-AATD subjects. Fifty-eight patients were studied. Clinical and functional data, including lung function, atopy and bronchial hyperactivity, were recorded.<b>Results</b>: The fifty-eight asthmatic patients were divided in AATD patients (<i>n</i> = 22) and non AATD patients (<i>n</i> = 36), according to genotype. The presence of atopy was significantly higher in patients with AATD than in those without AATD (91% vs. 64%; <i>p</i> = 0.031). AATD patients reported allergic manifestations more than non AATD patients (77% vs. 47%; <i>p</i> = 0.030).<b>Conclusion</b>: Our study shows that the presence of atopy in asthmatic patients with AATD is significantly higher than in asthmatic patients without gene mutation. In addition, a higher percentage of AATD patients self-reported allergic manifestations. No significant differences in respiratory symptoms, physical examination, disease severity or inflammation markers were found between AATD patients and non AATD patients."

    "abstract": "Infection rates, severity, and fatalities due to COVID-19, the pandemic mediated by SARS-CoV-2, vary greatly between countries. With few exceptions, these are lower in East and Southeast Asian and Sub-Saharan African countries compared with other regions. Epidemiological differences may reflect differences in border closures, lockdowns, and social distancing measures taken by each county, and by cultural differences, such as common use of face masks in East and Southeast Asian countries. The plasma serine protease inhibitor alpha-1 antitrypsin was suggested to protect from COVID-19 by inhibiting TMPRSS2, a cell surface serine protease essential for the SARS-CoV-2 cell entry. Here, we present evidence that population differences in alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency allele frequencies may partially explain national differences in the COVID-19 epidemiology. Our study compared reported national estimates for the major alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency alleles PiZ and PiS (SERPINA1 rs28929474 and rs17580, respectively) with the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center dataset. We found a significant positive correlation (R = .54, P = 1.98e-6) between the combined frequencies of the alpha-1 antitrypsin PiZ and PiS deficiency alleles in 67 countries and their reported COVID-19 mortality rates. Our observations suggest that alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency alleles may contribute to national differences in COVID-19 infection, severity, and mortality rates. Population-wide screening for carriers of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency alleles should be considered for prioritizing individuals for stricter social distancing measures and for receiving a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine once it becomes available."

Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have been used for the treatment of T1D in animal models and clinical trials. Based on the anti-inflammatory effects of alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT), we generated human AAT engineered MSCs (hAAT-MSCs) by infecting human bone marrow-derived MSCs with the pHAGE CMV-a1aT-UBC-GFP-W lentiviral vector. We compared the colony forming, differentiation, and migration capacity of empty virus-treated MSCs (hMSC) and hAAT-MSCs and tested their protective effects in the prevention of onset of T1D in nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice. hAAT-MSCs showed increased self-renewal, better migration and multilineage differentiation abilities compared to hMSCs. In addition, polymerase chain reaction array for 84 MSC-related genes showed that 23 genes were upregulated, and 3 genes were downregulated in hAAT-MSCs compared to hMSCs. Upregulated genes include those critical for the stemness (ie, Wnt family member 3A [WNT3A], kinase insert domain receptor [KDR]), migration (intercellular adhesion molecule 1 [ICAM-1], vascular cell adhesion protein 1 [VICAM-1], matrix metalloproteinase-2 [MMP2]), and survival (insulin-like growth factor 1 [IGF-1]) of MSCs. Pathway analysis showed that changed genes were related to growth factor activity, positive regulation of cell migration, and positive regulation of transcription. In vivo, a single intravenous infusion of hAAT-MSCs significantly limited inflammatory infiltration into islets and delayed diabetes onset in the NOD mice compared with those receiving vehicle or hMSCs. Taken together, overexpression of hAAT in MSCs improved intrinsic biological properties of MSCs needed for cellular therapy for the treatment of T1D."

The median survival time post-LT is 6.4 years (Interquartile range 5.6-6.8 years). The post-LT survival was significantly better in double LT compared to single LT (Median 7.7 vs 4.4 years, p < 0.001). Increasing age, presence of CMV mismatch, reintubation prior to discharge, and requiring treatment for rejection within one year of transplantation did impact post-LT mortality. The median survival after LT in AATD is 6.4 years and is similar to other lung diseases. When compared to usual COPD LT, AATD patients have increased post-LT mortality due to infections and liver disease.

Through this case study, we present some challenges and limitations of a BIA of managing patients affected with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD). We explored a conceptual basis and barriers for health services researchers interested in quantifying budget impacts of rare disease management program (DMP). We developed a static budget impact cost calculator model in Microsoft Excel, obtaining the clinical impact of a DMP from the literature and translating it into costs using OLDW. Cost inputs and resource use was obtained from 2010 to 2015 claims data using the OLDW. Insurers' payments were calculated and categorized into the following cost buckets: physician visits, emergency room visits, inpatients stays, augmentation therapy, other prescription drugs costs, and other costs. Data were based on 6832 patients with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency identified among over 21 million OLDW enrollees observed between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2015. The introduction of a DMP was estimated to decrease costs of the management of patients with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency by $13.5 million over 5 years. The savings attributed to the program over the 5-year time horizon are due to 2555 exacerbations, 5180 emergency room visits, 9342 specialist visits, and 105 358 general practitioner visits avoided. A comprehensive DMP for a rare condition might provide cost savings to a health plan. BIAs for rare disease may be more informative if they focus on DMPs rather than on individual drugs."

The clinical presentation of the disease includes fibrosis, cirrhosis and liver failure. However, the pathogenic mechanism of AATD-mediated liver disease is not well understood. Here, we investigated the role of plasma extracellular vesicles (EVs) in progression of AATD-mediated liver disease. EVs were isolated from plasma of AATD individuals with liver disease and healthy controls. Their cytokines and miRNA content were examined by multiplex assay and small RNA sequencing. The bioactivity of EVs was assessed by qPCR, western blot analysis and immunofluorescent experiments using human hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) treated with EVs isolated from control or AATD plasma samples. We have found that AATD individuals have a distinct population of EVs with pathological cytokine and miRNA contents. When HSCs were cultured with AATD plasma derived-EVs, the expression of genes related to the development of fibrosis were significantly amplified compared to those treated with healthy control plasma EVs. AATD individuals have a distinct population of EVs with abnormal cytokine and miRNA contents and the capacity to activate HSCs and mediate fibrosis. Better understanding of the components which cause liver inflammation and fibrogenesis, leading to further liver injury, has the potential to lead to the development of new treatments or preventive strategies to prevent AATD-mediated liver disease.

AAT is a glycoprotein whose main function is to protect tissues from human neutrophil elastase (HNE) and other proteases released by neutrophils during an inflammatory state. The lack of this inhibitor in human serum is responsible for the onset of alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency (AATD), which is a severe genetic disorder that affects lungs in adults and for which there is currently no cure. Being used, under special circumstances, as a medical treatment of AATD in the so-called \"replacement\" therapy (consisting in the intravenous infusion of the missing protein), AAT is a molecule with a lot of therapeutic importance. For this reason, interest in AAT purification from human plasma or its production in a recombinant version has grown considerably in recent years. This article retraces all technological advances that allowed the manufacturers to move from a few micrograms of partially purified AAT to several grams of highly purified protein. Moreover, the chronic augmentation and maintenance therapy in individuals with emphysema due to congenital AAT deficiency (current applications in the clinical setting) is also presented."

    "abstract": "Alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a rarely diagnosed hereditary condition characterized by low alpha 1 antitrypsin (AAT) levels, which can lead to early-onset emphysema due to accelerated degradation of lung tissue. Similar to C-reactive protein (CRP), AAT is an acute phase reactant, meaning that blood levels rise in response to inflammation, injury or infection. Testing AAT levels is essential in the diagnosis of AATD; however, the presence of inflammation at the time of AATD testing can provide a false 'normal' level reading of the patient's baseline AAT levels. Researchers from a US-wide screening program for AATD found that a large number of individuals with AATD variants (particularly with the PI*MZ genotype) presented with elevated CRP levels (≥5 mg/L), suggesting the presence of inflammation. Using a series of calculations, the relationship between AAT and CRP levels was characterized and found to be genotype specific. We have developed a publicly available, easy-to-use online calculator (PredictAAT) that enables the instant calculation of predicted baseline AAT levels in patients exhibiting elevated CRP levels that accounts for specific AATD genotype. There is a need to raise awareness of the importance of simultaneous determination of AAT and CRP levels to aid the accurate diagnosis of patients with AATD. The PredictAAT calculator is therefore a valuable tool for physicians to enhance early disease diagnosis and individualize treatment."

Deregulation of autophagy is a key mechanism in the pathogenesis and progression of several liver diseases. Deficient autophagy can contribute to liver steatosis, to endoplasmic reticulum stress and to the progression of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Chronic alcohol consumption inhibits autophagy. The accumulated mutant protein in the endoplasmic reticulum can be degraded by autophagy in alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency. Hepatitis C and B viruses may exploit the autophagy pathway to promote the own replication. Hepatitis C virus non-structural protein 5A and 5B have roles in the induction of autophagosomes. MicroRNAs regulate multiple physiological, pathological functions and autophagy through the modulation of gene expression. MicroRNA-122 is involved in HCV replication. In HBV-infected livers, the microRNA pathways related to cell death, DNA damage, recombination and signal transduction were activated. MicroRNA-122 effects multiple important factors which regulate the lipid and carbohydrate metabolisms in human non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Oxidative stress and free oxygen radicals generation involved in alcoholic liver diseases development are regulated by microRNAs through different pathways.

Understanding the key actors in viral entry is crucial for advancing knowledge of virus tropism, pathogenesis, and potential therapeutic targets. We aimed to investigate the role of naïve serum and alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT) in inhibiting protease-mediated SARS-CoV-2 entry and explore the implications of AAT deficiency on susceptibility to different SARS-CoV-2 variants. Our study demonstrates that naïve serum exhibits significant inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 entry, with AAT identified as the major serum protease inhibitor potently restricting entry. Using pseudoparticles, replication-competent pseudoviruses, and authentic SARS-CoV-2, we show that AAT inhibition occurs at low concentrations compared with those in serum and bronchoalveolar tissues, suggesting physiological relevance. Furthermore, sera from subjects with an AAT-deficient genotype show reduced ability to inhibit entry of both Wuhan-Hu-1 (WT) and B.1.617.2 (Delta) but exhibit no difference in inhibiting B.1.1.529 (Omicron) entry. AAT may have a variant-dependent therapeutic potential against SARS-CoV-2. Our findings highlight the importance of further investigating the complex interplay between proteases, antiproteases, and spike glycoprotein activation in SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses to identify potential therapeutic targets and improve understanding of disease pathogenesis."

Plasma-derived AAT, indicated for genetic AAT deficiency, is presently being explored for additional medical indications. Unlike corticosteroids, some anti-inflammatory activities of AAT involve NF-κB-dependent outcomes, e.g., induction of IL-1R antagonist. AAT activities were compared to dexamethasone (DEX), using various in-vitro cells assays, animal studies, and NF-κB-p65 localization and activity studies. Results demonstrate a cytokine shift towards resolution in AAT-treated cells, as opposed to pan-suppression in DEX-treated cells. AAT enhanced, while DEX suppressed LPS-induced IL-1Ra production and re-epithelialization. When drugs were combined, AAT allowed the immunosuppressive DEX activities, while DEX at medium to high levels antagonized beneficial AAT effects. Interestingly, lower levels of DEX maintained the immunosuppressive effect, while allowing upregulation of IL-1Ra. Therefore, AAT may represent a distinct endogenous anti-inflammatory, resolution-promoting agent that may improve tissue well-being while preventing undesired corticostroids side effects."

    "title": "The Importance of Reference Centers and Registries for Rare Diseases: The Example of Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency.",
    "abstract": "Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a rare and underdiagnosed disease that is associated with the development of liver disease in adults and children and pulmonary emphysema in adults. Several studies have shown that there is limited knowledge about the disease and its diagnosis among health care providers, and there is an important inequity in the access to specialized care and appropriate treatment across Europe. The European Commision and the European Respiratory Society (ERS) recommend that the care of patients with AATD must be organized in reference centers at national or regional levels. These reference centers must provide optimal clinical care in terms of adequate diagnostic techniques, such as phenotyping and genotyping, and ensure access to treatment according to guidelines. Reference centers should also provide continuous medical education for health care professionals, genetic counseling, collaboration with patient associations and promote collaborative research and clinical trials with new and existing treatments for the disease. These centers must have a registry of their activity and collaborate with large, international, multicenter registries, such as the European Alpha-1 antitrypsin Deficiency Research Collaboration (EARCO) international registry, which is endorsed by the ERS, and aims to recruit up to 3,000 patients over a period of three years and prospectively follow them to better understand the natural history of the disease and the impact of different treatments on outcomes in a real life setting. International collaboration and standardized collection of high-quality prospective data will provide new insights into the clinical manifestations and prognosis of AATD."

    "title": "Gene Therapy in Rare Respiratory Diseases: What Have We Learned So Far?",
    "abstract": "Gene therapy is an alternative therapy in many respiratory diseases with genetic origin and currently without curative treatment. After five decades of progress, many different vectors and gene editing tools for genetic engineering are now available. However, we are still a long way from achieving a safe and efficient approach to gene therapy application in clinical practice. Here, we review three of the most common rare respiratory conditions-cystic fibrosis (CF), alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD), and primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD)-alongside attempts to develop genetic treatment for these diseases. Since the 1990s, gene augmentation therapy has been applied in multiple clinical trials targeting CF and AATD, especially using adeno-associated viral vectors, resulting in a good safety profile but with low efficacy in protein expression. Other strategies, such as non-viral vectors and more recently gene editing tools, have also been used to address these diseases in pre-clinical studies. The first gene therapy approach in PCD was in 2009 when a lentiviral transduction was performed to restore gene expression in vitro; since then, transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALEN) technology has also been applied in primary cell culture. Gene therapy is an encouraging alternative treatment for these respiratory diseases; however, more research is needed to ensure treatment safety and efficacy."

    "abstract": "Alpha 1-antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency, a hereditary disorder characterized by low serum levels of functional AAT, is associated with early development of panacinar emphysema. AAT inhibits serine proteases, including neutrophil elastase, protecting the lung from proteolytic destruction. Cigarette smoke, pollution, and inflammatory cell-mediated oxidation of methionine (M) 351 and 358 inactivates AAT, limiting lung protection. In vitro studies using amino acid substitutions demonstrated that replacing M351 with valine (V) and M358 with leucine (L) on a normal M1 alanine (A) 213 background provided maximum antiprotease protection despite oxidant stress. We hypothesized that a onetime administration of a serotype 8 adeno-associated virus (AAV8) gene transfer vector coding for the oxidation-resistant variant AAT (A213/V351/L358; 8/AVL) would maintain antiprotease activity under oxidant stress compared with normal AAT (A213/M351/M358; 8/AMM). 8/AVL was administered via intravenous (IV) and intrapleural (IPL) routes to C57BL/6 mice. High, dose-dependent AAT levels were found in the serum and lung epithelial lining fluid (ELF) of mice administered 8/AVL or 8/AMM by IV or IPL. 8/AVL serum and ELF retained serine protease-inhibitory activity despite oxidant stress while 8/AMM function was abolished. 8/AVL represents a second-generation gene therapy for AAT deficiency providing effective antiprotease protection even with oxidant stress."

    "abstract": "The role of MZ phenotype of α 1 antitrypsin (α1AT) deficiency as a potential cofactor in advanced liver disease arising from other primary causes is not widely understood. In the general population, MZ phenotype accounts for 2%-4% in Europe and 2%-7.1% in North America. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of the MZ phenotype among various causes of cirrhosis in the United States in the modern era and its impact on pulmonary function before and after liver transplantation. This retrospective study included adult patients with cirrhosis who underwent liver transplantation at Mayo Clinic. Participants' data including pathogenesis of cirrhosis, model for end-stage liver disease-Na score, α1AT phenotype, liver decompensation events, and pulmonary outcomes was determined by retrospective review of the liver transplantation database. One hundred thirty of 1341 adult patients with cirrhosis (9.7%) were α1AT MZ carriers. When comparing the distribution of protease inhibitor (PI) MZ among different pathogenesis, the prevalence of MZ was significantly increased in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), alcoholic liver disease (ALD), and cryptogenic cirrhosis compared with other causes. Thirty-seven of 171 with NASH (22%), 37 of 187 with ALD (20%), and 9 of 39 with cryptogenic cirrhosis (23.1%) were identified as PI MZ, while in other subgroups; we detected 18 of 320 with viral hepatitis, and 11 of 339 with primary biliary cholangitis/primary sclerosing cholangitis. Also, MZ patients were more likely to develop preoperative chronic obstructive lung disease, and postoperative pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary embolism than MM patients. The rates of preoperative and postoperative pulmonary complications were found to be higher in PI MZ patients than in PI MM patients. The MZ phenotype was significantly enriched in NASH, ALD, and cryptogenic cirrhosis."

    "abstract": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous syndrome and may comprise several different phenotypes that are driven by different molecular mechanisms (endotypes). Several different clinical, genetic, and inflammatory phenotypes of COPD have been recognized and this may lead to more precise effective therapies. The different clinical phenotypes, including smoking <i>versus</i> nonsmoking COPD, small airway disease <i>versus</i> emphysema, non-exacerbators <i>versus</i> frequent exacerbators are discussed. Rare genetic endotypes (alpha<sub>1</sub>-antitrypsin deficiency, telomerase polymorphisms), and inflammatory phenotypes (eosinophilic <i>versus</i> neutrophilic) are also recognized in stable and exacerbating patients and have implications for the choice of therapy. Clinical phenotypes have so far not proved to be very useful in selecting more personalized therapy for COPD. Even with genetic endotypes, this has not led to improved therapy. More promising is the recognition that COPD patients who have increased sputum or blood eosinophils tend to have more frequent exacerbations and inhaled corticosteroids are more effective in preventing exacerbation. Increased blood eosinophils have proved to be a useful biomarker now used to target ICS more effectively. Furthermore, COPD patients with low eosinophils are more likely to get pneumonia with ICS and to have lower airway bacterial colonization."

    "abstract": "Inhalation therapy is integral in the management of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Specifically, intravenous augmentation therapy is available to patients with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD), although there is insufficient alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) delivery to the lungs to modify airways inflammation. In contrast, the inhaled route allows replacement therapy to reach the target site of action and with higher AAT levels. Patients certainly support the inhalation route as an alternative to intravenous injections, obviating repetitive needle insertion and allowing treatment empowerment rather than dependency on traveling to specialized units. The difficulty with inhalation has been the ability to target the formulation to the pathophysiological site of disease: the emphysematous lung parenchyma of the small alveolated airways. Recent advances have suggested nebulizers as being able to deliver an adequate dose, consistently and reproducibly, and, coupled with developments in formulation science, allowed replacement therapy to reach the epithelial lining fluid of the small airways. The bench science has been translated to the first randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial to study the effects of nebulized AAT, which, although not meeting the primary endpoint of prolonging time to first exacerbation, showed this treatment modality was safe and achievable in a large patient cohort. Indeed, learning from this trial suggests the importance of choosing the right clinical endpoints, and recent key advances in lung physiology indices allow better assessment of the \"silent zone\" of small airways disease. Knowledge from other respiratory diseases will complement treating patients with AATD, where there is considerable innovation in aerosol science and inhalation medicine directed at utilizing the inhaled route. Indeed, it could be postulated that the inhaled route may not only achieve local pulmonary therapeutic benefit, but through systemic absorption and controlled pharmacokinetic profiling, the formulation may reach and treat liver disease."

    "abstract": "Deep medicine is rapidly moving towards a high-definition approach for therapeutic management of the patient as an individual given the rapid progress of genome sequencing technologies and machine learning algorithms. While considered a monogenic disease, alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency (AATD) patients present with complex and variable phenotypes we refer to as the \"hallmarks of AATD\" that involve distinct molecular mechanisms in the liver, plasma and lung tissues, likely due to both coding and non-coding variation as well as genetic and environmental modifiers in different individuals. Herein, we briefly review the current therapeutic strategies for the management of AATD. To embrace genetic diversity in the management of AATD, we provide an overview of the disease phenotypes of AATD patients harboring different AAT variants. Linking genotypic diversity to phenotypic diversity illustrates the potential for sequence-specific regions of AAT protein fold design to play very different roles during nascent synthesis in the liver and/or function in post-liver plasma and lung environments. We illustrate how to manage diversity with recently developed machine learning (ML) approaches that bridge sequence-to-function-to-structure knowledge gaps based on the principle of spatial covariance (SCV). SCV relationships provide a deep understanding of the genotype to phenotype transformation initiated by AAT variation in the population to address the role of genetic and environmental modifiers in the individual. Embracing the complexity of AATD in the population is critical for risk management and therapeutic intervention to generate a high definition medicine approach for the patient."

    "abstract": "Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is an important, inherited cause of chronic liver disease. Marked variation in fibrosis stages in patients with homozygous deficiency and those factors that determine whether heterozygous carriers develop liver fibrosis, remain unexplained. Murine studies implicate polymerized alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) within hepatocytes as pathogenic. The relationship between the quantity of polymerized AAT within hepatocytes (polymer load), stage of hepatic fibrosis and liver-related clinical outcomes (death, evolution to hepatocellular carcinoma, or need for liver transplantation) were investigated using liver tissue from 92 patients at first presentation with either homozygous or heterozygous AATD. Further tissue-based studies were undertaken to determine if polymerized AAT was associated with failure of cell cycle progression, accelerated aging or hepatocyte senescence by immunohistochemical analysis. The AAT polymer load correlated closely with hepatic fibrosis stage and long-term clinical outcome, independent of homozygous or heterozygous status. AAT polymers within hepatocytes correlated closely with failure of cell cycle progression assessed using cell cycle phase markers, accelerated aging manifest as shortened telomeres and other markers consistent with hepatocyte senescence manifest as the presence of nuclear p21 expression and enlarged nuclei. The proportion of p21 positive hepatocytes or hepatocytes with enlarged nuclei correlated with hepatic fibrosis stage and the long-term clinical outcome. These data suggest that accumulation of AAT polymers within hepatocytes drives senescence. Quantitation of both the AAT polymer load or hepatocyte senescence markers correlated with hepatic fibrosis stage and the long-term clinical outcome. Either or both could be considered markers of disease severity and treatment response in clinical trials."

    "abstract": "α<sub>1</sub>-Antitrypsin (AAT) encoded by the <i>SERPINA1</i> gene is an acute-phase protein synthesized in the liver and secreted into the circulation. Its primary role is to protect lung tissue by inhibiting neutrophil elastase. The Z allele of <i>SERPINA1</i> encodes a mutant AAT, named ATZ, that changes the protein structure and leads to its misfolding and polymerization, which cause endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and liver disease through a gain-of-function toxic mechanism. Hepatic retention of ATZ results in deficiency of one of the most important circulating proteinase inhibitors and predisposes to early-onset emphysema through a loss-of-function mechanism. The pathogenetic mechanisms underlying the liver disease are not completely understood. C/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP), a transcription factor induced by ER stress, was found among the most up-regulated genes in livers of PiZ mice that express ATZ and in human livers of patients homozygous for the Z allele. Compared with controls, juvenile PiZ/<i>Chop</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice showed reduced hepatic ATZ and a transcriptional response indicative of decreased ER stress by RNA-Seq analysis. Livers of PiZ/<i>Chop</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice also showed reduced <i>SERPINA1</i> mRNA levels. By chromatin immunoprecipitations and luciferase reporter-based transfection assays, CHOP was found to up-regulate <i>SERPINA1</i> cooperating with c-JUN, which was previously shown to up-regulate <i>SERPINA1</i>, thus aggravating hepatic accumulation of ATZ. Increased <i>CHOP</i> levels were detected in diseased livers of children homozygous for the Z allele. In summary, CHOP and c-JUN up-regulate <i>SERPINA1</i> transcription and play an important role in hepatic disease by increasing the burden of proteotoxic ATZ, particularly in the pediatric population."

Around 2%-5% of Europeans are heterozygous for the Z and WT M allele, and there is evidence of increased risk of liver disease when compared with MM A1AT individuals. We have shown that Z and M A1AT can copolymerize in cell models, but there has been no direct observation of heteropolymer formation in vivo. To this end, we developed a monoclonal antibody (mAb2H2) that specifically binds to M in preference to Z A1AT, localized its epitope using crystallography to a region perturbed by the Z (Glu342Lys) substitution, and used Fab fragments to label polymers isolated from an MZ heterozygote liver explant. Glu342 is critical to the affinity of mAb2H2, since it also recognized the mild S-deficiency variant (Glu264Val) present in circulating polymers from SZ heterozygotes. Negative-stain electron microscopy of the Fab2H2-labeled liver polymers revealed that M comprises around 6% of the polymer subunits in the MZ liver sample. These data demonstrate that Z A1AT can form heteropolymers with polymerization-inert variants in vivo with implications for liver disease in heterozygous individuals."

This narrative review describes the impact of the major environmental exposures and summarizes their effect on clinical phenotype and outcomes. In general, patients with AATD are more susceptible to pulmonary damage as a result of the relatively unopposed action of neutrophil elastase, in the context of neutrophilic inflammation stimulated by environmental factors. However, the amount of phenotypic variability explicable by environmental factors is insufficient to account for the wide range of clinical presentations observed, suggesting that a combination of genetic and environmental factors is likely to be responsible."

    "abstract": "Neutrophils have been implicated in the pathogenesis of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) since the first descriptions of the disease. Neutrophil proteinases can cause all lung manifestations of AATD, from small airways destruction, to emphysema, to chronic bronchitis and airflow obstruction. Initially, it was proposed that neutrophil functions were normal in AATD, responding in an initially physiological manner to a high burden of pulmonary inflammation. More recent studies have shed new light on this, describing changes in neutrophil responses (a modulation of usual cellular functions) in the presence of inflammation or infection which might enhance tissue damage while impeding bacterial clearance, providing some evidence to support there being an AATD neutrophil phenotype. Many facets of neutrophil function in AATD can be explained by the loss of alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) in diverse biological processes. If this were the only reason for altered neutrophil functions, one would predict similar disease presentation across affected people. However, this is not the case. Despite similar (low) levels of AAT, lung disease is extremely variable in AATD, with some patients suffering a significant burden of lung disease and some much less, irrespective of smoking habits and, in some cases, despite augmentation therapy. This review will explore how complex neutrophil responses are and how they are altered with age, inflammation and AATD. Further, it will discuss the need to understand more completely which aspects of AATD-associated disease are driven by neutrophils and how patients more susceptible to neutrophil dysfunction could be identified to potentially stratify treatment approaches."

    "abstract": "Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a systemic disorder affecting mainly the lung and the liver and is caused by mutations in <i>SERPINA1</i>, the AAT gene. A homozygous \"Pi*Z\" mutation (Pi*ZZ genotype) may cause liver fibrosis on its own independently of pulmonary AATD manifestation, while heterozygous Pi*Z carriage (Pi*MZ genotype) is considered a strong risk factor for development of liver cirrhosis in patients with concomitant liver disease such as alcoholic and non-alcoholic liver disease. In Pi*ZZ homozygotes, liver disease constitutes the second leading cause of death and is highly heterogeneous. About 35% of Pi*ZZ individuals display significant liver fibrosis on biopsy (i.e., fibrosis stage ≥ 2 on scale 0-4). Among non-invasive methods for liver fibrosis assessment, liver stiffness measurement (LSM) via vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE) has been most widely evaluated. Based on these data, Pi*ZZ adults have 20x increased odds of developing advanced liver fibrosis (i.e., fibrosis stage ≥ 3) than adults without AAT mutation. Risk factors for accelerated fibrosis progression are male sex, age ≥ 50 years, alcohol misuse, obesity, diabetes mellitus, or metabolic syndrome. Unlike VCTE, other ultrasound- and magnetic resonance-based elastography methods have been assessed in small cohorts of Pi*ZZ individuals and remain to be comprehensively validated. Among blood-based fibrosis tests, AST-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) correlates moderately with histologic fibrosis stage and LSM. Given APRI's wide availability, it can be used for risk stratification as an adjunct to LSM or when LSM is not at hand. Despite recent efforts, AATD-related liver disease, especially for genotypes other than Pi*ZZ, remains greatly understudied. AATD individuals should be offered liver biochemistry, liver ultrasound, and non-invasive fibrosis assessment at the time of diagnosis to detect potential complications and for proper risk stratification. If signs of AATD-related liver disease occur (i.e., pathologic fibrosis test or repeatedly elevated liver enzymes), patients should be referred to a health care center specialized in AATD-related liver disease and be screened for potentially treatable comorbidities. To exclude the latter, they may need a liver biopsy. Moreover, every health care provider of an AATD individual should be aware of the potential liver manifestation, counsel their patient on modifiable hepatic risk factors, and offer them regular liver check-ups."

Our goal was to characterize these changes over time in our setting. <b>Methods:</b> Retrospective cohort study in a tertiary center, enrolling patients born between January 1985 and October 2019. The cohort was divided into two periods, before (A; <i>n</i> = 67) and after (B; <i>n</i> = 87) the year 2000; and in two groups, according to patient's outcome (favorable, unfavorable). Overall survival and survival with and without orthotopic liver transplant (OLT) were evaluated in the two periods (A and B) and in different subgroups of underlying entities. <b>Results:</b> We found that the age of cholestasis recognition decreased significantly from period A to period B [median 43 days and 22 days, respectively, (<i>p</i> < 0.001)]; the changes in epidemiology were relevant, with a significant decrease in alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency (<i>p</i> < 0.001) and an increase in transient cholestasis (<i>p</i> = 0.004). A next-generation sequencing (NGS) panel available since mid-2017 was applied to 13 patients with contributory results in 7, but, so far, only in 2 patients led to conclusive diagnosis of underlying entities. The number of cases of idiopathic cholestasis did not vary significantly. Over time there was no significant change in the outcome (<i>p</i> = 0.116). Overall survival and survival without OLT had no significant improvement during the period of observation (in periods A and B, 86 vs. 88%, and 85 vs. 87%, respectively). However, in period B, with OLT we achieved the goal of 100% of survival rate. <b>Conclusions:</b> Our data suggest that transient cholestasis became a very important subset of neonatal cholestasis, requiring specific guidance. The NGS panels can provide important inputs on disease diagnosis but, if applied without strict criteria and expertise, they can open a Pandora's box due to misinterpretation. Despite all the advances in accurate diagnosis and timely management-including early recognition of cholestasis-the improvement in patient outcomes and survival were still not significant."

After intrapulmonary delivery into mouse models with acute lung inflammation, the volatile reporters are released and expelled in breath at levels detectable by mass spectrometry. These breath signals can identify diseased mice with high sensitivity as early as 10 min after nanosensor administration. Using these nanosensors, we performed serial breath tests to monitor dynamic changes in neutrophil elastase activity during lung infection and to assess the efficacy of a protease inhibitor therapy targeting neutrophil elastase for the treatment of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency."

Allele-specific genotyping for the 14 most common mutations was done with the Luminex 200 Instrument System. Gene sequencing was done if none of the mutations were found and the AAT serum level was <60mg/dl, or by request from the clinician in charge. At the time of the present report, 5803 (92.9%) samples were processed, 4984 (85.9%) from buccal swab and 819 (14.1%) from DBS. The prevalence of the frequent allele combinations were: MS 19.0%, MZ 14.4%, SS 2.9%, SZ 3.7%, and ZZ: 1.4%. Globally, Z carriers represented 20.0% and S carriers 26.6% of this population, with differences seen between regions. 209 (3.6%) were identified carrying rare alleles, 12 (0.2%) carrying null alleles and 14 (0.3%) new mutations were described. Respiratory diseases other than COPD, including poorly controlled asthma or bronchiectasis, also presented AATD mutations.

Inherited serum deficiency disorders, such as hemophilia and AATD, have been considered ideal candidates for gene therapy. Although viral vector-meditated transduction of the liver has demonstrated utility in hemophilia, similar success has not been achieved for AATD. The challenge for AAT gene therapy is achieving protective levels of AAT locally in the lung and mitigating potential liver toxicities linked to systemically administered viral vectors. Current strategies with ongoing clinical trials involve different routes of adeno-associated virus administrations, such as intramuscular and intrapleural injections, to provide consistent therapeutic levels from nonhepatic organ sites. Nevertheless, exploration of alternative methods of nonhepatic sourcing of AAT has been of great interest in the field. In this regard, pulmonary endothelium-targeted adenovirus vector could be a key technical mandate to achieve local augmentation of AAT within the lower respiratory tract, with the potential benefit of circumventing liver toxicities. In addition, incorporation of the CRISPR/Cas9 (CRISPR-associated protein 9) nuclease system into gene-delivery technologies has provided adjunctive technologies that could fully realize a one-time treatment for sustained, lifelong expression of AAT in patients with AATD. This review will focus on the adeno-associated virus- and adenoviral vector-mediated gene therapy strategies for the pulmonary manifestations of AATD and show that endeavoring to use genome-editing techniques will advance the current strategy to one fully compatible with direct human translation."

    "abstract": "Connective tissue changes due to ageing or diseases leading to changes in the colonic wall are one theory for the development of diverticula. Alpha-1-antitrypsin (A1AT), a protease inhibitor that protects connective tissue, possibly plays a role in the aetiology of diverticulosis. The aim of this study was to explore associations between the development of diverticula and A1AT deficiency. This was a multicentre prospective case-control study. A total of 221 patients aged ≥ 60 years with acute abdominal pain undergoing abdominal CT were included and analysed. Patients with diverticula were defined as the research group, patients without diverticula as controls. Genotype analysis for A1AT deficiency was performed. Twenty-six of 221 (11.8%) patients were diagnosed with (being a carrier of) A1AT deficiency. A non-significant difference in prevalence between patients with and without diverticula was found, 20 (13.9%) of 144 vs 6 (7.8%) of 77, respectively, with a crude OR of 1.9 (95% CI 0.7-5.0; P = 0.186) and after adjustment for confounders an adjusted OR of 1.5 (95% CI 0.5-4.0; P = 0.466). A non-significant difference in 30-day mortality rate from acute diverticulitis between A1AT deficient patients (or carriers) and those without was observed: two (22.2%) of nine patients with A1AT deficiency vs 1 (1.8%) of 55 without. We found no convincing evidence that A1AT deficiency plays a role in the aetiology of diverticulitis, although deficient patients and carriers had a higher mortality when experiencing diverticulitis. Diverticulitis is a multifactorial disease and larger numbers may be needed to explore the role of A1AT deficiency among other contributing factors."

    "abstract": "To identify predictors of portal hypertension, liver transplantation, and death in North American youth with alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency, and compare with patients with AAT deficiency elsewhere. The Childhood Liver Disease Research Network Longitudinal Observational Study of Genetic Causes of Intrahepatic Cholestasis is a prospective, cohort study of pediatric cholestatic liver diseases, including AAT deficiency, enrolling PIZZ and PISZ subjects 0-25 years of age seen since November 2007 at 17 tertiary care centers in the US and Canada. Data from standard-of-care baseline and annual follow-up visits were recorded from medical records, history, physical examination, and laboratory studies. Participants with portal hypertension were identified based on data collected. We enrolled 350 participants (60% male) with a native liver; 278 (79%) entered the cohort without portal hypertension and 18 developed portal hypertension during follow-up. Thirty participants required liver transplantation; 2 patients died during 1077 person-years of follow-up. There was no difference in participants with or without preceding neonatal cholestasis progressing to transplantation or death during the study (12% vs 7%; P = .09), or in experiencing portal hypertension (28% vs 21%; P = .16); the hazard ratio for neonatal cholestasis leading to portal hypertension was P = .04. Development of portal hypertension was associated with a reduced height Z-score. Portal hypertension in youth with AAT deficiency impacts growth measures. Progression to liver transplantation is slow and death is rare, but the risk of complications and severe liver disease progression persists throughout childhood. A history of neonatal cholestasis is a weak predictor of severe disease."

    "abstract": "Individuals with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) have marked heterogeneity in lung function, suspected to be related to a combination of both environmental (e.g., cigarette smoking) and genetic factors. Lung function is heritable in the general population and in persons with severe AATD. Several genetic modifiers of lung function in persons with AATD have been described; however, replication is lacking. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) of lung function in persons with AATD has yet to be performed and may inform whether genetic determinants of lung function are overlapping in persons with AATD and in the general population. As GWASs require large sample sizes for adequate power, genetic risk scores offer an alternate approach to assess the overlap of genetic determinants of lung function in the general population in persons with AATD. Where GWASs are limited to common genetic variant discovery, whole genome sequencing (for rare variant discovery) and integrative genomic studies (examining the influence of genetic variants on gene, protein, and metabolite levels) offer potential for an expanded discovery of genetic modifiers of lung function in AATD. In the following review we examine past descriptions of genetic modifiers of lung function in AATD and describe a path forward to further investigate and define the likely genetic modifiers of lung function in AATD."

COPD patients often present with malnutrition, sarcopenia, and osteoporosis with possible onset of cachexia, with an inadequate dietary intake and a poor quality of life. Moreover, diet plays a pivotal role in patients with COPD through three mechanisms: regulation of carbon dioxide produced/oxygen consumed, inflammation, and oxidative stress. A narrative review based on 99 eligible studies was performed to evaluate current evidence regarding optimum diet therapy for the management of COPD, and then a food pyramid was built accordingly. The food pyramid proposal will serve to guide energy and dietary intake in order to prevent and treat nutritionally related COPD complications and to manage progression and COPD-related symptoms. The nutrition pyramid described in our narrative review is hypothetical, even in light of several limitations of the present review; the main limitation is the fact that to date there are no randomized controlled trials in the literature clearly showing that improved nutrition, via the regulation of carbon dioxide produced/oxygen consumed, inflammation and oxidative stress, improves symptoms and/or progression of COPD. Even if this nutritional pyramid is hypothetical, we hope that it can serve the valuable purpose of helping researchers focus on the often-ignored possible connections between body composition, nutrition, and COPD."

The aim was to evaluate the risk of incident IHD in patients with severe AATD compared with a random sample of the general population, with known smoking habits. AAT-deficient individuals, phenotype PiZZ (n=1545), were included in the Swedish National AATD Register. Controls (n=5883) were selected from population-based cohorts in Northern Sweden. Data on IHD and comorbidities were obtained by nationwide cross-linkage with the Swedish National Patient Register. Risk factors for incident IHD were analyzed using Cox regression, adjusted for age, gender, smoking status and the presence of COPD, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and diabetes. At inclusion, 46% of the PiZZ individuals and 53% of the controls were never-smokers. During follow-up (median 16 years; range 0.2-23), 8% (n=123) of PiZZ individuals and 12% (n=690) of controls developed IHD. The controls had a significantly higher risk for incident IHD than the PiZZ individuals, with adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 1.8 (95% CI 1.4-2.3). The risk was higher for controls in both ever-smokers (HR 2.1; 95% CI 1.5-2.9) and never-smokers (HR 1.5; 95% CI 1.1-2.2).

A central electronic database was established to permit the upload of anonymised patient data from remote sites. Prospectively collected CT data were recorded onto disc, anonymised, analysed at the coordinating centre and compared with the clinical features of the disease. Tertiary referral centres with expertise in the management of AATD focused on academic Biomedical Research Units and Wellcome Clinical Research Facilities. Data were collected from 187 patients over 1 year from eight UK academic sites. This included patient demographics, postbronchodilator physiology, health status and CT. Analysis was undertaken at the coordinating centre in Birmingham. Patient recruitment in the 12 months reached 94% of target (set at 200) covering the whole spectrum of the disease from those with normal lung function to very severe chronic obstructive lung disease. CT scan suitable for analysis was available from 147 (79%) of the patients. CT density, analysed as the threshold for the lowest 15% of lung voxels, showed statistically significant relationships with the objective physiological parameters of lung function as determined by spirometric Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) severity staging (p<0.001) and carbon monoxide gas transfer (p<0.01). Density also correlated with subjective measures of quality of life (p=0.02). Establishment of the network for data collection and its transfer was highly successful facilitating future collaboration for the study of this rare disease and its management. CT densitometry correlated well with the objective clinical features of the disease supporting its role as the specific marker of the associated emphysema and its severity. Correlations with subjective measures of health, however, were generally weak indicating other factors play a role."

    "abstract": "Commonly categorized as a rare disease, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is neither rare, when compared to many other genetic disorders, nor an actual disease, but rather a predisposition toward a wide variety of diseases. It is one of the most common genetic disorders which can lead to a spectrum of clinical manifestations, ranging from no symptoms to progressively debilitating systemic disease, most commonly affecting the lung and liver. It is therefore imperative for clinicians to recognize and be familiar with the spectrum of presentations, methods of diagnosis, and clinical management of AATD. It is also imperative for scientists to recognize the potential for progress in the management of this disorder. This review focuses on the current state of knowledge of AATD, including the wide range of presentations, diagnosis, and clinical management. In addition to the clinical implications of severe AATD, we discuss the relevance of heterozygous state with mild or moderate AATD in the development of both lung and liver disease. While our understanding of the multiple roles of alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) is on the rise, with appreciation of its immunomodulatory, anti-infective, and anti-inflammatory properties, this knowledge has yet to impact our ability to predict outcomes. We discuss nuances of augmentation therapy and review novel therapeutic approaches currently under investigation. With the expanding knowledge about the complexities of AAT function and its clinical relevance, and with the increasing ability to diagnose early and intervene on AATD, it should be our goal to change the perception of AATD as a correctable inherited disorder rather than a fatal disease."

The presence and severity of periodontitis (using two international criteria) and lung disease were assessed in 156 COPD patients with and without AATD accounting for common confounding factors. Saliva and systemic inflammatory markers were measured by ELISA together with neutrophil migration. COPD and AATD patients exhibited higher prevalence of periodontitis (COPD 95%; AATD 88%) than reported in unselected community-dwelling populations even when risk factors (age, smoking history, socio-economic status and dental habits) were considered. Periodontitis severity associated with lung disease severity (AATD, periodontitis versus no periodontitis; FEV1 = 56% versus 99% predicted; TLCO = 59% versus 81% predicted, p < .0001 for both). Neutrophil migratory accuracy declined in stage II-IV periodontitis patients with COPD or AATD compared to COPD or AATD with no or stage I periodontitis. Improved dental habits appeared to be associated with a reduction in exacerbation frequency in COPD. The results support shared pathophysiology between periodontitis and COPD, especially when associated with AATD. This may reflect an amplification of neutrophilic inflammation and altered neutrophil functions, already described in periodontitis, COPD and AATD."

    "abstract": "Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is of importance in the pathogenesis of pulmonary emphysema, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD), and bronchiectasis. Various pulmonary disorders are a typical feature of primary immunodeficiency disease (PID). This includes recurrent pulmonary infections, immunodysregulation, and autoinflammatory diseases. As a result, incidence of acute and chronic pulmonary diseases is higher. Interestingly, pulmonary morbidity in PID and AATD share similar features. To study the coexistence of AATD in patients suffering from PID, we performed the underlying investigation. We evaluated a study group of 149 patients (<i>n</i> = 149) with PID. In total, serum AAT concentrations were available for 110 patients (<i>n</i> = 110). For the identified patients, we analyzed both clinical associations and interactions. Among the investigated patients, reduced serum AAT levels were detected in 7 patients. With regard to the genotype, PI∗ZZ was found in 2 patients, whereas PI∗MZ was observed in 5 patients. Independent of the underlying phenotype, obstructive lung diseases were found in 2 patients with PI∗ZZ and 2 patients with PI∗MZ. In Germany, the estimated percentage for PI∗ZZ and PI∗MZ is 0.01% and 1.9%, respectively. As demonstrated, the ratio in our study group was even higher. We identified seven patients with AATD. Since AATD contributes to pulmonary morbidity in PID patients, systematic underdiagnosis of the coexistence might yield a strong clinical impact. Hence, AAT analysis should be offered to all patients with confirmed PID diagnoses. To strengthen this finding, we suggest the investigation of larger databases."

Mutations of the <i>SERPINA1</i> gene results in a misfolded α1AT protein which aggregates inside hepatocytes causing cellular damage. Therefore, inhibition of mutant α1AT production is one practical strategy to alleviate liver damage. Here we show that proteasome inhibitors can selectively downregulate α1AT expression in human hepatocytes by suppressing the translation of α1AT. Translational suppression of α1AT is mediated by phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α and increased association of RNA binding proteins, especially stress granule protein Ras GAP SH3 binding protein (G3BP1), with α1AT mRNA. Treatment of human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived hepatocytes with a proteasome inhibitor also results in translational inhibition of mutant α1AT in a similar manner. Together we revealed a previously undocumented role of proteasome inhibitors in the regulation of α1AT translation."

Among all the known mutations in the <i>SERPINA1</i> gene, homozygous for the Z allele is well-known to result in both lung and liver disease. Unlike the lung injury that occurs in adulthood with the environment (notably, tobacco) as a co-factor, the hepatic damage is more complicated. Despite a common underlying gene mutation, the liver disease associated with AATD presents a considerable variability in the age-of-onset and severity, ranging from transient neonatal cholestasis (in early childhood) to cirrhosis and liver cancer (in childhood and adulthood). Given that all the cofactors- genetics and/or environmental- have not been fully identified, it is still impossible to predict which individuals with AATD may develop severe liver disease. The discovery of these modifiers represents the major challenge for the detection, diagnosis, and development of new therapies to provide alternative options to liver transplantation. The aim of this current review is to provide an updated overview of our knowledge on why some AATD patients associated with liver damage progress poorly."

    "abstract": "Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is an inherited condition characterized by reduced levels of serum AAT due to mutations in the <i>SERPINA1</i> (Serpin family A member 1) gene. The Pi*S (Glu264Val) is one of the most frequent deficient alleles of AATD, showing high incidence in the Iberian Peninsula. Herein, we describe two new alleles carrying an S mutation but producing a null phenotype: QO<sub>Vigo</sub> and QO<sub>Aachen</sub>. The new alleles were identified by sequencing the <i>SERPINA1</i> gene in three patients who had lower AAT serum levels than expected for the initial genotype. These alleles are the result of combined mutations <i>in cis</i> in a PI*S allele. Sequencing detected the S mutation <i>in cis</i> with Tyr138Cys (S+Tyr138Cys) in two patients, whereas a third one had the S mutation <i>in cis</i> with Pro391Thr variant (S+Pro391Thr). When expressed in a cellular model, these variants caused strong AAT polymerization and very low AAT secretion to almost undetectable levels. The isoelectric focusing method for plasma AAT phenotyping did not show AAT protein encoded by the novel mutant alleles, behaving as null. We called these alleles PI*S-plus because the S variant was phased with another variant conferring more aggressive characteristics to the allele. The current data demonstrate that the clinical variability observed in AATD can be explained by additional genetic variation, such as dual <i>cis</i>-acting variants in the <i>SERPINA1</i> gene. The possible existence of other unrevealed variants combined in the PI*S alleles should be considered to improve the genetic diagnosis of the patients."

We compare the organ system involvement of this cohort with other available cohorts. We conducted a retrospective data collection and analysis of 187 subjects with biopsy-proven sarcoidosis seen at a tertiary center. Organ system involvement was determined using the WASOG sarcoidosis organ assessment instrument. Clinical phenotype groups were classified using the Genomic Research in Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency and Sarcoidosis criteria. Mean subject age at diagnosis was 45.8 ± 12.4, with a higher proportion of males (55.1%), and a higher proportion of blacks (17.1%) compared to the racial distribution of Minnesota residents (5.95%). The majority (71.1%) of subjects required anti-inflammatory therapy for at least 1 month. Compared to the A Case Control Etiologic Study of Sarcoidosis cohort, there was a higher frequency of extra-thoracic lymph node (34.2% vs. 15.2%), eye (20.9% vs. 11.8%), liver (17.6% vs. 11.5%), spleen (20.9% vs. 6.7%), musculoskeletal (9.6% vs. 0.5%), and cardiac (10.7% vs. 2.3%) involvement in our cohort. A multisystem disease with at least five different organs involved was identified in 13.4% of subjects.

    "abstract": "Inflammatory bowel disease can manifest in many extraintestinal organ systems. The most frequently involved extraintestinal locations include the mucocutaneous, hepatobiliary, and ocular organ systems. The respiratory tract is less commonly involved and is therefore frequently overlooked. Consequently, it is believed that involvement of the respiratory tract in patients with inflammatory bowel disease is underreported. The pathogenesis is thought to be multifactorial, involving the common embryologic origin shared by the respiratory and luminal digestive tract, molecular mimicry, and immunologic interactions leading to immune-complex deposition in affected tissue. The spectrum of manifestations of the respiratory tract related to inflammatory bowel disease is broad. It not only includes direct involvement of the respiratory tract (ie, airways, interstitium, and pleura) but also can result as a consequence of systemic involvement such as in thromboembolic events. In addition, it may also be related to other conditions that affect the respiratory tract such as sarcoidosis and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. Though some conditions related to respiratory tract involvement might be subclinical, others may have life-threatening consequences. It is critical to approach patients with suspected inflammatory bowel disease-related respiratory tract involvement in concert with pulmonology, infectious diseases, and any other pertinent experts, as treatments may require a multidisciplinary overlap of measures. Therefore, it is of paramount importance for the clinician to be aware of the array of respiratory tract manifestations of patients with inflammatory bowel disease, in addition to the possible spectrum of therapeutic measures."

A sub-library of individual \"control\" compounds featuring structural diversity at position R1 (1295.R1), was screened and 7 compounds were found to reduce the intracellular accumulation of Z-AAT without affecting cell viability at a concentration of 25ug/ml (about 50 μM). Screening sub-libraries featuring structural diversity at R2 and R3 (1295.R2 and 1295.R3) identified an additional 15 active compounds. Titration experiments identified 3 compounds from the 1295.R2 library that retained activity at 5ug/ml (approx. 10uM). One compound (1295.263) from 1295.R2 decreased intracellular levels of Z-AAT without affecting cell viability and wild-type AAT levels at the concentration of 5ug/ml. Molecular docking of this compound to the Z-AAT crystal structure identified a potential binding site near the C-terminal domain, an identified polymerization site. Our results indicate that screening large mixture-based compound libraries can be used to identify small molecules that may have the potential to treat AATD and other disease."

    "title": "miR-320c Regulates SERPINA1 Expression and Is Induced in Patients With Pulmonary Disease.",
    "abstract": "Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a genetic condition resulting in lung and liver disease with a great clinical variability. MicroRNAs have been identified as disease modifiers; therefore miRNA deregulation could play an important role in disease heterogeneity. Members of miR-320 family are involved in regulating of multiple processes including inflammation, and have potential specific binding sites in the 3'UTR region of SERPINA1 gene. In this study we explore the involvement of miR-320c, a member of this family, in this disease. Firstly in vitro studies were carried out to demonstrate regulation of SERPINA1 gene by miR-320. Furthermore, the expression of miR-320c was analyzed in the blood of 98 individuals with different AAT serum levels by using quantitative PCR and expression was correlated to clinical parameters of the patients. Finally, HL60 cells were used to analyze induction of miR-320c in inflammatory conditions. Overexpression of miR-320 members in human HepG2 cells led to inhibition of SERPINA1 expression. Analysis of miR-320c expression in patient's samples revealed significantly increased expression of miR-320c in individuals with pulmonary disease. Additionally, HL60 cells treated with the pro-inflammatory factor lipopolysaccharide (LPS) showed increase in miR-320c expression, suggesting that miR-320c responds to inflammation. Our findings demonstrate that miR-320c inhibits SERPINA1 expression in a hepatic cell line and its levels in blood are associated with lung disease in a cohort of patients with different AAT serum levels. These results suggest that miR-320c can play a role in AAT regulation and could be a biomarker of inflammatory processes in pulmonary diseases."

    "abstract": "Genome-editing systems based on clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/associated protein (CRISPR/Cas), are emerging as a revolutionary technology for the treatment of various genetic diseases. To date, the delivery of genome-editing biomacromolecules by viral or non-viral vectors have been proposed as new therapeutic options for lung genetic disorders, such as cystic fibrosis (CF) and α-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD), and it has been accepted that these delivery vectors can introduce CRISPR/Cas9 machineries into target cells or tissues in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo. However, the efficient local or systemic delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 elements to the lung, enabled by either viral or by non-viral carriers, still remains elusive. Herein, we first introduce lung genetic disorders and their current treatment options, and then summarize CRISPR/Cas9-based strategies for the therapeutic genome editing of these disorders. We further summarize the pros and cons of different routes of administration for lung genetic disorders. In particular, the potentials of aerosol delivery for therapeutic CRISPR/Cas9 biomacromolecules for lung genome editing are discussed and highlighted. Finally, current challenges and future outlooks in this emerging area are briefly discussed."

    "title": "Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency: Have We Got the Right Proteinase?",
    "abstract": "Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) has traditionally been associated with the development of early onset panlobular emphysema thought to reflect the direct interstitial damage caused by neutrophil elastase. Since this enzyme is highly sensitive to irreversible inhibition by alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT), the logic of intravenous augmentation therapy has remained unquestioned and efficacy is supported by both observational studies and formal clinical trials. However, evidence suggests that although AAT augmentation modulates the progression of emphysema, it only slows it down. This raises the issue of whether our long-held beliefs of the cause of the susceptibility to develop emphysema in deficient individuals are correct. There are several aspects of our understanding of the disease that might benefit from a radical departure from traditional thought. This review addresses these concepts and alternative pathways that may be central to progression of emphysema."

    "abstract": "Laboratory confirmation of alpha-1-antitrypsin (A1AT) deficiency may be achieved by multiple methods. Here, we compare the relative comprehensiveness and efficiency of pathogenic variant (PV) detection of four different protocols utilized at different diagnostic centres in Canada. Diagnostic results from 2011 to 2018 at clinical laboratories in British Columbia (BC), Alberta (AB), Ontario (ON), and Québec (QC) were reviewed. The four labs utilize the following protocols: BC-CGID (serum A1AT Concentration/Genotyping/Isoelectric focussing (IEF)/SERPINA1 DNA sequencing), AB-CID (serum A1AT Concentration/IEF/DNA sequencing), ON-CD (serum A1AT Concentration/DNA sequencing), and QC-G (Genotyping). As the respective catchment areas varied in size and ethnic composition, the comprehensiveness of PV detection was assessed by comparing the frequency of individual genotypes to the ZZ genotype, which is clearly identified by all protocols. Collectively 5399 index patients were tested identifying 396 ZZ genotypes. Serum A1AT concentration as a determinant of further testing efficiently identified PV. ON-CD had the highest detection rate for PV; genotypes with at least one PV, other than S, Z or F, were identified at 0.67/ZZ as compared to <0.2/ZZ (all others). However, ON-CD had the highest rates of undefined molecular variants (UMV) (0.16/ZZ) or likely benign variants (LBV) (0.08/ZZ), compared to all others (<0.12/ZZ and < 0.06/ZZ, respectively). The F variant was identified at 0.10/ZZ, only in the ON-CD and the AB-CID protocols. Collectively, M<sub>Malton</sub> was the next most common variant, identified as a compound heterozygous genotype at 0.04/ZZ, only in the ON-CD and BC-CGID protocols. Strategies which readily detect variants across the full coding sequence of SERPINA1 detect more PV as well as more UMV and LBV."

    "abstract": "The autosomal codominant genetic disorder alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency (AATD) causes pulmonary and liver disease. Individuals homozygous for the mutant Z allele accumulate polymers of Z-AAT protein in hepatocytes, where AAT is primarily produced. This accumulation causes endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, oxidative stress, damage to mitochondria, and inflammation, leading to fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. The magnitude of AAT reduction and duration of response from first-generation intravenously administered RNA interference (RNAi) therapeutic ARC-AAT and then with next-generation subcutaneously administered ARO-AAT were assessed by measuring AAT protein in serum of the PiZ transgenic mouse model and human volunteers. The impact of Z-AAT reduction by RNAi on liver disease phenotypes was evaluated in PiZ mice by measuring polymeric Z-AAT in the liver; expression of genes associated with fibrosis, autophagy, apoptosis, and redox regulation; inflammation; Z-AAT globule parameters; and tumor formation. Ultrastructure of the ER, mitochondria, and autophagosomes in hepatocytes was evaluated by electron microscopy. In mice, sustained RNAi treatment reduced hepatic Z-AAT polymer, restored ER and mitochondrial health, normalized expression of disease-associated genes, reduced inflammation, and prevented tumor formation. RNAi therapy holds promise for the treatment of patients with AATD-associated liver disease. ARO-AAT is currently in phase II/III clinical trials."

Heterozygosity (the Pi∗MZ genotype) is a risk factor for cirrhosis in individuals with liver disease. Up to 4% of Europeans have the Pi∗MZ genotype; we compared features of adults with and without Pi∗MZ genotype among persons without preexisting liver disease. We analyzed data from the European Alpha-1 Liver Cohort, from 419 adults with the Pi∗MZ genotype, 309 adults with the Pi∗ZZ genotype, and 284 individuals without the variant (noncarriers). All underwent a comprehensive evaluation; liver stiffness measurements (LSMs) were made by transient elastography. Liver biopsies were analyzed to define histologic and biochemical features associated with the Pi∗Z variant. Levels of serum transaminases were retrieved from 444,642 participants, available in the United Kingdom biobank. In the UK biobank database, levels of serum transaminases were increased in subjects with the Pi∗MZ genotype compared with noncarriers. In the Alpha-1 Liver Cohort, adults with Pi∗MZ had lower levels of gamma-glutamyl transferase in serum and lower LSMs than adults with the Pi∗ZZ variant, but these were higher than in noncarriers. Ten percent of subjects with the Pi∗MZ genotype vs 4% of noncarriers had LSMs of 7.1 kPa or more (adjusted odds ratio, 4.8; 95% confidence interval, 2.0-11.8). Obesity and diabetes were the most important factors associated with LSMs ≥7.1 kPa in subjects with the Pi∗MZ genotype. AAT inclusions were detected in liver biopsies of 63% of subjects with the Pi∗MZ genotype, vs 97% of subjects with the Pi∗ZZ genotype, and increased with liver fibrosis stages. Subjects with the Pi∗MZ genotype did not have increased hepatic levels of AAT, whereas levels of insoluble AAT varied among individuals. Adults with the Pi∗MZ genotype have lower levels of serum transaminases, fewer AAT inclusions in liver, and lower liver stiffness than adults with the Pi∗ZZ genotype, but higher than adults without the Pi∗Z variant. These findings should help determine risk of subjects with the Pi∗MZ genotype and aid in counseling."

Lack of functioning circulating AAT protein also causes uninhibited elastolytic activity in the lungs leading to AAT deficiency-related emphysema. The only therapy apart from liver transplantation is augmentation with human AAT protein pooled from sera, which is only reserved for patients with advanced lung disease caused by severe AAT deficiency. We tested modified mRNA encoding human AAT in primary human hepatocytes in culture, including hepatocytes from AAT deficient patients. Both expression and functional activity were investigated. Secreted AAT protein increased from 1,14 to 3,43 µg/ml in media from primary human hepatocytes following mRNA treatment as investigated by ELISA and western blot. The translated protein showed activity and protease inhibitory function as measured by elastase activity assay. Also, mRNA formulation in lipid nanoparticles was assessed for systemic delivery in both wild type mice and the NSG-PiZ transgenic mouse model of AAT deficiency. Systemic intravenous delivery of modified mRNA led to hepatic uptake and translation into a functioning protein in mice. These data support the use of systemic mRNA therapy as a potential treatment for AAT deficiency."

In this model, spiperone prevented the development of inflammatory reaction and reduced the area of emphysematous expanded alveolar tissue.

The aim in this study was to evaluate and compare the viability of a composite approach, primarily based on the α1-globulin fraction, in identifying AAT genetic analysis eligible patients against standard screening procedures, based on clinically compatible profiling and circulating AAT < 1 g/L. Methods A total of 21,094 subjects were screened for AATD and deemed eligible when meeting one of these criteria: α1-globulin ≤2.6%; α1-globulin 2.6%-2.9% and AST: >37 U/L and ALT: > 78 U/L; α1-globulin %: 2.9-4.6% and AST: >37 U/L and ALT: >78 U/L and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) >34 mm/h and C-reactive protein (CRP) >3 mg/L. Subjects were genotyped for the AAT gene mutation. Detection rates, including those of the rarest variants, were compared with results from standard clinical screenings. Siblings of mutated subjects were included in the study, and their results compared. Results Eighty-two subjects were identified. Among these, 51.2% were found to carry some Pi*M variant versus 15.9% who were clinically screened. The detection rates of the screening, including relatives, were: 50.5% for the proposed algorithm and 18.9% for the clinically-based screening. Pi*M variant prevalence in the screened population was in line with previous studies. Interestingly, 46% of subjects with Pi*M variants had an AAT plasma level above the 1 g/L threshold. Conclusions A composite algorithm primarily based on the α1-globulin fraction could effectively identify carriers of Pi*M gene mutation. This approach, not requiring clinical evaluation or AAT serum determination, seems suitable for clinical and epidemiological purposes."

It is the best understood genetic risk factor for the development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The diagnosis of A1AD is under-recognized. While there is a significant heterogeneity in disease presentation in relation to the severity of symptoms and prognosis, it is not uncommon for young individuals, including pregnant women to already have moderate to advanced lung disease at the time of diagnosis. Reductions in AAT levels may have unique implications for a gravid patient beyond that of lung disease. Care of the pregnant A1AD patient with chronic lung disease follows the principles of care for the management of airways disease in general with control of symptoms and reduction in exacerbation risk the main tenets of treatment. The effect of A1AD and augmentation in pregnancy has not been studied and thus care is reliant on expert opinion and clinical experience. Providers caring for pregnant patients with A1AD should consider referral to health care systems and providers with specific expertise in A1AD. Ultimately the decision is left to the individual patient and their physician to weigh the risk benefit of cessation or continuation of therapies. In this review, we present the perinatal course of a woman with A1AD and review the available literature pertaining to AAT and pregnancy and discuss the clinical implications."

A variety of detection strategies have been explored in the past and new approaches are emerging as technology advances. Targeted detection includes patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, unexplained chronic liver disease, and family members of affected individuals. Newborn screening, electronic medical record data mining, and direct-to-consumer testing remain options for future detection strategies.

The effect of AAT concentrations on outcomes was assessed in 82 SZ individuals (including lung index cases). Subsequently, we analyzed retrospective SZ registry data to determine the effect of smoking cessation on spirometry decline (<i>n</i> = 60) and plasma anti-neutrophil elastase capacity (<i>n</i> = 20).<b>Measurements and Main Results</b>: No difference between SZ and control never-smokers was seen. Ever smoking was associated with a lower FEV<sub>1</sub>% predicted (-14.3%; <i>P</i> = 0.0092) and a lower FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC ratio (-0.075; <i>P</i> = 0.0041) in SZ-AATD. No association was found between AAT concentration and outcomes for SZ-AATD. Longitudinal analysis of 60 SZ individuals demonstrated that COPD at baseline, but not former smoking or AAT concentrations, predicted greater spirometry decline. Finally, anti-neutrophil elastase capacity did not differ between former smokers and never-smokers (<i>P</i> = 0.67).<b>Conclusions</b>: SZ never-smokers demonstrated no increased risk of COPD, regardless of AAT concentration. Smoking interacts with SZ-AATD to significantly increase airflow obstruction. Former smoking alone is not associated with greater spirometry decline in SZ-AATD, suggesting that cessation attenuates the obstructive process. We found no evidence that the putative protective threshold or AAT concentrations predict risk within the SZ genotype, raising further doubts over the need for intravenous AAT augmentation in this cohort."

    "abstract": "Alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is an under-diagnosed hereditary disorder characterized by reduced serum levels of alpha1-antitrypsin (AAT) and increased risk to develop lung and liver diseases at an early age. AAT is encoded by the highly polymorphic SERPINA1 gene. The most common deficiency alleles are S and Z, but more than 150 rare variants lead to low levels of the protein. To identify these pathological allelic variants, sequencing is required. Since traditional sequencing is expensive and time-consuming, we evaluated the accuracy of A1AT Genotyping Test, a new diagnostic genotyping kit which allows to simultaneously identify and genotype 14 deficiency variants of the SERPINA1 gene based on Luminex technology. A total of 418 consecutive samples with AATD suspicion and submitted to the Italian Reference laboratory between January and April 2016 were analyzed both by applying the diagnostic algorithm currently in use, and by applying A1AT Genotyping Test. The assay gave the following results: 101 samples (24.2%) were positive for at least one of the 14 deficiency variants, 316 (75.6%) were negative for all the variants analyzed. The identified mutations showed a 100% correlation with the results obtained with our diagnostic algorithm. Seventeen samples (4%) resulted negative for the assay but sequencing identified other rare pathological variants in SERPINA1 gene. The A1AT Genotyping Test assay was highly reliable and robust and allowed shorter diagnostic times. In few cases, it has been necessary to sequence the SERPINA1 gene to identify other rare mutations not included in the kit."

    "abstract": "α<sub>1</sub>-Antitrypsin deficiency (AATD), characterised by reduced levels or functionality of α<sub>1</sub>-antitrypsin (AAT), is a significantly underdiagnosed genetic condition that predisposes individuals to lung and liver disease. Most of the available data on AATD are based on the most common, severe deficiency genotype (PI*ZZ); therefore, treatment and monitoring requirements for individuals with the PI*SZ genotype, which is associated with a less severe AATD, are not as clear. Recent genetic data suggest the PI*SZ genotype may be significantly more prevalent than currently thought, due in part to less frequent identification in the clinic and less frequent reporting in registries. Intravenous AAT therapy, the only specific treatment for patients with AATD, has been shown to slow disease progression in PI*ZZ individuals; however, there is no specific evidence for AAT therapy in PI*SZ individuals, and it remains unclear whether AAT therapy should be considered in these patients. This narrative review evaluates the available data on the PI*SZ genotype, including genetic prevalence, the age of diagnosis and development of respiratory symptoms compared with PI*ZZ individuals, and the impact of factors such as index <i>versus</i> non-index identification and smoking history. In addition, the relevance of the putative 11 µM \"protective threshold\" for AAT therapy and the risk of liver disease in PI*SZ individuals is explored. The purpose of this review is to identify open research questions in this area, with the aim of optimising the future identification and management of PI*SZ individuals."

    "abstract": "Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a genetic condition that leads to an increased risk of emphysema and liver disease. Despite extensive investigation, there remain unanswered questions concerning the natural history, pathophysiology, genetics and the prognosis of the lung disease in association with AATD. The European Alpha-1 Clinical Research Collaboration (EARCO) is designed to bring together researchers from European countries and to create a standardised database for the follow-up of patients with AATD. The EARCO Registry is a non-interventional, multicentre, pan-European, longitudinal observational cohort study enrolling patients with AATD. Data will be collected prospectively without interference/modification of patient's management by the study team. The major inclusion criterion is diagnosed severe AATD, defined by an AAT serum level <11 µM (50 mg·dL<sup>-1</sup>) and/or a proteinase inhibitor genotype ZZ, SZ or compound heterozygotes or homozygotes of other rare deficient variants. Assessments at baseline and during the yearly follow-up visits include lung function testing (spirometry, body plethysmography and diffusing capacity of the lung), exercise capacity, blood tests and questionnaires (symptoms, quality of life and physical activity). To ensure correct data collection, there will be designated investigator staff to document the data in the case report form. All data will be reviewed by the EARCO database manager. The EARCO Registry aims to understand the natural history and prognosis of AATD better with the goal to create and validate prognostic tools to support medical decision-making."

    "title": "Adaptive NKG2C+ natural killer cells are related to exacerbations and nutritional abnormalities in COPD patients.",
    "abstract": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic and often progressive disorder with a heterogeneous presentation and frequent systemic manifestations. Several aspects like persistence in smoking habit, continuous exacerbations, alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency and inflammatory-immune response, are involved in the pathophysiology and progression of the disease. However, the role of natural killer (NK) cells remains controversial. Otherwise, human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection has been reported to induce an adaptive differentiation and expansion of an NK cell subset which carries the CD94/NKG2C receptor, which may contribute to an upset immune defense. For these reasons, our objective is to assess the distribution of NK cells and their subset in COPD patients and some of its phenotypes. Peripheral blood samples were obtained from 66 COPD patients. HCMV serology and the proportions of total NK cells and the NKG2C+ and NKG2A+ subsets were evaluated by flow cytometry. The NKG2C genotype was also assessed. Eighty-eight per cent of COPD patients were HCMV(+), and the proportions of total NK cells were higher in patients with severe-very severe airway obstruction than in those with only mild-moderate involvement. There were no differences in the proportions of NKG2C+ cells between controls and COPD, either among COPD patients classified by severity of the disease. However, the percentage of NKG2C+ cells were higher in COPD patients with frequent exacerbations than in occasional exacerbators, and higher in cases with reduced lean mass (Fat free mass index) than in those with normal nutritional status. These results suggest a relationship between levels of NKG2C+ cells in COPD patients and clinical variables closely linked to a poor/worse prognosis."

    "abstract": "Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a rare and underdiagnosed genetic predisposition for COPD and emphysema and other conditions, including liver disease. Although there have been improvements in terms of awareness of AATD and understanding of its treatment in recent years, current challenges center on optimizing detection and management of patients with AATD, and improving access to intravenous (IV) AAT therapy - the only available pharmacological intervention that can slow disease progression. However, as an orphan disease with geographically dispersed patients, international cooperation is essential to address these issues. To achieve this, new European initiatives in the form of the European Reference Network for Rare Lung Diseases (ERN-LUNG) and the European Alpha-1 Research Collaboration (EARCO) have been established. These organizations are striving to address the current challenges in AATD, and provide a new platform for future research efforts in AATD. The first objectives of ERN-LUNG are to establish a quality control program for European AATD laboratories and create a disease management program for AATD, following the success of such programs in the United States. The main purpose of EARCO is to create a pan-European registry, with the aim of understanding the natural history of the disease and supporting the development of new treatment modalities in AATD and access to AAT therapy. Going further, other patient-centric initiatives involve improving the convenience of intravenous AAT therapy infusions through extended-interval dosing and self-administration. The present review will discuss the implementation of these initiatives and their potential contribution to the optimization of patient care in AATD."

    "abstract": "Human cells express large amounts of different proteins continuously that must fold into well-defined structures that need to remain correctly folded and assemble in order to ensure their cellular and biological functions. The integrity of this protein balance/homeostasis, also named proteostasis, is maintained by the proteostasis network (PN). This integrated biological system, which comprises about 2000 proteins (chaperones, folding enzymes, degradation components), control and coordinate protein synthesis folding and localization, conformational maintenance, and degradation. This network is particularly challenged by mutations such as those found in genetic diseases, because of the inability of an altered peptide sequence to properly engage PN components that trigger misfolding and loss of function. Thus, deletions found in the ΔF508 variant of the Cystic Fibrosis (CF) transmembrane regulator (CFTR) triggering CF or missense mutations found in the Z variant of Alpha 1-Antitrypsin deficiency (AATD), leading to lung and liver diseases, can accelerate misfolding and/or generate aggregates. Conversely to CF variants, for which three correctors are already approved (ivacaftor, lumacaftor/ivacaftor, and most recently tezacaftor/ivacaftor), there are limited therapeutic options for AATD. Therefore, a more detailed understanding of the PN components governing AAT variant biogenesis and their manipulation by pharmacological intervention could delay, or even better, avoid the onset of AATD-related pathologies."

    "abstract": "α<sub>1</sub>-Antitrypsin (A1AT) deficiency predisposes patients to pulmonary disease due to inadequate protection against human neutrophil elastase released during inflammatory responses. A1AT deficiency is caused by homozygosity or compound heterozygosity for A1AT variants; individuals with A1AT deficiency most commonly have at least one Z variant allele (c.1096G > A (Glu366Lys)). Null variants that result in complete absence of A1AT in the plasma are much rarer. With one recent exception, all reported A1AT variants are characterized by a single pathogenic variant. An 8 years old patient from Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, was investigated for A1AT deficiency. His A1AT phenotype was determined to be M (wild type)/Null by isoelectric focusing (IEF) but M/Z by targeted genotyping. Gene sequencing revealed two heterozygous variants: Z and Ile100Asn (c.299 T > A). The Ile100Asn substitution is predicted to disrupt the secondary structure of an α-helix in which it resides and the neighbouring tertiary structure, resulting in intracellular degradation of A1AT prior to hepatocyte secretion. Family testing was conducted to verify potential inheritance of an A1AT allele carrying the two mutations in cis, as this arrangement of the mutations would explain \"Z\" detection by genotyping but not by IEF. Molecular modeling was used to assess the effect of the variants on A1AT structure and stability. Carrier status for a novel variant Null<sub>Canada</sub> with in cis mutations (c.[299 T > A;1096G > A], p.[(Ileu100Asn;Glu366Lys)]) was confirmed. A sibling was identified as having A1AT deficiency on the basis of compound heterozygosity for two alleles: Null<sub>Canada</sub> and the common Z allele. A separate pedigree from the Maritimes was subsequently recognized as carrying Null<sub>Canada</sub>. In cis mutations such as Null<sub>Canada</sub> may be more common than previously described due to failure to detect such mutations using historical testing methods. Combined approaches that include gene sequencing and segregation studies allow recognition of rare A1AT variants, including in cis mutations."

A retrospective observational cohort study of RA-BR in RTX or TNFi-treated RA patients from two UK centres over 10 years. BR was assessed using number of infective exacerbation/year. Respiratory survival was measured from therapy initiation to discontinuation either due to lung exacerbation or lung-related deaths. Of 800 RTX-treated RA patients, 68 had RA-BR (prevalence 8.5%). Post-RTX, new BR was diagnosed in 3/735 patients (incidence 0.4%). At 12 months post-Cycle 1 RTX, 21/68 (31%) patients had fewer exacerbations than the year pre-RTX, 36/68 (53%) remained stable and 11/68 (16%) had increased exacerbations. The rates of exacerbation improved after Cycle 2 and stabilized up to 5 cycles. Of patients who received ≥2 RTX cycles (n = 60), increased exacerbations occurred in 7/60 (12%) and were associated with low IgG, aspergillosis and concurrent alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency. Overall, 8/68 (11.8%) patients discontinued RTX while 15/46 (32.6%) discontinued TNFi due to respiratory causes. The adjusted 5-year respiratory survival was better in RTX-treated compared with TNFi-treated RA-BR patients; HR 0.40 (95% CI 0.17, 0.96); P =0.041. The majority of RTX-treated RA-BR patients had stable/improved pulmonary symptoms in this long-term follow-up. In isolated cases, worsening of exacerbation had definable causes. Rates of discontinuation due to adverse lung outcomes were better for RTX than a matched TNFi cohort. RTX is an acceptable therapeutic choice for RA-BR if a biologic is needed."

To understand this further, the aim of this study was to investigate whether AATD presents with altered neutrophil characteristics, due to the specific lack of plasma AAT, compared with non-AATD COPD.This study focussed on the neutrophil plasma membrane and, by use of label-free tandem mass spectrometry, the proteome of the neutrophil membrane was compared in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV<sub>1</sub>)-matched AATD, non-AATD COPD and in AATD patients receiving weekly AAT augmentation therapy (n=6 patients per cohort). Altered protein expression in AATD was confirmed by Western blot, ELISA and fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis.The neutrophil membrane proteome in AATD differed significantly from that of COPD as demonstrated by increased abundance and activity of primary granule proteins including neutrophil elastase on the cell surface in AATD. The signalling mechanism underlying increased degranulation involved Rac2 activation, subsequently resulting in proteinase-activated receptor 2 activation by serine proteinases and enhanced reactive oxygen species production. <i>In vitro</i> and <i>ex vivo</i>, AAT reduced primary granule release and the described plasma membrane variance was resolved post-AAT augmentation therapy <i>in vivo</i>, the effects of which significantly altered the AATD neutrophil membrane proteome to that of a non-AATD COPD cell.These results provide strong insight into the mechanism of neutrophil driven airways disease associated with AATD.

Initial evaluation and annual follow-up measurement of lung function, including post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 s and gas transfer inform on disease progression. Lung densitometry is the most sensitive measure of emphysema progression, but must not be use in the follow-up of patients in routine clinical practice. The exogenous administration of purified human serum-derived AAT is the only approved specific treatment for AATD in PiZZ. AAT augmentation therapy is not recommended in PiSZ, PiMZ or current smokers of any protein phenotype, or in patients with hepatic disease. Lung volume reduction and endoscopic bronchial valve placement are useful in selected patients, whereas the survival benefit of lung transplant is unclear.

Many people with AATD-associated pulmonary emphysema remain undiagnosed and therefore without access to care and counselling specific to the disease. AAT augmentation therapy is available and consists of i.v. infusions of exogenous AAT protein harvested from pooled blood products. Its clinical efficacy has been the subject of some debate and the use of AAT augmentation therapy was recently permitted by regulators in Australia and New Zealand, although treatment is not presently subsidized by the government in either country. The purpose of this position statement is to review the evidence for diagnosis and treatment of AATD-related lung disease with reference to the Australian and New Zealand population. The clinical efficacy and adverse events of AAT augmentation therapy were evaluated by a systematic review, and the GRADE process was employed to move from evidence to recommendation. Other sections address the wide range of issues to be considered in the care of the individual with AATD-related lung disease: when and how to test for AATD, changing diagnostic techniques, monitoring of progression, disease in heterozygous AATD and pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapy including surgical options for severe disease. Consideration is also given to broader issues in AATD that respiratory healthcare staff may encounter: genetic counselling, patient support groups, monitoring for liver disease and the need to establish national registries for people with AATD in Australia and New Zealand."

    "abstract": "Worldwide, patients are tested for acute and chronic diseases using a series of basic blood assays. The most common liver tests are serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), also called transaminases. These tests are indicators of hepatocellular injury and their increase requires further investigations. The aim of this descriptive review is to highlight and remind the importance of liver transaminases in daily practice. A systematic literature search of the main international databases was performed. We looked for papers that involved transaminases, either in the normal range or in case of increased level and focused on their use in clinical practice. A narrative review of this topic was written. Multiple studies have demonstrated that the presence of an elevated ALT was associated with increased liver-related mortality. The normal ALT level ranges from 29 to 33 IU/L in males and 19 to 25 IU/L in females. The investigations imposed by a high level of transaminases includes testing for viral hepatitis A, B, C and E, assessment for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic liver disease, screening for autoimmune hepatitis, hemochromatosis, Wilson's disease and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. Hepatotoxic drugs consumption also should be excluded. Furthermore, the utility of transaminases is evident in the assessment of the outcome after treatment of each specific liver disease. Beside the role in the first diagnostic step of liver injuries, the utility of liver transaminases is also maintained during the follow-up of liver diseases and in their prognostic assessment."

The aim of this study was to investigate whether AAT binding to plasma constituents could regulate their activation, and in AATD, exploit this binding event to better understand the condition and uncover novel biomarkers of therapeutic efficacy. To isolate AAT linker proteins, plasma samples were separated by size exclusion chromatography, followed by co-immunoprecipitation. AAT binding proteins were identified by mass spectrometry. Complement turnover and activation was determined by ELISA measurement of C3, C3a and C3d levels in plasma of healthy controls (n=15), AATD (n=51), non-AATD patients with obstructive airway disease (n=10) and AATD patients post AAT augmentation therapy (n=5). Direct binding of complement C3 to AAT was identified in vivo and in vitro. Compared with healthy controls, a breakdown product of C3, C3d, was increased in AATD (0.04 µg/mL vs 1.96 µg/mL, p=0.0002), with a significant correlation between radiographic pulmonary emphysema and plasma levels of C3d (R<sup>2</sup>=0.37, p=0.001). In vivo, AAT augmentation therapy significantly reduced plasma levels of C3d in comparison to patients not receiving AAT therapy (0.15 µg/mL vs 2.18 µg/mL, respectively, p=0.001). Results highlight the immune-modulatory impact of AAT on the complement system, involving an important potential role for complement activation in disease pathogenesis in AATD. The association between plasma C3d levels and pulmonary disease severity, that decrease in response to AAT augmentation therapy, supports the exploration of C3d as a candidate biomarker of therapeutic efficacy in AATD."

    "abstract": "Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) is a product of SERPINA1 gene mainly expressed by hepatocytes. Clinically relevant mutations in the SERPINA1 gene, such as Z (Glu342Lys), results in an expression of misfolded AAT protein having high propensity to polymerize, accumulate in hepatocytes and thus to enhance a risk for hepatocyte damage and subsequent liver disease. So far, the relationship between the Z-AAT accumulation and liver cell damage remains not completely understood. We present three-dimensional organoid culture systems, as a novel tool for modeling Z-AAT-related liver diseases. We have established liver organoids from liver biopsies of patients with homozygous (ZZ) and heterozygous (MZ) deficiency and normal (MM) genotypes of AAT. The features of these organoid models were characterized by analyzing AAT protein secretion and intracellular aggregation in MZ and ZZ genotypes as well as SERPINA1 expression in differentiated cultures. Transcriptional analysis of differentiated organoid cultures by RNA-Seq showed hepatocyte-specific gene expression profile. Genes, such as ALB, APOB, CYP3A4 and SERPINA1, were validated and confirmed through quantitative-PCR analysis. The organoids from MZ and ZZ cases showed intracellular aggregation and lower secretion of AAT protein, and lower expression of ALB and APOB, as typically seen in hepatocytes from Z-AAT deficiency patients. Furthermore, organoids responded to external stimulus. Treatment with oncostatin M, a well-known inducer of SERPINA1, increased expression of the full-length transcripts (AAT-1C) as well as the short transcript of AAT (AAT-ST1C4). Liver organoid model recapitulates the key features of Z-AAT deficiency and provides a useful tool for disease modeling."

The traditional algorithm for laboratory testing of AATD involves the analysis of AAT concentrations (nephelometry), phenotyping (isoelectric focusing, IEF), and genotyping (polymerase chain reaction, PCR); in selected cases, full sequencing of the SERPINA1 gene can be undertaken. New technologies arise that may make diagnosis easier and faster. We developed and evaluated a new diagnostic algorithm based on Luminex xMAP (multi-analyte profiling) technology using Progenika A1AT Genotyping Test. In an initial learning phase, 1979 samples from individuals suspected of having AATD were examined by both, a traditional and a \"new\" algorithm. In a second phase, 1133 samples were analyzed with the Luminex xMAP only. By introducing a Luminex xMAP based algorithm, we were able to simultaneously identify 14 mutations in SERPINA1 gene (instead of two- S and Z-by using our old algorithm). Although the quantity of IEF assays remained unchanged, the nephelometric measurements and sequencing were reduced by 79% and 63.4%, respectively. The new method is convenient, fast and user-friendly. The application of the Luminex xMAP technology can simplify and shorten the diagnostic workup of patients with suspected AATD."

In this study, we selected small molecules with the potential to bind mutant alpha 1-antitrypsin (Z-variant) to inhibit its accumulation in hepatocytes. We used molecular docking to select candidate compounds that were validated in cell and animal models of disease. A crystal structure of polymerized alpha 1-antitrypsin molecule was used as the basis for docking 139,735 compounds. Effects of the top scoring compounds were investigated in a cell model that stably expresses Z-variant alpha 1-antitrypsin and in PiZ mice expressing Z-variant human alpha 1-antitrypsin (Z-hAAT), encoded by SERPINA1*E342K. 4','5-(Methylenedioxy)-2-nitrocinnamic acid was predicted to bind cleaved alpha 1-antitrypsin at the polymerization interface, and observed to co-localize with Z-hAAT, increase Z-hAAT degradation, inhibit intracellular accumulation of Z-hAAT, and alleviate liver fibrosis."

    "abstract": "Physiological status and pathological changes in an individual can be captured by metabolic state that reflects the influence of both genetic variants and environmental factors such as diet, lifestyle and gut microbiome. The totality of environmental exposure throughout lifetime - i.e., exposome - is difficult to measure with current technologies. However, targeted measurement of exogenous chemicals and untargeted profiling of endogenous metabolites have been widely used to discover biomarkers of pathophysiologic changes and to understand functional impacts of genetic variants. To investigate the coverage of chemical space and interindividual variation related to demographic and pathological conditions, we profiled 169 plasma samples using an untargeted metabolomics platform. On average, 1,009 metabolites were quantified in each individual (range 906 - 1,038) out of 1,244 total chemical compounds detected in our cohort. Of note, age was positively correlated with the total number of detected metabolites in both males and females. Using the robust Qn estimator, we found metabolite outliers in each sample (mean 22, range from 7 to 86). A total of 50 metabolites were outliers in a patient with phenylketonuria including the ones known for phenylalanine pathway suggesting multiple metabolic pathways perturbed in this patient. The largest number of outliers (N=86) was found in a 5-year-old boy with alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency who were waiting for liver transplantation due to cirrhosis. Xenobiotics including drugs, diets and environmental chemicals were significantly correlated with diverse endogenous metabolites and the use of antibiotics significantly changed gut microbial products detected in host circulation. Several challenges such as annotation of features, reference range and variance for each feature per age group and gender, and population scale reference datasets need to be addressed; however, untargeted metabolomics could be immediately deployed as a biomarker discovery platform and to evaluate the impact of genomic variants and exposures on metabolic pathways for some diseases."

    "abstract": "Chronic lung disease accounts for a significant global burden with respect to death, disability, and health-care costs. Due to the heterogeneous nature and limited treatment options for these diseases, it is imperative that the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the disease pathophysiology are further understood. The lung is a complex organ with a diverse cell population, and each cell type will likely have different roles in disease initiation, progression, and resolution. The effectiveness of a given therapeutic agent may depend on the net effect on each of these cell types. Over the past decade, it has been established that endoplasmic reticulum stress and the unfolded protein response are involved in the development of several chronic lung diseases. These conserved cellular pathways are important for maintaining cellular proteostasis, but their aberrant activation can result in pathology. This review discusses the current understanding of endoplasmic reticulum stress and the unfolded protein response at the cellular level in the development and progression of various chronic lung diseases. We highlight the need for increased understanding of the specific cellular contributions of unfolded protein response activation to these pathologies and suggest that the development of cell-specific targeted therapies is likely required to further decrease disease progression and to promote resolution of chronic lung disease."

    "abstract": "Diacylglycerol kinases (DGKs) play a key role in phosphoinositide signaling by removing diacylglycerol and generating phosphatidic acid. Besides the well-documented role of DGKα and DGKζ as negative regulators of lymphocyte responses, a robust body of literature points to those enzymes, and specifically DGKα, as crucial regulators of leukocyte function. Upon neutrophil stimulation, DGKα activation is necessary for migration and a productive response. The role of DGKα in neutrophils is evidenced by its aberrant behavior in juvenile periodontitis patients, which express an inactive DGKα transcript. Together with in vitro experiments, this suggests that DGKs may represent potential therapeutic targets for disorders where inflammation, and neutrophils in particular, plays a major role. In this paper we focus on obstructive respiratory diseases, including asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but also rare genetic diseases such as alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency. Indeed, the biological role of DGKα is understudied outside the T lymphocyte field. The recent wave of research aiming to develop novel and specific inhibitors as well as KO mice will allow a better understanding of DGK's role in neutrophilic inflammation. Better knowledge and pharmacologic tools may also allow DGK to move from the laboratory bench to clinical trials."

The current patient, with known AATD, initially presented with nausea, vomiting and headache secondary to Listeria monocytogenes rhombencephalitis. Further on, he developed respiratory insufficiency due to probable invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. Diagnostic work-up could not show any arguments for an underlying immunodeficiency or malignancy. The consecutive course of two rare invasive infections in a healthy individual posed the hypothesis if the underlying AATD could be considered a possible trigger for infections. Indirect clinical observations in literature indeed support this link and in addition, two possible pathophysiological pathways might explain the higher susceptibility for infections in AATD patients. First, alveolar macrophages are dysfunctional in AATD patients leading to a lower apoptotic clearance of bacteria and other (mostly intracellular) pathogens. Secondly, a lower release and lower function of tumour necrosis factor α (TNFα) is seen in alfa-1-antitrypsin depletion, priming the path to more frequent infections, a mechanism that is similar in anti-TNFα treated patients. This case is the first to report on severe or invasive infections related to AATD in humans."

Targets for pharmacological treatments include airway smooth muscle contraction, inflammation, mucus production, alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency and respiratory infection. Inhaled bronchodilators are the mainstay, with methylxanthines as secondary choice agents. Anti-inflammatory therapy can be administered as corticosteroids, phosphodiesterase inhibitor, and long-term macrolides such as azithromycin. Mucus production is addressed by use of mucolytics. In some countries, alpha-1-antitrypsin augmentation therapy is available for severe alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency. The treatment of bacterial infection and/or colonization can be attempted with antibiotics; there is a dire need for effective anti-viral agents for the common viruses causing exacerbations of COPD. Since clinicians need to choose medications for their individual patients, algorithms for how to choose and change medication are increasingly being presented with more elements of treatable traits and personalized medicine."

Therefore, we assessed iron metabolism and variants in the Homeostatic Iron Regulator gene (<i>HFE</i>) as the major cause of hereditary iron overload in a large cohort of Pi*ZZ subjects without liver comorbidities. The human cohort comprised of 409 Pi*ZZ individuals and 254 subjects without evidence of an AAT mutation who were recruited from ten European countries. All underwent a comprehensive work-up and transient elastography to determine liver stiffness measurements (LSM). The corresponding mouse models (Pi*Z overexpressors, <i>HFE</i> knockouts, and double transgenic [DTg] mice) were used to evaluate the impact of mild iron overload on Pi*Z-induced liver injury. Compared to Pi*Z non-carriers, Pi*ZZ individuals had elevated serum iron, transferrin saturation, and ferritin levels, but relevant iron overload was rare. All these parameters were higher in individuals with signs of significant liver fibrosis (LSM ≥ 7.1 kPa) compared to those without signs of significant liver fibrosis. <i>HFE</i> knockout and DTg mice displayed similar extent of iron overload and of fibrosis. Loss of <i>HFE</i> did not alter the extent of AAT accumulation. In Pi*ZZ individuals, presence of <i>HFE</i> mutations was not associated with more severe liver fibrosis. Taken together, Pi*ZZ individuals display minor alterations in serum iron parameters. Neither mild iron overload seen in these individuals nor the presence of <i>HFE</i> mutations (<i>C282Y</i> and <i>H63D</i>) constitute a major contributor to liver fibrosis development."

These treatments involve weekly injections of patients with purified plasma-derived A1AT. Such therapies can be extremely expensive and rely on plasma donors. Hence, large-scale production of recombinant A1AT (rA1AT) could greatly benefit these patients, as it could decrease the cost of treatments, reduce biosafety concerns and ensure quantitative and qualitative controls of the protein. In this report, we sought to produce α2,6-sialylated rA1AT with our cumate-inducible stable CHO pool expression system. Our different CHO pools could reach volumetric productivities of 1,2 g/L. The human α2,6-sialyltransferase was stably expressed in these cells in order to mimic elevated α2,6-sialylation levels of native A1AT protein. Sialylation of the recombinant protein was stable over the duration of the fed-batch production phase and was higher in a pool where cells were sorted and enriched by FACS based on cell-surface α2,6-sialylation. Addition of ManNAc to the cell culture media during production enhanced both α2,3 and α2,6 A1AT sialylation levels whereas addition of 2F-peracetylfucose potently inhibited fucosylation of the protein. Finally, we demonstrated that rA1AT proteins exhibited human neutrophil elastase inhibitory activities similar to the commercial human plasma-derived A1AT."

Particularly, in lung disease, rigid inclusion/exclusion criteria can limit the generalizability of pivotal trial data. Noninterventional studies (NIS), conducted through the well-established mechanism of patient registries, are undervalued as a means to close data gaps left by RCTs by providing essential data that can guide patient care at different levels from clinical decision-making to health-care policy. While NIS contribute valuable data in all disease areas, their importance in rare diseases cannot be underestimated. In respiratory disease, registries have been essential in understanding the natural history and different phenotypes of rare conditions, such as alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency, cystic fibrosis, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Importantly, additional therapeutic outcome data were generated. While measures for enhancing data quality in RCTs have evolved significantly, the approach and effectiveness of registries is variable. Within this article, we review the contribution of registries to pulmonary disease and make recommendations for their effective management. Additionally, we assess limitations of registry data as well as challenges to registry operation, including the impact of the European Union General Data Protection Regulation."

It is often unclear whether this finding is a nonspecific consequence of cirrhosis or is indicative of an underlying alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency (A1ATD) contributing to the cirrhosis. In this study, explanted livers were retrospectively evaluated for histopathology (including PASD status with confirmatory alpha-1-antitrypsin [A1AT] immunohistochemistry [IHC]), and chart review provided etiology of liver failure and general clinical parameters. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to detect A1AT genotype (SERPINA1 S and Z alleles) by melting curve analysis on liver explant tissue from selected cases. Of 196 explanted livers, 21 (11%) had PASD+ globules, which were significantly enriched in patients with a clinical diagnosis of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH; 47%) compared with other causes (P < 0.001). IHC confirmed all PASD+ globules were A1AT+, with 20 of 21 cases demonstrating diffuse A1AT staining. In an expanded NASH cohort, 42% (14/33) of explants had PASD+ globules, 92% of which were homozygous (n = 1) or heterozygous (n = 11) for the SERPINA1 Z allele, corresponding to nearly 40% of all NASH patients. Overall, the Z allele was present in 10% of all tested liver explants, with 85% of PASD+ cases genotyping homozygous (n = 2) or heterozygous (n = 20), which is far in excess of the estimated 2% in the general population. These results indicate PASD+ A1AT globules (with confirmatory genotyping showing at least 1 Z allele) are commonly observed in NASH, suggesting a synergistic relationship toward liver fibrosis. In addition, the high frequency of SERPINA1 Z alleles in liver transplantation patients supports the utility of pretransplant genotyping."

Laboratory testing in suspected A1AT deficiency involves quantifying serum A1AT concentration and identification of specific alleles by genotyping and phenotyping. The aim of this report was to present a case of the null allele carrier with consequent genotype/phenotype/concentration discrepancies and potential misclassification of the Z variant in a 42-year-old white man presenting with symptoms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Serum A1AT concentration was measured using an immunoturbidimetric assay. A1AT phenotype was determined using isoelectric focusing followed with immunofixation (IEF-IF). Genotyping specifically for the S and Z allele was performed by melting curve analysis using real-time PCR and checked by an alternative PCR-RFLP method. Genotype/phenotype ambiguity and discrepancy were amended using gene sequencing. Laboratory testing revealed highly reduced A1AT concentration (less than 0.30 g/L), mild to moderate deficient genotype (Pi*Z allele: M/Z and Pi*S allele: M/M) and severe deficient Z homozygous phenotype (Pi ZZ). After repeated sampling, the same discordant results were verified by these tests. Further sequencing revealed two clinically relevant and defective variants: rs199422210 (a rare null allele) and rs28929474 (the Z allele). Due to inability of genotyping kit probes to detect null/Z allele combination (which mimics the Pi ZZ phenotype), our patient was misclassified as mild to moderate deficient Pi*MZ heterozygote. In all unclear cases, whole-gene sequencing is highly recommended in order to determine definitive cause of A1AT deficiency."

Using data from 1283 children in the MAL-ED (Etiology, Risk Factors, and Interactions of Enteric Infections and Malnutrition and the Consequences for Child Health) birth cohort we evaluated the risk of anemia, low retinol, zinc, and ferritin, and high transferrin receptor (TfR) at 15 mo.

Nutrient intakes from complementary foods were quantified monthly from 9 to 15 mo and densities were averaged for analyses. α-1-Acid glycoprotein at 15 mo characterized systemic inflammation. Relations between variables were modeled using a Bayesian network. A greater risk of anemia was associated with LMZ [1.15 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.31)] and MPO [1.16 (1.01, 1.34)].

However, MPO was associated with a lower risk of high transferrin receptor [0.86 (0.74, 0.98)], NEO with a lower risk of low retinol [0.75 (0.62, 0.89)], and AAT with a lower risk of low plasma zinc [0.83 (0.70, 0.99)]. Greater nutrient intake densities (vitamins A and B6, calcium, protein, and zinc) were negatively associated with EED. Inverse associations between nutrient densities and micronutrient deficiency largely disappeared after adjustment for EED, suggesting that EED mediates these associations. EED is independently associated with an increased risk of low ferritin, low retinol, and anemia. Greater nutrient density from complementary foods may reduce EED, and the control of micronutrient deficiencies may require control of EED."

    "title": "An analysis of the degree of concordance among international guidelines regarding alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency.",
    "abstract": "Practice guidelines (PGs) attempt to standardize practice to optimize care. For uncommon lung diseases like alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD), a paucity of definitive studies and geographic variation in prevalence may hamper guideline generation. The current study assembled and assesses the degree of concordance among available PGs regarding AATD. To assess concordance, 15 eligible guidelines focused on AATD were evaluated regarding recommendations surrounding 24 key clinical issues. A Delphi process achieved consensus on ratings for each statement among 3 reviewers. Agreement was quantified as the proportion of guideline comparisons with a matching rating. The overall level of agreement was 47% (1190/2520 comparisons). The overall \"affirmative agreement percentage\" (ie, when guidelines agreed in endorsing a practice), was 42% (501/1190 comparisons). The agreement for individual clinical statements ranged from 26% to 75%. A broad consensus was seen in the recommendation to test all patients with a history of fixed obstruction on pulmonary function testing (either from asthma or COPD). Given that AATD is an under-recognized disease and that diagnosis often occurs at a late stage, the authors are encouraged by this consensus. Where overall the guidelines were less explicit was when to refer to a specialist or AATD center. Deciding on a treatment strategy requires a thorough understanding of the alpha 1 serum level, genotype, pulmonary function testing, and imaging, and therefore the authors feel that all patients would benefit from a specialty referral if the diagnosis of AATD is being considered. Available guidelines regarding AATD frequently disagreed in management recommendations. Possible explanations for discordance include differences in regional prevalence, availability of augmentation therapy, and insurance environments. Attempts to harmonize the various guidelines by empaneling a broadly representative international group of disease experts should be considered for AATD. Similar comparisons among guidelines for other diseases are recommended."

    "abstract": "Biomarkers, including blood eosinophils (EoS) and fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), may affect omalizumab outcomes in allergic asthma, but evidence in the literature remains mixed. This study assessed omalizumab outcomes in real-world patients with allergic asthma stratified by pretreatment biomarker levels. Patients with allergic asthma aged ≥12 years initiated on omalizumab with ≥12 months of data after index were identified in the Allergy Partners electronic medical records (2007-2018). Patients with ≥1 diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in combination with ≥10 pack-years of smoking, cystic fibrosis, Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, bronchiectasis, interstitial lung disease, and sarcoidosis in the 12 months before or after index were excluded. Patients were stratified by pretreatment EoS (≥/<300 cells/μL) and FeNO (≥/<25 parts per billion). Outcomes, including Asthma Control Test (ACT) scores, forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV<sub>1</sub>), and FEV<sub>1</sub> as a percentage of predicted value (FEV<sub>1</sub>% predicted), were compared using generalized estimating equations at 6 and 12 months after versus before index date in stratified patients with outcome measures available at both time periods. A total of 77 and 86 patients were stratified into the high and low EoS strata, respectively, and 56 patients into each of the intermediate-high and low FeNO strata. Compared with 6 months before index, mean difference (MD) in ACT scores at 6 months after index reached the minimally important difference of ≥3 points in high (MD = 3.75; 95% CI, 2.05-5.45) and low (MD = 4.56; 95% CI, 2.86-6.26) EoS, as well in the intermediate-high (MD = 3.75; 95% CI, 1.95-5.55) and low (MD = 3.55; 95% CI, 1.53-5.57) FeNO strata. Statistically significant improvements in mean FEV<sub>1</sub> were observed in the high EoS (MD = 0.22 L/s; 95% CI, 0.08-0.35 L/s) and intermediate-high FeNO (MD = 0.13 L/s; 95% CI, 0.03-0.24 L/s) strata but not in the lower strata. In terms of mean FEV<sub>1</sub>% predicted, a statistically significant improvement was observed in high EoS stratum (MD = 4.95%; 95% CI, 0.60%-9.30%). Results that compared 12 months after versus before index date were similar. Omalizumab was associated with statistically significant improvements in ACT scores largely reaching or exceeding minimally important difference across biomarker levels and with a statistically significant improvement in lung function more evident in high biomarker strata. Although response varied by biomarkers for some outcomes, all strata indicated improvements on ≥1 measure. Real-world patients with allergic asthma could benefit from omalizumab regardless of pretreatment biomarker levels, suggesting that pretreatment biomarker levels might not inform response."

    "abstract": "Domino liver transplantation (DLT) using liver allografts from patients with metabolic disorders enhances organ utilization. Short- and long-term course and outcome of these patients can impact the decision to offer this procedure to patients, especially those with diseases that can potentially be cured with liver transplant. We reviewed the outcomes of DLT from maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) patients in our large academic pediatric and adult transplant program. All patients receiving DLT were analyzed retrospectively with a minimum of one-year follow-up period for patient and donor characteristics, early and late postoperative complications and patient and graft survival with their MSUD donors in terms of age, weight, MELD/PELD scores, cold ischemia time, postoperative leucine levels, and peak ALT (alanine aminotransferase) levels during the first 48 postoperative hours. Between 2006 and May 2019, 21 patients underwent domino liver transplantation with live donor allografts from MSUD patients. Four patients transplanted for different metabolic diseases are focus of a separate report. Seventeen patients with minimum one-year follow-up period are reported herein. The indications were primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC, n = 4), congenital hepatic fibrosis (CHF, n = 2), alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (A-1 ATD, n = 2), progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC, n = 2), cystic fibrosis (n = 1), primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC, n = 1), neonatal hepatitis (n = 1), embryonal sarcoma (n = 1), Caroli disease (n = 1), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC, n = 1), and chronic rejection after liver transplantations for PSC (n = 1). All patients and grafts survived at median follow-up of 6.4 years (range 1.2-12.9 years). Median domino recipient age was 16.2 years (range 0.6-64.6 years) and median MSUD recipient age was 17.6 years (range 4.8-32.1 years). There were no vascular complications during the early postoperative period, one patient had portal vein thrombosis 3 years after DLT and a meso-Rex bypass was successfully performed. Small for size syndrome (SFSS) occurred in reduced left lobe DLT recipient and was managed successfully with conservative management. Biliary stricture developed in 2 patients and was resolved by stenting. Comparison between DLT and MSUD recipients' peak postoperative ALT results and PELD/MELD scores showed lower levels in DLT group (P-value <.05). Patient and graft survival in DLT from MSUD donors was excellent at short- and long-term follow-up. Metabolic functions have been normal in all recipients on a normal unrestricted protein diet. Ischemia preservation injury based on peak ALT was significantly decreased in DLT recipients. Domino transplantation from pediatric and adult recipients with selected metabolic diseases should be increasingly considered as an excellent option and alternative to deceased donor transplantation, thereby expanding the living donor pool. This, to date, is the largest world experience in DLT utilizing livers from patients with MSUD."

    "abstract": "Chronic physical illness is associated with significant vulnerability for emotional disorders. Some studies suggest anxiety and depression are common comorbidities in individuals with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD). Many aspects of AATD contribute to quality of life impairment. Delays in diagnosis, high costs of disease treatment, and inherited genetic risk add to the symptom burden of lung or liver disease to alter quality of life. Whether anxiety and depression independently contribute to quality of life impairment remains unproven. In this article, we aim to review current literature examining the impact of anxiety and depression on the quality of life of AATD-affected individuals. Multifaceted approaches may best meet the needs of a heterogeneous population and are the best future strategies to minimize these emotional impacts and assure highest quality of life possible. More research studies are needed to achieve this ambitious goal and make life of AATD-affected individuals better by minimizing the effects of anxiety and depression."

Liquid A1PI and Lyophilized A1PI had similar average mass (~52 kDa), and both forms exhibited glycoform patterns consistent with the known banding pattern of A1PI (dominated by the M6 and M4 bands, including deconvoluted masses). Both Liquid A1PI and Lyophilized A1PI yielded average percent purity values ranging from 96% to 99% and had active content ranging from 53 mg/mL to 59 mg/mL. The PK profile of Liquid A1PI was similar to Lyophilized A1PI. Safety assessments in rabbits showed good tolerability and no test article-related changes in mortality, clinical signs, clinical pathology, body weight, food consumption, or urinalysis parameters. Following immunodepletion of antibodies that recognize Lyophilized A1PI, there were no significant differences in the anti-drug titers among animals immunized with Lyophilized A1PI and Liquid A1PI (p > 0.05), indicating that no antibodies to neoantigens were generated. Liquid A1PI and Lyophilized A1PI have similar profiles with respect to biochemical characteristics, PK, safety and neoantigenicity."

    "abstract": "Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a genetic disorder associated to early onset emphysema, mainly imputable to Pi*ZZ genotype. In spite of the serious potential effects, many AATD individuals do not develop emphysema. To identify genes/variants potentially involved in emphysema development we studied 4 AATD families. Each family had at least one affected sibling with emphysema and one non-affected. Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) was performed on genomic DNA isolated from 9 individuals with AATD (4 affected/5 non-affected). Genetic variants confirmed at least in three families were prioritized using QueryOR and network analysis was used to verify enriched pathways. In affected subjects: 14 genes (57% immune-related) segregated in a recessive model and 21 (29% immune-related) in a dominant model. In non-affected subjects: 21 genes (43% immune-related) segregated in a recessive model and 50 (24% immune-related) in a dominant model. In affected siblings immune genes had an activating function, while where immune-suppressing in non-affected siblings involving antigen processing, MHC-I presentation, TCR and PD-1 signalling. This study describes possible genetic susceptibility factors for emphysema development in AATD, and suggests that gene variants involved in regulation of immune homeostasis and maintenance of self-tolerance contribute to the development or suppression of the disease."

    "abstract": "Although alpha-1 antitrypsin (A1AT) deficiency represents one of the most common genetically conditioned diseases in the population of Caucasian adult individuals, it is rarely diagnosed. Alpha-1 antitrypsin is an important component of the anti-proteolytic protection in the lungs. Individuals affected by the protein deficiency are exposed to a higher risk of developing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), emphysema or liver diseases. A 52-year-old farmer, non-smoker, spraying orchards since the age of 15 years, was admitted to the Department with dyspnea at rest and productive cough. He had a medical history of COPD, congestive heart failure, generalized emphysema of ten years' duration On admission the patient's general condition was satisfactory (fair). Physical examination showed symmetric expiratory wheezing over the upper and lower fields of the lungs with loss of vesicular murmur in the lower fields. Spirometry revealed a severe chronic bronchial obstruction, and an arterial blood gas test showed hypoxemia. Laboratory tests demonstrated an increased concentration of inflammatory markers. High resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the chest showed evidence of generalized emphysema, bronchiectasis and exacerbation of peribronchial inflammatory changes. Intensive anti-inflammatory, bronchodilator treatment and antibiotic therapy were implemented, which resulted in an optimal improvement of the patient's condition. Based on the whole clinical picture A1AT deficiency was suspected. Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, MZ phenotype, with 65 mg/dl concentration was diagnosed. Diagnostic tests for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency should always be considered in patients with emphysema or symptomatic COPD identified at an early age. In the described case the period between occurrence of clinical signs and establishing the diagnosis was ten years, which proves that there is a strong need to spread knowledge on A1AT among medical professionals. Otherwise, most of the patients will lose their chance of modifying their lifestyle or receiving proper treatment that could prevent the progression of changes in the lungs."

We postulated that inhalation of nebulised AAT would be an effective treatment.We randomly assigned 168 patients to receive twice-daily inhalations of 80 mg AAT solution or placebo for 50 weeks. Patients used an electronic diary to capture exacerbations. The primary endpoint was time from randomisation to the first event-based exacerbation. Secondary endpoints included change in the nature of the exacerbation as defined by the Anthonisen criteria. Safety was also assessed.Time to first moderate or severe exacerbation was a median of 112 days (interquartile range (IQR) 40-211 days) for AAT and 140 days (IQR 72-142 days) for placebo (p=0.0952). The mean yearly rate of all exacerbations was 3.12 in the AAT-treated group and 2.67 in the placebo group (p=0.31). More patients receiving AAT reported treatment-related treatment-emergent adverse events compared to placebo (57.5% <i>versus</i> 46.9%, respectively) and they were more likely to withdraw from the study. After the first year of the study, when modifications to the handling of the nebuliser were introduced, the rate of safety events in the AAT-treated group dropped to that of the placebo group.We conclude that in AATD patients with severe COPD and frequent exacerbations, AAT inhalation for 50 weeks showed no effect on time to first exacerbation but may have changed the pattern of the episodes."

In this work, for the first time, we proved by a proteomic investigation that adipose-derived (AD)-MSC-secretome contains alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT), the main elastase inhibitor in the lung, 72 other proteins involved in protease/antiprotease balance, and 46 proteins involved in the response to bacteria. By secretome fractionation, we proved that AAT is present both in the soluble fraction of secretome and aggregated and/or adsorbed on the surface of EVs, that can act as natural carriers promoting AAT in vivo stability and activity. To modulate secretome composition, AD-MSCs were cultured in different stimulating conditions, such as serum starvation or chemicals (IL-1β and/or dexamethasone) and the expression of the gene encoding for AAT was increased. By testing in vitro the anti-elastase activity of MSC-secretome, a dose-dependent effect was observed; chemical stimulation of AD-MSCs did not increase their secretome anti-elastase activity. Finally, MSC-secretome showed anti-bacterial activity on Gram-negative bacteria, especially for <i>K</i><i>lebsiella</i><i>pneumoniae</i>. These preliminary results, in addition to the already demonstrated immunomodulation, pave the way for the use of MSC-secretome in the treatment of AAT-deficiency lung diseases."

    "abstract": "A huge number of proteins that occur in the body have to be folded into a specific shape in order to become functional. Proteins are made up of chains of amino acids and the folding process is exquisitely complex. When this folding process is inhibited, the respective protein is referred to as being misfolded and nonfunctional. So the hypothesis that follows is in regard to the diseases that are caused by the misfolding of vital proteins and their reported relationship with thiamin metabolism. These diseases are termed proteopathies and there are at least 50 different conditions in which the mechanism is importantly related to a misfolded protein. In the brain, thiamin deficiency causes a cascade of events involving mild impairment of oxidative metabolism, neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, including the pathology of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases, all of which are examples of proteopathies. Prion diseases are fatal neurodegenerative disorders related to the conformational alteration of the prion protein (PrP C) into a pathogenic and protease-resistant isoform (PrPSc). The physiological form (PrP C) is a cell surface glycoprotein expressed mainly in the central nervous system. Despite numerous efforts to elucidate its role, the exact biological function remains unknown. Prion-induced diseases, due to the conformational change in the protein, are a global health problem, with lack of effective therapy and 100% mortality. Thiamin and its derivatives bind the prion protein and intermolecular actions have been noted between thiamin and other thiamin-binding proteins, although the exact importance of this is conjectural."

    "title": "Design and characterization of α1-antitrypsin variants for treatment of contact system-driven thromboinflammation.",
    "abstract": "The contact system produces the inflammatory peptide bradykinin and contributes to experimental thrombosis. C1 esterase-inhibitor (C1INH) deficiency or gain-of-function mutations in factor XII (FXII) cause hereditary angioedema, a life-threatening tissue swelling disease. C1INH is a relatively weak contact system enzyme inhibitor. Although α1-antitrypsin (α1AT) does not naturally inhibit contact system enzymes, a human mutation (M358R; α1AT-Pittsburgh) changes it into a powerful broad-spectrum enzyme inhibitor. It blocks the contact system, but also thrombin and activated protein C (APC), making it an unattractive candidate for therapeutic contact system blockade. We adapted the reactive center loop of α1AT-Pittsburgh (AIPR/S) to overcome these obstacles. Two α1AT variants (SMTR/S and SLLR/S) strongly inhibit plasma kallikrein, activated FXII, and plasmin. α1AT-SMTR/S no longer inhibits thrombin, but residually inhibits APC. In contrast, α1AT-SLLR/S residually inhibits thrombin, but no longer APC. Additional modification at the P1' position (S→V) eliminates residual inhibition of thrombin and APC for both variants, while retaining their properties as contact system inhibitors. Both α1AT-SMTR/V and -SLLR/V are superior to C1INH in reducing bradykinin production in plasma. Owing to their capacity to selectively block contact system-driven coagulation, both variants block vascular occlusion in an in vivo model for arterial thrombosis. Furthermore, both variants block acute carrageenan-induced tissue edema in mice. Finally, α1AT-SLLR/V, our most powerful candidate, suppresses epithelial leakage of the gut in a mouse model of colitis. Our findings confirm that redesign of α1AT strongly alters its inhibitory behavior and can be used for the treatment of contact system-mediated thrombosis and inflammation."

A 42-year-old male presented with sub-acute bilateral vision loss during an intensive care unit hospitalization following liver and kidney transplantations. On exam, this patient's best-corrected visual acuity was 20/80 in both eyes. There were bilateral descemetoceles inferotemporally in both eyes with overlying epithelial defects and dense surrounding punctate epithelial staining. The patient was initially treated with gatifloxacin drops and frequent lubricating ointment. Given the concern for impending perforation, cyanoacrylate glue with bandage contact lens was applied to both eyes. His best corrected visual acuity remained unchanged in the right eye and improved to 20/30 in the left eye. Upon medical stabilization, anterior lamellar graft was performed in the right eye, with plans for the same treatment in the left eye in the future. As A1AT is found in the tear film and is believed to play a role in regulating protease activity in the cornea, we hypothesize that this patient's A1AT deficiency exacerbated the progression of corneal ulceration leading to severe descemetocele formation."

    "abstract": "Alfa 1-antitrypsin deficiency is one of the most prevalent genetic diseases in the human being, sadly it is not a commonly suspected clinical entity. With more than 100 known mutations, those associated with hepatic disease are the Z homocygote allele mutations in the gene a1AT which occur in every 2000-3500 births. Opposing to the pulmonary disease, in which de sequelae are caused by the deficit of this protein which in turn fastens the enzymatic destruction of the airway microstructure, the hepatic compromise is secondary to the intracellular accumulation of the aberrant misfolded protein. This accumulation causes cellular damage, hepatitis, fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma through activation of a series of mechanisms which culminate in hepatocitary apoptosis, regeneration and chronic cellular injury. 9 cases of confirmed a1AT deficiency are presented, from different ages ranging from adolescence through elderly patients. Each of one of them with different clinical presentation going from asymptomatic liver enzyme elevations to transplanted cirrhosis in which the diagnosis was post procedural. We comment about the management of the chronic liver disease and the evolution of these patients through time in the liver clinic."

    "abstract": "α1-antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) remains the only readily identified genetic cause of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Furthermore, there is growing evidence that even a moderate deficiency increases the risk of lung disease among smokers. Despite these facts, the uptake of testing for AATD in at-risk populations remains low for many reasons, and a lack of clarity among clinicians regarding the most appropriate diagnostic techniques presents a major deterrent. This Personal View addresses the benefits of diagnosis, the technical basis of the available diagnostic methods, and possible clinical confounders for each test. We include a series of unusual cases encountered at our National Centre of Expertise to provide context. The topics covered should equip clinicians with the core knowledge required to confidently assess patients for AATD."

    "abstract": "Alpha 1 Antitrypsin (AAT) is a key serum proteinase inhibitor encoded by SERPINA1. Sequence variants of the gene can cause Alpha 1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (AATD), a condition associated with lung and liver disease. The majority of AATD cases are caused by the 'Z' and 'S' variants - single-nucleotide variations (SNVs) that result in amino acid substitutions of E342K and E264V. However, SERPINA1 is highly polymorphic, with numerous potentially clinically relevant variants reported. Novel variants continue to be discovered, and without reports of pathogenicity, it can be difficult for clinicians to determine the best course of treatment. We assessed the utility of next-generation sequencing (NGS) and predictive computational analysis to guide the diagnosis of patients suspected of having AATD. Blood samples on serum separator cards were submitted to the DNA<sub>1</sub> Advanced Screening Program (Biocerna LLC, Fulton, Maryland, USA) by physicians whose patients were suspected of having AATD. Laboratory analyses included quantification of serum AAT levels, qualitative analysis by isoelectric focusing, and targeted genotyping and NGS of the SERPINA1 gene. Molecular modeling software UCSF Chimera (University College of San Francisco, CA) was used to visualize the positions of amino acid changes as a result of rare/novel SNVs. Predictive software was used to assess the potential pathogenicity of these variants; methods included a support vector machine (SVM) program, PolyPhen-2 (Harvard University, Cambridge, MA), and FoldX (Centre for Genomic Regulation, Barcelona, Spain). Samples from 23 patients were analyzed; 21 rare/novel sequence variants were identified by NGS, including splice variants (n = 2), base pair deletions (n = 1), stop codon insertions (n = 2), and SNVs (n = 16). Computational modeling of protein structures caused by the novel SNVs showed that 8 were probably deleterious, and two were possibly deleterious. For the majority of probably/possibly deleterious SNVs (I50N, P289S, M385T, M221T, D341V, V210E, P369H, V333M and A142D), the mechanism is probably via disruption of the packed hydrophobic core of AAT. Several deleterious variants occurred in combination with more common deficiency alleles, resulting in very low AAT levels. NGS and computational modeling are useful tools that can facilitate earlier, more precise diagnosis, and consideration for AAT therapy in AATD."

We hypothesized that there might be an association between SERPINA1 gene polymorphisms and the risk of developing wheezing/school age asthma. To examine 10 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of SERPINA1 (rs6647, rs11832, rs17580, rs709932, rs1243160, rs2854254, rs8004738, rs17751769, rs28929470, and rs28929474) and relate them to childhood wheezing phenotypes and doctor-diagnosed asthma in the population-based Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) cohort. Wheeze data, reports of physician-diagnosed asthma and data on the SERPINA1 gene SNPs, were available for 7964 children. Binary logistic regression was used to assess the associations between allele prevalence and wheezing and asthma phenotypes. P values were adjusted to account for multiple hypotheses using the Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate. Only within a subgroup of children with asthma who had no prior diagnosis of preschool wheeze was there a trend for association between rs28929474 (Glu342Lys, Pi*Z causing AAT deficiency; P = .0058, adjusted P = .058). No SNP was associated with wheezing and asthma in those with preschool wheeze. Analyzed SNPs in SERPINA1 are not associated with wheezing/asthma phenotypes. Only rs28929474, the most common pathologic SNP (Pi*Z) in the SERPINA1 gene, might be associated with a risk of developing school-age asthma without exhibiting preschool wheeze."

But there is increasing evidence that AAT itself enhances host immunity against microbial pathogens and thus deficiency could compromise host protection. <b>Objectives:</b> The goal of this project is to determine if AAT could augment macrophage activity against non-tuberculous mycobacteria. <b>Methods:</b> We compared the ability of monocyte-derived macrophages cultured in autologous plasma that were obtained immediately before and soon after AAT infusion-given to individuals with AAT deficiency-to control an <i>ex vivo Mycobacterium intracellulare</i> infection. <b>Measurements and Main Results:</b> We found that compared to pre-AAT infused monocyte-derived macrophages plus plasma, macrophages, and contemporaneous plasma obtained after a session of AAT infusion were significantly better able to control <i>M. intracellulare</i> infection; the reduced bacterial burden was linked with greater phagosome-lysosome fusion and increased autophagosome formation/maturation, the latter due to AAT inhibition of both <i>M. intracellulare</i>-induced nuclear factor-kappa B activation and A20 expression. While there was a modest increase in apoptosis in the <i>M. intracellulare</i>-infected post-AAT infused macrophages and plasma, inhibiting caspase-3 in THP-1 cells, monocyte-derived macrophages, and alveolar macrophages unexpectedly reduced the <i>M. intracellulare</i> burden, indicating that apoptosis impairs macrophage control of <i>M. intracellulare</i> and that the host protective effects of AAT occurred despite inducing apoptosis. <b>Conclusion:</b> AAT augments macrophage control of <i>M. intracellulare</i> infection through enhancing phagosome-lysosome fusion and autophagy."

We aimed to define an association between extracellular mtDNA and clinical features of sarcoidosis.Extracellular mtDNA concentrations were measured using quantitative PCR for the human <i>MT-ATP6</i> gene in bronchoalveolar (BAL) and plasma samples from healthy controls and patients with sarcoidosis from The Yale Lung Repository; associations between <i>MT-ATP6</i> concentrations and Scadding stage, extrapulmonary disease and demographics were sought.

Genetic variations including single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of SERPINA1 are responsible for A1AT deficiency, but the characteristics of the SNPs are not well-understood. Here, we investigated the features of a rare SNP (F51S) of A1AT, which introduces an additional N-glycosylation site in the N-terminal region of A1AT. We evaluated the F51S variant compared with the wild-type (WT) A1AT with regard to expression in CHO-K1 cells, trypsin inhibitory activity, polymerization, and thermal stability. The recombinant F51S protein expressed in CHO-K1 cells was mostly retained inside cells. The F51S variant had trypsin inhibitory activity, but reduced thermal stability compared with the WT A1AT. The native acrylamide gel data showed that F51S tended to prevent polymerization of A1AT. The results of this study indicate that Phe51 and the surrounding hydrophobic residue cluster plays an important role in the conformation and secretion of A1AT and suggest the harmful effects of a rare F51S SNP in human health."

    "abstract": "Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) protects the lung by inhibiting neutrophil proteinases, but AAT has many other non-proteolytic functions that are anti-inflammatory, antiviral and homeostatic. Approximately 1 in 1600 to 1 in 5000 people have the homozygous Z mutation, which causes AAT misfolding, accumulation in (predominantly) liver cells and low circulating levels of AAT, leading to AAT deficiency (AATD). AATD is classically a disease of neutrophilic inflammation, with an aggressive and damaging innate immune response contributing to emphysema and other pathologies. AATD is one of the most common genetic disorders but considerably under-recognised. Most patients are diagnosed later in life, by which time they may have accumulated significant lung, liver and multisystem damage. Disease presentation is heterogeneous and not fully explained by deficiency levels alone or exposure to cigarette smoking. This suggests other factors influence AATD-associated pathological processes. Aging itself is associated with organ dysfunction, including emphysema and airflow obstruction, inflammation, altered immune cell responses (termed immunosenescence) and a loss of proteostasis. Many of these processes are present in AATD but at an earlier age and more advanced stage compared with chronological aging alone. Augmentation therapy does not completely abrogate the manifold disease processes present in AATD. New approaches are needed. There is emerging evidence that both age- and AATD-related disease processes are amenable to correction by targeting proteostasis, autophagy, immunosenescence and epigenetic factors. This review explores the impact of the aging process on AATD presentation and discusses novel therapeutic strategies to mitigate low levels of AAT or misfolded AAT in an aging host."

We examined our experience with lung transplantation for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with and without A1ATD to compare survival and rates of postoperative surgical complications. Patients with A1ATD and non-A1ATD COPD undergoing lung transplantation from 1988-2015 at our institution were analyzed. Complications were categorized into non-gastroenteritis gastrointestinal (GI), wound, airway, and reoperation for bleeding. Overall and complication-free survival were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards models. Three hundred and eighty-five patients underwent lung transplant for COPD (98 A1ATD). For A1ATD, 56.1% underwent single lung transplantation (80.6% for COPD). Early overall and complication-free survival was worse for A1ATD, but this trend reversed at longer follow up. Unadjusted estimated survival showed advantage for COPD at 90 days and 1 year, which attenuated by 5 years and reversed at 10 years (P<0.001). On adjusted analysis, A1ATD was associated with a trend toward lower complication-free survival at 90 days and 1 year, due partly to increased rates of post-transplant GI pathology, particularly in the era of the lung allocation score (LAS). A1ATD lung recipients had worse short-term complication-free survival but improved long-term survival compared to COPD patients. A1ATD was associated with greater risk of new GI pathology after transplant. Close monitoring of A1ATD patients with timely evaluation of GI complaints after transplant is warranted."

After the exclusion of biliary atresia, a clinically driven genetic testing was performed, entailing 3 different approaches with different wideness: confirmatory single-gene testing; focused virtual panels; and wide search through trio whole-exome sequencing. We enrolled 125 children (66 female, median age 2 months); 96 (77%) patients had hypocholic stools and were evaluated rapidly to exclude biliary atresia, which was the final diagnosis in 74 (59%). Overall, 50 patients underwent genetic testing, 6 with single confirmatory gene testing, 38 through panels, and 6 with trio whole-exome sequencing because of complex phenotype. The genetic testing detection rate was 60%: the final diagnosis was Alagille syndrome in 11, progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 2 in 6, alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency in 3, and progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 3 in 2; a further 7 genetic conditions were identified in 1 child each.

It is a rare malignancy of unclear histogenesis; it is a diagnosis of exclusion that requires extensive use of immunohistochemistry to rule out other malignancies. Pleomorphic dermal sarcoma typically presents as a solitary tumor in sun-exposed areas and may have unpredictable clinical behavior, with some tumors associated with metastasis and death. We present an unusual case of multifocal pleomorphic dermal sarcoma arising in the areas of alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency panniculitis in a lung transplant patient. Our patient was a 58-year-old white woman whose initial presentation was consistent with alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency panniculitis. She then developed extensive multifocal, bleeding, and ulcerated nodules in the areas of the panniculitis. A skin biopsy was consistent with a diagnosis of pleomorphic dermal sarcoma. Her immunosuppressive regimen was decreased, and she was treated with liposomal doxorubicin 40 mg/m<sup>2</sup> every 3 weeks with some initial improvement in the size of her tumors. However, soon after beginning therapy, she developed pneumonia and septic shock and ultimately died from multi-organ failure. We hypothesize that chronic, multifocal inflammation in the skin in the setting of immunosuppression led to simultaneous, malignant transformation in numerous skin lesions. We discuss the challenges of diagnosing pleomorphic dermal sarcoma, therapeutic options, and stress the need for multidisciplinary management of these cases."

To examine the aetiology and co-morbidity of BE in the capital area in Finland. Two hundred five patients with BE diagnosis and follow up visits between 2016 and 2017 in Helsinki University Hospital were invited to participate in the study.

To the study included 95 adult patients and seventy nine percent of the BE patients were women. The mean age was 69 years (SD ± 13). Asthma was a comorbid condition in 68% of the patients but in 26% it was estimated to be the cause of BE. Asthma was aetiological factor for BE if it had been diagnosed earlier than BE. As 41% BE were idiopathic, in 11% the disorder was postinfectious and others were associated to rheumatic disease, Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, IgG deficiency and Kartagener syndrome. The most common co-morbidities in addition to asthma were cardiovascular disease (30%), gastroesophageal reflux disease (26%), overweight (22%), diabetes (16%), inactive neoplasia (15%), and immunodeficiency (12%). Extensive BE was found in 68% of BE patients in whom four or more lobes were affected. Risk factors for extensive BE were asthma (OR 2.7), asthma as aetiology for BE (OR 4.3), and rhinosinusitis (OR 3.1). Asthma was associated to BE in 68% and it was estimated as aetiology in every fourth patient. However, retrospectively, it is difficult to exclude asthma as a background cause in patients with asthma-like symptoms and respiratory infections. We propose asthma as an aetiology factor for BE if it is diagnosed earlier than BE. Asthma and rhinosinusitis were predictive for extensive BE."

Severe AATD is caused by a homozygous mutation in the SERPINA1 gene that encodes the Glu342Lys substitution (called the Pi*Z mutation, Pi*ZZ genotype). Pi*ZZ carriers may develop lung and liver diseases. Mutation-associated lung disorders have been well studied, but less is known about the effects in liver. We assessed the liver disease burden and associated features in adults with this form of AATD. We collected data from 554 Pi*ZZ adults (403 in an exploratory cohort, 151 in a confirmatory cohort), in 9 European countries, with AATD who were homozygous for the Pi*Z mutation, and 234 adults without the Pi*Z mutation (controls), all without pre-existing liver disease. We collected data on demographic parameters, comorbidities, lung- and liver-related health, and blood samples for laboratory analysis. Liver fibrosis was assessed non-invasively via the serum tests Aspartate Aminotransferase to Platelet Ratio Index and HepaScore and via transient elastography. Liver steatosis was determined via transient elastography-based controlled attenuation parameter. We performed histologic analyses of livers from transgenic mice that overexpress the AATD-associated Pi*Z variant. Serum levels of liver enzymes were significantly higher in Pi*ZZ carriers vs controls. Based on non-invasive tests for liver fibrosis, significant fibrosis was suspected in 20%-36% of Pi*ZZ carriers, whereas signs of advanced fibrosis were 9- to 20-fold more common in Pi*ZZ carriers compared to non-carriers. Male sex; age older than 50 years; increased levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, or γ-glutamyl transferase; and low numbers of platelets were associated with higher liver fibrosis burden. We did not find evidence for a relationship between lung function and liver fibrosis. Controlled attenuation parameter ≥280 dB/m, suggesting severe steatosis, was detected in 39% of Pi*ZZ carriers vs 31% of controls. Carriers of Pi*ZZ had lower serum concentrations of triglyceride and low- and very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol than controls, suggesting impaired hepatic secretion of lipid. Livers from Pi*Z-overexpressing mice had steatosis and down-regulation of genes involved in lipid secretion. In studies of AATD adults with the Pi*ZZ mutation, and of Pi*Z-overexpressing mice, we found evidence of liver steatosis and impaired lipid secretion. We identified factors associated with significant liver fibrosis in patients, which could facilitate hepatologic assessment and counseling of individuals who carry the Pi*ZZ mutation.

We identified compounds that inhibited intracellular accumulation of AAT in hepatocytes in vitro. These data suggest that drug binding to a structural site encoded by a mutation associated with AAT deficiency has the potential for clinical utility by modulating conformational transitions."

Here, we investigate point-mutations in the mouse Serpina1a antitrypsin-orthologue, which are homolog-equivalent to ones known to cause severe A1AT-D in human. We combine in silico and in vitro methods and we find that analyzed mutations do introduce potential disease-causing properties into Serpina1a.

    "abstract": "Lung transplantation is an established therapeutic option for patients with irreversible end-stage pulmonary disease limiting life expectancy and quality of life. Common indications for lung transplantation include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, cystic fibrosis, pulmonary arterial hypertension, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. Complications of lung transplantation can be broadly divided etiologically into surgical, infectious, immunologic, or neoplastic. Moreover, specific complications often occur within a certain time interval following surgery, which can be broadly classified as early (<6 wk), intermediate (6 wk to 6 mo), and late (>6 mo). Thus, each group of complications can further be categorized on the basis of the time continuum from transplantation. Imaging, primarily by high-resolution computed tomography, plays a critical role in early diagnosis of complications after lung transplantation. Early recognition of complications by the radiologist, and initiation of therapy, contributes to improved morbidity and mortality. However, accurate diagnosis is only feasible if one has a thorough understanding of the major etiologic categories of complications and how they relate to the time course since transplantation. We review imaging manifestations of lung transplant complications via a framework that includes the following major etiologic categories: surgical; infectious; immunologic; and neoplastic; and the following time frames: surgery to 6 weeks; 6 weeks to 6 months; and beyond 6 months. We propose this approach as a logical, evidence-based algorithm to construct a narrow, optimal differential diagnosis of lung transplantation complications."

    "abstract": "In human α1-antitrypsin deficiency, homozygous carriers of the Z (E324K) mutation in the gene SERPINA1 have insufficient circulating α1-antitrypsin and are predisposed to emphysema. Misfolding and accumulation of the mutant protein in hepatocytes also causes endoplasmic reticulum stress and underpins long-term liver damage. Here, we describe transgenic zebrafish (Danio rerio) expressing the wildtype or the Z mutant form of human α1-antitrypsin in hepatocytes. As observed in afflicted humans, and in rodent models, about 80% less α1-antitrypsin is evident in the circulation of zebrafish expressing the Z mutant. Although these zebrafish also show signs of liver stress, they do not accumulate α1-antitrypsin in hepatocytes. This new zebrafish model will provide useful insights into understanding and treatment of α1-antitrypsin deficiency."

    "title": "Understanding the role of neutrophils in chronic inflammatory airway disease.",
    "abstract": "Airway neutrophilia is a common feature of many chronic inflammatory lung diseases and is associated with disease progression, often regardless of the initiating cause. Neutrophils and their products are thought to be key mediators of the inflammatory changes in the airways of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and have been shown to cause many of the pathological features associated with disease, including emphysema and mucus hypersecretion. Patients with COPD also have high rates of bacterial colonisation and recurrent infective exacerbations, suggesting that neutrophil host defence mechanisms are impaired, a concept supported by studies showing alterations to neutrophil migration, degranulation and reactive oxygen species production in cells isolated from patients with COPD. Although the role of neutrophils is best described in COPD, many of the pathological features of this disease are not unique to COPD and also feature in other chronic inflammatory airway diseases, including asthma, cystic fibrosis, alpha-1 anti-trypsin deficiency, and bronchiectasis. There is increasing evidence for immune cell dysfunction contributing to inflammation in many of these diseases, focusing interest on the neutrophil as a key driver of pulmonary inflammation and a potential therapeutic target than spans diseases. This review discusses the evidence for neutrophilic involvement in COPD and also considers their roles in alpha-1 anti-trypsin deficiency, bronchiectasis, asthma, and cystic fibrosis. We provide an in-depth assessment of the role of the neutrophil in each of these conditions, exploring recent advances in understanding, and finally discussing the possibility of common mechanisms across diseases."

    "abstract": "α-1 Antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency is the leading genetic cause of emphysema; however, until recently, no genuine animal models of AAT deficiency existed, hampering the development of new therapies. This shortcoming is now addressed by both <i>AAT</i>-null and antisense oligonucleotide mouse models. The goal of this study was to more fully characterize the antisense oligonucleotide model. Both liver <i>AAT</i> mRNA and serum AAT levels were lower in anti-AAT versus control oligonucleotide-treated mice after 6, 12, and 24 wk. Six and twelve weeks of anti-AAT oligonucleotide therapy induced emphysema that was worse in female than male mice: mean linear intercept 73.4 versus 62.5 μm (<i>P</i> = 0.000003). However, at 24 wk of treatment, control oligonucleotide-treated mice also developed emphysema. After 6 wk of therapy, anti-AAT male and female mice demonstrated a similar reduction serum AAT levels, and there were no sex or treatment-specific alterations in inflammatory, serine protease, or matrix metalloproteinase mRNAs, with the exception of <i>chymotrypsin-like elastase 1</i> (<i>Cela1</i>), which was 7- and 9-fold higher in anti-AAT versus control male and female lungs, respectively, and 1.6-fold higher in female versus male anti-AAT-treated lungs (<i>P</i> = 0.04). While lung AAT protein levels were reduced in anti-AAT-treated mice, lung <i>AAT</i> mRNA levels were unaffected. These findings are consistent with increased emphysema susceptibility of female patients with AAT-deficiency. The anti-AAT oligonucleotide model of AAT deficiency is useful for compartment-specific, in vivo molecular biology, and sex-specific studies of AAT-deficient emphysema, but it should be used with caution in studies longer than 12-wk duration."

    "abstract": "Sulfur mustard (SM) is a mutagenic compound that targets various organs. Although it causes a wide range of abnormalities, cellular and molecular mechanisms of its action are not-well-understood. Oxidation of DNA, proteins, lipids, as well as depletion of cellular nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), antioxidants and increase of intracellular calcium are the hypothesized mechanisms of its action at the acute phase of injury. In this review, the proteome analysis of SM toxicity has been considered. We selected articles that considered proteomics analysis of SM toxicity with two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DE) followed by mass spectrometry. Our search yielded nine related articles, four original in vitro and five human studies. The results of these studies have revealed a change in expression pattern of various proteins such as haptoglobin, amyloid A1, surfactant proteins, S100 proteins, apolipoprotein, Vit D binding protein, transferrin, alpha 1 antitrypsin, protein disulfide isomerase and antioxidant enzymes in patients who were exposed to SM about 30 years ago. Most of these proteins are up- or down-regulated in response to excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress (OS). There is a tight link between the expression pattern of these proteins with accumulation of leukocytes, inflammatory conditions, antioxidant depletion, mitochondrial deficiency, as well as increased expression or activity of several proteases such as caspases and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Therefore, excessive production of ROS and OS along with chronic inflammatory may be the long-term toxic effects of SM following acute exposure."

    "abstract": "Inherited mutations in SERPINA1 coding for the alpha-1 antitrypsin (A1AT) protein is the only well established cause of hereditary emphysema. We aimed to identify the genetic ecause of early-onset emphysema in a five-generation French-Canadian family free of A1AT deficiency. Between Dec 1, 2014, and April 1, 2017, we investigated 63 individuals from a single pedigree, including 55 with DNA available. Whole-exome sequencing was done in a convenience sample of 14 individuals (nine with unambiguous expression of the typical form of emphysema observed in this family). We filtered rare non-synonymous variants that were predicted to be damaging to identify a single mutation in a biologically relevant gene shared among all affected individuals. We assessed segregation with the disease in additional family members who were not evaluated by whole-exome sequencing. The effect of the candidate variant on protein function was evaluated in vitro. mRNA and protein expression of the candidate gene was assessed in lung samples from unrelated individuals (n=80) with and without emphysema who underwent surgery for lung cancer at our institution. A rare in-silico-predicted damaging variant (Ala455Thr) was identified in the protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 6 (PTPN6) gene, also known as SHP-1, an important negative regulator of immune processes. 20 (95%) of 21 family members with computed tomography-confirmed emphysema were heterozygotes for the Ala455Thr mutation. No Thr455 homozygotes were identified. Emphysema or reduced diffusion capacity was observed in all heterozygotes with a history of smoking. Incomplete penetrance of the mutation and variable degrees of emphysema were observed in never smokers. The Ala455Thr mutation in SHP-1 caused a reduction in phosphatase activity in vitro, confirming the loss-of-function effect of the mutation. mRNA and protein expression of PTPN6 were upregulated in smokers, but were not associated with emphysema or severity of airflow limitation. An inherited variant in the gene PTPN6 is responsible for early-onset emphysema in this family. To our knowledge, this is the second form of hereditary emphysema since the discovery of A1AT deficiency in the 1960s, representing a breakthrough in understanding the genetics and pathogenesis of emphysema.

The Bronchiectasis Research Registry provides a central database for studying patients with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis. This report consists of information from 13 U.S. sites pertaining to the 3 study diagnoses. Patients with AATD (SZ and ZZ phenotypes only), CVI (patients with IgG≤500), PCD (history of physician diagnosed Kartagener's syndrome or PCD), and patients with confirmed absence of the above 3 diagnoses (idiopathic control group) were included in the study. Descriptive statistics were computed for the main demographic and clinical characteristics of the sample stratified by group. Values between the groups were compared using Kruskal-Wallis test, and Chi-squared/ Fisher's exact tests respectively. The significance level was set at 0.05. Software SAS 9.4 was used to perform the statistical analyses. Of the 2170 participants in the database enrolled as of January 2017, 615 respondents had sufficient data and were included in the analyses. Patients with PCD (n=79, mean age 41.9 years [standard deviation (SD)=14.5]) were significantly younger than patients with AATD (n=58, mean age 66.9 [SD=10.7]), CVI (n=18, mean age 66.7 years [SD=10.5]) or the idiopathic group (n=460, mean age 64.2 [SD=15.9]), <i>p</i><.0001. Compared to other groups, those with PCD had lower pulmonary function (forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV<sub>1</sub>] forced vital capacity [FVC] and FEV1/FVC ratio) (<i>p</i><0.01), and a greater proportion of them reported having exacerbations and/or hospitalizations in the past 2 years (<i>p</i><0.01). Overall, <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> and <i>Staphylococcus</i> <i>aureus</i> were the organisms most commonly isolated from sputum. Mycobacterial infection was most commonly reported in those with AATD. This report from the U.S. Bronchiectasis Research Registry compares and contrasts differences in the clinical features of patients suffering from 3 rare conditions, with different underlying causes, to those without. The group with PCD had more symptoms, greater morbidity, lower lung function and more commonly were infected by <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>.

    "title": "The Biological Effects of Double-Dose Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Augmentation Therapy. A Pilot Clinical Trial.",
    "abstract": "<b>Rationale:</b> Augmentation therapy with intravenous AAT (alpha-1 antitrypsin) is the only specific therapy for individuals with pulmonary disease from AAT deficiency (AATD). The recommended standard dose (SD; 60 mg/kg/wk) elevates AAT trough serum levels to around 50% of normal; however, outside of slowing emphysema progression, its effects in other clinical outcomes have not been rigorously proven.<b>Objectives:</b> To evaluate the biological effects of normalizing AAT trough levels with double-dose (DD) therapy (120 mg/kg/wk) in subjects with AATD already receiving SD therapy.<b>Methods:</b> Clinically stable subjects were evaluated after 4 weeks of SD therapy, followed by 4 weeks of DD therapy, and 4 weeks after return to SD therapy. At the end of each phase, BAL fluid (BALF) and plasma samples were obtained.<b>Measurements and Main Results:</b> DD therapy increased trough AAT levels to normal and, compared with SD therapy, reduced serine protease activity in BALF (elastase and cathepsin G), plasma elastase footprint (Aα-Val<sup>360</sup>), and markers of elastin degradation (desmosine/isodesmosine) in BALF. DD therapy also further downregulated BALF ILs and cytokines including Jak-STAT (Janus kinases-signal transducer and activator of transcription proteins), TNFα (tumor necrosis factor-α), and T-cell receptor signaling pathways, cytokines involved in macrophage migration, eosinophil recruitment, humoral and adaptive immunity, neutrophil activation, and cachexia. On restarting SD after DD treatment, a possible carryover effect was seen for several biological markers.<b>Conclusions:</b> Subjects with AATD on SD augmentation therapy still exhibit inflammation, protease activity, and elastin degradation that can be further improved by normalizing AAT levels. Higher AAT dosing than currently recommended may lead to enhanced clinical benefits and should be explored further.Clinical trial registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01669421)."

    "title": "Identifying Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency Based on Computed Tomography Evidence of Emphysema.",
    "abstract": "Introduction Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is most commonly caused by smoking tobacco or cigarettes. However, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is the only genetic disorder known to cause COPD and these patients often present with emphysema earlier in life and with more severe disease. Additionally, AATD patients are often misdiagnosed with other lung disorders, and the diagnosis is often delayed for up to a decade. Furthermore, several clinicians may see the patient before genetic testing is performed and an official diagnosis is made. We hypothesized that patients with radiographic emphysema on computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest would represent an enriched population of patients with a higher prevalence of alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) carrier or heterozygous state. Methods We evaluated 250 in-patients with chest computed tomography (CT) findings of emphysema, and per clinical guidelines, all were tested for AAT with Alphakit finger stick blood collection kits. Sampling 250 patients provided power to detect a carrier prevalence of 20% +/- 1.0%. Results A total of 250 patients were recruited of which 53% were male, 91% Caucasian, 7% African American, and 16% active smokers. They smoked an average of 39 packs per year. The prevalence of carrier status (Pi*MS or Pi*MZ) was 6.8% (95% CI (4%, 11%)). The mean forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV-1) was 53%, predicted among Pi*MM patients (n=126) and not significantly different from the Pi*MS group (50%, n=13). 69% of Pi*MM were diagnosed with asthma or COPD, vs. 79% of Pi*MS (n=14) and 100% Pi*MZ (n=3), but the difference was not significant (p=0.4). Conclusion In the population studied, compared to a cohort of patients with abnormal pulmonary function tests (PFTs), radiographically evident emphysema did not identify patients at higher risk of being heterozygous or homozygous for AAT deficiency."

    "abstract": "Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) is an acute-phase protein with strong inhibitory activity towards proteolytic enzymes, mainly elastase but also trypsin, chymotrypsin and thrombin. The biological role of the protein and the effects of its deficiency have been subjects of scientific research for years, yet in many areas our knowledge remains incomplete. Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD), a defect in AAT synthesis and functionality, is one of the most frequently inherited genetic disorders among Caucasian populations. Its severe form is characterized by very low serum levels of AAT, and it most often affects the lungs (causing early-onset emphysema or chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD)) and/or liver (leading to jaundice and liver cirrhosis in children and adults). However, little is known about other possible clinical consequences of AAT deficiency. We discuss AAT's potential role in mechanisms regulating human fertility and gestation, with a particular emphasis on the clinical context and on indications for AATD diagnostic testing."

Areas covered: Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, a genetic form of emphysema, provides an example of this precision approach to diagnosis and therapy. To date, research in COPD pharmacogenomics has been limited by small sample sizes, lack of accessible target tissue, failure to consider COPD subtypes, and different outcomes relevant for various medications. There have been several published genome-wide association studies and other omics studies in COPD pharmacogenomics; however, clinical implementation remains far away. There is a growing evidence base for precision prescription of inhaled corticosteroids in COPD, based on clinical phenotypes and blood biomarkers, but not yet based on pharmacogenomics. Expert opinion: At this time, there is insufficient evidence for clinical implementation of COPD pharmacogenomics. Additional genome-wide studies will be required to discover predictors of drug response and to identify genomic biomarkers of COPD subtypes, which could be targeted with subtype-directed therapies."

Although a delayed diagnosis is logically presumed to be associated with adverse effects, confirmatory evidence that a delay in diagnosis confers harm is sparse. The current study characterized the association between a delayed diagnosis and the clinical status at the time of diagnosis. Patients with newly diagnosed severe deficiency of alpha-1 antitrypsin received questionnaires that assessed self-reported diagnostic delay, the St George Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) and COPD Assessment Test. Results of spirometry were retrieved and the relationship between the diagnostic delay interval and FEV<sub>1</sub>% predicted, SGRQ, and COPD Assessment Test were assessed. Forty subjects were recruited (31 with PI*ZZ, 9 with PI*SZ). Values for FEV<sub>1</sub>% predicted, SGRQ, and COPD Assessment Test were available for 17, 40, and 32 subjects, respectively. The relationship between the diagnostic delay interval and all outcomes was directionally consistent with an adverse impact of increasing diagnostic delay. For each additional year of diagnostic delay, the subject's FEV<sub>1</sub>% predicted decreased by 0.3% (<i>P</i> = .66), The SGRQ Total score increased by 1.6 points (<i>P</i> < .001), and the COPD Assessment Test score increased by 0.7 points (<i>P</i> = .004). The results of this analysis were consistent with a delayed diagnosis of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency being associated with worse COPD-related symptoms and functional status, and with a trend toward worsened air-flow obstruction. Given that alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is associated with accelerated emphysema progression, these findings underscore the importance of early detection of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency and reinforce guidelines that endorse alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency testing in all adults with fixed air-flow obstruction and first-degree relatives of individuals with severe deficiency of alpha-1 antitrypsin."

As we await the first trials utilizing ex vivo CRISPR editing, implementation of CRISPR-based gene editing as an in vivo treatment directly in patients still remains an ultimate challenge. However, quickly accumulating evidence has provided proof-of-concept for efficacious editing in vivo. Attempts to edit genes directly in animals have largely relied on classical vector systems based on virus-based delivery of gene cassettes encoding the Cas9 endonuclease and single guide RNA, the key components of the CRISPR system. However, whereas persistent gene expression has been the primary goal of gene therapy for decades, things may be different in the case of CRISPR delivery. Is short-term presence of the CRISPR components perhaps sufficient for efficacy and ideal for safety?-and are strategies needed for restricting immune recognition of the bacteria-derived editing tool? Here, while answers to these questions still blow in the wind, we review prominent examples of genome editing with focus on targeting of genes with CRISPR in liver, muscles, and eyes of the mouse."

For many years, knowledge of the genetic basis of COPD was limited to Mendelian syndromes, such as alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency and cutis laxa, caused by rare genetic variants. Over the past decade, the proliferation of genome-wide association studies, the accessibility of whole-genome sequencing, and the development of novel methods for analyzing genetic variation data have led to a substantial increase in the understanding of genetic variants that play a role in COPD susceptibility and COPD-related phenotypes. COPDGene (Genetic Epidemiology of COPD), a multicenter, longitudinal study of over 10,000 current and former cigarette smokers, has been pivotal to these breakthroughs in understanding the genetic basis of COPD. To date, over 20 genetic loci have been convincingly associated with COPD affection status, with additional loci demonstrating association with COPD-related phenotypes such as emphysema, chronic bronchitis, and hypoxemia.

The disease also has a dramatic role in increasing rate of mortality and morbidity in recent years. Air pollution, long-term exposure to particulate matter and irritating gases, especially cigarette smoke, genetic inheritance which has an impact on the initial forced expiratory volume one in second (FEV1), and alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency are among common COPD risk factors. The objective of this study is to evaluate parameters and serum AAT levels in COPD patients. Having taken the approval of local ethical committee, this cross-sectional study was performed with adult patients diagnosed with COPD, whose serum AAT levels were measured through nephelometric analysis in Kars Harakani State Hospital where secondary health care is served. The study evaluated ATT levels in patients' serum in relation to their age, gender, body mass (BMI), exposure to cigarette smoke, FEV1 percentage, hospitalization in pulmonology or intensive care unit through a year, mortality status, white blood cell (WBC), c-reactive protein (CRP) and blood gases. The average age of the 243 patients included in the study was 68.41±11.52 and 160 (65.8%) of them were male. The age and BMI of the female patients were higher. Of the all patients only a single patient's serum AAT level was below the reference value. AAT levels were similar in both genders irrespective of their being exposed to cigarette smoke or being discharged or being exitus at their first admission to hospital, being exitus in the first year of disease diagnose, and being hospitalized in intensive care unit. AAT levels were reasonably correlated with WBC and CRP in a positive way (p<0.001 r=0.289 for WBC; p<0.001, r=0.295 for CRP). AAT levels were seen to significantly increase along with COPD stages which go up with FEV1 percentages (p<0.001). CRP was watched to have increased to Stage III COPD (severe COPD). However, it was watched to have decreased in Stage IV (very severe COPD) (p =0.179). In the study, AAT serum levels of COPD patients were examined.

To assess the variability of AATD diagnosis/treatment in Europe, and to evaluate clinicians' views on methods to optimise management, specialist AATD clinicians were invited to complete a web-based survey. Surveys were completed by 15 physicians from 14 centres in 13 European countries. All respondents perceived the AATD diagnosis rate to be low in their country; 77% of physicians believed that ∼15% of cases were diagnosed. Low awareness was perceived as the greatest barrier to diagnosis. Spirometry was considered more practical than quantitative computed tomography (QCT) for monitoring AATD patients in clinical practice; QCT was considered more useful in trials. AAT therapy provision was reported to be highly variable: France and Germany were reported to treat the highest proportion (∼60%) of diagnosed patients, in contrast to the UK and Hungary, where virtually no patients receive AAT therapy. Most clinicians supported self-administration and extended dosing intervals to improve convenience of AAT therapy. This survey indicates that AATD diagnosis and management are highly heterogeneous in Europe; European cooperation is essential to generate data to support access to AAT therapy. Improving convenience of AAT therapy is an ongoing objective."

    "title": "Reactive centre loop dynamics and serpin specificity.",
    "abstract": "Serine proteinase inhibitors (serpins), typically fold to a metastable native state and undergo a major conformational change in order to inhibit target proteases. However, conformational lability of the native serpin fold renders them susceptible to misfolding and aggregation, and underlies misfolding diseases such as α<sub>1</sub>-antitrypsin deficiency. Serpin specificity towards its protease target is dictated by its flexible and solvent exposed reactive centre loop (RCL), which forms the initial interaction with the target protease during inhibition. Previous studies have attempted to alter the specificity by mutating the RCL to that of a target serpin, but the rules governing specificity are not understood well enough yet to enable specificity to be engineered at will. In this paper, we use conserpin, a synthetic, thermostable serpin, as a model protein with which to investigate the determinants of serpin specificity by engineering its RCL. Replacing the RCL sequence with that from α1-antitrypsin fails to restore specificity against trypsin or human neutrophil elastase. Structural determination of the RCL-engineered conserpin and molecular dynamics simulations indicate that, although the RCL sequence may partially dictate specificity, local electrostatics and RCL dynamics may dictate the rate of insertion during protease inhibition, and thus whether it behaves as an inhibitor or a substrate. Engineering serpin specificity is therefore substantially more complex than solely manipulating the RCL sequence, and will require a more thorough understanding of how conformational dynamics achieves the delicate balance between stability, folding and function required by the exquisite serpin mechanism of action."

    "abstract": "This study used the stress buffering perspective to identify social resources, including social network support, having a high quality marriage, and spousal support, that protect against deleterious effects of the progression of Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) on quality of life. Participants included 130 married adults living with AATD. We measured participants' quality of life in three ways: perceived stress, life satisfaction, and perceptions of social stigma. The results suggested that disease progression corresponded positively with perceived stress and negatively with life satisfaction. Social network support moderated the association between disease progression and perceived stress and social stigma, and spousal support moderated the association between disease progression and perceived stress and life satisfaction. Marital quality was not a significant moderator. The discussion highlights the stress buffering effects of social support from close others."

    "title": "Modulation of calreticulin expression reveals a novel exosome-mediated mechanism of Z variant α<sub>1</sub>-antitrypsin disposal.",
    "abstract": "α<sub>1</sub>-Antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is an inherited disease characterized by emphysema and liver disease. AATD is most often caused by a single amino acid substitution at position 342 in the mature protein, resulting in the Z mutation of the AAT gene (ZAAT). This substitution is associated with misfolding and accumulation of ZAAT in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of hepatocytes, causing a toxic gain of function. ERdj3 is an ER luminal DnaJ homologue, which, along with calreticulin, directly interacts with misfolded ZAAT. We hypothesize that depletion of each of these chaperones will change the fate of ZAAT polymers. Our study demonstrates that calreticulin modulation reveals a novel ZAAT degradation mechanism mediated by exosomes. Using human PiZZ hepatocytes and K42, a mouse calreticulin-deficient fibroblast cell line, our results show ERdj3 and calreticulin directly interact with ZAAT in PiZZ hepatocytes. Silencing calreticulin induces calcium independent ZAAT-ERdj3 secretion through the exosome pathway. This co-secretion decreases ZAAT aggregates within the ER of hepatocytes. We demonstrate that calreticulin has an inhibitory effect on exosome-mediated ZAAT-ERdj3 secretion. This is a novel ZAAT degradation process that involves a DnaJ homologue chaperone bound to ZAAT. In this context, calreticulin modulation may eliminate the toxic gain of function associated with aggregation of ZAAT in lung and liver, thus providing a potential new therapeutic approach to the treatment of AATD-related liver disease."

    "abstract": "Phase 1 and phase 2 gene therapy trials using intramuscular (IM) administration of a recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype 1 (rAAV1) for replacement of serum alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency have shown long-term (5-year) stable transgene expression at approximately 2% to 3% of therapeutic levels, arguing for the long-term viability of this approach to gene replacement of secreted serum protein deficiencies. However, achieving these levels required 100 IM injections to deliver 135 mL of vector, and further dose escalation is limited by the scalability of direct IM injection. To further advance the dose escalation, we sought to bridge the rAAV-AAT clinical development program to regional limb perfusion, comparing two methods previously established for gene therapy, peripheral venous limb perfusion (VLP) and an intra-arterial push and dwell (IAPD) using rAAV1 and rAAV8 in a non-human primate (rhesus macaque) study. The rhesus AAT transgene was used with a c-myc tag to enable quantification of transgene expression. 5 cohorts of animals were treated with rAAV1-IM, rAAV1-VLP, rAAV1-IAPD, rAAV8-VLP, and rAAV8-IAPD (n = 2-3), with a dose of 6 × 10<sup>12</sup> vg/kg. All methods were well tolerated clinically. Potency, as determined by serum levels of AAT, of rAAV1 by the VLP method was twice that observed with direct IM injection; 90 μg/mL with VLP versus 38 μg/mL with direct IM injection. There was an approximately 25-fold advantage in estimated vector genomes retained within the muscle tissue with VLP and a 5-fold improvement in the ratio of total vector genomes retained within muscle as compared with liver. The other methods were intermediate in the potency and retention of vector genomes. Examination of muscle enzyme (CK) levels indicated rAAV1-VLP to be equally safe as compared with IM injection, while the IAPD method showed significant CK elevation. Overall, rAAV1-VLP demonstrates higher potency per vector genome injected and a greater total vector retention within the muscle, as compared to IM injection, while enabling a much greater total dose to be delivered, with equivalent safety. These data provide the basis for continuation of the dose escalation of the rAAV1-AAT program in patients and bode well for rAAV-VLP as a platform for replacement of secreted proteins."

    "abstract": "Orthotopic liver transplantation, rather than drug therapy, is the major curative approach for various inherited metabolic disorders of the liver. However, the scarcity of donated livers is a serious problem. To resolve this, there is an urgent need for novel drugs to treat inherited metabolic disorders of the liver. This requirement, in turn, necessitates the establishment of suitable disease models for many inherited metabolic disorders of the liver that currently lack such models for drug development. Recent studies have shown that human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells generated from patients with inherited metabolic disorders of the liver are an ideal cell source for models that faithfully recapitulate the pathophysiology of inherited metabolic disorders of the liver. By using patient iPS cell-derived hepatocyte-like cells, drug efficacy evaluation and drug screening can be performed. In addition, genome editing technology has enabled us to generate functionally recovered patient iPS cell-derived hepatocyte-like cells in vitro. It is also possible to identify the genetic mutations responsible for undiagnosed liver diseases using iPS cell and genome editing technologies. Finally, a combination of exhaustive analysis, iPS cells, and genome editing technologies would be a powerful approach to accelerate the identification of novel genetic mutations responsible for undiagnosed liver diseases. In this review, we will discuss the usefulness of iPS cell and genome editing technologies in the field of inherited metabolic disorders of the liver, such as alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency and familial hypercholesterolemia."

Given their functional differences and their role in pathogenesis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), monocyte profiling is of clinical interest. Here we investigated blood monocyte subsets in clinically stable COPD patients with alpha1-antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency (PiZZ, n = 7) and with normal AAT variant (PiMM, n = 7). Peripheral whole blood was collected in sodium heparin tubes and incubated with LPS (from E. coli; 1 μg/ml) or placebo for 6 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. To profile monocyte subsets we performed flow cytometry analysis based on HLA-DR and CD14/CD16 staining. HLA-DR + subsets of cells did not differ between PiZZ and PiMM COPD, and healthy controls (n = 7), used as a reference. Monocyte profiling, which express the CD14 and CD16, but not the HLA-DR (HLA-DR-) showed that intermediate monocytes subset was lowest in PiZZ group, and almost totally disappeared from blood treated with LPS. The non-classical subset was almost absent in PiZZ patients independently of LPS treatment. Recent studies demonstrate that non-classical monocytes exhibit a unique ability to protect the vascular endothelium under both homeostatic and inflammatory conditions whereas intermediate monocytes are recruited at a later stage of inflammation, and are associated with secretion of cytokines/chemokines and wound healing. Evident alterations in blood monocyte subsets together with a partial reduction of AAT levels, an important anti-inflammatory protein, can be key factors for the early manifestation of emphysema in some PiZZ AATD carriers."

However, the clinical effect of AAT deficiency remains poorly established in this setting. This study aimed to describe the clinical phenotypes and outcomes of AAV according to AAT phenotypes. This study was conducted retrospectively at Caen University Hospital and included all consecutive granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) patients with positive proteinase 3-ANCA or myeloperoxidase-ANCA, from January 2000 or September 2011, respectively, to June 2016. AAT dosage (nephelometry) and phenotyping (isoelectric focusing in agarose gel) were performed. Among the 142 patients with AAV, including 88 GPA and 54 MPA, 102 (72%) had the MM phenotype, 5 (4%) had a nonpolymerogenic M-variant phenotype, 18 (13%) had the deficient allele MZ, 12 (8%) had MS, 2 (1%) had ZZ, 2 (1%) had SZ, and 1 (1%) had SS. M, Z, and S allele frequencies were 84%, 8%, and 6%, respectively. No association was observed between AAT deficiency and ANCA subtype or AAV phenotype, except for intraalveolar hemorrhage (IAH), which was more frequent in patients harboring at least 1 of the deficient Z or S alleles than in those without any deficient alleles (p < 0.01). Global, renal, or relapse-free survival rates were similar for all subgroups. This study shows that AAT deficiency confers, independently of ANCA subtype, a higher risk of IAH. Prospective studies are required to refine these data and to assess the need for replacement therapy in AAT-deficient patients with AAV."

Oxidative-modified A1AT (oxidized alpha-1-antitrypsin, OxyA1AT) significantly loses ability to protect the lungs from neutrophil elastase. We aimed to investigate OxyA1AT as a potential biomarker associated with onset and severity of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in adult population. The study included 65 patients with COPD (33 smokers and 32 no-smokers) and 46 healthy participants (17 smokers and 29 no-smokers). Determination of OxyA1AT in serum was based on the difference between the inhibitory activities of normal and oxidized A1AT against trypsin and elastase. The level of OxyA1AT was significantly increased in the group of COPD smokers compared to healthy no-smokers (p = 0.030) and COPD no-smokers (p = 0.009). The highest level of OxyA1AT was found in group of smokers with severe and very severe COPD in comparison to the following: no-smokers with the same stage of disease (p = 0.038), smokers with moderate COPD (p = 0.022), and the healthy control group, regardless of the smoking status (control no-smokers p = 0.001 and control smokers p = 0.034). In conclusion, serum level of OxyA1AT would be potentially good biomarker for the assessment of harmful effect of smoking to the onset and severity of COPD. Also, clinical significance of OxyA1AT as prognostic biomarker could be useful in assessing the effectiveness of antioxidant therapy for COPD and emphysema. Suitable and inexpensive laboratory method for determination of OxyA1AT is additional benefit for the introduction of OxyA1AT into routine clinical practice for diagnosis and monitoring of COPD."

We applied the method to images from subjects with emphysema associated with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) and used it to study regional patterns of differential tissue mass. We explored different covariates in 76 controls. Standardization was applied to facilitate comparability between different CT scanners and a standard Z-score (Standard Mass Score, SMS) was developed, representing lung tissue loss compared to normal lung mass. This normative data was defined for the entire lungs and for delineated apical, central and basal regions. The agreement with D<sub>LCO</sub>%pred was explored in a data set of 180 patients with emphysema who participated in a trial of alpha-1-antitrypsin augmentation treatment (RAPID). Large differences between emphysematous and normal tissue of more than 10 standard deviations were found. There was reasonable agreement between SMS and D<sub>LCO</sub>%pred for the global densitometry (κ = 0.252, p < 0.001), varying from κ = 0.138 to κ = 0.219 and 0.264 (p < 0.001), in the apical, central and basal region, respectively. SMS and D<sub>LCO</sub>%pred correlated consistently across apical, central and basal regions. The SMS distribution over the different lung regions showed a distinct pattern suggesting that emphysema due to severe AATD develops from basal to central and ultimately apical regions. Standardization and normalization of lung densitometry is feasible and the adoption of the developed principles helps to characterize the distribution of emphysema, required for clinical decision making."

The unfolded protein response (UPR), comprising of inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α), PKR-like ER kinase (PERK) and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) signaling pathways, is a protective cellular response activated by ER stress. However, UPR activation can also induce cell death upon persistent ER stress. The liver is susceptible to ER stress given its synthetic and other biological functions. Numerous studies from human liver samples and animal disease models have indicated a crucial role of ER stress and UPR signaling pathways in the pathogenesis of liver diseases, including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, alcoholic liver disease, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, cholestatic liver disease, drug-induced liver injury, ischemia/reperfusion injury, viral hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Extensive investigations have demonstrated the potential underlying mechanisms of the induction of ER stress and the contribution of UPR pathways during the development of the diseases. Moreover ER stress and the UPR proteins and genes have become emerging therapeutic targets to treat liver diseases."

AAT deficiency (AATD) is associated with early-onset emphysema and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Of interest are the AATD nonsense mutations (termed null or Q0), the majority of which arise from premature termination codons in the mRNA coding region. We have recently demonstrated that plasma from an AATD patient homozygous for the Null Bolton allele (<i>Q0<sub>bolton</sub></i> ) contains AAT protein of truncated size. Although the potential to alleviate the phenotypic consequences of AATD by increasing levels of truncated protein holds therapeutic promise, protein functionality is key. The goal of this study was to evaluate the structural features and anti-inflammatory capacity of Q0<sub>bolton</sub>-AAT. A low-abundance, truncated AAT protein was confirmed in plasma of a Q0<sub>bolton</sub>-AATD patient and was secreted by patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cell-hepatic cells. Functional assays confirmed the ability of purified Q0<sub>bolton</sub>-AAT protein to bind neutrophil elastase and to inhibit protease activity. Q0<sub>bolton</sub>-AAT bound IL-8 and leukotriene B<sub>4</sub>, comparable to healthy control M-AAT, and significantly decreased leukotriene B<sub>4</sub>-induced neutrophil adhesion (<i>p</i> = 0.04). Through a mechanism involving increased mRNA stability (<i>p</i> = 0.007), ataluren treatment of HEK-293 significantly increased <i>Q0<sub>bolton</sub>-AAT</i> mRNA expression (<i>p</i> = 0.03) and Q0<sub>bolton</sub>-AAT truncated protein secretion (<i>p</i> = 0.04). Results support the rationale for treatment with pharmacological agents that augment levels of functional Q0<sub>bolton</sub>-AAT protein, thus offering a potential therapeutic option for AATD patients with rare mutations of similar theratype."

We expect to find a higher prevalence of A1AT carriers in patients with diverticulosis compared to patients without diverticulosis. Having diverticulosis does not affect the general health of these individuals per se, when asymptomatic. Once an association is found, present findings can be the basis for a second study to assess the risk of developing acute diverticulitis and its disease course in carriers of A1AT deficiency.

Over the past 10-15 years, genome-wide association studies analysis of common variants has provide little in the way of new genetic profiling markers for asthma and COPD. Whole exome/genome sequencing has provided a new method to identify lowly abundant alleles, which might have a much higher impact. Although, low population numbers due to high costs has hindered early studies, recent studies have reached genome wide significance. The use of genetic profiling of COPD in the clinic is current limited to the identification of Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, while being absent in asthma.

    "abstract": "Distinct pathologies can cause chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Emphysema is a COPD-phenotype characterized by destruction of lung parenchyma. Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a genetic cause of emphysema, whereas smoking is the most important risk factor of non-AATD emphysema. A general underappreciation of non-AATD emphysema has hampered progress in the field, and clinical guidelines have prohibited the use of emphysema as a diagnosis. Non-AATD emphysema, however, is far from irrelevant as it associates with dyspnea, reduced exercise capacity and relevant outcome measures. Areas covered: Mechanisms underlying enhanced tissue loss in emphysema are protease/antiprotease imbalance, increased oxidative stress, several fundamental cell biological processes such as programmed cell death and autophagy, and impaired repair mechanisms. Therapeutic options for emphysema vary from smoking cessation to lung volume reduction. Current pharmacological treatments have less favorable effects in emphysematous than in non-emphysematous COPD patients. Expert opinion: We advocate the acknowledgment of non-AATD emphysema as a clinical diagnosis and propose to end the era of bringing all pathologies that may lead to chronic airflow limitation together under the umbrella-term of COPD. Decelerating proteolysis and restoring damage should be main targets in emphysema. Vitamin A/K, hyaluronan, copper and roflumilast are promising candidates."

    "abstract": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is now well recognized to be a phenotypically heterogeneous disease, and this heterogeneity is underpinned by biological heterogeneity. An \"endotype\" is a group of patients who share the same observed characteristic(s) because of shared underlying biology, and the \"endotype\" concept has emerged as one way of bringing order to this phenotypic heterogeneity by focusing on its biological underpinnings. In principle, biomarkers can help identify endotypes and mark these specific groups of patients as suitable candidates for targeted biological therapies. Among the better-described endotypes of COPD are alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency and eosinophilic COPD. Both of these endotypes have biomarkers and at least some evidence of preferential benefit from targeted therapy. Other biological pathways that may define endotypes of COPD include more general pathways of type 2 inflammation, IL-17-driven inflammation (due to autoimmunity or deposition of nanoparticulate carbon black), bacterial colonization, pathological alterations of the airway mucus gel, and others that are beyond the scope of this review. Whether these biological pathways ultimately are found to segregate patients into very distinct endotypes or subsets (like alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency) or, instead, are present as \"treatable traits\" in various combinations is uncertain. However imperfect, the endotype concept forces a focus on heterogeneity at a biological level, and the development of biomarkers of biological heterogeneity should help advance the goal of developing new therapies for COPD."

Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) is an anti-inflammatory protein with a well-known safety profile. The therapeutic potential of AAT has been tested in several autoimmune disease models. The first study using a recombinant adeno-associated viral (rAAV) vector showed that AAT gene transfer prevented the development of type 1 diabetes (T1D) in the non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse model. Subsequent studies showed that treatment with AAT protein prevented and reversed type 1 diabetes. The beneficial effects of AAT treatment have also been observed in other autoimmune disease models such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. This paper reviews the therapeutic application of AAT and discusses possible mechanisms of action in various autoimmune diseases."

    "title": "Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Substitution for Extrapulmonary Conditions in Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficient Patients.",
    "abstract": "Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a genetic disorder which most commonly manifests as pulmonary emphysema. Accordingly, alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) augmentation therapy aims to reduce the progression of emphysema, as achieved by life-long weekly slow-drip infusions of plasma-derived affinity-purified human AAT. However, not all AATD patients will receive this therapy, due to either lack of medical coverage or low patient compliance. To circumvent these limitations, attempts are being made to develop lung-directed therapies, including inhaled AAT and locally-delivered AAT gene therapy. Lung transplantation is also an ultimate therapy option. Although less common, AATD patients also present with disease manifestations that extend beyond the lung, including vasculitis, diabetes and panniculitis, and appear to experience longer and more frequent hospitalization times and more frequent pneumonia bouts. In the past decade, new mechanism-based clinical indications for AAT therapy have surfaced, depicting a safe, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory and tissue-protective agent. Introduced to non-AATD individuals, AAT appears to provide relief from steroid-refractory graft-versus-host disease, from bacterial infections in cystic fibrosis and from autoimmune diabetes; preclinical studies show benefit also in multiple sclerosis, ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid arthritis, acute myocardial infarction and stroke, as well as ischemia-reperfusion injury and aberrant wound healing processes. While the current augmentation therapy is targeted towards treatment of emphysema, it is suggested that AATD patients may benefit from AAT augmentation therapy geared towards extrapulmonary pathologies as well. Thus, development of mechanism-based, context-specific AAT augmentation therapy protocols is encouraged. In the current review, we will discuss extrapulmonary manifestations of AATD and the potential of AAT augmentation therapy for these conditions."

    "abstract": "PIZZ alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is an autosomal recessive disease affecting approximately 100,000 individuals in the United States and one of the most common hereditary causes of liver disease.<sup>1</sup> The most common form of the disease results from a single base pair mutation (Glu342Lys), known as the \"Z\" mutation, that encodes a mutant protein (Z alpha-1 antritypsin [AAT]) that is prone to misfolding and is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) rather than appropriately secreted. Some of the retained mutant protein attains an unusual aggregated or <i>polymerized</i> conformation. Retained polymeric ZAAT aggregates are hepatotoxic and lead to downstream liver disease in a subset of PiZZ neonates and adults through a gain-of-function mechanism. PiZZ individuals are likewise highly predisposed to developing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)/emphysema as a result of low circulating levels of AAT protein and associated protease-antiprotease imbalance. Much of our understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of AATD is based on studies employing either transgenic mice that express the mutant human Z allele or immortalized cell lines transduced to overexpress ZAAT. While they have been quite informative, these models fail to capture the patient-to-patient variability in disease phenotype that clinicians observe in their AATD patients, raising the question of whether alternative models might provide new insight. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), first described in 2006, have the capacity to differentiate into a broad array of cell types from all 3 germ layers, including hepatocytes. Disease-specific iPSCs have been derived from patients with a variety of monogenic disorders and have been found to faithfully recapitulate features of such diseases as spinal muscular atrophy, familial dysautonomia, Rett syndrome, polycythemia vera, type 1A glycogen storage disease, familial hypercholesterolemia, long QT syndrome, and others. This discussion reviews the potential applications of iPSCs for understanding AATD-associated liver disease as well as for development of potential therapeutic strategies."

    "abstract": "Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) manifests primarily as early-onset emphysema caused by the destruction of the lung by neutrophil elastase due to low amounts of the serine protease inhibitor alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT). The current therapy involves weekly intravenous infusions of AAT-derived from pooled human plasma that is efficacious, yet costly. Gene therapy applications designed to provide constant levels of the AAT protein are currently under development. The challenge is for gene therapy to provide sufficient amounts of AAT to normalize the inhibitor level and anti-neutrophil elastase capacity in the lung. One strategy involves administration of an adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene therapy vector to the pleural space providing both local and systemic production of AAT to reach consistent therapeutic levels. This review focuses on the strategy, advantages, challenges, and updates for intrapleural administration of gene therapy vectors for the treatment of AATD."

I review here augmentation therapy to prevent the progression of lung disease and a range of approaches to treat the liver disease associated with the accumulation of mutant AAT: modifying proteostasis networks that are activated by Z AAT polymers, stimulating autophagy, small interfering RNA and small molecules to block intracellular polymerization, and stem cell technology to correct the genetic defect that underlies AATD."

    "title": "Autophagy in liver diseases: Time for translation?",
    "abstract": "Autophagy is a self-eating catabolic pathway that contributes to liver homeostasis through its role in energy balance and in the quality control of the cytoplasm, by removing misfolded proteins, damaged organelles and lipid droplets. Autophagy not only regulates hepatocyte functions but also impacts on non-parenchymal cells, such as endothelial cells, macrophages and hepatic stellate cells. Deregulation of autophagy has been linked to many liver diseases and its modulation is now recognized as a potential new therapeutic strategy. Indeed, enhancing autophagy may prevent the progression of a number of liver diseases, including storage disorders (alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, Wilson's disease), acute liver injury, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and chronic alcohol-related liver disease. Nevertheless, in some situations such as fibrosis, targeting specific liver cells must be considered, as autophagy displays opposing functions depending on the cell type. In addition, an optimal therapeutic time-window should be identified, since autophagy might be beneficial in the initial stages of disease, but detrimental at more advanced stages, as in the case of hepatocellular carcinoma. Finally, identifying biomarkers of autophagy and methods to monitor autophagic flux in vivo are important steps for the future development of personalized autophagy-targeting strategies. In this review, we provide an update on the regulatory role of autophagy in various aspects of liver pathophysiology, describing the different strategies to manipulate autophagy and discussing the potential to modulate autophagy as a therapeutic strategy in the context of liver diseases."

Here we describe the engineering of chemically optimized antisense oligonucleotides that recruit endogenous human ADARs to edit endogenous transcripts in a simple and programmable way, an approach we call RESTORE (recruiting endogenous ADAR to specific transcripts for oligonucleotide-mediated RNA editing). We observed almost no off-target editing, and natural editing homeostasis was not perturbed. We successfully applied RESTORE to a panel of standard human cell lines and human primary cells and demonstrated repair of the clinically relevant PiZZ mutation, which causes α1-antitrypsin deficiency, and editing of phosphotyrosine 701 in STAT1, the activity switch of the signaling factor. RESTORE requires only the administration of an oligonucleotide, circumvents ectopic expression of proteins, and represents an attractive approach for drug development."

    "abstract": "Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) liver disease is characterized by marked heterogeneity in presentation and progression, despite a common underlying gene mutation, strongly suggesting the involvement of other genetic and/or epigenetic modifiers. Variation in clinical phenotype has added to the challenge of detection, diagnosis, and testing of new therapies in patients with AATD. We examined the contribution of DNA methylation (5-methylcytosine [5mC]) to AATD liver disease heterogeneity because 5mC responds to environmental and genetic cues and its deregulation is a major driver of liver disease. Using liver biopsies from adults with early-stage AATD and the ZZ genotype, genome-wide 5mC patterns were interrogated. We compared DNA methylation among patients with early AATD, and among patients with normal liver, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma derived from multiple etiologic exposures, and linked patient clinical/demographic features. Global analysis revealed significant genomic hypomethylation in AATD liver-impacting genes related to liver cancer, cell cycle, and fibrosis, as well as key regulatory molecules influencing growth, migration, and immune function. Further analysis indicated that 5mC changes are localized, with hypermethylation occurring within a background of genome-wide 5mC loss and with patients with AATD manifesting distinct epigenetic landscapes despite their mutational homogeneity. By integrating clinical data with 5mC landscapes, we observed that CpGs differentially methylated among patients with AATD disease are linked to hallmark clinical features of AATD (e.g., hepatocyte degeneration and polymer accumulation) and further reveal links to well-known sex-specific effects of liver disease progression. Conclusion: Our data reveal molecular epigenetic signatures within this mutationally homogeneous group that point to ways to stratify patients for liver disease risk."

At times, pneumothorax is their herald manifestation. These syndromes have serious potential extrapulmonary complications (e.g., malignant renal tumors in Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome), and surveillance and/or treatment is available for most disorders; thus, establishing a diagnosis is critical.

The markers of the AATD liver disease, how it progresses, and measures for its prevention have not been established. The aim of this study was to analyze the risk of liver disease in individuals with severe AAT deficiency (PiZZ). Longitudinal clinical and laboratory data were obtained from the Swedish National registers, by cross-linkage between the Swedish national AATD register, the Swedish National Patient Register, the National Cancer Register and the National Causes of Death Register. A total of 1595 PiZZ individuals were included in the analyses. The mean follow-up time was 12 years (range 0.3-24). The mean number of follow-ups was 5 (range 2-15). Two or more liver function tests (LFTs) were available in 1123 individuals, and 26% of them (n = 290) had repeated elevated LFTs during the follow-up. The prevalence of any liver disease was 10% (n = 155). Liver cirrhosis was found in 7% of the individuals (n = 116) and hepatocellular carcinoma in 2% (n = 29). The mean age at the onset of liver disease was 61 (SD 15) years. In multivariate analyses, the male gender, age over 50 years, repeated elevated LFTs, hepatitis virus infection, and a diagnosis of diabetes were associated with increased risk of developing liver disease in adulthood (p < 0.01). The prevalence of liver disease in adult PiZZ individuals is 10%. Age over 50 years, the male gender, repeated elevated liver enzymes, hepatitis, and the presence of diabetes mellitus are risk factors for developing liver disease."

    "abstract": "The classical form of α1-antitrypsin deficiency (ATD) is characterized by intracellular accumulation of the misfolded variant α1-antitrypsin Z (ATZ) and severe liver disease in some of the affected individuals. In this study, we investigated the possibility of discovering novel therapeutic agents that would reduce ATZ accumulation by interrogating a C. elegans model of ATD with high-content genome-wide RNAi screening and computational systems pharmacology strategies. The RNAi screening was utilized to identify genes that modify the intracellular accumulation of ATZ and a novel computational pipeline was developed to make high confidence predictions on repurposable drugs. This approach identified glibenclamide (GLB), a sulfonylurea drug that has been used broadly in clinical medicine as an oral hypoglycemic agent. Here we show that GLB promotes autophagic degradation of misfolded ATZ in mammalian cell line models of ATD. Furthermore, an analog of GLB reduces hepatic ATZ accumulation and hepatic fibrosis in a mouse model in vivo without affecting blood glucose or insulin levels. These results provide support for a drug discovery strategy using simple organisms as human disease models combined with genetic and computational screening methods. They also show that GLB and/or at least one of its analogs can be immediately tested to arrest the progression of human ATD liver disease."

    "abstract": "Objective- Atherosclerotic coronary artery disease is the leading cause of death worldwide, and current treatment options are insufficient. Using systems-level network cluster analyses on a large coronary artery disease case-control cohort, we previously identified PCSK3 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin family member 3; FURIN) as a member of several coronary artery disease-associated pathways. Thus, our objective is to determine the role of FURIN in atherosclerosis. Approach and Results- In vitro, FURIN inhibitor treatment resulted in reduced monocyte migration and reduced macrophage and vascular endothelial cell inflammatory and cytokine gene expression. In vivo, administration of an irreversible inhibitor of FURIN, α-1-PDX (α1-antitrypsin Portland), to hyperlipidemic Ldlr<sup>-/-</sup> mice resulted in lower atherosclerotic lesion area and a specific reduction in severe lesions. Significantly lower lesional macrophage and collagen area, as well as systemic inflammatory markers, were observed. MMP2 (matrix metallopeptidase 2), an effector of endothelial function and atherosclerotic lesion progression, and a FURIN substrate was significantly reduced in the aorta of inhibitor-treated mice. To determine FURIN's role in vascular endothelial function, we administered α-1-PDX to Apoe<sup>-/-</sup> mice harboring a wire injury in the common carotid artery. We observed significantly decreased carotid intimal thickness and lower plaque cellularity, smooth muscle cell, macrophage, and inflammatory marker content, suggesting protection against vascular remodeling. Overexpression of FURIN in this model resulted in a significant 67% increase in intimal plaque thickness, confirming that FURIN levels directly correlate with atherosclerosis. Conclusions- We show that systemic inhibition of FURIN in mice decreases vascular remodeling and atherosclerosis. FURIN-mediated modulation of MMP2 activity may contribute to the atheroprotection observed in these mice."

It is often missed, however, especially in patients with long histories of smoking and alcohol use. This is mainly due to a lack of awareness and proper screening of the disorder, especially in the primary care setting. Here, we will focus on a case report of a young male whose diagnosis and treatment of AATD was significantly delayed. His lung and liver complications had initially been attributed to his smoking and drinking history. This delay could have been avoided by increasing awareness of AATD and through the implementation of novel screening tests that can quickly rule out the disorder in patients presenting with lung and liver disease."

    "abstract": "Lung disease in alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) results from dysregulated proteolytic activity, mainly by neutrophil elastase (HNE), in the lung parenchyma. This is the result of a substantial reduction of circulating alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT) and the presence in the plasma of inactive polymers of AAT. Moreover, some AAT mutants have reduced intrinsic activity toward HNE, as demonstrated for the common Z mutant, as well as for other rarer variants. Here we report the identification and characterisation of the novel AAT reactive centre loop variant Gly349Arg (p.G373R) present in the ExAC database. This AAT variant is secreted at normal levels in cellular models of AATD but shows a severe reduction in anti-HNE activity. Biochemical and molecular dynamics studies suggest it exhibits unfavourable RCL presentation to cognate proteases and compromised insertion of the RCL into β-sheet A. Identification of a fully dysfunctional AAT mutant that does not show a secretory defect underlines the importance of accurate genotyping of patients with pulmonary AATD manifestations regardless of the presence of normal levels of AAT in the circulation. This subtype of disease is reminiscent of dysfunctional phenotypes in anti-thrombin and C1-inibitor deficiencies so, accordingly, we classify this variant as the first pure functionally-deficient (type II) AATD mutant."

    "title": "Relevance of Autophagy in Parenchymal and Non-Parenchymal Liver Cells for Health and Disease.",
    "abstract": "Autophagy is a highly conserved intracellular process for the ordered degradation and recycling of cellular components in lysosomes. In the liver, parenchymal cells (i.e., mainly hepatocytes) utilize autophagy to provide amino acids, glucose, and free fatty acids as sources of energy and biosynthesis functions, but also for recycling and controlling organelles such as mitochondria. Non-parenchymal cells of the liver, including endothelial cells, macrophages (Kupffer cells), and hepatic stellate cells (HSC), also employ autophagy, either for maintaining cellular homeostasis (macrophages, endothelium) or for providing energy for their activation (stellate cells). In hepatocytes, autophagy contributes to essential homeostatic functions (e.g., gluconeogenesis, glycogenolysis, fatty acid oxidation), but is also implicated in diseases. For instance, storage disorders (alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency, Wilson's disease), metabolic (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, NASH), and toxic (alcohol) liver diseases may benefit from augmenting autophagy in hepatocytes. In hepatic fibrosis, autophagy has been implicated in the fibrogenic activation of HSC to collagen-producing myofibroblasts. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), autophagy may contribute to tumor surveillance as well as invasiveness, indicating a dual and stage-dependent function in cancer. As many drugs directly or indirectly modulate autophagy, it is intriguing to investigate autophagy-targeting, possibly even cell type-directed strategies for the treatment of hereditary liver diseases, NASH, fibrosis, and HCC."
