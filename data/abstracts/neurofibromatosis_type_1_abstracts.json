    "title": "Hospital Use, Morbidity, and Cancer Risk by Age Group in Neurofibromatosis Type 1: A Nationwide Retrospective Cohort Study.",
    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) affects multiple organs progressively, leading to a shortened life expectancy. This study aimed to identify the complications that are prominent in each age group by comparing 28,082 patients with NF1 and 84,246 matched controls. Benign and malignant neoplasms along with neurological complications were the primary contributors to hospital use across most age groups. Respiratory and circulatory disorders were a common cause of hospital use in children and older adults, respectively. Except for soft tissue and central nervous system-originated malignancies, which are well-established NF1-related tumours, the highest rate ratios (RR) of malignancies with statistical significance was observed in the adrenal gland (0-9 years, RR 50.67, 95% CI 6.74-380.76); female genital organs (10-14 years, RR 12.06, 95% CI 1.35-107.93); respiratory and intrathoracic organs (15-19 years, RR 15.10, 95% CI 1.76-129.22; 20-29 years, RR 7.59, 95% CI 2.94-19.56; ≥ 60 years, RR 1.38, 95% CI 1.18-1.61); lip, oral cavity, and pharynx (30-39 years, RR 6.11, 95% CI 1.53-24.42); and bone and articular cartilage (40-49 years, RR 3.06, 95% CI 1.37-6.81; 50-59 years, RR 4.73, 95% CI 2.35-9.50). Comorbidities and malignancies that predominantly affect patients vary by age group; physicians should be aware of the appropriate management strategies throughout their lifespan."

    "abstract": "To explore the clinical characteristics and genetic etiology of a child with Neurofibromatosis-Noonan syndrome (NFNS). A child with NFNS who was treated at the Department of Endocrinology of Hangzhou Children's Hospital in January 2024 was selected as the study subject. Clinical data of the child was collected by retrospective analysis. Peripheral venous blood samples (2 mL each) were collected from the child and his parents. Genomic DNA was extracted, and trio-whole exome sequencing (Trio-WES) of the family was carried out. Sanger sequencing was used to perform family verification on the candidate variants. The identified variants were classified for pathogenicity according to the Standards and Guidelines for the Interpretation of Sequence Variants established by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) (hereafter referred to as the \"ACMG guidelines\"). This study has been approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Hangzhou Children's Hospital (Ethics No. 2021-06). The child was a 7-year and 4-month-old male. He has short stature, numerous café-au-lait spots on the neck and trunk, and special facial features such as a full forehead, wide interpupillary distance, a low nasal bridge, and low-set ears. The results of Trio-WES showed that the he had harbored the NF1 gene c.3773G>T (p.W1258L) mutation, which was verified by Sanger sequencing to be de novo in origin. The NF1 gene was associated with NFNS, which has an autosomal dominant inheritance. According to the ACMG guidelines, this variant was judged to be a likely pathogenic variant (PS2+PM2+PP3+PP2). No pathogenic variant in genes associated with Noonan syndrome, such as PTPN11, SOS1, RAF1, RIT1, and KRAS, was found. The child with NFNS has clinical features such as short stature, special facial features, and café-au-lait spots. The c.3773G>T (p.W1258L) variation in the NF1 gene may be the genetic etiology of the NFNS child in this study. The results of this study has enriched the variation spectrum of the NF1 gene."

    "title": "Coexistence of Congenital Aniridia and Ptosis in a Patient with Neurofibromatosis Type I: A Case Report.",
    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the <i>NF1</i> gene on chromosome 17q11.2. The main ocular manifestations include Lisch nodules, optic pathway gliomas, and plexiform neurofibromas, all of which can potentially impair visual function. Despite the numerous documented ocular manifestations of NF1, congenital aniridia has never been previously reported. Aniridia is a rare congenital disorder primarily associated with mutations in the <i>PAX6</i> gene, leading to iris hypoplasia, corneal pannus, cataracts, and glaucoma. <i>PAX6</i>-negative aniridia has been described in some cases, suggesting alternative genetic mechanisms. Additionally, a minority of patients with aniridia exhibit ptosis. We present a unique case of a 50-year-old woman with NF1, exhibiting bilateral congenital aniridia and ptosis, without <i>PAX6</i> mutations. A 50-year-old woman diagnosed with NF1 presented with bilateral congenital ptosis and aniridia. Genetic analysis confirmed the presence of the <i>NF1</i> c.4537C>T variant but was negative for <i>PAX6</i> mutations. Ophthalmological examination revealed total aniridia, cataract, ptosis, and pendular nystagmus. The patient underwent levator muscle resection for ptosis correction and cataract extraction with implantation of an intraocular lens with an iris prosthesis. Histopathological analysis of the levator muscle showed atrophic changes in the absence of neurofibromatous infiltration. This case represents the first documented instance of bilateral congenital aniridia in a patient with NF1. The absence of <i>PAX6</i> mutations suggests an alternative genetic mechanism or a novel NF1 phenotype. This highlights the importance of thorough ophthalmologic and genetic evaluation in NF1 patients, integrating a multidisciplinary approach to identify atypical phenotypic associations and ensure optimal management."

    "title": "Solitary Plexiform Neurofibroma in the Urachus Associated With von Recklinghausen's Disease.",
    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), also known as von Recklinghausen's disease, is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by multiple café-au-lait macules and cutaneous neurofibromas. Although neurofibromas are common in NF1, involvement of the urinary tract is rare, with the bladder being the most frequently affected site. Urachal neurofibromas are extremely rare, and their diagnosis and management remain challenging due to nonspecific imaging characteristics and their often asymptomatic presentation. We report the case of a 30-year-old man with clinical features of NF1 in whom a 5-cm mass at the bladder dome was incidentally identified on MRI performed during evaluation for spinal cord symptoms. Imaging revealed a cone-shaped mass in the urachal region, and cystoscopy showed no mucosal abnormalities. Urinalysis and urine cytology were unremarkable. A transabdominal needle biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of a neurofibroma. Given the tumor's size (>5 cm) and deep-seated location in the trunk, both known risk factors for malignant transformation, surgical excision was performed, including resection of the urachus and bilateral umbilical ligaments. Histopathological analysis confirmed a plexiform neurofibroma consistent with NF1. The postoperative course was uneventful, with no evidence of recurrence during 36 months of follow-up. This case highlights the rare presentation of a urachal plexiform neurofibroma in a patient with NF1. To reduce the potential risk of malignant transformation associated with plexiform neurofibromas larger than 5 cm and located in deep trunk regions, accurate diagnosis and timely surgical intervention are essential, even in asymptomatic cases."

    "abstract": "Plexiform neurofibromas (PNFs) are benign tumors of the peripheral nervous system that represent a major source of morbidity in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). A substantial proportion of patients do not respond to current therapies or experience intolerable side effects. Transcriptomic characterization of murine and human PNF at bulk and single-cell resolution identified transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) signaling as a key upstream regulator, driving aberrant basement membrane (BM) protein production by neoplastic Schwann cells and Fbs. Conditional TGFβ1 overexpression in <i>Nf1</i>-deficient Schwann cells driven by <i>Hoxb7-</i>Cre promoted PNF growth and malignant transformation in vivo. Conversely, pharmacologic inhibition of the type I TGFβ receptor (TGFβRI) reduced PNF tumor burden in <i>Nf1</i> mutant mice. Proteomic characterization of the extracellular matrix (ECM) showed reduced BM proteins upon TGFβRI inhibition. These findings implicate TGFβ as a potential therapeutic target in PNF and provide insights into the role of TGFβ signaling in orchestrating ECM dynamics in the PNF microenvironment."

    "abstract": "Spinal meningoceles are congenital anomalies characterized by meningeal herniation through vertebral defects, most commonly occurring in the lumbosacral region. Intrathoracic meningoceles are rare and are typically associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1). True anterior thoracic meningoceles unassociated with NF-1 represent exceptionally rare clinical entities. This is a retrospective case report. We report a 15-year-old female with severe kyphoscoliosis and a non-NF-1-associated anterior thoracic meningocele who presented with progressive spastic paraparesis. Imaging examinations revealed thoracolumbar scoliosis with 100-degree kyphotic angulation, midline anterior spina bifida at T7, and a well-defined cystic structure exhibiting hypointense T1 and hyperintense T2 signals (measuring 5.7×4.5 cm) anterior to the T7-T8 vertebral bodies. Surgical intervention included posterior spinal laminar decompression, T7 vertebral osteotomy, microscopic dural sac reduction, and stabilization using a pedicle screw system with autologous bone grafting. The patient was discharged without any complications 12 days after surgery, and at the 12-month follow-up, the patient achieved ambulation with a walker and leg brace. This case underscores the necessity of tailored surgical strategies for anterior thoracic meningoceles complicated by severe spinal deformities. The integration of microsurgical techniques and 3D-printed anatomical modeling may optimize procedural safety and functional outcomes."

    "abstract": "Many RASopathies can be clinically diagnosed based on their cutaneous findings, thus it is essential for dermatologists to be comfortable differentiating RASopathies for accurate diagnosis and appropriate management. Employing the same framework to categorize as in Part I, the most common RASopathies include those principally caused by genetic variants in tumor suppressor genes (neurofibromatosis type 1, Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines, Legius syndrome, capillary malformation-arteriovenous malformation syndrome), those principally due to variants in oncogenes (Noonan syndrome, Costello syndrome, cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome), and mosaic conditions such as sebaceous nevus syndrome, neurocutaneous melanosis, McCune-Albright syndrome, phakomatosis pigmentokeratotica, epidermal nevus syndrome, and encephalocraniocutaneous lipomatosis. Germline variants cause systemic disease and must be managed in conjunction with a multidisciplinary team of specialists for holistic care. Common extracutaneous manifestations affect the neurologic, psychiatric, cardiac, ocular, musculoskeletal, genitourinary, and hematologic systems. The genetic basis of disease necessitates family counseling with a geneticist and patient support groups. It is also important to recognize risk of cancer in RASopathy patients for appropriate surveillance. Thus, dermatologists play a critical role in patients' healthcare through familiarity with and prompt diagnosis of RASopathies."

    "title": "Using Durometers to Quantify Stiffness as an Outcome Measure for Cutaneous Neurofibroma in Neurofibromatosis Type 1.",
    "abstract": "Patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 develop multiple cutaneous neurofibromas (cNFs) for which no effective drug therapy exists; mainstay treatment remains physical removal. However, clinical trials testing new drugs are ongoing, and quantitative techniques based on cNF biology are needed to measure changes in cNF after treatment. cNF tumor bulk is composed of extracellular matrix and inflammatory cells that dictate their stiffness. No studies have reported measuring the stiffness change in neurofibromas, which would indicate shrinking of the tumor bulk. The goal of this study was to evaluate 2 different instruments-the Rex Gauge durometer (denoted as REX) and the Delfin SkinFibroMeter (denoted as DELFIN)-in reproducibly measuring cNF stiffness. Ninety-seven neurofibromas from patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 on different skin areas were measured at each of 2 visits about 2 weeks apart. The DELFIN had moderate within-tumor agreement (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.607, 95% confidence interval = 0.512-0.691) and moderate within-visit agreement (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.732, 95% confidence interval = 0.665-0.786), and the REX had moderate within-tumor agreement (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.740, 95% confidence interval = 0.631-0.816) and excellent within-visit agreement (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.937, 95% confidence interval = 0.913-0.953), while accounting for repeated visits and tumor measurements clustered within each patient. We found that both the DELFIN and REX are easy to use and reliable, providing consistent quantification of cNF stiffness."

    "abstract": "Malignant triton tumors (MTTs) are rare tumors histologically defined as malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors with additional rhabdomyoblastic differentiation. MTTs occur more frequently in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). MTTs are most commonly found in the extremities, head and neck, and trunk; however, no cases in the mesentery have been reported. In this report, we describe a case of primary MTT of the mesentery in a patient with NF1. A 29-year-old woman with NF1 visited a clinic for abdominal pain and was referred to our hospital for treatment of an abdominal tumor detected by CT. Contrast-enhanced CT showed a 20-cm irregular mass on the right side of the abdominal cavity. The mass was extensively bordered by the superior mesenteric vein (SMV), but there was no obvious distant metastasis. The patient was diagnosed with a mesenteric tumor with SMV invasion. An open biopsy was performed, and the histopathological diagnosis was MTT. The patient was discharged on the 11th day after surgery but returned to our hospital on the 17th day due to abdominal pain. The tumor had markedly enlarged on CT, and a semi-emergent tumor resection was performed. An enlarged mass was detected, but no peritoneal dissemination was observed. The tumor was in extensive contact with the SMV, but it could be dissected. A right hemicolectomy was performed, and the tumor was removed. Histopathological findings revealed a 26.5 × 17.5 × 9.5 cm tumor in the ileocolic mesentery. The dissected surface was negative for margins, with no exposed tumors. The histopathological diagnosis was MTT. Follow-up CT on postoperative day 14 revealed multiple peritoneal nodules. The patient was diagnosed with recurrent peritoneal dissemination and treated with two courses of doxorubicin and one course of pazopanib. However, she died 5 months postoperatively due to worsening peritonitis carcinomatosis. We present a case of primary MTT of the mesentery. Our findings suggest that biopsy may lead to peritoneal dissemination. In patients with suspected MTT, such as those with NF1, abdominal cavity biopsy should be avoided, and diagnostic treatment should prioritize surgical resection."

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a neurogenetic disorder caused by loss of function mutations in the gene neurofibromin 1 ( <i>NF1</i> ). <i>NF1</i> encodes neurofibromin, a multifunctional tumor suppressing protein that regulates Ras, cAMP, and dopamine signaling. NF1 predisposes patients to a wide range of symptoms, including peripheral nerve tumors, brain tumors, and cognitive dysfunction. Despite considerable work using animal models to investigate the role of neurofibromin in behavior, translating research into treatment for NF1-associated cognitive dysfunction has not yet been successful. Here, we identify Cxcr4 chemokine receptor signaling as a regulator of habituation learning and modulator of cAMP-PKA signaling in <i>nf1</i> mutant larval zebrafish. Combining a small-molecule drug screen and RNAseq analysis, we show that <i>cxcr4b</i> expression is increased in <i>nf1</i> mutants and that pharmacological inhibition of Cxcr4 with AMD3100 (Plerixafor) improves habituation learning in <i>nf1</i> mutants. We further demonstrate that Plerixafor treatment activates cAMP-PKA pathway signaling but has limited effects on Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK pathway signaling in the <i>nf1</i> mutant brain. CXCR4 was previously identified as a potential therapeutic target for neurofibromin-deficient tumorigenesis. Our results provide evidence that Cxcr4 signaling also regulates neurofibromin-dependent cognitive function."

Gene therapy using adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector mediated gene delivery is a promising strategy to treat these diseases. However, AAV-mediated transduction of SCs in vivo after intravascular delivery is relatively inefficient, with a lack of extensive characterization of different capsids to date. Here, we performed an in vivo selection with an AAV9 capsid peptide display library in a mouse model of NF1. We chose one capsid variant, AAV-SC3, which was present in NF1 nerves for comparison to two benchmark capsids after systemic injection. AAV-SC3 significantly outperformed one of the two benchmark capsids at levels of transgene mRNA in the neurofibroma. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed transgene expressing Sox10-positive SCs throughout the neurofibroma with AAV-SC3 injection. Next, we performed a pooled screen with four of the top capsids from our initial selection and AAV9 and identified one capsid, AAV-SC4, with enhanced biodistribution to and transduction of normal sciatic nerve in mice. This capsid displayed a peptide with a known laminin-binding motif, which may provide a conduit for future laminin-targeting strategies. Our results provide a baseline for future AAV-based gene therapies developed for NF1 or other diseases that affect SCs."

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 is a genetic disease with an autosomal dominant pattern. One of its clinical features is the presence of disfiguring neurofibromas. Most adults with Neurofibromatosis type 1 have visible neurofibromas depending on the severity of their skin related clinic that can affect their body image, and body image influencing psychological assistance and social support. This research explored Body image, the negative perception of the appearance of neurofibromas and skin severity in Neurofibromatosis type 1 patients; assessed its association with quality of life; and the role of social support and psychological assistance. Two hundred five patients with Neurofibromatosis type 1 (16-74 years) were included in the study. They responded to questionnaires about their quality of life, body image and other sociodemographic data. Correlations and simple and multiple regressions were used to assess the relationships between variables. The results showed that body image problems increased if Neurofibromatosis type 1 patients were concerned about the aspects of their neurofibromas (B = 4.544; p < 0.001) and if they had severe skin conditions (B = 4.262; p < .001). Despite this, statistical analysis showed that only body image impairments reduced quality of life by 0.605 (p < 0.001), while skin severity and the negative perception of the appearance of neurofibromas were not clearly related. Patients with body image impairments are more likely to seek psychological assistance (ρ = 0.218; p < 0.01), but they are less likely to report having social support. The results also showed that when patients with Neurofibromatosis type 1 retrieved they have social support (ρ = -0.210, p < 0.01) or they inform doing psychological assistance (ρ = -0.238; p < 0.001), they have lower quality of life. Body image concerns, rather than skin severity, are a key feature for detecting quality of life impairments in these patients. When healthcare professionals detect body image impairments, it is crucial for them to collaborate with patients and either provide or refer them to psychological interventions. This approach helps improve social support, enabling patients to benefit from both their professional and personal environments."

The KOMET study aimed to evaluate selumetinib (ARRY-142886, AZD6244) efficacy and safety in this population. This ongoing multicentre, international, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 3, parallel, double-blind trial randomly assigned adults with NF1-plexiform neurofibroma 1:1 to 28-day cycles of oral selumetinib 25 mg/m<sup>2</sup> twice daily, or placebo with crossover to selumetinib at confirmed radiological progression or the end of cycle 12. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (confirmed partial or complete response) established by use of independent central review per Response Evaluation in Neurofibromatosis and Schwannomatosis (REiNS) criteria by cycle 16 (selumetinib vs placebo). This study (KOMET) is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04924608 and is ongoing. Overall, of 184 participants enrolled, 145 adults were randomly assigned to selumetinib (n=71) or placebo (n=74). Selumetinib led to a rapid response (median 3·7 months), with an objective response rate of 20% (n=14/71; 95% CI 11·2 to 30·9) by cycle 16 versus 5% (n=4/74; 1·5 to 13·3) with placebo (p=0·011). Participants with baseline chronic pain intensity scores of at least 3 had a greater reduction in score at cycle 12 with selumetinib versus placebo (least-squares mean [SE] -2·0 [0·30] -2·6 to -1·4, vs -1·3 [0·29] -1·8 to -0·7; p=0·070), although this did not reach significance; and a clinically meaningful improvement from baseline. Change from baseline to cycle 12 in PlexiQoL total scores between treatment groups was not significant (least-squares mean difference [SE] -0·1 [0·59]; -1·2 to 1·1). Adverse events were consistent with the known selumetinib safety profile. In the first international, randomised, placebo-controlled trial in adults with NF1-plexiform neurofibromas, selumetinib achieved a significant objective response rate versus placebo. No new safety concerns were identified. The observations of reduction in tumour volume by cycle 16, reduction in chronic and spike pain, reduction in analgesia, and decrease in pain interference over placebo show that selumetinib is effective at treating plexiform neurofibromas in adults with NF1.

NF1 negatively impacts the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of children. There is limited evidence regarding the determinants of HRQoL of children with NF1. The aim of this study was to (i) compare the HRQoL of children with NF1 and cognitive impairments to published data of healthy children and children with cancer and (ii) identify specific determinants of child and parent-proxy reports of psychosocial HRQoL. Children with NF1 and cognitive impairments (n = 135, 8-15 years 11 months) and their parents completed standardized measures assessing children's HRQoL, behavioral and emotional functioning. Children completed a brief intelligence test. Correlations and multiple linear regressions were conducted to identify determinants of psychosocial HRQoL. Children with NF1 had significantly poorer HRQoL for all domains than published data of healthy children and significantly poorer HRQoL for Psychosocial Health, School and Social Functioning than published data of children with cancer. For child self-report, attention problems and increased social stress predicted their psychosocial HRQoL. For parent-proxy reports, activities of daily living and depression were significant predictors of children's psychosocial HRQoL. Social stress and depression were the strongest predictors of Psychosocial HRQoL. Routine screening and early identification of depressive symptoms and interventions that promote social support, coping and resiliency may improve the HRQoL of children with NF1."

    "abstract": "Growth hormone excess (GHE) in children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1) has been reported in some cases. The prevalence of GHE in NF-1 has not been described and treatment with long-acting somatostatin analogues (SSA) has not been well characterized. To describe in children with NF-1/OPG the prevalence of GHE, and response to SSA. From 379 children with NF-1, 80 were diagnosed of OPG (21%). In a prospective follow up 8.7% were identified as having GHE; all were prepubertal, with a mean age of 4.4±1.9 years. The mean height was + 0.86 ± 0.76 SD above the mid parental height; growth velocity +4.07 SD, mean IGF-1 > 1SD (457.8±151.3 ng/mL). In 4 patients the GHE was observed during tumor progression. The first two patients were initially treated with short- acting somatostatin analogues (SSA) (1.5 μg/kg/day). After confirming tolerability, it was replaced by long- acting somatostatin analogues (SSA) (10 mg/28 days). Four were initially treated with (10 mg/28 d). 6/7 patients showed a normalization of IGF-1 and growth velocity. Treatment could be withdrawn in all patients after 19.9 ± 4.6 months. The patients remained stable for 48 months (24-60). Except for mild diarrhea, no other adverse events were observed. We should consider the risk GHE in patients with NF-1-OPG, as this may be a cause for concern indicating tumour progression. Treatment with long-acting somatostatin analogues (SSA) was effective and safe. After treatment, the patients' growth and analytical parameters remained within normal range, confirming the reversibility of growth hormone excess."

    "abstract": "Café-au-lait macules (CALMs) are common skin manifestations, and their number and distribution may indicate potential genetic disorders, such as Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1). This study aimed to investigate the clinical characteristics of multiple CALMs and their significance in the early screening of genetic disorders. This retrospective study included 98 patients diagnosed between May 2021 and May 2024 in two hospitals. Patients were divided into three groups based on the number of CALMs and whether other skin manifestations were present: Group 1 (≥ 6 CALMs with other skin manifestations), Group 2 (≥ 6 CALMs without other skin manifestations), and Group 3 (< 6 CALMs without other skin manifestations). Detailed clinical evaluations and imaging examinations were conducted to record the number, size, distribution of CALMs, and associated symptoms. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to explore the relationship between CALMs and other systemic symptoms. Group 1 patients showed significantly higher incidences of neurological symptoms (eg, neurofibromas 54%, P < 0.001) and skeletal system symptoms (eg, bone deformities 38%, P = 0.001) compared to Groups 2 and 3. Imaging examinations revealed an abnormality rate of 90% in Group 1 (P < 0.001). Logistic regression analysis indicated that the number of CALMs (≥ 10) was significantly associated with neurological (OR = 7.664, P = 0.001) and skeletal system symptoms (OR = 4.623, P = 0.014). The distribution of CALMs on the face and neck also showed a certain influence on symptoms. The number and distribution of CALMs are significant in the early screening of genetic diseases, particularly in identifying patients with potential neurological and skeletal system abnormalities."

    "abstract": "Congenital pseudarthrosis of the tibia (CPT, HP:0009736), commonly known as bowing of the tibia, is a rare congenital tibia malformation characterized by spontaneous tibial fractures and difficulty in reunion after tibial fractures during early childhood, with a prevalence between 1/250,000 and 1/140,000. While 80%-84% of CPT cases present with neurofibromatosis type 1, caused by the variations in the NF1 gene, the underlying cause of CPT remains unclear. Considering its congenital nature and the low prevalence, we hypothesized that the rare genomic protein-damaging variations may contribute to CPT. In this study, we conducted whole exome sequencing on 159 patients with CPT and found loss-of-function (LoF) excesses in the 159 patient cases compared to 208 healthy controls from the 1000 Genomes Project. The LoF variant types primarily included stop-gained and frameshift variants, both present in 97% of the 159 patients with CPT, as well as splice-changing variants, which were found in 78% of these patients. Rare LoF variations in osteocyte-related pathways, such as ossification, were identified in 112 of the 159 CPT cases (70.4%). The top seven genes carrying rare protein-damaging variants that might be related to CPT are NF1, GLI3, MRC2, PTH1R, RYR1, NPR2 and ITGA11. These findings shed light on novel genetic mutations and osteocyte transcriptome-related molecular pathways involved in CPT, providing a new framework for understanding the genetic regulation of CPT pathology and suggesting potential directions to further elucidate its pathogenesis."

    "abstract": "Selumetinib (SEL) is a recently approved medication for paediatric patients who have neurofibromatosis type 1. It is the first approved therapy for this rare, debilitating, and disfiguring disease. Development of proper analytical platforms for SEL analysis in its marketed pharmaceutical formulation (Koselugo<sup>®</sup> capsules) and blood plasma is highly warranted. Availability of such analytical tools would ensure SEL capsules' quality and effective therapy. This study introduces, for the first time, the development of two label-free and sensitive platforms for SEL quantification in capsules and human plasma. These platforms are microwave-assisted with an ultraviolet absorbance microplate reader (MW-UV) and reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography with a photodiode-array detector (HPLC-PDA). Both platforms employed the SEL native UV absorption as an analytical signal. The MW-UV measured the UV absorption in 96-well transparent plates at 255 nm. The HPLC-PDA involved chromatographic separation of SEL and tozasertib (TOZ), internal standard, on a C18 column both were detected at 255 nm. The optimum procedures of both platforms were established and validated following the ICH guidelines. The linearity ranges were 15-500 μg mL<sup>-1</sup> and 0.8-100 μg mL<sup>-1</sup>, with limits of quantification of 15.3 and 3.5 μg mL<sup>-1</sup>, for MW-UV and HPLC-PDA, resp. Both platforms displayed high precision with relative standard deviation values ≤ 1.8 %, and high accuracy with recovery ranging from 98.3 to 102.3 %. The platforms were successfully applied to quantify SEL in bulk form, Koselugo<sup>®</sup> capsules, and were preliminarily applied to human plasma analysis. Eco-friendliness assessment confirmed the adherence of both platforms to green analytical approaches. MW-UV and HPLC-PDA are simple and fast, enabling high-throughput analysis, thus introducing valuable tools for routine use in quality control and clinical laboratories for SEL quantification."

The clinical presentation of NF1 in patients in the Republic of Bashkortostan with brain damage, as well as the accessibility of specialized care were analyzed. The mean age was 30.6 years (8 months to 85 years). The ratio of females to males was 1:1. The ethnic composition of patients corresponds to the general population in the republic. The prevalence of NF1 in the republic was 13.5 per 100.000 population. Cognitive deficits have been identified in 15% of NF1 patients (of which 75% were severe); 6% have optic gliomas, 5% have brain cysts, 4.23% have hydrocephalus, 3.86% have brain tumors, and 3.7% have epilepsy. Learning difficulties and optic nerve gliomas were significantly rarer compared to the worldwide data. Possible reasons for the lower detectability of cognitive deficits may be doctors' insufficient alertness, a shortage of psychologists and neurologists, and social factors. There is no data on the psychological disorders in NF1 patients in the republic; however, a high prevalence of brain cysts was revealed. Optic nerve gliomas, epilepsy, and short stature in patients with cognitive deficits are statistically significantly more common. The analysis of the availability of specialized care showed a sufficient number of geneticists in the country and difficulties in timely using instrumental research methods (MRI) and consultations with neurologists, ophthalmologists, psychologists, and psychotherapists. The results indicate the need for accessible brain MRI and consultations with neurologists, psychologists, and psychotherapists for all NF1 patients in the republic to detect brain lesions and psychological disorders in a timely manner. The detection of brain cysts in 5% of patients may be specific to the NF1 region."

Early diagnosis is crucial to prevent recurrence and metastasis. We report a 78-year-old male with a rapidly enlarging right nasal cavity mass over 4 months, associated with recurrent epistaxis. His medical history included diabetes, hypertension, and tobacco use. Examination revealed a firm, non-adherent mass obstructing the nasal cavity. Computed tomography (CT) imaging localized it to the right inferior turbinate. Due to size and location, biopsy was not performed. Surgical resection confirmed a high-grade MPNST (FNCLCC grade 3). Chemotherapy was initiated postoperatively, but the patient passed away soon after, highlighting the tumor's aggressiveness. MPNSTs should be considered in nasal mass differentials, especially in elderly smokers. Early surgery and chemotherapy may improve outcomes, emphasizing the need for a multidisciplinary approach."

A 62-question online cross-sectional survey, available in English and Spanish, was distributed to South Carolina residents over age 18 years who were either adults who do not have NF1 but have children with NF1, adults with NF1 who have children with NF1, and adults with NF1 who do not have children or may have children without NF1, to capture a wide range of experiences. Survey responses were analyzed using descriptive statistics to summarize key findings and chi-squared and Fisher's exact tests for categorical comparisons. Free-text responses were examined by content analysis and evaluated by a second researcher. A total of 52 survey responses were analyzed. 90.4% indicated that a specialty clinic should exist in South Carolina. More than 70% of participants reported adherence to medical advice for NF1 and saw a doctor at least once per year, with children and adults seeing several relevant specialists. Analysis of free text responses revealed that participants perceive limited resources and awareness for NF1 in South Carolina, with 4 key gaps identified in both education and clinical care. Establishing a dedicated, multidisciplinary care center for individuals with NF1 in South Carolina can address 3 out of the 4 clinical care gaps and 1 out of the 4 education gaps identified by the content analysis and is highly supported by participant preference."

This study outlines the establishment of an international neuro-oncology tumor board to address these gaps. The tumor board was initiated in January 2021 through a partnership between Washington University in St. Louis, USA, and nine institutions, ultimately expanding to 39 institutions across 25 countries. Monthly virtual meetings facilitated multi-disciplinary case reviews offering diagnostic and management recommendations. A retrospective analysis of 29 sessions over three years was conducted, and a cross-sectional web-based survey among participants assessed their experiences and satisfaction. From January 2021 to December 2023, 101 cases were reviewed. The most diagnoses were low-grade gliomas (23.4%) and neurofibromatosis type 1 and 2 (32.7%). Newly diagnosed cases comprised 51%, while 40% involved recurrent or progressive disease, and 9% were inquiries during ongoing therapy. Recommendations predominantly addressed therapeutic strategies (60.7%). Advanced diagnostics, such as methylation profiling, refined diagnoses in several cases. The survey, with a 35% response rate, showed high satisfaction, with 91% finding the meetings educational. Barriers included time constraints (71%) and conflicting commitments (27%). This initiative, to our knowledge, represents the largest international pediatric neuro-oncology tumor board. Multidisciplinary discussions improved diagnostic precision, informed therapeutic decision-making and facilitated educational exchange. Participants reported positive impacts on professional development and alignment with institutional needs. Despite challenges, this study highlights telemedicine's potential to bridge resource disparities and improve the outcomes globally."

At the beginning of the study, linkage analysis was challenging. However, our efforts finally achieved statistically significant results at locus 17q25 with a logarithm of odds(LOD) score of 3.11, a maximum LOD score of 4.58, and p-value of 0.00001 with parametric linkage analysis, multipoint analysis, and nonparametric Affected Pedigree Member analysis, respectively. This was due to the good fortune of choosing chromosome 17 as the primary target, given that neurofibromatosis type 1 and moyamoya disease occur simultaneously in some cases. Moreover, our success was largely due to the contributions of our collaborators who precisely determined the disease traits and collected DNA(leukocyte) samples from 103 individuals from 24 families. After our publication in 2000, a research group from Kyoto University searched for the locus 17q25.3 and discovered a mutation in <i>RNF213</i> gene. Simultaneously, a group from Tohoku University performed a genome-wide association study and determined <i>RNF213</i> to be a susceptibility gene for moyamoya disease.

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a genetic disorder characterised by skin and nervous system anomalies, primarily involving glial cells and nerve tumours. Pain, particularly chronic pain, is a significant but often overlooked symptom in NF1 patients, affecting their health-related quality of life. The dorsal root ganglion (DRG) is essential for pain signal transmission, yet in vivo studies of DRG in NF1 patients are lacking. This prospective study included 20 NF1 patients (8 with neuropathic pain) and 28 healthy controls. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of lumbosacral DRG (L5 + S1) were performed using a 3-T scanner. Quantitative MRI techniques were applied to assess DRG volume, T2 relaxation time, and proton density (PD). Statistical analyses compared NF1 patients and controls, and NF1 patients with and without pain. NF1 patients had a significantly larger DRG volume and higher quantitative T2 and PD values compared to controls. Furthermore, DRG PD was significantly higher in NF1 patients with neuropathic pain than in those without pain. Receiver operator characteristic curve analysis identified DRG PD as the best discriminator of pain in NF1 patients, with an area under the curve of 0.84, indicating relevant and useful discriminatory power. NF1 patients showed objective macrostructural and microstructural DRG injury changes using dedicated DRG MRI, discriminating neuropathic pain status from non-pain status at the disease-symptom group level. These findings highlight the potential of DRG MRI to quantify DRG pathology in vivo and to determine the risk of functional pain status by imaging. The identification of structural and microstructural changes of the DRG by quantitative MRI provides a novel in vivo biomarker for understanding neuropathic pain mechanisms, pain risk assessment and treatment monitoring in NF1. Dorsal root ganglia (DRG) in NF1 are enlarged by 176.3% in MRI. In quantitative MRI of DRG NF1, T2 relaxation time is increased by 22.9% and PD by 8.4%. DRG PD can distinguish a painful from a non-painful NF1 phenotype."

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in the <i>NF1</i> gene, typically diagnosed during early childhood and characterized by significant phenotypic heterogeneity. Despite advancements in next-generation sequencing (NGS), the diagnostic process remains challenging due to the gene's complexity, high mutational burden, and frequent identification of variants of uncertain significance (VUS). This review explores the emerging role of artificial intelligence (AI) in enhancing <i>NF1</i> variant detection, classification, and interpretation. A systematic literature search was conducted across PubMed, IEEE Xplore, Google Scholar, and ResearchGate to identify recent studies applying AI technologies to <i>NF1</i> genetic analysis, focusing on variant interpretation, structural modeling, tumor classification, and therapeutic prediction. The review highlights the application of AI-based tools such as VEST3, REVEL, ClinPred, and <i>NF1</i>-specific models like DITTO and RENOVO-NF1, which have demonstrated improved accuracy in classifying missense variants and reclassifying VUS. Structural modeling platforms like AlphaFold contribute further insights into the impact of <i>NF1</i> mutations on neurofibromin structure and function. In addition, deep learning models, such as LTC neural networks, support tumor classification and therapeutic outcome prediction, particularly in <i>NF1</i>-associated complications like congenital pseudarthrosis of the tibia (CPT). The integration of AI methodologies offers substantial potential to improve diagnostic precision, enable early intervention, and support personalized medicine approaches. However, key challenges remain, including algorithmic bias, limited data diversity, and the need for functional validation. Ongoing refinement and clinical validation of these tools are essential to ensure their effective implementation and equitable use in NF1 diagnostics."

Retrospective analysis was undertaken of 75 individuals with a diagnosis of both neurofibromatosis type 1 and optic pathway gliomas, known to a single quaternary neurofibromatosis type 1 center, over a 20-year period. Central precocious puberty was more likely with optic pathway gliomas, observed in 28% of the cohort, and was associated with either optic chiasm involvement (<i>P</i> = .046) or bilateral optic pathway gliomas (<i>P</i> < .001). This is presumably due to disruption in the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. Height standard deviation scores were not significantly different from the general population.

It is caused by variations in the <i>NF1</i> gene located on chromosome 17q11.2. The gene's complexity and extensive variations often lead to misdiagnoses by conventional detection methods, which adverses to effective diagnosis and treatment strategies. A 26-year-old Chinese woman was admitted to our hospital with multiple café-au-lait spots and cutaneous nodules. She had a family history of NF1, with her mother also showing similar dermatological symptoms. Whole exome sequencing (WES) identified a synonymous variation, NM_001042492.3: c.987A>G (p.K329K), in the <i>NF1</i> gene. Although synonymous variations are typically considered non-pathogenic, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and minigene analysis revealed that this variation caused the partial loss of exon 9, leading to aberrant splicing. These findings were validated through Sanger sequencing, confirming the genetic alteration and its impact on mRNA splicing. The case highlights the critical role of synonymous variations in the <i>NF1</i> gene that significantly impact splicing and protein function. These findings expand our understanding of <i>NF1</i>'s genetic diversity and underscore the importance of comprehensive genetic and RNA analyses to achieve accurate diagnosis and in-depth insight into the molecular underpinnings of NF1."

    "abstract": "To identify the genetic variants underlying neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and to investigate genotype-phenotype correlations. Thirty-three patients from 27 Chinese pedigrees with suspected NF1 phenotypes underwent genetic analysis. The impact of splicing variant on NF1 mRNA processing was determined by cDNA direct sequencing. Additional NF1 patients with detailed clinical and molecular data were extracted from the literature for performing genotype-phenotype correlation analysis. Genetic analysis identified 24 distinct NF1 variants: nine frameshift, four nonsense, four missense, six splice site, and one exon deletion. Among them, 10 were previously unreported in the literature. A functional study showed that the canonical splicing variant (c.3497-2 A > G) resulted in an in-frame deletion of two amino acids, which may not affect protein function. Finally, 22 variants were classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic. After evaluation of the clinical data and genetic evidence, the diagnoses of 31 patients from 25 families were confirmed. Genotype-phenotype correlation analysis from the cohort, consisting of 28 patients in this study and 235 published cases, showed that the onset of neurofibromas and bone lesions exhibited an age-dependent association, with 79.8% and 73.8% probability of developing in patients older than 23.5 years or 20.5 years, respectively. No association was found between the location or type of NF1 variants and any specific features. We comprehensively described the clinical and genetic data of a Chinese NF1 cohort and emphasized the necessity of further functional analysis on splicing variants. Neurofibromas and bone lesions are age-dependent disease complications that exhibit progressive tendencies with increasing age in patients with NF1."

While advances have been made in understanding pain associated with NF, particularly for NF1, NF2, and schwannomatosis, significant gaps in treatment and understanding remain. Future research should prioritize targeted therapies and improved pain management strategies to enhance the quality of life for NF patients."

    "title": "Recent Advancement of Neurofibromatosis Type 1: A Narrative Review.",
    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a complex autosomal dominant genetic disorder caused by mutations in the NF1 gene on chromosome 17, which encodes the tumor-suppressor protein, neurofibromin. Neurofibromin plays a critical role in regulating the RAS signaling pathway, and its loss leads to uncontrolled cell proliferation and tumor development. Clinically, NF1 presents with variable manifestations, including café-au-lait spots, neurofibromas, optic gliomas, skeletal abnormalities, and cognitive deficits. The updated diagnostic criteria now incorporate genetic testing and choroidal anomalies, facilitating earlier and more accurate diagnoses. Recent molecular insights have revealed that neurofibromin interacts with multiple cellular pathways, contributing to diverse clinical presentations such as plexiform neurofibromas, which may transform into malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, and developmental issues such as scoliosis and learning disabilities. Current therapeutic approaches focus on targeting specific signaling molecules involved in tumorigenesis. This review aims to summarize the recent findings on the clinical features, molecular mechanisms, and potential treatments of NF1, offering a comprehensive understanding of the disorder's complexities and highlighting future research directions."

    "title": "Nipple-Areolar Complex Neurotization Following Nipple-sparing Mastectomy and Breast Reconstruction for Solitary Breast Neurofibroma.",
    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a rare clinical entity when associated with breast tumors. Women diagnosed with NF1 are 5 times more likely to develop breast cancer from a preexisting neurofibroma lesion. Previous studies have recommended earlier breast cancer screening starting at age 30 for NF1 patients. Morbidity associated with NF1 lesions include pain, paresthesia, and motor deficits, which contribute to a decreased quality of life. Although breast involvement is rare, the most common location of neurofibromas involving the breast is the nipple-areolar complex (NAC). Mastectomy incision type and management of the NAC have not been well studied in NF1 patients with NAC-sparing breast neurofibromas. The purpose of this case report is to describe a 23-year-old woman with a severe breast deformity diagnosed with NF1 who underwent nipple-sparing mastectomy with immediate latissimus flap reconstruction and nipple neurotization. Neurotization of the nipple may restore sensation in NF1 patients who undergo nipple-sparing mastectomy and immediate breast reconstruction for an NAC-sparing solitary breast neurofibroma. Collaboration between surgical oncology and plastic surgery should guide surgical decision-making to optimize patient treatment and satisfaction outcomes."

    "abstract": "Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) primarily originate from the neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1)- associated and/or sporadic neurofibromas. Reports of malignant transformation from a sporadic soft tissue schwannoma are rare. In most tumors documented in this context so far, the malignant component is an epithelioid MPNST with a strong and diffuse S100 positivity. We present a patient diagnosed with a sporadic soft tissue schwannoma on core biopsy, which underwent rapid malignant transformation to a spindle cell type MPNST. Somatic tumor profiling of the excision specimen revealed <i>NF2</i> loss, <i>TP53</i>, <i>NRAS</i>, and subclonal <i>RICTOR</i> gene mutations. A retrospective immunohistochemical stain for p53 on the core biopsy demonstrated an aberrant staining pattern, indicating an early effect of <i>TP53</i> in the process of malignant transformation."

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a syndrome triggered by mutations in the NF1 gene, which alter the neurofibromin protein, a negative regulator of the RAS oncogenic pathway. Due to underreporting, the scarcity of studies on NF1 in Brazil and its importance in public health. This study aimed to assess the clinical and epidemiological characterisation of NF1 in a Reference Hospital in the country and DataSUS. The study analysed the electronic medical records of patients with NF1 and the DataSUS databases. The medical records showed a greater number of female, white and adult patients. There was a high frequency of clinical features adopted by the NIH consensus for the clinical diagnosis of the disease, such as CALMs, dermal neurofibromas and axillary/inguinal ephelides, bone and ophthalmological changes, in addition malignant and benign neoplasms and neurodevelopmental disorders. On the other hand, the data provided by DataSUS shows a disproportionate concentration of NF1 consultations between the country's regions, with a low level of diagnoses of newborn with NF1 and a NF1 mortality rate of 3.06% in the population. There is therefore a need for new public policies on access to diagnosis, treatment and information about the disease for the Brazilian population."

This retrospective study included children from the Netherlands and the United Kingdom diagnosed with a suprasellar LGG under the age of 18 between 2003 and 2023, with a minimum 1-year follow-up. Elevated IGF-1 was defined as IGF-1 standard deviation score (SDS) >+2.0 for age and biological sex, without growth hormone use. We included 235 patients with a median age at brain tumour diagnosis of 3.8 years (IQR 1.7-7.1). Elevated IGF-1 was observed in 73 patients (31.1%) at any time point. At tumour diagnosis, 15.2% of the 138 children tested showed elevated IGF-1. Elevated IGF-1 was associated with younger age at tumour diagnosis (P = .004), neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1; P = .028), and diencephalic syndrome (P = .047). In 55 of the 73 patients with elevated IGF-1 (75.3%), IGF-1 normalized spontaneously over time. Final height SDS corrected for target height SDS was not associated with having had an elevated IGF-1 (P = .113). No difference was found in the number of tumour progressions. Increased IGF-1 concentrations are commonly observed in children with suprasellar LGG, especially in younger children, those with an NF1 mutation, or during underweight. Elevation of IGF-1 can resolve over time, and the absence of an effect on final height or on tumour progressions seems reassuring."

    "abstract": "Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) is a rare and aggressive sarcoma often associated with neurofibromatosis type 1, whose clinical management remains complex and challenging. Few publications exist on pediatric MPNST, and limited data are available on the best treatment approach, in particular regarding local therapy. This retrospective analysis concerned 45 patients less than 18 years old with MPNST, treated at a referral center for pediatric sarcomas from 1983 to 2023. Patients were treated using a multimodal approach, based on the protocols adopted at the time of their diagnosis. For the series as a whole, the median event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were 16 and 26 months, respectively, and 5-year EFS and OS were 28.8% and 40.1%. The first event was local failure in 18 cases, local failure plus metastases in nine cases, and metastases-only in four cases. At univariable analysis, survival was better for males and patients younger than 15 years, and was influenced by tumor invasiveness and tumor size. With regard to treatment modalities, survival rates were significantly better for patients who responded to chemotherapy; EFS, local relapse-free survival (LRFS), and OS were better for patients who had a surgical resection; EFS and LRFS were better for patients who received radiotherapy combined with surgery, while OS was better for patients who had R0 resection. Our study confirmed the unsatisfactory outcome of MPNST pediatric patients. Our series would suggest that a combined local treatment that included both surgical resection and radiotherapy could improve local control."

    "abstract": "Cutaneous neurofibromas (cNFs) are the hallmark of the tumor-predisposition syndrome neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1). While cNFs are always benign, they markedly decrease quality of life in individuals with NF1. Understanding the differences between cNFs and the skin is essential for developing treatments for cNFs. We collected 15 cNFs from four NF1 individuals and used mass spectrometry to compare the tumor tissue with the skin overlying each tumor. Data were analyzed based on Gene Ontology (GO) terms. The expression patterns of the Schwann cell marker S100B and several keratins confirmed successful dissection of cNF tissue from the overlying skin. Hierarchical clustering showed extensive overlap between the tumor and skin samples in three out of four individuals, suggesting high overall similarity between the two tissue types. Based on the analysis of the GO terms, cNFs were associated with decreased expression of proteins related to cell proliferation, extracellular matrix remodeling, angiogenesis and cellular metabolism. The cNFs are relatively quiescent, consistent with their benign nature and limited growth potential. The development of pharmacological therapy for cNFs requires overcoming the high similarity between cNFs and the overlying skin. The present dataset can serve as a resource for future research on cNFs."

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal-dominant genetic disorder caused by pathogenic variants in the NF1 gene. Its clinical phenotype is heterogeneous and evolves across the lifespan; approximately 1 in 3,000 individuals worldwide are affected. Cardinal features comprise café-au-lait macules, axillary/inguinal freckling, cutaneous neurofibromas, plexiform neurofibromas, and optic-pathway gliomas. Advanced molecular diagnostics-including next-generation sequencing (NGS) and RNA sequencing-have markedly improved mutation detection rates and facilitate definitive diagnosis. Therapeutic progress has also accelerated: the U.S. FDA has approved the MEK inhibitors selumetinib and mirdametinib for the treatment of plexiform neurofibromas, and these agents may offer benefit for additional NF1-related manifestations. The disorder further compromises skeletal integrity, neurocognitive function, and confers an increased risk of malignancy. This review highlights the necessity for multidisciplinary care of individuals with NF1, with emphasis on early diagnosis, age-stratified health-surveillance suggestion from infancy through adulthood, cancer-prevention strategies, and comprehensive genetic counseling, all aimed at mitigating complications and enhancing quality of life."

    "abstract": "A sharply angular thoracic deformity, commonly seen in dystrophic scoliosis associated with neurofibromatosis type 1, can compress the spinal cord and potentially cause neurological impairment. However, managing paraplegia due to severe kyphoscoliosis associated with neurofibromatosis type 1, coupled with low body mass index and extremely severe kyphoscoliosis, presents a significant challenge. A 13-year-old girl of Mongolian ethnicity with severe dystrophic kyphoscoliosis associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 presented with paraplegia and dyspnea. Preoperative radiograph imaging revealed the presence of a thoracic kyphosis and scoliosis, with a Cobb angle of 150° and 130°, respectively. A two-stage strategy was devised, comprising halo-pelvic traction and spinal fusion with pedicle screws. The neurological deficit showed gradual improvement and ultimately complete recovery during the distraction phase. The curve decreased to an acceptable level, and posterior pedicle screws were implanted and fused without osteotomy. Postoperatively, the hunchback was no longer visible. There were no complications associated with halo-pelvic traction. At the 3-year follow-up, the correction angle and trunk balance were well maintained. It is possible that neurological deficit resulting from severe scoliosis may be reversed following the correction of the spinal curvature. The application of halo-pelvic traction generates substantial corrective forces, facilitating the correction of severe spinal deformities in a gradual and secure manner. A two-stage treatment strategy for patients with severe kyphoscoliosis in neurofibromatosis type 1 may offer an alternative approach to correcting the severe curve while avoiding the potential complications associated with a rapid, one-stage correction."

To compare the radiographic and clinical outcomes of dystrophic neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) kyphoscoliosis patients undergoing three-column osteotomy (3CO), halo-gravity traction (HGT), or posterior column osteotomy (PCO) and to evaluate their efficacy and safety in this cohort, different treatment strategies and their associated complication rates warrant further comprehensive investigation. Dystrophic NF1 kyphoscoliosis were divided into 3CO, HGT, and PCO groups based on the surgical strategy. Radiographic parameters were measured preoperatively, postoperatively, and at each follow-up. Intraoperative and postoperative complications were recorded for each patient, and patient-reported outcomes were assessed using the Scoliosis Research Society-22 (SRS-22) questionnaire. Differences among the three groups were analyzed. A total of 9 patients were included in the 3CO, 22 in HGT group, 95 in PCO groups, respectively. Significant differences among the three groups were found in terms of operation time (p = 0.011), estimated blood loss (p = 0.003), and number of satellite rod techniques (p = 0.013). At pre-operation, the Cobb angles of main curves were 84.3 ± 24.6° in 3CO group, 99.1 ± 24.3° in HGT group, 60.0 ± 16.8° in PCO group. At post-operation, significant post-operative improvements were found in the Cobb angles of the main curves, apical vertebral translation (AVT), segmental kyphosis (SK), and deformity angular ratio (DAR) in all three groups (p < 0.001). No significant correction loss was observed during the follow-up. Six complications were found in the 3CO group, 13 in the HGT group, and 40 in the PCO group. PCO, 3CO, and HGT could be applied to dystrophic NF1 patients. The 3CO is also associated with increased perioperative complications. IV."

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis Type 1 is a genetic disorder resulting in RAS pathway activation. As a result, risk of developing both benign and malignant neoplasms is higher, compared with the general population. Plexiform neurofibromas are benign tumors of the peripheral nerve sheath affecting 40%-50% of patients with neurofibromatosis Type 1. Cervical-parametrial plexiform neurofibroma is a very rare neoplasm. Here we present the ninth case in the literature. A 37-year-old woman presented with chronic pelvic pain and a pelvic mass that was 73 × 33 mm in size. Most of the mass was located between the proximal vagina-cervix and the bladder. It was infiltrating the bilateral parametrium and the pararectal tissues. There was hydronephrosis on the right side and her right kidney was atrophic. The tumor would likely also cause obstruction on the left side. We performed a type B radical hysterectomy, right salpingo-oophorectomy, left salpingectomy, cystoscopy, left ureterorenoscopy, and left ureteral double-j catheterization, in addition to resection of the tumor, which was located between the cervix and bladder. She was followed for 11 months without any tumor relapse. The left kidney remained normal in the follow-up period. To our knowledge, this is the first publication reporting the neurofibromatosis Type1 mutation c.7615 + 6 T>C as a pathogenic variant. In this case, we showed that plexiform neurofibromas and neurofibromatosis should be taken into account, when a pelvic mass adjacent to the uterine cervix is diagnosed, particularly if the tumor tends to accompany the peripheral nerve tracts. Surgical treatment of cervical-parametrial plexiform neurofibromas is recommended in certain circumstances and a multidisciplinary approach may help to determine the optimal management."

It can occur sporadically or as part of hereditary disorders, such as multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2) and, less commonly, neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Pheochromocytoma can cause metabolic disturbances, including impaired glucose tolerance and hyperglycemia. However, hypoglycemia is typically a postoperative complication rather than an initial presentation. We reported an unusual presentation of pheochromocytoma with persistent hypoglycemia in a patient with NF1. A 27-year-old normotensive woman with a past medical history of NF1 experienced a sudden episode of dizziness and presyncope while she was driving, causing a motor vehicle accident. She was found with persistent hypoglycemia, and her imaging revealed a right adrenal mass. The diagnosis of pheochromocytoma was confirmed through biochemical testing, which revealed significantly elevated serum metanephrines and normetanephrine levels. Our case shows that hereditary pheochromocytoma associated with NF1 can present with persistent hypoglycemia."

One case of a TDH5 combined with familiar NF1 fetus treated at Gansu Maternal and Child Health Hospital in January 2024 was selected as the research subject. The clinical and family history data of the fetus were collected by retrospective research method. 10-15 mL of fetal amniotic fluid, and 2-3 mL of peripheral blood from the parents, sister, and grandfather of the fetus were collected, and genomic DNA was extracted for trio whole-exome sequencing (trio-WES). The Sanger sequencing was utilized to validate candidate variants for family verification. According to the Standards and Guidelines for the Interpretation and Reporting of Sequence Variants of the American Society of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) (hereafter referred to as the ACMG guidelines), the pathogenicity of the detected variants was classified. This study has been approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Gansu Maternal and Child Health Hospital [Ethics No.（2021）GSFY（65）]. The fetal ultrasound indicated the nuchal translucency (NT) thickening, and the thyroid function test results of the sister showed an increase in thyroid stimulating hormone and a decrease in free thyroid hormone. Simultaneously, there were cafe-au-lait macules of various sizes in multiple parts of the body of the sister, and the mother had a similar cafe-au-lait macules phenotype. The trio-WES results revealed that there was a c.413dupA (p.Tyr138*) frameshift mutation in exon4 and c.573G>A (p.Trp191*) nonsense mutation in exon5 of the fetal DUOXA2, which were inherited from the mother and father, respectively. In accordance with the ACMG guidelines, they were classified as pathogenic variant (PVS1+PM2_Supporting+PM3) and likely pathogenic variant (PVS1+PM2_Supporting), respectively. And the nonsense mutation c.6972C>A (p.Tyr2264*) was detected in exon46 of the NF1 in the fetus, inherited from the mother maternal grandfather. The genetic testing results of the first sister and proband in this case were consistent, and the DUOXA2 and NF1 of the second sister were both wild-type. According to the ACMG guidelines, c.6972C>A (p.Tyr2264 *) was classified as pathogenic variant (PVS1+PS4_Supporting+PP4+PM2_Supporting). The mutations in the DUOXA2 gene c.413dupA (p.Tyr138*) and c.573G>A (p.Trp191*), and the NF1 gene c.6972C>A (p.Tyr2264*) might be the genetic causes of TDH5 combined with familiar NF1 in proband. The discovery of the DUOXA2 gene c.573G>A (p.Trp191*) enriches the spectrum of pathogenic gene variations."

Schlemm canal diameter (SCD), anterior chamber angle (ACA), angle opening distance (AOD500 and AOD750), trabecular-iris space area (TISA500 and TISA750) and scleral spur length (SSL) were examined in the temporal sections and measured with customized software. Also, iris thickness (IT) was measured as the distances between the anterior and posterior iris surface, at 1 mm (IT-1), 2 mm (IT-2) and 3 mm (IT-3) from the edge of the pupil. Mean ACD was significantly narrower in NF1 group (p = 0.003).

Café-au-lait macules (CALMs) are a hallmark of the disease, often representing one of the earliest clinical manifestations and allowing a clinical NF1 diagnosis if six or more are present. In this study, we aimed to investigate the prognostic value of CALMs at birth in NF1 patients. We conducted a retrospective study in patients aged ≥ 4 years presenting with CALMs at our Institution between 2020 and 2021, with a minimum follow-up of four years. We retrospectively collected data on CALMs at birth and other clinical manifestations associated with NF1. Among 208 patients evaluated, including 147 with a confirmed diagnosis of NF1, 110 did not show CALMs at birth, and 98 had at least one. The absence of CALMs at birth did not correlate with a lower likelihood of NF1. In contrast, the CALM number at birth directly correlated with the likelihood of NF1, up to 95% in patients with ≥5 macules. Additionally, a higher number of CALMs correlated with a greater prevalence of plexiform neurofibromas (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Our findings suggest that a higher number of CALMs may indicate a more severe form of NF1, with an increased risk of plexiform neurofibromas. These results emphasize the importance of a comprehensive evaluation of patients with CALMs, especially in case of multiple lesions, aiming at implementing early NF1 diagnosis, follow-up strategies, and overall patient management."

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a genetic condition that affects about 1 in 3000 individuals. Approximately 50% of individuals with NF1 have a family history of the condition. Individuals with NF1 experience variable symptoms that contribute to increased stress. This study investigated whether a family history of NF1 influences levels of stress and coping strategies in adults with NF1. Adults with NF1 who live in the United States and speak English were recruited through the Children's Tumor Foundation's (CTF) NF Registry, CTF's NF Clinic Network, and the Neurofibromatosis Network. Participants completed a survey about their personal and family history of NF1, the Perceived Stress Scale 10-Item Version (PSS-10), the Brief Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced Inventory (Brief-COPE), short response questions, and demographics. Overall, 547 of 646 responses met analysis criteria. Participants with affected parents were assigned to the inherited NF1 group (n = 222) and those with unaffected parents were assigned to the sporadic NF1 group (n = 325). No differences were found in mean PSS-10 scores between the two study groups (p = 0.568). Females had significantly higher PSS-10 scores than males (p < 0.001). After Bonferroni correction, no differences were found across Brief-COPE subscales or major coping styles between the two groups. A stagewise multivariable regression indicated that 42% of the variance in PSS-10 scores was accounted for by sex assigned at birth, age, problem-focused, and avoidant coping styles (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.42, p < 0.001). Family history did not predict PSS-10 scores alone or as an interaction variable with major coping styles. This study showed no significant differences in stress or major coping styles between adults with inherited versus sporadic NF1. However, other factors may influence the stress and coping experiences of adults with NF1. Fostering discussions about patients' stressors and coping strategies could help promote stress management."

Early detection of jaw and dental alterations, which may be linked to previously identified cephalometric features of NF1, is important for preventing occlusal defects, maintaining oral hygiene, and preserving quality of life."

    "abstract": "This case report discusses post-obstructive acute kidney injury (AKI) in a 26-year-old woman with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and uterine fibroids. The patient's AKI was diagnosed through elevated creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels and confirmed by transabdominal ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) scan, which revealed severe bilateral ureterohydronephrosis. The patient underwent fluoroscopic and sonographic bilateral nephrostomy tube placement, which significantly improved renal function. An exploratory laparotomy and superficial mass biopsy indicated a retroperitoneal tumor consisting of fibroadipose and muscular tissue with focal suppurative inflammation. The patient's renal function normalized by discharge. This case underscores the importance of early recognition, radiological evaluation, and timely intervention in managing AKI secondary to obstructive uropathy and calls for further research on optimal management strategies for AKI secondary to primary retroperitoneal masses."

    "title": "Severe cervical kyphosis in a complex child with NF1, case report and literature review.",
    "abstract": "We faced and herein report a detailed description of pre-operative assessment, management, and post-operative follow-up of a 2-year and 10-month-old girl with neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) who presented with severe, dystrophic, cervical kyphosis (170 degrees) associated with extensive pre- and para-vertebral plexiform neurofibromas, who also went under MEK inhibitors therapy. Cervical kyphosis in NF1 is particularly rare, and there is no extensive literature available on the subject in terms of clinico-radiological features, surgical approach, and outcomes. We therefore also performed a comprehensive review of the available literature on the topic. The clinical report was made through the retrospective review of all medical documents and imaging of the patient. The systematic review was performed based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria set by the authors on surgical management of cervical kyphosis in NF1 patients according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Our patient underwent a first-stage halo-gravity traction followed by a single-stage occipito-cervical posterior fusion. The six-week traction resulted in a reduction of the deformity from 170 to 90°. A further amelioration was obtained by surgery with a final 60% correction of the curvature (69° at last post-operative X-ray). No complications were observed at 1-and-a-half-year follow-up. The plexiform neurofibromas were treated with MEK inhibitors: trametinib for 1 year and 11 months until performing halo traction, and with selumetinib after surgery. We just found 19 papers suitable according to our selection criteria. Combined anterior and posterior fusion (CAP) is generally the best treatment option, although it is not always feasible. When plexiform, symptomatic, inoperable neurofibromas coexist, surgery can be preceded or followed by MEK inhibitor treatment for better control or a volumetric reduction of the tumors. The best therapeutic choice should always be the result of a multidisciplinary, expert approach and patient-tailored design."

    "title": "Surgical Outcomes of Single-Stage Correction Using Cervical Pedicle Screw Fixation Rather Than Lateral Mass Fixation in NF1-Associated Pediatric Cervical Kyphosis: A Retrospective Study with a Minimum 2-Year Follow-Up.",
    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1) can cause severe kyphosis in the cervical vertebrae. There is no consensus on the optimal surgical treatment for this rare condition, although long-segment fixation and combined approaches are generally preferred. To our knowledge, this study is the first to report the clinical outcomes of patients with NF-related cervical kyphosis who underwent stand-alone posterior pedicle fixation surgery. The outcomes of 14 patients who underwent surgery using the pedicle screw were retrospectively examined between 2015 and 2022. Only patients with at least 2 years of follow-up were included. For each patient, the following parameters were recorded and evaluated at 1 month postoperatively and at the end of the follow-up period: cervical lordosis (CL), local kyphosis angle (LKA), T1 slope, cervical sagittal vertical axis, visual analog score for neck pain, modified Japanese Orthopedic Association score, and Neck Disability Index. Complications, surgical duration, blood loss, levels of instrumentation, and length of hospital stay were also recorded. In terms of radiographic parameters, all patients achieved lordosis, with the cervical LKA improving from an average of 76.7° preoperatively to an average of 20.4° in the early postoperative period. At the 2-year follow-up, the postoperative CL significantly improved compared with preoperative values (p < 0.001) with only approximately 4° correction loss. Moreover, by the end of the follow-up, all postoperative symptoms showed improvement compared with the preoperative symptoms. The average surgical duration was 211.86 ± 49.83 min. During the follow-up, junctional kyphosis was observed in 4 patients all of whom required revision surgery. C5 palsy was detected in 3 patients. Infection-related complications occurred in 6 patients, with wound infection in only 1 patient. Cervical pedicle screw fixation is an effective treatment for NF-1-related cervical kyphosis. Although this technique is considered difficult and dangerous to apply by several spine surgeons, it exerts a positive effect on clinical improvement and provides optimal correction.

To assess the characteristics of neuropathic pain and small nerve fiber impairment in patients with NF. In this case-control study, we enrolled 51 patients who fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), NF2-related schwannomatosis (SWN-NF2), and schwannomatosis-not otherwise specified (SWN-NOS). Patients completed validated questionnaires for pain and health-related quality of life and underwent neurological examination, nerve conduction studies, nerve sonography, quantitative sensory testing (QST), distal and proximal skin-punch biopsy, and corneal confocal microscopy (CCM). Pain was reported by 28 of 51 (55%) patients with 18 of 51 (35%) suffering from neuropathic pain. Pain was chronic (≥3 months) in all patients with neuropathic pain. In 28 of 51 (55%) patients, skin biopsies revealed signs of denervation, while 7 of 51 (14%) patients exhibited ≥2 pathological small fiber tests and were classified as having small fiber impairment. Neuropathic pain and small fiber abnormalities are prevalent among patients with NF as well as SWN. Although no clear correlation between small fiber damage and painful neuropathy was found, these findings need special attention and correct categorization to offer efficient analgesic treatment."

    "abstract": "Plexiform neurofibromas (PNFs), a critical clinical feature of neurofibromatosis type 1, mainly involve several peripheral nerve branches and extend widely, including the skin and bones and the internal organs. Determining the appropriate treatment is difficult. Additionally, they possess the potential to develop into malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), which are linked to an extremely poor prognosis. Active treatment is critical in patients with symptoms or progressive tumor growth, especially in pediatric cases. Surgery remains the standard treatment for managing PNFs and MPNSTs; however, it has often demonstrated insufficient results because of its wide distribution and the frequent involvement of major organs. Selumetinib, a recently approved mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase inhibitor, is gaining traction in treating inoperable PNFs in children."

    "abstract": "This article describes the family of RAS genes, their role in encoding groups of proteins known as RAS proteins, and a group of genetic disorders known as RASopathy syndromes. RAS genetic disorders are associated with unregulated cell growth, differentiation, and irregularities in apoptosis leading to tumorigenesis. More than 30% of all human cancers are driven by mutations in RAS genes. There are a number of genetic disorders, known as RASopathies, that are considered potential cancer syndromes, as they predispose individuals to development of benign or malignant neoplasms. This article describes the genetic mutations in RAS genes that affect RAS protein production, creating cell signaling pathway abnormalities and leading to tumor formation. Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is used as an example of how a RASopathy disorder leads to multisystem disease sequelae. Finally, the role of MEK inhibitors in disrupting abnormal cell signaling is described in their use with NF1 plexiform neurofibromas and their emerging roles in cancer treatment."

    "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> Cerebral pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma (PXA) in patients with Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) is truly a rare entity. Intraventricular anaplastic PXA (APXA) is an even more uncommon presentation, with only three cases reported in the literature. <b>Case Description:</b> We present the case of a 30-year-old female with known NF1 who developed an intraventricular WHO Grade 3 PXA. The tumor was initially resected but recurred aggressively, requiring further surgery and adjuvant therapy with radiation, lomustine, and bevacizumab. Despite treatment, the tumor continued to progress, and the patient's clinical course deteriorated. <b>Discussion:</b> Distinguishing Grade 3 PXA from epithelioid glioblastoma can be diagnostically challenging and often requires further molecular testing. Aggressive multimodal therapy including maximal safe resection, radiation, and chemotherapy may be warranted, but outcomes remain poor. The challenging location of this patient's tumor in the ventricular system added to the complexity of overall treatment. Furthermore, the association of WHO Grade 3 PXA with NF1 is exceedingly rare, and the optimal management and prognosis of this rare tumor in the setting of NF1 are not well established. <b>Conclusions:</b> This case report highlights the unique challenges in diagnosing and managing intraventricular WHO Grade 3 PXA, particularly in the context of NF1. Additional research is necessary to enhance the understanding and effective management of these rare and aggressive tumors."

This investigator-initiated, phase II, multicenter, single-arm trial enrolled patients with unresectable MPNSTs. Patients were treated with pexidartinib 1000 mg and sirolimus 2 mg orally daily. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary end points included objective response, safety profile, and overall survival (OS). Pretreatment and on-treatment tumor biopsies were obtained to evaluate changes in the tumor microenvironment (TME) using multiplex immunofluorescence and differential transcriptional profiling. Fifteen patients with MPNSTs were enrolled and 14 initiated therapy. Eight had neurofibromatosis type 1, five were sporadic, and one was undetermined. Although the target sample size was 25, because of the lower-than-expected accrual during the COVID-19 pandemic, enrollment was halted on April 12, 2023. The median PFS and median OS were 6 weeks (95% CI, 6 to 19.1) and 17.9 weeks (95% CI, 13.7 to not applicable), respectively. One patient achieved confirmed stable disease. Three patients experienced PFS ≥12 weeks. Grade 3 treatment-related toxicities (rash and leukopenia) occurred in four (28.6%) patients. Although the study did not meet its primary end point, correlative analysis demonstrated that four of the five long-term survivors had an immune-rich pretreatment TME, three of whom had a reduction in M2-tumor-associated macrophage signal with treatment. Further studies of combination of pexidartinib and sirolimus and/or immunotherapy should be performed in the subset of patients with advanced MPNST with an immune-rich TME."

    "abstract": "Orbital neurofibromas are benign tumors originating from the peripheral nerve sheath, often linked to neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1) [1], although they account for less than 1% of all orbital tumors [2, 3]. These tumors can cause symptoms such as proptosis, vision impairment, and ocular misalignment [4]. While typically linked to NF-1, multiple isolated orbital neurofibromas in the absence of a definitive NF-1 diagnosis remain exceedingly rare, warranting clinical attention. A 56-year-old female presented with ptosis and dystopia on the right side. MRI revealed multiple intraorbital and extraconal masses, with the largest being excised via anterior orbitotomy. Histopathological analysis confirmed the diagnosis of neurofibroma. The patient had no cutaneous or systemic signs suggestive of NF-1. In adults, multiple orbital tumors should prompt suspicion for neurofibromas, even when NF-1 is not confirmed. Furthermore, recurrence is possible, emphasizing the importance of long-term follow-up. This case highlights the diagnostic challenge posed by orbital neurofibromas without NF-1 and the need for comprehensive systemic evaluation in such presentations."

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant hereditary tumor-predisposition syndrome and a genetic bone disease. The case report describes tumor-associated mandibular changes, their therapy and follow-up over several decades. The aim of the presentation is to highlight the tumorous and hamartomatous components of the facial skeleton and to examine the stability of surgical measures over the long term. A 13-year-old male patient had developed an extensive diffuse plexiform neurofibroma of the left cheek and neck region. Radiological examination showed a mandibular defect, which enlarged over time. Surgical treatment consisted of a corrective procedure for the asymmetrical bony chin and augmentation osteoplasty of mandibular defect. The transplant was an integral part of a functionally stable bone for decades. Head and neck diffuse plexiform neurofibroma can be associated with craniofacial bone malformations. Distinction between deformity-related bone changes from an infiltrating and destructive tumor can be difficult, especially in cases of rapidly progressive local bone loss. Presumably, both tumor-associated functional lesions of the masticatory muscles and tumor-related effects on the bone influence the shape of the affected bone. Diagnosis of tumor-associated bone lesions can be challenging in NF1. Reconstructive bone surgery of the jaw provides options for functional and esthetic improvement of the affected individual. However, long-term follow-up checks are advisable to assess treatment results. An exact assessment of the tumor type and long-term monitoring of the findings are the basis of a viable surgical therapy."

    "abstract": "A malignant Triton tumor (MTT) is a rare and aggressive soft tissue sarcoma associated with poor prognosis and with no established treatment protocol. A 38-year-old man presented with severe right thigh pain and limited hip motion. Since childhood, the patient had a mass on their thigh, accompanied by café-au-lait spots. Upon admission, a biopsy confirmed MTT that had metastasized to the lungs. Preoperative radiation therapy was administered to reduce the tumor size; however, the tumor did not shrink. Extensive resection was not feasible because of the tumor size and location, prompting a decision to perform volume reduction surgery aimed at alleviating the patient's pain and improving mobility. Although the surgery provided temporary relief from the symptoms, the patient died two weeks later. MTT requires a multidisciplinary approach that includes surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy; however, in advanced cases such as this one, palliative measures may be more appropriate. This case underscores the challenges in managing MTT and highlights the potential role of volume reduction surgery in improving the quality of life of patients with significant symptoms. Despite the poor prognosis, symptom palliation during the two weeks leading up to the patient's death was significant, illustrating the importance of addressing pain and mobility issues while considering overall treatment strategies in such complex cases. These findings emphasize the need for further research on effective management options for MTT to improve patient outcomes."

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a tumor predisposition syndrome and a bone disease. Dystrophic facial skull often is topographically related to diffuse neurofibromas (DNFs). The report traces the diagnosis and treatment of an oral DNF that was registered in adolescence and describes associated bone findings. The aim of the investigation was to illustrate and specify the interplay of tumor-associated and dysmorphic changes of the facial skull in NF1. This 14-year-old patient with NF1 had developed a solid tumor arising from the mandibular anterior lingual alveolar process. Histological examination of the tumor identified a DNF. Imaging showed a funnel-shaped vertical defect of the alveolar process between incisors, asymmetry of bony chin and vertical position of mental foramina. The chin showed irregular, bi-cortical connected bone canals suspected to indicate enlarged neurovascular channels. Thirteen years later, the patient developed a local tumor recurrence (DNF). Meanwhile, the anterior bone defect had become larger. However, the bony chin appeared considerably sclerosed. In contrast, mandibular shape and surface were unchanged. DNF can affect the position of teeth, invade the bone, and cause enlarged bone channels. Surface erosion and trophic effects of the mandible may arise adjacent to the neurogenic lesion. DNF of the oral cavity can recur. It is becoming apparent that the tumor-associated skeletal and dental changes in the mandible correlate with the time of development of the peripheral nerve sheath tumor. The findings could be useful as indications for an expanded tumor search in the affected area."

    "abstract": "Congenital pseudarthrosis of the tibia (CPT) is one of the most challenging conditions in orthopedics. Previous research indicates a strong association between CPT and neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). The clinical application of pamidronate has demonstrated efficacy in enhancing bone healing and alleviating NF1-associated bone pathology in specific CPT cases. Nevertheless, the precise mechanistic basis for these therapeutic effects remains poorly characterized, warranting further investigation. In this study, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were isolated from patients with congenital pseudarthrosis of the tibia (CPT MSCs) and from patients undergoing corrective osteotomy (control group). We examined cell conditions post-treatment with pamidronate disodium at concentrations of 0 nM, 10 nM, 100 nM, and 1 μM, evaluating proliferation, toxicity, and differentiation potential, while investigating its effects on the OPG/RANKL pathway. Additionally, we analyzed the alterations in mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling and its correlation with the regulatory expression of OPG/RANKL genes. This study demonstrated that the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of CPT MSCs were significantly lower than those of the control group. Treatment with pamidronate disodium enhanced both proliferation and osteogenic differentiation in CPT MSCs. Furthermore, pamidronate disodium treatment decreased RANKL expression and increased OPG protein levels in CPT MSCs, activating p38 and ERK1/2 signaling pathways. Notably, the co-administration of p38 or ERK1/2 inhibitors significantly diminished the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of CPT MSCs treated with pamidronate disodium. Pamiphosphonate disodium can promote the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of CPT MSCs by activating p38 and ERK1/2 signaling."

    "abstract": "Evidence suggests a pathological role of myelination in neurodevelopmental disorders with links to cognitive difficulties, but in vivo assessment remains challenging. Quantitative T1 mapping (QT1) has been used in prior clinical studies (e.g., of multiple sclerosis) and shows promise for reliable measurement of myelin alterations. We investigated QT1 for measuring myelination in children with neurodevelopmental disorders of the RAS-MAPK signaling pathway (RASopathies). We collected QT1, diffusion-weighted, and structural MRI scans from 72 children (49 RASopathies, 23 typical developing (TD)). QT1 myelin content measures included white matter macromolecular tissue volume (MTV) and cortical R1 (1/T1 relaxation). Group differences were assessed across 39 white matter tracts. Principal components analysis captured cortical myelination patterns across 360 regions, followed by a MANOVA. A support vector machine (SVM) identified the most discriminative features between-groups. Thirty-four of 39 tracts were higher in MTV in RASopathies relative to TD (p<sub>FDR</sub><.05), indicating widespread elevation in myelination. MANOVA revealed a group effect on cortical R1 (p=.002, η<sup>2</sup>=.028), suggesting cortical myelination differences between-groups. The SVM yielded an accuracy of 87% and identified cognitive and cortical R1 features as the most discriminant between-groups. We found widespread elevated white matter tract myelin and region-dependent cortical myelination patterns in children with RASopathies. Leveraging preclinical models showing oligodendrocyte dysfunction, QT1 revealed precocious myelination. Further work is needed to explore relationships with cognition. QT1 is a promising tool for identification and monitoring of myelin as a treatment target in neurodevelopmental disorders, offering significant potential for advancing current therapeutic strategies."

This study outlines the establishment of an international neuro-oncology tumor board to address these gaps. The tumor board was initiated in January 2021 through a partnership between Washington University in St. Louis, USA, and nine institutions, ultimately expanding to 39 institutions across 25 countries. Monthly virtual meetings facilitated multidisciplinary case reviews offering diagnostic and management recommendations. A retrospective analysis of 29 sessions over three years was conducted, and a cross-sectional web-based survey among participants assessed their experiences and satisfaction. From January 2021 to December 2023, 101 cases were reviewed. The most diagnoses were low-grade gliomas (23.4%) and neurofibromatosis type 1 and 2 (32.7%). Newly diagnosed cases comprised 51%, while 40% involved recurrent or progressive disease, and 9% were inquiries during ongoing therapy. Recommendations predominantly addressed therapeutic strategies (60.7%). Advanced diagnostics, such as methylation profiling, refined diagnoses in several cases. The survey, with a 35% response rate, showed high satisfaction, with 91% finding the meetings educational. Barriers included time constraints (71%) and conflicting commitments (27%). This initiative, to our knowledge, represents the largest international pediatric neuro-oncology tumor board.

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a genetic disease that follows an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, characterized by significant phenotypic variability and unpredictable clinical progression. Affected individuals can present from mild cosmetic involvement with café-au-lait macules to benign and malignant neoplasms, among other comorbidities that can diminish well-being or pose a threat to it. The transmission risk is 50%, and it is impossible to predict the extent of manifestations in the offspring. This qualitative study explored emotional and psychological meanings attributed by individuals with NF1 to their experience, based on Mishel's Uncertainty in Illness Theory. Thirty-eight Brazilian adults with NF1 responded to a self-reported online questionnaire. In it, sociodemographic information was collected, an NF1 visibility assessment scale and the Brazilian version of the NF1 Impact on Quality of Life (INF1-QoL) questionnaire were administered. Finally, three open-ended questions were asked about the impact of the disease on individuals' lives: the first regarding the influence of NF1 on the participant's life in general, the second about NF1 in different life stages, and the third about their experience of health monitoring. Qualitative content analysis was used to investigate the corpus. Fifteen main categories were identified, which align with Mishel's theory and contribute to comprehending uncertainty in NF1, manifested primarily regarding the disease progression in the individual, reproductive planning, and distress about the future of already affected children. This deeper understanding of the NF1 experience and associated uncertainty can enhance the cultural competence of genetic counselors and contribute to more effective clinical approaches and interventions."

    "abstract": "Pain is a common symptom in individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) that often is associated with plexiform neurofibroma (pNF) tumors. To date, no patient-reported outcome measures have been validated specifically to assess pNF-related pain intensity or pain interference in this population. Such measures are sorely needed since pain is being considered as an outcome in clinical trials targeting reduction of pNF. The study aims were to: (1) obtain qualitative information from individuals with NF1 and pNFs about their pain and its measurement and (2) modify existing scales to assess pNF-related pain intensity and pain interference for NF1 clinical trials. For this multi-site, qualitative study, 56 individuals (26 children, 6-16 years; 30 adults, 18-68 years) with NF1 and pNF participated in a focus group and/or individual interview about pain intensity and pain interference (concept elicitation) and also provided feedback about existing pain measures (Numeric Rating Scale-11 and Pain Interference Index) assessing these domains (cognitive debriefing). Four additional waves of cognitive debriefing interviews further refined the measures. Qualitative concept elicitation data from transcripts were coded, analyzed using NVivo software, and thematic analysis was conducted using both deductive and inductive techniques. Additional themes and systematic problems and suggestions regarding the measures were gleaned from reviewing the field notes and interview transcriptions generated by the cognitive debriefing sessions. Concept elicitation themes included descriptions of two types of pNF-related pain (chronic and episodic), variability of pain over time, varying ability to recall pain, lack of knowledge of pNFs, and the ways pain interferes with daily activities. Cognitive debriefing themes included information on how to rate pNF-related pain intensity apart from other pain; problems and suggestions regarding the measures included difficulty comprehending some items and preferences for alternative wording and formatting. Based on these qualitative results, the measures' instructions, items, and formatting were modified to create the PAin INtensity Scale for plexiform neurofibromas (PAINS-pNF) and the Pain Interference Index for plexiform neurofibromas (PII-pNF) for administration on a mobile app or web-based platform. The PAINS-pNF and PII-pNF are promising self-report measures developed using patient engagement to evaluate tumor pain intensity and pain interference in NF1 clinical trials. The second phase of the study to provide reliability, validity, and normative data for individuals with NF1 and pNFs ages 8 years and older is underway."

    "abstract": "Renal artery stenosis due to neurofibromatosis type 1 is a known important source of secondary renovascular hypertension in pediatric patients. There are no guidelines on the management of renal artery stenosis in children, and the utility of stents and bypass grafting is limited given small patient size. Renal autotransplant to treat renal artery stenosis in a small pediatric patient may be a viable alternative for treatment and spare the need for nephrectomy. In this article, we present a case of renal autotransplant in a 6-year-old, 15.8 kg Nepali patient with neurofibromatosis type 1 with refractory hypertension and high-grade stenosis of the proximal right main renal artery. The patient underwent balloon angioplasty, which failed to dilate the stenosis. He later developed hypertensive urgency and required admission to the pediatric intensive care unit. The patient was not a candidate for repeat angioplasty given the length of the stenotic segment and its tortuosity. Blood pressure was unable to be controlled on multiple antihypertensive agents and the patient eventually developed hypertensive urgency. Therefore, a renal autotransplant of the right kidney was performed after multidisciplinary evaluation. The right renal artery ostium had significant hypertrophied intima involving 50% of its circumference. The kidney was procured in the same fashion as a living kidney donor nephrectomy. The kidney was mobilized in situ, and heparin was administered. The renal artery and renal vein were divided with surgical staplers. The kidney was removed from the patient and moved to the back table. On the back table, the organ was flushed with cold organ preservation solution and vessels inspected. The diseased portion of the right renal artery was resected to the location of no gross intimal thickening. It was judged that there was adequate length of the healthy artery remaining to allow safe reimplantation. The renal artery and vein were reimplanted to the abdominal aorta and inferior vena cava, respectively. The patient tolerated the surgery well, and 2 years postoperatively, he only requires one antihypertensive medication. Nephrectomy may be favored over renal autotransplant in small pediatric patients due to technical difficulties associated with autotransplant. We demonstrate significant clinical improvement in blood pressure control in a 15.8 kg, 6-year-old pediatric patient after renal autotransplant."

    "title": "Renal artery rupture with lethal outcome in a patient with neurofibromatosis type 1: Case report and review of literature.",
    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 is an autosomal dominant disorder. The vasculopathy of neurofibromatosis type 1 may rarely comprise stenosis, occlusion, aneurysm, pseudoaneurysm, and arteriovenous deformity, and it often presents as rupture of an undiagnosed lesion, which highly increases mortality in young patients with neurofibromatosis type 1. A female patient in her early 30s who had neurofibromatosis type 1 presented to our hospital with extensive and progressive bleeding of a ruptured renal artery pseudoaneurysm caused by trauma. Complete total embolization of the renal artery was performed using several microcoils and a mixture of n-butyl cyanoacrylate and iodized oil. Despite combined endovascular and surgical management tailored to the patient's condition, she died from uncontrolled bleeding. Endovascular treatment is widely regarded as a safe and less invasive option for managing vascular complications in neurofibromatosis type 1. However, it may be insufficient in rapidly progressive cases. Considering the vascular fragility and recurrence of hemorrhagic shock, earlier surgical intervention, including nephrectomy, should have been more strongly considered. This case highlights the limitations of repeated endovascular management alone and suggests that prompt surgical exploration is warranted when pseudoaneurysm rupture is suspected, even in seemingly stable patients. Ultimately, this case underscores the need for heightened clinical vigilance and early surgical decision-making in the treatment of neurofibromatosis type 1 and rapidly evolving vascular injuries."

    "title": "Sleep Disorders in Pediatric Patients Affected by Neurofibromatosis Type 1: Reports of a Questionnaire and an Apple Watch Sleep Assessment.",
    "abstract": "<b>Introduction:</b> Sleep is a fundamental biological function critical for physical and mental health. Chronic sleep disturbances can significantly impair cognitive, emotional, and social functioning, leading to deficits in attention, alertness, and executive function, alongside increased irritability, anxiety, and depression. For pediatric patients, such disturbances pose additional concerns, potentially disrupting developmental processes and quality of life for both children and their families. <b>Objectives:</b> Emerging evidence suggests a correlation between neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and an increased prevalence of sleep disorders in children. NF1, a genetic condition affecting multiple body systems, including the nervous system, may predispose children to sleep disturbances due to its neurodevelopmental and behavioral impacts. This observational case-control study aimed to explore the association between NF1 and sleep disorders in pediatric patients, comparing the prevalence and patterns of sleep disturbances between NF1 patients and healthy controls. <b>Patients and Methods:</b> The study included 100 children aged 2-12 years, divided into two groups: 50 with NF1 (case group) and 50 children belonging to the control group. NF1 patients were recruited from the Unit of Rare Diseases of the Nervous System in Childhood at the Policlinico \"G. Rodolico-San Marco\" University Hospital in Catania. Data were collected using a questionnaire completed by parents, assessing parasomnias, breathing-related sleep disorders, and other behavioral and physiological disturbances; these data were compared to a sleep assessment performed using an Apple Watch Ultra. <b>Results</b>: NF1 patients exhibited a significantly higher prevalence of sleep disorders than controls. Notable differences included increased nocturnal hyperhidrosis (48% vs. 10%), bruxism (48% vs. 28%), restless legs syndrome (22% vs. 4%), frequent nighttime awakenings (22% vs. 8%), and sleep paralysis (12% vs. 0%). A finding of poorer sleep quality also emerged from the results of sleep analysis using an Apple Watch Ultra. <b>Conclusions:</b> These findings confirm an elevated risk of sleep disorders in children with NF1, emphasizing the importance of early identification and management to improve quality of life and mitigate cognitive and behavioral impacts. Further research is essential to understand the mechanisms underlying these associations and develop targeted interventions for this population."

    "abstract": "Sifrim-Hitz-Weiss syndrome (SIHIWES) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by neurodevelopmental delay and variable congenital defects, including cardiac and skeletal, caused by mutations in the CHD4 gene. Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a well-known disease characterized by cafe-au-lait spots and fibromatous tumors of the skin caused by heterozygous mutations in the NF1 gene. We report a male patient, 6 months old at the time of the first examination and 4.5 years old at the time of the second examination, with dysmorphic facial features, multiple café-au-lait spots, bilateral postaxial polydactyly, hydrocephalus, and dextrocardia. Whole exome sequencing revealed a de novo heterozygous c.4256G>A (p.Arg1419His) variant in the CHD4 and a heterozygous c.1411A>T (p.Lys471Ter) variant in the NF1 gene, compatible with the dual diagnosis of NF1 and SIHIWES. Although congenital heart anomalies have been reported as a component of SIHIWES, dextrocardia is a novel finding that has not previously been reported in this syndrome. Adding dextrocardia to the previously described findings, including polydactyly and hydrocephalus, suggests that a gene related to ciliary function may be a downstream target of CHD4."

    "title": "High-content microscopy and machine learning characterize a cell morphology signature of <i>NF1</i> genotype in Schwann cells.",
    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a multi-system, autosomal dominant genetic disorder driven by the systemic loss of the NF1 protein neurofibromin. Loss of neurofibromin in Schwann cells is particularly detrimental, as the acquisition of a 'second-hit' (e.g., complete loss of <i>NF1</i> ) can lead to the development of plexiform neurofibromas (pNF). pNFs are painful, disfiguring tumors with an approximately 1 in 5 chance of sarcoma transition. Selumetinib and mirdametinib are currently the only medicines approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of pNFs. This motivates the need to develop new therapies, either derived to treat <i>NF1</i> haploinsufficiency or complete loss of <i>NF1</i> function. To identify new therapies, we need to understand the impact neurofibromin has on Schwann cells. Here, we aimed to characterize differences in high-content microscopy in neurofibromin-deficient Schwann cells. We applied a fluorescence microscopy assay (called Cell Painting) to an isogenic pair of Schwann cell lines (derived from ipn02.3 2λ), one of wildtype genotype ( <i>NF1</i> <sup><i>+/+</i></sup> ) and one of <i>NF1</i> null genotype ( <i>NF1</i> <sup><i>-/-</i></sup> ). We modified the canonical Cell Painting assay to mark four organelles/subcellular compartments: nuclei, endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, and F-actin. We utilized CellProfiler to perform quality control, illumination correction, segmentation, and cell morphology feature extraction. We segmented 20,680 <i>NF1</i> wildtype and null cells, measured 894 significant cell morphology features representing various organelle shapes and intensity patterns, and trained a logistic regression machine learning model to predict the <i>NF1</i> genotype of single Schwann cells. The machine learning model had high performance, with training and testing data yielding a balanced accuracy of 0.85 and 0.80, respectively. However, when applied to a new pair of Schwann cells, the model's balanced accuracy dropped to 0.5, which is no better than random chance. This performance decline appears to result from morphology differences introduced by non-biological factors (cloning procedures, origin of parental cell line, and CRISPR procedures) of the second cell line pair. We plan to improve upon this preliminary model by refining the <i>NF1</i> morphology signature using a broader panel of Schwann cell lines. Our goal is to apply this enhanced signature in large-scale drug screens of <i>NF1</i> -deficient cells to identify candidate therapeutic agents that specifically reverse the disease-associated morphology. Ultimately, we aim to identify agents that restore NF1 patient-derived Schwann cells to a phenotype resembling the <i>NF1</i> wild-type and healthier state."

    "abstract": "<b>Introduction:</b> Small cell lung carcinomas (SCLC) are characterized by loss of function mutations in genes encoding for p53 (tumor protein p53-<i>TP53</i>) and retinoblastoma transcriptional corepressor 1 (<i>RB1</i>) proteins in the majority of tumors. They are aggressive, usually present with metastatic disease, and are treated with platinum-based chemotherapy with overall poor outcomes. Epidermal growth factor receptor (<i>EGFR)</i> mutations, classically associated with primary lung adenocarcinomas, have been reported in rare <i>de novo</i> SCLC outside the context of the relatively more common <i>transformed</i> SCLC that arise with emergence of tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance in <i>EGFR</i>-mutant adenocarcinomas. <b>Aim:</b> To analyze the clinicopathological features of <i>EGFR</i>-mutant <i>de novo</i> SCLC. <b>Methods:</b> <i>EGFR</i>-mutant <i>de novo</i> SCLCs were retrieved over 5 years and reviewed for clinicopathological parameters. <b>Results:</b> Five patients were identified harboring either exon 19 deletion (n = 4) or exon 21 L858R mutation (n = 1) in <i>EGFR</i>. Median age at diagnosis was 48 years (30-58 years). Four patients were never-smokers of whom three were tobacco chewers. Three biopsies showed pure small cell carcinoma while others showed composite adenocarcinoma. Diffuse loss of RB1 (5/5) and mutant type p53 staining pattern (3/3) were noted in all tested samples. Among two patient samples subjected to sequencing, additional pathogenic mutations in <i>TP53</i> (2/2), <i>RB1</i> (1/2), <i>PTEN</i> (1/2), neurofibromatosis type 1 (1/2), and <i>CREBB1</i> (1/2) were identified. <b>Conclusion:</b> <i>EGFR-</i>mutant <i>de novo</i> SCLCs are extremely rare and show frequent inactivation of p53 and RB1, like the more common <i>transformed</i> SCLCs. Given the lack of tyrosine kinase inhibitor exposure, these tumors highlight the inherent lineage plasticity of <i>EGFR/TP53/RB1</i> triple mutant lung carcinomas."

This study aims to better define the clinical and molecular features of NF-NS and compare them with existing literature. Secondary objectives include evaluating inter-rater diagnostic agreement among experienced clinicians and assessing the utility of deep-learning algorithms (Face2Gene<sup>®</sup> [F2G]). Additionally, we assess the prevalence of congenital heart malformations (CHM) in NF-NS compared to 'classic' neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). A 9-year, prospective, monocentric study was conducted, involving patients with NF1 pathogenic variants (PVs) and Noonan syndrome-like facial phenotype (NSLFP). Twenty-six patients were enrolled. NSLFP was categorized as 'suggestive' in 69% of cases and 'typical' in 31%. The presence of at least two facial abnormalities (e.g., low-set ears, downslanted palpebral fissures, hypertelorism, and ptosis) was consistently observed in 'typical' cases. Inter-rater concordance was substantial (0.65 [95% CI = 0.56; 0.74]), while concordance between clinicians and F2G was almost perfect at (0.821 [CI 95% = 0.625; 1.000]). Missense NF1 PVs were observed in 38.5% of cases. Apart from NSLP and a high frequency of pectus excavatum (62.5%), no significant differences in anthropometric, dermatological, neurological, skeletal, or ocular clinical features were observed between NF-NS and 'classic' NF1. CHM were found in 19.2% of NF-NS patients, with pulmonic stenosis present in 7.7%. NF-NS is a distinct phenotypic variant of NF1, marked by NSLP with consistent facial features -, and frequent pectus excavatum. F2G demonstrated high diagnostic concordance, reinforcing its clinical utility. Given the elevated risk of CHM, especially pulmonic stenosis, proactive cardiovascular assessment similar to other RASopathies is recommended for NS-NF patients, regardless of NF1 PV type."

This case report and literature review describes our experience of using a pedicled vascularized common peroneal nerve graft to repair a 14-cm sciatic nerve defect, involving L4, L5, and S1 nerve roots. Additionally, we conducted a literature review of various types of nerve autografts for large sciatic nerve defects, summarizing their characteristics and outcomes to aid clinicians in decision-making and expected results in different scenarios. The patient, a 23-year-old female diagnosed with neurofibromatosis type I, underwent R0 tumor resection of the proximal left sciatic nerve due to a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor. She received an ipsilateral pedicled vascularized common peroneal nerve graft. The reconstruction included the L4, L5, and S1 nerve roots beyond the greater sciatic foramen into the inner pelvis. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful. At the 26-month follow-up, she showed MRC grade 4/5 strength in hamstrings with 90°knee flexion and a steady gait pattern. At the 32-month follow-up, she could ambulate very well with an ankle-foot orthosis. The outcomes support the use of a pedicled vascularized common peroneal nerve graft in a single-staged surgery to restore motor function for large sciatic nerve defects. Our literature review revealed that in cases where sural nerves are insufficient or injured for sciatic nerve reconstruction, the common peroneal nerve is a viable alternative to help patients regain functional independence."

    "abstract": "Persons with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) exhibit enhanced glucose metabolism, which is replicated in Nf1-mutant mice. Inflammatory macrophages invest NF1-associated tumors, and targeting macrophages appears efficacious in NF1 models. Inflammatory macrophages rely on glycolysis to generate ATP; thus, identifying whether neurofibromin, the protein encoded by NF1, controls glucose metabolism in macrophages is therapeutically compelling. Using neurofibromin-deficient macrophages and macrophage-specific Nf1-knockout mice, we demonstrate that neurofibromin complexes with glucose transporter-1 (GLUT1) to restrain its activity and that loss of neurofibromin permits Akt2 to facilitate GLUT1 translocation to the membrane. In turn, glucose internalization and glycolysis are upregulated and provoke reparative (M<sup>IL4</sup>) macrophages to undergo an inflammatory phenotypic switch. Inflammatory M<sup>LPSIFNγ</sup> macrophages and inflammatory-like M<sup>IL4</sup> macrophages invest the perivascular stroma of tumors and induce pathologic angiogenesis in macrophage-specific Nf1-knockout mice. These studies identify a mechanism for the enhanced glycolysis associated with NF1 and provide a novel therapeutic target for NF1."

In this retrospective cohort study, we used diffusion MRI tractography to examine the microstructure of major white matter pathways in 20 children with NF1 (ages 1-18 years) compared to 20 age- and sex-matched controls. An automated approach was used to identify and extract mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) of eight cerebral white matter pathways bilaterally and the anterior and posterior part of the corpus callosum. Compared to controls, children with NF1 had significantly increased MD and significantly decreased FA in multiple white matter pathways including the anterior thalamic radiation, cingulate, uncinate fasciculus, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, arcuate fasciculus, and corticospinal tract. Differences in MD and FA remained significant after controlling for intracranial volume. In addition, MD and FA differences between children with NF1 and controls were greater at younger than older ages.

Additionally, it compared these findings with parent and teacher evaluations from the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF) and examined the role of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Sixty-four children with NF1, aged 7-16 years (M = 10.20, SD = 2.11), were recruited from a university hospital's NF1 referral center between May 2013 and March 2016. The children completed the CEF-B, with results compared to normative data via t tests. Parents and teachers provided BRIEF assessments. Significant EF deficits were observed across all CEF-B components, and both parents and teachers reported substantial EF difficulties. Cohen's kappa indicated mild to moderate agreement between CEF-B and BRIEF scores (κ = -0.11-0.63). ADHD did not affect CEF-B performance, but children with ADHD were rated as having greater difficulties on the BRIEF than those without ADHD. NF1 significantly impairs EF across all domains in children, with most showing multiple concurrent EF impairments. These deficits appear to be partially independent of ADHD comorbidity. The CEF-B showed greater sensitivity than questionnaires in detecting EF deficits in NF1, but both performance-based assessments and real-world evaluations are necessary for a comprehensive understanding of these impairments.

We sought to assess U.S. patients' access to specialized NF1 clinics and receipt of evidence-informed health surveillance. An online survey was distributed to NF Registry participants in May 2021. Rate of NF1 clinic attendance and self-reported receipt of health surveillance amongst NF Registry participants was estimated using inverse propensity scores. Differences in these outcomes based on participant demographics were assessed using weighted logistic regression and robust linear regression, respectively. 322 individuals responded (160 adults, 162 parents; 4.7% overall response rate). We estimate that 51.7% of children and 35.6% of adults attend NF1 clinics. Younger children were more likely to attend an NF1 clinic, as were adults living in urban areas, with a college degree or higher, or with a household income ≥ $130,000 (all ps < 0.05). Completion rates for each individual health surveillance evaluation ranged from 41 to 79% for children and 33-61% for adults. Higher rates of recommended evaluations were reported by both adults and children who attend a specialized NF1 clinic, non-Hispanic White adults, and adults with commercial or Medicare insurance (all ps < 0.05). Adults with NF1 experience significant sociodemographic disparities in care, and patients of all ages attending NF1 specialty clinics receive more recommended health surveillance. Given the limited access to specialty NF clinics, quality improvement efforts are needed to increase access for underserved adults and improve provision of recommended health surveillance outside specialty clinics."

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in the NF1 gene. The most important signs are café-au-lait spots, intertriginous freckling, and neurofibromas. The disease has a progressive course, the penetrance is almost complete, and reduces life expectancy by approximately 15%. This review examines the current literature, including NIH (National Institute of Health) diagnostic criteria, genetic testing, genotype-phenotype correlations, and emerging therapies. Genetic testing has improved diagnostic accuracy, particularly for age-dependent clinical features. The genotype-phenotype correlation in NF1 underscores that specific genetic alterations, such as large deletions in the NF1 gene, are frequently linked to more severe clinical outcomes. These deletions often result in early onset of symptoms, a higher frequency of tumor development, and increased tumor burden, all of which contribute to a more complex clinical course. Consequently, individuals with these genetic changes require intensive and continuous monitoring to manage potential complications and prevent further health deterioration. Advances in therapies such as MEK inhibitors offer hope for inoperable plexiform neurofibromas, while surgery remains the primary option for localized tumors, despite the risk of recurrence. Multidisciplinary care and genetic advancements are crucial for improving the prognosis and quality of life of patients with NF1."

    "title": "Lifelong Management of Neurofibromatosis 1 Patients.",
    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a prevalent genetic disorder characterized by a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations, including cutaneous, neurological, and oncological complications. The disease results from mutations in the NF1 gene, which encodes neurofibromin, a tumor suppressor that regulates the RAS/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. The loss of neurofibromin function predisposes individuals to both benign and malignant neoplasms, including malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, optic pathway gliomas, and gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Additionally, women with NF1 are at a significantly increased risk of developing breast cancer at a younger age, necessitating enhanced surveillance measures. Beyond oncological risks, NF1 is frequently associated with cognitive and behavioral impairments, including learning disabilities, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and social communication difficulties, which significantly impact academic, occupational, and social outcomes. Moreover, systemic complications such as skeletal deformities, cardiovascular abnormalities, and chronic pain further contribute to the disease burden. Given the progressive and lifelong nature of NF1, comprehensive care strategies incorporating multidisciplinary management, early detection, and targeted interventions are essential to optimizing patient outcomes. This review highlights the importance of an integrative, lifelong management approach that addresses both the medical and psychosocial aspects of NF1. By implementing tailored surveillance programs and evidence-based interventions, healthcare providers can improve quality of life and reduce morbidity and mortality associated with this complex disorder."

    "abstract": "We report a female patient with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) who developed anorexia nervosa (AN) in her early 30s. This required several admissions for weight restoration. The patient's body image concerns and experience of stigma related to the dermatological manifestations of NF1 and her misconceptions regarding the relationship between weight and NF1 appeared to be aetiological factors for AN development. This view influenced the psychotherapeutic approach she received for AN, which was successful (current body mass index =20.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). After being diagnosed with AN, she was diagnosed with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and successfully treated with stimulant medication (dexamphetamine) without compromising her body weight. In summary, the case illustrates that NF1 may be a risk factor for AN development and that recovery from AN is possible while treating comorbid ADHD with stimulant medications."

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1) is also known as von Recklinghausen disease. It is a rare autosomal dominant disorder that affects the skin and nervous system. The head and neck region is one of the potential areas for the involvement of neurofibromatosis due to the unique anatomical compartmentalization of the central and peripheral nervous systems. Neurofibromas in the head and neck region are primarily found within the soft tissues. NF-1 can be diagnosed during childhood because characteristic cutaneous manifestations are typically present during childhood. In this report, we discuss a case involving a 30-year-old woman diagnosed with NF-1. She presented with right neck swelling preceded by a history of neck trauma. She had a history of numerous café-au-lait spots in the thorax, neck, and facial region. The diagnosis of NF-1 was made based on the radiographic findings and National Institutes of Health (NIH) criteria. The patient was treated conservatively with follow-up."

This benign but locally invasive tumor, commonly associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1), arises from Schwann cells of the peripheral nerve sheath. In this report, we present a case of a 20-year-old male with a massive plexiform neurofibroma involving both the left parotid and submandibular glands. The patient had a painless swelling in the left preauricular region since 2 years, which had gradually enlarged over the last one year. Imaging revealed extensive involvement of the tumor, extending into the parapharyngeal space and infratemporal fossa. A surgical excision was performed, and a histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis. The extensive size and involvement of multiple salivary glands posed significant challenges in management, emphasizing the need for careful surgical planning and thorough clinical evaluation. This case highlights the rare occurrence of large plexiform neurofibromas in the salivary glands and underscores the complexities involved in treating such extensive tumors."

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations or deletions in the NF1 gene, with approximately 5% to 11% of cases specifically attributed to the 17q11.2 microdeletion. While cutaneous manifestations are common, gastrointestinal involvement occurs in 10%-25% of cases, with symptomatic presentations being exceptionally rare. This report describes an unusual case of NF1 presenting with small intestinal neurofibroma, emphasizing diagnostic challenges and management strategies. A 22-year-old male with a 1-year history of recurrent abdominal distension was admitted. Physical examination revealed pathognomonic features of NF1, including axillary freckling and café-au-lait macules. Laboratory tests demonstrated anemia and hypoalbuminemia. Imaging and enteroscopy identified a stenotic ileal lesion with mesenteric lymphadenopathy. Initial biopsy suggested neurofibroma, confirmed by whole-exome sequencing revealing a 17q11.2 microdeletion involving the NF1 gene. Following palliative ileostomy, definitive surgical resection achieved complete remission. Histopathology confirmed small intestinal neurofibroma in NF1. This case underscores that gastrointestinal neurofibromas, though uncommon, should be considered in NF1 patients with persistent abdominal symptoms. A combination of clinical assessment, imaging, endoscopy, and genetic testing is essential for accurate diagnosis. Surgical intervention remains the definitive treatment for symptomatic lesions. The report expands the phenotypic spectrum of NF1 and highlights the importance of multidisciplinary management in rare gastrointestinal manifestations."

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an inherited disorder that predisposes individuals to malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), a highly aggressive sarcoma with limited treatment options and poor prognosis. This study explores the potential of targeting the interaction between Galectin-1 and Ras as a novel therapeutic strategy for MPNSTs. Through molecular docking, we identified critical residues involved in the Galectin-1 and H-Ras interaction. We developed LLS30, a compound designed to target this Ras-binding pocket on Galectin-1, and tested its efficacy. LLS30 effectively disrupted the Galectin-1/Ras interaction, causing Ras delocalization from the plasma membrane and inhibiting Ras signaling. In vitro experiments showed that LLS30 significantly decreased MPNST cell proliferation and induced apoptosis. In vivo, LLS30 demonstrated potent anti-tumor effects, reducing tumor size, inhibiting metastasis, and extending survival in animal models. Transcriptome analysis further revealed the downregulation of KRAS signaling and inhibition of pathways associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition. These findings suggest that targeting Galectin-1 with LLS30 offers therapeutic potential for MPNSTs and could be beneficial for other cancers driven by Galectin-1 and Ras signaling."

Arterial rupture, including the rare involvement of the subclavian artery, can be life-threatening. We present a case of a ruptured inferior thyroid artery in a patient with NF1, presenting with a rapidly expanding neck hematoma. A 35-year-old male with a history of NF1 presented to the emergency department with sudden-onset right-sided neck swelling and pain. The swelling rapidly expanded, leading to severe dyspnea, irritability, and hoarseness, necessitating emergent intubation. After failed attempts of intubation, a surgical tracheostomy was performed. Imaging revealed active arterial extravasation at the inferior thyroid artery near the thyrocervical trunk, with a large neck hematoma extending into the mediastinum. Coil embolization was performed, resulting in a favorable outcome. Postoperative follow-up confirmed successful embolization and resolution of symptoms. NF1 is commonly associated with cutaneous manifestations but can also lead to vascular complications, including arterial stenosis and aneurysms, due to impaired vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cell function. Rupture of the inferior thyroid artery in NF1 is extremely rare and can present with symptoms such as hoarseness, dysphagia, and swelling, complicating initial diagnosis. Management of vascular complications in NF1 can be challenging due to the fragility of affected vessels. Endovascular interventions, such as coil embolization, offer a less invasive treatment option with promising outcomes. In this case, rapid airway management followed by angiographic embolization led to a successful resolution."

    "abstract": "BRAF and MEK inhibitors targeting the RAS/MAPK pathway are increasingly used in pediatric oncology, particularly for gliomas and neurofibromatosis type 1-associated plexiform neurofibromas (PN). While ocular adverse events (OAE), such as uveitis and MEK inhibitor-associated retinopathy (MEKAR), are well documented in adults, pediatric data remain limited, as are data regarding the effect on visual acuity (VA) in optic pathway gliomas (OPG) and orbital plexiform neurofibromas (OPN). This retrospective study reviewed pediatric patients treated with BRAF and/or MEK inhibitors (years 2015-2024). Ophthalmologic assessments, including VA and optical coherence tomography (OCT), were conducted at baseline and follow-up. Patients were categorized based on optic pathway involvement (OPG/OPN vs. non-OPG/OPN). Among 62 patients (120 eyes), OAE occurred in 3 (4.8%): 1/29 in the OPG/OPN group and 2/33 in the non-OPG/OPN group. All were reversible with dose adjustment or discontinuation. In the OPG/OPN group, VA data were available for 35 eyes, with stability in 74% (26/35), improvement in 17% (6/35), and a decline in 9% (3/35). In the non-OPG/OPN group (57 eyes), VA remained stable in 91% (52/57). Optic disc appearance, retinal nerve fiber layer thickness, and macular thickness remained stable over a 22-month median follow-up in both groups. BRAF and MEK inhibitors demonstrate ocular safety in children, including those with OPG/OPN, with rare, reversible OAE and stable VA. These findings support their use in pediatric patients even with optic pathway involvement. Regular ophthalmologic monitoring with OCT and VA assessments remains essential for safe, long-term use."

After preoperative chemotherapy, total left mastectomy and axillary lymph node dissection were performed. NF1 is an autosomal overt inherited disease characterized by multiple neurofibromas and pigment spots. It is called von Recklinghausen disease, and it is said that there are many complications of malignant tumors such as breast cancer, mainly nervous system tumors. In breast cancer complicated by NF1, there is a high rate of diagnosis as advanced cancer due to delayed awareness of breast masses due to unique skin lesions and a tendency to refrain from visiting medical institutions or medical examinations due to latent shame about appearance. In this study, we report 1 case of advanced breast cancer complicated by NF1."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common genetic condition; 0.1-5.7% of patients with NF1 will develop pheochromocytomas in their lifetime. However, other causes of hypertension (HT) in young patients can be present, and polycystic liver disease is not a part of NF1 syndrome. Polycystic liver disease had been described among patients with heterozygotic polycystic kidney and hepatic disease 1 (PKHD1) variant. We report a rare case of a young patient with NF1 who presented with HT and polycystic liver disease. CASE REPORT A 37-year-old Thai woman with history of NF-1 (clinically diagnosed at the age of 20 years from presence of cafe-au-lait spots and neurofibromas) had HT for 2 years without other symptoms. Abdominal computed tomography revealed polycystic liver disease and a simple renal cyst with both adrenal glands normal. Laboratory studies showed normal results. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) confirmed the molecular diagnosis of NF1 with heterozygous pathogenic variants c.5268+1G>A of NF1 and heterozygous pathogenic variants c.7594_7597del of PKHD1 gene. Given the results of genetic testing and no other identified causes of HT, co-occurrence of NF1 and HT-associated heterozygotic PKHD1 variant was diagnosed. CONCLUSIONS Our case highlights the diagnostic challenges of atypical phenotypes among individuals with NF1, which can depend on the background of other genes. With increasing affordability of WES, its utility in uncovering the possibility of being affected by 2 inherited genetic conditions should be considered when findings are incompatible with the primary disease."

    "abstract": "We describe a case of a 40-year-old Japanese woman with rapidly growing malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) arising from neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1). The patient presented numbness in both legs, back pain, and gait disturbances. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a spinal tumor at the thoracic level. To resolve her symptoms, a laminectomy and intradural tumor resection were performed. The tumor was diagnosed as a neurofibroma with no malignant characteristics. After the surgery, she participated in a rehabilitation program aimed at promoting independence in daily activities and enhancing muscle strength. Initially, her walking ability showed improvement; however, she soon experienced complications, including challenges with bowel movements and a gradual decline in her walking function. A follow-up MRI on the 67th day post-surgery showed tumor regrowth that necessitated reoperation. After the surgery, the neurological symptoms improved temporarily, but they worsened again, ultimately leading to a shift to palliative care and her demise several days later. This case underscores the challenges in pathological diagnosis and the aggressive nature of MPNSTs, emphasizing the need for vigilant monitoring and timely intervention. Despite initial surgical success, rapid tumor growth can occur during rehabilitation, highlighting the importance of a multidisciplinary approach for accurate diagnosis and treatment. Early detection of tumor progression through meticulous neurological monitoring and prompt surgical consultation are critical for optimal outcomes. Further research into more definitive diagnostic tools and effective treatment strategies for MPNSTs is crucial to improve patient care."

    "title": "From benign neurofibromas to malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST): a gaming among multiple factors.",
    "abstract": "Almost all patients of Neurofibromatosis Type I (NF1) develop benign peripheral nerve tumors called neurofibromas, which are derived from neural crest Schwann cell lineage progenitors with biallelic NF1 gene mutations. More than 90% of NF1 patients develop dermal neurofibromas (DN), and 25-50% develop plexiform neurofibromas (PN). In 8-13% of individuals with NF1, PN can transform into malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), a type of nerve soft tissue sarcoma that is the main cause of mortality of NF1 patients. In addition to arising from benign neurofibromas (50%), MPNSTs can also occur spontaneously (~40%) or following radiation therapy (~10%). Treatment for MPNST is limited to complete resection with negative margins. Still, the high recurrence of MPNST is a major concern. However, full resection of the pre-malignant lesions can largely reduce the recurrence and mortality of patients. So, early diagnosis and distinguishing malignancy from benign and premalignant lesions are particularly important. During the progression from benign neurofibromas to malignancy, a variety of changes including tumor morphology, genetic mutations, expression of multiple signaling pathways-related proteins and genome instability gradually occur. In this review, we detail these changes with the goals of identifying the histological and/or molecular signs of malignancy initiation, and an optimal therapeutic intervention window, to inhibit tumor progression and reduce the rate of mortality."

However, our understanding of the disorder is based on patients ascertained through phenotype-first approaches, which estimate prevalence at 1 in 3000. Leveraging a genotype-first approach in multiple large patient cohorts including over one million individuals, we demonstrate an unexpectedly high prevalence (1 in 1,286) of NF1 pathogenic variants. Half are identified in individuals lacking clinical features of NF1, with many appearing to have post-zygotic mosaicism for the identified variant. Incidentally discovered variants are not associated with classic neurofibromatosis features but are associated with an increased incidence of malignancy compared to control populations. Our findings suggest that NF1 pathogenic variants are substantially more common than previously thought, often characterized by somatic mosaicism and reduced penetrance, and are important contributors to cancer risk in the general population."

Primary cells cultured from control bone or fracture pseudarthroses from children with NF1 were treated with vehicle or with the MEK inhibitors trametinib or selumetinib. Gene expression was evaluated with use of transcriptome sequencing (RNAseq), and the activation of the downstream signaling pathway was evaluated with use of western blotting. Results were replicated in an independent cohort of patient fracture pseudarthrosis-derived primary cells. Pseudarthrosis samples were reproducibly associated with the reduced expression of gene signatures implicated in osteoblast differentiation, skeletal development, and the formation of the extracellular matrix. The expression of these gene signatures was significantly rescued following treatment with MEK inhibitors and concomitant reduced MEK/ERK (MAPK) pathway activation. Our study identified molecular signatures associated with fracture pseudarthrosis that were rescued with MEK inhibitor treatment. MEK inhibitors may promote the healing of fracture pseudarthroses in children with NF1."

During the search for breast cancer metastases in NF1 patients, there is a substantial probability of detecting malignancies other than breast cancer. We present a case of an 80-year-old woman with NF1 who was diagnosed with both invasive ductal carcinoma of the luminal-HER2 type in the breast and a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) of the liver. After noticing a lump in her right breast for 2 months, further examination confirmed breast cancer with metastases to the right axillary lymph nodes. A whole-body contrast-enhanced CT scan revealed large hepatic tumors initially suspected to be metastases from breast cancer. However, given the patient's underlying NF1, an ultrasound-guided liver biopsy was performed, which confirmed the diagnosis of MPNST. The patient had a history of surgical resection for the MPNST in the forearm. Due to the high metastatic potential of MPNST, the liver tumors were diagnosed as metastases of the MPNST. She declined chemotherapy for MPNST and is currently receiving endocrine therapy alone for breast cancer. It is necessary to acknowledge the predisposition of patients with NF1 to develop various tumors throughout the body. When performing a systemic evaluation for breast cancer in NF1 patients, any detected lesions should be thoroughly investigated for potential malignancies other than breast cancer metastasis.

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) is a genetic disorder resulting from mutations in the <i>NF1</i> gene, which increases susceptibility to various nervous system tumors, including plexiform neurofibromas, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, and optic pathway gliomas. Recent research has shown that these tumors are intricately connected to the complex, dynamic interactions within neurons, culminating in neuronal signaling that fosters tumor growth. These interactions offer crucial insights into the molecular mechanisms underpinning tumor development, as well as broader implications for therapeutic strategies. This review summarizes the mechanisms through which mutations in the <i>NF1</i> gene within neural tissues trigger tumorigenesis, while examining the role of the neuron-via factors such as visual experience, neurotransmitter, tumor microenvironment, and psychological influences-in both promoting tumor progression and being affected by the tumors themselves. By investigating the dynamic relationship between NF1-associated nervous system tumor cells and neurons, we aim to shed light on novel biological pathways and disease processes, emphasizing the potential of interdisciplinary approaches that combine neurobiology, oncology, and pharmacology to enhance treatment strategies and even inhibit the tumorigenesis."

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type I (NF1) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by extremely different phenotypes, sometimes including reduced bone mass. The underlying cause of bone impairment in these patients remains poorly understood, especially in children. Previous studies in mice and single reports in NF1 patients with osteomalacia have shown elevated serum FGF23 levels. The aim of this study was to explore for the first time these results in NF1 pediatric patients to eventually provide biological insight into bone involvement in NF1. This is an observational, cross-sectional, single-centre study evaluating FGF23/αKlotho levels, as well as other markers of bone metabolism and densitometric parameters in 31 children affected by NF1 and comparing them to 21 age- and sex-matched controls. We enrolled 31 patients with NF1(M/F 13/18; 11.7 ± 2.9 years). After correction for bone age, BMAD Z-score was < -2SDS in 5/31 patients (16.1%). No difference was found between FGF23 and αKlotho between NF1 patients and controls. No association was found between auxological, biochemical, genetic and radiological parameters and FGF23 values. In conclusion, this represents the first study assessing FGF23 levels in NF1 children and its possible relationship with decreased bone mineral density. Contrarily to previous observations, no significant differences were found between NF1 patients and controls regarding FGF23 and αKlotho levels. Additionally, there was no clear association between FGF23 and bone involvement, thus suggesting that this phenomenon is not FGF23-driven or FGF23 derangements might occur later in life. Further research is needed to understand the multifactorial mechanisms and determine optimal intervention strategies."

    "abstract": "Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) is a highly aggressive sarcoma that may be seen in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) or occur sporadically. While surgery is the primary treatment for localized MPNST with a 61.9% overall survival rate, metastatic disease is often fatal due to resistance to systemic therapies which underscores the urgent need for effective treatments. MPNSTs frequently harbor inactivating driver mutations in the PRC2 epigenetic repressor complex suggesting epigenetic therapies may represent a specific vulnerability in these tumors. Here, we investigate the role of the LSD1-HDAC1-CoREST (LHC) repressor complex in mediating MPNST tumor growth and progression. Our findings demonstrate that the LHC small molecule inhibitor, corin, induces apoptosis and significantly inhibits proliferation in MPNST cells. Transcriptomic analysis of corin-treated MPNST cells demonstrates specific increases in genes associated with axonogenesis and neuronal differentiation as well as altered extracellular matrix; additionally, corin treatment is shown to inhibit MPNST invasion in vitro. These results underscore the critical role of the LHC complex in facilitating MPNST growth and progression and suggest that targeting the LHC complex represents a promising therapeutic approach for this aggressive malignancy."

    "title": "Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor presenting in the cauda equina: diagnostic and biological pearls. Illustrative case.",
    "abstract": "Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are rare and highly malignant tumors of neural crest origin. No matter their anatomical location, they are difficult to treat and carry a poor prognosis. This report highlights the complexities of the diagnosis and management of a patient with MPNST of the cauda equina. The tumor retained the expression of H3K27me3, which is expected in spinal MPNSTs but uncommon in most sporadic and neurofibromatosis type 1-driven MPNSTs. The described diagnostic nuance should be taken into consideration in patients with suspected MPNST of the cauda equina, as these tumors require swift neurosurgical intervention in order to maintain neurological function. Additional treatment modalities include neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Although improvements in local control and progression-free survival have been reported, the role of radiation therapy and chemotherapy has been underinvestigated due to the rarity of MPNSTs presenting in this region. https://thejns.org/doi/10.3171/CASE24723."

    "title": "The effect of lamotrigine on cortical inhibition and plasticity in Neurofibromatosis type 1: Exploratory analysis of a randomized controlled trial (NF1-EXCEL).",
    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a genetic disorder associated with cognitive and behavioral deficits. In NF1, decreased neurofibromin levels attenuate hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channel 1 (HCN1) activity, thereby increasing inhibitory interneuron activity and decreasing synaptic plasticity. Lamotrigine, an HCN1-agonist, rescued this electrophysiological phenotype in an NF1 mouse model. We investigated whether lamotrigine can alter cortical inhibition and plasticity in adolescents with NF1 using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). We performed an explorative analysis of secondary outcomes in the NF1-EXCEL trial (Clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT02256124). Thirty-one adolescents with NF1 were randomized to either receive lamotrigine or a placebo. Using TMS, cortical inhibition was assessed with short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) and cortical plasticity with paired associative stimulation (PAS) at baseline and after 10 weeks of intervention. Lamotrigine did not affect baseline cortical excitability. Additionally, no significant effects on either SICI or PAS responses were found after lamotrigine treatment in adolescents with NF1. Finally, lamotrigine did not affect pre-PAS single-pulse cortical excitability measures. 10-week lamotrigine treatment does not alter cortical inhibition and plasticity in adolescents with NF1. While limited by a small sample size, our study indicates that lamotrigine cannot consistently modulate SICI or PAS in adolescents with NF1, suggesting limited potential for treating the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms."

    "title": "Development in children with neurofibromatosis type 1 in early childhood.",
    "abstract": "The development of children with NF1 has so far been primarily studied in school-age children with various subtests showing heterogeneous profiles. The aim of this study is to characterise the development of infants with NF1 across all areas of early childhood development. 32 infants with NF1, aged 12-47 months, participated in this cross-sectional cohort study. Development was assessed with the MFED 1-4 comprising 7 test categories. Items measuring visual abilities (colour and visuospatial items) from all subcategories were selected and compared to the normal population. Infants with NF1 showed a global developmental delay, more pronounced in application of memorised knowledge. A particular deficit was found in items requiring spatial vision. The present study is the first to examine the global development of children with NF1 under 48 months. Consistent with animal data, we found significant deficits in visuospatial abilities, which may significantly contribute to the perceived global developmental delay. These findings underline the need for early and specific developmental therapy in this patient group in order to train the development early in infancy and to achieve the best neurodevelopmental outcome."

    "title": "Identifying patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 related optic pathway glioma using the OMOP CDM.",
    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a rare tumour predisposition syndrome. Optic pathway gliomas (NF1-related OPG) are a well-characterised tumour type. There is great need for tools that can efficiently identify patients with NF1-related OPG at hospitals. Computable phenotypes algorithms can be used to find patients with certain clinical features in an electronic database. We developed computable phenotype algorithms using the Observational Medical Outcome Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model. We subsequently assessed if these algorithms could identify patients with NF1-related OPG in an electronic health records (EHR) derived database. We created phenotype algorithms based on diagnosis codes, visits, and radiologic procedures. These phenotypes were applied to the EHR-derived database of an academic hospital. To assess the performance of the phenotypes, we calculated the precision, recall, and F2 score against a list of known cases (n = 61), provided by a clinician. To evaluate the ability of the phenotypes to identify additional cases, we manually reviewed the predicted positives of each phenotype algorithm. The phenotype algorithm based on the diagnosis codes 'Neurofibromatosis syndrome' and 'Neoplasm of optic nerve' performed best (precision = 1.000, recall = 0.614, F2-score = 0.665). The phenotype 'Neurofibromatosis syndrome and three or more Ophthalmology visits and one or more MRI of brain' performed best of the phenotypes based on visits and radiologic procedures (precision = 0.489, recall = 0.511, F2-score = 0.507). Generally, increased precision came at the cost of a decrease in recall. Following review of the predicted positives of each phenotype, 27 additional cases were identified. OMOP computable phenotype algorithms successfully identified NF1-related OPG patients in an EHR-derived database. They provided swift insight into the number of NF1-related OPG cases and were able to identify additional cases, which were not included in the original list of known cases. Phenotype algorithms created with OMOP could be an invaluable tool to facilitate patient screening, especially in multi-centric trials for rare diseases."

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant disorder with a 5-15 % risk of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), of which 20-30 % may be malignant. Standard treatment includes surgery and adjuvant imatinib for high-risk cases. This case presents a rare large GIST in NF1 without organ invasion. A 39-year-old male with NF1 presented with a 6-month history of progressive abdominal distension and intermittent pain. Examination revealed typical NF1 signs, including café-au-lait spots, neurofibromas, and Lisch nodules. Imaging showed a large proximal ileal mass, suggestive of GIST. Surgery confirmed a well-circumscribed tumor, and histology revealed high-risk spindle-cell GIST with positive CD117 and DOG1 staining. The patient started adjuvant imatinib therapy for 3 years. Six months postoperatively, he remained asymptomatic with no recurrence on imaging. Regular follow-ups with CT scans and blood tests were scheduled to monitor disease progression and treatment response. NF1 is an autosomal dominant disorder with an increased risk of developing GISTs, which occur earlier and are more aggressive than sporadic cases. GIST diagnosis relies on imaging, with CT and MRI providing essential details, and confirmation through histopathology with CD117 and DOG1 markers. Surgical resection remains the primary treatment, with adjuvant imatinib recommended for high-risk cases to reduce recurrence. NF1-related GISTs have higher recurrence rates but respond well to targeted therapy. Regular follow-up with imaging is crucial. Although GISTs are rare in NF1, they pose a significant risk due to their potential for malignancy and recurrence."

    "abstract": "This review aims to synthesize current knowledge regarding the use of bisphosphonates (BPs) in the treatment of bone complications in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). NF1 is a genetic disorder marked by multiple benign tumors of the nervous system and various skeletal abnormalities, such as osteoporosis and an increased risk of fractures. BPs are drugs that inhibit bone resorption, commonly used to treat osteoporosis and other bone diseases. The review identified multiple studies examining the effects of BP therapy in NF1 patients. Most studies reported improvements in bone mineral density and reduced fracture occurrence. The most commonly reported side effects were mild gastrointestinal symptoms and transient musculoskeletal pain. However, the evidence is limited by the small number of studies and the heterogeneity of patient populations and treatment protocols. In conclusion, BPs show improvements in managing NF1 complications such as osteoporosis and a reduction of fracture risk in NF1 patients. While the existing studies suggest positive outcomes, there is a need for more rigorous, large-scale studies to establish standardized treatment protocols and long-term safety profiles. Healthcare providers should consider BP therapy as a potential option for NF1 patients with significant bone complications, while also monitoring for possible adverse effects."

    "abstract": "The FDA has granted approval for the use of selumetinib in the treatment of pediatric patients who are at least 2 years old and have neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) with symptomatic, inoperable plexiform neurofibromas (PN). Nevertheless, the safety of selumetinib over an extended period of time in sizable cohorts remains uncertain. The objective of the present study was to assess the adverse events (AEs) associated with selumetinib by analyzing data from the US food and drug administration adverse event reporting system (FAERS). The FAERS database was retrospectively queried to extract reports associated with selumetinib from the third quarter of 2020 to the first quarter of 2024. To identify and evaluate potential AEs in patients receiving selumetinib, various disproportionality analyses such as the reporting odds ratio (ROR), the proportional reporting ratio (PRR), the Bayesian confidence propagation neural network (BCPNN), and the multi-item gamma Poisson shrinker (MGPS) were employed. A total of 546 reports of selumetinib as the \"primary suspected (PS)\" and 1437 cases of selumetinib-induced AEs were identified. 42 AE signals were detected at the preferred term (PT) level after complying with four algorithms simultaneously. Commonly significant signals for cardiotoxicity, ocular toxicity, skin toxicity, and increased creatine phosphokinase have been observed. Additionally, previously reported AE signals such as proteinuria were detected. Most AEs related to selumetinib occur within the first month after the initiation of therapy. Our study improves the comprehension of selumetinib's safety profile by offering a thorough analysis of the adverse events (AEs) recorded post-marketing. These findings highlight the necessity of ongoing surveillance to detect and assess any adverse events linked to selumetinib."

    "abstract": "Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are caused by mutations in the <i>KIT</i> and platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha genes in approximately 90% of cases. A minority of wild-type GISTs are associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), an autosomal dominant genetic disease resulting from pathogenic mutations in the NF1 gene, which encodes the neurofibromin protein. NF1 patients often exhibit multi-system involvement, with café-au-lait macules and neurofibromas being characteristic symptoms. GISTs are a rare complication of NF1, with the tumors most frequently occurring in the small intestine (90% of cases), while occurrences in the stomach are rare. A 51-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with complaints of dizziness, fatigue, chest tightness, and dark stools. Initial examination revealed a red blood cell count of 1.99 × 10<sup>12</sup>/L and a hemoglobin level of 43 g/L. She underwent blood transfusions and fluid replacement to stabilize her condition. Further investigations identified typical café-au-lait macules on her trunk, limbs, and face, along with neurofibromas. Endoscopy showed coffee-colored fluid in the gastric cavity, a large submucosal elevation with an exudative covering, and ulcer formation on the gastric fundus. Exploratory laparoscopy confirmed the tumor's origin in the gastric fundus, and resection of the giant GIST was performed. Pathological analysis revealed a necrotic GIST measuring 18 cm × 14 cm, classified as high-risk, with approximately 5 mitotic figures per 10 high-power fields and no tumor at the margins. Immunohistochemistry results were CD117 (+), delay of germination 1 (+), CD34 (+), and succinate dehydrogenase complex iron sulfur subunit B intact expression. Genetic testing using next-generation sequencing confirmed an NF1 gene mutation. The patient underwent successful tumor resection and was discharged home with postoperative regorafenib therapy. A follow-up at one year showed no recurrence. Given the diversity of clinical symptoms associated with NF1 and the complexity of NF1-related GISTs, surgical resection with complete tumor removal remains the preferred treatment option. However, the absence of a standardized treatment protocol for adjuvant therapy presents numerous challenges for clinicians."

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis Type 1 is a genetic condition diagnosed in infancy that substantially increases the likelihood of a child experiencing cognitive and developmental difficulties, including Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Children with NF1 show clear differences in attention, but whether these differences emerge in early development and how they relate to broader difficulties with cognitive and learning skills is unclear. To address this question requires longitudinal prospective studies from infancy, where the relation between domains of visual attention (including exogenous and endogenous shifting) and cognitive development can be mapped over time. We report data from 28 infants with NF1 tested longitudinally at 5, 10 and 14 months compared to cohorts of 29 typical likelihood infants (with no history of NF1 or ASD and/or ADHD), and 123 infants with a family history of ASD and/or ADHD. We used an eyetracking battery to measure both exogenous and endogenous control of visual attention. Infants with NF1 demonstrated intact social orienting, but slower development of endogenous visual foraging. This slower development presented as prolonged engagement with a salient stimulus in a static display relative to typically developing infants. In terms of exogenous attention shifting, NF1 infants showed faster saccadic reaction times than typical likelihood infants. However, the NF1 group demonstrated a slower developmental improvement from 5 to 14 months of age. Individual differences in foraging and saccade times were concurrently related to visual reception abilities within the full infant cohort (NF1, typical likelihood and those with a family history of ASD/ADHD). Our results provide preliminary evidence that alterations in saccadic reaction time and visual foraging may contribute to learning difficulties in infants with NF1."

    "abstract": "Pilocytic astrocytoma (PA) is the most common pediatric tumor, typically located in the cerebellum, with spontaneous regression observed mainly in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). However, spontaneous regression of PA without NF1 is rarely reported. Here, we describe a case of spontaneous regression of PA without NF1, located in the left frontal lobe with FGFR1-TACC1 fusion, in a 14-year-old boy who presented with epilepsy. Initial MRI revealed a lesion in the left middle frontal gyrus, and subsequent follow-up MRI demonstrated spontaneous regression. Despite this regression, the patient's seizures persisted, leading to epileptic focus resection. Pathological examination confirmed PA with characteristic histological findings and FGFR1-TACC1 fusion. This case suggests that FGFR1-TACC1 fusion may be linked to spontaneous regression of PA, even in the absence of NF1. Surgical intervention may remain necessary in cases of epilepsy associated with PA, regardless of tumor regression."

Granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor receptor-β (GM-CSFR-β<sup>c</sup>) is a shared component of receptors for the cytokines GM-CSF, IL-3, and IL-5, ligands with immunomodulatory and tumor promoting roles.

Genetic deletion of GM-CSFR-β<sup>c</sup> in this model reduced the number of PNFs, which was associated with decreased numbers of tumor-associated Iba1+ macrophages and CD11c+ dendritic cells (DC), while loss of GM-CSFR-α had no effect. Deletion of GM-CSFR-α or GM-CSFR-β<sup>c</sup> did not improve mouse survival or the structure of Remak bundles in peripheral nerves. Proteome analysis of tumor lysates showed altered levels of numerous cytokines after receptor loss, suggesting that the compensatory effects of other cyto/chemokines maintain a proinflammatory environment promoting neurofibroma. Thus, GM-CSFR-β<sup>c</sup> signaling contributes modestly to neurofibroma formation, apparently independently of its ligand GM-CSF."

    "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> The current standard therapy for pediatric optic pathway/hypothalamic glioma (OPHG) is systemic anticancer therapy (SAT) over surgery and radiotherapy. Nevertheless, recurrent radiological or clinical tumor progression after SAT forms a considerable challenge. Sporadic OPHGs are considered to have a higher tendency toward progression after first-line systemic anticancer therapy (SAT) compared to neurofibromatosis type-1-associated (NF1) OPHGs. <b>Methods:</b> The objective of this study was to conduct a national retrospective cohort analysis of children who received various treatments for a progressive OPHG, involving the hypothalamus and/or chiasm and/or optic radiations. The study aimed to examine the differences in clinical course and the range of treatment modalities applied to both sporadic and NF1-associated OPHGs between 1995 and 2020. Additionally, we sought to identify risk factors for 3- and 5-year progression following first- and second-order SAT. <b>Results:</b> In total, 136 children received treatment, of whom 49 of 136 (36.0%) had NF1. Within a median of 7.5 years (range: 0.1-23.8 years) of follow-up, sporadic OPHGs received more treatments compared to NF1-associated OPHGs (median of 2 (range: 1-8) vs. median of 1 (range: 1-7) (<i>p</i> < 0.01)). Nine children with sporadic OPHGs (6.6%) died. Of 112 children (82.4%) receiving SAT, 92% received combined first-line vincristine and carboplatin. These children had a 3- and 5-year progression-free survival of 61.8% (95% CI: 51.0-72.6%) and 48.4% (95% CI: 38.0-58.8%), respectively. Sporadic OPHGs had a higher rate of second progression (<i>p</i> < 0.01). Starting first-line vincristine and carboplatin at an age below one year was the only independent risk factor for progression. <b>Conclusions:</b> In this national historic cohort of pediatric OPHGs, four out of five children received SAT. Sporadic OPHGs received a higher number of various SATs compared to NF1-associated OPHGs, but the sporadic appearance of OPHGs was not an independent risk factor for progression after combined vincristine and carboplatin, as 'age below one year at the start' was the only factor."

This retrospective study included children with a genetically proven diagnosis of NF1. Clinical characteristics and outcomes, including best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), refractive error, ocular motility, specific ophthalmological findings (e.g., Lisch nodules), and the presence of cutaneous café au lait stains were evaluated. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were obtained to evaluate optic nerve abnormalities and early detection of optic glioma. One hundred and sixty-eight eyes of 85 children were included. The mean follow-up of the patients was 8 ± 3.7 years (range: 2-19 years) and mean age at baseline was 3.1 ± 2.6 years. Mean (±SD) BCVA was 0.19 (±0.20) logMAR at baseline. 16.5% of patients showed the presence of optic nerve abnormalities, 18.8% had therapy, 32.9% of the patients had cafe au lait stains, and 37.1% had Lisch nodules in the eye examination. Worse BCVA at baseline was associated with the presence of severe optic nerve abnormalities (mean 0.21 ± 0.14 logMAR; p < 0.01), compared to patients without optic nerve abnormalities (mean 0.14 ± 0.14 logMAR). Additionally, BCVA at baseline was dependent on the visual test (from mean 0.04 ± 0.19 logMAR to mean 0.3 ± 0.16 logMAR; p < 0.01). There was also a significant difference in BCVA change to follow-up in patients who received therapy compared to patients who did not (p = 0.033). The age showed no significant influence on the BCVA at baseline (p = 0.92). Optic nerve glioma poses a significant threat to vision in NF1 patients, necessitating biannual follow-up until age 6, including MRI, fundoscopy, and OCT imaging."

    "abstract": "Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) is the leading cause of premature death among individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), and the transcriptional aberrations that precede malignant transformation and contribute to MPNST tumorigenesis remain poorly defined. Alterations involving CDKN2A and components of PRC2 have been implicated as early drivers of peripheral nerve sheath tumor (PNST) evolution, but these events do not occur in all MPNST. Accordingly, emerging data have begun to highlight the importance of molecular-based stratification to improve outcomes in patients with NF1-PNST. In this study, we perform an integrated analysis of multiple, independent datasets obtained from human patients with NF1 to gain critical insights into PNST evolution and MPNST heterogeneity. We show that delta-like noncanonical Notch ligand 1 (DLK1) is significantly increased in MPNST and provide evidence that DLK1 overexpression may precede histologic changes consistent with malignancy. In complementary analyses, we find that serum levels of DLK1 are significantly higher in both mice and humans harboring MPNST compared with those without malignancy. Importantly, although DLK1 expression is increased in MPNST overall, through the integration of multiple, independent datasets, we demonstrate that divergent levels of DLK1 expression distinguish MPNST subsets characterized by unique molecular programs and potential therapeutic vulnerabilities. Specifically, we show that overexpression of DLK1 is associated with the reactivation of embryonic signatures, an immunosuppressive microenvironment, and a worse overall survival in patients with NF1-MPNST. Collectively, our findings provide critical insights into MPNST tumorigenesis and support prospective studies evaluating the utility of DLK1 tissue and serum levels in augmenting diagnosis, risk assessment, and therapeutic stratification in the setting of NF1-PNST."

Large proportions of individuals with pathogenic variation in <i>NF1</i>, <i>FBN1</i>, or <i>PKD1/PKD2</i> lack the associated diagnosis of NF1 (47%), Marfan syndrome (58%), or ADPKD (51%), respectively. Pathogenic variants in diagnosed individuals have greater inferred deleteriousness for NF1 and ADPKD, and undiagnosed individuals had less severe phenotypes compared to diagnosed individuals for all three conditions. A genotype-first ascertainment of individuals in genomic research allows for a more comprehensive assessment of Mendelian disease and removes biases that confound our understanding of the penetrance and presentation of these conditions."

We investigated quantitative T1 mapping (QT1) as a clinically feasible tool for measuring myelination in children with neurodevelopmental disorders of the RAS-MAPK signaling pathway (RASopathies). We collected QT1, diffusion-weighted, and structural MRI scans from 72 children (49 RASopathies, 23 typical developing (TD)). QT1 measures of myelin content included the macromolecular tissue volume (MTV) in white matter and R1 (1/T1 relaxation) of the cortex. For white matter, we assessed between-groups differences across 39 tracts. For cortical R1, we used principal components analysis to reduce dimensionality and capture myelination patterns across 360 regions. A multivariate ANOVA assessed differences across principal components. Finally, a support vector machine (SVM) identified the most discriminative features between TD and RASopathies. Thirty-four of 39 tracts were higher in MTV in RASopathies relative to TD (<i>p<sub>FDR</sub></i> <.05), indicating widespread elevation in myelination. Our MANOVA revealed a group effect on cortical R1 (<i>p</i>=.002, <i>η<sup>2</sup></i> =.028), suggesting cortical myelination differences between-groups. SVM yielded an accuracy of 87% and identified cognitive and cortical R1 features as the most discriminant between-groups. We found widespread elevated myelin in white matter tracts and region-dependent patterns of cortical myelination in children with RASopathies. QT1 enabled us to leverage preclinical models showing oligodendrocyte dysfunction to uncover the myelination pattern <i>in vivo</i> in the developing human brain. Using QT1, myelin represents a promising treatment target that can be identified and monitored in neurodevelopmental disorders, offering significant potential for advancing current therapeutic strategies."

NF1 patients ≤16 years old followed at our institution between 2010 and 2022 were included. Presence of NF1-related ocular signs was assessed at baseline and during follow-up evaluations through slit lamp observation (LNs), near-infrared imaging (CAs and RVAs), and neuroimaging revision (OPG). Patients were categorized according to their genetic variant. A total of 237 patients were enrolled. Among those, 204 underwent at least 1 follow-up and genetic test was available for 210. Prevalence of OPG, LNs, CAs, and RVAs at baseline was, respectively, 20.7%, 43.5%, 46.8%, and 6.8%. Their incidence during follow-up was 6.4%, 22.4%, 21.4%, and 5.4%, respectively, and the mean age at onset was 6.3±3.6, 7.1±3.0, 6.4±3.0, and 6.6±2.9 years. Patients with truncating mutations presented a higher number of ocular signs than those with non-truncating mutations (1.7±1.0 vs 0.9±0.9, P = .0019). Data on prevalence and incidence of NF1-related ocular signs in pediatric patients evidences that the development of these signs seems negligible after the age of 7. LNs and CAs seem to develop independently and, therefore, can be considered as two separate diagnostic criteria. Truncating mutations correlate with a higher number of NF1-related ocular signs phenotype. Note: Publication of this article is sponsored by the American Ophthalmological Society."

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) increases the risk of developing GISTs, particularly in younger individuals, and often presents with atypical features. A 16-year-old female with a known diagnosis of NF1 presented with severe anemia, hematemesis, and melena. Physical examination revealed multiple café-au-lait spots and cutaneous nodular masses. A contrast-enhanced CT scan showed a large mass arising from the stomach's greater curvature, consistent with GIST. The patient underwent a sleeve gastrectomy, and histopathological evaluation confirmed high-grade spindle cell GIST. Immunohistochemistry was positive for CD117, CD34, and DOG-1. Postoperative PET-CT showed no residual disease. GIST in NF1 patients typically presents with a multifocal pattern, but our patient exhibited a rare unifocal GIST in the stomach. The diagnosis was complicated by atypical presentation and required multimodal imaging and histopathological confirmation. NF1-associated GISTs generally lack KIT and PDGFRA mutations, rendering targeted therapies like imatinib ineffective, emphasizing surgical management as the primary treatment. This case highlights the unique clinical and pathological characteristics of NF1-associated GISTs, stressing the need for vigilant assessment in NF1 patients with gastrointestinal symptoms."

His initial estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 71.9 mL/min/1.73m², with MRI showing bilateral cystic renal enlargement (total kidney volume: 758 mL). One year later, his eGFR declined to 56.7 mL/min/1.73m², and kidney volume increased by 10.4% over one year. Tolvaptan was initiated, and he remains under follow-up. Mutations in the PKD1/PKD2, which are responsible for ADPKD, affect intracellular signaling, including the mammalian target of the rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, leading to cyst formation and progression, while NF1 mutations overactivate the Ras proteins. His disease progression was more severe than that of his father with ADPKD alone, suggesting NF1 may have accelerated cyst enlargement. The co-occurrence of ADPKD and NF1 is extremely rare, with only a few cases reported in the past."

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a neurocutaneous genetic disorder inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. Typical clinical manifestations include multiple café-au-lait spots, axillary and inguinal freckling, Lisch nodules (iris hamartomas), and neurofibromas. We present the case of a 27-year-old male patient from Ethiopia who presented to the emergency room with progressively increasing swelling in the right gluteal area following a road traffic accident (RTA) that occurred one day earlier. Upon evaluation, the patient was in hypovolemic shock with right gluteal swelling accompanied by skin ecchymosis and findings suggestive of NF1. Imaging revealed soft tissue tumors with internal bleeding and hematoma. A clinical diagnosis of NF1 with bleeding into a tumor was established. The patient was resuscitated and taken to the operating room, where an en bloc tumor excision and hematoma evacuation were performed. The patient was discharged on the fourth postoperative day with follow-up appointments scheduled and referred to neurology and ophthalmology clinics for further evaluation. Discrete cutaneous neurofibromas are the most common presentation in NF1 and consist of soft, sessile, or pedunculated tumors. Although rare, they can present with life-threatening intratumoral bleeding. Patients with neurofibromatosis can present with large hematomas that lead to hemodynamic instability due to bleeding into tumors secondary to trauma. Surgical management in such cases serves both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes."

    "abstract": "Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) occur in ∼7% of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) patients. Data about their natural history remain scarce and neither risk classifications, prognosis model nor adjuvant treatment have been validated in this population. This national retrospective study included consecutive operated NF1-GIST cases from 31 reference centers in France, mostly from the NETSARC+ network. Factors associated with relapse were used to build a new prognostic score (RECKGIST). To address potential bias between adjuvant group and follow-up group, a propensity score was used. A total of 119 patients were included between 2008 and 2023, of whom 61% were women. Median age was 53 years (range 20-78 years). The main primary location was the small bowel (86%) and the stomach (11%). Median size and mitotic count (mit) were 45 mm [95% confidence interval (CI) 45-58 mm] and 2 mit/5 mm<sup>2</sup> (95% CI 3-9 mit/5 mm<sup>2</sup>), respectively. The vast majority were KIT/PDGFRA wild type (mutation KIT 2%, PDGFRA 3%). The median follow-up was 6 years. For GISTs <30 mm (n = 35), none relapsed. For GISTS >30 mm (n = 84), 18 developed metastases (21%). There was no difference in relapse according to tumor location (P = 0.45) or tumor rupture (P = 0.11), whereas KIT/PDGFRA-mutated GISTs were at higher risk of relapse [recurrence-free survival (RFS) at 10 years of 30% versus 82.5% for wild type, P = 0.03]. Miettinen and Joensuu classification did not predict relapse accurately. For the RECKGIST score A (size ≤30 mm, n = 34) group, 10-year RFS was 100%; it was 78.5% in the RECKGIST B group (size >30 mm and 0 < mit ≤ 5, n = 60), and 45.5% in the RECKGIST C group (size >30 mm and mit >5, n = 20) (P < 0.0001). After matching, 10-year RFS was similar between adjuvant and surveillance groups (P = 0.34). For NF1-GISTs <30 mm, prognosis without relapse is excellent. RECKGIST score accurately predicts recurrence and needs to be validated in an external cohort, but it may help treatment decision making. No efficacy of adjuvant treatment was observed."

We report the first documented case of HGAP in Pakistan in a 57-year-old woman with tremors, vertigo, and cerebellar signs. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a cerebellar lesion, and after resection, initial pathology suggested a pilocytic astrocytoma. Molecular testing confirmed HGAP with a CDKN2A/B deletion. Despite treatment, including a second surgery, the disease progressed. This case highlights the diagnostic challenges of HGAP and underscores the importance of advanced molecular testing for accurate diagnosis. Given the poor prognosis and limited treatment options, further research is needed to understand this rare tumor entity better and improve patient outcomes."

Schwannomas arise from the Schwann cells as do neurofibromas and are usually solitary except in Von Recklinghausen's disease. The occurrence of a schwannoma in the head and neck region is about 25%; however, submandibular gland schwannoma is a rare form of an extracranial neurogenic tumor arising from peripheral, central, or autonomic nerves. We report a rare case of a submandibular schwannoma in a patient with neurofibromatosis 1 which presented as a painless swelling in the submandibular region, treated by total excision of the submandibular gland. There was no postoperative deficit or recurrence within 3 months of follow-up. Our findings in this case suggest schwannoma of the salivary gland as a differential diagnosis of swelling in the submandibular area although rare, especially in a patient with neurofibromatosis 1."

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder, and mutations in the NF1 gene lead to RAS overactivation, which stimulates abnormal cell proliferation and can cause various tumors. The c.1748A > G mutation in the NF1 gene was initially classified as a missense mutation, but has also been suggested to be a splice mutation. It is thought that the substitution of A for G generates a cryptic splice site, resulting in a 27 bp deletion in the mRNA transcript, but this conclusion has not been documented in currently available databases. The present study was conducted to establish whether the NF1 c.1748A > G mutation induces a splicing error, and to determine whether it is pathogenic i.e. activates RAS and increases the expression of NF1-related downstream signaling molecules. We have confirmed by RT-PCR analysis of NF1 transcripts produced in the patient's peripheral blood lymphocytes as well as in a minigene construct and in iPSCs harboring the c.1748A > G mutation that this mutation creates a cryptic splice site which has the effect of deleting the first 27 bases of exon 16, and leading to transcriptional haploinsufficiency. Additionally, NPCs expressing the splicing mutant exhibited increased phosphorylation of NF1-related AKT/mTOR and Raf/MEK/Erk, as well as more effective wound healing and chemotaxis. We conclude that the NF1 c.1748A > G mutation acts as a splice mutation forming a novel cryptic site, causing a 27 bp deletion in the mRNA. This leads to increased expression of NF1-related downstream signaling molecules through RAS activation, inducing cell proliferation and potential tumor formation."

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant hereditary tumor predisposition syndrome. In approximately 30% of cases, plexiform neurofibromas (PNFs) are identified, which are precursor lesions for malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs). MPNST is a major cause of the reduced life expectancy of NF1 patients. The patient, a two-year-old at the time of surgical treatment, had been diagnosed with an orbital nerve sheath tumor causing lid swelling and ptosis since birth. The tumor showed disproportionately rapid growth, leading to increasing functional (mechanical) restrictions in lid elevation. Surgical exploration of the orbit indicated a PNF with areas of a MPNST. Two months later, a new biopsy confirmed the MPNST. The tumor was treated with multimodal chemotherapy. After completion of chemotherapy, orbital exenteration was performed. The tissue specimens only comprised tissue of a benign PNF. However, within six months, the patient developed an intracranial recurrence and died from a rapidly growing intracerebral tumor fraction, which histologically proved to be a MPNST. Orbital PNF is a rare and characteristic manifestation of facial NF1. Typically, tumors in this localization are associated with severe functional disabilities and aesthetic disfigurement, resulting from invasive tumor growth and skeletal deformities. Histological classification of the tumors may be challenging due to varying histological differentiation in different tumor locations. Thus, early diagnosis with representative tumor sampling and complete histological work-up of the specimen together with multimodal therapy are essential prerequisites to overcome the poor prognosis of these tumors."

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)- and NF2-related schwannomatosis are rare autosomal dominant monogenic disorders characterized by a predisposition for nerve-associated tumors. Current treatments focus on symptomatic management, but advancements in the gene therapy field present unique opportunities to treat the genetic underpinnings and develop curative therapies for NF. Approaches such as nonsense suppression agents and oligonucleotide therapies are becoming more mature and have emerging preclinical data in the context of NF. Furthermore, there has been progress in developing gene therapy vectors that can be delivered locally into tumors to ablate or shrink their size. While still a nascent research area, gene addition and gene repair strategies hold tremendous promise for the prevention and treatment of NF-related tumors. These technologies will also require parallel development of delivery vectors able to target the Schwann cells from which tumors most commonly arise. This review seeks to contextualize these advancements and which hurdles remain for their clinical adoption."

However, baseline ophthalmic findings and MEK inhibitor-related complications in children are underreported. The medical records of patients <21 years of age who underwent MEK inhibitor treatment at our institution between 2016 and 2023 were reviewed retrospectively. Patients with baseline examination and at least one follow-up eye examination were included. Systemic and ophthalmic diagnoses, MEK inhibitor treatment course, and ocular findings were extracted from the record. A total of 45 patients (23 males) were treated with a MEK inhibitor for tumor with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1, n = 20), tumor without NF1 (n = 22), or non-tumor (n = 3) at a mean age of 9.4 ± 4.8 years. Nineteen patients were treated with trametinib, 20 with selumetinib, and 6 with combined trametinib and dabrafenib. Thirty-three patients (73%), all with neurological tumors, had abnormal baseline eye examinations, including optic nerve abnormalities (n = 20), visual acuity impairment (n = 17), visual field defect (n = 8), strabismus (n = 10), or anterior segment abnormalities (n = 14). Average time on MEK inhibitors was 445.5 ± 377.8 days. Three patients with neurologic tumors without NF1 developed ophthalmic side effects of dry eye syndrome (n = 1) or symptomatic anterior uveitis (n = 2) at 6-7 months after initiation of MEK inhibitor. All 3 patients responded to topical medications. The majority of children started on MEK inhibitors had baseline eye abnormalities due to ocular or visual pathway involvement of neurological tumors. Ophthalmic side effects of MEK inhibitors occurred in 7% of children. Additional studies are required to formulate screening guidelines for the pediatric population."

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and schwannomatosis (SWN) are rare genetic disorders with distinct genetic etiologies. Both syndromes are predominantly characterized by the development of multiple benign nerve sheath tumors, which typically arise from cranial/peripheral nerves. The management of NF1/SWN-associated benign nerve sheath tumors pose a substantial clinical challenge. In recent years, immunotherapy has demonstrated significant efficacy in treating various tumors, but its application to NF1/SWN has not been explored. In this study, we first evaluated the feasibility of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy for the treatment of benign NF1/SWN-related nerve sheath tumor by analyzing the expression of multiple antigens in 85 tumor samples. Our findings revealed that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR/HER1) was highly expressed in most samples, indicating its potential as an ideal target for CAR-T cell therapy. Additionally, TGFβ1 and PDL1, key inhibitory regulators of T cell function within solid tumor microenvironment (TME), were universally overexpressed in these samples, highlighting the immunosuppressive nature of NF1/SWN tumors. To target HER1, we constructed CARs using three distinct scFvs (806, E2 and NEC). All three types of CAR-T cells demonstrated significant tumor-eliminating capability against NF1/SWN tumor cell lines, with 806 CAR-T cells showing the highest efficacy. Considering the immunosuppressive TME, we knocked out TGFBR2 and/or PDCD1 in 806 CAR-T cells using CRISPR/Cas9. Their anti-tumor efficacy was further evaluated using a 3D tumor spheroid model, and the gene-edited 806 CAR-T cells exhibited superior anti-tumor efficacy. In conclusion, we identified HER1 as a target for CAR-T cell therapy in NF1/SWN-related nerve sheath tumors, and developed anti-HER1 CAR-T cells that effectively eliminated NF1/SWN tumor cells, providing a promising therapeutic strategy for patients with these conditions."

Advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, such as whole exome sequencing (WES) and clinical exome sequencing (CES), have transformed the diagnostic landscape by enabling comprehensive genetic analysis. This study aimed to investigate the molecular spectrum and clinical relevance of genetic findings in 43 patients diagnosed with genodermatoses. Demographic, clinical, and molecular data were collected, and genetic testing was performed using the MGI-Seq platform. Variants were analyzed for pathogenicity, zygosity, and novelty. Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (27.9%) and Epidermolysis Bullosa (23.2%) were the most common diagnoses, followed by Ichthyosis (16.2%) and Oculocutaneous Albinism (13.9%). Less frequent conditions included Ectodermal Dysplasia (6.9%) and single cases of Palmoplantar Keratoderma, PTEN Hamartoma Syndrome, Rothmund-Thomson Syndrome, Xeroderma Pigmentosum, and Megaconial Congenital Muscular Dystrophy (each 2.3%). Molecular findings underscored the genetic complexity of genodermatoses, with 42 distinct variants identified across 19 genes. Of these, 13 variants (31%) were novel, expanding the known molecular spectrum. The novel variants were detected in genes including NF1, COL7A1, ITGB4, COL17A1, NIPAL4, ALOX12B, KRT10, ST14, OCA2, and PTEN, highlighting the diagnostic value of comprehensive genetic analysis. The mean age at diagnosis varied significantly among conditions, reflecting the diagnostic challenges and clinical variability of genodermatoses. This study emphasizes the critical role of WES and CES in diagnosing genodermatoses and understanding their molecular basis, which enhances diagnostic accuracy and supports personalized management strategies."

    "abstract": "Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) is a soft tissue sarcoma commonly associated with the tumor-predisposition disorder neurofibromatosis 1. The extracellular matrix collagens contribute to many fibrotic tumors; however, the role of collagen signaling in MPNST was unclear. This study investigated the effects of blocking the interaction between collagens and their receptors in MPNST. We first analyzed the expressions of collagen family proteins in MPNSTs and found an overall increase compared to neurofibroma. Treatment of DDR1-IN-1, a small molecule inhibitor for the collagen receptor discoidin domain receptor, induced a robust MPNST cell death, highlighting the dependence of MPNST survival on collagen signaling. DDR1-IN-1 induced MPNST cell death by activating autophagy and necroptosis signaling. Treatment of necroptosis inhibitors necrostatin-1 or necrosulfonamide reduced the numbers of DDR1-IN-1-induced necrotic cells and autolysosomes, suggesting that the autophagic process depends on necroptosis activation. Combinations of DDR1-IN-1 with other anti-MPNST agents revealed synergistic activities against MPNST. In summary, this study discovered a critical MPNST death signaling induced by the small molecule DDR1-IN-1, which might shed light on future MPNST therapeutic strategies."

Research suggests that neurodivergent processes in both conditions begin in the first year, altering infant behaviour and how parents respond, over time reducing social-communicative opportunities for social brain development. This study aimed to investigate parent-infant interactions in both groups relative to typically developing infants (TD) at 10 and 14 months. We hypothesised that the infants with NF1 and infants at elevated likelihood of ADHD (EL-ADHD) would show less attentiveness to their parent and less mutual parent-infant interaction relative to TD controls, that attentiveness-to-parent would be particularly low in infants with NF1, and that liveliness and negative affect would be higher in infants with EL-ADHD. Parents and their infants with NF1, EL-ADHD and TD were videotaped during free play interactions and coded using validated rating scales. The two non-TD groups differed in their interactive patterns from the TD group and each other in ways somewhat consistent with the early behaviours that characterise each group. The NF1 group showed relatively less mutual interactions than the EL-ADHD group, and less parental sensitive responsiveness and parental directiveness than the TD group, while EL-ADHD infants were livelier and showed less negative affect relative to the other groups. Most main effects persisted over time. While longer-term follow-up in larger samples is needed, our findings highlight how children with neurodevelopmental conditions that are not primarily characterised by social communication difficulties may nonetheless come to have distinct social experiences in the first year of life."

Adults with NF1 and 9 or more measurable cNFs were enrolled in this nonrandomized pilot trial at the National Cancer Institute and the University of Alabama at Birmingham, which spanned from August 26, 2017, to August 21, 2023. Participants received selumetinib for up to 24 cycles (1 cycle = 28 days) with restaging visits after every 4 cycles. Photography and volumetric measurements of cNFs using calipers were used to evaluate the number and volume of tumors. Participants completed the Skindex-29 Quality of Life assessment to quantify the effect of treatment on symptoms, functioning, emotions, itching, and pain. Among the 11 participants who enrolled, the median (range) age was 54 (28-75) years, and 6 were female. The median (IQR) best response across all participants and tumors was a -28.5% (-40.9% to -12.5%) decrease in cNF volume from baseline. Some participants showed a visible improvement in cNF burden while receiving treatment in standardized photographs. The median (range) duration of treatment was 9 cycles (1-24), with only 4 participants completing the full 24 cycles of treatment. Two of these participants continued treatment beyond the original 24 cycles due to perceived clinical benefit. All participants experienced at least 1 reversible drug-related adverse event (AE), with cutaneous AEs such as dry skin and rash being the most common. Two participants were removed from treatment due to concern for drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms. While the Skindex-29 assessment showed improvement in emotion scores after cycle 1, there were no other significant or durable changes in scores. In this nonrandomized pilot trial, selumetinib resulted in some decrease in cNF volume; however, there was no sustained improvement in patient-reported outcome measures. Study enrollment was incomplete, in part due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and highlights the challenges of treating patients with cNF with a drug that often leads to dermatologic AEs. Future larger studies using other measurement techniques, such as 3-dimensional photography, could help to yield results that are more generalizable to the phenotypically diverse NF1 population.

These complications can be painful and difficult to manage, often leading to the discontinuation of treatment. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of photodynamic therapy (PDT) as a novel treatment for MEKi-induced paronychia in a patient with NF1. <b>Methods:</b> We present a case report of an 18-year-old patient with NF1 who developed painful periungual granulomas on the toenails after 12 months of Selumetinib therapy. PDT was administered using methyl aminolevulinate (METVIX<sup>®</sup>) as the photosensitizing agent, followed by treatment with a red LED light source (630 nm, 37 J/cm<sup>2</sup> for 8 min and 30 s). The patient was followed up for two months post-treatment and then at two years. <b>Results:</b> After a single PDT session, the patient exhibited complete clinical remission of the periungual granulomas and associated pain. No recurrence of the lesions was noted during the two-year follow-up. The patient tolerated the procedure well, reporting only mild discomfort during treatment. <b>Conclusions:</b> PDT appears to be an effective, minimally invasive treatment for Selumetinib-induced paronychia and periungual granulomas. This case demonstrates that PDT can provide a complete resolution of symptoms with a single treatment session, offering an alternative to more invasive procedures. Further studies with larger cohorts are needed to establish PDT as a standard treatment option for this condition."

Some of these tumors are well known and have distinctive features that allow them to be identified by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These include sacrococcygeal teratoma (SCT), the most prevalent congenital tumor in children, often diagnosed prenatally and most frequently occurring in this anatomical location, and ovarian teratoma, which in its mature form is the most common ovarian neoplasm in children and adolescents. Additionally, rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), commonly found in the bladder in both genders and in the prostate in males, and Ewing sarcoma (ES), affecting the flat bones of the pelvis, are relatively common tumors. In this study, selected atypical pelvic tumors in children are presented. Most of them are tumors of the reproductive system, such as cervical cancer, small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the ovary, ES/primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET) of the ovary, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) of the ovaries and ovarian Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor (SLCT) with RMS due to DICER1 syndrome. Additionally, tumors originating from the nervous system, including neuroblastoma (NBL) and plexiform neurofibroma (pNF), associated and not associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), are discussed. Furthermore, Rosai-Dorfman disease involving the pelvic and inguinal lymph nodes is presented. By reviewing the literature and presenting our cases, we tried to find radiological features of individual tumors that would bring the radiologist closer to the correct diagnosis, ensuring the implementation of appropriate treatment. However, the MR images cannot be considered in isolation. Additional patient data, such as the clinical picture, comorbidities/syndromes, and laboratory test results, are necessary."

We identified multiple independent NF1 driver variants in histologically normal tissues, but not in 610 biopsies from two nonpredisposed children. We corroborated this finding using targeted duplex sequencing, including a further nine adults with the same syndrome. Overall, truncating NF1 mutations were under positive selection in normal tissues from individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1. We demonstrate that normal tissues in neurofibromatosis type 1 commonly harbor second hits in NF1, the extent and pattern of which may underpin the syndrome's cancer phenotype."

    "abstract": "Plexiform neurofibromas (PNFs) are benign tumors of the peripheral nervous system that affect approximately 30% of people with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Schwann cells (SCs), the tumor progenitor cells, respond to and use biomechanical signals like tissue stiffness and mechanical loads in their maintenance and repair functions in healthy tissues. PNFs are described as having altered biomechanics, and we hypothesize this plays a role in PNF development. As a first step in studying the role that altered biomechanics may play in the development of PNFs, we aimed to determine how PNF SCs alter in their response to various biomechanical signals as compared to healthy SCs. We examined the behavior of healthy and PNF SCs in three different tissue-mimicking biomechanical models. First, we examined their spreading behavior on extracellular matrix (ECM) protein-coated polyacrylamide hydrogels of varying stiffness in the healthy and pathological range. Second, we investigated their collective migration with respect to substrate stiffness and ECM protein-coating. Finally, we generated multicellular spheroid tissue models using healthy and PNF SCs and measured their mechanical properties as a function of spheroid size. We found that PNF SCs are differently sensitive to substrate stiffness in a physiological range compared to healthy SCs, lack sensitivity to ECM protein coating when collectively migrating, and lack sensitivity to environmental deficiencies in oxygen and nutrient supplies when in spheroid culture. We propose that PNF SC altered biomechanics likely play a role in tumor initiation and progression, and that further biomechanical-based investigations of NF1 tumor growth are needed."

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) represents a cluster of clinical features based on the National Institute of Health(NIH) diagnostic criteria. It is a multi-systemic disease with progressive features characterized by variable expression. NF1 is associated with an increased risk of malignancies including breast cancer. Presented was a 56 year old woman with a painless lump in the right breast in the past 15 months. Clinical evaluation revealed features of NF1 and an advanced right breast cancer. Histologic evaluation revealed an invasive ductal carcinoma and she was offered a right modified radical mastectomy. Due to clinical presentation with discrete lesions, NF1 may be diagnosed at presentation with malignancy. Clinicians are urged to be familiar with the subtle features of NF1 for early diagnosis that is largely clinical. Institution of early breast cancer surveillance in patients with NF1 is recommended for early diagnosis and improved outcomes."

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is associated with a high risk for cancer. Benign cutaneous neurofibromas of women with NF1 may increase in size and number during pregnancy. However, it is not known whether pregnancy affects the risk for cancer in NF1. We retrieved the pregnancies of women in the Finnish NF1 cohort and in a 10-fold control cohort from the Finnish Medical Birth Register. Cancers occurring during or after pregnancy were obtained from the Finnish Cancer Registry and summarized using standardized incidence ratio (SIR). The cancer incidence of nonNF1 mothers of individuals with NF1 was also estimated. Totals of 263 pregnancies in 136 women with NF1 and 3176 pregnancies in 1720 controls were observed. In the NF1 group, two cancers were identified during pregnancy and the year following the delivery (SIR 6.44, 95% CI 1.07-19.89). Among controls, the SIR was markedly lower (0.25, 95% CI 0.01-1.08). Within 1-10 years after pregnancy, the SIR of women with NF1 was 7.54 (95% CI 4.15-12.41). The SIR of women with NF1 aged 20-49 years, and without a known history of deliveries was 8.63 (95% CI 6.08-11.81). The nonNF1 mothers displayed a SIR of 0.81 (95% CI 0.66-1.00) after giving birth to a child with NF1. The pregnancy-related cancer incidence in women with NF1 is similar to women with NF1 aged 20-49 years overall, although notably higher than in the general population. Giving birth to a child with NF1 does not affect the risk for cancer in women without NF1."

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a complex genetic disorder often associated with neurocutaneous manifestations and cognitive impairments. This case report examines a nine-year-old child with NF1 who presented with multiple psychiatric comorbidities, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and developmental disorder of scholastic skills (DDSS). The child exhibited significant impairments in daily functioning and academic performance. Comprehensive assessments identified deficits in social communication and repetitive behaviors consistent with ASD, as well as symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity indicative of ADHD. Furthermore, the child struggled with reading, writing, and mathematics, consistent with DDSS. This report highlights the importance of diagnostic evaluations in children with NF1 to identify and address co-occurring psychiatric conditions. The association between NF1 and these comorbidities suggests a similar neurobiological basis, potentially involving disrupted neural pathways and altered brain development. Early intervention strategies, including behavioral therapies, educational support, and appropriate pharmacological treatments, were implemented to address the child's needs. This case emphasizes the importance of personalized approaches to improve developmental, cognitive, and psychological outcomes for children with NF1 and multiple psychiatric comorbidities. Further research is necessary to better understand the mechanisms driving these associations and to guide treatment strategies."

    "abstract": "Schwann cells are specific peripheral glial cells with remarkable plasticity following peripheral nerve injury. Injury responses stimulate c-Jun activation in Schwann cells, drive epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cellular phenotypic changes, and induce the generation of reprogrammed repair Schwann cells to orchestrate peripheral nerve regeneration process. Schwann cells and/or Schwann cell-derived molecules are commonly used as supporting cells and/or neurotrophic factors to construct Schwann cell-based tissue-engineered nerve grafts for repairing severe peripheral nerve injury with long defects. Transplantation of Schwann cells and/or Schwann cell-derived molecules also serves as a helpful approach for the treatment of other injured tissues, such as the spinal cord, skin, digit tip, and bone. Schwann cells are not only associated with tissue regeneration but also involved in tumorigenesis and tumor progression. Schwann cells are the major cellular component of neurofibromatosis type 1 and the sole cell type in neurofibromatosis type 2 and schwannomatosis. In addition, Schwann cells also function as an important player in the tumor microenvironment and aid in the growth and invasiveness of many other solid cancers. In the present review, we outline the physiological and pathological activities of Schwann cells and discuss the functional roles of Schwann cells in homeostasis, regeneration, and cancer."

    "abstract": "Patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) are at risk for developing various neoplasms. Since the early twentieth century, multiple cases of pituitary neuroendocrine tumors (PitNETs) occurring in this context have been published. Yet, the role of <i>NF1</i> (17q11.2) loss-of-function (LOF) variants in pituitary tumorigenesis remains unclear. We report the clinical and molecular characterization of a case of PitNET diagnosed in a patient with NF1. We also review the available data for and against a causal association between <i>NF1</i> defects and pituitary tumors. Our patient was recruited via an ongoing prospective study of individuals with neuroendocrine neoplasms. Genetic testing was carried out by means of targeted next generation sequencing (NGS) and Sanger sequencing in blood and tumor DNA, respectively. <i>NF1</i> expression was analyzed via quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) in blood and tumor cDNA. Similar cases were searched in the literature. A 54-year-old-man was incidentally diagnosed with a clinically non-functioning PitNET via brain imaging. He had a personal and family history of NF1 and carried the germline pathogenic variant <i>NF1</i> (NM_001042492.3): c.147C>A, p.Y49*. Via transsphenoidal surgery, a 16 mm lesion was resected, showing strong granular cytoplasmic immunoreactivity with patchy distribution for NF1 and preserved heterozygosity for the <i>NF1</i> defect. Additional NGS ruled out germline defects in PitNET-associated genes. By qPCR, <i>NF1</i> was significantly overexpressed in the tumor when compared with another NF-PitNET, but not when compared with a corticotropinoma. We reviewed twenty-three case reports of PitNETs occurring in patients with either clinical NF1 without genetic study, individuals with <i>NF1</i> germline variants with or without clinical NF1 or associated with somatic <i>NF1</i> defects. Predominance of GH-secreting and large PitNETs, with young-onset in around half of the cases, were noticed. Two individuals developed multiple endocrine neoplasia-like phenotypes but tested negative for other relevant genetic defects. Although the association of NF1 and PitNETs could be coincidental, the clinical characteristics of the reviewed cases differ from those of typical incidentalomas. <i>NF1</i> could drive pituitary tumorigenesis via haploinsufficiency, but this hypothesis requires further research. Additional clinical and molecular data from large cohorts of affected individuals should help clarify this question."

    "title": "Neurofibromin Deficiency Alters the Patterning and Prioritization of Motor Behaviors in a State-Dependent Manner.",
    "abstract": "Genetic disorders such as neurofibromatosis type 1 (Nf1) increase vulnerability to cognitive and behavioral disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Nf1 results from mutations in the neurofibromin gene that can reduce levels of the neurofibromin protein. While the mechanisms have yet to be fully elucidated, loss of Nf1 may alter neuronal circuit activity leading to changes in behavior and susceptibility to cognitive and behavioral comorbidities. Here we show that mutations decreasing Nf1 expression alter motor behaviors, impacting the patterning, prioritization, and behavioral state dependence in a <i>Drosophila</i> model of Nf1. Loss of Nf1 increased spontaneous grooming in male and female flies. This followed a nonlinear spatial pattern, with Nf1 deficiency increasing grooming of certain body parts differentially, including the abdomen, head, and wings. The increase in grooming could be overridden by hunger in foraging animals, demonstrating that the Nf1 effect is plastic and internal state dependent. Stimulus-evoked grooming patterns were altered as well, suggesting that hierarchical recruitment of grooming command circuits was altered. Yet loss of Nf1 in sensory neurons and/or grooming command neurons did not alter grooming frequency, suggesting that Nf1 affects grooming via higher-order circuit alterations. Changes in grooming coincided with alterations in walking. Flies lacking Nf1 walked with increased forward velocity on a spherical treadmill, yet there was no detectable change in leg kinematics or gait. These results demonstrate that loss of Nf1 alters the patterning and prioritization of repetitive behaviors, in a state-dependent manner, without affecting low-level motor functions."

We report the case of a 49-year-old gentleman with atlantoaxial instability due to NF-1 who presented with quadriparesis and was managed by reduction with skull traction followed by C1-C2 Goel-Harms fixation. In the present case, there was substantial bleeding and significant vertebral dysplasia, which makes the case distinctly unique. Skull traction and C1-C2 Goel-Harms fixation with fusion should be considered for patients with NF-1 complicated by atlantoaxial instability."

We used Nf1<sup>+/-</sup> mice and WT littermates and performed retinal structural analysis by optical coherence tomography (OCT), and functional assessment by electrophysiological recordings. We then performed behavioral visual tests using optomotor response (OMR) and sensitivity to visual stimulus familiarity. From the structural analysis, we found increased thickness for ganglion cell layer-inner plexiform layer (GCL-IPL) and outer nuclear layer (ONL) in male Nf1<sup>+/-</sup> mice compared with WT littermates. Regarding retinal electrophysiology, female Nf1<sup>+/-</sup> mice exhibited increased amplitudes for the second oscillatory potential (OP2) compared with WT littermates. Nevertheless, both Nf1<sup>+/-</sup> and WT mice presented normal visual acuity as measured by OMR and were able to exhibit regular visual stimulus familiarity responses. While structural sex-dependent changes are in line with previous results for brain anatomic measures, the subtle sex-dependent changes in oscillatory activity may relate to GABAergic neurotransmission changes found in NF1. Overall, these structural and functional changes do not seem to translate into visual behavioral alterations."

    "abstract": "<b><i>Background:</i></b> Neurofibromatosis is an autosomal dominant genetic disease caused by the abnormal development of neural crests due to genetic defects and is difficult to treat. Patients have a characteristic phenotype with neurofibromas as the main features in different forms, which are accompanied by multisystem involvement. The clinical symptoms of this disease vary greatly, making the treatment more difficult. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> Preimplantation genetic testing (PGT) is a useful technique to prevent chromosomal aneuploidies and other genetic disorders in origin. PGT for monogenic diseases (PGT-M) is now widely used as an effective strategy to screen embryos for monogenic or chromosomal diseases before implantation. In this study, PGT-M was performed in a family history of hereditary with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) to prevent the offspring from inheriting disease-causing gene variant from their parents. Trio-based whole-exome sequencing was used to identify potential pathogenic variants associated with NF1. Blastocyst biopsy was performed on embryos obtained by intracytoplasmic sperm injection. Single-cell amplification of biopsied cells was performed for targeted next-generation sequencing. Single nucleotide polymorphism markers on both sides of <i>NF1</i> were selected to identify disease-carrying haplotypes in each embryo. <b><i>Results:</i></b> A novel heterozygotic frameshift pathogenic variant, c.2033_2034delinsA(p.P678Qfs*10), was identified in the <i>NF1</i> gene in the proband. A total of five blastocysts were biopsied, and the PGT results showed that only one blastocyst was unaffected and was euploid, and the remaining four blastocysts were all carrying paternal pathogenic variants. The only one normal blastocyst was transferred in a frozen-thawed embryo transfer cycle, and a live singleton pregnancy was successfully achieved. At 18 weeks, the amniocentesis test revealed normal karyotype, and the variant carried by the proband was not detected. At 40 weeks, the proband's wife successfully delivered a healthy baby naturally. <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> PGT is an effective method to detect chromosome copy number variation and gene variant sites in embryos, and it provides suggestions for possible innovations to block the transmission of single-gene genetic diseases to offspring, thereby preventing the occurrence of birth defects."

However, there is limited evidence regarding how the EQ-5D-Y perform in patients with rare diseases in the country. Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a rare disease that affects the growth and development of underage patients. This study aimed to examine the performance of EQ-5D-Y proxy version among underage NF1 patients in China. Data from a nationwide cross-sectional survey from Nov 2022 to Jan 2023 was used. A total of 154 caregivers for underage NF1 patients who completed the EQ-5D-Y proxy version, PedsQL 4.0 Generic Core Scales (PedsQL GCS) proxy version, and Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI-22) were included. The performance of the EQ-5D-Y was assessed by response pattern (ceiling and floor effects), convergent validity against the PedsQL GCS, known-groups validity, and Shannon (H') and Shannon evenness (J') indices. Data from 154 caregivers were analyzed. The mean age of caregivers was 38.23 (6.02) years, and 78.57% of them were mothers of NF1 patients. The mean age of NF1 patients was 8.38 (3.34) years, with 51.30% being females. The ceiling effect of EQ-5D-Y was 30.52%, and floor effect was 0%. Moderate to strong correlations were found between EQ-5D-Y and PedsQL GCS dimensions that share similar constructs (rho - 0.42 to -0.60, all p values < 0.001). The hypotheses of known-groups defined by different PedsQL GCS and ZBI scores were validated. The EQ-5D-Y exhibited the strongest informativity and discriminatory power of the \"feeling worried, sad or unhappy\" dimension and weakest for the \"mobility\" dimension (H'<sub>(mobility)</sub> = 0.60, J'<sub>(mobility)</sub> = 0.38; H'<sub>(feeling worried, sad or unhappy)</sub> = 1.23, J'<sub>(feeling worried, sad or unhappy)</sub> = 0.78). EQ-5D-Y is acceptable for measuring HRQL of underage NF1 patients in China. More evidence for using EQ-5D-Y in rare diseases is awaited."

Using a quasiprospective repeated-measures A followed by B:B followed by A crossover design, participants (N = 36), children with neurofibromatosis type 1, autism, and from the general population underwent face-to-face and telehealth testing using a trained parent facilitator. Measures included Full Scale IQ from the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Australian and New Zealand Standardised Fifth Edition; Word Reading, Spelling, and Numerical Operations subtests from the Wechsler Individual Achievement Test-Australian and New Zealand Standardised Third Edition; Comprehension of Instructions; Score!; Formulated Sentences; Rey Complex Figure Test; and the California Verbal Learning Test. Children, parents, and clinicians also completed a feasibility and acceptability survey. Predominantly high agreement between face-to-face and telehealth intelligence and academic scores were identified from intraclass correlation coefficients, independent of age and retest period. Intraclass correlation coefficient values were excellent for Full Scale IQ, Spelling and Numerical Operations (0.91-0.95), good for all intelligence index scores, reading, verbal learning and expressive language (range, 0.76-0.89), moderate for verbal recall, comprehension of instructions and copy accuracy (range, 0.63-0.74), and poor for sustained attention (0.23). Reliable change indices revealed stable test scores across most neuropsychological tests. Telehealth-delivered neuropsychology testing was satisfactory according to children, parents, and clinicians, although in-person was slightly preferred over telehealth.

Intriguingly, an incidental finding of an adrenal nodule prompted investigation, leading to the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma. Surgical intervention confirmed the presence of pheochromocytoma and parathyroid carcinoma. Genetic analysis corroborated NF1 with a pathogenic variant in the NF1 gene. The patient's clinical manifestations, coupled with the presence of café-au-lait spots and axillary freckles, supported the diagnosis of NF1. This case not only highlights the challenging diagnostic landscape of NF1 but also underscores the rarity of the co-occurrence of parathyroid carcinoma and pheochromocytoma within the context of NF1. It emphasizes the necessity for heightened clinical suspicion and comprehensive evaluation in patients with NF1, particularly in those presenting with endocrine abnormalities. Further investigation into the underlying mechanisms linking these conditions is warranted to elucidate their pathophysiological interplay and inform optimal therapeutic strategies for affected individuals. This case underscores the importance of multidisciplinary collaboration in the management of complex NF1-associated manifestations, with an emphasis on early detection and tailored intervention to optimize patient outcomes. Rare but real: multiple endocrine tumors can coexist in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), not only pheochromocytoma. Early detection matters: prompt diagnosis and a multidisciplinary approach are crucial for managing NF1 patients presenting with symptoms suggestive of these rare endocrine tumors. Genetic insights guide care: genetic testing aids in confirming NF1 and guiding treatment decisions, emphasizing the role of genetics in personalized medicine for NF1 patients."

Due to its infrequency and aggressive behavior, no standardized treatment approach has been established. This report presents a case of primary MPNST of the cauda equina, accompanied by a comprehensive literature review, aiming to elucidate the management strategies and prognosis of this uncommon yet highly malignant tumor. A 62-year-old male was diagnosed with primary intradural MPNST and underwent gross total resection (GTR) with laminectomy along with adjunctive high-energy radiotherapy. Concurrently, we analyze existing literature concerning intradural MPNSTs. Surgical resection remains the mainstay of MPNST management, although its efficacy is limited by high recurrence rates. Despite aggressive treatment modalities, including radiotherapy and chemotherapy, primary intradural MPNSTs exhibit a propensity for leptomeningeal and systemic dissemination, contributing to a dismal overall prognosis. Notably, outcomes appear to be graver compared to MPNSTs in other anatomical locations. Primary intradural MPNSTs represent a rare and formidable clinical challenge characterized by poor prognostic outcomes. While surgical excision supplemented by adjuvant radiotherapy may offer some benefit, the need for effective targeted therapies associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) needs to be studied more to delineate optimal treatment strategies and improve patient outcomes."

The condition mainly presents in childhood, with cancers primarily affecting the hematological, brain, and gastrointestinal systems, along with cutaneous features typical of neurofibromatosis type 1. This scoping review aims to explore the clinical characteristics of CMMRD. A systematic search of medical databases resulted in the inclusion of 127 articles. PMS2 is the most affected gene, followed by MSH6, MLH1, and MSH2. Blood and brain malignancies occur in early childhood for all genetic variants, with the age of onset progressively decreasing from PMS2 to MSH6, to MLH1 and MSH2. Gastrointestinal tumors typically present in late adolescence in individuals with PMS2 variants, at slightly younger ages in those with MSH6 variants, and are rarely reported in MLH1 and MSH2 cases. Patients with CMMRD present with café-au-lait macules that are fewer in number and larger than in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1. Additional dermatological findings include hypopigmented patches and intertriginous freckling. PMS2 and MSH6 pathogenic variants are linked to the broadest spectrum of cutaneous manifestations, including vascular tumors, various nevi, and pilomatricomas. Despite its rarity and diverse clinical manifestations, advancements in diagnostic criteria, genetic testing, and surveillance protocols have significantly improved survival rates and cancer management in CMMRD patients."

Two patients over 40 years of age were treated for vascular system disorders, and 1 patient for a brain tumor. All survivors were ambulators except 1 case of non-ambulator due to neoplastic destruction of the hip joint. The working status was light work in 13 patients, desk work in 7, unemployed in 4, students in 8. Four patients were married. SRS-22 and ODI at the last follow-up in the NF-1 group and AIS group were compared. There were no significant differences in SRS-22 Pain, Mental Health, Satisfaction, and ODI, but SRS-22 Function and Self-image were significantly lower in the NF-1 group. At an average follow-up of 14.8 years after surgery, 5 of 38 patients had died, 29 patients (76.3%) were able to lead a social life. However, HR-QOL was lower than that of AIS. Patients undergoing NF-1 scoliosis surgery require careful long-term follow-up, taking into account the possibility of reoperation due to osteolysis, malignant changes in the tumor, and vascular problems due to vascular fragility."

    "title": "Examining Demographic and Clinical Traits in Neurofibromatosis Type 1 Patients: Insights into Vitamin D Levels and Connections with Nevus Anemicus and Neurofibromas.",
    "abstract": "This article aims to examine the demographic and clinical traits of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) patients, particularly focusing on the potential links between vitamin D levels, BMI, and dermatological features. A retrospective review of medical records involving 128 patients diagnosed with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) over a 3-year-period was conducted. The analysis emphasized investigating the demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients while evaluating key parameters. Nevus anemicus was present in 32.8% of NF1 patients, and a significant association was found between nevus anemicus and low vitamin D levels (<i>P</i> = 0.001). We also observed a notable correlation between low vitamin D levels and an increased likelihood of neurofibromas (<i>P</i> < 0.001). Additionally, there appears to be an inverse relationship between serum vitamin D levels and the number of neurofibromas. Our study suggests a correlation between lower vitamin D levels and key dermatological characteristics in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) individuals. Specifically, we observed associations with nevus anemicus prevalence and increased neurofibromas. This observation enriches NF1's understanding, offering practical implications for patient management by emphasizing the importance of monitoring and addressing vitamin D levels."

    "title": "Adeno-associated viral vector targeted evolution for neurofibromatosis gene delivery.",
    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an inherited genetic disease resulting from pathogenic mutations in NF1 that drive tumor formation along peripheral nerves, leading to many functional consequences. Tumor removal or treatment often results in regrowth and/or nerve damage. Addressing NF1 pathogenic variations at the cellular level through gene therapy holds great potential for long-term treatment of patients with NF1. Adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) are broadly used gene delivery vehicles for gene therapies because of their low pathogenicity, ability to transduce nondividing cells, and potential for long-term gene expression. This article explores the landscape of AAV-mediated gene delivery strategies for NF1, discusses the challenges of efficient delivery to relevant cell types, and highlights the progress in vector design strategies."

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1, formerly Recklinghausen's disease) is a genetic tumor predisposition syndrome in which the mutation of a tumor suppressor gene (neurofibromin) leads to the development of mostly benign neurofibromas of the skin and the central and peripheral nervous systems and malformations or tumors of other organ systems. Patients with NF1 should receive lifelong interdisciplinary care in specialized centers and important treatment decisions should be made by a regularly meeting interdisciplinary panel of experts. Plastic surgery plays an important role in the multidisciplinary management of all clinical forms of NF1-associated peripheral nerve sheath tumors, from cutaneous and subcutaneous to deep nodular and diffuse plexiform neurofibromas. Each patient requires individualized surgical planning, whereby the timing and extent of surgery are determined by the accompanying symptoms, functional and esthetic limitations, disease progression and potential malignant transformation. As any region of the body can be affected, the esthetic and reconstructive procedures required include a wide range of interventions, such as eyelid surgery and facial restoration to breast shaping and nerve reconstruction or motor replacement surgery. A timely surgical intervention can have a profoundly positive effect on the course of the disease and the quality of life of those affected and, in the case of transformation into a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST), can even be lifesaving."

    "abstract": "The intestinal microbiota regulates normal brain physiology and the pathogenesis of several neurological disorders. While prior studies suggested that this regulation operates through immune cells, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Leveraging two well characterized murine models of low-grade glioma (LGG) occurring in the setting of the neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) cancer predisposition syndrome, we sought to determine the impact of the gut microbiome on optic glioma progression. Nf1-mutant mice genetically engineered to develop optic pathway gliomas (Nf1OPG mice) by 3 months of age were reared under germ-free (GF) conditions, treated with specific cocktails of antibiotics, or given fecal matter transplants (FMTs). Intestinal microbial species were identified by 16S genotyping. Neutralizing TGFβ antibodies were delivered systemically, while in vitro experiments used isolated murine microglia and T cells. Single cell RNA sequencing analysis was performed using established methods. Nf1 OPG mice raised in a GF environment or postnatally treated with vancomycin did not harbor optic gliomas or exhibit OPG-induced retinal nerve fiber layer thinning, which was reversed following conventionally raised mouse FMT or colonization with Bacteroides species. Moreover, this intestinal microbiota-regulated gliomagenesis was mediated by circulating TGFβ, such that systemic TGFβ neutralization reduced Nf1-OPG growth. TGFβ was shown to act on tumor-associated monocytes to induce Ccl3 expression and recruit CD8+ T cells necessary for glioma growth. Taken together, these findings establish, for the first time, a mechanistic relationship between Bacteroides in the intestinal microbiome and NF1-LGG pathobiology, suggesting both future predictive risk assessment strategies and therapeutic opportunities."

    "abstract": "Deep-learning models have shown promise in differentiating between benign and malignant lesions. Previous studies have primarily focused on specific anatomical regions, overlooking tumors occurring throughout the body with highly heterogeneous whole-body backgrounds. Using neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) as an example, this study developed highly accurate MRI-based deep-learning models for the early automated screening of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) against complex whole-body background. In a Chinese seven-center cohort, data from 347 subjects were analyzed. Our one-step model incorporated normal tissue/organ labels to provide contextual information, offering a solution for tumors with complex backgrounds. To address privacy concerns, we utilized a lightweight deep neural network suitable for hospital deployment. The final model achieved an accuracy of 85.71% for MPNST diagnosis in the validation cohort and 84.75% accuracy in the independent test set, outperforming another classic two-step model. This success suggests potential for AI models in screening other whole-body primary/metastatic tumors."

So far, hepatoblastoma in a patient with NF1 has been reported twice in the literature. A liver mass was discovered in a 11 year-old girl with NF1 leading to a diagnosis of epithelial hepatoblastoma with pulmonary metastasis. Targeted analysis on blood revealed a germline NF1 missense variant. Exome sequencing, RNA-seq and methylation analyses performed on tumoral and metastatic samples confirmed the germline NF1 variant and showed classical driver variants for hepatoblastoma. We present here the third case of hepatoblastoma in a patient with NF1 and discuss the possible link between this rare tumor and this neurocutaneous genetic condition."

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis is a genetic disorder arising de novo or with an autosomal dominant transmission that typically presents either at birth or in early childhood, manifesting through distinctive clinical features such as multiple café-au-lait spots, benign tumors in the skin, bone enlargement, and deformities. This literature review aims to resume the spectrum of maternal and fetal complications encountered in pregnant women with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Thorough research was conducted on databases such as Web of Science, PubMed, Science Direct, Google Scholar, and Wiley Online Library. This review includes 48 case reports, original studies, and reviews on NF1 in pregnancy. The research on the interlink between NF1 and fertility and its influence on human-assisted reproduction techniques is limited. Preimplantation testing (by in vitro fertilization) and prenatal diagnosis (by chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis) are available to detect affected fetuses. However, genotype-phenotype correlation is difficult to predict. Preconceptional planning and targeted investigations are crucial in understanding the extent of maternal disease. Although in some cases lesions can evolve rapidly during pregnancy, most pregnancies and births in NF1 go well with careful planning. There is a higher incidence of pheochromocytomas and pre-eclampsia, vascular rupture, and cardio-respiratory issues. Anesthesia at birth is a challenge in most cases, and before offering spinal anesthesia, imaging tests should be performed to characterize spinal lesions. General anesthesia may also be challenging when the disease affects the face, neck, upper spine, or airways. Birth-related difficulties may arise because of large neurofibromas located at the level of skin incision or birth canal; uterine atony may be expected if there are uterine lesions. Some complications can develop in postpartum, and affected women should be carefully followed even after pregnancy. Fetal risks include preterm birth (spontaneous or iatrogenic), growth restriction and developmental issues, birth complications, cardiovascular risk, and fetal/neonatal demise. Pregnancies in women with NF1 should be regarded as high-risk and followed in a multidisciplinary fashion. Careful assessment of lesions is of utmost importance before and during pregnancy for anticipating potential maternal risks and before birth to plan anesthesia and delivery."

    "title": "Efficacy and Risks of Posterior Vertebral Column Resection in the Treatment of Severe Pediatric Spinal Deformities: A Case Series.",
    "abstract": "<b>Background/Objectives</b>: Surgery for adolescent idiopathic deformities is often aimed at improving aesthetic appearance, striving for the best possible correction. However, severe and rigid scoliotic curves not only present aesthetic issues but can also compromise cardiopulmonary health and cause early neurological impairment due to spinal cord compression, posing significant risks of morbidity and mortality if untreated. Conservative treatments are ineffective for severe curves, defined by scoliotic angles over 70° and flexibility below 30% on lateral bending X-rays. Treatment often requires invasive interventions, such as osteotomies and vertebral resections. In particular, posterior vertebral column resection (PVCR) has shown effectiveness in realigning vertebral structures in complex cases. This study describes the efficacy and risks of PVCR through a series of cases treated at our institution. <b>Methods</b>: This case series was conducted at the Rizzoli Orthopedic Institute in Bologna, involving eight pediatric patients with severe, rigid spinal deformities, operated upon between 2018 and 2023. The underlying pathologies included idiopathic kyphoscoliosis, neurofibromatosis type 1, Pott's disease, and other congenital anomalies. Preoperative assessment included standard radiographs, magnetic resonance imaging, and computed tomography. During PVCR, motor and sensory evoked potentials were monitored to minimize neurological injury risk. Postoperative management included blood transfusions, antibiotic support, and early physiotherapy. <b>Results</b>: PVCR resulted in an average reduction in the Cobb angle from 86.3° preoperatively to 22.4° postoperatively, with a mean correction of 64%. The mean duration of the procedures was 337.4 min. Three patients had an uneventful postoperative course, while five developed complications, including infections and temporary neurological deficits, which were successfully managed. One patient developed an epidural hemorrhage that required emergency surgery for hematoma evacuation, with partial recovery. This study demonstrates the potential of PVCR for correcting rigid spinal deformities, highlighting the importance of postoperative management to minimize the associated risks. <b>Conclusions</b>: Posterior vertebral resection techniques offer significant promise in the correction of pediatric spinal deformities. Although ours is a small case series, it can provide important data for such treatment. Long-term monitoring is needed to fully understand the impact of these procedures and to further refine surgical techniques."

    "abstract": "Rupture of the thyrocervical trunk aneurysm into the thoracic cavity does not occur very often. It is an urgent condition due to hemorrhagic shock by massive hemothorax with potentially fatal consequences. Pregnancy and puerperium are additional risk factors for a rupture of the thyrocervical trunk aneurysm in patients with neurofibromatosis and aneurysms. This is the first case of thyrocervical trunk aneurysm rupture after a Cesarean section in a patient with neurofibromatosis type I noted down in the literature. The patient, a 33-year-old woman with neurofibromatosis type I, three days after an already performed Cesarean section had acute pain in the left area of the neck, swelling, and a hematoma that progressed rapidly to respiratory distress, hemothorax, and hemorrhagic shock. Emergency endotracheal intubation was performed for airway control. Urgent computer tomography angiography procedure showed extracranial artery, thyrocervical trunk aneurysm rupture, and vertebral aneurysm without rupture. The patient was urgently and successfully treated by endovascular coil embolization of a ruptured thyrocervical trunk aneurysm and subsequently thoracic drainage for massive hemothorax. Postoperatively, her left neck pain decreased, after which she had no further neurologic deficits. The patient was discharged 10 days later. Thyrocervical trunk aneurysm rupture is a rare condition with a potential outcome of death which requires urgent intervention. Endovascular coil embolization is a minimally invasive, safe, and efficient treatment for patients with rupture of thyrocervical trunk aneurysm and following comorbidities."

    "abstract": "Oral therapeutic options for plexiform neurofibromas (PNs) in individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) are receiving attention in clinical research. The MEK inhibitor (MEKi) Selumetinib is FDA-approved in children ages 2+ years with inoperable PNs, and shows activity in adults. Prolonged therapy with selumetinib is necessary to maintain tumor reduction. Therefore, investigating long-term adherence is vital to understand patterns of adherence over time and its impact on clinical outcomes. Mixed methods research offers rich information about adherence that can inform future intervention trials, and can assist practitioners in addressing medication adherence concerns. This mixed-method pilot study is the first examination of the feasibility of a technology-based adherence assessment method, the medication events monitoring system (MEMS<sup>TM</sup>), among individuals with NF1-PN. Adherence was monitored in a small sample of patients (N = 12; mean age = 34.36 years; 58% male) with NF1 and PN across eighteen 28-day treatment cycles. Qualitative data were obtained from individual interviews using inductive and deductive techniques for thematic analysis. The predetermined criterion was met, suggesting that using MEMS<sup>TM</sup> is feasible despite some challenges with the caps. Depression and overall stress were significantly related to reduced adherence, although these results should be considered hypothesis-generating. Barriers to medication adherence included forgetting and the timing of doses related to eating. Facilitators included consistency, reminders, and social support. This study highlights patient characteristics that may be related to increased risk for nonadherence, as well as challenges with electronic pill caps that should be considered in future clinical trials for NF1-related PN. Results can inform future adherence interventions for adults with NF1 and PNs. Future research with larger samples is needed to fully explore factors related to long-term medication adherence among individuals with NF1."

    "abstract": "Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) is a rare but aggressive soft-tissue sarcoma characterized by poor response to therapy. The primary treatment remains surgical resection with negative margins. Nonetheless, in the setting of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), the five-year survival rate is at 20-50%, with recurrence occurring in up to 50% of individuals. For patients with metastatic and unresectable disease, current treatment options include cytotoxic chemotherapy, which offers minimal benefit, and most patients die within five years of diagnosis. Despite advances in targeted therapy focusing on inhibiting Ras signaling and its downstream effectors, clinical trials report minimal clinical benefit, highlighting the need to explore alternative pathways in MPNST pathogenesis. Here, we discuss the role of the E3 ubiquitin ligase, UBR5, in cancer progression and immune modulation across various malignancies, including breast, lung, and ovarian cancer. We focus on mechanisms by which UBR5 contributes to tumorigenesis, focusing on its influence on tumor microenvironment and immune modulation. Additionally, we explore UBR5's roles in normal tissue function, DNA damage response, metastasis, and therapeutic resistance, illustrating its multifaceted contribution to cancer biology. We discuss evidence implicating UBR5 in immune evasion and highlight its potential as a therapeutic target to enhance the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy in MPNST, a tumor typically characterized by an immune cold microenvironment. We outline current immune-based strategies and challenges in MPNST management, ongoing efforts to shift the immune landscape in MPNST, and ultimately, we suggest that targeting UBR5 could be a novel strategy to potentiate ICB therapy-mediated anti-tumor immune response and clinical outcomes, particularly in MPNST patients with inoperable or metastatic disease."

Computed tomography (CT) scan revealed hemorrhagic ascites and a pseudoaneurysm of the sigmoid colon artery, which was suspected to be the source of bleeding. Emergency laparotomy confirmed extremely fragile vessels, requiring repeated surgeries for recurrent bleeding. The patient was diagnosed with NF-1 vasculopathy, a rare vascular complication of this autosomal dominant disorder. NF-1, which affects 1 in 3000-5000 individuals, is associated with reduced life expectancy due to malignancies and vascular diseases, including NF-1 vasculopathy. This condition involves structural vascular abnormalities and increased fragility affecting vessels of all sizes. Recognition of this fragility is critical during invasive procedures, such as interventional radiology or surgery, to reduce the risk of bleeding and ensure optimal management. This case highlights the importance of considering NF-1 vasculopathy in patients with abdominal bleeding and adopting tailored strategies to address its challenges."

We aimed to examine the developmental patterns of academic achievement in these children from childhood to adolescence and how these patterns differ across demographic and NF1-related disease factors. This cross-sectional study integrated data of 1512 children with NF1 (mean age, 11.2 years, SD, 3.62, range, 3-18, 46.5% female patients) from 8 institutions. Academic functioning was assessed with Woodcock-Johnson Tests of Achievement or the Wechsler Individual Achievement Test. Data were analyzed primarily using time-varying effect modeling. Participants' academic achievement was significantly lower than the normative means across ages, and the gap widened from middle childhood to midadolescence. Academic age trends varied across academic domains and demographic and disease factors. Male patients demonstrated larger deviations in math at midchildhood and in reading and writing between midchildhood and midadolescence. Children with lower parental education demonstrated larger deviations in math, reading, and writing between midchildhood and midadolescence. Children with familial NF1 demonstrated larger deviations in math at midchildhood and mid-to-late-adolescence, and in reading and writing between midchildhood and midadolescence. Academic difficulties in children with NF1 emerge early and worsen with age. The findings also highlight the variability within this population across demographic and disease factors. The age-specific estimates of academic functions can serve as the first NF1-specific academic norms, providing useful insights for future research and practice."

Four cases of HGAP were reviewed, along with relevant medical records. HGAP is an important consideration in the differential diagnosis of isocitrate dehydrogenase-wild-type gliomas and is more frequently encountered in adults. A handful of studies published following the entity's codification in the 2021 WHO Blue Book have refined our understanding of its clinical, histologic, and hallmark molecular characteristics. The most substantial updates include the description of 3 provisional subtypes, further characterization of an association with neurofibromatosis 1 syndrome, identification of new rare molecular alterations, and documentation of a unique case of possible transformation of pilocytic astrocytoma into HGAP. Clues to the diagnosis of HGAP include histologic infiltrating glioma with moderate pleomorphism, posterior fossa location, CDKN2A/B (cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 2A/B) deletion, MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) pathway alterations, ATRX (alpha thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked) loss, and association with neurofibromatosis 1 syndrome in some cases; these findings should prompt further molecular testing, including genome-wide DNA methylation analysis, which is currently essential for diagnosis."

We sought to compare the effect of different dimensionality reduction methods for comorbidity features extracted from electronic health records (EHRs) on the performance of ML models for predicting the development of various sub-phenotypes in children with Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). EHR-derived data from pediatric subjects with a confirmed clinical diagnosis of NF1 were used to create 10 unique comorbidities code-derived feature sets by incorporating dimensionality reduction techniques using raw International Classification of Diseases codes, Clinical Classifications Software Refined, and Phecode mapping schemes. We compared the performance of logistic regression, XGBoost, and random forest models utilizing each feature set. XGBoost-based predictive models were most successful at predicting NF1 sub-phenotypes. Overall, features based on domain knowledge-informed mapping schema performed better than unsupervised feature reduction methods. High-level features exhibited the worst performance across models and outcomes, suggesting excessive information loss with over-aggregation of features. Model performance is significantly impacted by dimensionality reduction techniques and varies by specific ML algorithm and outcome being predicted. Automated methods using existing knowledge and ontology databases can effectively aggregate features extracted from EHRs. Dimensionality reduction through feature aggregation can enhance the performance of ML models, particularly in high-dimensional datasets with small sample sizes, commonly found in EHRs health applications. However, if not carefully optimized, it can lead to information loss and data oversimplification, potentially adversely affecting model performance."

This hinders the overall attendance of their psychosocial needs and has a major impact on their quality of life. Thus, this systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to synthesize existing findings on the degree to which individuals with NF1 experience internalizing and externalizing symptoms, compared with the unaffected population, and explore moderators of the group disparities. Scopus, PsycINFO, Web of Science, PubMed, and ProQuest were searched from inception to March 26th, 2024, which identified 59 eligible studies (N of NF1 = 3182, mean ages 2.38 to 46.4 years). Hedges' g was calculated for differences in internalizing and externalizing symptoms between the NF1 group and the unaffected controls. Study effect sizes were pooled using robust variance estimation and random-effects models. Moderators of group differences were tested using meta-regression. Random-effects meta-analyses indicated that compared with unaffected controls, individuals with NF1 showed more severe depressive (k = 21; g = 0.43; 95% CI [0.21, 0.65]), anxiety (k = 24; g = 0.27; 95% CI [0.01, 0.54]), somatic (k = 27; g = 0.56; 95% CI [0.30, 0.83]), total internalizing (k = 75; g = 0.50; 95% CI [0.33, 0.67]), aggression (k = 33; g = 0.33; 95% CI [0.08, 0.58]), delinquency, (k = 37; g = 0.43; 95% CI [0.26, 0.60]), and total externalizing symptoms (k = 47; g = 0.24; 95% CI [0.13, 0.35]). Studies that included more participants with NF1 who had ADHD or a lower verbal IQ reported greater group disparities in total internalizing symptoms or aggression. Findings highlight the importance of promptly recognizing internalizing and externalizing symptoms in individuals with NF1 for timely interventions.

    "abstract": "Neurofibromin (NF1), a Ras GTPase-activating protein (GAP), catalyzes Ras-mediated GTP hydrolysis and thereby negatively regulates the Ras/MAPK pathway. NF1 mutations can cause neurofibromatosis type 1 manifesting tumors, and neurodevelopmental disorders. Exactly how the missense mutations in the GAP-related domain of NF1 (NF1<sup>GRD</sup>) allosterically impact NF1 GAP to promote these distinct pathologies is unclear. Especially tantalizing is the question of how same-domain, same-residue NF1<sup>GRD</sup> variants exhibit distinct clinical phenotypes. Guided by clinical data, we take up this dilemma. We sampled the conformational ensembles of NF1<sup>GRD</sup> in complex with GTP-bound K-Ras4B by performing molecular dynamics simulations. Our results show that mutations in NF1<sup>GRD</sup> retain the active conformation of K-Ras4B but with biased propensities of the catalytically competent populations of K-Ras4B-NF1<sup>GRD</sup> complex. In agreement with clinical depiction and experimental tagging, compared to the wild type, NF1<sup>GRD</sup> E1356A and E1356V mutants effectively act through loss-of-function and gain-of-function mechanisms, leading to neurofibromatosis and developmental disorders, respectively. Allosteric modulation of NF1<sup>GRD</sup> GAP activity through biasing the conformational ensembles in the different states is further demonstrated by the diminished GAP activity by NF1<sup>GRD</sup> isoform 2, further manifesting propensities of conformational ensembles as powerful predictors of protein function. Taken together, our work identifies a NF1<sup>GRD</sup> hotspot that could allosterically tune GAP function, suggests targeting Ras oncogenic mutations by restoring NF1 catalytic activity, and offers a molecular mechanism for NF1 phenotypes determined by their distinct conformational propensities."

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a rare neurogenetic disorder with limited treatment options. Selumetinib, a MEK1/2 inhibitor, has emerged as a promising therapy for inoperable NF1-related plexiform neurofibromas. Our retrospective pharmacovigilance study utilized the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) to comprehensively evaluate Selumetinib's safety profile in real-world settings. Data from the third quarter of 2020 to the fourth quarter of 2023 were analyzed, identifying 498 adverse event reports with Selumetinib as the primary suspect drug. Statistical analysis revealed disproportionate signals for skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders, eye disorders, and various congenital, familial, and genetic disorders. The most common adverse events were elevated blood creatine phosphokinase, rash, and acneiform dermatitis. Notably, several adverse events, including rhabdomyolysis, were identified but not listed on the Selumetinib product label, based on a comparison with the FDA drug labeling. The study underscores the importance of early detection and management of adverse reactions associated with Selumetinib, particularly within the initial month of treatment. These findings provide valuable insights for clinicians and regulators to ensure the safe and effective use of Selumetinib in NF1 patients."

    "abstract": "Cytomegalovirus colitis most commonly affects immunocompromised patients, although it is a rare cause of gastrointestinal bleeding in immunocompetent patients. Older age, chronic disease, and critical illness are also important risk factors and may lead providers to consider the diagnosis in otherwise immunocompetent patients. Endoscopic presentation is variable and does not significantly influence outcomes. Although most immunocompetent, noncritically ill patients improve with or without antiviral treatment, mortality rates are as high as 71.4% in critically ill patients. Such mortality rates necessitate that intensive care providers remain wary of the diagnosis in any patient presenting with gastrointestinal bleeding. We present a rare case of cytomegalovirus colitis masquerading as a recurrent colonic mass in a patient with neurofibromatosis type 1."

    "title": "Selumetinib for children with neurofibromatosis type 1 and plexiform neurofibromas that can't be removed by surgery, and impact on how the condition affects caregivers: a plain language summary.",
    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (also called NF1) is a rare genetic condition. It causes a range of symptoms that develop from childhood onwards and worsen over time. Some children with NF1 develop non-cancerous nerve tumors called plexiform neurofibromas. Plexiform neurofibromas can grow large and compress nearby tissues. This can cause severe pain, reduced movement, vision and hearing loss, and other medical problems. Some children can have plexiform neurofibromas removed surgically. Most children have tumors that cannot be removed by surgery (known as inoperable tumors). Children with inoperable plexiform neurofibromas can receive a medicine called selumetinib. This plain language summary includes important findings from two selumetinib studies in children with NF1 and inoperable plexiform neurofibromas: The SPRINT selumetinib studies are part of a clinical study program that looked at how well selumetinib works in treating children with symptomatic, inoperable plexiform neurofibromas. The SPRINT studies program included the first studies of this medicine done in children, called phase 1 and phase 2 studies. For the phase 2 study, some children had severe symptoms and some children did not. The group of children with severe symptoms is called group 1, and their results are included in this summary. The researchers monitored the participating children for up to 5 years in a long-term study to better understand how the treatment works over time. The NF1 caregivers experience study is a related study where caregivers shared their experiences of caring for children with NF1and plexiform neurofibromas. A total of 74 children took part in the SPRINT phase 1 and phase 2 (group 1) study. Their ages ranged from 3 to 18.5 years, and their average age was 10.3 years. After more than 4 years of treatment, around 70% of the children (52 out of 74) had smaller tumors. For most children, the responses lasted beyond 1 year. There was a significant and lasting reduction in the intensity of the children';s tumor pain, noticeable as early as 2 months after starting the treatment. After 12 months, children reported their pain dropped from an average score of 2.2 to 0.6 and stayed low at 0.58 over 4 years. There was also an improvement in how much their pain affected the children's ability to do daily tasks. Some children had side effects related to selumetinib, although these were generally manageable. Results from the NF1 caregivers experience study showed caregivers of children with plexiform neurofibromas face significant impacts in physical, psychological, economic, and social aspects. These effects often result in a loss of productivity and difficulties with daily activity. Children with NF1 who have symptomatic, inoperable plexiform neurofibromas can benefit from selumetinib treatment. Selumetinib is generally well-tolerated, but it is important to monitor side effects during treatment. Caring for a child with NF1 and symptomatic, inoperable plexiform neurofibromas has a significant impact on family members and others providing daily care. This highlights the importance of improving treatment and quality of life for both children with the condition and their caregivers."

    "abstract": "Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), though rare, are associated with neurofibromatosis (NF) type 1 and may cause significant gastrointestinal bleeding. A 42-year-old male with NF1 presented with severe hematochezia and underwent initial non-contrast CT, which was negative for abnormalities. Subsequent endoscopies and PillCam studies also revealed no clear bleeding source. Due to persistent bleeding and hemodynamic instability, a contrast-enhanced CT was eventually performed, revealing a hyper-enhancing mass in the proximal ileum. Emergent surgical exploration identified a 1.5-cm jejunal GIST, which was resected successfully, stabilizing the patient who was discharged without the need for adjuvant therapy. This case highlights the importance of early contrast-enhanced imaging in NF1 patients presenting with acute bleeding to facilitate timely diagnosis, reduce hospital resource utilization, and avoid unnecessary invasive procedures."

These growths are typically benign, especially in young children between the ages of one and six years, while the rarer malignant types are generally more aggressive and tend to appear in adults. Characteristically slow-growing, optic nerve gliomas are commonly located in the pre-chiasmal part of the optic nerve but can extend to post-chiasmal regions and into the brain if left untreated. We describe a case of a one-year-old boy who visited our ophthalmology clinic with symptoms of eye prominence and deviation in his right eye after undergoing chemotherapy. Clinical findings and additional assessments supported an optic nerve glioma diagnosis. This case underlines the significance of early detection and a collaborative approach among ophthalmologists, neurosurgeons, radiologists, and histopathologists for effective management and to limit disease progression."

    "title": "Neurofibromatosis with diffuse intestinal ganglioneuromatosis: a case report.",
    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1), a rare autosomal dominant disorder, arises from <i>NF1</i> gene mutations affecting neurofibromin, a Ras GTPase regulator. These mutations activate Ras proteins, triggering clinical symptoms such as skin spots, epilepsy, pain, and tumors. Although gastrointestinal stromal tumors are well-known in NF-1, diffuse intestinal ganglioneuromatosis remains an extremely rare complication. This paper reports a case of a 23-year-old male patient with NF1 who underwent a right hemicolectomy due to a cecal mass. Pathological findings were consistent with diffuse intestinal ganglioneuromatosis. Eight months after the surgery, the patient underwent an amputation due to the progressive enlargement of a tumor in his right lower limb, which had been present for 20 years. Pathological results confirmed NF1. Due to the high likelihood of tumor recurrence if only the mass in the right lower limb were to be resected, a surgery involving the amputation of the right lower limb along with the tumor removal was ultimately performed, followed by the installation of a prosthesis postoperatively. To date, the tumor has not recurred. However, due to psychological or skeletal developmental issues, the patient has not regained the ability to walk. This case represents a rare occurrence of neurofibromatosis accompanied by diffuse intestinal ganglioneuromatosis. The discovery and reporting of this rare case enhance the clinical understanding of neurofibromatosis (particularly in terms of uncommon complications) and enrich the clinical spectrum of neurofibromatosis and its complications, offering new insights and approaches for future treatment of similar cases."

    "abstract": "Optic nerve gliomas (ONG) are benign central nervous system tumours and the most common tumours of the optic nerve in children, often occurring before age 20. These tumours are slow-growing and can be treated with surgery and/or radiation therapy. Surgical resection is, however, associated with significant morbidity and loss of vision in the affected eye. The successful management of ONG requires a multidisciplinary, individualised approach aimed at preserving vision. This case report discusses an 11-year-old Ghanaian male diagnosed with left ONG in July 2023. He presented with blurred vision in the left eye, mild proptosis and poor vision, but no pain, headaches or neurological deficits. A contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of the orbit showed diffuse fusiform enlargement of the left optic nerve (35 × 12 × 11 mm). The successful management of ONG, in this case, using intensity-modulated radiotherapy demonstrates the potential of advanced radiotherapy techniques in preserving vision and achieving tumour control in pediatric patients, even in resource-limited settings. Continuous follow-up and a multidisciplinary approach are essential for managing the long-term outcomes and ensuring the best possible quality of life for these patients."

Cross-sectional study. Specialist outpatient clinic and patient homes. 52 children and adolescents living with neurofibromatosis type 1. Clinic BP measured thrice manually and once via an automated device; home BP measured daily with the same device for 3 days. Acceptability and feasibility were assessed with a Children's Anxiety Meter-State score, the comparability of home and clinic BPs, a parental survey, assessment of costs and the device return rate. Home systolic BP and diastolic BP were statistically similar to both clinic manual (95% CI -4.78 to 0.13; -4.80 to 0.93) and automatic BPs (95% CI -4.44 to 2.08; -0.54 to 5.52). Anxiety scores (95% CI -0.57 to 0.35) were also similar between settings. Participants and their families reported that home BP measurement was easy, took ~10 min and minimally interrupted family life. Families also largely preferred home BP screening (73% 'yes', 23% 'not sure', 3% 'no'), and 90% returned their devices. Families reported substantial costs in attending clinic, which could be reduced with access to this home BP programme. Home BP screening was acceptable and feasible, with home BPs comparable to clinic measurements, no associated anxiety and preferred by families. Telehealth with home BP screening is a viable alternative to in-person appointments, which could reduce individual costs, and foster greater equity of care and access to health services."

It is often clinically and genetically similar to neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), complicating diagnosis. This report presents a 17-year-old male with right knee pain, café-au-lait spots, and axillary freckling. Radiographs revealed NOFs in the distal femur and proximal tibia. Surgery was performed, and pathological analysis confirmed NOFs, while genetic testing revealed a pathogenic NF1 mutation. JCS remains a poorly defined syndrome, with ongoing debate about its distinction from NF1. Surgical intervention is often necessary due to the high risk of pathological fractures in patients with large NOFs. This case supports the association between JCS and NF1 and highlights the importance of genetic testing in differential diagnosis. This case report also provides a brief literature discussion on the very rare syndrome JCS."

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis-1 (NF1) dystrophic scoliosis is a challenging disease to manage surgically, with multiplanar curves progressing rapidly and unpredictably. Conservative management with bracing is often unsuccessful, and many patients necessitate instrumented fusion to halt progression of their curves. In rare cases, patients can present with spontaneous vertebral subluxation, significantly complicating the surgical management of this already complex disease process. The objective here was to describe 2 cases of vertebral subluxation in NF1-associated dystrophic scoliosis along with their surgical corrections and clinical courses. A retrospective review of 2 cases at the authors' institution was performed to describe their preoperative symptom complexes, surgical corrections, and postoperative courses. A narrative review of the literature surrounding NF1-associated dystrophic scoliosis and subluxation is also presented. Two cases of vertebral subluxation at T4-5 and C7-T1 are presented. Both patients had significant dystrophic features throughout their spines, and halo-gravity traction was unsuccessful in 1 patient and led to vertebral and subclavian artery injuries in the other. One patient underwent an uncomplicated deformity correction with partial vertebral column resection to facilitate his deformity correction. The other patient, after her vascular injuries, ultimately suffered a spinal cord injury after a fall and underwent emergent instrumentation, decompression, and partial vertebral column resection at the site of subluxation, with improvement in her neurological function afterward. Dystrophic scoliosis in NF1 remains a difficult disease to treat, and deformity correction in patients with subluxation is particularly complex. These cases here highlight the unpredictability and possible complications of halo-gravity traction, need for good fixation to facilitate subluxation reduction, high chance of hardware complications and proximal or distal failure, and importance of cooperative management of these patients in conjunction with other surgical services."

    "abstract": "NF1 encodes the multifunctional tumor suppressor protein, neurofibromin, which is best known for its causative role in neurofibromatosis type 1 and in regulating MAPK signaling. Neurofibromin, in a context-specific manner, is involved in various tumorigenic processes, including those in melanocytes. This study investigated whether NF1 loss can collaborate with oncogenic GNAQ to promote melanoma in the dermis or eyes, in which the Gαq pathway is almost always activated. We found that heterozygous 17q11.2 loss that includes the NF1 locus is a recurrent phenomenon in human intradermal and uveal melanomas described in the literature. We studied the effects of Nf1 haploinsufficiency in mice expressing oncogenic GNAQQ209L in melanocytes and Schwann cells of peripheral nerves using the Plp1-creERT transgene with tamoxifen at 5 weeks of age. Nf1 haploinsufficiency accelerated melanoma formation and/or growth. RNA sequencing analysis found significant pathways related to cAMP signaling and myogenesis. In addition, 20% of the differentially expressed genes were homologous to genes for which expression correlates with prognosis in human uveal melanoma. Unexpectedly, we found that GNAQQ209L alone was sufficient to drive cutaneous nerve sheath tumors, with one GNAQQ209L-expressing Nf1 haploinsufficient mouse also developing a plexiform variant. These tumors strongly resembled neurofibromas. We searched the cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics database and found plexiform neurofibromas with the GNAQT96S hotspot mutation. The Plp1-creERT; GNAQQ209L model with tamoxifen at 5 weeks may be useful as a preclinical model for neurofibroma. Our studies emphasize the importance of GNAQ and NF1 in regulating neural crest–derived cells existing in a dermal-like environment. These results indicate that NF1 loss in intradermal and uveal melanomas is a potentially significant finding. They emphasize the importance of neurofibromin in cAMP signaling. They show for the first time that oncogenic GNAQ can transform Schwann cells in mice. The Plp1-creERT transgene with tamoxifen given at 5 weeks may be a particularly good strategy for modeling cutaneous neurofibroma and plexiform neurofibroma."

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder affecting multiple systems. However, arterial stenosis is a rare manifestation in patients with NF1. Since the symptoms of arterial stenosis caused by NF1 are often atypical and have a high under-diagnosis rate, this can lead to serious complications such as hypertension, ischemic stroke, or even death. The aim of our research is to analyse the clinical characteristics of arterial stenosis in pediatric patients with NF1 and to summarise its diagnosis, treatment and prognosis. We conducted a retrospective review of data from patients with NF1 treated at Beijing Children's Hospital from 2016 to 2020. Patients diagnosed with arterial stenosis, identified through clinical symptoms, physical examination, arterial ultrasonography, or imaging studies, were included in this study. These patients received symptomatic drug and/or surgical treatments and were followed up regularly. We summarized demographic characteristics, sites of arterial stenosis, clinical manifestations, and treatment outcomes. Among the 258 patients with NF1 treated at our hospital, 12 (4.7%) had arterial stenosis, comprising 9 males and 3 females with a median age of 7 years (range: 1-14 years). Renal artery stenosis was diagnosed in 7 patients (58.3%), while internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis was diagnosed in 5 patients (41.7%). The predominant symptoms of renal artery and ICA stenosis were renal hypertension and convulsions, respectively. Antihypertensive drugs were effective in 5 patients with renal hypertension; 2 patients required balloon dilatation of the renal artery due to inadequate response to medication. Oral antiepileptic treatment was effective in 3 patients with ICA stenosis, and encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis was effective in the remaining 2 cases. The follow-up period ranged from 2 to 6 years, with a median duration of 3 years. No deterioration or mortality was observed during the follow-up period. Arterial stenosis was present in approximately 4.7% of patients with NF1, predominantly affecting the renal artery and ICA. Renal hypertension and convulsions were the primary symptoms of renal artery and ICA stenosis, respectively. Early diagnosis and intervention can substantially improve the prognosis of these patients."

Management includes watchful waiting, surgery for partial debulking, and, since recently, systemic treatment with MEK inhibitors. However, due to the scarcity of natural history studies, our understanding of the natural progression of PNs to guide clinicians in deciding in whom and when to intervene is scarce. This study aims to describe the characteristics of NF1 patients with PNs and compare those at high risk for PN progression or experiencing significant morbidity from PN (complex PN) with NF1 patients with PNs of lower complexity. In this retrospective cohort study using clinical data from hospital records of NF1 patients with PNs seen at the Sophia Children's Hospital in the Netherlands between 2012 and 2023, we assessed determinants of clinical phenotypes and PN characteristics predictive of outcomes, including PN complexity and the timing of intervention for PN. We assessed the outcomes using logistic regression analysis and Cox regression. Ninety patients with a median age at last evaluation of 15.7 years and a median follow-up duration of 9.8 years were included. Out of 90 individuals with a benign PN, 37 developed plexiform neurofibroma morbidity during follow-up. Older age was (corrected for pathogenic NF1 variant and PN location) significantly associated with plexiform neurofibroma morbidity. Cox regression revealed that craniofacial and trunk PNs were associated with a higher intervention hazard compared to limb PNs. Our pilot multivariate approach identified older age and the location of the PN to be mostly associated with a higher chance of plexiform neurofibroma morbidity and higher intervention hazard. This may contribute to decisions regarding in whom and when to initiate treatment in NF1 patients with PNs."

These malignancies develop within preexisting benign lesions called plexiform neurofibromas (PNs). PNs are solely driven by biallelic <i>NF1</i> loss eliciting RAS pathway activation, and they respond favorably to MEK inhibitor therapy. MPNSTs harbor additional mutations and respond poorly to MEK inhibition. Our analysis of genetically engineered and orthotopic patient-derived xenograft MPNST models indicates that MEK inhibition has poor antitumor efficacy. By contrast, upstream inhibition of RAS through the protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 reduced downstream signaling and suppressed <i>NF1</i> MPNST growth, although resistance eventually emerged. To investigate possible mechanisms of acquired resistance, kinomic analyses of resistant tumors were performed, and data analysis identified enrichment of activated autophagy pathway protein kinases. Combining SHP2 inhibition with hydroxychloroquine (HQ) resulted in durable responses in <i>NF1</i> MPNSTs in both genetic and orthotopic xenograft mouse models. Our studies could be rapidly translated into a clinical trial to evaluate SHP2 inhibition in conjunction with HQ as a unique treatment approach for <i>NF1</i> MPNSTs."

    "abstract": "Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) is an aggressive soft-tissue sarcoma that develops sporadically or in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Its development is marked by the inactivation of specific tumor suppressor genes (TSG): NF1, CDKN2A, and SUZ12/EED (polycomb repressor complex 2). Each TSG loss can be targeted by particular drug inhibitors, and we aimed to systematically combine these inhibitors, guided by TSG inactivation status, to test their precision medicine potential for MPNSTs. We performed a high-throughput screening in 3 MPNST cell lines testing 14 MEK inhibitors (MEKi), 11 cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitors (CDKi), and 3 bromodomain inhibitors (BETi) as single agents and 147 pairwise co-treatments. Best combinations were validated in nine MPNST cell lines, and three were tested in one sporadic and one NF1-associated patient-derived orthotopic xenograft (PDOX) MPNST mouse model. A final combination of the three inhibitor classes was tested in the same PDOX models. A high degree of redundancy was observed in the effect of compounds of the same inhibitory class, individually or in combination, and responses matched with TSG inactivation status. The MEKi-BETi (ARRY-162 + I-BET151) co-treatment triggered a reduction in half of the NF1-related MPNST PDOXs and all the sporadic tumors, reaching 65% reduction in tumor volume in the latter. Remarkably, this reduction was further increased in both models combining the three inhibitor classes, reaching 85% shrinkage on average in the sporadic MPNST. Our results strongly support precision therapies for MPNSTs guided by TSG inactivation status. MEKi-BETi CDKi triple treatment elicits a significant reduction of human MPNST PDOXs."

    "abstract": "Despite their similar nomenclature, Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and \"Neurofibromatosis type 2\" are discrete and clinically distinguishable entities. The name of \"neurofibromatosis type 2\" has been changed to NF2-related schwannomatosis, to reflect the fact that neurofibromas do not occur in this syndrome and therefore the name \"Neurofibromatosis\" is factually incorrect. Furthermore, multiple schwannomas, a hallmark feature of NF2, can also occur in patients with mutations in genes including SMARCB1 and LZTR1, all exhibiting overlapping clinical features. Current understanding suggests that schwannomatosis (SWN) encompasses a range of clinical presentations consisting of clearly defined, separate subtypes which share a common phenotype of schwannomas. Recognizing these newly emerging subtypes, the International Consensus Group on Neurofibromatosis Diagnostic Criteria (I-NF-DC) proposed a revised nomenclature for NF2 and related disorders in 2022. This review article focuses on this critical update in diagnostic terminology, highlighting the key gene-related SWN subtypes relevant to neuroradiologists. By emphasizing molecular testing alongside clinical features, the revised system facilitates a more precise diagnosis, potentially paving the way for personalized treatment strategies.

We propose an age-adapted diagnostic and therapeutic approach to patients with NF1, subdivided into four main areas. We suggest follow-up examinations every one to two years to address typical course of the disease as well as administrative aspects, such as care by pediatricians. Whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) should be performed when the diagnosis is made. MRI and ultrasonography of particular body regions should be performed where appropriate. The NF1 gene should be sequenced to determine the causative pathogenic variant and as an aid to genetic counseling. If this fails to reveal a pathogenic variant, the NF1 gene should also be sequenced in tumor tissue. The vitamin D3 and sex hormone status are also relevant, as are serum metanephrines. Further specialist consultations may be necessary, and their findings should be discussed in an interdisciplinary framework. These recommendations are intended to serve as a guide to a standardized interdisciplinary approach to the management of patients with NF1 in Germany, based on an up-to-date scientific understanding of the disease. This approach should improve care overall, both by enabling better care and by eliminating unnecessary diagnostic studies."

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) significantly increases the risk of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST), a rare and aggressive malignancy for which treatment is clinically challenging. This paper presents the case of a 24-year-old male with an NF1 who developed MPNST with lung metastases. Due to the limited effectiveness of systemic therapy in the treatment of MPNST, the patient underwent radical surgical resection and radiotherapy. Pathological evaluation confirmed high-grade MPNST, and PET-CT imaging revealed further metastatic progression. The treatment results for our patient are compared with those of other patients with NF1 who also developed MPNST with lung metastases in the literature. The findings suggest the need for further research into personalized treatment strategies that may improve prognosis and overall survival in patients with NF1 and MPNST, with immunotherapy being a promising therapeutic option."

    "abstract": "Rasopathies, including Noonan Syndrome (NS) and Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), are developmental disorders caused by germline mutations in genes of the RAS/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (RAS-MAPK). This study investigates irritability, a highly prevalent transdiagnostic construct, in children with Rasopathies and the impact of Rasopathy status on the associations between irritability, emotional dysregulation-related disorders, and social skills impairments. The sample comprise 174 children aged 4-17 (age mean = 9.49; 98 females), including 113 children with Rasopathies (NS n = 85, NF1 n = 28) and 61 age-sex-matched typically developed (TD) children. We used parent questionnaires (CBCL, SRS) to assess irritability, symptoms of ADHD, defiance, anxiety/depression, and social skills impairments while controlling for cognitive measures (IQ). Children with Rasopathies exhibited higher irritability than TD children (mean difference = 1.09; p < 0.001). Children with NS showed a weaker association between irritability and ADHD symptoms compared to TD children (<i>p</i> = .032, η<sub>p</sub> <sup>2</sup> = .03) and a stronger association between irritability and social skills impairments compared to both TD (<i>p</i> = .033, η<sub>p</sub> <sup>2</sup> = .03), and NF1 groups (<i>p</i> = .009, η<sub>p</sub> <sup>2</sup> = .06). We present novel and clinically significant findings showing high irritability in children with Rasopathies. Our study provides syndrome-specific results, suggesting differences in the mechanisms involved in irritability, ADHD, and social processes in children with NS and NF1. In essence, children with Rasopathies showed a highly irritable profile associated with ADHD symptoms and social skills impairments, with a significantly stronger association between irritability and social processes in NS. Our results suggest that developing prevention and treatments targeting irritability can distinctly affect the trajectories of neurodevelopmental disorders in children with Rasopathies."

    "abstract": "The MEK inhibitor selumetinib induces objective responses and provides clinical benefit in children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and inoperable plexiform neurofibromas (PNs). To evaluate whether similar outcomes were possible in adult patients, in whom PN growth is generally slower than in pediatric patients, we conducted an open-label phase 2 study of selumetinib in adults with NF1 PNs. The study was designed to evaluate objective response rate (primary objective), tumor volumetric responses, patient-reported outcomes and pharmacodynamic effects in PN biopsies. The objective response rate was 63.6% (21/33 participants). Median maximal PN volume decrease was 23.6% (range: -48.1% to 5.5%). No disease progression relative to baseline PN volumes occurred before data cutoff, with a median of 28 cycles completed (range: 1-78, 28 d per cycle). Participants experienced decreased tumor pain intensity and pain interference. Adverse events (AEs) were similar to those of the pediatric trial; acneiform rash was the most prevalent AE. Phosphorylation ratios of ERK1/2 decreased significantly (ERK1 median change: -64.6% (range: -99.5% to 90.7%), ERK2 median change: -57.3% (range: -99.9% to 84.4%)) in paired PN biopsies (P ≤ 0.001 for both isoforms) without compensatory phosphorylation of AKT1/2/3. The sustained PN volume decreases, associated improvement in pain and manageable AE profile indicate that selumetinib provides benefit to adults with NF1 and inoperable PNs.

NF1 typically presents with skin lesions, including freckles, café-au-lait macules, plexiform neurofibromas, and bony dysplasia, and is usually accompanied by a family history of the disorder. Ocular manifestations vary, but iris Lisch nodules and optic nerve gliomas are the most common features. However, patients with NF1 may also present with rare ocular findings, such as neovascular glaucoma, astrocytic hamartomas, choroidal nodules, and retinal vascular abnormalities. Here, we report a case of an 18-year-old female patient, born to consanguineous parents, who had never been diagnosed with NF1, nor had any of her family members. The patient presented with unilateral, long-standing vitreous hemorrhage, significant retinal ischemia, and neovascularization. Her examination revealed typical features of NF1, including iris Lisch nodules, café-au-lait spots, and axillary freckling. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbits, along with dedicated vascular imaging, was performed, and a sectoral laser treatment was applied to the ischemic retina to prevent neovascular glaucoma."

However, there have been no real-world reports on Japanese patients. In this study, we reported a single-center, short-term experience with selumetinib after its approval in Japan. We prospectively collected data from 11 pediatric NF1 patients with symptomatic, inoperable PN who were initiated on selumetinib between November 2022 and May 2023; the selumetinib was administered by the same physician. Various patient factors, tumors, dose and efficacy of selumetinib, and adverse events (AE) were investigated. Of 11 patients included, 7 were male, with a mean age of 14 years. The sites of symptomatic main PN included the head and neck, pelvis to lower extremities, and paraspinal lesions in five, three, and three patients, respectively. The median maximum diameter of the main PN was 91 mm, and the median follow-up duration was 19 months. All patients with pain or motor dysfunction experienced symptom improvement after treatment, and the tumors tended to shrink in 7 of the 11 patients (64%). Among the six patients with disfigurements, only one experienced improvement. Of 59 AEs observed, 58 (98%) were grades 1 and 2, and 5 patients (46%) underwent temporary selumetinib withdrawal due to AEs. One patient discontinued the drug (9%) because of rash dermatitis. Despite the relatively short-term results, no serious AEs were observed, and many patients benefited from selumetinib treatment. In some patients, administration was discontinued or interrupted because of the balance between benefits and AEs, and further data are needed to better understand the general safety and efficacy of selumetinib."

Currently, the primary objective is to perform surgical total resection as far as possible, while considering postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy for cases where complete tumor resection is challenging. In this case, the patient has previously undergone multiple brain tumor resections and received radiation therapy. Currently, the tumor is exerting pressure on the brain stem, leading to a diminished quality of life. Considering the patient's personal preferences, overall physical condition, and economic circumstances, it was determined that surgical decompression would no longer be pursued.

    "abstract": "Plexiform neurofibromas (PNFs) are benign tumors that affect 20‑50% of patients with type I neurofibromatosis (NF1). PNF carries a risk of malignancy. There is no effective cure for PNF. Its onset may be associated with genetic and metabolic abnormalities, but the exact mechanisms remain unclear. Succinate‑CoA ligase GDP/ADP‑Forming Subunit α(SUCLG1), a catalytic enzyme in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, is highly expressed in PNF. The present study aimed to explore the role of SUCLG1 in function and metabolism of PNF cells. SUCLG1 expression was verified using western blotting and immunofluorescence. After inducing SUCLG1 knockdown and overexpression, functional changes in PNF cells were assessed, as well as effects of SUCLG1 on cell respiration and glucose metabolism. Quantitative PCR, WB, electron microscopy and Flow cytometry demonstrated that SUCLG1 enhanced mitochondrial quality and promoted mitochondrial fusion, thereby driving proliferation and migration of tumor cells, inhibiting apoptosis and altering the cell cycle. A Seahorse assay showed that elevated SUCLG1 expression enhanced cell aerobic respiration without affecting the glycolytic process. This suggests that SUCLG1 upregulation in PNF does not trigger the Warburg effect associated with malignant tumors. This study also demonstrated the positive regulation of cellular function by promoting the expression level of the <i>SLC25A1</i> gene when SUCLG1 expression was elevated. In conclusion, SUCLG1 altered the mechanism of mitochondrial quality control to enhance cell aerobic respiration, thereby driving the pathogenesis of PNF. Thus, SUCLG1 can serve as a potential target in future therapeutic strategies."

    "abstract": "Neurofibromas are rare benign tumors of peripheral nerve sheaths, and hand involvement is particularly uncommon. This case report presents a large neurofibroma located in the thenar region, a critical area for thumb opposition and hand dexterity, posing unique surgical challenges. A 23-year-old female presented with a 3-year history of a progressively enlarging mass in the thenar region of the right hand, accompanied by nocturnal pain but no neurological deficits. MRI revealed a well-circumscribed, multilobulated tumor measuring 54 × 55 × 33.4 mm. Surgical excision was successfully performed while preserving the median nerve. Postoperative recovery was assessed using the QuickDASH questionnaire, yielding a score of 6, indicative of excellent functional outcomes. Histopathology confirmed a benign neurofibroma. The large size and rare location of this tumor, combined with the absence of neurofibromatosis type 1, make this case noteworthy. Early diagnosis and meticulous surgical planning enabled complete excision while preserving critical structures, resulting in full functional recovery with no recurrence after 18 months. This case underscores the importance of individualized surgical strategies for managing neurofibromas in functionally critical areas. While excellent long-term outcomes were achieved in this instance, further studies are needed to validate these findings and refine management approaches."

More than half of the patients have new de novo pathogenic variants of the NF1 gene. In most family cases, all family members share an identical NF1-variant. The aim of the study was to investigate the very rare phenomenon of de novo variants in cases of familial neurofibromatosis type 1 and highlight its implications for genetic testing and counseling. Patients underwent clinical examination in our NF outpatient clinic and genetic testing for the NF1-gene was performed by targeted sequencing. All family members were profiled by short-tandem repeat marker analysis. Additionally, a probability calculation was performed for this extremely rare event. In one NF1 family consisting of mother, father, and two sons, two different pathogenic variants of the NF1 gene were found. The father and one son share one NF1-variant and the other son carries a different de novo NF1-variant. Neither of these two NF1-variants was found in the unaffected mother. Short-tandem repeat analysis confirmed the paternity and revealed that the two sons inherited two different NF1-alleles from their father. The probability of two different NF1-variants occurring in one family is calculated as 1:9,000,000. Two different NF1-variants in one family is an extremely rare phenomenon: yet its occurrence is not impossible and therefore should be considered in genetic diagnosis and counselling. For an offspring with the indication for neurofibromatosis type 1, but lacking the familial pathogenic variant, a screening of the whole NF1-gene is necessary to detect potential new pathogenic variants and for exact diagnosis."

In this prospective single-centre study, thirty-four NF1 patients (18 male; 30 ± 11 years) underwent F-18-FDG-PET/CT and multi-b-value DW-MRI (11 b-values 0 - 800 s/mm²) at 3T. Sixty-six lesions corresponding to 39 BPNST, 11 ANF, and 16 MPNST were evaluated. Two radiologists independently assessed the maximum standardized uptake value (SUV<sub>max</sub>) and mean and minimum apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC<sub>mean/min</sub>) as well as the ADC in areas of lowest signal intensity in each lesion (ADC<sub>dark</sub>). The AUCs of DW-MRI and F-18-FDG-PET/CT were compared to determine whether the ADC is non-inferior to SUV<sub>max</sub> (non-inferiority margin equal to -10%). Follow-up of ≥ 24 months (BPNST) or histopathological evaluation (MPNST + ANF) served as diagnostic reference standard. Both SUV<sub>max</sub> and ADC parameters demonstrated good diagnostic accuracy (AUC<sub>SUVmax</sub> 94.0%; AUC<sub>ADCmean/min/dark</sub> 91.6% / 90.1% / 92.5%). However, non-inferiority could not be demonstrated for any of the three ADC parameters (lower limits of the confidence intervals of the difference between the AUC of ADC<sub>mean/min/dark</sub> and SUV<sub>max</sub> -12.9% / -14.5% / -11.6%). Inter-rater reliability was excellent for both imaging techniques (Krippendorff's alpha all > 0.94). Both PET/CT-derived SUV<sub>max</sub> and MRI-derived ADC allow sensitive and non-invasive differentiation of benign and (pre)-malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours. Nevertheless, DW-MRI cannot be considered as non-inferior to F-18-FDG-PET/CT in this prospective single-centre study."

This case report focuses on clinical and radiological presentations and surgical interventions during six years of follow-up, comparing the results with those in the literature. A five-year-old female with NF1 disease was diagnosed with a spontaneous calvarial defect in the occipital region and an arachnoid cyst underneath. The lesion enlarged progressively over the years and at the age of nine, she underwent her first surgery. Our surgery team performed a cranioplasty using a split-thickness bone graft harvested from the parietal bone after cyst decompression. Two years later, she underwent revision surgery with a titanium mesh plate due to total resorption of the initial bone graft and unsuccessful closure of the large defect. Calvaria defects are a relatively unknown aspect of NF1, and no standard treatment exists. Their management requires a personalized approach, considering factors like lesion size, and the potential for multiple interventions throughout the patient's lifetime. Due to their progressive nature and the possibility of additional lesions, long-term follow-up is crucial for effective monitoring and intervention planning."

These disorders include Noonan syndrome (NS), cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome (CFC), Costello syndrome (CS), Legius syndrome (LS), and neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), and have overlapping clinical features due to RAS/MAPK dysfunction. In this study, we aimed to describe the clinical and molecular features of patients exhibiting phenotypic manifestations consistent with RASopathies. The study included 149 patients from 146 unrelated families who were admitted between 2019 and 2023 with a clinical suspicion of RASopathy spectrum disorder. Clinical and laboratory characteristics of the patients at the time of the diagnosis were obtained from hospital records. Variant analysis of twenty-four RASopathy genes was performed using a targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) panel, and the variants were classified according to American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics Standards and Guidelines recommendations. Pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants were detected in 39 out of 149 patients (26.1%). Thirty-two patients were diagnosed as NS (32/39; 82%). The variants detected in NS patients were PTPN11 (21/32; 65.6%), LZTR1 (3/32; 9.3%), SOS1 (2/32; 6.2%), RAF1 (2/32; 6.2%), RIT1 (2/32; 6.2%), KRAS (1/32; 3.1%), and RRAS (1/32; 3.1%) genes, respectively. The remaining patients were diagnosed with CS (2/39; 5.1%), NF1 (2/39; 5.1%), NF-NS (2/39; 5.1%), and CFC (1/39; 2.5%). We observed rare clinical findings including lymphangioma circumscriptum, Meckel's diverticulum, and omphalocele in three patients with PTPN11 gene variations. Additionally, we detected corpus callosum thickness in a patient with the SOS1 gene variant, which has not been previously described in NS. We also identified three novel variants in RIT1, BRAF, and NF1 genes. In this study, we described rare clinical manifestations and detected three novel variants in NF1, BRAF, and RIT1 genes. We propose that NGS technology enables the detection of variants in rare genes responsible for the etiology of RASopathies. The study, therefore, not only contributes to the existing literature but also expands the spectrum of genotype and phenotype of RASopathies. • RASopathies are a group of disorders caused by germline variants in genes involved in the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (RAS/MAPK) pathway. • These disorders, including Noonan syndrome (NS), Cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome (CFC), Costello syndrome (CS), Legius syndrome, and Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), share overlapping clinical features due to RAS/MAPK dysfunction. Molecular diagnosis of RASopathies is crucial for understanding the genetic basis and guiding clinical management, although the phenotype-genotype relationships remain incompletely defined. • This study provides new insights into the molecular and clinical characteristics of RASopathies by examining 149 patients from 146 families, with a focus on the genetic variants found in 24 RASopathy-related genes. Three novel variants were identified in the RIT1, BRAF, and NF1 genes, expanding the genetic spectrum of RASopathies. • Additionally, rare clinical findings, such as lymphangioma circumscriptum and corpus callosum thickness, were reported in patients with PTPN11 and SOS1 gene variations, respectively. These observations contribute new phenotypic data to the existing body of knowledge."

Systematic literature searches were conducted in Scopus, PsycINFO, Web of Science, PubMed, and ProQuest in September 2022, with a supplemental search conducted in Google Scholar in February 2023. The searches identified 2,153 unique articles. Screening identified 114 academic journal articles that assessed parent/caregiver- or teacher-reported ADHD symptoms for children/adolescents with NF1. Two researchers independently screened articles and extracted data. The primary outcome was group differences in ADHD symptoms between children/adolescents with and without NF1 (Hedges g). Data were analyzed using robust variance estimation and random-effects models. The meta-analysis included 70 studies (138 effect sizes), involving 3,653 children/adolescents with NF1 (46% female; mean age = 9.69 years, SD = 2.60 years) and 4,895 children/adolescents without NF1 (48% female; mean age = 10.03 years, SD = 3.10 years). According to parent/caregiver reports, children/adolescents with NF1 exhibited more severe inattentive symptoms (g = 1.20; 95% CI = 1.06-1.35), hyperactive/impulsive symptoms (g = 0.85; 95% CI = 0. 68-1.03), and combined ADHD symptoms (g = 1.02; 95% CI = 0.87-1.17) than unaffected controls. Inattentive ADHD symptoms were more elevated than hyperactivity/impulsivity for children/adolescents with NF1. Larger effect sizes for inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity were associated with older age, lower intelligence quotient (IQ), and parent/caregiver vs teacher reports. NF1 is a monogenic condition that has strong associations with elevated ADHD symptoms. Findings highlight the importance of early intervention and targeted support for ADHD-related problems in children with NF1. Increasing evidence has suggested a higher risk for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). In this study of ADHD symptom severity in youth with NF1, the authors analyzed data from 70 articles. The authors found much more severe ADHD symptoms in children and adolescents with NF1 compared to youth without NF1.

Nonsense variants were the most frequently observed (35.71%), followed by frameshift (23.8%), splice site (14.29%), deletion (11.9%), missense (9.5%), and in-frame deletions (4.76%) in our case series. Three variants (c. 5269-1G > C, c. 1541_1542del AG, and c. 6853_6854insA) were identified in more than one patient, suggesting that the variants are widely distributed in the gene and lack any mutational hotspot. This study supports the previous findings that patients with the variant c. 2970_2972delAAT do not develop neurofibromas; however, it was not necessary for those with whole gene deletion to have dysmorphic features as reported by other studies. The study could not establish any correlation between the type of variants and specific clinical features. Around 28% of mutations could be identified by screening exons 14, 28, 37, 46 and intron 37 in this population. This study will contribute to a better understanding of the phenotypic variability of neurofibromatosis patients. The variable expressivity seen in NF1 suggests that modifying genes may be involved in the development of particular clinical features in addition to NF1 mutations."

    "abstract": "The management of spinal deformities in patients with NF-1 is challenging. The study aimed to assess the outcomes of the surgical treatment of spine deformities in children with neurofibromatosis type 1 with our treatment approach. A retrospective single-center study on pediatric patients with spinal deformities associated with NF-1 who received surgical treatment between 2006 and 2024. The study group comprised 42 patients with a mean age at surgery of 9.8 years. Twenty-five patients (60%) were treated by means of growth-preserving techniques and 17 patients (40%) by means of definitive fusion. Preoperative halo-gravity traction was used in 14 (33%) cases. In the group treated with a growth-preserving technique, a 54.1% mean curve correction was observed at the latest follow-up, and growth of the thoracic spine was maintained at a physiological rate; however, 25 unplanned revision surgeries (mostly due to mechanical complications) were necessary. In the group treated by definitive fusion, a 66% curve correction was achieved at initial surgery, which remained unchanged at latest follow-up, and revision surgery was performed in three cases for augmentation of the fusion mass. There was one neurological complication (2%). Another patient developed a deep wound infection (2%). Good and sustainable surgical correction of spinal deformities can be achieved in pediatric patients with NF-1. Due to the bony dystrophic changes, surgical treatment is challenging and the complication rate is higher than in spinal deformities of other etiologies."

    "title": "Cognition and behavior in adults with neurofibromatosis type 1.",
    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) is a congenital neurocutaneous disorder. As NF1 is incurable and presents with a wide range of physical and mental symptoms, knowledge of neurocognitive and behavioral functioning can be an important aid in understanding their functional impact, and developing treatment options. To date, studies in children with NF1 have shown dysfunction in several domains, but much less is known about cognition and behavior in adults with NF1. The present study describes the neuropsychological phenotype of adults with NF1 based on comprehensive clinical examination of cognition and behavior across multiple functions. Participants were 62 adults with NF1 (mean age 38.2 years; <i>SD</i> 13.4). All underwent individual clinical neuropsychological assessment at the Center of Excellence for Neuropsychiatry as part of regular care. Scores on all individual measures were standardized into z-scores based on the corresponding normative group data. The proportions of mean z-scores in the NF1 study group were calculated according to cut-off points (±1 to ±1.5 SD; > ±1.5 SD) and compared to the expected proportions in the normal population distribution. Cognition and behavior was tested against population means constructed by bootstrapping. Performance on the cognitive measures oral reading speed, visuospatial copying, visuospatial immediate recall, visual learning/imprinting, and visual memory immediate recall in the NF1 group were lower than normative means. The behavioral measures indicated higher levels of dysfunction, including psychopathology. The proportions of the NF1 study group with lower cognitive performance and higher levels of behavioral dysfunction were larger than in the normal population distributions. In addition, domain-level results revealed that intelligence, attention/speed, memory, and social cognition reflect cognitive dysfunction. Moreover, levels of emotion perception problems, experienced executive dysfunction, internalizing psychopathology (e.g., anxiety, depression), and severe fatigue were significantly higher compared to the simulated population sample. The mean level of emotion regulation (coping strategies) did not differ significantly from the population. Identified cognitive and behavioral dysfunction in multiple domains indicates high vulnerability in adults with NF1 and underscores the importance of individualized neuropsychological assessment and treatment. Further research on the relationships between cognition and behavior (including fatigue) in NF1 is warranted."

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 is an autosomal dominant disorder predisposing to numerous tumors. Sporadic mutations account for half of the cases. They can occur on a mosaic pattern, which might remain undiagnosed, depending on the clinical phenotype. We carried out an extended ophthalmological assessment followed by a neurological examination as well as a cardiovascular and an orthopedic examination. The patient's DNA was drawn and next generation sequencing was used on a multigenic panel (NF1, NF2, SPRED1, LZTR1, SMARCB1, SMARCE1). A written informed consent was obtained from the patient. We report the case of a thirty-year-old male who presented for a routine ocular checkup. An incidental finding of bilateral numerous bright patchy areas was made on near infrared reflectance imaging, alongside retinal microvascular anomalies. Further questioning and examination revealed café-au-lait macules and axillary freckling, but no Lisch nodules. The patient was referred for genetic testing and a somatic mosaic mutation was found on the NF1 gene (c.4084C>T on the exon 30) with a variant allele frequency of 20%. This report highlights the role of near infrared reflectance imaging in the incidental finding of choroidal alterations, which led to the diagnosis of NF1 mosaicism."

As a personal history, he had neurofibromatosis type 1 and his daughter, with the same disease, who has been operated of astrocytoma. Upon clinical assessment, the patient's ophthalmic examination was bitemporal hemianoptia, and hormonal evaluation confirmed hypopituitarism. Pituitary magnetic resonance imaging showed a suprasellar homogeneous enhancing post-gadolinium mass causing chiasmatic displacement. Transnasal transsphenoidal resection was performed. Postoperatively, the patient developed diabetes insipidus. Histopathology showed patterns consistent with pituicytoma. and immunohistochemistry confirmed it.

    "abstract": "Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) can severely impact functioning yet effective treatments are limited. Greater insight into the neurobiology underlying NDDs is critical to the development of successful treatments. Using a genetics-first approach, we investigated the potential of advanced diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) techniques to characterize the neural microstructure unique to neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and Noonan syndrome (NS). In this prospective study, children with NF1, NS, and typical developing (TD) were scanned using a multi-shell DWI sequence optimized for neurite orientation density and dispersion imaging (NODDI) and diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI). Region-of-interest and tract-based analysis were conducted on subcortical regions and white matter tracts. Analysis of covariance, principal components, and linear discriminant analysis compared between three groups. 88 participants (M<sub>age</sub> = 9.36, SD<sub>age</sub> = 2.61; 44 male) were included: 31 NS, 25 NF1, and 32 TD. Subcortical regions differed between NF1 and NS, particularly in the thalamus where the neurite density index (NDI; estimated difference 0.044 [95% CI: -0.034, 0.053], d = 2.36), orientation dispersion index (ODI; estimate 0.018 [95% CI: 0.010, 0.026], d = 1.39), and mean kurtosis (MK; estimate 0.049 [95% CI: 0.025, 0.072], d = 1.39) were lower in NF1 compared with NS (all p < 0.0001). Reduced NDI was found in NF1 and NS compared with TD in all 39 white matter tracts investigated (p < 0.0001). Reduced MK was found in a majority of the tracts in NF1 and NS relative to TD, while fewer differences in ODI were observed. The middle cerebellar peduncle showed lower NDI (estimate 0.038 [95% CI: 0.021, 0.056], p < 0.0001) and MK (estimate 0.057 [95% CI: 0.026, 0.089], p < 0.0001) in NF1 compared to NS. Multivariate analyses distinguished between groups using NDI, ODI, and MK measures. Principal components analysis confirmed that the clinical groups differ most from TD in white matter tract-based NDI and MK, whereas ODI values appear similar across the groups. The subcortical regions showed several differences between NF1 and NS, to the extent that a linear discriminant analysis could classify participants with NF1 with an accuracy rate of 97%. Differences in neural microstructure were detected between NF1 and NS, particularly in subcortical regions and the middle cerebellar peduncle, in line with pre-clinical evidence. Advanced DWI techniques detected subtle alterations not found in prior work using conventional diffusion tensor imaging."

    "abstract": "Red-blue neurofibromas (RBNs), found in up to 29% of adult neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) patients, present as red-blue macules measuring 1-2 cm in diameter, primarily on the trunk. Despite their prevalence, RBNs often go unnoticed due to their subtle appearance. Ultrasound characterization serves as a diagnostic clue yet lacks comprehensive studies in both adult and pediatric populations. This study aims to define and compare RBNs' prevalence, characteristics, and ultrasound features in adult and pediatric patients with NF1. This prospective study involved 118 patients (92 pediatric patients and 26 adults) diagnosed with NF1. Clinical examinations combined with cutaneous ultrasound scans using linear multifrequency probes (L4-12t, L10-22, ML6-15, or L8-18 MHz) were performed in order to determine the prevalence, and clinical and sonographic characteristics of RBN in both populations. Statistical analyses were performed using t tests and chi-square tests. RBNs were found in 26.3% (31) of the patients after clinical examination, including 179 lesions. RBN prevalence differed significantly between pediatric (10.9%) and adult (66.7%) patients. Lesions were primarily on the trunk and exhibited similar clinical characteristics. Ultrasound reveals RBNs as hypoechoic, oval lesions with irregular borders. Our results show that pediatric RBNs are typically more superficial and hypoechogenic, while adult RBNs are deeper and more heterogeneous. Ultrasound findings showed subtle differences in lesion depth, morphology, and echogenicity between these 2 age-related groups. These changes highlight ultrasound's role in identifying RBNs in patients with NF1 and monitoring their evolution."

    "abstract": "Isolated neurofibromas of the nasal tip are uncommon, particularly in pediatric patients. Neurofibromas are benign tumors that arise from the peripheral nerve sheath and are usually associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Isolated cases present unique challenges due to their location and the importance of cosmetic outcomes. This case highlights the presentation, diagnostic process, and management of a rare nasal tip neurofibroma in an 11-year-old girl. An 11-year-old female presented with a gradually enlarging mass on the nasal tip over several months, causing cosmetic concern without pain, bleeding, or obstruction. Clinical examination revealed a firm, non-tender lesion, about 1 cm in diameter, with normal skin. Imaging confirmed a well-defined mass localized to the nasal tip. Surgical excision was performed, and histopathology confirmed a diagnosis of neurofibroma. Follow-up showed no recurrence, and the patient was satisfied with the cosmetic result. Neurofibromas, though benign, can cause aesthetic concerns, particularly in prominent areas like the nasal tip. Isolated neurofibromas in children without NF1 are rare. Surgical excision is the treatment of choice, with emphasis on complete removal to prevent recurrence. This case demonstrates successful excision with clear margins, preserving nasal structure and appearance. Long-term monitoring is essential for recurrence prevention. Isolated neurofibroma of the nasal tip is a rare condition in children. Surgical excision remains the treatment of choice, with careful planning required to preserve both cosmetic and functional outcomes. Regular follow-up is crucial to monitor for recurrence, especially in the absence of neurofibromatosis."

    "abstract": "Malignant peripheral nerve-sheath tumor (MPNST) is rare, occurring in approximately 0.001% of the general population. Cases involving cranial nerves, and particularly the trigeminal nerve (V), are exceptionally rare, with only 36 cases reported in a literature review in 2013. Standardized treatment and follow-up protocols are lacking. Here, we present a case of MPNST of the trigeminal nerve, provide a review of all cases described in the literature, and discuss treatment, surgical approach, recurrence rate, follow-up time and prognosis. Based on PRISMA guidelines, we reviewed all cases of trigeminal MPNST published between 1950 and September 2023. We analyzed risk factors for recurrence. And we report the case of a patient with trigeminal MPNST admitted to our hospital. The literature review retrieved 39 relevant studies, reporting 48 cases. Patient age ranged from 4 to 71 years, for a mean 44.4 ± 17 years. The male:female ratio was 3.8:1. Most cases developed sporadically; 1 patient had neurofibromatosis type 1 and 1 had type 2. Surgery was the first-line treatment (85%), and radiotherapy was often included as adjuvant (65%). During a mean follow-up of 23.1 ± 24.4 months, fatal outcomes occurred in approximately 30% of patients. Only 1 case of systemic metastasis was reported. The only prognostic factor significantly associated with a lower rate of recurrence was complete surgical resection (p = 0.0035). Cranial nerve MPNST is extremely rare, and trigeminal MPNST is even rarer. Treatment corresponds to current recommendations for intracranial MPNST, in which radical resection with adjuvant radiotherapy under stereotactic conditions results in the best outcome. Because of the high risk of recurrence, especially in case of incomplete resection, close follow-up is mandatory. Proton-beam therapy could be an interesting alternative adjuvant therapy after surgery."

Although the malignant manifestations of cancer predisposition syndromes are well-studied, recognizing their non-malignant features is crucial for early diagnosis, especially in children and adolescents. A comprehensive literature search was conducted using the PubMed database, focusing on non-malignant manifestations of cancer predisposition syndromes in children and adolescents. Key sources included the Clinical Cancer Research pediatric oncology series and ORPHANET. Studies that described clinical signs and symptoms affecting specific organ systems were included. Non-malignant dermatological features often serve as early indicators of cancer predisposition syndromes, including café-au-lait spots in Neurofibromatosis Type 1 and facial angiofibromas in Tuberous Sclerosis Complex. Neurological and developmental anomalies such as cerebellar ataxia in ataxia-telangiectasia and intellectual disabilities in neurofibromatosis type 1 and tuberous sclerosis complex are significant indicators. Growth and metabolic anomalies are also notable, including overgrowth in Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome and growth hormone deficiency in neurofibromatosis Type 1. In addition, facial anomalies, ocular manifestations, hearing issues, and thyroid anomalies are prevalent across various cancer predisposition syndromes. For instance, hearing loss may be significant in neurofibromatosis Type 2, while thyroid nodules are common in PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome and DICER1 syndrome. Cardiovascular, abdominal, musculoskeletal, pulmonary, genitourinary manifestations, and prenatal deviations further complicate the clinical picture. Recognizing non-malignant features of cancer predisposition syndromes is essential for early diagnosis and management.

In Nigeria and West Africa, there is a paucity of literature and studies on neurofibromas. This study aims to analyse the histopathologic and immunohistochemical patterns of neurofibromas and determine the frequency, demographic and anatomic distributions. The study was a hospital-based retrospective study, and the study population constituted all surgical specimens submitted for histological examination to the Department of Pathology between 1<sup>st</sup> January 2010 to 31<sup>st</sup> December 2019 reported as neurofibroma. Records were retrieved from the archives and subjected to histopathologic and immunohistochemical analysis following standard protocols.

A total of 125 cases were seen constituting 8.3% of all soft tissue tumours seen. Neurofibromas were more prevalent in females with a male-to-female ratio of 1:1.15. The age ranged between 2-70 years with a mean age of 25.38 years and the highest frequency of occurrence was in the second decade of life. The most frequent anatomic site of occurrence was the head and neck region. Most of the tumours 103 (82.4%) were sporadic while 22(17.6%) were Syndromic and associated with NF1.

    "abstract": "Dysregulation of molecular pathways associated with mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and elevated rates of neurodevelopmental disorders are implicated in the genetic syndromes neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), fragile X syndrome (FXS), and Noonan syndrome (NS). Given shared molecular and clinical features, understanding convergent and divergent implications of these syndromes on brain development may offer unique insights into disease mechanisms. While an increasing number of studies have examined brain volumes in these syndromes, the effects of each syndrome on global and subcortical brain volumes are unclear. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to synthesize existing literature on volumetric brain changes across TSC, FXS, NF1, and NS. Study outcomes were the effect sizes of the genetic syndromes on whole brain, gray and white matter, and subcortical volumes compared to typically developing controls. We performed a series of meta-analyses synthesizing data from 23 studies in NF1, TSC, FXS, and NS (pooled N = 1556) reporting whole brain volume, gray and white matter volumes, and volumes of subcortical structures compared to controls. Meta-analyses revealed significantly larger whole brain volume, gray and white matter volumes, and subcortical volumes in NF1 compared to controls. FXS was associated with increased whole brain, and gray and white matter volumes relative to controls, but effect sizes were smaller than those seen in NF1. In contrast, studies in NS indicated smaller whole brain and gray matter volumes, and reduced subcortical volumes compared to controls. For individuals with TSC, there were no significant differences in whole brain, gray matter, and white volumes compared to controls. Volumetric effect sizes were not moderated by age, sex, or full-scale IQ. This meta-analysis revealed that dysregulation of mTOR signaling across pre- and post-natal periods of development can result in convergent and divergent consequences for brain volume among genetic syndromes. Further research employing advanced disease modeling techniques with human pluripotent stem cell-derived in vitro models is needed to further refine our understanding of between and within syndrome variability on early brain development and identify shared molecular mechanisms for the development of pharmaceutical interventions."

    "title": "Fatal abdominal hemorrhage following surgery to remove a retroperitoneal MPNST associated with NF1: A case report.",
    "abstract": "Individuals diagnosed with neurofibromatosis type I (NF1) commonly present with neurofibromas, and a subset may progress to develop malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) during their lifetime. Diagnosing and treating MPNST, typically linked to NF1, poses challenges for clinicians due to its histopathological complexity. A 25-year-old male presented with postprandial discomfort and vomiting, subsequently developing left mid-abdominal pain. The patient was admitted to the hospital, where a low-density retroperitoneal mass was detected via computed tomography (CT). Histopathological examination revealed spindle-shaped tumor cells characterized by abundant cytoplasm and highly pigmented nuclei, demonstrating pathological nuclear division. The tumor cells exhibited partial cytoplasmic positive for S-100 and focal cytoplasmic positive for cytokeratin (CK) and desmin, as determined by immunohistochemical staining. Genetic analysis of blood and extracted tissues identified an NF1 missense mutation. Prior research corroborated the pathological diagnosis of MPNST exhibiting both epithelial and myogenic differentiation. A retroperitoneal mass excision was conducted, revealing a mass located in the retroperitoneal omental sac. Approximately 5 hours after surgery, the patient's blood pressure exhibited a gradual decline. An emergency laparotomy was conducted. Approximately 3000 mL of blood was identified in the upper abdominal cavity. The patient's blood pressure consistently declined and ultimately resulted in death after 2 days. It is crucial to assess the potential for heterogeneous differentiation in MPNST during pathological diagnosis. In the treatment of MPNST with heterogeneous differentiation, particularly in cases with significant tumor bulk, surgeons must anticipate potential hemorrhagic complications and adopt a cautious approach to surgical intervention."

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a genetic condition characterized by various somatic manifestations and cognitive impairments, but the latter are sparsely described in adults. This study aimed at characterizing potential impairments of neurocognitive functions using neuropsychological tests as well as a self-report questionnaire. In a nationwide, population-based study including 103 adults with NF1 and 38 age- and gender-matched NF1-free comparisons, we used a comprehensive neurocognitive test battery to assess intelligence and visual short-term memory, immediate visuospatial recall, reaction time, sustained attention, motor speed, planning, planning time, working memory as well as multitasking and a questionnaire to assess executive functions. Descriptive statistics, multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA), and general linear models with repeated measure analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used. We observed a statistically significant difference in overall performance-based cognitive functioning. Adults with NF1 showed significant, moderate-to-severe impairments in intelligence, visual short-term memory, immediate visuospatial recall, sustained attention (p < 0.0001-0.002), and some executive functions (p = 0.008 - 0.001), whereas other cognitive functions (multitasking, reaction time, motor speed, spatial working memory, planning time, and planning efficacy as well as some self-reported executive functions) were unimpaired. This is the first study with a population-based sample of persons with NF1 and the results show impairments of intelligence and other cognitive functions. The pattern of both significant cognitive impairments and non-significantly different cognitive functions suggests a cognitive profile of selective rather than generalized cognitive deficits in NF1."

    "abstract": "Moyamoya syndrome (MMS) is a subset of moyamoya disease (MMD) with a systemic comorbidity. Due to the lack of direct comparisons between various MMS subgroups and their MMD counterparts, we aimed to analyze differences in stroke-related outcomes between MMS subgroups and patients with MMD through propensity score matching (PSM). We analyzed the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) from 2011 to 2020 for patients with MMD and common MMS-related comorbidities: Down syndrome (DS), sickle-cell disease (SCD), and type 1 neurofibromatosis (NF1). PSM was performed to match patients of each MMS subgroup to patients with MMD only, controlling for stroke risk factors. Rates of ischemic strokes, hemorrhagic strokes, and transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) were evaluated after matching. A total of 10,652 patients with a moyamoya diagnosis were identified: 7971 with MMD only, 2202 with MMS-SCD, 162 with MMS-NF1, and 317 with MMS-DS. PSM for MMD only and MMS-SCD resulted in 630 matched pairs. After matching, univariate analysis showed that patients with MMS-SCD had significantly lower rates of ischemic strokes (8.9% vs. 17.9%; P = 0.001), hemorrhagic strokes (5.1% vs. 8.1%; P = 0.031), and TIAs (2.2% vs. 4.6%; P = 0.020) than did patients with MMD only. For the MMS-DS subgroup, 92 matched pairs showed significantly lower rates of TIAs than did patients with MMD only (0% vs. 6.5%; P = 0.013). Comparing 54 matched pairs of patients with MMD only and patients with MMS-NF1 showed no significant differences in stroke-related outcomes. Patients with MMS-SCD had significantly lower rates of acute ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, and TIA compared with patients with MMD only. Future research should consider the source of these differences in improving stroke prevention in patients with MMD."

This study describes the diagnosis, clinical characterization, management, and outcomes of a large patient cohort with plexiform neurofibroma (PN) treated with selumetinib in a real-world clinical setting. This single-center observational study consecutively enrolled patients with NF1-PN treated with selumetinib from April 2018 to 2023. Data on clinical features, tumor types and locations, and results from genetic tests were recorded at baseline; details of disease management with selumetinib and surgical intervention and disease evolution including imaging data and evaluations of pain and function were documented. Overall, 54 patients with a median age (range) of 16.4 (4.5-58.0) years were enrolled. Most had cutaneous manifestations (88.9%), including cutaneous neurofibromas and PN. Patients underwent [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET/CT imaging before treatment to rule out malignant lesions. Initial evaluations included directed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which facilitated future comparisons and allowed for the assessment of PN resectability. Pharmacological treatment with selumetinib (with surgery, without surgery) resulted in the following proportion of patients achieving stable disease (58.8%, 54.3%), partial response (29.4%, 28.6%), and improved pain (58.8%, 37.1%), deformity (17.6%, 20.0%), and functional (17.6%, 20.0%) outcomes, respectively. Results from this study demonstrate that NF1-PN can be managed effectively with selumetinib with surgical intervention in some patients. Most patients achieved tumor stability and improved symptom control, and the majority of patients continue under treatment. Effective diagnosis and management were achieved through individualized utility of FDG-PET/CT and MRI imaging and targeted resource allocation."

    "abstract": "Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) development is characterized by an altered DNA methylation landscape, which presents a promising area for developing MPNST-specific biomarkers for screening patients with NF1. Genome-wide DNA methylation profiling of a cohort of 13 patients with MPNST (29 samples of tumor and adjacent neurofibroma tissues) and of NF1-MPNST cell lines was performed to identify and validate candidate MPNST-specific CpG sites (CpGs). A logistic regression prediction model was constructed to select MPNST-specific CpGs distinct from adjacent neurofibromas and normal tissues. To test if hypermethylation at selected CpGs can also be detected in plasma from patients with MPNST, cfMBD-seq was applied to profile the cfDNA methylome of blood from patients with MPNST and NF1. Based on stringent feature-selection criteria and predictive modeling, we identified 73 candidate MPNST-specific CpGs (67 with unique CpG island locations) that reliably discriminated MPNSTs from neurofibromas. Validation of five candidate biomarkers confirmed successful MPNST detection (sensitivity: > 88%, specificity: > 91%) in tissues. In plasma samples, 63 of 67 selected genomic regions had greater than 1.2-fold higher methylation in patients with MPNST than those with NF1. Further, we identified 15 CpG islands that consistently separated plasma from patients with confirmed MPNST diagnosis from plasma of individuals with NF1 without a diagnosis of malignant transformation (FDR < 0.1). Our findings confirmed a unique hypermethylation pattern present during malignant transformation. This study highlights the potential to be investigated further as biomarkers in clinical settings for early MPNST detection in patients with NF1."

    "abstract": "This retrospective observational study aimed to investigate the perioperative outcome in Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumors (MPNSTs) with and without relation to Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) and to detect possible influencing factors. Clinical reports, histopathological evaluations, imaging, and treatment characteristics were reviewed in 35 operated MPNSTs in 33 patients. Possible predictive valuables included disease type, preoperative tumor volume, SUV and MIB-1 proliferation index, resection margins, the presence of metastasis, and whether radio-/chemotherapy was received. Patients with NF1 were younger (mean age: 29 ± 13, 8-54 years) than sporadic cases (mean age: 45 ± 13, 24-67 years) and exhibited significantly larger preoperative tumor volumes (mean 299 vs. 18 cm<sup>3</sup>, <i>p</i> = 0.048). Most tumors were located in the facial/cervical/neck area (34%, n = 12), followed by the trunk (31%, n = 11), lower extremity (17%, n = 6), upper extremity (14%, n = 5), and intraspinal area (3%, n = 1). NF1-associated MPNSTs appeared predominantly on the trunk (39%) and sporadically in the facial/cervical/neck area (50%). Complete resection was possible in 66% and an improvement in or stability of function was achieved in most cases (motor 69%, sensory 74%), as well as a decrease in pain intensity (63%). NF1-associated MPNSTs exhibited more severe pain scores (median VRS scale 2, <i>p</i> = 0.002) compared to sporadic tumors (median VRS scale 0.5). Sporadic MPNSTs located at the head/facial/brachial plexus and upper extremities exhibited better preoperative functions compared to those on the lower extremities. In 12 cases with available [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG PET, the mean preoperative SUV (9.8 ± 7.2) positively correlated with the mean maximum MIB-1 index (34 ± 26%, <i>p</i> = 0.005) and the mean preoperative tumor volume (474.7 ± 68.6 cm<sup>3</sup>, <i>p</i> = 0.047). The overall survival (OS) was significantly longer in tumors with higher resection extents (R0, <i>p</i> = 0.01) and without accompanying metastasis (<i>p</i> = 0.046), and tended to be longer, but not significantly so, in sporadic MPNSTs. In six and seven tumors, with R1/R2 resection margins and present metastasis, respectively, solid or combined neo-/adjuvant radio-/chemotherapy led to a significantly shorter OS (<i>p</i> = 0.014). NF1-associated MPNSTs have larger tumor volumes, higher SUVs and MIB-1 proliferation indices, and a shorter overall survival period. Nevertheless, surgery can improve symptoms, particularly medication-resistant pain, and should also be considered in advanced disease for symptom control/improvement."

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) presents with a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations, including an increased risk of tumor development and hypertension. Comprehensive data on genotype‒phenotype correlations in patients with NF1 are limited. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to elucidate the detailed genetic and clinical characteristics of NF1 in a hereditary tumor cohort. We performed sequencing and copy number assays in a clinical laboratory and analyzed the clinical data of 44 patients with suspected NF1. Germline pathogenic variants were detected in 36 patients (81.8%), and 20.7% of the variants were novel. Notably, 40.0% of adult patients presented with malignancies; female breast cancer occurred in 20.0% of patients, which was a higher rate than that previously reported. Hypertension was observed in 30.6% of the adult patients, with one patient experiencing sudden death and another developing pheochromocytoma. Three patients with large deletions in NF1 exhibited prominent cutaneous, skeletal, and neurological manifestations. These results highlight the importance of regular surveillance, particularly for patients with malignancies and hypertension. Our findings provide valuable insights for genetic counseling and clinical management, highlighting the multiple health risks associated with NF1 and the need for comprehensive and multidisciplinary care."

    "abstract": "Individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1 and schwannomatosis (NF) often face difficult reproductive choices when family planning; however, their experiences and the barriers and enablers to reproductive decision-making are poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to explore the opinions and experiences of individuals with NF in Australia and inform the development of practice recommendations and resources. Focus groups with adults with NF were conducted using a semi-structured interview schedule developed by the research team. Partners were also invited. The focus groups were recorded, de-identified, transcribed, and analyzed using codebook thematic analysis. Three focus groups were conducted with 17 participants (12 = NF1, 4 = NF2-related schwannomatosis [NF2-SWN] and one partner). Three themes were identified: (1) Barriers and enablers; (2) Contemplating the options; and (3) Education and support needs. Barriers to reproductive decision-making included: difficulty accessing healthcare services to discuss reproductive planning; a lack of access to reliable information sources and support; and, in some cases, the financial cost of assistive reproductive technology. Conversely, positive healthcare experiences and support systems enabled reproductive choices. Participants reported many factors that contributed to their reproductive decisions, including: their personal experience of their condition; concern about their future health and that of an affected child; the impact of pregnancy on their health; and the opinion of healthcare providers, family, and friends. Many participants reported mental health difficulties related to their condition and additional stressors related to the reproductive journey. Participants' recommendations included increased access to healthcare services to discuss reproductive options, the development of comprehensive information resources, and improved psychological and peer support for individuals with NF considering family planning and, where relevant, their partners. In conclusion, people with NF and their partners identify a need for improved awareness of NF among healthcare professionals and increased access to appropriate services, information, and support to facilitate informed reproductive decision-making."

We aimed to determine the incidence, tumor characteristics, management, and outcome of NETs and explore the role of genetic predisposition, focusing on low and intermediate grade tumors. Using the Danish National Pathology Registry, we conducted a nationwide retrospective study including all Danish children aged ≤18 years diagnosed with a pathology-proven NET between 1995 and 2020. We identified 220 patients, with a 1.89:1 female to male ratio. The yearly incidence was 6.84 per 1 million children, with no significant change in incidence throughout the observation period. NETs were located in the appendix (93.2%), the pulmonary system (4.5%), and pancreas (2.3%). One recurrence was noted in the pancreas in a genetically predisposed patient with multiple neuroendocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1), resulting in an overall recurrence rate of 0.5% (0% in appendiceal NETs; 0% in bronchopulmonary NETs; 20.0% in pancreatic NETs). No NET-related mortality was registered. Four patients had a known predisposing genetic condition, one appendiceal NET associated with neurofibromatosis type 1, and three pancreatic NETs associated with MEN1. Postsurgical surveillance regimes, choice of tumor markers, and imaging modality varied throughout the study period. We confirmed a stable incidence of pediatric NETs during the study period. The overall recurrence rate was 0.5% and no NET-related mortality was observed. Known genetic predisposition was present in 1.8% of patients. Future guidelines should consider the apparent indolent nature and excellent prognosis of these tumors."

We report a case of a 30-year-old Rag-lay ethnic woman with facial plexiform neurofibroma, which not only infiltrated the left eye socket but also caused destruction of temporal bone and facial deformity. The disease started in her childhood, and she had numerous neurofibromas on her trunk and limb at the time of the hospital admission. The patient was diagnosed with neurofibromatosis 1 based on clinical symptoms, computed tomography images, and histopathologic result. For safety, we divided treatment into two phases. For the first phase, we dealt with the blood supply and meningeal suture, and then we performed surgical resection and skin flap reconstruction surgery. The main therapy for plexiform neurofibroma is surgery, which aims at tumor removal and management of complications. However, the treatment plan is different in each case based on the nature and extent of tumor, which requires more verification and clinical practice."

    "abstract": "Adrenocortical tumors (ACTs) are frequently encountered in clinical practice. They vary in clinical and biological characteristics from nonfunctional to life threatening hormone excess, from benign to highly aggressive malignant tumors. Most ACTs appear to be benign and nonfunctioning. It has been controversial how these apparently benign and nonfunctioning tumors should be monitored. Over the past few decades, significant advances have been made in understanding the regulation of growth and tumorigenesis in adrenocortical cells. Defining the molecular pathomechanisms in inherited tumor syndromes led to the expansion of research to sporadic ACTs. Distinct molecular signatures have been identified in sporadic ACTs and a potential genomic classification of ACT has been proposed. In this review, we discuss the various adrenocortical pathologies associated with hereditary syndromes with special focus on their molecular pathomechanisms, the understanding of which is important in the era of precision medicine. Identifying the molecular pathomechanisms of the adrenocortical tumorigenesis in inherited syndromes has led to the understanding of the alterations in different signaling pathways that help explain the wide variations in the biology and behavior of ACTs."

Surgical intervention is the treatment of choice to avoid neurological impairment and malalignment. We herein report an 11-year-old NF-1 patient with severe cervical kyphosis and intact neurological status. We applied five days of cervical traction followed by surgery utilizing the combined cervical approach (posterior release, anterior corpectomy and reconstruction, and posterior cervicothoracic instrumentation). In one-year follow-up, atlantoaxial dislocation (AAD) and basilar invagination (BI) were detected in neuroimagings. The complication was corrected by adding C1 to the previous construct via unilateral C1 lateral mass screw, contralateral C1 sublaminar hook, unilateral C3 and contralateral C4 sublaminar hook insertion, fixed with contoured rods medial to previous rods. This led to the correction of the AAD and the BI and the patients remained neurologically intact. Severe cervical kyphosis in the setting of NF-1 is progressive and carries a considerable risk of neurologic compromise. Surgical intervention is thus necessary. The combined approach with complete spinal column reconstruction is the surgical approach of choice. However, complete curve correction to near-normal lordosis carries the risk of proximal junctional failure (PJF)."

Although gastrointestinal manifestations, such as neurofibromas and gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), can occur, appendiceal neurofibromas are extremely rare, with no documented cases of their occurrence following other gastrointestinal lesions. Herein, we report a case of an appendiceal neurofibroma following the resection of multiple small intestinal GISTs. A 68-year-old man with NF1 presented with melena and was diagnosed with anemia due to bleeding from multiple small intestinal GISTs. Laparoscopic three partial resection of the small intestine was performed to control the bleeding. Histopathologic examination revealed the proliferation of spindle cells that are positive for c-kit and Discovered on GIST-1, confirming the diagnosis of GIST. Two years later, a follow-up computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a progressively enlarging mass in the appendix with suspected invasion into the small intestine. Positron emission tomography/CT showed fludeoxyglucose accumulation in the tumor. Therefore, considering the possibility of malignancy, laparoscopic ileocecal resection with lymph node dissection was performed. Postoperatively, melena was observed, but the anemia did not progress and improved with fasting and hemostatic therapy. The patient was eventually discharged on postoperative day 8. Histopathologic examination revealed spindle cell proliferation with positivity for S-100, confirming the diagnosis of neurofibroma. Patients with NF1 can develop a variety of gastrointestinal lesions. Appendiceal neurofibroma can be difficult to diagnose preoperatively and differentiate from malignancy. Hence, surgical resection should be considered."

We have performed an analysis of disease severity, mental and physical QoL and compare the different subclasses among patients with neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1). We conducted a prospective analysis of 89 NF1 patients between January 2016 and March 2018. Data sourced from local records including demographic information, employment status, education level, and marital status. All patients completed 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) and additionally the numerical pain rating scale (NPS). Patients were stratified based on severity of NF1, visibility and disease severity. Among 89 patients, severity was classified as grade 4 was identified in 42 (47.2%), moderate in 17 (19.1%), mild in 23 (25.8%) and minimal in 7 (7.9%) cases. According to visibility scale, severe grade 3 was found in 28 (31.5%), moderate grade 2 in 26 (29.2%) and mild grade in 35 (39.3%) cases. SF-36 data, except for pain, showed significantly lower values, if compared to the standard German population (<i>P</i> < 0.001, physical component summary <i>P</i> = 0.045). Sex, marital status and education level did not significantly influence results. Employment was significantly associated with better mental and physical status (<i>P</i> = 0.028 and <i>P</i> = 0.01 respectively) and age >40 was linked to lower physical (<i>P</i> = 0.027) but not mental component scores (<i>P</i> = 0.362). The numerical pain rating scale indicated pain levels of 7-10 in 9 cases (10,1%), 5-6 in 10 patients (11.2%), 1-4 in 26 patients (29.2%) and no pain in 44 cases (49.4%). Physical component scores significantly differed across different NPS grades (<i>P</i> < 0.001) but not in mental component scores (P = 0.06). Finally, no significant differences were found in mental component scores across severity or visibility grades. Severity and visibility grades of patients with NF1 may not necessarily result in poor mental health. Symptomatic treatment should be considered even for severely disabled patients as they may have comparable QoL to less severely affected patients with NF1. Employment was linked to better quality of life outcomes in our findings."

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder, whose clinical picture is dominated by visible body changes as well as numerous somatic and behavioural abnormalities. The aim of the study was to explore the ways in which the individual experiences NF1 in everyday life, with particular emphasis on the impact of the altered body on family interactions, in addition to the personal and social identity of individuals with NF1. A qualitative study was performed using individual in-depth interviews with 93 individuals with NF1 (median age: 36.69; range: 18 to 64; 26% males). Body changes caused by NF1 determine the specificity of social interactions in the families of the sick. The strength and direction of the impact of body changes on social interactions depends on their type (visibility, invisibility), as well as the meanings given to them. The visibility of disease lesions triggers an attitude of excessive control and stigmatization in the family, especially on the part of the mothers of individuals with NF1, and prompts a tendency to define the individual through the prism of the disease and its bodily manifestations. In turn, the lack of visibility of disease symptoms gives rise to, especially on the part of the fathers of the sick, opposing attitudes of disease denial, normalization of its symptoms and a tendency to question the disease identity of individuals with NF1. The great intensity of interactional problems concerns especially those families in which NF1 was transmitted through inheritance, and family members blame each other for the disease. This leads to repression and denial of the disease, excluding it from the scope of issues discussed in the family, which is an attempt to avoid the attribution of blame for the disease. The body changes resulting from NF1 have social consequences that are of critical importance in the lives of the sick. The impact of NF1 on family interactions depends on the ways in which the disease is understood by the sick individual and his or her family members. The obtained patient-driven data constitute a convenient starting point for designing personalized interventions supporting individuals with NF1 and their families."

    "title": "Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumour Presenting as Sciatica in a Patient with Neurofibromatosis Type 1: Is Magnetic Resonance Imaging an Effective Screening Tool?",
    "abstract": "Peripheral malignant nerve sheath tumours (MPNST) are rare and aggressive soft tissue sarcomas often associated with neurofibromatosis type I (NF-1). We describe a case of 26-year-old female with NF-1, initially misdiagnosed as sciatica, who was later found to have a malignant spindle cell peripheral nerve sheath tumour of the right sciatic nerve. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) proved to be a valuable tool for diagnosis. This case illustrates the importance of considering the transformation of neurofibromas into MPNST as a potential cause of worsening neuropathic pain in patients with NF-1. Given the overlap in clinical presentation with benign conditions, we analyse the utility of MRI for early screening for. Early detection is crucial to improve the chances of cure and prolonged disease-free survival. Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours can occur in patients with neurofibromatosis and present as sciatica.Magnetic resonance imaging screening should be considered early on in this patient population."

    "title": "Germline mismatch repair gene mutations in children with tumors: a case series from two centers.",
    "abstract": "Mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency can lead to constitutional mismatch repair deficiency (CMMRD) syndrome and Lynch syndrome (LS). These two genetic disorders are associated with a broad spectrum of tumor types, including a variety of brain tumors. Usually, tumors associated with LS are more common in adults and rarely occur in children. The characterizations of café-au-lait macules (CALMs) are relatively similar in CMMRD syndrome and neurofibromatosis type 1 (<i>NF1</i>), which often causes difficulties in the diagnosis of CMMRD syndrome. We identified five patients with MMR gene germline mutations and tumors from the University of Hong Kong - Shenzhen Hospital (four cases) and Hong Kong Children's Hospital (one case) within a 2-year period (June 2021 to June 2023). The clinical features of these patients were reviewed and compared with those detailed in the literature. Of the four patients with CMMRD syndrome, two had medulloblastomas, one had low-grade glioma, and one had desmoid fibromatosis. The only LS patient was diagnosed with medulloblastoma at the age of 10. In terms of the gene mutations of the CMMRD syndrome patients, two had the <i>MSH6</i> mutation (one of whom had the <i>de novo</i> mutation), one patient had the <i>MLH1</i> mutation, and no known genetic mutation was detected in the other patient. The LS patient had the <i>MSH2</i> mutation. Three of the four CMMRD syndrome (75%) patients and the one LS patient had a positive family history of malignancy. Currently, the origin and mechanism of <i>de novo</i> mutations in the MMR gene that cause CMMRD syndrome and LS remain elusive. In this study, all the four CMMRD syndrome patients had CALMs since birth, but no further follow up or clinical surveillance was performed until their tumors developed. We summarized several CALM-related genetic syndromes and highlighted their differences in terms of the clinical features. This could facilitate the differentiation of the different types of CALM-associated hereditary syndromes and help to reduce delays in diagnosis. More than half of CMMRD syndrome and LS patients have no family history of cancer; thus, the absence of a positive family history does not rule out CMMRD syndrome and LS. A better diagnostic approach is to perform genetic testing to rule out the risk as early as possible when a newborn presents with cafe-au-lait spots, which are a typical feature of hereditary syndromes. Therefore, it is important to use germline genetic testing, combined with clinical phenotypic observation, to establish a diagnosis of a cancer susceptibility syndrome caused by an MMR gene mutation."

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common neurocutaneous syndrome that predisposes patients to seizures. We aimed to estimate the prevalence, clinical characteristics and outcomes of seizures in NF1 patients, and analyze prognostic factors of seizures. Systematic searches were conducted in the PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Scopus, Cochrane Library, and grey literature databases from inception to April 2024. We identified observational studies that included NF1 patients with seizures. Clinical characteristics of seizures were summarized and meta-analyses of prevalence and outcomes were conducted. We assessed publication bias using funnel plots and conducted sensitivity analysis to assess stability and reliability. Individual patient data were analyzed to evaluate prognostic factors. Fourteen studies were identified from 1021 records. A total of 337 patients with seizures from 4946 NF1 patients were included. Meta-analysis indicated the overall prevalence of seizures in NF1 patients was 8.1 % (95 % CI= 5.9-10.3 %). The first seizure usually occurs in childhood, with a median age range of 3.5-12.0 years. Focal seizures (54.2 %) and generalized tonic-clonic seizures (16.8 %) were the most common types. The seizure freedom rate was 68.5 % (95 % CI= 57.5-79.5 %), mostly with one or two antiseizure medications. Cortical malformation/hippocampus sclerosis emerged as an independent risk factor for persistent seizures (OR=5.19, 95 %CI=1.27-21.18, P=0.02). Though NF1 patients face a higher risk of seizures than the general population, the majority achieve seizure freedom. Patients with cortical malformation or hippocampus sclerosis were at a higher risk of persistent seizures."

To address this challenge, we developed GINtoSPN, an R package that automates the conversion of multi-omics molecular interaction network extracted from the Global Integrative Network (GIN) into Petri nets in GraphML format. These GraphML files can be directly used for Signaling Petri Net (SPN) simulation. To demonstrate the utility of this tool, we built a Petri net model for neurofibromatosis type I. Simulation of NF1 gene knockout, compared to normal skin fibroblast cells, revealed persistent accumulation of Ras-GTPs as expected. Additionally, we identified several other genes substantially affected by the loss of NF1's function, exhibiting individual-specific variability. These results highlight the effectiveness of GINtoSPN in streamlining the modeling and simulation of complex biological systems."

ReNeu is an open-label, multicenter, pivotal, phase IIb trial of mirdametinib in 58 adults (≥18 years of age) and 56 children (2 to 17 years of age) with NF1-PN causing significant morbidities. Patients received mirdametinib capsules or tablets for oral suspension (2 mg/m<sup>2</sup> twice daily, maximum 4 mg twice daily), regardless of food intake, in 3 weeks on/1 week off 28-day cycles. The primary end point was confirmed objective response rate (ORR; proportion of patients with a ≥20% reduction of target PN volume from baseline on consecutive scans during the 24-cycle treatment phase) assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR) of volumetric magnetic resonance imaging. Twenty-four of 58 adults (41%) and 29 of 56 children (52%) had a BICR-confirmed objective response during the 24-cycle treatment phase; in addition, two adults and one child had confirmed responses during long-term follow-up. Median (range) target PN volumetric best response was -41% (-90 to 13) in adults and -42% (-91 to 48) in children. Both cohorts reported significant and clinically meaningful improvement in patient- or parent proxy-reported outcome measures of worst tumor pain severity, pain interference, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) that began early and were sustained during treatment. The most commonly reported treatment-related adverse events were dermatitis acneiform, diarrhea, and nausea in adults and dermatitis acneiform, diarrhea, and paronychia in children. In ReNeu, the largest multicenter NF1-PN trial reported to date, mirdametinib treatment demonstrated significant confirmed ORRs by BICR, deep and durable PN volume reductions, and early, sustained, and clinically meaningful improvement in pain and HRQOL.

    "abstract": "With no more than two dozen cases reported in the literature, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) is a rare primary mesenchymal neoplasm arising in the female genital tract. Most cases occurred in middle-aged adults with high grade histology, unfavorable clinical outcome, and no history of neurofibromatosis type 1. Its extreme rarity in this site no doubt poses a diagnostic challenge during routine clinical practice. In the following, we report an additional case of uterine MPNST occurring in a 49-year-old Chinese woman, which was initially misdiagnosed as a leiomyosarcoma. The primary tumor showed two distinctive components-a high-grade poorly differentiated component with markedly pleomorphic spindle cells arranged in a peritheliomatous pattern; and a leiomyosarcoma-like (LMS-like) component with tumor cells displaying obvious myoid differentiation. The patient suffered a recurrence less than 2 years later with the recurrent tumor demonstrating similar features to the high-grade component of the primary tumor. The patient eventually succumbed 46 months later after developing another recurrence despite receiving targeted therapy and chemotherapy. On retrospective molecular analysis, no clinically relevant fusion transcript was detected on RNA sequencing. Interestingly instead, DNA methylation analysis showed the tumor clustered with the \"MPNST\" group in the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) sarcoma classifier. The tumor was also found to have EED gene homozygous deletion, multiple copy number alterations and loss of H3K27me3 expression in both high-grade and LMS-like components. Combining histology with all the ancillary tests results, the diagnosis was most consistent with MPNST. Our case highlights the diagnostic pitfalls for MPNST arising in the female genital tract and the potential clinical utility of DNA methylation analysis."

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) is the most common neurocutaneous disorder in the United States. Due to a nonfunctional mutation in the NF1 gene, the disorder may initially present with café-au-lait spots and later numerous neurofibromas across the body. Epilepsy is a rare comorbidity of NF1, with an incidence of just 4%-7%. While abnormal electroencephalograms have been seen in up to 25% of NF1 patients, very few studies have investigated the association between epilepsy and the NF1 patient profile. This study was aimed at evaluating the associations between epilepsy and demographics, comorbidities and healthcare outcomes in NF1 patients. The 2017 National Inpatient Sample (NIS) database was retrospectively queried for patients with NF1 using ICD-10 PCS codes. Chi-square tests were used in univariable analysis to compare patients within this cohort with and without epilepsy. Regression analysis was used in multivariable analysis to identify comorbidities that were predictors of epilepsy and the effect of comorbidities on outcomes. 4635 patients with NF1 were identified, of which 655 (14.1%) had epilepsy and 3980 (85.9%) did not. The NF1 patient population with epilepsy was largely comprised of White males of lower household income in larger urban/teaching hospitals and who used Medicare or Medicaid. Multivariable logistic regression revealed that malignant brain neoplasms, paralytic ileus, scoliosis, pregnancy complications, paralysis, other neurological disorders, metastatic cancer, coagulopathy, drug abuse and hypertension were predictors of developing epilepsy in NF1 patients. Additionally, epilepsy in NF1 patients was associated with a shorter length of stay, lower total charges and fewer total procedures."

However, given the shift in diagnostic pathology toward the use of integrated histopathologic and genomic approaches, the incorporation of additional molecular strata in the classification of Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1)-associated peripheral nerve sheath tumors should be formalized to aid in accurate diagnosis and early identification of malignant transformation and enable appropriate intervention for affected patients. To this end, we assembled a multi-institutional expert pathology working group as part of a \"Symposium on Atypical Neurofibroma: State of the Science.\" Herein, we provide a suggested framework for adequate interventional radiology and surgical sampling and recommend molecular profiling for clinically or radiologically worrisome noncutaneous lesions in patients with NF1 to identify diagnostically-relevant molecular features, including CDKN2A/B inactivation for ANNUBP, as well as SUZ12, EED, or TP53 inactivating mutations, or significant aneuploidy for MPNST. We also propose renaming \"low-grade MPNST\" to \"ANNUBP with increased proliferation\" to avoid the use of the \"malignant\" term in this group of tumors with persistent unknown biologic potential. This refined integrated diagnostic approach for NF1-associated peripheral nerve sheath tumors should continue to evolve in concert with our understanding of these neoplasms."

Positron emission tomography-computed tomography revealed a large pelvic mass and lung and bone metastases. Biopsy confirmed MPNST. Immunohistochemical staining showed diffuse positivity for CD10, approximately 30% positivity for cyclin D1, partial positivity for α-SMA, desmin, and MyoD1, and negativity for myogenin, S-100, and SOX-10. A cancer gene panel identified several genetic abnormalities, but none were actionable mutations. Despite systemic chemotherapy, the tumor progressed rapidly, and the patient died 8 weeks post-admission. Early diagnosis of MPNST is crucial. In patients with NF1, even mild symptoms can indicate MPNST."

    "abstract": "Patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) can develop plexiform neurofibromas (PN). Large tumor burden is a predictor for the development of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors. Whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (WB-MRI) is the recommended imaging method for the evaluation of PN. WB-MRI is recommended for NF1 patients at transition from adolescence to adulthood. In the absence of internal PN further follow-up WB-MRI is not considered necessary. PN are often detected in early childhood, leading to the assumption that they may be congenital lesions. It remains unclear whether this invariably applies to all patients or whether patients who initially displayed no tumors can still develop PN over time. Therefore, we retrospectively reviewed WB-MRI scans of pediatric patients with NF1 without initial tumor burden and compared these with long-term follow-up scans for presence of newly developed PN. We retrospectively reviewed WB-MRI scans of 17 NF1-children (twelve male; median age at initial scan: 9 [IQR 6.1-11.9] years) who initially displayed no PN. MRI scans with a follow-up interval of at least 6 years (median follow-up interval: 9 [IQR 5.6-12.4] years) were reviewed in consensus by two radiologists regarding the development of new PN over time. New PN were identified in two out of 17 children without initial tumor burden in follow-up examinations. One of these two patients developed two larger distinct PN of 4.5 cm on the right upper arm and of 2.5 cm on the left thoracic wall between the age of ten and twelve. The second child developed multiple smaller PN along the major peripheral nerves between the age of eleven and 16. In addition, 15 of the children without initial tumor burden did not develop any distinct tumors for a period of at least 6 years. Our results indicate that PN can be newly detected in pediatric patients over time, even if no PN were detected on initial MRI scans. Therefore, it seems reasonable to perform at least a second MRI in pediatric NF1 patients at transition to adulthood, even if they did not display any tumor burden on initial MRI, and when the MRI was performed significantly under the age of 18. With this approach, tumors that may have developed between scans can be detected and patients at risk for complications can be identified."

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common inherited neurological disorder that can lead to the development of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), a highly aggressive form of sarcoma. Current treatment options for MPNSTs are limited, with poor prognosis and high recurrence rates. This study aims to explore the potential of targeting the Galectin-1 (Gal-1) and Ras interaction as a novel therapeutic strategy for MPNSTs. Molecular docking simulations were conducted to identify specific residues involved in the Gal-1 and H-Ras(G12V) interaction. LLS30, a compound designed to target the Ras binding pocket on Gal-1, was developed and tested. The efficacy of LLS30 was evaluated through in vitro assays, including cell viability, apoptosis, and co-immunoprecipitation studies, as well as in vivo assays using orthotopic MPNST xenograft and experimental lung metastasis models. Transcriptome sequencing was performed to analyze the impact of LLS30 on gene expression and signaling pathways. Molecular docking revealed key residues involved in the Gal-1/Ras interaction, and LLS30 was shown to bind to these residues, disrupting the interaction. LLS30 treatment resulted in Ras delocalization from the plasma membrane and suppression of the Ras/Erk signaling pathway. <i>In vitro</i>, LLS30 significantly reduced MPNST cell proliferation and induced apoptosis. <i>In vivo</i>, LLS30 demonstrated potent anti-tumor activity, reducing tumor burden and metastasis while improving survival in animal models. Transcriptome analysis showed that LLS30 downregulates critical pathways, including KRAS signaling and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Interference with the Gal-1/Ras interaction could lead to suppression of the Ras signaling pathway. LLS30 effectively disrupts the Gal-1/Ras interaction, resulting in significant anti-tumor and anti-metastatic effects in MPNST models. These findings indicated that targeting Gal-1 with LLS30 offers a promising therapeutic approach for treating MPNSTs and may also be applicable to other malignancies where Gal-1 and Ras are key oncogenic drivers."

    "abstract": "Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are highly aggressive Schwann cell-derived sarcomas that are sporadic or associated with Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) gene mutations. Traditional therapies are usually ineffective for treating MPNSTs, so new targets need to be identified for the treatment of MPNSTs. In the present study, the role of the mitochondrial translocator protein (TSPO) in the regulation of cell proliferation and the cell cycle in MPNSTs was investigated. TSPO expression was lower in MPNSTs than in NFs. Loss-of-function experiments revealed that TSPO deficiency promoted MPNST cell growth, migration, and invasion and influenced the cell cycle in vitro and in vivo. In addition, TSPO depletion suppressed cell apoptosis by downregulating the expression of caspase-3, caspase-8, HSP60, p27, p53, and BCL-2 and suppressed the cell cycle by upregulating CDK1, CDK2, CCNB1 and CCNA2. Furthermore, CDK1 was determined to be an upstream target of TSPO-mediated regulation via RNA-seq, qPCR, and Western blotting. Specifically, depletion of CDK1 weakened the effect of TSPO deficiency on cell proliferation and migration. More importantly, CDK1 knockdown induced significant cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase. In summary, TSPO deficiency regulates the cell cycle in MPNSTs by targeting CDK1, which may be an effective molecular target for prognosis evaluation and treatment."

This paper synthesizes literature and guidelines to inform on clinical characteristics and perioperative care for PPGL. Pheochromocytoma in von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease exhibits heightened secretion activity without significant perioperative hemodynamic changes. Tumors in multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2) have a stronger endocrine function, which may induce hemodynamic fluctuations during surgery. Therefore, pheochromocytoma screening is essential at all stages of MEN2. Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) often presents multisystem lesions and can result in difficult airway. Pheochromocytoma should be evaluated when NF1 patients present hypertension. Pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma type 5 may present multiple lesions of pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma. In summary, hereditary PPGLs may present with severe lesions in other systems, beyond tumor function. A multi-disciplinary team (MDT) approach is often invaluable in perioperative management."

Diagnosis is often challenging due to the great variability in clinical presentation; the complexity of management due to the dangerous effects of catecholamine excess and the potentially malignant behavior require in-depth knowledge of the pathology and multidisciplinary management. Nowadays, diagnostic ability has certainly improved and guidelines and consensus documents for treatment and follow-up are available. A major impulse to the development of this knowledge has come from the new findings on the genetic and molecular characteristics of PPGLs. Germline mutation in susceptibility genes is detected in 40% of subjects, with a mutation frequency of 10-12% also in patients with sporadic presentation and genetic testing should be incorporated within clinical care. PPGL susceptibility genes include \"old genes\" associated with Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1 gene), Von Hippel Lindau syndrome (VHL gene) and Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia type 2 syndrome (RET gene), the family of SDHx genes (SDHA, SDHB, SDHC, SDHD, SDHAF2), and genes less frequently involved such as TMEM, MAX, and FH. Each gene has a different risk of relapse, malignancy, and other organ involvement; for mutation carriers, affected or asymptomatic, it is possible to define a tailored long-life surveillance program according to the gene involved. In addition, molecular characterization of the tumor has allowed the identification of somatic mutations in other driver genes, bringing to 70% the PPGLs for which we know the mechanisms of tumorigenesis. This has expanded the catalog of tumor driver genes, which are identifiable in up to 70% of patients Integrated genomic and transcriptomic data over the last 10 years have revealed three distinct major molecular signatures, triggered by pathogenic variants in susceptibility genes and characterized by the activation of a specific oncogenic signaling: the pseudo hypoxic, the kinase, and the Wnt signaling pathways. These molecular clusters show a different biochemical phenotype and clinical behavior; they may also represent the prerequisite for implementing customized therapy and follow-up."

    "abstract": "Granular cell tumors (GCT) are predominantly benign neoplasms composed by cells with abundant eosinophilic granular cytoplasm. Although the majority of GCTs exhibit a benign clinical course, a minority display cytological atypia and may exhibit aggressive, cancer-like behavior. Definitive evidence of malignancy in GCTs is reliably established only through the presence of metastasis. Addi- tionally, a subset of GCTs demonstrates a high rate of recurrence, underscoring the need for better prog- nostic markers. Therefore, it is crucial to identify molecular markers associated with aggressive behavior in GCTs. Molecular analysis may be particularly beneficial in cases exhibiting cytological atypia to in- form clinical outcome prognostication and guide therapeutic strategies. In this case report, a 45-year-old female with multiple gastrointestinal GCTs is pre- sented. The patient did not have any genetic syndromes commonly associated with GCT, such as neu- rofibromatosis type 1, Noonan syndrome or LEOPARD syndrome. The tumors not only demonstrated nuclear atypia, but also harbored a unique FLT3 Y842C somatic alteration identified by next-genera- tion sequencing. The patient remains asymptomatic and under endoscopic surveillance two years after diagnosis and complete resection of the neoplasms. We presented an exceedingly rare case of multifocal atypical GCT in an adult without any previously known genetic syndrome. A tumoral FLT3 Y842C point mutation not previously reported in GCT was discovered. Although the precise significance of this finding is uncertain, FLT3 Y842C has been cataloged as likely pathogenic in ClinVar. This report underscores the potential predictive utility of next-generation sequencing in the characterization and management of rare neoplasms."

According to Paley classification, there were 2 cases of type 2a, 2 cases of type 3, 2 cases of type 4a, and 2 cases of type 4c. There were 5 cases of first operation and 3 cases of re-fracture after previous operation. Six cases had leg length discrepancy before operation, and 2 of them had shortening over 2.0 cm. Except for 1 case of ankle fusion, the other 7 cases had ankle valgus. Preoperative coronal/sagittal angulation was recorded. Postoperative pseudarthrosis healing and refracture were observed. Leg length discrepancy and tibiotalar angle were measured and recorded before operation and at last follow-up. Inan imaging evaluation criteria was used to evaluate the imaging effect. All patients were followed up 12-37 months (mean, 23.5 months). One pseudarthrosis failed to heal at 12 months after operation and healed at 3 months after reoperation, while the other pseudarthrosis healed with a healing rate of 87.5% and a healing time of 4-8 months (mean, 5.3 months). No refracture occurred during the follow-up. At last follow-up, there were 2 new cases with leg length discrepancy, which were 0.7 cm and 1.3 cm, respectively. In 2 cases with the leg length discrepancy more than 2.0 cm before operation, the improvement was from 4.1 cm and 12.6 cm to 2.1 cm and 9.0 cm, respectively. There was no significant difference in leg length discrepancy between pre- and post-operation in 8 cases ( <i>P</i>>0.05). At last follow-up, 6 patients still had ankle valgus, and there was no significant difference in the tibiotalar angle between pre- and post-operation ( <i>P</i>>0.05); the tibial coronal/sagittal angulation significantly improved when compared with that before operation ( <i>P</i><0.05). According to Inan imaging evaluation criteria, 1 case was good, 6 cases were fair, and 1 case was poor. Cross-Union surgery is an effective method for the treatment of PT with NF1 in children, can achieve good bone healing results with a low risk of re-fracture. The surgery may not have significant effects on leg length discrepancy and ankle valgus, and further treatment may be required."

    "abstract": "To summarize the treatment strategies and clinical experiences of 5 cases of giant plexiform neurofibromas (PNF) involving the head, face, and neck. Between April 2021 and May 2023, 5 patients with giant PNFs involving the head, face, and neck were treated, including 1 male and 4 females, aged 6-54 years (mean, 22.4 years). All tumors showed progressive enlargement, involving multiple regions such as the maxillofacial area, ear, and neck, significantly impacting facial appearance. Among them, 3 cases involved tumor infiltration into deep tissues, affecting development, while 4 cases were accompanied by hearing loss. Imaging studies revealed that all 5 tumors predominantly exhibited an invasive growth pattern, in which 2 and 1 also presenting superficial and displacing pattern, respectively. The surgical procedure followed a step-by-step precision treatment strategy based on aesthetic units, rather than simply aiming for maximal tumor resection in a single operation. Routine preoperative embolization of the tumor-feeding vessels was performed to reduce bleeding risk, followed by tumor resection combined with reconstructive surgery. All 5 patients underwent 1-3 preoperative embolization procedures, with no intraoperative hemorrhagic complications reported. Four patients required intraoperative blood transfusion. A total of 10 surgical procedures were performed across the 5 patients. One patient experienced early postoperative flap margin necrosis due to ligation for hemostasis; however, the incisions in the remaining patients healed without complications. All patients were followed up for a period ranging from 6 to 36 months, with a mean follow-up duration of 21.6 months. No significant tumor recurrence was observed during the follow-up period. For patients with giant PNF involving the head, face, and neck, precision treatment strategy can effectively control surgical risks and improve the standard of aesthetic reconstruction. This approach enhances overall treatment outcomes by minimizing complications and optimizing functional and cosmetic results."

    "abstract": "To summarize application effect and clinical experience of multimodal intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring (IONM) technology in the surgery of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) related peripheral nerve tumors. A retrospective study was conducted on NF1 patients, who admitted between January 2019 and December 2023 and treated with peripheral nerve tumor resection surgery assisted by multimodal IONM technology. There were 49 males and 45 females. The age ranged from 5 to 78 years, with an average of 33.7 years. Tumor morphological classification included 71 cases of nodular type, 13 cases of diffuse type, and 10 cases of mixed type. Target tumors were distributed in craniofacial region (47 cases), neck (11 cases), trunk (12 cases), and limbs (24 cases). Preoperatively, 44 cases had no obvious neurological symptoms, while the remaining patients had neurological symptoms, including 15 cases of visual impairment, 5 cases of hearing impairment, 16 cases of somatic movement disorders, and 31 cases of somatic sensory disorders, of which 7 cases had more than one symptom. IONM plans were selected based on the relevant nerves and adjacent important structures of the target tumor, including visual evoked potential (17 cases), somatosensory evoked potential (44 cases), motor evoked potential (88 cases), and electromyogram (94 cases). All surgeries were successfully completed. Ninety-three patients underwent total/near total resection and 1 patient underwent palliative resection. Pathological examination showed 80 cases of neurofibroma and 14 cases of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors. Complications included 2 cases of hematoma and 3 cases of incision infection. All patients were followed up 3-61 months (median, 15 months). During follow-up, no significant changes in neurological symptoms or tumor recurrence were found. Among the patients with preoperative visual impairment, there were 14 cases with no improvement in symptoms and 1 with improvement after surgery. Among the patients with somatic movement disorders, there were 11 cases with no improvement in symptoms, 3 cases with improvement, 2 cases with aggravation, 4 newly onset cases, and 1 case with significant impact on daily life after surgery. Among the patients with somatic sensory disorders, there were 17 cases with no improvement in symptoms, 14 cases with improvement, and 13 newly onset cases. The patients with hearing impairment showed improvement after surgery. The clinical manifestations of NF1 related peripheral nerve tumors are complex. Multimodal IONM technology can provide real-time detection of nerve provocation and damage. Surgical treatment with multimodal IONM technology is safe and can reduce complications."

    "abstract": "To investigate the clinical features, treatment methods, and prognostic influence factors of patients with malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST). A retrospective analysis was conducted on 96 MPNST patients treated between January 1, 2015 and December 31, 2021. There were 46 males and 50 females, aged between 15 and 87 years (mean, 48.2 years). The tumors were located in the trunk in 50 cases, extremities in 39 cases, and head and neck in 7 cases. The maximum tumor diameter was <5 cm in 49 cases, ≥5 cm in 32 cases, with 15 cases missing data. Tumor depth was deep in 77 cases and superficial in 19 cases. The Fédération Nationale des Centres de Lutte Contre le Cancer (FNCLCC) histological grading was G1 in 9 cases, G2 in 12 cases, and G3 in 34 cases, with 41 cases missing data. There were 37 recurrent MPNST cases, 32 cases with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), and 26 cases in stage Ⅳ. Postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy was administered to 25 patients, perioperative chemotherapy to 45 patients, and anlotinib-targeted therapy to 30 patients. R <sub>0</sub> resection was achieved in 73 cases. Patients were divided into groups based on the presence or absence of NF1, and baseline data between the two groups were compared. Kaplan-Meier curves were generated to assess disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) based on various factors (age, gender, presence of NF1, recurrent MPNST, stage Ⅳ MPNST, FNCLCC grade, R <sub>0</sub> resection, tumor location, tumor size, tumor depth, perioperative chemotherapy, postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy, and anlotinib-targeted therapy), and differences between survival curves were analyzed using the Log-Rank test. Multivariate COX proportional hazards regression was used to identify independent prognostic factors for MPNST. Patients with NF1 had a significantly higher proportion of superficial tumors and lower FNCLCC grade compared to those without NF1 ( <i>P</i><0.05); no significant difference was found for other variables ( <i>P</i><0.05). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that recurrent MPNST, stage Ⅳ MPNST, FNCLCC grade, R <sub>0</sub> resection, perioperative chemotherapy, and anlotinib-targeted therapy were factors influencing 1-year DFS ( <i>P</i><0.05), while stage Ⅳ MPNST, FNCLCC grade, and perioperative chemotherapy were factors affecting 3-year OS ( <i>P</i><0.05). Multivariate COX proportional hazards regression analysis revealed that recurrent MPNST and high-grade FNCLCC (G3) were independent prognostic factors for 1-year DFS ( <i>P</i><0.05), while stage Ⅳ MPNST, superficial tumor depth, age over 60 years, postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy, and anlotinib-targeted therapy were independent prognostic factors for 3-year OS ( <i>P</i><0.05). MPNST patients with NF1 tend to have more superficial tumors and lower FNCLCC grades. FNCLCC grade, R <sub>0</sub> resection, and adjuvant therapies, including radiotherapy and anlotinib-targeted therapy, are closely associated with MPNST prognosis. Complete surgical resection should be prioritized in clinical management, along with adjuvant treatments such as radiotherapy and targeted therapy of anlotinib to improve patient outcomes."

A clinical data of 41 patients with NF1 admitted between December 2018 and April 2024 was retrospectively analyzed. There were 15 males and 26 females, with an average age of 27.5 years (range, 5-61 years). Only one type of neurofibroma existed in 3 patients and the rest of the patients had more than two types of neurofibromas. Fourteen patients had total resection of multiple cutaneous neurofibromas (CNF). Eighteen patients of diffuse neurofibromas underwent total, near-total, or subtotal resection. Among the 13 patients of localized nodular neurofibromas, 9 of benign tumors underwent total sub-capsular resection and 4 of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) underwent maginal resection, and only 1 underwent postoperative radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Among the 15 patients of plexiform neurofibromas (PNF), 5 patients underwent both superficial and deep PNF resection, 2 underwent the superficial PNF resection, and 8 underwent the large nodular lesions in the deep PNF resection. There were 8 MPNST, of which 7 cases underwent total sub-capsular resection and large tumor capsule resection under neurophysiological monitoring, and 1 case with the tumor located on the top of the head underwent wide resection and skin grafting. One patient underwent proton knife therapy after surgery, 2 patients did not receive radiotherapy, and the remaining patients received conventional radiotherapy. All patients were followed up after surgery, and the follow-up time was 3-66 months, with an average of 25.0 months. Patients with CNF recovered satisfactorily after surgery, and there was no recurrence during follow-up. Patients with diffuse neurofibromas relieved preoperative symptoms after surgery. Three patients with diffuse neurofibromas located in the head and face recurred during follow-up. The patients with benign localized nodular neurofibromas recovered well after surgery, and only 1 patient had transient regional neuralgia after surgery. Among the patients with MPNST, 2 patients died of recurrence and lung metastasis, while the remaining 2 patients had no recurrence and metastasis during follow-up. All preoperative symptoms disappeared in patients with benign PNF, and no tumor recurrence was observed during follow-up. Two patients with PNF located in the brachial plexus had difficulty in shoulder abduction after surgery, 1 patient with PNF located in vagus developed hoarseness after surgery. Among the 8 patients with MPNST in PNF, 1 died of lung metastases and 1 died of systemic failure. The remaining 6 patients were in stable condition during follow-up, and no tumor recurrence or metastasis was observed. According to the clinical features of neurofibromas in patients with NF1, choosing appropriate surgical approaches can obtain good effectiveness. Because of the difficulty of completely resection, diffuse neurofibromas, especially those located in the head and face, are prone to recurrence after surgery. MPNST has the worst prognosis, high incidence of recurrence/metastasis, and short survival period. Total resection combined with radiotherapy can decrease local recurrence."

    "abstract": "To review the emergency management and perioperative strategies for ruptured neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)-related giant plexiform neurofibroma (PNF), providing a systematic treatment protocol to improve the therapeutic outcomes and quality of life for patients with giant PNF. The literature on the management of giant PNF rupture and hemorrhage was reviewed, and the diagnosis, treatment, and perioperative management were summarized based on clinical experiences. By implementing an integrated diagnostic and treatment strategy that includes early diagnosis, imaging evaluation, emergency ultra-selective arterial embolization combined with surgical excision, acute hemorrhage can be effectively controlled while also reducing the risk of major intraoperative bleeding and minimizing postoperative complications. As a result, this approach significantly improves treatment success rates and patient quality of life. For ruptured NF1-related giant PNF, employing emergency ultra-selective arterial embolization combined with surgical excision, under the collaboration of a multidisciplinary team, can effectively improve treatment success rates, rapidly control bleeding, reduce tumor size, and lower mortality. Future research should focus on assessing the long-term quality of life of patients treated for ruptured and hemorrhaging giant PNF and on further optimizing treatment protocols."

    "abstract": "To summarize the latest developments in neurosurgical treatments for neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and explore therapeutic strategies to provide comprehensive treatment guidelines for clinicians. The recent domestic and international literature and clinical cases in the field of NF1 were reviewed. The main types of neurological complications associated with NF1 and their treatments were thorough summarized and the future research directions in neurosurgery was analyzed. NF1 frequently results in complex and diverse lesions in the central and peripheral nervous systems, particularly low-grade gliomas in the brain and spinal canal and paraspinal neurofibromas. Treatment decisions should be made by a multidisciplinary team. Symptomatic plexiform neurofibromas and tumors with malignant imaging evidence require neurosurgical intervention. The goals of surgery include reducing tumor size, alleviating pain, and improving appearance. Postoperative functional rehabilitation exercises, long-term multidisciplinary follow-up, and psychosocial interventions are crucial for improving the quality of life for patients. Advanced imaging guidance systems and artificial intelligence technologies can help increase tumor resection rates and reduce recurrence. Neurosurgical intervention is the primary treatment for symptomatic plexiform neurofibromas and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors when medical treatment is ineffective and the lesions progress rapidly. Preoperative multidisciplinary assessment, intraoperative electrophysiological monitoring, and advanced surgical assistance devices significantly enhance surgical efficacy and safety. Future research should continue to explore new surgical techniques and improve postoperative management strategies to achieve more precise and personalized treatment for NF1 patients."

    "abstract": "Prognoses for pediatric brain tumors are suboptimal, as even in low-grade tumors, management techniques can lead to damage in the developing brain. Therefore, advanced neuroimaging methods are critical for developing optimal management plans and improving patient care. Magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) has allowed for the characterization of adult gliomas by their mechanical properties, which are uniquely sensitive to the complex interplay of cellularity, vasculature, and interstitium. However, pediatric tumors differ in behavior and cytoarchitecture, and their mechanical properties have never been assessed. Here, we conduct the first study of pediatric brain tumor mechanical properties by using MRE to measure tissue stiffness and damping ratio in low grade gliomas (LGGs). We additionally measure the mechanical properties of non-neoplastic focal abnormal signal intensities (FASIs) in children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). 23 patients age 4-17 years who had MR imaging results consistent with a primary LGG or with NF1 were included in this study. We found that pediatric gliomas are on an average 10.9% softer (p = 0.010) with a 17.3% lower (p = 0.009) viscosity than reference tissue. Softness of tumors appeared consistent across tumor subtypes and unrelated to tumor size or contrast-enhancement. In NF1 we found that, unlike gliomas, FASIs are stiffer, though not significantly, than reference tissue by an average of 10.4% and have a 16.7% lower damping ratio. Measuring tumor mechanical properties patterning and heterogeneity has potential to aid in prediction of biological behavior and inform management strategies for pediatric patients."

Out of these, 13 patients (56.5%) had incompletely resected tumors, 8 patients (34.7%) experienced recurrence after surgery, and 2 patients (8.7%) had unresectable tumors. Before CIRT treatment, 4 patients underwent a second surgery after the first local recurrence (LR), and 1 patient underwent a third surgery for the second local relapse of the disease. Six (26%) patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The most frequent tumor site was the brachial plexus (n = 9; 39.1%). In 5 patients (21.7%), neurofibromatosis type 1 disorder was found, while 4 patients (17, 4%) had radiation-induced MPNSTs. The median CIRT prescribed total dose was 69.8 Gy (relative biological effectiveness; range, 54-76.8) delivered in a median of 16 fractions (range, 15-22). Eleven patients (47.82%) were treated according to a sequential boost protocol with a median prescribed dose to clinical target volume LR of 45 Gy (relative biological effectiveness; range, 41.4-54). After a median follow-up time of 23 months (range, 3-100 months), the overall survival rates at 1 and 2 years were 82.38% and 61.51%, respectively. The 1-year and 2-year local relapse-free survival rates were 65.07% and 48.80%, respectively, and the 1-year and 2-year progression-free survival rates were 56.37% and 40.99%, respectively. No patients showed acute or late grade 4 toxicity or any treatment-related deaths. Ten patients (43.48%) reported acute toxicities of grade ≥ 2, which included dermatitis in 6 patients, mucositis in 2 patients, and peripheral neuropathy in 4 patients. Eight patients (34.78%) reported late toxicities of grade ≥ 2, mainly due to loco-regional neuropathy. High-dose CIRT shows favorable local effects with acceptable toxicities in patients with gross residual and LR after surgery or unresectable malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors.

The aim of the present study was to exhaustively assess social cognition abilities (emotion, theory of mind, moral reasoning, and social information processing) in adults with NF1, compared with a control group, and to explore links between social cognition and disease characteristics (mode of inheritance, severity, and visibility). We administered a social cognition battery to 20 adults with NF1 (mean age = 26.5 years, <i>SD</i> = 7.4) and 20 healthy adults matched for sociodemographic variables. Patients scored significantly lower than controls on emotion, theory of mind, moral reasoning, and social information processing tasks. No effects of disease characteristics were found. These results appear to confirm that adults with NF1 have a social cognition weaknesses that could explain, at least in part, their social difficulties, although social abilities are not all impaired to the same extent. Regarding the impact of the disease characteristics, the patient sample seemed slightly insufficient for the power analyses performed. Thus, this exploratory study should form the basis of further research, with the objective of replicating these results with larger and more appropriately matched samples."

These difficulties, including depression and anxiety, are typically measured through parental report of child functioning in research and rarely have children with NF1 rated their own well-being. Discrepancies between parent proxy- and child self-report of psychosocial functioning in other populations have been shown to relate to socioemotional problems and distress. This study examined the concordance of parent proxy- and child self-report of child behavioral and social-emotional functioning on selected Behavior Assessment System for Children-Second Edition subscales in families of children with NF1 and plexiform neurofibroma tumors (pNFs). We also sought to explore possible child, family, and community factors relating to discrepancies in reporting for youth with NF1 and pNFs. Overall, parents reported higher symptoms across psychosocial domains (anxiety, depression, and atypicality) in comparison to their children. Furthermore, characteristics like child sex, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder diagnosis, and family functioning significantly predicted differences in ratings of child functioning. These findings indicate that multi-informant studies are crucial to understanding multiple perspectives among family members in symptom-reporting and risk factors for these discrepancies.

In this proof-of-concept study, we performed somatic whole-exome sequencing (WES) to profile the genomic alterations in four samples from a patient with NF1-associated MPNST, consisting of a benign plexiform neurofibroma, a primary MPNST, and metastases from lung and skin tissues. By comparing genomic patterns, we identified a high level of variability across samples with distinctive genetic changes which allow for the definition of profiles of the early phase with respect to the late metastatic stages. Pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants were abundant in the primary tumor, whereas the metastatic samples exhibited a high level of copy-number variations (CNVs), highlighting a possible genomic instability in the late phases. The most known MPNST-related genes, such as <i>TP53</i> and <i>SUZ12</i>, were identified in CNVs observed within the primary tumor. Pathway analysis of altered early genes in MPNST pointed to a potential role in cell motility, division and metabolism. Moreover, we employed survival analysis with the <i>TCGA</i> sarcoma genomic dataset on 262 affected patients, in order to corroborate the predictive significance of the identified early and metastatic MPNST driver genes. Specifically, the expression changes related to the mutated genes, such as in <i>RBMX</i>, <i>PNPLA6</i> and <i>AGAP2</i>, were associated with reduced patient survival, distinguishing them as potential prognostic biomarkers. This study underlines the relevance of integrating genomic results with clinical information for early diagnosis and prognostic understanding of tumor aggressiveness."

    "abstract": "Children with Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) show cognitive, behavioural and social differences compared to their peers. However, the age and sequence at which these differences begin to emerge is not fully understood. This prospective cohort study examines the cognitive, behavioural, ADHD trait and autism symptom development in infant and pre-school children with NF1 compared with typically developing (TD) children without a family history of neurodevelopmental conditions. Data from standardised tests was gathered at 5, 10, 14, 24 and 36 months of age (NF1 n = 35, TD n = 29). Developmental trajectories of cognitive (Mullen Scales of Early Learning, MSEL) and adaptive behavioural (Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, VABS) development from 5 to 36 months were analysed using linear mixed modelling. Measures of ADHD (Child Behavior Checklist) and autism traits (ADOS-2, BOSA-MV and ADI-R) were assessed at 24 and 36 months. The developmental trajectory of cognitive skills (all domains of the MSEL) and behavioural skills (four domains of the VABS) differed significantly between NF1 and TD groups. Post-hoc tests demonstrated that the NF1 participants scored significantly lower than TD participants at 24 months on all MSEL and VABS domains. The NF1 cohort demonstrated higher mean autism and ADHD traits at 24 months and 14% of the NF1 cohort met a research diagnostic classification for autism at 36 months. The study has a relatively small sample size due to variable retention and rolling recruitment. Due to limitations imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, we utilised the Brief Observation of Symptoms of Autism for Minimally Verbal children (BOSA-MV) for some participants, which was administered online and may not gather as accurate a picture of traits as ADOS-2. The BOSA-MV was utilised for 41% of participants with NF1 at 36 months compared to 11% at 24 months. This may explain the reduction in the percentage of children with NF1 that met autism criteria at 36 months. By 24 months of age, the NF1 cohort show lower cognitive skills and adaptive behaviour and higher levels of autism and ADHD traits as compared to TD children. This has implications for developmental monitoring and referral for early interventions. Not applicable."

However, no case of multiple gastric gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) or duodenal ampulla neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) with multiple liver metastases in a patient with NF-1 has yet been reported. Here, we describe a case of a 55-year-old female patient with NF-1 whose serum Pro-Gastrin-Releasing Peptide (pro-GRP) levels were elevated. Gastrointestinal endoscopy and biopsy showed duodenal papilla space-occupying mass, and the pathological diagnosis turned out to be neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). During surgical exploration, multiple tumors were found on the serosal surface of the stomach and numerous miliary metastases in the liver. Following histopathological examination, it was determined that the liver metastases were NF-1 and the tumors in the gastric wall were GISTs. The patient benefited from targeted therapy and had an uneventful hospital stay. In this case, we emphasize treating patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 who exhibit abdominal symptoms with a high degree of clinical suspicion and performing thorough evaluations to rule out multiple tumors."

This study aimed to objectively evaluate the size, number, and symmetry of fungiform papillae in NF1 individuals and investigate the relationship between these alterations and taste perception, salivary flow, dietary habits, and BMI. A cross-sectional case-control study was conducted on 80 participants (40 with NF1 and 40 controls), matched by age and sex. Participants underwent quantitative and morphological evaluation of fungiform papillae, gustatory perception tests, sialometry, saliva analysis, xerostomia assessment, dietary assessments, and Body Mass Index calculations. The NF1 group exhibited significantly larger and more asymmetric fungiform papillae and exhibited a higher detection threshold for sweet and sour tastes, as well as hyposalivation and lower preference for healthy foods compared to the controls. No correlation was found between papillae morphology, gustatory perception tests, saliva properties, xerostomia, food preferences, or BMI in the NF1 group. Enlarged and asymmetric fungiform papillae, hyposalivation, heightened sensitivity to sweet and sour tastes, and reduced healthy eating habits were common in NF1. Although fungiform papillae alterations seem unrelated to taste sensitivity and food preferences, further investigation is needed to better understand the mechanisms underlying these changes."

Due to the impossibility of dissection, a right hemithyroidectomy was performed and the pathological examination confirmed the presence of plexiform neurofibroma and intrathyroidal neurofibroma. This is the second case reported in childhood and the youngest case to date. Neurofibroma with thyroid involvement should be suspected in patients with cervical mass and NF1, since diagnostic guidance allows avoiding unnecessary studies and guide treatment."

Low-grade glioma is considered a chronic disease, since residual tumor is present in many children. The tumor and its treatment lead to acquired brain injury with diverse consequences for later life based on factors like the diverse tumor locations, treatment(s) applied, neurofibromatosis type 1, and age at diagnosis. An overview of affected domains is provided based upon cohort studies from literature and partially based on clinical experience with a practical approach regarding each domain of functioning in order to provide insight in the requirements for long-term care assistance after childhood low-grade glioma. The diverse domains that can potentially be affected are described as follows: motor function, speech, eating and swallowing, sensory functions, seizures, neuropathy, organ function after systemic treatment, late effects due to cranial radiation (vascular changes and secondary tumors, endocrine and hypothalamic function, sleep and energy, neuro-cognition and education, psychosocial effects, and quality of life. Insight in affected domains guides advices for medical follow-up, diagnostics, supportive instructions, and assistive measures per domain of functioning and provide insight in the requirements for long-term care assistance after childhood low-grade glioma."

Fragile X syndrome (FXS), Angelman syndrome (AS), Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC), and Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) are monogenic disorders with high a prevalence of ASD symptomatology. This study aimed to identify ASD symptom profiles in a large group of children and adolescents (0;9-28 years) with FXS, AS, TSC, and NF1. Data on ASD symptomatology (Autism Diagnostic Observation Scale (ADOS-2) & Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS-2)) were collected from children and adolescents with FXS (n = 54), AS (n = 93), TSC (n = 112), and NF1 (n = 278). To identify groups of individuals with similar ASD profiles, we performed two latent profile analyses. We identified a four-profile model based on the ADOS-2, with a (1) 'Non-spectrum symptom profile', (2) 'Social Affect symptom profile', (3)'Restricted/Repetitive Behaviors symptom profile', and (4)'ASD symptom profile'. We also identified a four-profile model based on the SRS, with a (1)'Non-clinical symptom profile', (2)'Mild symptom profile', (3)'Moderate symptom profile', and (4)'Severe symptom profile'. Although each syndrome group exhibited varying degrees of severity, they also displayed heterogeneity in the profiles in which they were classified. We found distinct ASD symptom profiles in a population consisting of children and adolescents with FXS, AS, TSC, and NF1. Our study highlights the importance of a personalized approach to the identification and management of ASD symptoms in rare genetic syndromes. Future studies should aim to include more domains of functioning and investigate the stability of latent profiles over time."

    "title": "Genetic principles related to neurocutaneous disorders.",
    "abstract": "A detailed understanding of genetics is critical to the diagnosis, management, and prognostication of neurocutaneous disorders. Inheritance patterns can provide a key to the identification of different neurocutaneous disorders. Autosomal dominant disorders, like neurofibromatosis type 1 and tuberous sclerosis complex, affect males and females equally and are typically seen in every generation of a pedigree due to pathogenic changes to one copy of a gene on a somatic chromosome. Autosomal recessive disorders, such as ataxia-telangiectasia, affect males and females equally but typically skip generations on pedigrees as there needs to be a pathogenic variant of the gene on each of the pair of somatic chromosomes. X-linked disorders such as incontinentia pigmenti and Fabry disease primarily affect males or affect them more severely, but in the case of incontinentia pigmenti, the condition is lethal in males and only females are noted to be affected. The pathogenic variant that is disease causing is on the X sex chromosome, of which females have two and males have one. Somatic mosaic disorders like Sturge Weber syndrome are due to pathogenic variants only in a subset of cells post-fertilization and are not present in gametes, and so are not passed on to the next generation. Conditions that are a result of germline mosaicism are usually identified as autosomal dominant conditions that have not been present in the family prior to a single child being affected, with suspicion strengthening if siblings are diagnosed with the same condition. Regardless of the suspected inheritance pattern, it is essential to consider the ethical implications of genetic testing, including family planning, discovery of consanguinity, disclosure to other potentially affected family members, and diagnostic uncertainty."

    "abstract": "This paper describes a rare case of malignant triton tumor (MTT), a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor with rhabdomyoblastic differentiation, that occurred in a 21-year-old male with no concomitant clinical signs of neurofibromatosis. Although total surgical excision is ideal, the high recurrence rate and distant metastases frequently result in a poor prognosis. A biopsy, in this case, revealed spindle cells organized in short fascicles, with minor anisonucleosis and cross-striations indicating rhabdomyomatous differentiation. Positive immunohistochemistry for epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), Desmin, and S100 markers validated the diagnosis. For further treatment, the patient was referred to a cancer center. Even without clinical signs of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1), the research emphasizes the need to evaluate MTTs as a differential diagnosis for individuals presenting with tumors in the head and neck area. Histopathology and immunohistochemistry are useful diagnostic techniques, and early intervention with surgical excision may enhance the outcome. The paper concludes with a review of the histological criteria needed to establish the diagnosis of MTT and the distinctions between sporadic and NF-1-associated tumors."

Recognized RASopathy conditions include neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), Noonan syndrome, capillary malformation-arteriovenous malformation syndrome, Costello syndrome, cardiofacio-cutaneous (CFC) syndrome, LEOPARD syndrome and Legius syndrome. The RASopathies often display overlapping clinical features, presumably owing to common RAS-MAPK signaling pathway activation driving dysregulated cell proliferation. Epidermal nevus syndromes (ENS) are described as the presence of epidermal nevi, in individuals also affected by extra-cutaneous organ system involvement, and there is recent recognition of mosaic RAS mutations as molecular drivers of ENS. Currently, no curative treatments exist for RASopathy driven conditions, but rather symptom-directed management is the currently accepted standard. Here, we detail a unique case of a child exhibiting diffuse spinal nerve root hypertrophy in the context of epidermal nevus syndrome driven by molecularly confirmed <i>KRAS G12D</i> mosaicism, treated with the MEK 1/2 inhibitor selumetinib. Herein, we report the response of this patient to targeted therapy of more than two years' duration, including stabilization of multilevel nerve root hypertrophy as well as significant improvement in epidermal nevi. While the effectiveness of MEK inhibitors such as selumetinib is established in <i>NF1</i>-associated inoperable plexiform neurofibromas, their use in managing hyperactive <i>KRAS</i>-driven epidermal nevi and hypertrophic neuropathy remains unproven, and this case, to our knowledge, is the first such case to be reported. Shared molecular dysregulation and overlapping clinical features between these conditions suggest potential for effective therapeutic application of MEK directed therapy to address a range of conditions resulting from germline and/ or mosaic expression of aberrantly regulated RAS signaling."

    "abstract": "Areas of increased signal intensity, known as T2 hyperintensities (T2Hs), observed on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, are linked to a spectrum of brain abnormalities in children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Defining the radiological characteristics that distinguish non-neoplastic from neoplastic T2Hs in children with NF1 is crucial. Then, we could identify lesions that were most likely to require oncologic surveillance. We conducted a single-center retrospective review of all available brain MRIs from 98 children with NF1 and 50 healthy pediatric controls. All T2Hs identified on MRI were characterized based on location, imaging features, and the presence of lesion-related symptoms. Subsequently, all T2Hs were classified using newly established criteria and categorized into 3 distinct groups: low-risk tumor lesions, medium-risk tumor lesions, and high-risk tumor lesions. Lesions deemed to be high-risk will be recommended for surgical treatment. T2Hs were present in 61 (62.2%) individuals of the NF1 cohort. T2Hs were a highly sensitive (100%; 95% confidence interval 92.9%-100.0%) and specific (62.2%; 95% confidence interval 51.9%-71.8%) marker for the diagnosis of NF1. In children aged 4-10, the detection rate of T2Hs is significantly higher than in children under 4 years old and those aged between 10 and 18 (P < 0.05). T2Hs were most frequently located in basal ganglia, cerebellar hemispheres, and brainstem. During the follow-up process, none of the lesions categorized as low-risk or medium-risk tumor lesions progressed to high-risk tumor lesions. Seven patients had high-risk tumor lesions and underwent surgical treatment. The pathological assessment identified 5 cases of glioma among the 7 patients, along with 1 case of gliosis and 1 case of vascular dysplasia. Low-risk and medium-risk tumor lesions can both be classified as unidentified bright objects . Unidentified bright objects constituted the majority of T2Hs in children with NF1. High-risk tumor lesions should be considered as probable tumors. With the application of standardized radiologic criteria, a high prevalence of probable brain tumors will be identified in this at-risk population of children, which underscores the importance of vigilant and appropriate oncological surveillance to ensure timely detection and intervention for these tumors."

Given the critical role of cysteine residues in protein stability and function, we aimed to identify key NF1 mutations affecting cysteine residues that significantly contribute to neurofibromatosis pathology. To identify the most critical mutations in the NF1 gene that contribute to the pathology of neurofibromatosis, we employed a sophisticated computational pipeline specifically designed to detect significant mutations affecting the NF1 gene. Our approach involved an exhaustive search of databases such as the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD), UniProt, and ClinVar for information on missense mutations associated with NF1. Our search yielded a total of 204 unique cysteine missense mutations. We then employed in silico prediction tools, including PredictSNP, iStable, and Align GVGD, to assess the impact of these mutations. Among the mutations, C379R, R1000C, and C1016Y stood out due to their deleterious effects on the biophysical properties of the neurofibromin protein, significantly destabilizing its structure. These mutations were subjected to further phenotyping analysis using SNPeffect 4.0, which predicted disturbances in the protein's chaperone binding sites and overall structural stability. Furthermore, to directly visualize the impact of these mutations on protein structure, we utilized AlphaFold3 to simulate both the wild-type and mutant NF1 structures, revealing the significant effects of the R1000C mutation on the protein's conformation. In conclusion, the identification of these mutations can play a pivotal role in advancing the field of precision medicine and aid in the development of effective drugs for associated diseases."

An 82-year-old female patient with no neurological deficits or trauma presented to our hospital with right hemianopsia. Head magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed left occipital cerebral infarction and magnetic resonance angiography demonstrated high signal intensity in the left transverse sinus (TS). The attending doctor diagnosed an old infarction on the left occipital lobe and dural arteriovenous fistula (AVF) in the TS. After 3 years after the first diagnosis, her new attending doctor re-checked the MRI and performed digital subtraction angiography (DSA). The DSA examination revealed a single-hole AVF between the vertebral artery and external vertebral plexus at the C2 level, which was diagnosed as upper cervical VA-EVVP. The patient presented with tinnitus due to a high-flow VA-EVVP fistula, so we performed coil embolization of the fistula under general anesthesia using a double-catheter technique and achieved subtotal embolization, which diminished the intracranial reflux. The 6-month follow-up DSA image revealed complete obliteration of the AVF. We report a rare case of upper cervical VA-EVVP fistula in a patient with no history of trauma and relevant medical conditions. Coil embolization of the fistula was performed using a combination of balloon-assisted and double-catheter techniques. Although the patient showed residual shunt flow after the intervention, follow-up DSA revealed complete obliteration.

NF1 and NS are associated with differences in social communication and related neuropsychiatric risks. During the last decade, there has been growing interest in Ras-linked syndromes as models to understand social communication deficits and autism spectrum disorder. We systematically review the literature between 2010 and 2023 focusing on the social communication construct of the Research Domain Criteria framework. We provide an integrative summary of the research on facial and nonfacial social communication processes in NF1 and NS across molecular, cellular, neural circuitry, and behavioral domains. At the molecular and cellular levels, dysregulation in the Ras pathway is intricately tied to variations in social communication through changes in GABAergic (gamma-aminobutyric acidergic), glutamatergic, and serotonergic transmission, as well as inhibitory/excitatory imbalance. Neural circuitry typically associated with learning, attention, and memory in NF1 and NS (e.g., corticostriatal connectivity) is also implicated in social communication. We highlight less-researched potential mechanisms for social communication, such as white matter connectivity and the default mode network. Finally, key gaps in NF1 and NS literature are identified, and a roadmap for future research is provided. By leveraging genetic syndrome research, we can understand the mechanisms associated with behaviors and psychiatric disorders."

WES successfully revealed the genetic diagnoses of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1), Down syndrome, multisystemic smooth muscle dysfunction syndrome, Noonan syndrome, and alpha thalassemia. The previously reported modifier genes, RNF213 and MRVI1, were confirmed in the NF-1 and Down syndrome cases. Further analysis revealed rare hypomorphic variants in the causative genes of the primary disorders underlying MMS, such as Alagille syndrome and Rasopathies, conferred susceptibility to MMS. Genes involved in the development of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), such as ABCC8 and BMPR2, were also identified as potential modifiers. The rare variants in the MMS and PAH genes were significantly enriched in the eight Japanese patients with MMS compared with the 104 Japanese individuals from the 1000 Genomes Project. Disease genes associated with the arterial occlusive conditions represented by those of Rasopathies and PAH may provide novel diagnostic markers and future therapeutic targets for MMS as well as moyamoya disease with an unknown cause."

However, a long-segment extradural spinal malignant spindle cell neoplasm has not been reported in the current literature. We present the first reported case of spinal malignant spindle cell neoplasm extended along the spine. The detected lesion is responsible for compressing various segments of the spinal cord, causing thinning of the cord and secondary stenosis of the spinal canal, leading to a condition known as multisegment compression myelopathy. MPNSTs are typically detected late due to nonspecific symptoms, with a higher incidence in extremities and a notable occurrence in unusual locations. Diagnosis relies on MRI and histopathology, with S_100 positivity as a neural marker. MPNSTs can arise from neurofibromas or Schwann cells, with a significant portion resulting from TP53 mutations or secondary to radiation exposure. This case stands out due to its unique presentation, characterized by a predominantly spindle cell morphology with certain epithelioid features.

They represent a group of clinically related disorders often characterised by multiple Café au Lait Macules (CALMs). To determine, using in depth transcriptomic analysis of NF1 melanocytes from CALM and unaffected skin, (1) the gene(s) responsible for melanocyte proliferation and migration, and (2) the activated signalling pathway(s) in NF1 melanoma. Classical NF1 (<i>n</i> = 2, who develop tumours) and 3bp deletion NF1 (p. Met992del, who do not develop tumours) (<i>n</i> = 3) patients underwent skin biopsies from CALM and unaffected skin. Melanocytes were isolated and propagated, with five replicates from each tissue sample. DNA and RNA were extracted for mutational analysis and transcriptomic profiling with six replicates per sample. Mechanistic determination was undertaken using melanocyte and melanoma cell lines. All CALMs in NF1 were associated with biallelic <i>NF1</i> loss, resulting in amplification of Ras/MAPK and Wnt pathway signalling. CALMs were also associated with reduced <i>SERPINF1</i> gene expression (and pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) levels, the reciprocal protein), a known downstream target of the master regulator of melanocyte differentiation microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), leading to increased melanocyte proliferation, migration and invasion. In classical NF1 and melanoma, but not 3bp deletion NF1, there was also activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway. Pigment epithelium-derived factor was found to reduce cell proliferation and invasion of NF1 melanoma. Melanocyte proliferation and migration leading to CALMs in NF1 arises from biallelic <i>NF1</i> loss, resulting in RAS/MAPK pathway activation, and reduced expression of the tumour suppressor PEDF. Activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway in classical NF1 and NF1 melanoma may facilitate tumour growth."

    "abstract": "Dural ectasia is a common manifestation of neurofibromatosis type 1. Although there have been reports of unsuccessful spinal anesthesia due to dual ectasia in Marfan syndrome, reports describing similar unsuccessful spinal anesthesia in neurofibromatosis type 1 are lacking. A parturient with neurofibromatosis type 1 was scheduled for a repeat cesarean section. During a previous cesarean section, she had experienced a failed spinal anesthesia, which resulted in a conversion to general anesthesia. Preoperative lumbar magnetic resonance imaging revealed dural ectasia, which was speculated to be the cause of the previous spinal anesthesia failure. Therefore, combined spinal-epidural anesthesia was implemented. Because the block level of spinal anesthesia was insufficient as predicted, supplemental administration of epidural anesthesia successfully provided adequate analgesia for the surgery. Combined spinal-epidural anesthesia can be useful for the management of cesarean sections in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1-associated dural ectasia."

    "abstract": "Patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) are exposed to a higher risk of developing neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). Periampullary neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs) in NF1 patients primarily affect the duodenum and periampullary region. A 50-year-old male patient was admitted to our hospital due to progressive skin and scleral yellowing for over 6 months. An abdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan revealed a tumor in the periampullary region, which measured 1.2 cm × 1.4 cm in size and showed a progressive enhancement. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography indicated the dilation of intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts. The patient was diagnosed with an ampullary tumor with the possibility of malignancy. A Whipple procedure was performed. Microscopically, the duodenum tumor was found to invade the mucosa, sphincter, and muscular layer of the duodenal papilla. Histologic hematoxylin and eosin staining confirmed the presence of duodenal G1 NET. Subsequently, a bibliometric analysis was performed to evaluate the state of NEN research. Publications about periampullary NENs showed an annual increase, with most of them focusing on the treatment and diagnosis of NENs. This article reported a case of periampullary duodenal NET in a patient with NF1, and a bibliometric analysis was conducted."

    "abstract": "Reconstruction of significant soft tissue defects in the head and neck region after resection of extensive plexiform neurofibromas, as well as preservation and restoration of cosmetic and functional aspects, presents a considerable challenge. The purpose is to evaluate the feasibility of eTMF in repairing substantial defects after the complete resection of NF1 PN. Patients diagnosed with substantial neurofibromatosis (NP) type 1 (NF1), according to the revised criteria, underwent complete resection and remodeling of the facial aesthetic unit. An extended vertical lower trapezius island myocutaneous flap (eTIMF) was used for the defect reconstruction. Perioperative complications were evaluated using the Clavien-Dindo classification. ECOG PS was assessed. Postoperative follow-up at 6 months and completion of UW-QOL. The questionnaire included swallowing, chewing, speech, and quality of life scores. Two patients had pathogenic missense variants: c.5609G>A (p.Arg1870Gln) in exon 38 of NF1 in the first case, and c.4600C>T (p.Arg1534*) in exon 35 in the second case. Two eTMFs were harvested successfully. Five facial esthetic units were remodeled, and 4 units were remodeled. Two extensive tumors were nearly entirely removed. No severe complications were noted. The ECOG PS improved from grade 3 in the first week postsurgery to grade 0 by the eighth week. The UW-QOL results indicated that swallowing, chewing, and speaking functions returned to their preoperative levels, with a 40% improvement in quality of life, reaching 60% and 80%, respectively. eTMF to repair substantial defects following total resection of NF1 PN and facial esthetic unit remodeling enhances appearance, function, and psychosocial outcomes. This technique is safe, efficient, resource-conserving, and simple to implement."

    "abstract": "Optic pathway gliomas (OPG) are rare tumors in children. Lesion extent, visual functions, neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1), and age are factors that guide treatment. This study evaluates the clinical characteristics, treatment, and outcome of children and adolescents with OPG treated over a 31-year period in a single center. Ninety-five patients with OPG diagnosed between January 1990 and December 2021 were retrospectively evaluated. First-line chemotherapy regimen consisted of vincristine and carboplatinum for 1 year. Radiotherapy was not used as first-line treatment and tried to be avoided in the ones who progressed after first-line treatment. Ninety-five children (44 male, 51 female) with a median age of 52 (1-216) months were evaluated. Sixty-three (66.3%) had NF1 and 10 (10,5%) diencephalic syndrome. The most common presenting symptoms were visual abnormalities and/or proptosis, nistagmus, and behavioral changes. Twenty-one (22.1%) patients with NF1 had stable disease throughout the follow-up period and received no treatment. Sixty-three of 74 patients received treatment at diagnosis and 11 due to progression during follow-up. Only one adolescent received radiotherapy at progression. Patients who progressed, received further line systemic treatment (vinblastine; bevacizumab; vincristine-cisplatinum-etoposide). Ten-year overall survival in all patients, in patients with NF1, and without NF1 were 97.2%, 98%, and 95.8% (p > .05), respectively; 10-year progression-free survival (PFS) in all patients, in patients with NF1, and without NF1 were 71.6%, 85.7%, and 54.2% (p = .001), respectively. In children with symptomatic/progressive OPG, chemotherapy consisting of vincristine-carboplatinum (VC) is effective. Radiotherapy may be avoided, especially in patients with NF1."

This was a double-blind, parallel-group, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial (the NF1-EXCEL trial: Examining the Cognitive and Electrophysiological benefit of Lamotrigine in Neurofibromatosis type 1; Clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT02256124), with the aim of enrolling 60 adolescents with NF1 aged 12 to 17 years 6 months. The short-term study intervention was 200 mg of lamotrigine taken orally for 26 weeks. The primary outcome was performance IQ tested with the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, Third Edition, complemented with secondary outcomes for visuospatial learning efficacy, visual perception, visual sustained attention, fine motor coordination, attention-deficit/hyperactivity problems, and executive functioning. We screened 402 adolescents with NF1, of whom 31 (eight females) entered the study. Complete-case analysis showed no effect of lamotrigine on either performance IQ (-0.23, 95% CI -6.90 to 6.44) or most secondary outcomes. Visual sustained attention showed a trend towards better performance in the lamotrigine group (-0.81, 95% CI -1.67 to 0.04). Lamotrigine did not improve cognitive functioning in adolescents with NF1. The small treatment effects make it unlikely that a larger sample size could have changed this conclusion."

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant disorder resulting from mutations in the <i>NF1</i> gene. Patients harboring these mutations are predisposed to a spectrum of peripheral nerve sheath tumors (PNSTs) originating from Schwann cells, of which malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are the deadliest, with limited treatment options. Therefore, an unmet need still exists for more effective therapies directed at these aggressive malignancies. Cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) is a reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) generating ionized gas that has been proposed to be a potential therapeutic modality for cancer. In this study, we sought to determine the effects of CAP on NF1-associated PNSTs. Utilizing established mouse and human cell lines to interrogate the effects of CAP in both in vitro and in vivo settings, we found that NF1-associated PNSTs were highly sensitive to CAP exposure, resulting in cell death. To our knowledge, this is the first application of CAP to NF1-associated PNSTs and provides a unique opportunity to study the complex biology of NF1-associated tumors."

The sample included 56 cone-beam computed tomography scans divided into two groups: a study group (SG; individuals with NF1; n = 28) and a control group (CG; individuals without NF1; n = 28). NSD, NBL, MNC, and INC classifications were assessed. MNC images were classified as normal, bullous, paradoxical, secondary, and accessory. INC images were classified as normal, lamellar, compact, combined, and bullous. Intra- and interobserver reliability were evaluated. SG had a mean NSD of 11.6° (±4.5°) compared with 9.6° (±3.2°) for the CG, showing moderate deviations with no significant difference between groups. SG had a mean NBL of 22.4 mm (±3.4 mm) compared with 22.1 mm (±3.2 mm) for the CG, with a statistically significant difference. Both groups exhibited normal, bullosa, and accessory MNC classifications. SG INC were normal, lamellar, and combined, whereas CG INC were normal and lamellar. There was a weak correlation between NSD and NBL across groups. Individuals with NF1 showed longer NBL. The weak correlation between NSD and NBL suggested multifactorial influences on these variations. These findings advance our understanding of craniofacial development in NF1 and highlight the need for further research into nasal cavity involvement in this complex genetic disorder."

    "abstract": "Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) are aggressive soft-tissue sarcomas and the leading cause of mortality in individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Despite many clinical trials, outcomes for patients with MPNST have remained stagnant, and most succumb to their disease; thus, novel therapeutic approaches are needed. A better understanding of the MPNST immune ecosystem will aid in the development of strategies to activate the immune system against the tumor. In this study, we profile the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) in NF1-associated peripheral nerve sheath tumors (PNST) to discover insights on the role played by tumor-infiltrating immune cells in malignant transformation. Using fresh and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue from patients diagnosed with NF1-PNST, we dissected the TIME through IHC, multiparameter flow cytometry, and comparative transcriptomic studies. Immunophenotyping confirmed increased immune cell infiltration during malignant progression, with a predominance of infiltrating myeloid cells, particularly CD163+ tumor-associated macrophages (TAM). The T cells within MPNST exhibited signs of tumor activation, characterized by high programmed cell death 1 expression. Additionally, MPNST specimens demonstrated elevated levels of immunosuppressive TAM, with heightened PD-L1 expression. The proportion of CD163+ myeloid cells within the TIME correlated with poorer progression-free survival. Notably, loss of H3K27 trimethylation correlated with low immune cell infiltration in MPNST. Malignant transformation of NF1-PNST is characterized by an immunosuppressive microenvironment comprising TAM with high expression of PD-L1, which is associated with inferior outcomes. These findings suggest the clinical potential of immune-modulating therapeutics that can unleash an antitumor immune response."

Here, we analyze register-based associations between NF1 and hospital visits related to oral infections. The Finnish NF1 cohort encompasses all individuals with verified NF1 who have visited the Finnish central and university hospitals in 1987-2011. The Finnish Care Register for Health Care allowed the follow-up of 1349 individuals with NF1, their 1894 siblings without NF1, and 13,870 matched controls for diagnoses related to oral infections in 1998-2014. We observed clearly increased hazards for hospital visits associated with dental caries (ICD-10 K02; NF1 vs. controls, hazard ratio [HR] 4.42, 95% CI 3.23-6.04), diseases of pulp and periapical tissues (K04; HR 3.85, 95% CI 2.68-5.54), and gingivitis and periodontal diseases (K05; HR 3.63, 95% CI 2.37-5.56). In contrast, hospital visits related to diseases of salivary glands (K11), and stomatitis and related lesions (K12) did not show significantly increased hazard in NF1 compared with the controls or the non-NF1 siblings. In conclusion, the findings suggest that hospital visits related to oral infections are relatively common among individuals with NF1. The results highlight the need for early detection, proactive prevention, and timely treatment of oral infections in individuals with NF1."

This study aims to determine whether diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used to identify the site and severity of lesions in individuals with AN. This case-control study included 10 individuals with AN of different etiologies, 7 individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), 5 individuals with cochlear hearing loss, and 37 control participants. Participants were recruited through the University of Melbourne's Neuroaudiology Clinic and the Murdoch Children's Research Institute specialist outpatient clinics. Diffusion-weighted MRI data were collected for all participants and the auditory pathways were evaluated using the fixel-based analysis metric of apparent fiber density. Data on each participant's auditory function were also collected including hearing thresholds, otoacoustic emissions, auditory evoked potentials, and speech-in-noise perceptual ability. Analysis of diffusion-weighted MRI showed abnormal white matter fiber density in distinct locations within the auditory system depending on etiology. Compared with controls, individuals with AN due to perinatal oxygen deprivation showed no white matter abnormalities ( p > 0.05), those with a neurodegenerative conditions known/predicted to cause VIII cranial nerve axonopathy showed significantly lower white matter fiber density in the vestibulocochlear nerve ( p < 0.001), while participants with NF1 showed lower white matter fiber density in the auditory brainstem tracts ( p = 0.003). In addition, auditory behavioral measures of speech perception in noise and gap detection were correlated with fiber density results of the VIII nerve. Diffusion-weighted MRI reveals different patterns of anatomical abnormality within the auditory system depending on etiology. This technique has the potential to guide management recommendations for individuals with peripheral and central auditory pathway abnormality."

NF1 gene encodes neurofibromin (a GTPase-activating protein) and plays a regulatory role in many signalling pathway such as the Ras/MAPK pathway, which is important for regulating cell growth, proliferation and neural development. Therefore, NF1 gene mutations causes the excessive activation of signalling pathways and uncontrolled cell growth. NF1 exhibits complete genetic penetrance and clinical heterogeneity. Glomerular disease has rarely been reported in patients with NF1, especially in children. Currently, the relationship between NF1 and nephrotic syndrome is unclear. Here, we present a case of NF1 with nephrotic syndrome and further explore the association between NF1 and glomerular diseases. It also reminds clinicians that NF1 has complex and highly variable clinical manifestations and that a comprehensive workup is essential for patients."

The activity of neurofibromin, the product of Neurofibromatosis Type 1 gene (NF1), is crucial in regulating the RAS/MAPK pathway. The NF1 somatic mutations are significant in conditions such as melanoma, lung cancer, breast cancer, neuroblastoma, and central nervous system tumors. Therefore, this research aims to uncover the profile of NF1 mutations and co-mutations in patients with brain metastases from lung adenocarcinoma, shedding light on their role in the pathophysiology of metastatic lung cancer. In this study, a total of 131 (31 females, 90 males) patients diagnosed with metastatic lung adenocarcinoma who were examined in the Molecular Pathology Laboratory between 2019 and 2022 were retrospectively analyzed. The NF1 somatic mutations and co-mutations were evaluated using the NGS lung panel on the MiniSEQ NGS platform. The average age of the 131 patients (31 females, 90 males) retrospectively examined in the study was 62.05 years. The ages of the cases included in the study followed a normal distribution according to Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (P = 0.200). Lymph node metastasis was detected in 48 patients (36.6%), while distant organ metastasis was observed in 81 patients (61.83%). Metastases were more frequently seen in males. No statistically significant difference was found between metastases and gender (P > 0.05). Distant organ metastasis (n = 26, 19.8%) and NF1 mutations (n = 8/26, 30.77%) were most commonly observed in the brain. The most common NF1 pathogenic variants in brain metastases were c.2325 + 3A > G (p.M1205fs*12) (n = 6/26, 23.07%) and c.1400C > T (p.T4671) (n = 5/26, 19.23%). There was no statistically significant relationship observed between patients' age, gender, brain metastasis, and NF1 mutation types (respectively, P = 0.98, P = 0.63, and P = 0.87). The mutations that showed the most association with NF1 mutations in brain metastases were PTEN and TP53. Somatic NF1 mutations and co-mutations can play a critical driving force in metastatic lung adenocarcinoma and may contribute to treatment resistance. The mutational landscape of somatic NF1 mutations and co-mutations can provide new insights into the pathophysiology of metastatic lung cancer, especially those that have metastasized to the brain."

We gathered a panel of European healthcare practitioners with clinical experience prescribing selumetinib and/or managing pediatric patients with NF1-PN to provide recommendations on the prevention and management of AEs. A modified Delphi approach was used to develop the recommendations among the group of experts. Initial statements were developed from a literature review of current management recommendations and regulatory reports. The panel refined the statements and rated the extent to which they agreed with them in 2 sessions and a follow-up survey. The panel comprised 2 pediatric neuro-oncologists, 1 pediatric oncologist, 1 pediatrician, 1 neuropediatrician, 1 oncologist, 1 neurologist, 2 psychologists, and 1 dermatologist. The experts agreed on the relative frequency and impact of AEs potentially associated with selumetinib. Consensus-level agreement was reached for 36 statements regarding the prevention and management of AEs potentially associated with selumetinib. Experts recommended treatments for AEs based on their experience. The development of a variety of consensus statements indicates expert agreement on best practices for the prevention and management of AEs potentially associated with selumetinib in pediatric patients with NF1-PN. These events are generally manageable and should be considered alongside treatment benefit. Information sharing is warranted as further experience is gained."

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), an autosomal dominant genetic disorder, is caused by mutations in the <i>NF1</i> gene, which encodes the GTPase-activating protein neurofibromin. The pathogenesis of the tumor progression of benign plexiform neurofibromas (PNs) and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) remain unclear. Here, we found that interferon-induced transmembrane protein 1 (IFITM1) was downregulated in MPNST tissues compared to those in PN tissues from patients with NF1. Overexpression of IFITM1 in NF1-associated MPNST cells resulted in a significant decrease in Ras activation (GTP-Ras) and downstream extracellular regulatory kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) phosphorylation, whereas downregulation of IFITM1 via treatment with small interfering RNA in normal Schwann cells had the opposite result, indicating that expression levels of IFITM1 are closely associated with tumor progression in NF1. Treatment of MPNST cells with interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) significantly augmented the expression of IFITM1, thereby leading to a decrease in Ras and ERK1/2 activation. Despite the small number of patient samples, these findings may potentially provide a new target for chemotherapy in patients with NF1-associated MPNSTs. In xenograft mice injected with MPNST cells, <i>IFN-</i>γ treatment successfully suppressed tumor progression with increased IFITM1 expression and decreased Ras and ERK1/2 activation in tumor tissues. Collectively, these results suggest that IFITM1 is closely involved in MPNST pathogenesis and that IFN-γ is a good candidate for the therapeutic treatment of MPNSTs in NF1."

To date, only 2 studies have indicated a high occurrence of TCS in the pediatric NF1 patient population. Our study aims to ascertain the incidence of TCS among Chinese pediatric patients with NF1. A single-institution, 8-year retrospective analysis at a tertiary-level children's hospital was conducted for patients with NF1 who underwent surgery for TCS. The clinical features, imaging characteristics, genetic testing outcomes, and histopathological findings of pediatric NF1 patients with TCS were analyzed. During the study period, a total of 115 pediatric patients were diagnosed with NF1. Among these 115 NF1 patients, 11 individuals, accounting for 9.6% of the sample, were confirmed to have TCS. This rate of occurrence is significantly higher than the incidence rate of TCS in the general population, which stands at 0.17%. All 11 of the pediatric NF1 patients underwent surgery for TCS. Out of the 11 patients who were advised to have tethered cord release surgery, 4 (36.4%) were girls, and the average age of these 11 patients was 8.6 years, with ages ranging from 2 to 17 years. The conus medullaris position of the 11 pediatric NF1 patients ranged from L1 to L2, and 10 of them (91%) had a filum terminale lipoma, characterized by high signal intensity on T1-weighted magnetic resonance images. Another patient was diagnosed with occult TCS. All 11 pediatric NF1 patients exhibited symptoms associated with TCS, such as neuromotor dysfunction, abnormalities in urination, defecation, skeletal system abnormalities, or pain. Eight of the 11 pediatric NF1 patients had undergone genetic testing, which is a crucial part of the diagnostic process for NF1. The histopathological examination of the 11 pediatric NF1 patients who underwent surgery revealed that 10 patients had fatty infiltration of the filum terminale, while the remaining patient exhibited fibrosis of the filum terminale. In the group of pediatric patients with NF1, the incidence of TCS, presenting to the pediatric neurosurgery clinic for any reason, is significantly higher than that of the general population. However, the pathophysiological relationship between NF1 and TCS is still not clear. It is essential to provide counseling to NF1 patients and their families about the symptoms of TCS to make sure they are aware and can seek the necessary care when needed. This underscores the importance of not only diagnosing NF1 but also staying alert for related conditions like TCS, which may have a higher occurrence in this demographic."

Management of both benign and malignant tumors arising in individuals with NF1 is demanding and tumors may be difficult to treat. Both standardized and individual surveillance programs are therefore highly important to prevent morbidity and mortality in patients with NF1. The guidelines for the clinical management of NF1 recently proposed by the European Reference Network for Genetic Tumor Risk Syndromes provide the cornerstone of the present surveillance form and were discussed through three rounds of voting and a final consensus meeting involving experts from five Austrian and one German clinical NF1 centers for adults and one patient organization representative. Subsequently, 31 items within 4 categories were integrated into the proposed surveillance form for Austria. All recommendations, unless otherwise specified, pertain to primarily asymptomatic patients in routine follow-up. At healthcare transition from pediatric to adult surveillance or the initial visit in adulthood, we suggest a thorough clinical, laboratory and radiological examination to obtain a baseline for future diagnostics. To comply with the general screening recommendations in Austria, we suggest extending the frequency of clinical visits from annual to biennial at 50 years of age. In cases of clinical dynamics, early follow-up is recommended to facilitate early detection of potential complications. Particular emphasis should be placed on preventive patient education."

We identified four loss-of-function heterozygous <i>LZTR1</i> variants in five children with multiple café au lait macules and one adult with multiple café au lait macules and axillar freckling, by applying gene panel analysis in four families. The three <i>LZTR1</i> variants, namely, c.184del/p.Glu62Ser<i>fs</i>*39, c.1927C < T/p.Gln643*, and c.857_858delinsT/p.Gly286Val<i>fs</i>*65, were novel, whereas the variant c.1018C > T/ p.Arg340* had been previously reported in a patient with schwannomatosis. Similar to what is known from other <i>LZTR1</i>-associated conditions, penetrance of the skin manifestations was reduced in two carriers of the familial variants. Our study expands the LZTR1 phenotype to the presence of isolated café au lait macules with or without freckling. Thus, variants in the <i>LZTR1</i> gene should be considered in patients with multiple café au lait macules."

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a complex multisystem genetic disorder that requires long-term, age-specific monitoring and multidisciplinary care. NF1 symptom burden can significantly affect the quality of life and impose a substantial economic burden on patients and their families. The approval and widespread availability of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK) inhibitors such as selumetinib for NF1-related plexiform neurofibromas have revolutionized the standard of care for patients with NF1, however their effective utilization hinges on early recognition of NF1. We present a consensus manuscript describing the challenges observed in the Arabian Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) for diagnosing and managing NF1. Experts from the GCC also present recommendations for the early recognition and management of NF1 and its complications. A referral pathway that can play a crucial role in helping primary healthcare providers refer their patients to experts is also proposed. Increasing the availability and accessibility of genetic testing at an affordable cost and optimizing personalized NF1 care are essential for NF1 management. Developing regional guidelines for NF1 management and establishing NF1 centers of excellence may facilitate better care and outcomes for patients with NF1 in the GCC region."

    "title": "Genetic basis and imaging findings of neurofibromatosis 1 and other somatic overgrowth disorders.",
    "abstract": "Somatic overgrowth disorders comprise a wide range of rare conditions that present with focal enlargement of one or more tissue types. The PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway is a signalling pathway that induces angiogenesis and cell proliferation, and is one of the most commonly overactivated signalling pathways in cancer. The PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway can be up-regulated by genetic variants that code for proteins in this pathway, or down-regulated by proteins that inhibit the pathway. Mosaic genetic variations can result in cells that proliferate excessively in specific anatomical locations. The PIK3CA-related overgrowth spectrum (PROS) disorders include CLOVES syndrome, macrodystrophia lipomatosa, and Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome among many. The neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) gene encodes neurofibromin which down-regulates the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway. Thousands of pathological variants in the NF1 gene have been described which can result in lower-than-normal levels of neurofibromin and therefore up-regulation of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway promoting cellular overgrowth. Somatic overgrowth is a rare presentation in NF1 with a wide range of clinical and radiological presentations. Hypertrophy of all ectodermal and mesodermal elements has been described in NF1 including bone, muscle, fat, nerve, lymphatics, arteries and veins, and skin. The shared signalling pathway for cellular overgrowth means that these radiological appearances can overlap with other conditions in the PIK3CA-related overgrowth spectrum. The aim of this review is to describe the genetic basis for the radiological features of NF1 and in particular compare the appearances of the somatic overgrowth disorders in NF1 with other conditions in the PIK3CA-related overgrowth spectrum."

This report presents the clinical course of two brothers diagnosed with CMMRD. The first patient was diagnosed with T-cell lymphoma at the age of three and a half years, a relapse, and synchronous glioblastoma at the age of seven and a half years. After treatment with chemotherapy and neurosurgery, haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) was performed. The second patient was diagnosed with mediastinal T-cell lymphoma at the age of two and a half years and a relapse at the age of four and a half years. He also received chemotherapy and underwent HSCT. Both patients exhibited café au lait macules (CALMs), a common but non-specific feature of CMMRD, often confused with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) syndrome. This study highlights the phenotype of CMMRD syndrome, associated cancers, and the potential benefits of stem cell transplantation. Previous reports suggest that allogeneic HSCT might reduce subsequent haematological malignancies and increase survival."

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1) is often characterized by vascular disorders related to vessel vulnerability that can lead to unfavorable outcomes. Here, we describe a case of NF-1 complicated with a massive subcutaneous hematoma posing a risk of visual impairment for which rapid decompression and a subsequent less invasive approach result in a favorable outcome. A 40-year-old woman with NF-1 presented with a massive left subcutaneous temporal hematoma following a mild head contusion. Four days after hospitalization, the hematoma increased in size and severely compressed the left eye, prompting immediate hematoma removal to preserve visual function. Immediately after the hematoma removal, a superficial temporal arteriovenous fistula was found on the digital subtraction angiography and embolized by the endovascular procedure. Her visual acuity was preserved, and no bleeding recurrence was observed throughout the follow-up. Surgical hematoma removal followed by endovascular treatment was effective in preserving visual function. Since vessel fragility is characteristic of patients with NF-1, it should be kept in mind that vascular complications may lead to serious clinical outcomes. In certain NF-1 cases, less invasive treatments for vascular abnormalities may be preferable."

The majority of PND requests came from parents with sporadic NF1. We describe two PNDs in women with mosaic NF1. In both families, direct PND showed the absence of the maternal NF1 variant in the fetus. However, microsatellite markers analysis showed that the risk haplotype had been transmitted. These rare cases of germline mosaicism illustrate the pitfall of indirect PND. Our study illustrates the crucial consequences of PND for medical and genetic counseling decisions. We also point to the challenges of germline mosaics."

    "abstract": "This study addresses the effectiveness of oral everolimus in treating various malignancies associated with Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1). The purpose is to determine whether everolimus reduces lesion size in NF1 patients, considering the controversial findings from previous clinical trials. The scientific hypotheses and questions involve evaluating the impact of everolimus on NF1-associated lesions and understanding the variability in treatment outcomes. A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted following PRISMA and Cochrane Collaboration guidelines. The study included four-phase II, single-arm, nonrandomized trials investigating the effect of oral everolimus on NF1-associated lesion size. The search covered multiple databases, and data extraction involved evaluating studies for inclusion criteria and assessing quality using the Cochrane Collaboration's Risk of Bias in Nonrandomized Studies tool. Statistical analysis utilized Open Meta(Analyst). The search yielded 388 studies, with 10 selected for full-text review and four included in the final analysis. The quality of the studies ranged from low to moderate. The meta-analysis indicated no observed heterogeneity (I^2 = 0%), and the overall estimate suggested no significant reduction in NF1-associated lesion size with everolimus (P = 0.069). The findings reveal a varied and inconsistent picture of everolimus efficacy in NF1 treatment. The study highlights the need for personalized approaches, considering individual genetic and clinical differences. The limitations, including small sample sizes and nonrandomized trials, call for larger, more standardized research efforts. The study emphasizes ongoing trials and the importance of future research in understanding predictors of everolimus response and optimizing treatment strategies for NF1 patients. While everolimus shows promise in reducing lesion size in a subset of NF1 patients, the study cannot draw conclusive results due to limitations in the included studies. Ongoing, adequately powered trials are crucial for advancing the evidence base and informing the potential role of everolimus in NF1 treatment. There was no funding for this review and no conflicts of interest."

The macular spectral-domain optical coherence tomography volumetric dataset obtained from 68 eyes (25 adult eyes, 43 pediatric eyes) with NF1 without optic glioma and 143 control eyes (100 adult eyes, 43 pediatric eyes) was used for image auto-segmentation. The intraretinal layers segmented from the volumetric data included the macular retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL), ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (GCIPL), inner nuclear layer, outer plexiform layer, outer nuclear layer, and photoreceptor layer. Cases and controls were compared after adjusting for age, sex, refractive error, and binocular use. The association between retinal layer thickness and visual acuity was also analyzed. The GCIPL was significantly thinner in both adult and pediatric patients with NF1 compared with healthy controls. Average RNFL and GCIPL thicknesses were associated with visual acuity in adult patients with NF1. In pediatric patients, average GCIPL thickness was associated with visual acuity. These results suggest that changes in the inner retinal layer could be a biomarker of the structural and functional status of patients with NF1."

There is sparse literature regarding the efficacy of ultrasound-guided perineural steroid injection in NF1 patients for treatment of benign peripheral nerve sheath tumor compressions. This case describes the utility of perineural steroid injections for symptomatic relief of NF1 neurofibroma-related pain. Perineural steroid injections should be considered when neurofibroma-related pain fails to respond to other conservative treatment. Steroid injections provide an alternative to oral medicinal management and avoid the often morbid risks of surgical intervention."

We aimed to describe the economic burden, health-related quality of life (HRQL), and caregiver burden of NF1 patients in China. We conducted an online cross-sectional survey employing the China Cloud Platform for Rare Diseases, with 223 caregivers of NF1 pediatric patients (patients under 18), and 226 adult patients. Economic burden was estimated using direct and indirect costs related to NF1 in 2021, and the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire: General Health V2.0 (WPAI-GH). HRQL measures included EQ-5D-Y proxy version and PedsQL<sup>™</sup> 4.0 Generic Core Scales (PedsQL GCS) proxy version for pediatric patients, and EQ-5D-5L and PedsQL<sup>™</sup> 3.0 Neurofibromatosis Module (PedsQL NFM) for adult patients. Caregiver burden was estimated by Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI). For pediatric patients, the average direct cost in 2021 was CNY 33,614 (USD 4,879), and employed caregivers' annual productivity loss was 81 days. EQ-5D-Y utility was 0.880 ± 0.13 and VAS score was 75.38 ± 20.67, with 52.6% patients reporting having problems in \"pain/discomfort\" and 42.9% in \"anxiety/depression.\" PedsQL GCS total score was 68.47 ± 19.42. ZBI score demonstrated that 39.5% of caregivers had moderate-to-severe or severe burden. For adult patients, average direct cost in 2021 was CNY 24,531 (USD 3,560). Patients in employment reported an absenteeism of 8.5% and presenteeism of 21.6% according to the results of WPAI-GH. EQ-5D-5L utility was 0.843 ± 0.17 and VAS score was 72.32 ± 23.49, with more than half of patients reporting having problems in \"pain/discomfort\" and \"anxiety/depression\" dimensions. PedsQL NFM total score was 68.40 ± 15.57. Both pediatric and adult NF1 patients in China had a wide-ranging economic burden and low HRQL, especially in the psychological dimension.

    "abstract": "Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) is a highly aggressive sarcoma that may be seen in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) or occur sporadically. While surgery is the primary treatment for localized MPNST with a 61.9% overall survival rate, metastatic disease is often fatal due to resistance to systemic therapies which underscores the urgent need for effective treatments. MPNSTs frequently harbor inactivating driver mutations in the PRC2 epigenetic repressor complex suggesting epigenetic therapies may represent a specific vulnerability in these tumors. Here, we investigate the role of the LSD1-HDAC1-CoREST (LHC) repressor complex in mediating MPNST tumor growth and progression. Our findings demonstrate that the LHC small molecule inhibitor, corin, induces apoptosis and significantly inhibits proliferation in MPNST cells. Transcriptomic analysis of corin-treated MPNST cells demonstrates specific increases in genes associated with axonogenesis and neuronal differentiation as well as altered extracellular matrix; additionally, corin treatment is shown to inhibit MPNST invasion in vitro. These results underscore the critical role of the LHC complex in facilitating MPNST growth and progression and suggest that targeting the LHC complex represents a promising therapeutic approach for this aggressive malignancy."

However, clinical trials investigating cNF treatments lack standardised outcome measures to objectively evaluate changes in cNF size and appearance. 3D imaging has been proposed as an objective standardised outcome measure however various systems exist with different features that affect useability in clinical settings. The aim of this study was to compare the accuracy, precision, feasibility, reliability and accessibility of three imaging systems. We compared the Vectra-H1, LifeViz-Micro and Cherry-Imaging systems. A total of 58 cNFs from 13 participants with NF1 were selected for imaging and analysis. The primary endpoint was accuracy as measured by comparison of measurements between imaging systems. Secondary endpoints included reliability between two operators, precision as measured with the average coefficient of variation, feasibility as determined by time to capture and analyse an image and accessibility as determined by cost. There was no significant difference in accuracy between the three devices for length or surface area measurements (p > 0.05), and reliability and precision were similar. Volume measurements demonstrated the most variability compared to other measurements; LifeViz-Micro demonstrated the least measurement variability for surface area and image capture and analysis were fastest with LifeViz-Micro. LifeViz-Micro was better for imaging smaller number of cNFs (1-3), Vectra-H1 better for larger areas and Cherry for uneven surfaces. All systems demonstrated excellent reliability but possess distinct advantages and limitations. Surface area is the most consistent and reliable parameter for measuring cNF size in clinical trials."

As an autosomal dominant condition, it involves mutations in the neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) tumor-suppressor gene, inherited in a recessive manner. Plexiform neurofibroma is a rare manifestation. It is a benign peripheral nerve sheath tumor that grows beneath the skin or deeper within tissues without clear boundaries. The diverse presentations of NF1 necessitate careful, personalized medical management to address the disorder's effects on various organs. Due to its progressive nature, early diagnosis is crucial to prevent complications.

The remainder are attributed to various causes, including vasculitis, connective tissue disease, and neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1). NF-1 is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by distinct clinical manifestations that occasionally include life-threatening vascular complications. Although NF-1 patients may develop various vascular abnormalities, ruptured ITAA is rarely reported, with only seven published cases. A 32-year-old man with NF-1 consulted for a three-day history of persistent left back and upper arm pain. Initial chest radiography indicated left pleural effusion and an opacity at the left lung apex. Computed tomography scan revealed a mass in the left upper mediastinum that was initially suspected to be a tumor. Subsequent contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed the mass to be a subclavian artery aneurysm. Detailed contrast-enhanced computed tomography with 1-mm slices was performed for surgical planning, identifying the mass as a left ITAA with contained rupture. Given the risk of re-rupture, emergency angiography was performed, which confirmed rupture of the left ITAA without extravasation. The ITAA was successfully treated with multiple microcoils at the proximal and distal ends. The patient had an uneventful recovery and was discharged on the fourth postoperative day. This case highlights the importance of considering vascular lesions in NF-1 patients who present with pleural effusion. It also emphasizes the challenges in diagnosing ITAA and the effectiveness of thin-slice contrast-enhanced computed tomography scans and endovascular treatment."

    "abstract": "Noonan syndrome and neurofibromatosis type 1 are genetic conditions linked to pathogenic variants in genes of the Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase signalling pathway. Both conditions hyper-activate signalling of the Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway and exhibit a high prevalence of neuropsychiatric disorders. Further, animal models of Noonan syndrome and neurofibromatosis type 1 and human imaging studies show white matter abnormalities in both conditions. While these findings suggest Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinas pathway hyper-activation effects on white matter, it is unknown whether these effects are syndrome-specific or pathway-specific. To characterize the effect of Noonan syndrome and neurofibromatosis type 1 on human white matter's microstructural integrity and discern potential syndrome-specific influences on microstructural integrity of individual tracts, we collected diffusion-weighted imaging data from children with Noonan syndrome (<i>n</i> = 24), neurofibromatosis type 1 (<i>n</i> = 28) and age- and sex-matched controls (<i>n</i> = 31). We contrasted the clinical groups (Noonan syndrome or neurofibromatosis type 1) and controls using voxel-wise, tract-based and along-tract analyses. Outcomes included voxel-wise, tract-based and along-tract fractional anisotropy, axial diffusivity, radial diffusivity and mean diffusivity. Noonan syndrome and neurofibromatosis type 1 showed similar patterns of reduced fractional anisotropy and increased axial diffusivity, radial diffusivity, and mean diffusivity on white matter relative to controls and different spatial patterns. Noonan syndrome presented a more extensive spatial effect than neurofibromatosis type 1 on white matter integrity as measured by fractional anisotropy. Tract-based analysis also demonstrated differences in effect magnitude with overall lower fractional anisotropy in Noonan syndrome compared to neurofibromatosis type 1 (<i>d</i> = 0.4). At the tract level, Noonan syndrome-specific effects on fractional anisotropy were detected in association tracts (superior longitudinal, uncinate and arcuate fasciculi; <i>P</i> < 0.012), and neurofibromatosis type 1-specific effects were detected in the corpus callosum (<i>P</i> < 0.037) compared to controls. Results from along-tract analyses aligned with results from tract-based analyses and indicated that effects are pervasive along the affected tracts. In conclusion, we find that pathogenic variants in the Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway are associated with white matter abnormalities as measured by diffusion in the developing brain. Overall, Noonan syndrome and neurofibromatosis type 1 show common effects on fractional anisotropy and diffusion scalars, as well as specific unique effects, namely, on temporoparietal-frontal tracts (intra-hemispheric) in Noonan syndrome and on the corpus callosum (inter-hemispheric) in neurofibromatosis type 1. The observed specific effects not only confirm prior observations from independent cohorts of Noonan syndrome and neurofibromatosis type 1 but also inform on syndrome-specific susceptibility of individual tracts. Thus, these findings suggest potential targets for precise, brain-focused outcome measures for existing medications, such as MEK inhibitors, that act on the Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway."

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a genetic disorder that affects multiple systems in the body, often leading to physical disfigurements and a wide range of clinical symptoms. This study aims to investigate the relationship between NF1 severity and visibility and the quality of life (QoL) in children. The Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) and a modified version of the Ablon scale were used to assess QoL and NF1 severity and visibility, respectively. Self-reported and parent-reported QoL scores were compared, and the associations between NF1 severity/visibility and QoL were explored. Thirty-eight pediatric NF1 patients and their parents were enrolled. QoL scores did not differ significantly between patient self-reports and parent reports. However, correlational analyses revealed that higher NF1 severity was associated with lower physical QoL in patients, and greater NF1 visibility was linked to lower physical and social QoL. For parents, higher NF1 severity correlated with lower school functioning, whereas NF1 visibility did not show a significant correlation with QoL. The severity and visibility of NF1 have distinct impacts on various aspects of QoL in children, highlighting the need for tailored interventions that address both physical and psychological challenges. These findings underscore the importance of comprehensive care approaches in managing NF1 in pediatric populations."

We retrospectively investigated anthropometrics in CAYA on the National Cancer Institute (NCI) NF1 Natural History Study who had pNF TV assessed by imaging (n = 106). We determined CDC height/weight percentiles and estimated Preece-Baines (PB) height growth curve parameters. We evaluated variables that could impact height/weight including: (1) pNF volume, (2) pNF directed therapy, and (3) serum IGF-1. 23% of males and 20% of females had height <5th percentile; 13% of males had weight <5th percentile. Estimated median final adult height for males was 171.6 cm (CDC 23rd percentile) and for females was 156.2 cm (CDC 14th percentile). Inverse associations between height and weight percentiles and pNF volume were observed (Spearman's r = -0.277, -0.216, respectively). Estimated median final height was not meaningfully affected by patients who received pNF-directed treatment with MEK inhibitor. 52% of low serum IGF-1 measurements were concurrent with a height percentile <5th. Greater than expected percentages of patients had height/weight <5th percentile, and median final adult heights were <CDC 25th percentile. pNF volume was inversely associated with height/weight percentiles. Children and adolescents/young adults with neurofibromatosis type I (NF1) seen at a research hospital have lower height and weight percentiles than normative populations. Growth percentiles are inversely associated with plexiform neurofibroma tumor volumes and impacted little by MEKi treatment history in this subset of patients. These findings align with prior investigations of growth in the NF1 population but are the first to examine the association with tumor burden."

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), Noonan syndrome, and related syndromes, grouped as RASopathies, result from dysregulation of the RAS-MAPK pathway and demonstrate varied multisystemic clinical phenotypes. Together, RASopathies are among the more prevalent genetic cancer predisposition syndromes and require nuanced clinical management. When compared with the general population, children with RASopathies are at significantly increased risk of benign and malignant neoplasms. In the past decade, clinical trials have shown that targeted therapies can improve outcomes for low-grade and benign neoplastic lesions but have their own challenges, highlighting the multidisciplinary care needed for such individuals, specifically those with NF1. This perspective, which originated from the 2023 American Association for Cancer Research Childhood Cancer Predisposition Workshop, serves to update pediatric oncologists, neurologists, geneticists, counselors, and other health care professionals on revised diagnostic criteria, review previously published surveillance guidelines, and harmonize updated surveillance recommendations for patients with NF1 or RASopathies."

    "title": "Cutaneous Neurofibromas and Quality of Life in Adults With Neurofibromatosis Type 1.",
    "abstract": "There is a burgeoning interest in therapeutic development for cutaneous neurofibromas (cNFs), a major cause of morbidity in persons with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). To determine meaningful clinical trial outcomes, deeper understanding is needed regarding how cNFs are associated with quality of life (QoL). However, this understanding has been hampered by challenges in recruiting participants with this rare genetic disease. To develop a large, crowdsourced validated registry of persons with NF1 and determine the association of specific cNF features with QoL, pain, and itch. From May 2021 to December 2023, a decentralized platform was developed and recruited persons 40 years or older with NF1 and at least 1 cNF from 49 states and 12 countries, who provided clinical survey data, detailed photographs, and genetic sequencing data. Photographs from 583 participants were scored on 12 features of cNFs, including general severity, number, size, facial severity, color, and subtypes. cNF features derived from participant-supplied photographs. Total Skindex scores and subdomain scores (symptoms, emotion, function, pain, and itch). Of 583 participants, 384 (65.9%) were female, and the mean (range) age was 51.7 (40.0-83.0) years. Female sex, general severity, number, size, and facial severity of cNFs were negatively associated with QoL, as demonstrated by increased total Skindex scores. QoL had the largest association with the number of cNFs and presence of facial cNFs. Increasing number of cNFs was associated with worse QoL, and even individuals with a low cNF burden (<10 total cNFs) experienced a decrease in QoL. The results of this study suggest that reducing cNF number, particularly on the face, may be associated with improved QoL in individuals with NF1. In addition, early intervention before the development of numerous tumors may lead to the highest benefit in QoL. These data potentially provide insight into which individuals and cNF tumors may benefit most from therapy and highlights the utility of a completely decentralized, photograph-validated and age-controlled study for rare genetic disease. This cohort will allow analysis of disease and tumor heterogeneity after full phenotypic expression is achieved in NF1 and potentially serves as an example in its design for other rare diseases that struggle from poor recruitment."

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) is a rare genetic syndrome that leads to the development of neurofibromas and increases the risk of malignancy, including malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors. Patients with NF1 often have other orthopaedic manifestations, including short stature, osteopenia, and dysplasia. A 47-year-old patient with a history of NF1 and multiple neurofibromas of the right lower extremity presented with a severe valgus deformity, instability, and osteoarthritis of the right knee that was debilitating to daily life. Over time, the patient lost proprioception and potentially some sensation to the right knee with neurofibroma formation, leading to the development of Charcot arthropathy of the right knee with secondary osteoarthritis. The preoperative workup consisted of a magnetic resonance imaging of the knee to confirm no malignancy was present and templating to ensure the standard implant size was amenable for the patient. A primary total knee arthroplasty was performed with a cemented-stemmed hinged knee implant. At 6 months post-surgery, the patient had a dramatic improvement in her pain and quality of life."

    "abstract": "Although gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) has been reported in patients of all ages, its diagnosis is more common in elders. The two most common types of mutation, receptor tyrosine kinase (KIT) and platelet-derived growth factor receptor a (PDGFRA) mutations, hold about 75 and 15% of GISTs cases, respectively. Tumors without KIT or PDGFRA mutations are known as wild type (WT)-GISTs, which takes up for 15% of all cases. WT-GISTs have other genetic alterations, including mutations of the succinate dehydrogenase and serine-threonine protein kinase BRAF and neurofibromatosis type 1. Other GISTs without any of the above genetic mutations are named \"quadruple WT\" GISTs. More types of rare mutations are being reported. These mutations or gene fusions were initially thought to be mutually exclusive in primary GISTs, but recently it has been reported that some of these rare mutations coexist with KIT or PDGFRA mutations. The treatment and management differ according to molecular subtypes of GISTs. Especially for patients with late-stage tumors, developing a personalized chemotherapy regimen based on mutation status is of great help to improve patient survival and quality of life. At present, imatinib mesylate is an effective first-line drug for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic recurrent GISTs, but how to overcome drug resistance is still an important clinical problem. The effectiveness of other drugs is being further evaluated. The progress in the study of relevant mechanisms also provides the possibility to develop new targets or new drugs."

In mental health care settings, however, aside from a few highly specialized centres, the diagnosis and treatment of individuals with NF1 receives little attention, while the need for psychological treatment is increasingly identified, both in clinical practice and in the scientific literature. Occasional referrals of individuals with NF1 to the mental health services are often only targeted at psychological assessment. Subsequent treatment, however, is usually lacking. We describe two individuals with NF1 for whom by means of specialized clinical neuropsychological assessment, participation in a tailored dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) skills training was indicated. We exposit how they were able to develop their skills and how they themselves and their significant others experienced the treatment."

These masses involve surrounding connective tissue or dermal layers, leading to multiple cutaneous changes and certain characteristic appearances. It is these appearances that aid in the diagnosis of PF. We have encountered two distinct patients diagnosed with this disorder. While one patient was clinically and pathologically confirmed for PF, the other had no characteristic cutaneous changes. The diagnosis was made with postoperative histopathology and confirmed with an immunohistochemical examination. There are various modalities in the management of PFs, with surgery being a mainstay in the treatment of disfiguring large PFs, especially in resource-restrained settings. In view of high recurrence rates, postoperative clinical follow-up is a must. This paper describes these patients' typical and atypical clinical presentation and subsequent management."

    "abstract": "Genetic disorders such as neurofibromatosis type 1 increase vulnerability to cognitive and behavioral disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Neurofibromatosis type 1 results from loss-of-function mutations in the neurofibromin gene and subsequent reduction in the neurofibromin protein (Nf1). While the mechanisms have yet to be fully elucidated, loss of Nf1 may alter neuronal circuit activity leading to changes in behavior and susceptibility to cognitive and behavioral comorbidities. Here we show that mutations decreasing Nf1 expression alter motor behaviors, impacting the patterning, prioritization, and behavioral state dependence in a <i>Drosophila</i> model of neurofibromatosis type 1. Loss of Nf1 increases spontaneous grooming in a nonlinear spatial and temporal pattern, differentially increasing grooming of certain body parts, including the abdomen, head, and wings. This increase in grooming could be overridden by hunger in food-deprived foraging animals, demonstrating that the Nf1 effect is plastic and internal state-dependent. Stimulus-evoked grooming patterns were altered as well, with <i>nf1</i> mutants exhibiting reductions in wing grooming when coated with dust, suggesting that hierarchical recruitment of grooming command circuits was altered. Yet loss of Nf1 in sensory neurons and/or grooming command neurons did not alter grooming frequency, suggesting that Nf1 affects grooming via higher-order circuit alterations. Changes in grooming coincided with alterations in walking. Flies lacking Nf1 walked with increased forward velocity on a spherical treadmill, yet there was no detectable change in leg kinematics or gait. Thus, loss of Nf1 alters motor function without affecting overall motor coordination, in contrast to other genetic disorders that impair coordination. Overall, these results demonstrate that loss of Nf1 alters the patterning and prioritization of repetitive behaviors, in a state-dependent manner, without affecting motor coordination."

We aim to establish an association between heterozygous loss-of-function LZTR1 alleles and isolated multiple café-au-lait macules (CaLMs). A total of 849 unrelated participants with multiple CaLMs, lacking pathogenic/likely pathogenic NF1 and SPRED1 variants, underwent RASopathy gene panel sequencing. Data on 125 individuals with heterozygous LZTR1 variants were collected for characterizing their clinical features and the associated molecular spectrum. In vitro functional assessment was performed on a representative panel of missense variants and small in-frame deletions. Analysis revealed heterozygous LZTR1 variants in 6.0% (51/849) of participants, exceeding the general population prevalence. LZTR1-related CaLMs varied in number, displayed sharp or irregular borders, and were generally isolated but occasionally associated with features recurring in RASopathies. In 2 families, CaLMs and schwannomas co-occurred. The molecular spectrum mainly consisted of truncating variants, indicating loss-of-function. These variants substantially overlapped with those occurring in schwannomatosis and recessive NS. Functional characterization showed accelerated protein degradation or mislocalization, and failure to downregulate mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling. Our findings expand the phenotypic variability associated with LZTR1 variants, which, in addition to conferring susceptibility to schwannomatosis and causing dominant and recessive NS, occur in individuals with isolated multiple CaLMs."

    "abstract": "Iris nodules are frequently noted as clinical manifestations of neurofibromatosis type 1 but the other intraocular manifestations are rare. The purpose of this study is to present a patient with a phthisic eye who underwent enucleation for a cosmetic reason after 15-year follow-up and also to review 14 patients with enucleation described in the literature. A 17-year-old man with neurofibromatosis type 1 from infancy underwent the enucleation of phthisic left eye and also had the resection of eyelid subcutaneous mass lesions on the left side for a cosmetic reason. He had undergone four-time preceding surgeries for eyelid and orbital mass reduction on the left side in childhood and had developed total retinal detachment 10 years previously. Pathologically, the enucleated eye showed massive retinal gliosis positive for both S-100 and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in the area with involvement of the detached retinal neuronal layer, together with a more fibrotic lesion along the choroid which were, in contrast, negative for both S-100 and GFAP. The choroid, ciliary body, and iris did not show apparent neurofibroma while episcleral neurofibroma was present. In review of enucleated eyes of 14 patients in the literature, buphthalmic eyes with early-onset glaucoma on the unilateral side was clinically diagnosed in 9 patients who frequently showed varying extent of hemifacial neurofibromatosis which involved the eyelid and orbit on the same side. Pathologically, neurofibromas in varying extent were found in the choroid of 12 patients. One patient showed choroidal malignant melanoma on the left side and fusiform enlargement of the optic nerve on the right side suspected of optic nerve glioma. The phthisic eye in another patient showed massive retinal gliosis similar to the present patient. In summary of the 15 patients with neurofibromatosis type 1, including the present patient, buphthalmic or phthisic eyes with no vision were enucleated for cosmetic reasons and showed choroidal neurofibroma in most patients and massive retinal gliosis in two patients including the present patient."

    "abstract": "Juvenile pilocytic astrocytoma (JPA) is the most common primary brain tumor of childhood and is rarely seen in adults. Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), a common tumor predisposition syndrome, demonstrates a strong association with low-grade gliomas, most notably pilocytic astrocytoma, which are relatively indolent. Unlike its juvenile counterpart, reports of adult pilocytic astrocytoma (APA) vary widely in terms of disease progression from benign to much more malignant courses. Moreover, current studies discussing APA report different treatment approaches and outcomes (e.g., malignant transformation of JPA and APA with or without radiation), as little is known regarding the management of recurrent tumors and how adjuvant therapies may alter disease progression. The authors report the unique case of an adult male with NF1 and APA who underwent rapid malignant conversion after intensity-modulated radiation therapy. The authors demonstrate that caution should be taken in utilizing radiotherapy instead of resection in cases of APA and NF1, with close monitoring for posttreatment recurrence. https://thejns.org/doi/10.3171/CASE24241."

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a genetic disorder caused by mutation of the NF1 gene that is associated with various symptoms, including the formation of benign tumors, called neurofibromas, within nerves. Drug treatments are currently limited. The mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor selumetinib is used for a subset of plexiform neurofibromas (PNs) but is not always effective and can cause side effects. Therefore, there is a clear need to discover new drugs to target NF1-deficient tumor cells. Using a Drosophila cell model of NF1, we performed synthetic lethal screens to identify novel drug targets. We identified 54 gene candidates, which were validated with variable dose analysis as a secondary screen. Pathways associated with five candidates could be targeted using existing drugs. Among these, chloroquine (CQ) and bafilomycin A1, known to target the autophagy pathway, showed the greatest potential for selectively killing NF1-deficient Drosophila cells. When further investigating autophagy-related genes, we found that 14 out of 30 genes tested had a synthetic lethal interaction with NF1. These 14 genes are involved in multiple aspects of the autophagy pathway and can be targeted with additional drugs that mediate the autophagy pathway, although CQ was the most effective. The lethal effect of autophagy inhibitors was conserved in a panel of human NF1-deficient Schwann cell lines, highlighting their translational potential. The effect of CQ was also conserved in a Drosophila NF1 in vivo model and in a xenografted NF1-deficient tumor cell line grown in mice, with CQ treatment resulting in a more significant reduction in tumor growth than selumetinib treatment. Furthermore, combined treatment with CQ and selumetinib resulted in a further reduction in NF1-deficient cell viability. In conclusion, NF1-deficient cells are vulnerable to disruption of the autophagy pathway. This pathway represents a promising target for the treatment of NF1-associated tumors, and we identified CQ as a candidate drug for the treatment of NF1 tumors."

Microscopically, the dermal tumor consists of bland spindle cells with thin, wavy nuclei, without atypia, showing S100 immunoreactivity, consistent with neurofibroma. Multiple metaplastic bone formation composed of mature bone trabeculae surrounding adipose tissue were apparent. Up to date, ossification of neurofibroma has been scarcely reported in literature. The etiology is unclear but might involve the response to chronic stress and tissue damage over the years, and/or might indicate the potential differentiation plasticity of mesenchymal stem cell-like population.

Available audiometric data were reviewed from patients with NF1 seen at a tertiary pediatric hospital to assess prevalence and risk factors for hearing loss. Of 1172 patients with NF1 seen between 2010 and 2022, 90 had available audiometric data and 48 of 90 patients (53%) had one or more audiogram revealing hearing loss. Those not referred to audiology were presumed to have normal hearing, resulting in a conservative hearing loss estimate of 4% for children and young adults with NF1. Of 90 patients with audiograms, 29 (32%) had conductive loss (CHL), 15 (17%) had sensorineural loss (SNHL), and 3 (3%) had mixed hearing loss. Hearing loss type was undetermined for one patient. For children with CHL, six had permanent CHL secondary to plexiform neurofibroma, 19 CHL were transient due to active middle ear dysfunction, and four CHL cases were indeterminate in etiology. For three children with SNHL or mixed hearing loss, etiology included history of ototoxic chemotherapy and/or family history of SNHL. In the 16 patients with SNHL or mixed hearing loss with more than one audiogram over time, progressive hearing decline was noted in eight of 16, and 26 of 178 hearing thresholds (15%) progressed. Our findings suggest that audiometric evaluations should be considered for at least a subset of children with NF1, given the higher-than-expected rate of hearing loss in patients with NF1 compared with the general population."

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) is a complex genetic disorder characterized by the development of benign neurofibromas, which can cause significant morbidity in affected individuals. While the molecular mechanisms underlying NF1 pathogenesis have been extensively studied, the development of effective therapeutic strategies remains a challenge. This paper presents the development and validation of a novel biomaterial testing model to enhance our understanding of NF1 pathophysiology, disease mechanisms and evaluate potential therapeutic interventions. Our long-term goal is to develop an invitro model of NF1 to evaluate drug targets. We have developed an in vitro system to test the cellular behavior of NF1 patient derived cells on electroconductive aligned nanofibrous biomaterials with electrical stimulatory cues. We hypothesized that cells cultured on electroconductive biomaterial will undergo morphological changes and variations in cell proliferation that could be further enhanced with the combination of exogenous electrical stimulation (ES). In this study, we developed electrospun Hyaluronic Acid-Carbon Nanotube (HA-CNT) nanofiber scaffolds to mimic the axon's topographical and bioelectrical cues that influence neurofibroma growth and development. The cellular behavior was qualitatively and quantitively analyzed through immunofluorescent stains, Alamar blue assays and ELISA assays. Schwann cells from NF1 patients appear to have lost their ability to respond to electrical stimulation in the development and regeneration range, which was seen through changes in morphology, proliferation and NGF release. Without stimulation, the conductive material enhances NF1 SC behavior. Wild-type SC respond to electrical stimulation with increased cell proliferation and NGF release. Using this system, we can better understand the interaction between axons and SC that lead to tumor formation, homeostasis and regeneration."

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a human genetic disorder caused by variants in the NF1 gene. Plexiform neurofibromas, one of many NF1 manifestations, are benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors occurring in up to 50% of NF1 patients. A substantial fraction of NF1 pathogenetic variants are nonsense mutations, which result in the synthesis of truncated non-functional NF1 protein (neurofibromin). To date, no therapeutics have restored neurofibromin expression or addressed the consequences of this protein's absence in NF1 nonsense mutation patients, but nonsense suppression is a potential approach to the problem. Ataluren is a small molecule drug that has been shown to stimulate functional nonsense codon readthrough in several models of nonsense mutation diseases, as well as in Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients. To test ataluren's potential applicability in nonsense mutation NF1 patients, we evaluated its therapeutic effects using three treatment regimens in a previously established NF1 patient-derived (c.2041C > T; p.Arg681X) nonsense mutation mouse model. Collectively, our experiments indicate that: i) ataluren appeared to slow the growth of neurofibromas and alleviate some paralysis phenotypes, ii) female Nf1-nonsense mutation mice manifested more severe paralysis and neurofibroma phenotypes than male mice, iii) ataluren doses with apparent effectiveness were lower in female mice than in male mice, and iv) age factors also influenced ataluren's effectiveness."

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF type 1) is an autosomal dominant disease with typical clinical manifestations, such as skin lesions, Lisch nodules, optic pathway gliomas, and neurofibromas, caused by the mutation of the NF1 gene. Visual evoked potentials (VEP) present a measure of the electrophysiological response of visual cortex to a visual stimulus. The role of VEP in the pathophysiology of NF type 1 is very complex and requires additional research. We examined the differences between NF type 1 patients with normal and altered VEP and analyzed the correlation between the prolongation of P100 latency and disease severity. Two groups were formed: a control group and a study group with NF type 1 patients. Based on the control group analysis, a threshold value for a normal VEP finding of 116 ms was obtained, and it was used to divide the study group into subgroups with normal and altered VEP. We proceeded with examining the differences in clinical manifestations of the disease between the subgroups, after which we checked if there is a correlation between the prolongation of the P100 latency and the severity of the clinical picture according to the Riccardi scale. Statistical analysis was performed using the Pearson chi-square test and the Spearman correlation test in the program SPSS 28.0, with levels of statistical significance <i>p</i> = 0.05 and <i>p</i> = 0.001. In the group with the abnormal VEP we found a statistically significant more frequent occurrence of optic tract glioma (<i>p</i> = 0.008), tumors (<i>p</i> = 0.032), epilepsy (<i>p</i> = 0.043), and cognitive disorders (<i>p</i> = 0.028), while the other clinical signs had an equal prevalence in both groups. A moderately strong correlation (<i>r</i> <sub>s</sub> = 0.665) was observed between the prolongation of P100 latency and the severity of the clinical picture. Our results showed the important role of VEP in the description of clinical phenotypes of NF type 1. The authors of the study propose VEP to be included in the diagnostic algorithms designed for patients with NF type 1."

    "abstract": "Cauda equina neuroendocrine tumors (CENETs), previously known as cauda equina paragangliomas, and multiple cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs) are uncommon conditions affecting the central nervous system. To the authors' knowledge, they have not been reported in the same patient. The authors present the case of a 45-year-old male with CENET and concurrent incidental MRI findings of multiple CCMs. Familial CCMs are associated with mutations in the KRIT1 (CCM1), MGC4607 (CCM2), and PDCD10 (CCM3) genes. Peripheral paragangliomas have been associated with mutations in succinate dehydrogenase (SDHx), RET (multiple endocrine neoplasia 2), VHL (von Hippel-Lindau syndrome), and NF1 (neurofibromatosis type 1) genes. Except for a single case, cauda equina paragangliomas have not been associated with any underlying genetic mutations. It is unclear whether the co-occurrence of these two rare conditions in the same patient is coincidental or suggests a possible shared pathogenesis. https://thejns.org/doi/10.3171/CASE24102."

    "title": "Malignant Transformation of Plexiform Neurofibroma Due to Neglected Giant Soft Tissue Swelling of the Back: A Case Report.",
    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 can be severe and associated with malignant transformation. Proper follow-up and monitoring are very important in preventing the malignant transformation of neurofibromatosis. We encountered a case of malignant transformation of plexiform neurofibroma into neurofibrosarcoma (also known as malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor). She had been presenting with a large mass on her back for a few years, which was also associated with an ulcer. She underwent a wide-excision biopsy of her back, and the histopathology examination (HPE) came back with a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor. This case concludes that any patient with a known case of neurofibromatosis should undergo follow-up to detect any malignant transformation of the disease. Early detection of the malignant transformation of neurofibromatosis can help prevent the disease's progression. The main treatment is surgical resection; however, the risk of local recurrence is higher, especially in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1."

    "abstract": "Plexiform neurofibromas (PNFs) are a prevalent and severe phenotype associated with NF1, characterized by a high teratogenic rate and potential for malignant transformation. The growth and recurrence of PNFs are attributed to aberrant proliferation and migration of Nf1-deficient Schwann cells. Protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor S (PTPRS) is believed to modulate cell migration and invasion by inhibiting the EMT process in NF1-derived malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors. Nevertheless, the specific role of PTPRS in NF1-derived PNFs remains to be elucidated. The study utilized the GEO database and tissue microarray to illustrate a decrease in PTPRS expression in PNF tissues, linked to tumor recurrence. Furthermore, the down- and over-expression of PTPRS in Nf1-deficient Schwann cell lines resulted in the changes of cell migration and EMT processes. Additionally, RTK assay and WB showed that PTPRS knockdown can promote EGFR expression and phosphorylation. The restoration of EMT processes disrupted by alterations in PTPRS levels in Schwann cells can be achieved through EGFR knockdown and EGFR inhibitor. Moreover, high EGFR expression has been significantly correlated with poor prognosis. These findings underscore the potential role of PTPRS as a tumor suppressor in the recurrence of PNF via the regulation of EGFR-mediated EMT processes, suggesting potential targets for future clinical interventions."

    "abstract": "Early detection of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)-associated peripheral nerve sheath tumors (PNST) informs clinical decision-making, enabling early definitive treatment and potentially averting deadly outcomes. In this study, we describe a cell-free DNA (cfDNA) fragmentomic approach that distinguishes nonmalignant, premalignant, and malignant forms of PNST in the cancer predisposition syndrome, NF1. cfDNA was isolated from plasma samples of a novel cohort of 101 patients with NF1 and 21 healthy controls and underwent whole-genome sequencing. We investigated diagnosis-specific signatures of copy-number alterations with in silico size selection as well as fragment profiles. Fragmentomics were analyzed using complementary feature types: bin-wise fragment size ratios, end motifs, and fragment non-negative matrix factorization signatures. The novel cohort of patients with NF1 validated that our previous cfDNA copy-number alteration-based approach identifies malignant PNST (MPNST) but cannot distinguish between benign and premalignant states. Fragmentomic methods were able to differentiate premalignant states including atypical neurofibromas (AN). Fragmentomics also adjudicated AN cases suspicious for MPNST, correctly diagnosing samples noninvasively, which could have informed clinical management. Novel cfDNA fragmentomic signatures distinguish AN from benign plexiform neurofibromas and MPNST, enabling more precise clinical diagnosis and management. This study pioneers the early detection of malignant and premalignant PNST in NF1 and provides a blueprint for decentralizing noninvasive cancer surveillance in hereditary cancer predisposition syndromes."

    "abstract": "<b>Objective:</b> To investigate the clinical and radiologic characteristics of children with congenital pseudarthrosis of the tibia (CPT) in a single center. <b>Methods:</b> This is a retrospective case series study. According to inclusion and exclusion criteria, clinical data of 497 children(507 limbs) with CPT who were treated at Department of Orthopedics, the Children's Hospital Affiliated to Xiangya School of Medicine, Central South University from January 2011 to December 2020 were collected. Baseline data included gender, age at initial visit, age at onset of symptoms, accompanying symptoms, domicile, whether first treated at our hospital, and treatment-related information such as surgical or conservative treatment, surgical complications, etc., were extracted and analyzed using the health information system. Imaging data of the children, including Crawford classification, bilateral leg lengths, presence of fibular pseudarthrosis, and location of pseudarthrosis along the tibia segment, were analyzed using the Picture Archiving and Communication System. Data were compared using independent sample <i>t</i> test or <i>χ</i><sup>2</sup> tests. <b>Results:</b> Among 497 children with CPT, there were 305 males (61.4%) and 192 females (38.6%). The age at initial visit was (3.6±3.2) years (range: 0.1 to 16.2 years). Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) symptoms were positive in 340 children (68.4%), and negative in 157 children (31.6%). Among NF1-positive children, those with symptoms onset before 1 year of age were significantly more than NF1-negative children (74.1%(252/340) <i>vs</i>. 66.2%(104/157);<i>χ</i><sup>2</sup>=9.24, <i>P</i>=0.001), and the proportion of fractures (92.9%,316/340) was significantly higher than that in the NF1-negative group (84.7%,133/157) (<i>χ</i><sup>2</sup>=8.33, <i>P</i>=0.004). According to imaging data, Crawford type Ⅳ was the most common type, with 321 limbs (63.3%), followed by type Ⅱ in 100 limbs (19.7%), type Ⅲ in 54 limbs (10.7%) and type Ⅰ in 32 limbs (6.3%). Pseudarthrosis occurred in the proximal third of the tibia in 14 limbs (2.8%), in the middle third in 185 limbs (36.5%), and in the distal third in 308 limbs (60.8%). Seventy-four children (14.9 %) had associated fibular pseudarthrosis. The lateral proximal tibial angle was 86.91°±5.21°(range: 72.17° to 102.08°), and the lateral distal tibial angle was 87.27°±10.73°(range: 51.07° to 128.17°). A total of 421 children (84.7%) underwent surgical treatment with (3.1±2.4) surgeries performed per child (range:0 to 12 surgeries); 76 children (15.3%) received conservative treatment. Postoperative complications mainly included ankle valgus (77 cases), leg length discrepancy (71 cases),refracture (48 cases), osteomyelitis (11 cases), and hardware failure (10 cases). NF1-positive children underwent more surgeries than NF1-negative children ((5.1±2.2)times <i>vs</i>.(2.1±1.8)times;<i>t</i>=14.93,<i>P</i><0.01). <b>Conclusions:</b> Crawford type Ⅳ is the most common type of CPT in children in this study. CPT predominantly occurs in the middle or distal third of the tibia. The majority of children with CPT experienced symptoms and were seen at outpatient clinics before the age of 3 years. The main surgical complications currently associated with CPT treatment are ankle valgus and leg length discrepancy. Compared with CPT without NF1, children with NF1-positive CPT tend to have earlier symptom onset and may require more frequent treatments."

There is currently no known specific treatment, and treatment is based on recommendations with limited evidence. This report describes a case of vascular dysplasia in a patient with NF1. A 67-year-old woman with a genetic diagnosis of NF1 and a history of multiple exeresis of neurofibromas in the left cervical region. The patient presented with a painful flare-up and swelling in the region. A cervical magnetic resonance imaging was performed, which showed signs of plexiform neurinoma growth and a lesion suggestive of aneurysm in the left cervical internal carotid artery. A subsequent computed tomographic angiography confirmed the presence of a thrombosed aneurysm with associated critical stenosis, and identified three additional aneurysms in the proximal left vertebral artery. Given the asymptomatic presentation and adequate haemodynamic compensation, the patient was prescribed a conservative treatment and clinicoradiological follow-up. Neurovascular alterations associated with NF1 are infrequent, and the optimal treatment for them is unknown. Studies to define its true prevalence, determine its pathophysiological substrate and estimate the risk of cerebrovascular complications more precisely are needed. This could provide more robust recommendations for the population of NF1 patients, especially in asymptomatic cases."

    "abstract": "Plexiform neurofibromas (PNs) occur in about a half of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) patients and have garnered significant research attention due to their capacity for growth and potential for malignant transformation. NF1 plexiform neurofibroma (pNF1) is a complex tumor composed of Schwann cell-derived tumor cells (<i>Nf1</i><sup>-/-</sup>) and the tumor microenvironment (TME). Although it has been widely demonstrated that the TME is involved in the formation of neurofibromas, little is known about the effects of the TME on the subsequent progression of human pNF1. Elucidating the molecular interactions between tumor cells and the TME may provide new therapeutic targets to reduce the progression of pNF1. In the present study, we focused on the contributions of fibroblasts, the most abundant cell types in the TME, to the growth of pNF1. To simulate the TME, we used a three-dimensional (3D) coculture model of immortalized pNF1 tumor cells (<i>Nf1</i><sup>-/-</sup>) and primary fibroblasts (<i>Nf1<sup>+/-</sup></i>) derived from pNF1 patients. We performed live-cell imaging of 3D/4D (3D in real-time) cultures through confocal microscopy followed by 3D quantitative analyses using advanced imaging software. The growth of pNF1 spheroids in 3D cocultures with fibroblasts was significantly greater than that of pNF1 spheroids in 3D monocultures. An increase in the growth of pNF1 spheroids also occurred when they were cultured with conditioned media (CM) from fibroblasts. Moreover, fibroblast-derived CM increased the invasive outgrowth and further local invasion of pNF1 spheroids. Interestingly, when small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) were depleted from the fibroblast-derived CM, the stimulation of the growth of pNF1 spheroids was lost. Our results suggest that fibroblast-derived sEVs are a therapeutic target for reducing the growth of pNF1."

The aim of this longitudinal study was to evaluate whether PhNR deteriorates over time in OPG patients. Fourteen pediatric patients affected by OPG (4 males and 10 females, mean age 12.4 ± 5.7 years, 8 with neurofibromatosis type 1 [NF1]) with ≥12 months of follow-up and ≥2 evaluations, were included in this retrospective study. All patients had received chemotherapy, with or without OPG surgical resection, at least 5 years prior to the study. At baseline, all patients underwent a complete ophthalmological examination. Follow-up included clinical examination and PhNR measurement as well as brain MRI (according to pediatric oncologist indications) every 6 or 12 months. Mean follow-up duration was 16.7 ± 7.5 months (range 12-36 months). Photopic electroretinograms were elicited by 2.0 cd-s/m<sup>2</sup> Ganzfeld white flashes presented on a steady 20 cd/m<sup>2</sup> white background. The PhNR amplitude was measured as the difference between baseline and the maximal negative amplitude (minimum) of the negative wave, following the photopic b-wave. Compared to baseline, mean PhNR amplitude was significantly decreased at the end of follow-up (p = 0.008). NF1-related OPGs exhibited a decline in PhNR amplitude (p = 0.005) and an increase in PhNR peak-time during the follow-up (p = 0.013), whereas sporadic OPGs showed no significant changes. Tumor size remained stable in all patients on MRI. PhNR amplitude decreased over the observation period, suggesting progressive RGC dysfunction in NF1-related pediatric OPGs, despite stable size on MRI imaging. PhNR could serve as a non-invasive objective tool for assessing longitudinal changes in RGC function in the clinical management of childhood OPG."

Disordered sleep is common in intellectual disability and, given the importance of sleep for cognitive function, it may contribute to other behavioral phenotypes. Animal models of intellectual disability, in particular of monogenic intellectual disability syndromes (MIDS), recapitulate many disease phenotypes and have been invaluable for linking some of these phenotypes to specific molecular pathways. An emerging feature of MIDS, in both animal models and humans, is the prevalence of metabolic abnormalities, which could be relevant for behavior. Focusing on specific MIDS that have been molecularly characterized, we review sleep, circadian, and metabolic phenotypes in animal models and humans and propose that altered metabolic state contributes to the abnormal sleep/circadian phenotypes in MIDS."

This report presents the unique case of a 33-year-old male with progressive dry cough, hoarseness, and neck swelling who underwent a total thyroidectomy, revealing a high-grade malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor invading the thyroid. FDG PET/CT led to the additional diagnosis of NF1. This case stands out due to the rarity of finding an MPNST within the thyroid and the simultaneous identification of NF1. It underscores the importance of screening MPNST patients for NF1 and vice versa, spotlighting the expanding role of FDG PET/CT in comprehensive evaluations. To our knowledge, this report presents the first case of NF1-associated MPNST with thyroid involvement worldwide."

Although a partial clinical overlap exists with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), Legius syndrome is distinguished by its genetic etiology and the absence of neurofibromas, indicating an inherent lack of tumor risk. The SPRED1 gene encodes the Sprouty-related protein with an EVH1 domain 1 (SPRED1), a negative regulator of the RAS-MAPK signaling pathway with a crucial role in cellular growth and development. Despite various genetic variants and genomic deletions associated with Legius syndrome, the full genetic spectrum of this condition remains elusive. In this study, we investigated the underlying genetic etiology in a cohort of patients presenting with typical manifestations of Legius syndrome using a custom Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) panel and Multiplex Ligation-Dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) for NF1 and SPRED1. We identified 12 novel SPRED1 damaging variants segregating with the phenotype in all families. These rare variants affect conserved residues of the protein and are predicted damaging according to in silico tools. No clear genotype-phenotype correlations could be observed in the current cohort and previously reported patients, underscoring the heterogeneous genotype spectrum of this condition. Our findings expand the understanding of SPRED1 variants causing Legius syndrome and underscore the importance of comprehensively characterizing the genetic landscape of this disorder. Despite the absence of clear genotype-phenotype correlations, elucidating the genetic etiology of Legius syndrome is pertinent for facilitating accurate diagnosis, genetic counseling, and therapeutic interventions."

This second of three papers covers algorithms once histology is confirmed: (1) standardized whole-body staging, (2) special algorithms for non-malignant entities, and (3) multiplicity, genetic tumor syndromes, and pitfalls. A validated Delphi method based on peer-reviewed literature was used to derive consensus among a panel of 46 specialized musculoskeletal radiologists from 12 European countries. Statements that had undergone interdisciplinary revision were scored online by the level of agreement (0 to 10) during two iterative rounds, that could result in 'group consensus', 'group agreement', or 'lack of agreement'. The three sections contain 24 statements with comments. Group consensus was reached in 95.8% and group agreement in 4.2%. For whole-body staging, pulmonary MDCT should be performed in all high-grade sarcomas. Whole-body MRI is preferred for staging bone metastasis, with [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG-PET/CT as an alternative modality in PET-avid tumors. Patients with alveolar soft part sarcoma, clear cell sarcoma, and angiosarcoma should be screened for brain metastases. Special algorithms are recommended for entities such as rhabdomyosarcoma, extraskeletal Ewing sarcoma, myxoid liposarcoma, and neurofibromatosis type 1 associated malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors. Satisfaction of search should be avoided in potential multiplicity. Standardized whole-body staging includes pulmonary MDCT in all high-grade sarcomas; entity-dependent modifications and specific algorithms are recommended for sarcomas and non-malignant soft tissue tumors. These updated ESSR soft tissue tumor imaging guidelines aim to provide support in decision-making, helping to avoid common pitfalls, by providing general and entity-specific algorithms, techniques, and reporting recommendations for whole-body staging in sarcoma and non-malignant soft tissue tumors. An early, accurate, diagnosis is crucial for the prognosis of patients with soft tissue tumors. These updated guidelines provide best practice expert consensus for standardized imaging algorithms, techniques, and reporting. Standardization can improve the comparability examinations and provide databases for large data analysis."

    "abstract": "Pediatric low-grade glioma incidence has been rising in the United States, mirroring the rising rates of pediatric and maternal obesity. Recently, children of obese mothers were demonstrated to develop brain tumors at higher rates. Importantly, obesity in the United States is largely driven by diet, given the prevalence of high-fat and high-sugar (HFHS) food choices. Since high-fat diet exposure can increase embryonic neuroglial progenitor cell (NPC) proliferation, the potential cells of origin for a low-grade glioma, we hypothesized that in utero exposure to an obesogenic diet would modify pediatric brain penetrance and latency by affecting the tumor cell of origin. We employed several murine models of the neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) pediatric brain tumor predisposition syndrome, in which optic pathway gliomas (Nf1-OPGs) arise from neuroglial progenitor cells in the embryonic third ventricular zone (TVZ). We exposed dams and offspring to an obesogenic HFHS diet or control chow and analyzed fetal neurodevelopment at E19.5 and tumor formation at 6 weeks-3 months. Progeny from HFHS diet-exposed dams demonstrated increased TVZ NPC proliferation and glial differentiation. Dietary switch cohorts confirmed that these effects were dependent upon maternal diet, rather than maternal weight. Obesogenic diet (Ob) similarly accelerated glioma formation in a high-penetrance Nf1-OPG strain and increased glioma penetrance in 2 low-penetrance Nf1-OPG strains. In contrast, Ob exposure in the postnatal period alone did not recapitulate these effects. These findings establish maternal obesogenic diet as a risk factor for murine Nf1-OPG formation, acting in part through in utero effects on the tumor cell of origin."

Pathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of neurofibroma based on characteristic histopathological and immunohistochemical markers. This case report underscores the rarity of solitary neurofibromas and primary neoplasms of orbit and ocular adnexa. We also discuss the background of solitary neurofibromas originating from orbit and ocular adnexa. The successful management of this case through surgical resection highlights the importance of accurate diagnosis and tailored treatment strategies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported solitary neurofibroma confined solely to the IR tendon."

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1, a genetic disorder caused by pathogenic germline variations in NF1, predisposes individuals to the development of tumors, including cutaneous and plexiform neurofibromas (CNs and PNs), optic gliomas, astrocytomas, juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia, high-grade gliomas and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), which are chemotherapy- and radiation-resistant sarcomas with poor survival. Loss of NF1 also occurs in sporadic tumors, such as glioblastoma (GBM), melanoma, breast, ovarian and lung cancers. We performed a high-throughput screen for compounds that were synthetic lethal with NF1 loss, which identified several leads, including the small molecule Y102. Treatment of cells with Y102 perturbed autophagy, mitophagy and lysosome positioning in NF1-deficient cells. A dual proteomics approach identified BLOC-one-related complex (BORC), which is required for lysosome positioning and trafficking, as a potential target of Y102. Knockdown of a BORC subunit using siRNA recapitulated the phenotypes observed with Y102 treatment. Our findings demonstrate that BORC might be a promising therapeutic target for NF1-deficient tumors."

    "abstract": "This case report is one of the rare cases of bilateral pheochromocytoma associated with neurofibromatosis type 1. The interest lies in the clinical form in which the diagnosis was revealed. We report the case of a 38-year-old woman admitted for severe hypertension resistant to triple therapy. Clinical examination revealed Cafe-au-lait spots, which are pigmented birthmarks that appear as patches on the skin with a light to dark brown colour. More than six spots are present in an estimated 95% of people diagnosed with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed bilateral adrenal tumor involvement. The diagnosis of pheochromocytoma was made by measuring urinary Vanillylmandelic acid (VMA). The evolution was favorable after the excision of the tumor, with normalization of blood pressure. In conclusion: resistant hypertension with café au lait spots may indicate pheochromocytoma, especially bilateral, suggesting an underlying genetic condition like NF1, warranting systematic screening."

Germline <i>NF1</i> and <i>RAS</i> mutations in children with neurofibromatosis type 1 and other RASopathy developmental disorders have provided new insights into Ras biology. In many cases, these germline mutations are associated with increased cancer risk. Promising targeted therapeutic strategies for pediatric cancers and neoplasms with <i>NF1</i> or <i>RAS</i> mutations include inhibition of downstream Ras effector pathways, directly inhibiting the signal output of oncogenic Ras proteins and associated pathway members, and therapeutically targeting Ras posttranslational modifications and intracellular trafficking. Acquired drug resistance to targeted drugs remains a significant challenge but, increasingly, rational drug combination approaches have shown promise in overcoming resistance. Developing predictive preclinical models of childhood cancers for drug testing is a high priority for the field of pediatric oncology."

Neurofibromas, as a hallmark of NF1, are extremely rare in patients with other RASopathies. Here we present a case of a 39-year-old Chinese male displaying orbital neurofibromas and lumbosacral plexiform neurofibromas. Histopathology of a CT-guided biopsy of the mass revealed it to be a neurofibroma. The targeted sequencing analysis did not find any pathogenic sequence alteration in the NF1 or NF2 causative genes in blood lymphocytes and hypertrophic nerve tissue, and no additional signs of NF1 were detected, thereby not meeting the diagnostic criteria for NF1. However, we identified a heterozygous mutation (c.836A>G, p.Y279C) in the <i>PTPN11</i> gene, which is one of the key components of the RAS-MAPK signaling pathway and is associated with NS, NFNS, and NSML. Nonetheless, a thorough examination did not reveal any signs of these syndromes in the patient. Consequently, it was inferred that this patient likely falls within the spectrum of the RASopathies. This represents a unique case manifesting as orbital and lumbosacral plexiform neurofibromas carrying a <i>PTPN11</i> gene mutation, thereby broadening the phenotype spectrum of PTPN11 mutations. Our results also highlight the overlap between RASopathies. Neurofibromas should be considered indicative of a broader spectrum of disorders resulting from mutations in RASopathies other than NF1."

Due to the low prevalence, variability in the range, and severity of manifestations, as well as limited treatment options, these conditions require innovative trial designs to accelerate the development of new treatments. Within European Patient-Centric Clinical Trial Platforms (EU-PEARL), we designed 2 platform-basket trials in NF. The trials were designed by a team of multidisciplinary NF experts and trial methodology experts. The trial will consist of an observational and a treatment period. The observational period will serve as a longitudinal natural history study. The platform trial design and randomization to a sequence of available interventions allow for the addition of interventions during the trial. If a drug does not meet the predetermined efficacy endpoint or reveals unacceptable toxicities, participants may stop treatment on that arm and re-enter the observational period, where they can be re-randomized to a different treatment arm if eligible. Intervention-specific eligibility criteria and endpoints are listed in intervention-specific-appendices, allowing the flexibility and adaptability needed for highly variable and rare conditions like NF. These innovative platform-basket trials for NF may serve as a model for other rare diseases, as they will enhance the chance of identifying beneficial treatments through optimal learning from a small number of patients. The goal of these trials is to identify beneficial treatments for NF more rapidly and at a lower cost than traditional, single-agent clinical trials."

A review of the mandible in the patient's MRIs disclosed lesions with clear differences in progression rates.

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant neurocutaneous disorder caused by loss-of-function variants in the <i>NF1</i> gene. As of 20 November 2023, over 5000 distinct pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants have been reported in public databases. However, only a few <i>NF1</i> genotype-phenotype correlations have been established so far. In this study, we present findings on 40 individuals with NF1, comprising 26 unrelated probands and 14 affected relatives, who carry one of nine <i>NF1</i> heterozygous pathogenic splicing variants, all of which result in the in-frame skipping of exon 24 [19a] (NM_000267.3:r.3114_3197del, p.Asn1039_Arg1066del). These variants include c.3114-2A>G, c.3114-1G>A, c.3196A>G, c.3197G>A, c.3197G>T, c.3197+1G>A, c.3197+1G>T, c.3197+2T>C, and c.3197+3A>T. Among individuals with these variants, none exhibit externally visible plexiform neurofibromas, histopathologically confirmed cutaneous or subcutaneous neurofibromas, symptomatic spinal neurofibromas, or symptomatic optic pathway gliomas. The most prevalent, and sometimes sole, clinical feature observed in this cohort is multiple café-au-lait macules, with or without skinfold freckles: 85% and 60.5% of the individuals display six or more café-au-lait macules and freckles, respectively. In comparison to established NF1 genotype-phenotype correlations, these patients demonstrate highly similar clinical presentations to those associated with the <i>NF1</i> pathogenic variant c.2970_2972del (p.Met992del), known for resulting in the mildest clinical features. Despite the generally mild phenotype, cognitive impairment, developmental delay, and/or learning difficulties are still observed in 33.3% of these patients, suggesting that learning challenges remain a prominent aspect of the phenotypic presentation in these individuals and necessitate specialized care. This newly established genotype-phenotype correlation will assist clinicians in improving the management of patients harboring <i>NF1</i> exon 24 [19a] skipping variants and provide a new therapeutic target for NF1 treatment."

It represents a tumor predisposition syndrome characterized by a wide range of clinical manifestations, such as benign tumors, which primarily affect the skin and the nervous system. The most frequent clinical signs of NF 1 include café-au-lait spots all over the surface of the skin and axillary freckling; however, these signs can be accompanied by more severe manifestations such as the growth of both benign and malignant nervous system tumors and skeletal dysplasia, as well as a wide range of ocular manifestations. We report the rare case of retinal microvascular alterations and choroidal nodules in a 15 year old male patient with NF 1, detectable on optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA). The hyperreflective choroidal nodules modified the profile of the choroidal vasculature. The retinal microvascular alterations in the form of clustered capillaries were detected in the superficial capillary plexus located nasally to the macular region. Retinal vascular abnormalities undetectable on fundus photography or fundoscopy can be present in patients with NF 1. Indirect ophthalmoscopy of our study patient was unremarkable. However, retinal vascular abnormalities were seen on OCTA scans in the superficial capillary plexus and choroidal nodules were detected on raster OCT scans. OCTA represents a useful imaging technique for detecting retinal microvascular abnormalities, which can be considered additional distinctive signs of NF 1."

    "abstract": "Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumors (MPNSTs) are aggressive sarcomas that can arise both sporadically and in patients with the genetic syndrome Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Prognosis is dismal, as large dimensions, risk of relapse, and anatomical localization make surgery poorly effective, and no therapy is known. Hence, the identification of MPNST molecular features that could be hit in an efficient and selective way is mandatory to envision treatment options. Here, we find that MPNSTs express high levels of the glycolytic enzyme Hexokinase 2 (HK2), which is known to shield cancer cells from noxious stimuli when it localizes at MAMs (mitochondria-associated membranes), contact sites between mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum. A HK2-targeting peptide that dislodges HK2 from MAMs rapidly induces a massive death of MPNST cells. After identifying different matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) expressed in the MPNST microenvironment, we have designed HK2-targeting peptide variants that harbor cleavage sites for these MMPs, making such peptides activatable in the proximity of cancer cells. We find that the peptide carrying the MMP2/9 cleavage site is the most effective, both in inhibiting the in vitro tumorigenicity of MPNST cells and in hampering their growth in mice. Our data indicate that detaching HK2 from MAMs could pave the way for a novel anti-MPNST therapeutic strategy, which could be flexibly adapted to the protease expression features of the tumor microenvironment."

    "abstract": "Optic pathway glioma (OPG) is a feared complication to neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) since it can cause visual impairment in young children. The main goal of screening is to detect symptomatic OPGs that require treatment. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) has been suggested as a tool for detection of neuro-retinal damage. To investigate whether the ganglion cell layer assessed by OCT is a reliable measure to identify and detect relapses of symptomatic OPGs in children with NF1. Children (3-6 years) with NF1, with and without known OPG and children with sporadic OPG (S-OPG) resident in the Stockholm area, were invited and followed in a prospective study during a three-year period. Brain magnetic resonance tomography (MRI) had been performed in children with symptoms of OPG. Outcome measures were VA in logMAR, visual field index (VFI), average thicknesses of the ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (GC-IPL), and peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL). There were 25 children with MRI-verified OPG and 52 with NF1 without symptomatic OPG. Eyes from NF1 patients without symptoms of OPG showed significantly better results in all four analyzed parameters compared to eyes with NF1-associated OPG. Mean GC-IPL measurements seemed stable and reliable, significantly correlated to pRNFL (correlation coefficient (r) = 0.662, confidence interval (CI) = .507 to .773 p<0.001), VA (r = -0.661, CI = -7.45 to -.551, p<0.001) and VFI (r = 0.644, CI = .452 to .774, p<0.001). GC-IPL measurements were easy to obtain and acquired at considerably younger age than pRNFL (5.6±1.5 vs 6.8±1.3; p<0.001). The mean GC-IPL thickness could distinguish well between eyes with OPG and eyes without symptomatic OPG in children with NF1. As thinning of GC-IPL assessed with OCT could indicate underlying OPG, it should be included in the screening protocol of children with questionable VA measurements and in particular in children with NF1."

    "abstract": "The neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) RASopathy is associated with persistent fibrotic nonunions (pseudarthrosis) in human and mouse skeletal tissue. Here, we performed spatial transcriptomics to define the molecular signatures occurring during normal endochondral healing following fracture in mice. Within the control fracture callus, we observed spatially restricted activation of morphogenetic pathways, such as TGF-β, WNT, and BMP. To investigate the molecular mechanisms contributing to Nf1-deficient delayed fracture healing, we performed spatial transcriptomic analysis on a Postn-cre;Nf1fl/- (Nf1Postn) fracture callus. Transcriptional analyses, subsequently confirmed through phospho-SMAD1/5/8 immunohistochemistry, demonstrated a lack of BMP pathway induction in Nf1Postn mice. To gain further insight into the human condition, we performed spatial transcriptomic analysis of fracture pseudarthrosis tissue from a patient with NF1. Analyses detected increased MAPK signaling at the fibrocartilaginous-osseus junction. Similar to that in the Nf1Postn fracture, BMP pathway activation was absent within the pseudarthrosis tissue. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of delineating the molecular and tissue-specific heterogeneity inherent in complex regenerative processes, such as fracture healing, and reconstructing phase transitions representing endochondral bone formation in vivo. Furthermore, our results provide in situ molecular evidence of impaired BMP signaling underlying NF1 pseudarthrosis, potentially informing the clinical relevance of off-label BMP2 as a therapeutic intervention."

    "abstract": "Malignant peripheral sheath tumor (MPNST) is a rare, aggressive form of soft-tissue sarcoma that presents a unique set of diagnostic and treatment challenges and is associated with major unmet treatment medical needs. The chief aim of this review is to consider the epidemiology, histology, anatomic distribution, pathologic signaling pathways, diagnosis, and management of MPNST, with a focus on potential targeted therapies. A subordinate objective was to establish benchmarks for the antitumor activity of such treatments. MPNST has an incidence of 1:100,000 in the general population and 1:3500 among patients with the inherited condition of neurofibromatosis-1. Spindle-cell sarcomas of neural-crest origin, MPNSTs are frequently situated in the extremities and pelvis/trunk, often at the confluence of large nerve roots and bundles. Highly copy-number aberrant and enriched in chromosome 8, MPNSTs have a complex molecular pathogenesis that likely involves the interplay of multiple signaling pathways, including Ras/AKT/mTOR/MAPK, EGFR, p53, PTEN, and PRC2, as well as factors in the tumor microenvironment. A combination of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography with <sup>18</sup>F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-PET) enables comprehensive assessment of both morphology and metabolism, while MRI- and ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy can confirm histopathology. Although surgery with wide excisional margins is now the chief curative approach to localized disease, MPNST-specific survival has not improved in decades. For advanced and metastatic MPNST, radiation and chemotherapy (chiefly with anthracyclines plus ifosfamide) have somewhat promising but still largely uncertain treatment roles, chiefly in local control, downstaging, and palliation. No single druggable target has emerged, no objective responses have been observed with a number of targeted therapies (cumulative disease control rate in our review = 22.9-34.8%), and combinatorial approaches directed toward multiple signal transduction mechanisms are hallmarks of ongoing clinical trials. Despite advances in our understanding of the genetics and molecular biology of MPNST, further research is warranted to: (1) unravel the complex pathogenesis of this condition; (2) improve diagnostic yield; (3) delineate the appropriate roles of chemotherapy and radiation; and (4) develop a targeted therapy (or combination of such treatments) that is well tolerated and prolongs survival."

This is a retrospective multicenter cohort study of patients with MPNST from 11 secondary or tertiary centers in The Netherlands, Italy and the United States of America. All patients diagnosed with primary MPNST who underwent macroscopically complete surgical resection from 2000 to 2019 were included in this study. A multivariable Cox proportional hazard model for OS was estimated with prespecified predictors (age, grade, size, NF-1 status, triton status, depth, tumor location, and surgical margin). Model performance was assessed for the Sarculator and PERSARC calculators by examining discrimination (C-index) and calibration (calibration plots and observed-expected statistic; O/E-statistic). Internal-external cross-validation by different regions was performed to evaluate the generalizability of the model. A total of 507 patients with primary MPNSTs were included from 11 centers in 7 regions. During follow-up (median 8.7 years), 211 patients died. The C-index was 0.60 (95% CI 0.53-0.67) for both Sarculator and PERSARC. The MPNST-specific model had a pooled C-index of 0.69 (95%CI 0.65-0.73) at validation, with adequate discrimination and calibration across regions. The MPNST-specific MONACO model can be used to predict 3-, 5-, and 10-year OS in patients with primary MPNST who underwent macroscopically complete surgical resection. Further validation may refine the model to inform patients and physicians on prognosis and support them in shared decision-making."

    "title": "Multimodal Imaging Characteristics and Diagnostic Value of Choroidal Nodules in Patients with Neurofibromatosis Type 1.",
    "abstract": "Yasunari nodules are choroidal lesions observed in patients diagnosed with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1) and characterized by relatively irregular dome-shaped, plaque-like, or patchy boundaries. The present study examines the multimodal imaging characteristics of Yasunari nodules and their value in the diagnosis of NF-1. Medical records including optical coherence tomography (OCT), enhanced depth imaging OCT, infrared reflectance (IR) imaging, OCT angiography, and color fundus images of NF-1 patients who were examined at the Department of Ophthalmology in Dokuz Eylül University Faculty of Medicine between January 2022 and December 2023 were retrospectively reviewed for the presence of Yasunari nodules. A total of 54 eyes of 27 patients were included in the study. At least one choroidal nodule was detected on IR imaging in 52 eyes (96.3%). In 31 (72.1%) of the 43 eyes (79.6%) with available high-quality OCT angiography images, choroidal nodules were observed as areas showing a flow deficit in the choriocapillaris layer. Of the total 54 eyes included, Lisch nodules without choroidal nodules were observed in 2 eyes (3.7%). In 16 eyes (29.6%), Lisch nodules were not detected despite the presence of choroidal nodules. Both Lisch nodules and choroidal nodules were detected in the other 36 eyes (66.7%). Yasunari nodules are frequently observed in NF-1 cases and can be easily detected with multimodal imaging techniques, especially IR imaging. The ability to visualize choroidal nodules before the appearance of Lisch nodules demonstrates the importance of Yasunari nodules in the diagnosis of NF-1."

    "abstract": "Jaffe-Campanacci syndrome is a rare syndrome, characterized by multiple non-ossifying fibromas (NOF) and cafe-au-lait patches. The name was coined in 1982 by Mirra after Jaffe who first described the case in 1958. Although it's suggested there is a relation with Neurofibromatosis type 1, there is still no consensus on whether Jaffe-Campanacci syndrome is a subtype or variant of neurofibromatosis-1(NF-1). In this article, we present a case series of 2 patients. The first case is a 13-year-old male with Jaffe-Campanacci syndrome who presented with a distal femur fracture. His father had positive features of both Jaffe-Campanacci syndrome and NF-1, while his sister only had features of NF-1, so we presented both. Jaffe-Campanacci has a clear relationship with type 1 neurofibromatosis, which still has to be genetically established. Due to the presence of several large non-ossifying fibromas of the long bones, it is linked to a significant risk of pathological fractures. We concur with previous authors, that an osseous screening program should be performed for all patients with newly diagnosed type 1 neurofibromatosis, to identify non-ossifying fibromas and assess the potential for pathological fracture. Moreover, siblings of patients with NF-1 should be screened for multiple NOFs that may carry a high risk of pathological fractures."

    "abstract": "The purpose of this narrative review is to summarize pain symptomatology and mechanisms in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), discuss the pain related quality of life impacts of NF1, and discuss the literature exploring interventions to improve quality of life. Chronic pain in NF1 is described as headache and non-headache pain. The literature describes mechanisms contributing to neuronal hyperexcitability in the setting of reduced neurofibromin as key contributors to pain in NF1. Pain in NF1 negatively impacts quality of life with pain interference, depression, anxiety, and cognitive functioning acting as important mediators. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK) inhibitors are pharmacologic agents that interfere with pain mechanisms. Mind-body interventions improve coping skills to improve quality of life. Chronic pain in NF1 is heterogeneous with negative impacts on quality of life. New developments in pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions offer promising approaches to pain management and quality of life improvement. Additional research is necessary to validate the use of MEK inhibitors and mind-body interventions in the treatment of NF1."

As many as 70% of children with NF1 report difficulties with spatial/working memory, attention, executive function, and fine motor movements. In contrast to the utilization of various Nf1 mouse models, here we employ an NF1<sup>+/ex42del</sup> miniswine model to evaluate the mechanisms and characteristics of these presentations, taking advantage of a large animal species more like human anatomy and physiology. The prefrontal lobe, anterior cingulate, and hippocampus from NF1<sup>+/ex42del</sup> and wild-type miniswine were examined longitudinally, revealing abnormalities in mature oligodendrocytes and astrocytes, and microglial activation over time. Imbalances in GABA: Glutamate ratios and GAD67 expression were observed in the hippocampus and motor cortex, supporting the role of disruption in inhibitory neurotransmission in NF1 cognitive impairment and motor dysfunction. Moreover, NF1<sup>+/ex42del</sup> miniswine demonstrated slower and shorter steps, indicative of a balance-preserving response commonly observed in NF1 patients, and progressive memory and learning impairments. Collectively, our findings affirm the effectiveness of NF1<sup>+/ex42del</sup> miniswine as a valuable resource for assessing cognitive and motor impairments associated with NF1, investigating the involvement of specific neural circuits and glia in these processes, and evaluating potential therapeutic interventions."

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a neurocutaneous disorder. Plexiform neurofibromas (PNFs) are benign tumors commonly formed in patients with NF1. PNFs have a high incidence of developing into malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) with a 5-year survival rate of only 30%. Therefore, the accurate diagnosis and differentiation of MPNSTs from benign PNFs are critical to patient management. We studied a fluorine-18 labeled tryptophan positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer, 1-(2-[<sup>18</sup>F]fluoroethyl)-L-tryptophan (L-[<sup>18</sup>F]FETrp), to detect NF1-associated tumors in an animal model. An ex vivo biodistribution study of L-[<sup>18</sup>F]FETrp showed a similar tracer distribution and kinetics between the wild-type and triple mutant mice with the highest uptake in the pancreas. Bone uptake was stable. Brain uptake was low during the 90-min uptake period. Static PET imaging at 60 min post-injection showed L-[<sup>18</sup>F]FETrp had a comparable tumor uptake with [<sup>1</sup>⁸F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). However, L-[<sup>18</sup>F]FETrp showed a significantly higher tumor-to-brain ratio than FDG (<i>n</i> = 4, <i>p</i> < 0.05). Sixty-minute-long dynamic PET scans using the two radiotracers showed similar kidney, liver, and lung kinetics. A dysregulated tryptophan metabolism in NF1 mice was further confirmed using immunohistostaining. L-[<sup>18</sup>F]FETrp is warranted to further investigate differentiating malignant NF1 tumors from benign PNFs. The study may reveal the tryptophan-kynurenine pathway as a therapeutic target for treating NF1."

    "title": "Therapeutic Nonsense Suppression Modalities: From Small Molecules to Nucleic Acid-Based Approaches.",
    "abstract": "Nonsense mutations are genetic mutations that create premature termination codons (PTCs), leading to truncated, defective proteins in diseases such as cystic fibrosis, neurofibromatosis type 1, Dravet syndrome, Hurler syndrome, Beta thalassemia, inherited bone marrow failure syndromes, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and even cancer. These mutations can also trigger a cellular surveillance mechanism known as nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) that degrades the PTC-containing mRNA. The activation of NMD can attenuate the consequences of truncated, defective, and potentially toxic proteins in the cell. Since approximately 20% of all single-point mutations are disease-causing nonsense mutations, it is not surprising that this field has received significant attention, resulting in a remarkable advancement in recent years. In fact, since our last review on this topic, new examples of nonsense suppression approaches have been reported, namely new ways of promoting the translational readthrough of PTCs or inhibiting the NMD pathway. With this review, we update the state-of-the-art technologies in nonsense suppression, focusing on novel modalities with therapeutic potential, such as small molecules (readthrough agents, NMD inhibitors, and molecular glue degraders); antisense oligonucleotides; tRNA suppressors; ADAR-mediated RNA editing; targeted pseudouridylation; and gene/base editing. While these various modalities have significantly advanced in their development stage since our last review, each has advantages (e.g., ease of delivery and specificity) and disadvantages (manufacturing complexity and off-target effect potential), which we discuss here."

    "abstract": "Congenital pseudarthrosis of the forearm bones (CPFBs) is rare, with only 106 reported cases, and is frequently associated with neurofibromatosis (NF). Approximately 5% of patients with NF develop pseudarthrosis, and 50% of patients with pseudarthrosis have NF. Achieving bone union is difficult in congenital pseudarthrosis. Many methods have been attempted, including casting, internal fixation with or without grafting, and electrical stimulation, but failure is frequent. Free vascularized fibular flaps (FVFs) have been used to bridge long bone defects since 1975 and in tibial pseudarthrosis since 1979. In CPFB, FVF is more successful than other methods in achieving union and is the current treatment of choice. Here, we presented three cases of forearm pseudarthrosis treated with FVF, reviewed the literature on CPFB, and discussed some technical aspects of FVF treatment. Three cases of congenital pseudoarthrosis were treated with free fibula flaps, diagnosed at ages of 7 years (ulna), 15 months (radius), and 9 years (radius and ulna). Two flaps were stabilized with intramedullary wires and latterly, one with compression plates. One persistent nonunion received revision nonvascularized bone grafting and plating. All patients achieved union by 11 months after index surgery. Reconstruction with vascularized fibula is the treatment of choice because it offers the highest published union rates and good functional results. Complete resection of the affected bone and stable fixation, latterly with compression plates are critical to success. Surgery is technically demanding, and complications are common. Secondary surgery may be required, but outcomes are favorable. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: IV."

    "abstract": "Congenital pseudarthrosis of the tibia (CPT) is a severe pathology marked by spontaneous bone fractures that fail to heal, leading to fibrous nonunion. Half of patients with CPT are affected by the multisystemic genetic disorder neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) caused by mutations in the <i>NF1</i> tumor suppressor gene, a negative regulator of RAS-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. Here, we analyzed patients with CPT and <i>Prss56-Nf1</i> knockout mice to elucidate the pathogenic mechanisms of CPT-related fibrous nonunion and explored a pharmacological approach to treat CPT. We identified <i>NF1</i>-deficient Schwann cells and skeletal stem/progenitor cells (SSPCs) in pathological periosteum as affected cell types driving fibrosis. Whereas <i>NF1</i>-deficient SSPCs adopted a fibrotic fate, <i>NF1</i>-deficient Schwann cells produced critical paracrine factors including transforming growth factor-β and induced fibrotic differentiation of wild-type SSPCs. To counteract the elevated RAS-MAPK signaling in both <i>NF1</i>-deficient Schwann cells and SSPCs, we used MAPK kinase (MEK) and Src homology 2 containing protein tyrosine phosphatase 2 (SHP2) inhibitors. Combined MEK-SHP2 inhibition in vivo prevented fibrous nonunion in the <i>Prss56-Nf1</i> knockout mouse model, providing a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of fibrous nonunion in CPT."

However, data on the utility of existing surveys in capturing neurofibromatosis 1 skin treatment outcomes are lacking. This quantitative study examined the relationship between clinician-rated severity and visibility and patient-rated itch and quality-of-life (QoL) to (1) establish baseline levels of skin- and condition-specific-related QoL, itch, depression and anxiety; (2) identify patient concerns to inform the development and evaluation of skin interventions; and (3) compare the sensitivity of different QoL measures. Validated scales included Skindex-29, Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), Neurofibromatosis 1-adult quality-of-life (NF1-AdQOL) questionnaire, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). We recruited 100 participants (response rate: 95%). Of these, 42% reported itch and 23% had probable clinical anxiety. Our cohort had higher levels of anxiety and total HADS scores compared to a control population. Using multivariate regression analysis, increasing visibility significantly predicted poorer QoL using the Skindex-29, NF1-AdQOL, and DLQI (p < 0.05); and itch significantly predicted worse QoL in Skindex-29 and NF1-AdQOL (p < 0.05). The highest mean scoring questions in Skindex-29 and NF1-AdQOL concerned worry about worsening skin disease and embarrassment. The highest mean scoring questions in DLQI were regarding itch, pain, and embarrassment. Items asking specifically about cutaneous neurofibromas (cNF) scored higher than comparable skin-specific questions (t-test p value <0.05). In summary, this study provides insights into the factors contributing to impaired QoL, anxiety, and mood in NF1 patients with cutaneous neurofibromas. Key factors identified for use in cNF measures include visibility, itch, anxiety, embarrassment, fears of worsening skin disease, and cNF-specific questions."

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a complex genetic disorder that affects a range of tissues including muscle and bone. Recent preclinical and clinical studies have shown that Nf1 deficiency in muscle causes metabolic changes resulting in intramyocellular lipid accumulation and muscle weakness. These can be subsequently rescued by dietary interventions aimed at modulating lipid availability and metabolism. It was speculated that the modified diet may rescue defects in cortical bone as NF1 deficiency has been reported to affect genes involved with lipid metabolism. Bone specimens were analyzed from wild type control mice as well as Nf1Prx1-/- (limb-targeted Nf1 knockout mice) fed standard chow versus a range of modified chows hypothesized to influence lipid metabolism. Mice were fed from 4 weeks to 12 weeks of age. MicroCT analysis was performed on the cortical bone to examine standard parameters (bone volume, tissue mineral density, cortical thickness) and specific porosity measures (closed pores corresponding to osteocyte lacunae, and larger open pores). Nf1Prx1-/- bones were found to have inferior bone properties to wild type bones, with a 4-fold increase in the porosity attributed to open pores. These measures were rescued by dietary interventions including a L-carnitine + medium-chain fatty acid supplemented chow previously shown to improve muscle histology function. Histological staining visualized these changes in bone porosity. These data support the concept that lipid metabolism may have a mechanistic impact on bone porosity and quality in NF1."

Here, we describe a case of endovascular treatment of a ruptured occipital artery aneurysm that occurred after a craniotomy in a patient with NF1. A 46-year-old man with a history of NF1 underwent a right lateral suboccipital craniotomy to remove a cavernous hemangioma in the right middle cerebellar peduncle. Severe bleeding occurred in the occipital artery during the craniotomy. Due to vessel fragility, coagulation and ligation were not possible, and pressure hemostasis was achieved using cellulose oxide and fibrin glue. On postoperative day 12, the patient developed a sudden swelling on the right side of the neck as well as tracheal compression. Contrast-enhanced CT revealed a ruptured aneurysm in the right occipital artery. Transarterial embolization was performed under general anesthesia the same day. Right external carotid angiography showed an 18-mm-diameter fusiform aneurysm in the occipital artery. The aneurysm ruptured inferiorly to form a large pseudoaneurysm with significant jet flow. An arteriovenous fistula was also observed in a nearby vein. A microcatheter was inserted into the fusiform aneurysm under proximal blood flow control, and embolization was performed using coils and <i>N</i>-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate. Compared to surgical repair of ruptured occipital artery aneurysms, endovascular treatment appears to be safe, effective, minimally invasive, and rapid. Ruptured occipital artery aneurysms in NF1 patients can cause neck swelling and airway compression and should be recognized as a potentially lethal condition."

The Program for the Education and Enrichment of Relational Skills (PEERS®), a widely established social skills intervention in autism spectrum disorders with expansion to other conditions, was recently modified to be offered virtually. This study examined the feasibility and acceptability of this telehealth intervention. 27 adolescents with NF1 with social skills difficulties and at least 1 caregiver enrolled in the study. 19 of those participants (Mage = 14.21 years, SD = 1.63; 7 females; 79% White) completed PEERS® via telehealth in a single-arm pilot study. Dropout rates, attendance records, helpfulness of the curriculum topics and caregiver-reported acceptability, including ratings on the Treatment Acceptability Questionnaire, were examined. Low study drop out (30% of enrolled participants; 14% of participants who began the intervention) and high attendance rates were observed. Caregivers found sessions related to common, everyday interactions most helpful. Adolescents indicated sessions related to having get-togethers and social nuances (e.g., humor) as most helpful. Caregiver ratings indicated acceptability of the intervention. This investigation supported the feasibility and acceptability of telehealth PEERS®, a social skills intervention program, among adolescents with NF1 and their caregivers based on attendance patterns as well as appraisal of the curriculum and telehealth modality."

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) is caused by loss of function variants in the NF1 gene. Most patients with NF1 develop skin lesions called cutaneous neurofibromas (cNFs). Currently the only approved therapeutic for NF1 is selumetinib, a mitogen -activated protein kinase (MEK) inhibitor. The purpose of this study was to analyze the transcriptome of cNF tumors before and on selumetinib treatment to understand both tumor composition and response. We obtained biopsy sets of tumors both pre- and on- selumetinib treatment from the same individuals and were able to collect sets from four separate individuals. We sequenced mRNA from 5844 nuclei and identified 30,442 genes in the untreated group and sequenced 5701 nuclei and identified 30,127 genes in the selumetinib treated group. We identified and quantified distinct populations of cells (Schwann cells, fibroblasts, pericytes, myeloid cells, melanocytes, keratinocytes, and two populations of endothelial cells). While we anticipated that cell proportions might change with treatment, we did not identify any one cell population that changed significantly, likely due to an inherent level of variability between tumors. We also evaluated differential gene expression based on drug treatment in each cell type. Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) was also used to identify pathways that differ on treatment. As anticipated, we identified a significant decrease in ERK/MAPK signaling in cells including Schwann cells but most specifically in myeloid cells. Interestingly, there is a significant decrease in opioid signaling in myeloid and endothelial cells; this downward trend is also observed in Schwann cells and fibroblasts. Cell communication was assessed by RNA velocity, Scriabin, and CellChat analyses which indicated that Schwann cells and fibroblasts have dramatically altered cell states defined by specific gene expression signatures following treatment (RNA velocity). There are dramatic changes in receptor-ligand pairs following treatment (Scriabin), and robust intercellular signaling between virtually all cell types associated with extracellular matrix (ECM) pathways (Collagen, Laminin, Fibronectin, and Nectin) is downregulated after treatment. These response specific gene signatures and interaction pathways could provide clues for understanding treatment outcomes or inform future therapies."

We (i) compared attentional profiles between NF1 children with and without ADHD and children with primary ADHD criteria and (ii) investigated the possible relationship between attentional disorders and \"unidentified bright objects\" (UBOs) in NF1. This retrospective study included 47 NF1 children, 25 with ADHD criteria (NF1+adhd group), matched for age, sex, and cognitive level with 47 children with primary ADHD (ADHD group). We collected computer task (sustained-attention, visuomotor-decision, inhibition, and cognitive-flexibility tasks) scores normalized for age and sex, and brain magnetic resonance imaging data. (i) Working memory was impaired in all groups. (ii) Omissions (p < 0.002) and response-time variability (p < 0.05) in sustained-attention and visuomotor-decision tasks and errors (p < 0.02) in the cognitive-flexibility task were lower for the NFI+adhd and ADHD groups than for the NF1-no-adhd group. (iii) The NF1+adhd group had slower response times (p ≤ 0.02) for inhibition and visuomotor-decision tasks than the other groups. (iv) We found no relevant association between cognitive performance and UBOs. NF1 children with ADHD have an attentional and executive functions deficit profile similar to that of children with primary ADHD, but with a slower response-time, increasing learning difficulties. The atypical connectivity of fronto-striatal pathways, poorer dopamine homeostasis, and increased GABA inhibition observed in NF1 renders vulnerable the development of the widely distributed neural networks that support attentional, working-memory, and executive functions."

In the past two decades, tissue-specific Nf1 knockout mouse models were developed using commercially available tissue-specific Cre recombinase and the Nf1 flox mice to mimic neurofibroma development. However, these models develop para-spinal neurofibroma, recapitulating a rare type of neurofibroma found in NF1 patients. The NPcis mouse model developed a malignant version of neurofibroma called malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) within 3 to 6 months but intriguingly without apparent benign precursor lesion. Here, we revisited the NPcis model and discovered that about 20% display clinical signs similar to Nf1 tissue-specific knockout mice models. However, a systematic histological analysis could not explain the clinical signs we observed although we noticed lesions reminiscent of a neurofibroma in a peripheral nerve, a cutaneous neurofibroma, and para-spinal neurofibroma on rare occasions in NPcis mice. We also observed that 10% of the mice developed a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) spontaneously, coinciding with their earring tag identification. Strikingly, half of the sciatic nerves from NPcis mice developed plexiform neurofibroma within 1-6 months when intentionally injured. Thus, we provided a procedure to turn the widely used NPcis sarcoma model into a model recapitulating plexiform neurofibroma."

To investigate oncolytic Herpes Simplex Virus (oHSV) as an immunotherapeutic approach, we compared viral replication, functional activity, and immune response between unarmed and interleukin 12 (IL-12)-armed oncolytic viruses in virus-permissive (B109) and -resistant (67C-4) murine MPNSTs. This study compared two attenuated IL-12-oHSVs with γ134.5 gene deletions (Δγ134.5) and the same transgene expression cassette. The primary difference in the IL-12-oHSVs was in their ability to counter the translational arrest response in infected cells. Unlike M002 (Δγ134.5, mIL-12), C002 (Δγ134.5, mIL-12, IRS1) expresses an HCMV IRS1 gene and evades dsRNA activated translational arrest in infected cells. Our results show that oHSV replication and gene expression results in vitro were not predictive of oHSV direct oncolytic activity in vivo. Tumors that supported viral replication in cell culture studies resisted viral replication by both oHSVs and restricted M002 transgene expression in vivo. Furthermore, two IL-12-oHSVs with equivalent transcriptional activity differed in IL-12 protein production in vivo, and the differences in IL-12 protein levels were reflected in immune infiltrate activity changes as well as tumor growth suppression differences between the IL-12-oHSVs. C002-treated tumors exhibited sustained IL-12 production with improved dendritic cells, monocyte-macrophage activity (MHCII, CD80/CD86 upregulation) and a polyfunctional Th1-cell response in the tumor infiltrates. These results suggest that transgene protein production differences between oHSVs in vivo, in addition to replication differences, can impact OV-therapeutic activity."

Other inherited syndromes associated with PanNETs include MEN4, von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome, neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), and tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). These syndromes are highly penetrant and their clinical manifestations may vary even among members of the same family. They are attributed to genetic mutations involving key molecular pathways regulating cell growth, differentiation, and angiogenesis. Pancreatic NETs in hereditary syndromes are often multiple, develop at a younger age compared to sporadic tumors, and are associated with endocrine and nonendocrine tumors derived from multiple organs. Lung NETs are not as common as PanNETs and are mostly encountered in MEN1 syndrome and include typical and atypical lung carcinoids. Early detection of PanNETs and LNETs related to inherited syndromes is crucial, and specific follow-up protocols need to be employed to optimize diagnosis and management. Genetic screening is recommended in childhood, and diagnostic screening starts often in adolescence, even in asymptomatic mutation carriers. Optimal management and therapeutic decisions should be made in the context of a multidisciplinary team in specialized centers, whereas specific biomarkers aiming to identify patients denoted to follow a more aggressive course need to be developed."

    "abstract": "Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are aggressive soft-tissue tumors prevalent in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) patients, posing a significant risk of metastasis and recurrence. Current magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) imaging lacks decisiveness in distinguishing benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors (BPNSTs) and MPNSTs, necessitating invasive biopsies. This study aims to develop a radiomics model using quantitative imaging features and machine learning to distinguish MPNSTs from BPNSTs. Clinical data and MRIs from MPNST and BPNST patients (2000-2019) were collected at a tertiary sarcoma referral center. Lesions were manually and semi-automatically segmented on MRI scans, and radiomics features were extracted using the Workflow for Optimal Radiomics Classification (WORC) algorithm, employing automated machine learning. The evaluation was conducted using a 100× random-split cross-validation. A total of 35 MPNSTs and 74 BPNSTs were included. The T1-weighted (T1w) MRI radiomics model outperformed others with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.71. The incorporation of additional MRI scans did not enhance performance. Combining T1w MRI with clinical features achieved an AUC of 0.74. Experienced radiologists achieved AUCs of 0.75 and 0.66, respectively. Radiomics based on T1w MRI scans and clinical features show some ability to distinguish MPNSTs from BPNSTs, potentially aiding in the management of these tumors."

    "abstract": "Congenital pseudarthrosis of the forearm poses a considerable challenge because of its rarity. The objective of this report is to introduce a novel surgical technique for its treatment. Here, we document a case of congenital pseudarthrosis of the radius in a 3-year-old boy diagnosed with type-1 neurofibromatosis. The surgical treatment involved the excision of approximately 9 cm of native radial periosteum and a bifocal radius osteotomy, which was supplemented with a vascularized tibial periosteal transplant to facilitate bone healing. Anastomosis between the anterior tibial vessels and radial vessels was performed. No immediate or late postoperative complications were observed. After 3 weeks, a robust callus formation was observed, and during a follow-up examination 3 years and 4 months later, a wide range of active forearm rotation was noted. This report suggests that vascularized periosteal flaps show promise as a viable treatment option for congenital pseudarthrosis of the forearm. They offer an alternative to vascularized fibular grafts or single-bone forearm constructs."

These lesions, whether occurring spontaneously or as a result of trauma, have the potential to cause severe and even fatal hemorrhage. We presented a case demonstrating the most extensive hematoma ever documented in a patient with NF1, resulting from a minor trauma. He experienced hemodynamic instability due to severe anemia. Arteriography revealed a rupture in the intercostal artery, which was successfully treated through interventional embolization to stop the hemorrhage. Additionally, we implemented a refined surgical approach, beginning with suturing, followed by the meticulous resection of necrotic and aberrant tissues, thereby markedly diminishing bleeding. Minor trauma may cause severe bleeding in patients with NF1, which can be life-threatening. Timely diagnosis of NF1 and effective hemostatic techniques are key to successful treatment."

    "abstract": "Since the discovery of the association between BRAF mutations and fusions in the development of childhood low-grade gliomas and the subsequent recognition that most childhood low-grade glial and glioneuronal tumors have aberrant signaling through the RAS/RAF/MAP kinase pathway, there has been a dramatic change in how these tumors are conceptualized. Many of the fusions and mutations present in these tumors are associated with molecular targets, which have agents in development or already in clinical use. Various agents, including MEK inhibitors, BRAF inhibitors, MTOR inhibitors and, in small subsets of patients NTRK inhibitors, have been used successfully to treat children with recurrent disease, after failure of conventional approaches such as surgery or chemotherapy. The relative benefits of chemotherapy as compared to molecular-targeted therapy for children with newly diagnosed gliomas and neuroglial tumors are under study. Already the combination of an MEK inhibitor and a BRAF inhibitor has been shown superior to conventional chemotherapy (carboplatin and vincristine) in newly diagnosed children with BRAF-V600E mutated low-grade gliomas and neuroglial tumors. However, the long-term effects of such molecular-targeted treatment are unknown. The potential use of molecular-targeted therapy in early treatment has made it mandatory that the molecular make-up of the majority of low-grade glial and glioneuronal tumors is known before initiation of therapy. The primary exception to this rule is in children with neurofibromatosis type 1 who, by definition, have NF1 loss; however, even in this population, gliomas arising in late childhood and adolescence or those not responding to conventional treatment may be candidates for biopsy, especially before entry on molecular-targeted therapy trials."

Research in this model system has shed light on multiple aspects of brain physiology and behavior, from fundamental neuronal function to complex behaviors.

The MB integrates multimodal sensory information and is involved in behaviors ranging from sensory processing/responses to learning and memory. Many genes that underlie brain disorders are conserved, from flies to humans, and studies in <i>Drosophila</i> have contributed significantly to our understanding of the mechanisms of brain disorders. Genetic mutations that mimic human diseases-such as Fragile X syndrome, neurofibromatosis type 1, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease-affect MB structure and function, altering behavior. Studies dissecting the effects of disease-causing mutations in the MB have identified key pathological mechanisms, and the development of a complete connectome promises to add a comprehensive anatomical framework for disease modeling.

    "abstract": "NF1 microdeletion syndrome, accounting for 5-11% of NF1 patients, is caused by a deletion in the NF1 region and it is generally characterized by a severe phenotype. Although 70% of NF1 microdeletion patients presents the same 1.4 Mb type-I deletion, some patients may show additional clinical features. Therefore, the contribution of several pathogenic mechanisms, besides haploinsufficiency of some genes within the deletion interval, is expected and needs to be defined. We investigated an altered expression of deletion flanking genes by qPCR in patients with type-1 NF1 deletion, compared to healthy donors, possibly contributing to the clinical traits of NF1 microdeletion syndrome. In addition, the 1.4-Mb deletion leads to changes in the 3D chromatin structure in the 17q11.2 region. Specifically, this deletion alters DNA-DNA interactions in the regions flanking the breakpoints, as demonstrated by our 4C-seq analysis. This alteration likely causes position effect on the expression of deletion flanking genes.Interestingly, 4C-seq analysis revealed that in microdeletion patients, an interaction was established between the RHOT1 promoter and the SLC6A4 gene, which showed increased expression. We performed NGS on putative modifier genes, and identified two \"likely pathogenic\" rare variants in RAS pathway, possibly contributing to incidental phenotypic features.This study provides new insights into understanding the pathogenesis of NF1 microdeletion syndrome and suggests a novel pathomechanism that contributes to the expression phenotype in addition to haploinsufficiency of genes located within the deletion.This is a pivotal approach that can be applied to unravel microdeletion syndromes, improving precision medicine, prognosis and patients' follow-up."

They may be unique or multiple, encapsulated or not, subcutaneous or sometimes visceral. In some cases, they form large areas of non-encapsulated fat hypertrophy, with a variable degree of fibrosis. They can develop despite the absence of obesity. They may be familial or acquired. At difference with lipodystrophy syndromes, they are not associated with lipoatrophy areas, except in some rare cases such as type 2 familial partial lipodystrophy syndromes (FPLD2). Their metabolic impact is variable in part depending on associated obesity. They may have functional or aesthetic consequences. Lipomatosis may be isolated, be part of a syndrome, or may be visceral. Isolated lipomatoses include multiple symmetrical lipomatosis (Madelung disease or Launois-Bensaude syndrome), familial multiple lipomatosis, the painful Dercum's disease also called Adiposis Dolorosa or Ander syndrome, mesosomatic lipomatosis also called Roch-Leri lipomatosis, familial angiolipomatosis, lipedema and hibernomas.

The SPRINT study included 50 children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and plexiform neurofibroma (PN) that could not be removed with surgery. PNs are tumors that grow along nerves and can cause various problems for children, such as pain, changes to appearance, and muscle weakness. In SPRINT, the study team wanted to learn whether a medication called selumetinib was able to shrink the PN caused by NF1 (also known as NF1-related PN), and if shrinking PNs helped relieve children of the problems caused by it. To assess how selumetinib might help, children had scans to measure the size of their PN, completed questionnaires, and had a variety of other tests done by their doctor. Their caregivers also completed questionnaires about their child. The children took selumetinib capsules twice a day on an empty stomach. The results showed that selumetinib was able to shrink the PN for most children (68%). The results also showed that the problems caused by the children's PNs mostly improved while on selumetinib treatment. SPRINT also showed that the side effects of selumetinib were mainly mild and could be managed by doctors. Before SPRINT, there were not many treatment options for children with NF1 and PN as there were no medications that had been shown to shrink PN, and surgery was not always possible. SPRINT showed that this medication shrinks most PNs and could help children with NF1 and PN. In April 2020, selumetinib was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) because of the results of SPRINT. Selumetinib was the first and, as of February 2024, is the only medicine that can be prescribed by doctors to help children with NF1-related PN. <b>Clinical Trial Registration</b>: NCT01362803 (SPRINT) (ClinicalTrials.gov)."

The authors present the first case of a subperiosteal hematoma in the forehead. A 36-year-old man presented with a rapidly swelling firm, fixed, 8×10 cm forehead mass. It became evident shortly after a fine-needle aspiration biopsy. Computed tomography imaging 2 months after the biopsy showed a hematoma that was encapsulated by a surrounding layer of ossification. Magnetic resonance imaging displayed a fluid-fluid level under the ossified area. These characteristic images led us to diagnose this rare lesion as a subperiosteal hematoma with ossification. Rapid ossification is a characteristic imaging finding of subperiosteal hematoma, which makes definitive diagnosis easy. It becomes imperative to underscore the potential risks of fine-needle aspiration in proximity to the periosteum in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1."

More than 40% of cases of pheochromocytomas are associated with genetic conditions such as neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) or von Hippel-Lindau syndrome. Cystic pheochromocytomas are rare, generally asymptomatic, and thus of bigger size at the time of diagnosis. Surgical treatment is necessary to prevent cardiovascular morbidity and malignancy risk. We report the case of a 27-year-old patient admitted for further examination of a left adrenal mass that was discovered by an abdominal CT scan in the context of abdominal pain associated with hypertension evolving for three years. The clinical examination showed the presence of multiple café au lait spots, axillary and inguinal freckling with two dermal neurofibromas diagnosed clinically, as well as Lisch nodules on bilateral ophthalmic examination, thus meeting the clinical criteria for the diagnosis of NF1. The clinical laboratory investigation showed elevated urinary metanephrine and normetanephrine levels. CT scan examination showed a 10 cm left adrenal cystic mass on abdominal CT. This mass uptake of the radioligand in metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy without secondary extra-adrenal localization allowed the diagnosis of a seemingly benign cystic pheochromocytoma to be made. The patient was put on presurgical drug preparation with volume expansion and then underwent left unilateral adrenalectomy. The histopathological study was in favor of a rather aggressive cystic pheochromocytoma with a pheochromocytoma of the adrenal gland scaled (PASS) score of 9. Blood pressure and urine catecholamines at seven days, three months, six months, and one year after surgery were normalized. Cystic pheochromocytoma is a rare tumor with a potentially poor prognosis. It is characterized by a more insidious evolution and a larger volume at diagnosis. It should be considered a diagnosis in patients with a cystic adrenal mass or an extra-adrenal mass with fluctuating blood pressure during surgery. This case illustrates the importance of both presurgical preparation and screening for pheochromocytoma in neurofibromatosis type 1."

To our knowledge, this is the first time that this constellation of tumors has been described in the literature. A female patient in her late 20s with known NF1 was diagnosed with an inflammatory rhabdomyoblastic tumor, pheochromocytoma, and pulmonary hamartoma in a short succession. IRMT was found to harbor a near-haploid genome and displayed a typical immunohistochemical profile as well as a focal aberrant p53 expression pattern.

Mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy values of lateral lemniscus, inferior colliculus, corpus geniculatum mediale, Heschl gyrus, and brainstem were compared between groups. The correlation between mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy values of auditory pathways and age was investigated. <b>Results:</b> There was a significant difference between group 1 and group 2 in terms of mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy values at lateral lemniscus, inferior colliculus, corpus geniculatum mediale, and Heschl gyrus. Increased mean diffusivity and decreased fractional anisotropy values at brainstem were found in group 1. There was a significant difference between group 1 and group 3 in terms of mean diffusivity values at all auditory pathways. Fractional anisotropy values obtained from lateral lemniscus, inferior colliculus, and Heschl gyrus decreased in group 1 compared with group 3. There was a negative correlation between mean diffusivity values and positive correlation between fractional anisotropy values at lateral lemniscus, inferior colliculus, Heschl gyrus, and age. <b>Conclusions:</b> Our diffusion tensor imaging findings show that the neuronal integrity of the auditory pathways is affected in neurofibromatosis type 1 patients with brainstem focal areas of abnormal signal intensity. We think that the disappearance of brainstem focal areas of abnormal signal intensity associated with myelin repair and the regression of diffusion tensor imaging changes in the auditory pathways occur simultaneously with advancing age in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1."

    "abstract": "Optic pathway gliomas (OPGs) are most predominant pilocytic astrocytomas, which are typically diagnosed within the first decade of life. The majority of affected children with OPGs also present with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), the most common tumor predisposition syndrome. OPGs in individuals with NF1 primarily affect the optic pathway and lead to visual disturbance. However, it is challenging to assess risk in asymptomatic patients without valid biomarkers. On the other hand, for symptomatic patients, there is still no effective treatment to prevent or recover vision loss. Therefore, this review summarizes current knowledge regarding the pathogenesis of NF1-associated OPGs (NF1-OPGs) from preclinical studies to seek potential prognostic markers and therapeutic targets. First, the loss of the NF1 gene activates 3 distinct Ras effector pathways, including the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, the MEK/ERK pathway, and the cAMP pathway, which mediate glioma tumorigenesis. Meanwhile, non-neoplastic cells from the tumor microenvironment (microglia, T cells, neurons, etc.) also contribute to gliomagenesis via various soluble factors. Subsequently, we investigated potential genetic risk factors, molecularly targeted therapies, and neuroprotective strategies for tumor prevention and vision recovery. Last, potential directions and promising preclinical models of NF1-OPGs are presented for further research. On the whole, NF1-OPGs develop as a result of the interaction between glioma cells and the tumor microenvironment. Developing effective treatments require a better understanding of tumor molecular characteristics, as well as multistage interventions targeting both neoplastic cells and non-neoplastic cells."

Current surgical and nonsurgical approaches demonstrate persistent nonunion or refracture, often resulting in amputation. This report describes the management of 3 patients with anterolateral tibial bowing and NF1 who underwent distal tibia-guided growth. The patients had an average age of 1.6 years at initial operation, with a total of 3 to 4 surgeries over an average of 2.1 years. The latest follow-up on all patients is included, at a mean of 5.1 years after the initial operation. All 3 patients experienced substantial functional improvement and improved alignment of the mechanical axis of the tibia. One patient has experienced refracture. Our study indicates that guided growth can serve as an additional surgical option to improve ALTB and potentially reduce the risk of fracture and pseudarthrosis by restoring normal mechanical alignment.

    "title": "Identifying, Diagnosing, and Grading Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumors in Genetically Engineered Mouse Models.",
    "abstract": "Patients with the autosomal dominant tumor susceptibility syndrome neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) commonly develop plexiform neurofibromas (PNs) that subsequently transform into highly aggressive malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs). Understanding the process by which a PN transforms into an MPNST would be facilitated by the availability of genetically engineered mouse (GEM) models that accurately replicate the PN-MPNST progression seen in humans with NF1. Unfortunately, GEM models with Nf1 ablation do not fully recapitulate this process. This led us to develop P0-GGFβ3 mice, a GEM model in which overexpression of the Schwann cell mitogen neuregulin-1 (NRG1) in Schwann cells results in the development of PNs that progress to become MPNSTs with high frequency. However, to determine whether tumorigenesis and neoplastic progression in P0-GGFβ3 mice accurately model the processes seen in NF1 patients, we had to first prove that the pathology of P0-GGFβ3 peripheral nerve sheath tumors recapitulates the pathology of their human counterparts. Here, we describe the specialized methodologies used to accurately diagnose and grade peripheral nervous system neoplasms in GEM models, using P0-GGFβ3 and P0-GGFβ3;Trp53<sup>+/-</sup> mice as an example. We describe the histologic, immunohistochemical, and histochemical methods used to diagnose PNs and MPNSTs, how to distinguish these neoplasms from other tumor types that mimic their pathology, and how to grade these neoplasms. We discuss the establishment of early-passage cultures from GEM MPNSTs, how to characterize these cultures using immunocytochemistry, and how to verify their tumorigenicity by establishing allografts. Collectively, these techniques characterize the pathology of PNs and MPNSTs that arise in GEM models and critically compare the pathology of these murine tumors to their human counterparts."

    "abstract": "Maternal diet-induced obesity has been demonstrated to alter neurodevelopment in offspring, which may lead to reduced cognitive capacity, hyperactivity, and impairments in social behavior. Patients with the clinically heterogeneous genetic disorder Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) may present with similar deficits, but it is currently unclear whether environmental factors such as maternal diet influence the development of these phenotypes, and if so, the mechanism by which such an effect would occur. To enable evaluation of how maternal obesogenic diet exposure affects systemic factors relevant to neurodevelopment in NF1, we have developed a method to simultaneously collect non-hemolyzed serum and whole or regionally micro-dissected brains from fetal offspring of murine dams fed a control diet versus a high-fat, high-sucrose diet. Brains were processed for cryosectioning or flash frozen to use for subsequent RNA or protein isolation; the quality of the collected tissue was verified by immunostaining. The quality of the serum was verified by analyzing macronutrient profiles. Using this technique, we have identified that maternal obesogenic diet increases fetal serum cholesterol similarly between WT and Nf1-heterozygous pups."

    "abstract": "Encephalocraniocutaneous lipomatosis (ECCL) is a sporadic congenital condition characterised by ocular, cutaneous and central nervous system involvement. Mosaic activating variants in <i>FGFR1</i> and <i>KRAS</i> have been reported in several individuals with this syndrome. We report on a patient with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) with a germline pathogenic variant in the <i>NF1</i> gene and an ECCL phenotype, suggesting ECCL to be part of a spectrum of malformations associated with <i>NF1</i> pathogenic variants. An anatomical hemispherectomy was performed for intractable epilepsy. Through genetic analysis of blood, cerebral tissue and giant cell lesions in both jaws, we identified the germline <i>NF1</i> pathogenic variant in all samples and a second-hit pathogenic <i>NF1</i> variant in cerebral tissue and both giant cell lesions. Both <i>NF1</i> variants were located on different alleles resulting in somatic mosaicism for a biallelic <i>NF1</i> inactivation originating in early embryogenesis (second-hit mosaicism or Happle type 2 mosaicism). The biallelic deficit in <i>NF1</i> in the left hemicranium explains the severe localised, congenital abnormality in this patient. Identical first and second-hit variants in a giant cell lesion of both upper and lower jaws provide confirmatory evidence for an early embryonic second hit involving at least the neural crest. We suggest that the ECCL phenotype may be part of a spectrum of congenital problems associated with mosaic <i>NF1</i> nullisomy originating during early embryogenesis. The biallelic <i>NF1</i> inactivation during early embryogenesis mimics the severe activation of the RAS-MAPK pathway seen in ECCL caused by embryonic mosaic activating <i>FGFR1</i> and <i>KRAS</i> variants in the cranial region. We propose that distinct mechanisms of mosaicism can cause the ECCL phenotype through convergence on the RAS-MAPK pathway."

    "abstract": "Selumetinib is an oral, effective, and selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 and 2 (MEK1/2), which is clinically active in multiple tumor types, such as neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), melanoma, gliomas and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The purpose of this article was to assess the effects of selumetinib on the activities of twelve human UDP-glucosyltransferases (UGTs) including UGT1A1, 1A3, 1A4, 1A6, 1A7, 1A8, 1A9, 1A10, 2B4, 2B7, 2B15, and 2B17, and its potential for inducing clinical drug-drug interactions (DDIs). The results demonstrated that selumetinib potently inhibited the activity of UGT2B7 through the mechanism of mixed inhibition with the inhibition constant value of 5.79 ± 0.65 μM. Furthermore, the plasma concentration of UGT2B7 substrate as the co-administered drug was predicted to be increased by at least 84 % when patients took selumetinib 75 mg twice daily, suggesting a high potential to induce clinical DDIs. Selumetinib exhibited weak inhibitory effects on other human UGTs and was unlikely to trigger off UGTs-mediated DDIs except for UGT2B7. Therefore, the combination of selumetinib with the substrate drug of UGT2B7 requires additional attention to avoid adverse events in clinical treatment."

    "abstract": "Giant neurofibromas occurring in individuals diagnosed with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) often result in considerable disfigurement, functional impairment, and diminished quality of life. Although debulking surgery poses inherent risks of complications, it remains the most efficacious approach to address these issues. The primary objective of this study was to share our surgical experience with giant neurofibromas in the extremities and trunk wall of NF1 patients which may help surgeons to minimize intraoperative bleeding and facilitate tumor excision. A retrospective review was conducted at a single center, encompassing 36 NF1 patients with giant neurofibromas in the extremities and trunk wall who underwent debulking surgery from July 2010 to July 2022. Twenty-one male and fifteen female NF1 patients who received one to four surgical interventions were evaluated. The average age at the time of surgery was 17.8 years. The median follow-up time was 52 months. Our findings revealed relatively low rates of complications and recurrence. Notably, patients expressed satisfaction with both the aesthetic and functional results. Debulking surgery of giant neurofibromas in the extremities and trunk wall of NF1 patients can effectively reduce the tumor burden, leading to improvements in both the appearance and function."

    "abstract": "Expression patterns of key proteins involved in RAS signaling and connected pathways were determined and correlated to possibly provide information for therapeutic application of RAS inhibitors in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)-associated peripheral nerve sheath tumors (PNST). Clinical variables (age, sex), histological parameters (cell density, mitoses), and expression of immunohistochemically evaluated ligand and receptor proteins (neuregulin 1 (NRG1), ErbB2, ErbB3), RAS pathway proteins (mTor, Rho, phosphorylated MEK), transcription factors (Pax7, Sox9), and proliferation marker Ki-67, were correlated in cutaneous (CNF, n = 136), diffuse (DNF, n = 123)/diffuse plexiform (DPNF, n = 113), and plexiform neurofibroma (PNF, n = 126), and in malignant PNST (MPNST, n = 22). In CNF, NRG1 correlated with Ki-67 and Pax7. Further, mTOR correlated with ErbB3, Sox9, Pax7, and Ki-67. In DNF/DPNF, expression of NRG1 correlated with pMEK and Pax7. mTOR correlated with pMEK, Sox9, and Pax7. Noteworthy, pMEK was weakly expressed in some DNF but not in DPNF. ErbB3 correlated with mTor and Ki-67. Furthermore, Rho correlated with Pax7 and Ki-67. In PNF, ErbB3 expression was associated with Sox9, mTOR, pMEK, and Pax7 as well as mTOR with Sox9 and Pax7, Rho with pMEK and Pax7, and pMEK with Pax7 and Sox9. In MPNST, only few correlations were observed, ErbB2 correlated with Ki-67, and Rho with pMEK. Signaling networks of the RAS pathway could be retraced by correlation analysis of protein expression in subgroups of NF1 associated benign PNST. In regard to treatment of PNST, MEK inhibitors, which are presently evaluated for PNF, may possibly also be effective to some extent in DNF."

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 is a genetic disease that affects multiple organs and systems, leading to various clinical manifestations. In Neurofibromatosis type 1, rare intrathoracic meningoceles often occur alongside bone dysplasia. These meningoceles contain cerebrospinal fluid and can be mistakenly diagnosed as 'pleural effusion'. In this case report, we mistakenly identified 'cerebrospinal fluid' as 'pleural effusion' and proceeded with drainage. This error posed significant risks to the patient and holds valuable implications for the future diagnosis and treatment of similar patients. In patients with Neurofibromatosis type 1 complicated by spinal deformity, there is a high incidence of intrathoracic meningoceles. Treatment strategies may differ based on the specific features of the lesions, and collaboration among multiple disciplines can significantly improve patient outcomes."

    "abstract": "Neurogenetic disorders, such as neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), can cause cognitive and motor impairments, traditionally attributed to intrinsic neuronal defects such as disruption of synaptic function. Activity-regulated oligodendroglial plasticity also contributes to cognitive and motor functions by tuning neural circuit dynamics. However, the relevance of oligodendroglial plasticity to neurological dysfunction in NF1 is unclear. Here we explore the contribution of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) to pathological features of the NF1 syndrome in mice. Both male and female littermates (4-24 weeks of age) were used equally in this study. We demonstrate that mice with global or OPC-specific Nf1 heterozygosity exhibit defects in activity-dependent oligodendrogenesis and harbor focal OPC hyperdensities with disrupted homeostatic OPC territorial boundaries. These OPC hyperdensities develop in a cell-intrinsic Nf1 mutation-specific manner due to differential PI3K/AKT activation. OPC-specific Nf1 loss impairs oligodendroglial differentiation and abrogates the normal oligodendroglial response to neuronal activity, leading to impaired motor learning performance. Collectively, these findings show that Nf1 mutation delays oligodendroglial development and disrupts activity-dependent OPC function essential for normal motor learning in mice."

The French cNF-Skindex is the first questionnaire to specifically assess cNF-related QoL in patients with NF1. We aimed to adapt and validate a Dutch version of the cNF-Skindex. The questionnaire was translated using forward and backwards translation, and subsequently administered to a sample of 59 patients on two separate occasions. Feasibility was evaluated by the presence of floor/ceiling effects. Reliability was assessed by evaluating internal consistency and test-retest reliability, by calculating Cronbach's alpha and Spearman's rank correlation coefficients. The EQ-5D-5L and SF-36 were used to evaluate convergent validity, using Spearman's rank correlation coefficients. An exploratory factor analysis was performed to study the data's internal structure. Multivariable linear regression was used to model the relationship between patient characteristics and the cNF-Skindex. The Dutch cNF-Skindex demonstrated excellent feasibility and reliability (Cronbach's alpha 0.96, test-retest correlation coefficient 0.88). Convergent validity was confirmed for the EQ-5D-5L and relevant SF-36 scales. All items and subdomains from the original questionnaire were confirmed following exploratory factor analysis. The patient characteristics included in the multivariable linear regression were not significantly associated with the cNF-Skindex score. The Dutch cNF-Skindex displayed excellent psychometric properties, enabling use in the Netherlands."

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an inherited autosomal dominant disorder primarily affecting children and adolescents characterized by multisystemic clinical manifestations. Mutations in neurofibromin, the protein encoded by the <i>Nf1</i> tumor suppressor gene, result in dysregulation of the RAS/MAPK pathway leading to uncontrolled cell growth and migration. Neurofibromin is highly expressed in several cell lineages including melanocytes, glial cells, neurons, and Schwann cells. Individuals with NF1 possess a genetic predisposition to central nervous system neoplasms, particularly gliomas affecting the visual pathway, known as optic pathway gliomas (OPGs). While OPGs are typically asymptomatic and benign, they can induce visual impairment in some patients. This review provides insight into the spectrum and visual outcomes of NF1, current diagnostic techniques and therapeutic interventions, and explores the influence of NF1-OPGS on visual abnormalities. We focus on recent advancements in preclinical animal models to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of NF1 pathology and therapies targeting NF1-OPGs. Overall, our review highlights the involvement of retinal ganglion cell dysfunction and degeneration in NF1 disease, and the need for further research to transform scientific laboratory discoveries to improved patient outcomes."

An [<sup>18</sup>F] 2-Fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose PET/CT (FDG-PET/CT) was performed to detect and stage a conspicuous symptomatic cervical tumor. The FDG-PET/CT showed high FDG uptake in one of the multiple known tumorous lesions associated with peripheral nerves. However, no relevant FDP uptake was observed in this affected cervical area. After digital subtraction angiography, the cervical mass turned out to be a widespread arteriovenous fistula of the vertebral artery. This was successfully treated using endovascular embolization. Subsequently, magnet resonance imaging (MRI) of the FDG-positive tumor revealed a well-enhanced homogeneous mass of the sciatic nerve measuring 5.2×2.4×2.8 cm. Microsurgical gross total tumor resection was performed using ultrasound. The final histopathological diagnosis was ANNUBP transformed from neurofibroma. The patient benefited excellently from the surgery; no recurrence or metastasis has been observed since resection. According to imaging, ANNUBP can be characterized as a well-enhanced homogeneous mass on MRI, displaying high uptake on FDG-PET/CT and hypoechogenic in ultrasound."

    "abstract": "Pheochromocytoma can recur years after curative surgical resection. Rarely, it may reoccur as metastasis. Here, we present a case of metastatic pheochromocytoma to the bones in a patient with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), 8 years after initial resection of primary bilateral adrenal pheochromocytomas without metastases. A 44-year-old woman presented with diffuse body pain and palpitations. Her past medical history included NF1 and hypertension. Eight years prior to her current presentation, she had undergone a bilateral adrenalectomy for the management of bilateral adrenal pheochromocytomas. Her plasma metanephrines normalized after surgery and remained normal at her 1-year postoperative visit. She was subsequently lost to follow-up until her current presentation. Our evaluation revealed significantly elevated urine and plasma metanephrines as well as innumerable DOTATATE avid lesions along the axial and perpendicular spine compatible with a metastatic neuroendocrine tumor. She was started on doxazosin and metoprolol and discharged home with a plan to be seen by Oncology to discuss systemic therapy. Predicting malignant disease in patients with primary tumors without metastases is challenging. There is no single factor that can reliably predict tumor behavior. It is unknown if individuals with NF1, who have a genetic predisposition for developing pheochromocytomas, are at an increased risk of malignant disease. Due to a lack of accurate predictors, annual biochemical testing is recommended after primary tumor resection and in patients with a genetic predisposition. Strict lifelong follow-up should be strongly considered due to a possible higher risk of malignant disease."

    "abstract": "We presented the clinical case of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1) associated with pheochromocytoma (PHEO) in a man under 40 years old without family history. The diagnosis of NF-1 was established based on 4 signs of the disease (multiple café au lait macules, scoliotic changes in posture, the presence of multiple neurofibromas, Lisch nodules). The diagnosis of PHEO was determined by a significant increase of free metanephrin/normethanephrin levels in daily urine, a malignant CT phenotype of the right adrenal tumor, and confirmed by pathomorphological study. Genetic tests revealed a new mutation in one of the alleles of NF1 gene, a deletion of a 566 bp gene fragment, including exon 19 with a size of 73 bp. This mutation leads to splicing of exons 18 and 20, frameshift, and termination of protein synthesis. A study of the level of transcription of the genes associated with PHEO (RET, TMEM127, MAX, FGFR, MET, MERTK, BRAF, NGFR, Pi3, AKT, MTOR, KRAS, MAPK) was conducted, a statistically significant decrease in the level of transcription of the KRAS and BRAF genes and increase in the level of transcription of the TMEM127 gene in comparison with control samples have been detected. This case demonstrates the need for timely recognition of NF-1 for further appropriate patient's follow up and show the effectiveness of a multidisciplinary approach to the diagnosis and treatment of NF-1-associated catecholamine-secreting tumors."

    "abstract": "When stroke occurs in pediatric age, it might be mistakenly interpreted as non-accidental head injury (NAHI). In these situations, a multidisciplinary approach is fundamental, including a thorough personal and familial history, along with accurate physical examination and additional investigations. Especially when the clinical picture is uncertain, it is important to remember that certain genetic conditions can cause bleeding inside the brain, which may resemble NAHI. Pediatric strokes occurring around the time of birth can also be an initial sign of undiagnosed genetic disorders. Hence, it is crucial to conduct a thorough evaluation, including genetic testing, when there is a suspicion of NAHI but the symptoms are unclear. In these cases, a characteristic set of symptoms is often observed. This study aims to summarize some of the genetic causes of hemorrhagic stroke in the pediatric population, thus mimicking non-accidental head injury, considering elements that can be useful in characterizing pathologies. A systematic review of genetic disorders that may cause ICH in children was carried out according to the Preferred Reporting Item for Systematic Review (PRISMA) standards. We selected 10 articles regarding the main genetic diseases in stroke; we additionally selected 11 papers concerning patients with pediatric stroke and genetic diseases, or studies outlining the characteristics of stroke in these patients. The disorders we identified were Moyamoya disease (MMD), <i>COL4A1</i>, <i>COL4A2</i> pathogenic variant, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (E-D), neurofibromatosis type 1 (Nf1), sickle cell disease (SCD), cerebral cavernous malformations (CCM), hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) and Marfan syndrome.

    "abstract": "Thoracic myelopathy in neuro fibromatosis-1 (NF-1) is most commonly due to intra-spinal neurofibromas/dumb-bell tumors/intra-canal rib head penetration (RHP) causing cord compression. However, acute thoracic myelopathy due to rapid progression of the kyphoscoliotic curve alone in NF-1 without a significant spinal cord compression occurs very rarely. This case report discusses our experience with one such patient and we also discuss intraoperative and post-operative challenges encountered with this patient and a rare complication of hemothorax postoperatively. A 15-year-old male presented to the clinic after being lost to follow-up for 4 years with a rapid acute deterioration of dystrophic curve and no myelopathic symptoms (Scoliosis - 65°, Kyphosis - 77°). His subsequent examination in 6 weeks showed acute development of myelopathic gait with right ankle and extensor hallucis longus weakness. He was admitted for halo gravity traction for 6 weeks and a single-stage posterior instrumentation with excision of rib heads at the apex was planned. Postoperatively, the patient developed massive left hemothorax and loss of power in both lower limbs at day 2. He subsequently regained full power and complete resolution of myelopathic symptoms at the end of 9- month follow-up with a satisfactory alignment of spine in the follow-up X-rays. Acute onset of myelopathy is a rare and uncommon finding with a rapid deterioration of dystrophic curve alone without any major spinal cord compromise. Early detection of dysplastic changes with early aggressive surgical management and deformity correction is necessary with dystrophic NF-1 curves to prevent pre-operative and post-operative morbidities."

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant syndrome caused by germline alteration of the NF1gene. Among various NF1-related manifestations, obstructive hydrocephalus especially in adult NF1 cases is less frequently found. We report two adult NF1 cases exhibiting obstructive hydrocephalus due to an aggressive posterior fossa tumor exhibiting pathological characteristics of pilocytic astrocytoma as NF1-related manifestations. In these two cases, we performed endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) and tumor biopsy as an initial treatment. The initial pathological diagnosis of the tumor is conventional pilocytic astrocytoma. After biopsy both cases revealed rapid tumor growth, therefore, we performed tumor removal, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy during an aggressive clinical course. However, both cases revealed dismal prognosis due to the progression of the tumor in spite of successful management of hydrocephalus by an initial ETV. DNA methylation analysis revealed that the tumor of one case matched high-grade astrocytoma with piloid features (HGAP). Most central nervous system tumors developed in NF1 are less aggressive such as pilocytic astrocytoma; however, recently a few studies revealed that HGAP, which has been a newly introduced malignant tumor in the World Health Organization Classification of Tumors of the Central Nervous System, 5th edition (WHO CNS 5), rarely develops in NF1 cases. These findings suggested that HGAP might be one of the important causes of obstructive hydrocephalus in adult NF1 cases."

    "abstract": "Currently, anterior-only (AO), posterior-only, and combined anterior-posterior spinal fusions are common strategies for treating cervical kyphosis in patients with neurofibromatosis-1 NF-1. Nevertheless, the choice of surgical strategy remains a topic of controversy. The aim of our study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of anterior decompression and spinal reconstruction for the treatment of cervical kyphosis in patients with NF-1. Twelve patients with NF-1-associated cervical kyphotic deformity were reviewed retrospectively between January 2010 and April 2020. All patients underwent AO correction and reconstruction. The X-ray was followed up in all these patients to assess the preoperative and postoperative local kyphosis angle (LKA), the global kyphosis angle (GKA), the sagittal vertical axis, and the T1 slope. The visual analog scale score, Japanese Orthopedic Association (JOA) score, and neck disability index (NDI) score were used to evaluate the improvement inclinical symptoms. The results of the difference in improvement from preoperatively to the final follow-up assessment were assessed using a paired t-test or Mann-Whitney U-test. The LKA and GKA decreased from the preoperative average of 64.42 (range, 38-86) and 35.50 (range, 10-81) to an average of 16.83 (range, -2 to 46) and 4.25 (range, -22 to 39) postoperatively, respectively. The average correction rates of the LKA and GKA were 76.11% and 111.97%, respectively. All patients had achieved satisfactory relief of neurological symptoms (p < 0.01). JOA scores were improved from 10.42 (range, 8-16) preoperatively to 15.25 (range, 11-18) at final follow-up (p < 0.01). NDI scores were decreased from an average of 23.25 (range, 16-34) preoperatively to an average of 7.08 (range, 3-15) at the final follow-up (p < 0.01). Anterior-only correction and reconstruction is a safe and effective method for correcting cervical kyphosis in NF-1 patients. In fixed cervical kyphosis cases, preoperative skull traction should also be considered."

A human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) line was derived from a pediatric patient with NF1 and epilepsy, harboring a heterozygous NF1 gene mutation. The iPSC line exhibits high levels of pluripotency markers, maintains the NF1 gene mutation, and demonstrates the capacity to undergo differentiation potential in vitro into three germ layers. The iPSC line will serve as a valuable resource for investigating the underlying mechanisms and conducting drug screening related to NF1 and NF1-associated epilepsy."

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a multisystem neurocutaneous disorder. Scoliosis and dural ectasia are features of the associated mesodermal dysplasia. Lateral thoracic meningoceles can develop in NF1 and progressively enlarge due to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pulsations. Large meningoceles can cause compressive symptoms in the thorax. We are reporting a case of a NF1 presenting with acute onset respiratory distress, who also had chronic orthostatic headaches. CT chest showed unruptured enlarging bilateral lateral thoracic meningoceles causing lung compression. MRI of the brain and spine showed features of CSF hypotension, explaining the headaches. CSF hypotension with unruptured meningoceles is extremely rare. Management of the condition is challenging since surgical removal is prone to complications due to underlying mesodermal abnormalities. Cystoperitoneal shunting to relieve lung compression may worsen CSF hypotension. A shunt with a programmable valve allowed controlled drainage and successfully relieved lung compression without worsening of orthostatic headaches in our case."

    "abstract": "Moyamoya disease and syndrome represent rare entities characterized by progressive stenosis and/or occlusion of the intracranial blood vessels. We present our series of patients with moyamoya disease and syndrome stratified by underlying disease and analyze differences in presentation and outcome following surgical revascularization. This was an Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved, retrospective review of all patients surgically revascularized by the senior author (SNM) while at Children's National Hospital in Washington, DC. Demographic data, presenting symptoms and severity, surgical details, and functional and radiographic outcomes were obtained and analyzed for differences among the underlying cohorts of moyamoya disease and syndrome as well as by unilateral or bilateral disease and index or non-index surgeries. Twenty-two patients were identified with the following underlying diseases: six with idiopathic moyamoya disease, six with sickle cell anemia, five with trisomy 21, and five with neurofibromatosis type 1. Thirty hemispheres were revascularized with a significantly reduced rate of stroke from 3.19 strokes/year (SD = 3.10) to 0.13 strokes/year (SD = 0.25), p = 0.03. When analyzed by underlying cause of moyamoya syndrome, patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 were found to be significantly less likely than the other subtypes of moyamoya syndrome to have had either a clinical stroke (0.0% neurofibromatosis type 1 vs. 100.0% sickle cell, 60.0% trisomy 21, or 83.3% moyamoya disease, p < 0.01) or radiographic stroke (0.0% neurofibromatosis type 1 vs. 100.0% sickle cell, 60.0% trisomy 21, or 83.3% moyamoya disease, p < 0.01) at time of presentation. Patients with moyamoya syndrome associated with sickle cell disease were more likely to present with clinical and radiographic strokes. Additionally, patients with bilateral disease demonstrated no difference in final functional outcome compared to patients with unilateral disease (mRS 0.73 (SD = 1.33) vs. 1.29 (SD = 1.60), p = 0.63). Indirect surgical revascularization decreases stroke risk for pediatric patients with different forms of moyamoya disease and moyamoya syndrome. Additionally, these data suggest that sickle cell anemia-associated moyamoya syndrome may represent a more aggressive variant, while neurofibromatosis type 1 may represent a more benign variant."

    "abstract": "Pheochromocytoma is a tumor that usually originating from adrenal medullary chromaffin cells and producing one or more catecholamines, can manifest as hereditary or sporadic. While the majority pheochromocytomas are sporadic, hereditary forms are often associated with genetic syndromes such as von Hippel-Lindau, multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2, and neurofibromatosis type 1. This study aims to analyze data from our series of surgically excited pheochromocytoma patients and compare the characteristics between hereditary and sporadic cases. We retrospectively evaluated 33 diagnosed pheochromocytoma patients, documenting clinical features, surgical complications, and tumor characteristics in both hereditary and sporadic cases. Among the patients, 21% (7 individuals) had hereditary pheochromocytoma, while 79% (26 individuals) had sporadic cases. During diagnosis, hereditary pheochromocytoma patients exhibited a significantly lower mean age compared to the sporadic group (26.4 ± 9.9 years vs. 50.4 ± 14.0 years; p < 0.001). The maximum tumor size was also lower in hereditary cases compared to sporadic cases (p = 0.004). Adrenal tumor localization analysis showed that 63.6% were right-sided, 24.2% were left-sided, and 12.1% were bilateral. Laboratory analysis revealed significantly higher urinary norepinephrine levels in hereditary pheochromocytoma patients (p = 0.021). Our findings suggest that hereditary pheochromocytoma cases are characterized by a younger age at diagnosis, smaller tumor size, and a higher prevalence of multiple bilateral adrenal adenomas. We recommend genetic testing for all pheochromocytoma patients, particularly those with early-onset disease and bilateral adrenal tumors."

Nevertheless, they can cover a significant proportion of the body, with some individuals developing hundreds to thousands of lesions. cNFs can cause pain, itching, and disfigurement resulting in substantial socio-emotional repercussions. Currently, surgery and laser desiccation are the sole treatment options but may result in scarring and potential regrowth from incomplete removal. To identify effective systemic therapies, we introduce an approach to establish and screen cNF organoids. We optimized conditions to support the ex vivo growth of genomically diverse cNFs. Patient-derived cNF organoids closely recapitulate cellular and molecular features of parental tumors as measured by immunohistopathology, methylation, RNA sequencing, and flow cytometry. Our cNF organoid platform enables rapid screening of hundreds of compounds in a patient- and tumor-specific manner."

We present a case of a 52-year-old male patient with neurofibromatosis type 1 who developed an intramedullary spinal cord abscess after a previous resection of a cervical intradural, extramedullary neurofibroma. A 52-year-old male with a history of neurofibromatosis type 1 had previously undergone multiple resections of cervical intradural, extramedullary neurofibromas with internal stabilization. Sixteen months after his initial surgery, he developed acute-onset interscapular pain with bilateral lower extremity pain and left hemi-body weakness. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the cervical spine demonstrated an enlarging contrast-enhancing intramedullary lesion. Surgical exploration and evacuation of the lesion were completed. Intramedullary cultures confirmed a <i>Serratia marcescens</i> abscess. After abscess evacuation and intravenous antibiotics, the patient's symptoms resolved. Given the potential for permanent neurologic damage and loss of independence with intramedullary spinal cord abscess, we advocate that clinicians maintain a high index of suspicion in the postsurgical patient. Diagnostic imaging through contrasted MRI or computed tomography myelogram should be obtained, and prompt intervention, including evacuation and/or antibiotics, should be implemented for the best chance of a favorable outcome."

Characteristic cardiac phenotypes of NS, including specific electrocardiographic changes, pulmonary valve stenosis and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy have not been completely studied in NF1. The aims of this study were to assess: (1) similarities in the prevalence and types of ECG and conventional echocardiographic findings described in NS in asymptomatic patients with NF1, and (2) the presence of discrete myocardial dysfunction in NF1 patients using myocardial strain imaging. Fifty-eight patients with NF1 (ages 0-18 years), and thirty-one age-matched healthy controls underwent cardiac assessment including blood pressure measurements, a 12-lead ECG, and detailed echocardiography. Quantification of cardiac chamber size, mass and function were measured using conventional echocardiography. Myocardial strain parameters were assessed using 2-Dimensional (2D) Speckle tracking echocardiography. Asymptomatic patients with NF1 had normal electrocardiograms, none with the typical ECG patterns described in NS. However, patients with NF1 showed significantly decreased calculated Z scores of the left ventricular internal diameter in diastole and systole, reduced left ventricular mass index and a higher incidence of cardiac abnormal findings, mainly of the mitral valve, in contrast to the frequently described types of cardiac abnormalities in NS. Peak and end systolic global circumferential strain were the only significantly reduced speckle tracking derived myocardial strain parameter. Children with NF1 demonstrated more dissimilarities than similarities in the prevalence and types of ECG and conventional echocardiographic findings described in NS. The role of the abnormal myocardial strain parameter needs to be explored."

In this proof-of-concept study, we demonstrate single-cell RNA sequencing(scRNAseq) as a technique for quantifying drug response to selumetinib at the single cell level. scRNAseq data from neurofibroma biopsies was obtained from a public genomics repository. Schwann cell populations were identified through standard clustering techniques and single-cell selumetinib sensitivity was quantified on a scale of 0(resistant) to 1(sensitive) based on the expression pattern of a 500 gene selumetinib sensitivity signature from the BeyondCell sensitivity library. A total of seven plexiform neurofibromas were included in our final analysis. The median absolute number of Schwann cells across samples was 658 cells (IQR: 1,029 cells, Q1-Q3: 135 cells to 1,163 cells). There was a statistically significant difference in selumetinib sensitivity profiles across samples (p < 0.001). The tumor with the highest median selumetinib sensitivity score had a median selumetinib sensitivity score of 0.64(IQR: 0.14, Q1-Q3: 0.59-0.70, n = 112 cells) and the tumor with the lowest median selumetinib sensitivity score had a median score of 0.37 (IQR: 0.21, Q1-Q3: 0.27-0.48, n = 1,034 cells). scRNAseq of plexiform neurofibroma biopsies reveals differential susceptibilities to selumetinib on a single cell level. These findings may explain the partial responses seen in clinical trials of selumetinib for NF1 and demonstrate the value of collecting scRNAseq data for future NF1 trials."

The presence of these lesions in the corpus callosum (CC) has not been previously studied in a large cohort. We reviewed medical records of 681 patients (aged three months to 86 years) followed at our institution from 2000 to 2023 with NF1 and one or more brain MRI. Patients with lesions in the CC were identified, and RAPNO/RANO criteria were used to determine changes in size over time, where a change of 25% in the product of perpendicular measurements indicates growth or shrinkage. Forty-seven patients had CC UBOs, most of which were in the splenium (66.0%). Seventeen patients had CC gliomas (10% of those with any glioma), two of whom had two gliomas. Seventeen of 19 gliomas were in the splenium. Over follow-up, eight of 19 remained stable, three shrunk, and eight grew. The mean percentage change in the product of the dimensions was 311.5% (ranging from -46.7% to 2566.6%). Of the eight lesions that grew, one required treatment. There is a 6.9% and 2.5% prevalence of CC UBOs and gliomas, respectively, in our cohort of patients with NF1. Most lesions are present in the splenium, and although some gliomas demonstrate significant growth, they rarely require treatment.

The patient was a 55-year-old man with an omega deformity, which is defined as a curvature in which the end vertebra is positioned at the level of, above, or below the apical vertebra (i.e., a horizontal line bisecting it). We performed halo gravity traction (HGT) for 7 weeks, followed by posterior spinal instrumented nearly equal in situ fusion from T2-L5 with three femoral head allografts and a local bone autograft. We avoided reconstruction of the thoracic anterior spine because of his severe pulmonary dysfunction. HGT improved the % vital capacity from 32.5 to 43.5%, and improved the Cobb angle of the kyphosis from > 180° before traction to 144° after traction. The Cobb angle of kyphosis and scoliosis changed from > 180° preoperatively to 155° and 146°, respectively, postoperatively, and 167° and 156°, respectively, at final follow-up. His postoperative respiratory function deteriorated transiently due to bilateral pleural effusions and compressive atelectasis, which was successfully treated with a frequent change of position and nasal high flow for 1 week. At final follow-up, his pulmonary function improved from 0.86 to 1.04 L in VC, and from 32.5 to 37.9% in %VC. However, there was no overall improvement in preoperative distress following surgery, although his modified Borg scale improved from 3 preoperatively to 0.5 postoperatively. One month after discharge, he felt worsening respiratory distress (SpO2:75%) and was readmitted for pulmonary hypertension for 2 months. He was improved by non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (biphasic positive airway pressure) for 1 week, medication and daily lung physiotherapy. Thereafter, he has been receiving permanent daytime (0.5 L/min) and nighttime (2 L/min) oxygen therapy at home. A solid arthrodesis through the fusion area was confirmed on computed tomography. However, the kyphosis correction loss was 12° (i.e., 155°-167°), while the scoliosis correction loss was 10° (i.e., 146°-156°) at 2 years of recovery. We suggest that nearly equal in situ fusion is a valid option for preventing further deformity deterioration and avoiding fatal complications."

    "abstract": "Individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1, an autosomal dominant neurogenetic and tumor predisposition syndrome, are susceptible to developing low-grade glioma and less commonly high-grade glioma. These gliomas exhibit loss of the neurofibromin gene [neurofibromin type 1 (NF1)], and 10% to 15% of sporadic high-grade gliomas have somatic NF1 alterations. Loss of NF1 leads to hyperactive RAS signaling, creating opportunity given the established efficacy of MEK inhibitors in plexiform neurofibromas and some individuals with low-grade glioma. We observed that NF1-deficient glioblastoma neurospheres were sensitive to the combination of an MEK inhibitor (mirdametinib) with irradiation, as evidenced by synergistic inhibition of cell growth, colony formation, and increased cell death. In contrast, NF1-intact neurospheres were not sensitive to the combination, despite complete ERK pathway inhibition. No neurosphere lines exhibited enhanced sensitivity to temozolomide combined with mirdametinib. Mirdametinib decreased transcription of homologous recombination genes and RAD51 foci, associated with DNA damage repair, in sensitive models. Heterotopic xenograft models displayed synergistic growth inhibition to mirdametinib combined with irradiation in NF1-deficient glioma xenografts but not in those with intact NF1. In sensitive models, benefits were observed at least 3 weeks beyond the completion of treatment, including sustained phosphor-ERK inhibition on immunoblot and decreased Ki-67 expression. These observations demonstrate synergistic activity between mirdametinib and irradiation in NF1-deficient glioma models and may have clinical implications for patients with gliomas that harbor germline or somatic NF1 alterations."

This case demonstrates LNC's efficacy as a surgical alternative for palatal SNF, offering a non-invasive option for patients declining surgery. The positive outcome warrants further research into LNC's role in managing similar benign lesions."

    "abstract": "Most malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are clinically aggressive high-grade sarcomas, arising in individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) at a significantly elevated estimated lifetime frequency of 8%-13%. In the setting of NF1, MPNSTs arise from malignant transformation of benign plexiform neurofibroma and borderline atypical neurofibromas. Composed of neoplastic cells from the Schwannian lineage, these cancers recur in approximately 50% of individuals, and most patients die within five years of diagnosis, despite surgical resection, radiation, and chemotherapy. Treatment for metastatic disease is limited to cytotoxic chemotherapy and investigational clinical trials. In this article, we review the pathophysiology of this aggressive cancer and current approaches to surveillance and treatment."

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1) is a cancer predisposition syndrome caused by mutations in the NF1 tumor suppressor gene that encodes the neurofibromin protein, which functions as a negative regulator of Ras signaling. We review the past, current, and future state of therapeutic strategies for tumors associated with NF-1. Therapeutic efforts for NF-1-associated tumors have centered around inhibiting Ras output, leading to the clinical success of downstream MEK inhibition for plexiform neurofibromas and low-grade gliomas. However, MEK inhibition and similar molecular monotherapy approaches that block Ras signaling do not work for all patients and show limited efficacy for more aggressive cancers such as malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors and high-grade gliomas, motivating novel treatment approaches. We highlight the current therapeutic landscape for NF-1-associated tumors, broadly categorizing treatment into past strategies for serial Ras pathway blockade, current approaches targeting parallel oncogenic and tumor suppressor pathways, and future avenues of investigation leveraging biologic and technical innovations in immunotherapy, pharmacology, and gene delivery."

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant cancer predisposition syndrome characterized by the development of both central and peripheral nervous system tumors. Low-grade glioma (LGG) is the most prevalent central nervous system tumor occurring in children with NF1, arising most frequently within the optic pathway, followed by the brainstem. Historically, treatment of NF1-LGG has been limited to conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy and surgery. Despite treatment with chemotherapy, a subset of children with NF1-LGG fail initial therapy, have a continued decline in function, or recur. The recent development of several preclinical models has allowed for the identification of novel, molecularly targeted therapies. At present, exploration of these novel precision-based therapies is ongoing in the preclinical setting and through larger, collaborative clinical trials. Herein, we review the approach to surveillance and management of NF1-LGG in children and discuss upcoming novel therapies and treatment protocols."

    "abstract": "Moyamoya arteriopathy can develop in patients with brain tumors, particularly when associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) or cranial irradiation. The present study aimed to analyze the clinical outcomes of moyamoya after brain tumor treatment and elucidate the effect of revascularization on brain tumors. The authors retrospectively reviewed clinical and radiographic findings in 27 patients with brain tumors who developed moyamoya requiring revascularization surgery between January 1985 and June 2017 at a single institution. The long-term clinical and neuroimaging-based outcomes were analyzed. Among 27 patients, 22 patients underwent radiotherapy, and 12 patients had NF1. The mean ages at diagnosis of brain tumors and moyamoya were 4.4 years and 10.3 years, respectively. The mean interval between radiotherapy and moyamoya diagnosis was 4.0 years. The mean follow-up period after revascularization surgery was 8.5 years. Among 46 affected hemispheres in 27 patients, the patients who underwent radiotherapy (30 hemispheres in 22 patients) had a higher incidence of Suzuki stage 5 or 6 (20% [6/30] vs 0% [0/8]) and infarction (63.6% [14/22] vs 0% [0/5]) compared with patients without radiotherapy (8 hemispheres in 5 patients). After revascularization, stroke occurred in 4 patients, and 6 hemispheres showed Matsushima grade C, all of which occurred in patients with a history of radiotherapy. The residual brain tumors progressed in 4 of 21 patients (19%) after revascularization, comparable to the progression rates of brain tumors without revascularization in previous literature. Patients with brain tumors can develop moyamoya that exhibits characteristic clinical and radiographic features of idiopathic MMD. Moyamoya associated with cranial irradiation has a higher incidence of stroke with less capacity for revascularization, requiring thorough evaluations and timely treatment. Revascularization does not appear to have any effect on the progression of existing brain tumors."

Although lung involvement in the form of cysts and bullae occurs in up to 20% of adults, the seemingly intuitive association of NF1 and spontaneous pneumothorax is not widely recognised among clinicians. Here, we report the second case of recurring spontaneous pneumothorax in the context of NF1 with a confirmed molecular diagnosis. In both cases, the NF1 variants featured a premature stop codon in the C-terminal protein domain. Interestingly, our patient had mild skin symptoms, suggesting that spontaneous pneumothorax may not be correlated with cutaneous disease severity. More genotype-phenotype correlation studies are needed for NF1 in general and for its link to spontaneous pneumothorax in particular."

    "abstract": "Patients with Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), the most common neurocutaneous disorder, can develop several neurological manifestations that include cognitive impairments and epilepsy over their lifetime. It is unclear why certain patients with NF1 develop these conditions while others do not. Early-life immune activation promotes later-life seizure susceptibility, neurocognitive impairments, and leads to spontaneous seizures in some animal models of neurodevelopmental disorders, but the central nervous system immune profile and the enduring consequences of early-life immune activation on the developmental trajectory of the brain in NF1 have not yet been explored. We tested the hypothesis that early-life immune activation promotes the development of spatial memory impairments and epileptogenesis in a mouse model of NF1. Male wild-type (WT) and <i>Nf1<sup>+/-</sup></i> mice received systemic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or saline at post-natal day 10 and were assessed in adulthood for learning and memory deficits in the Barnes maze and underwent EEG recordings to look for spontaneous epileptiform abnormalities and susceptibility to challenge with pentylenetetrazole (PTZ). Whereas early-life immune activation by a single injection of LPS acutely elicited a comparable brain cytokine signature in WT and <i>Nf1</i><sup><i>+/</i>-</sup> mice, it promoted spontaneous seizure activity in adulthood only in the <i>Nf1</i><sup><i>+/</i>-</sup> mice. Early-life immune activation affected susceptibility to PTZ-induced seizures similarly in both WT and <i>Nf1<sup>+/-</sup></i>mice. There was no effect on spatial learning and memory regardless of mouse genotype. Our findings suggest <i>second-hit</i> environmental events such as early-life immune activation may promote epileptogenesis in the <i>Nf1<sup>+/-</sup></i> mouse and may be a risk-factor for NF1-associated epilepsy."

NF1 is a tumor predisposition syndrome that primarily affect the peripheral and central nervous systems via the impact of haploinsufficiency upon neural crest lineage cells including Schwann cells, melanocytes, fibroblasts, etc. NF1 can further lead to pathology of the skin, bones, visual system, and cardiovascular system, all of which can drastically reduce a patient's quality of life (QOL). This review provides a comprehensive examination of the many specialties required for the care of patients with Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1). We delve into the pathogenesis and clinical presentation of NF1, highlighting its diverse manifestations and the challenges they pose in management. The review underscores the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to NF1, emphasizing how such an approach can significantly improve patient outcomes and overall QOL. Central to this approach is the role of the NF expert, who guides a multidisciplinary team (MDT) comprising healthcare professionals from many areas of expertise. The MDT collaboratively addresses the multifaceted needs of NF1 patients, ensuring comprehensive and personalized care. This review highlights the need for further investigation to optimize the workflow for NF1 patients in an MDT setting, and to improve implementation and efficacy."

To date, although the hypothesis of impaired social cognition has been proposed as a potential explanation for these difficulties, very few studies have focused on theory of mind in children with NF1. Furthermore, other complex sociocognitive abilities have never been investigated. The aim of the present study was to assess theory of mind, moral reasoning, and social information processing in children with NF1 compared with a control group. We administered the Paediatric Evaluation of Emotions, Relationships and Socialization® to 38 children with NF1 aged between 8 years and 16 years 11 months (mean = 11.4, <i>SD</i> = 2.3) and 43 control children with comparable sociodemographic characteristics. Patients performed significantly worse than controls on moral reasoning and social information processing tests, but there was no significant difference on theory of mind. These results seem to confirm the presence of social cognition difficulties in NF1 that could explain, at least in part, their social difficulties, although not all dimensions are concerned. The differences between the processes we assessed are discussed in relation to the methodologies used to measure them, and raises questions about the complementarity of traditional tools and more ecological assessments."

    "abstract": "Aim of the report: Brooke-Spiegler syndrome (BSS) is a rare autosomal dominant disease characterized by the growth of cylindromas, spiradenomas, trichoepitheliomas, or their combination. These neoplasms usually begin in the second decade and progressively increase in number and size over the years. Diagnosis necessitates consideration of family history, clinical examination, histological findings, and genetic analysis. The aim of this paper is to explore the clinical overlap between Brooke-Spiegler syndrome (BSS) and neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). We aim to highlight the challenges associated with their differential diagnosis and emphasize the lack of standardized diagnostic criteria and treatment approaches. Case presentation: Hereby, we introduce the case of a 28-year-old male referred for suspicion of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) who initially declined the recommended surgical excision for a scalp mass. After four years, he returned with larger masses of the scalp, and underwent excision of multiple masses, revealing cylindromas, spiradenomas, and spiradenocylindromas. Family history reported similar tumors in his father, who was also diagnosed with NF1 for the presence of multiple subcutaneous lesions on the scalp. Clinical overlap led to a genetic consultation, but testing for CYLD mutations yielded no significant variations. Despite this, the strong family history and consistent findings led to a revised diagnosis of Brooke-Spiegler syndrome, correcting the initial misdiagnosis of NF1 syndrome. Conclusions: Thanks to the evolving landscape of BSS research over the past two decades, its molecular underpinnings, clinical presentation, and histopathological features are now clearer. However, a thorough family history assessment is mandatory when BSS is suspected. It is our belief that a multidisciplinary approach and cooperation between specialists are essential when dealing with BSS. By sharing this case, we hope to underscore the importance of considering BSS as a differential diagnosis, especially in cases with atypical presentations or overlapping features with other syndromes like NF1."

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) is a multisymptomatic disorder with highly variable presentations, which include short stature, susceptibility to formation of the characteristic benign tumors known as neurofibromas, intense freckling and skin discoloration, and cognitive deficits, which characterize most children with the condition. Attention deficits and Autism Spectrum manifestations augment the compromised learning presented by most patients, leading to behavioral problems and school failure, while fragmented sleep contributes to chronic fatigue and poor quality of life. Neurofibromin (Nf1) is present ubiquitously during human development and postnatally in most neuronal, oligodendrocyte, and Schwann cells. Evidence largely from animal models including <i>Drosophila</i> suggests that the symptomatic variability may reflect distinct cell-type-specific functions of the protein, which emerge upon its loss, or mutations affecting the different functional domains of the protein. This review summarizes the contributions of <i>Drosophila</i> in modeling multiple NF1 manifestations, addressing hypotheses regarding the cell-type-specific functions of the protein and exploring the molecular pathways affected upon loss of the highly conserved fly homolog dNf1. Collectively, work in this model not only has efficiently and expediently modelled multiple aspects of the condition and increased understanding of its behavioral manifestations, but also has led to pharmaceutical strategies towards their amelioration."

    "abstract": "Genetic analysis of sporadic medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) has revealed somatic variants in <i>RET</i>, <i>RAS</i>, and occasionally other genes. However, around 20% of patients with sporadic MTC lack a known genetic driver. To uncover potential new somatic or germline drivers, we analyze a distinct cohort of patients with sporadic, very early-onset, and aggressive MTC. Germline and somatic DNA exome sequencing was performed in 19 patients, previously tested negative for germline <i>RET</i> variants. Exome sequencing of 19 germline samples confirmed the absence of <i>RET</i> and identified an <i>NF1</i> pathogenic variant in 1 patient. Somatic sequencing was successful in 15 tumors revealing <i>RET</i> variants in 80%, predominantly p.Met918Thr, which was associated with disease aggressiveness. In <i>RET</i>-negative tumors, pathogenic variants were found in <i>HRAS</i> and <i>NF1</i>. The <i>NF1</i> germline and somatic variants were observed in a patient without a prior clinical diagnosis of neurofibromatosis type 1, demonstrating that the loss of heterozygosity of <i>NF1</i> functions as a potential MTC driver. Somatic copy number alterations analysis revealed chromosomal alterations in 53.3% of tumors, predominantly in <i>RET</i>-positive cases, with losses in chromosomes 9 and 22 being the most prevalent. This study reveals that within a cohort of early-onset nonhereditary MTC, <i>RET</i> remains the major driver gene. In <i>RET</i>-negative tumors, <i>NF1</i> and <i>RAS</i> are drivers of sporadic MTC. In addition, in young patients without a <i>RET</i> germline mutation, a careful clinical evaluation with a consideration of germline <i>NF1</i> gene analysis is ideal to exclude Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)."

Complications of NF1 can include pigmented lesions, skin neurofibromas, and heart problems such as cardiomyopathy.

Following clinical assessment, WES was used to identify genetic variants in a family with a son suffering from NF1. No symptomatic manifestations were observed in other family members. In the studied family, in silico and segregation analysis were applied to survey candidate variants. Clinical manifestations were consistent with arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM). WES detected a likely pathogenic heterozygous missense variant, c.3277G > A:p.Val1093Met, in the NF1 gene, confirmed by PCR and Sanger sequencing. The patient's parents and brother had a normal sequence at this locus. Although there is no cure for NF1, genetic tests, such as WES, can detect at-risk asymptomatic family members.

Rapid weakening in the patient's right arm and leg prompted imaging revealing severe cervical kyphotic deformity and a dural fold dividing the spinal cord. Surgical intervention addressed a high-flow arteriovenous fistula involving the right vertebral artery and an epidural vein, necessitating sacrifice of the artery. Posterior fusion and laminectomy were performed, resulting in stable neurological status postoperatively and significant improvement in sensory loss and weakness at three months. This case underscores the importance of a tailored posterior-only approach, involving dural fold release, to allow the spinal cord to relocate to a less tense position, thus demonstrating effective decompression in complex NF1 cases with concurrent kyphotic deformity and vertebral artery AVF."

The mean age was 9.4 years (range 2 years-18 years). All patients had their visual acuity measured by a test according to age, were examined for the presence of lisch nodules and an Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) of the macular area was performed. All the OCT images were analysed to check if visible nodules could be identified. Ages 14 (95% CI=(9.7,18.3)) and 12 years (95% CI=(9.1,14)) are the cut-off points that best separate those with choroidal nodules with Triton OCT and lisch with slit lamp, respectively, from those without. lisch nodules were detected in 50% of cases of NF1 patients. The presence of choroidal nodules did not present a statistically significant correlation with the occurrence of optic pathway glioma (p = 0.96) nor with the patient's visual worsening (p = 0.072). A statistically significant correlation was observed between the presence of choroidal nodules and the presence of lisch nodules (p < 0.05). The Topcon Triton OCT red free tool would not be a good tool to detect choroidal nodules in patients with NF1 because of its low sensitivity. If the presence of choroidal nodules were to be included in the diagnostic criteria for NF1, it would be convenient to use a device with red and infrared radiations."

He also had recent-onset difficulty in breathing. Telelaryngoscopy and subsequent contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan revealed a well-defined, smooth submucosal mass in the oropharynx (attached to the posterior pharyngeal wall, superior to the level of left aryepiglottic fold), obscuring the ipsilateral pyriform fossa, and nearly blocking the pharyngeal lumen. The mass was removed with endoscopic coblation-assisted laryngeal surgery, and subsequent histopathology revealed it to be neurofibroma. Neurofibromas are rare neoplasms to be encountered in the oropharynx. However, in the setting of von Recklinghausen's disease (neurofibromatosis type 1), one or more well-demarcated, submucosal nodular lesions in the upper aerodigestive tract may be considered as neurofibromas, and workup and treatment should be directed accordingly based on this clinical presumption. Endoscopic coblation during laryngeal surgery can effectively be used as a surgical tool to excise such lesions. It provides a relatively bloodless field compared to the conventional cold steel excision, and reduces the risk of complications at surgery and during the follow-up period. This clinical record illustrates the presentation and management of a solitary, isolated oropharyngeal neurofibroma in a man suffering from von Recklinghausen's disease. It further emphasizes the role of endoscopic coblation-assisted laryngeal surgery in this setup, and the need to maintain a low threshold of suspicion in having a provisional clinical diagnosis of such lesions."

    "abstract": "RASopathies are a group of disorders characterized by pathogenic mutations in the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (Ras/MAPK) signaling pathway. Distinct pathogenic variants in genes encoding proteins in the Ras/MAPK pathway cause Noonan syndrome (NS) and neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), which are associated with increased risk for autism spectrum disorder and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. This study examined the effect of RASopathies (NS and NF1) on human neuroanatomy, specifically on surface area (SA), cortical thickness (CT), and subcortical volumes. Using vertex-based analysis for cortical measures and Desikan region of interest parcellation for subcortical volumes, we compared structural T1-weighted images of children with RASopathies (n = 91, mean age = 8.81 years, SD = 2.12) to those of sex- and age-matched typically developing children (n = 74, mean age = 9.07 years, SD = 1.77). Compared with typically developing children, RASopathies had convergent effects on SA and CT, exhibiting increased SA in the precentral gyrus, decreased SA in occipital regions, and thinner CT in the precentral gyrus. RASopathies exhibited divergent effects on subcortical volumes, with syndrome-specific influences from NS and NF1. Overall, children with NS showed decreased volumes in striatal and thalamic structures, and children with NF1 displayed increased volumes in the hippocampus, amygdala, and thalamus. Our study reveals the converging and diverging neuroanatomical effects of RASopathies on human neurodevelopment. The convergence of cortical effects on SA and CT indicates a shared influence of Ras/MAPK hyperactivation on the human brain. Therefore, considering these measures as objective outcome indicators for targeted treatments is imperative."

    "abstract": "With the recognition that noncancerous cells function as critical regulators of brain tumor growth, we recently demonstrated that neurons drive low-grade glioma initiation and progression. Using mouse models of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)-associated optic pathway glioma (OPG), we showed that Nf1 mutation induces neuronal hyperexcitability and midkine expression, which activates an immune axis to support tumor growth, such that high-dose lamotrigine treatment reduces Nf1-OPG proliferation. Herein, we execute a series of complementary experiments to address several key knowledge gaps relevant to future clinical translation. We leverage a collection of Nf1-mutant mice that spontaneously develop OPGs to alter both germline and retinal neuron-specific midkine expression. Nf1-mutant mice harboring several different NF1 patient-derived germline mutations were employed to evaluate neuronal excitability and midkine expression. Two distinct Nf1-OPG preclinical mouse models were used to assess lamotrigine effects on tumor progression and growth in vivo. We establish that neuronal midkine is both necessary and sufficient for Nf1-OPG growth, demonstrating an obligate relationship between germline Nf1 mutation, neuronal excitability, midkine production, and Nf1-OPG proliferation. We show anti-epileptic drug (lamotrigine) specificity in suppressing neuronal midkine production. Relevant to clinical translation, lamotrigine prevents Nf1-OPG progression and suppresses the growth of existing tumors for months following drug cessation. Importantly, lamotrigine abrogates tumor growth in two Nf1-OPG strains using pediatric epilepsy clinical dosing. Together, these findings establish midkine and neuronal hyperexcitability as targetable drivers of Nf1-OPG growth and support the use of lamotrigine as a potential chemoprevention or chemotherapy agent for children with NF1-OPG."

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by proliferation of cells from neural crest origin. The most common manifestations are cutaneous, neurologic, skeletal and ocular. The distinction of NF1 from other syndromes with multiple café-au-lait macules may be difficult in the pediatric age group, and ocular findings, especially Lisch nodules (i.e., melanocytic hamartomas on the irides), are a useful, early diagnostic tool. In recent years, novel ocular manifestations descriptively referred to as \"choroidal abnormalities\", choroidal \"hyperpigmented spots\" and \"retinal vascular abnormalities\" have been recognized in NF1. Choroidal abnormalities (CA) appear as bright patchy nodules that can be best detected with near-infrared ocular coherence tomography imaging (NIR-OCT). Because of their high specificity and sensitivity for NF1, CA have been added as an ocular diagnostic criterion of NF1 as an alternative to Lisch nodules. Although CA are important ocular diagnostic criteria for NF1, the histologic correlates are controversial. We present the postmortem ocular pathology findings of an NF1 patient for whom clinical notes and ocular imaging were available. Findings in this patient included choroidal hyperpigmented spots on funduscopy and retinal vascular abnormalities, both of which have been reported to be closely associated with CA. Histologic examination of the eyes showed multiple clusters of melanocytes of varying sizes in the choroid. Pathologic review of 12 additional postmortem eyes from 6 NF1 patients showed multiple, bilateral choroidal melanocytic aggregates in all eyes. These findings suggest that the CA seen on NIR-OCT and the hyperpigmented spots seen clinically in NF1 patients are manifestations of multifocal choroidal melanocytic clusters, consistent with choroidal melanocytic hamartomas. Lisch nodules, often multiple, were present in all eyes with morphology that differed from the choroidal hamartomas. As such, although CA and Lisch nodules are melanocytic hamartomas, there are clear phenotypical differences in their morphologies."

Herein, we report a case of multiple primary sporadic GISTs in a 64-year-old man, affecting the abdominal cavity and retroperitoneum, as identified through dual-time point positron emission tomography (PET) with <sup>18</sup>F-labeled fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (<sup>18</sup>F-FDG) and computed tomography (<sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/CT). Notably, the dual-time-point PET/CT revealed the migration of masses near the lower abdomen into the abdominal cavity. Furthermore, a significant increase in radioactive uptake of the mass 3 h after <sup>18</sup>F-FDG injection compared with that 1 h after injection may be an important cue for its diagnosis."

    "title": "Raman difference spectroscopy and U-Net convolutional neural network for molecular analysis of cutaneous neurofibroma.",
    "abstract": "In Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), peripheral nerve sheaths tumors are common, with cutaneous neurofibromas resulting in significant aesthetic, painful and functional problems requiring surgical removal. To date, determination of adequate surgical resection margins-complete tumor removal while attempting to preserve viable tissue-remains largely subjective. Thus, residual tumor extension beyond surgical margins or recurrence of the disease may frequently be observed. Here, we introduce Shifted-Excitation Raman Spectroscopy in combination with deep neural networks for the future perspective of objective, real-time diagnosis, and guided surgical ablation. The obtained results are validated through established histological methods. In this study, we evaluated the discrimination between cutaneous neurofibroma (n = 9) and adjacent physiological tissues (n = 25) in 34 surgical pathological specimens ex vivo at a total of 82 distinct measurement loci. Based on a convolutional neural network (U-Net), the mean raw Raman spectra (n = 8,200) were processed and refined, and afterwards the spectral peaks were assigned to their respective molecular origin. Principal component and linear discriminant analysis was used to discriminate cutaneous neurofibromas from physiological tissues with a sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 97.3%, and overall classification accuracy of 97.6%. The results enable the presented optical, non-invasive technique in combination with artificial intelligence as a promising candidate to ameliorate both, diagnosis and treatment of patients affected by cutaneous neurofibroma and NF1."

    "abstract": "Alterations of the <i>NF1</i> tumor suppressor gene is the second most frequent genetic event in embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (ERMS), but its associations with clinicopathologic features, outcome, or coexisting molecular events are not well defined. Additionally, <i>NF1</i> alterations, mostly in the setting of neurofibromatosis type I (NF1), drive the pathogenesis of most malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor with divergent RMS differentiation (also known as malignant triton tumor [MTT]). Distinguishing between these entities can be challenging because of their pathologic overlap. This study aims to comprehensively analyze the clinicopathologic and molecular spectrum of <i>NF1</i>-mutant RMS compared with NF1-associated MTT for a better understanding of their pathogenesis. We investigated the clinicopathologic and molecular landscape of a cohort of 22 <i>NF1</i>-mutant RMS and a control group of 13 <i>NF1</i>-associated MTT. Cases were tested on a matched tumor-normal hybridization capture-based targeted DNA next-generation sequencing. Among the RMS group, all except one were ERMS, with a median age of 17 years while for MTT the mean age was 39 years. Three MTTs were misdiagnosed as ERMS, having clinical impact in one. The most frequent coexisting alteration in ERMS was <i>TP53</i> abnormality (36%), being mutually exclusive from <i>NRAS</i> mutations (14%). MTT showed coexisting <i>CDKN2A/B</i> and PRC2 complex alterations in 38% cases and loss of H3K27me3 expression. Patients with <i>NF1</i>-mutant RMS exhibited a 70% 5-year survival rate, in contrast to MTT with a 33% 5-year survival. All metastatic <i>NF1</i>-mutant ERMS were associated with <i>TP53</i> alterations. Patients with NF1-mutant ERMS lacking <i>TP53</i> alterations may benefit from dose-reduction chemotherapy. On the basis of the diagnostic challenges and significant treatment and prognostic differences, molecular profiling of challenging tumors with rhabdomyoblastic differentiation is recommended."

    "title": "RASopathies for Radiologists.",
    "abstract": "RASopathies are a heterogeneous group of genetic syndromes caused by germline mutations in a group of genes that encode components or regulators of the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. RASopathies include neurofibromatosis type 1, Legius syndrome, Noonan syndrome, Costello syndrome, cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome, central conducting lymphatic anomaly, and capillary malformation-arteriovenous malformation syndrome. These disorders are grouped together as RASopathies based on our current understanding of the Ras/MAPK pathway. Abnormal activation of the Ras/MAPK pathway plays a major role in development of RASopathies. The individual disorders of RASopathies are rare, but collectively they are the most common genetic condition (one in 1000 newborns). Activation or dysregulation of the common Ras/MAPK pathway gives rise to overlapping clinical features of RASopathies, involving the cardiovascular, lymphatic, musculoskeletal, cutaneous, and central nervous systems. At the same time, there is much phenotypic variability in this group of disorders. Benign and malignant tumors are associated with certain disorders. Recently, many institutions have established multidisciplinary RASopathy clinics to address unique therapeutic challenges for patients with RASopathies. Medications developed for Ras/MAPK pathway-related cancer treatment may also control the clinical symptoms due to an abnormal Ras/MAPK pathway in RASopathies. Therefore, radiologists need to be aware of the concept of RASopathies to participate in multidisciplinary care. As with the clinical manifestations, imaging features of RASopathies are overlapping and at the same time diverse. As an introduction to the concept of RASopathies, the authors present major representative RASopathies, with emphasis on their imaging similarities and differences. <sup>©</sup>RSNA, 2024 Test Your Knowledge questions for this article are available in the supplemental material."

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant inherited tumor predisposition disease with a highly variable phenotype. The influence of the characteristic NF1 tumors (neurofibromas) on dentition has not yet been examined in detail. The aim of the study was to assess the dentition of NF1 children and adolescents, considering the symmetry of tooth development. The panoramic radiographs of 59 patients with a confirmed NF1 diagnosis were compared with 59 age-and-sex-matched controls. The stages of tooth development on the sides of the jaw, added to a score, were assessed. In addition, the number of filled or decayed teeth, and the number of retained or missing teeth were assessed. The tooth development of both study groups is symmetrical for almost all parameters and in the same developmental stage according to the sum score of the tooth development stages. Discrete developmental delays of teeth, in particular in the oral area of facial plexiform neurofibroma (PNF) are noticeable. NF1 patients' teeth showed less decay and more restorations than that of the control group. The facial PNF (FPNF) does not impair emergence of deciduous teeth. Development of dentition of NF1 patients does not differ from the general population. However, FPNF with oral tumor components often prevent mesial movement of permanent molars and premolars, so these teeth do not develop contact (spacing), hardly emerge or may stay retained in bone. Oral PNF may have a low-retarding effect on some tooth root development (e.g., wisdom teeth). This effect is negligible when comparing the affected and unaffected sides of the jaw and is probably non-specific. <b>Key words:</b>Neurofibromatosis type 1, plexiform neurofibroma, dentition, mixed dentition, symmetry, oral health, tooth development."

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant genetic condition with complete age-dependent penetrance, variable expressivity and a global prevalence of ∼1/3,000. It is characteriszed by numerous café-au-lait macules, skin freckling in the inguinal or axillary regions, Lisch nodules of the iris, optic gliomas, neurofibromas, and tumour predisposition. The diagnostic testing strategy for NF1 includes testing for DNA single nucleotide variants (SNVs), copy number variants (CNVs) as well as RNA analysis for deep intronic and splice variants, which can cumulatively identify the causative variant in 95% of patients. In the present study, NF1 patients were screened using a next-generation sequencing (NGS) assay targeting <i>NF1</i> exons and intron/exon boundaries for SNV and <i>NF1</i> multiple ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) analysis for CNV detection. Twenty-six unrelated Southern African patients clinically suspected of having NF1, based on the clinical diagnostic criteria developed by the National Institute of Health (NIH), were included in the current study. A detection rate of 58% (15/26) was obtained, with SNVs identified in 80% (12/15) using a targeted gene panel and <i>NF1</i> gene deletion in 20% (3/15) identified using MLPA. Ten patients (38%) had no variants identified, although they met NF1 diagnostic criteria. One VUS was identified in this study in a patient that met NF1 diagnostic criteria, however there was no sufficient information to classify variant as pathogenic. The clinical features of Southern African patients with NF1 are similar to that of the known NF1 phenotype, with the exception of a lower frequency of plexiform neurofibromas and a higher frequency of developmental/intellectual disability compared to other cohorts. This is the first clinical and molecular characterisation of a Southern African ancestry NF1 cohort using both next-generation sequencing and MLPA analysis. A significant number of patients remained without a diagnosis following DNA-level testing. The current study offers a potential molecular testing strategy for our low resource environment that could benefit a significant proportion of patients who previously only received a clinical diagnosis without molecular confirmation."

    "abstract": "Oncolytic adenoviruses (Ads) stand out as a promising strategy for the targeted infection and lysis of tumor cells, with well-established clinical utility across various malignancies. This study delves into the therapeutic potential of oncolytic Ads in the context of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)-associated malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs). Specifically, we evaluate conditionally replicative adenoviruses (CRAds) driven by the cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2) promoter, as selective agents against MPNSTs, demonstrating their preferential targeting of MPNST cells compared with non-malignant Schwann cell control. COX2-driven CRAds, particularly those with modified fiber-knobs exhibit superior binding affinity toward MPNST cells and demonstrate efficient and preferential replication and lysis of MPNST cells, with minimal impact on non-malignant control cells. <i>In vivo</i> experiments involving intratumoral CRAd injections in immunocompromised mice with human MPNST xenografts significantly extend survival and reduce tumor growth rate compared with controls. Moreover, in immunocompetent mouse models with MPNST-like allografts, CRAd injections induce a robust infiltration of CD8+ T cells into the tumor microenvironment (TME), indicating the potential to promote a pro-inflammatory response. These findings underscore oncolytic Ads as promising, selective, and minimally toxic agents for MPNST therapy, warranting further exploration."

    "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) is a genetic autosomal dominant disorder that affects both the central and peripheral nervous systems. Children and adolescents with NF1 commonly experience neuropsychological, motor, and behavioral deficits. The cognitive profile hallmark of this disorder includes visuospatial and executive function impairments. These cognitive disorders may persist into adulthood. This study aims to analyze previous research studies that have described cognitive dysfunctions in adults with NF1. The purpose of this analysis is to review the neuropsychological and psychological assessment methods used. <b>Methods:</b> A total of 327 articles were identified based on the search terms in their titles and abstracts. The evaluation was conducted by scrutinizing each article's title, abstract, and text. <b>Results:</b> Only 16 articles were found to be eligible for inclusion based on the pre-defined criteria. The selected studies primarily focus on the development of diagnostic protocols for individuals with NF1. <b>Conclusions:</b> The management of NF1 disease requires a multidisciplinary approach to address symptoms, preserve neurological functions, and ensure the best possible quality of life. However, cognitive impairment can negatively affect psychological well-being. This study suggested that cognitive functions in NF1 patients were not tested using specific measures, but rather were evaluated through intelligence scales. Additionally, the findings revealed that there is no standardized neuropsychological assessment for adults with NF1. To address this gap, it would be helpful to create a specific neuropsychological battery to study cognitive function in NF1 patients during clinical studies. This battery could also serve as a tool to design models for cognitive rehabilitation by using reliable and sensitive measures of cognitive outcomes."

This retrospective cohort study included patients with SVAS at our institution who had a negative evaluation for WS from May 1991 to September 2021. SVAS was defined as (1) peak supravalvar velocity of ≥2 meters/second, (2) sinotubular junction or ascending aortic <i>Z</i> score <-2.0, or (3) sinotubular junction <i>Z</i> score <-1.5 with family history of SVAS. Patients with complex congenital heart disease, aortic valve disease as the primary condition, or only postoperative SVAS were excluded. Genetic testing and diagnoses were reported. Of 162 patients who were WS negative meeting inclusion criteria, 61 had genetic testing results available (38%). Chromosomal microarray had been performed in 44 of 61 and was nondiagnostic for non-WS causes of SVAS. Sequencing of 1 or more genes was performed in 47 of 61. Of these, 39 of 47 underwent <i>ELN</i> sequencing, 20 of 39 (51%) of whom had a diagnostic variant.

    "abstract": "Selumetinib is clinically used for pediatric patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 and symptomatic, inoperable plexiform neurofibromas. Until recently, selumetinib had to be taken twice daily, after 2 hours of fasting and followed by 1 hour of fasting, which could be inconvenient. This population analysis evaluated the effect of low- and high-fat meals on the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of selumetinib and its active metabolite N-desmethyl selumetinib. The dataset comprised 511 subjects from 15 clinical trials who received ≥1 dose of selumetinib and provided ≥1 measurable postdose concentration of selumetinib and N-desmethyl selumetinib. A 2-compartment model with sequential 0- and 1st-order delayed absorption and 1st-order elimination adequately described selumetinib PK characteristics. A 1-compartment model reasonably described N-desmethyl selumetinib PK characteristics over time simultaneously with selumetinib. Selumetinib geometric mean area under the concentration-time curve ratio (1-sided 90% confidence interval [CI] lower bound) was 76.9% (73.3%) with a low-fat meal and 79.3% (76.3%) with a high-fat meal versus fasting. The lower bound of the 1-sided 90% CI demonstrated a difference of <30% between fed and fasted states.

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) is a common cancer predisposition syndrome, caused by heterozygous loss of function mutations in the tumor suppressor gene <i>NF1</i>. Individuals with NF1 develop benign tumors of the peripheral nervous system (neurofibromas), originating from the Schwann cell linage after somatic loss of the wild type <i>NF1</i> allele, some of which progress further to malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST). There is only one FDA approved targeted therapy for symptomatic plexiform neurofibromas and none approved for MPNST. The genetic basis of NF1 syndrome makes associated tumors ideal for using synthetic drug sensitivity approaches to uncover therapeutic vulnerabilities. We developed a drug discovery pipeline to identify therapeutics for NF1-related tumors using isogeneic pairs of <i>NF1-</i>proficient and deficient immortalized human Schwann cells. We utilized these in a large-scale high throughput screen (HTS) for drugs that preferentially kill <i>NF1</i>-deficient cells, through which we identified 23 compounds capable of killing <i>NF1-</i>deficient Schwann cells with selectivity. Multiple hits from this screen clustered into classes defined by method of action. Four clinically interesting drugs from these classes were tested <i>in vivo</i> using both a genetically engineered mouse model of high-grade peripheral nerve sheath tumors and human MPNST xenografts. All drugs tested showed single agent efficacy in these models as well as significant synergy when used in combination with the MEK inhibitor Selumetinib. This HTS platform yielded novel therapeutically relevant compounds for the treatment of NF1-associated tumors and can serve as a tool to rapidly evaluate new compounds and combinations in the future."

Epithelioid sarcoma (ES) is an exceptionally rare subtype of soft-tissue sarcoma, with limited knowledge about its clinical presentation and optimal management in NF1. This report aims to provide insights into the characteristics and outcomes of ES in NF1 patients. A 37-year-old man with a history of NF1 presented with a progressively worsening mass on his right inner thigh. An MRI scan revealed a well-defined tissue mass originating from the adductor magnus muscle, later confirmed as ES through histopathology and immunohistochemistry. Considering poor local and general prognosis, the multidisciplinary team recommended salvage hip disarticulation, however the patient refused and opted for palliative marginal resection to reduce the tumour size. The patient's condition declined rapidly, and he succumbed six days after the surgery. This case highlights the rarity of ES in NF1 patients and underscores the potential for malignant tumour development in this population. Further research is needed to improve our understanding and management of sarcomas in the context of NF1. Patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 or von Recklinghausen's disease have a higher risk than those with other types of neurofibromatosis of developing benign or malignant soft-tissue tumours especially related to the nervous system.Epithelioid sarcoma is an extremely rare subtype of soft-tissue sarcoma and is exceptionally associated with neurofibromatosis type 1.A multidisciplinary approach remains essential in the diagnosis, management, and treatment of soft-tissue sarcomas in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1."

    "abstract": "RASopathies are associated with an increased risk of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). For neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) there is ample evidence for this increased risk, while for other RASopathies this association has been studied less. No specific ASD profile has been delineated so far for RASopathies or a specific RASopathy individually. We conducted a systematic review to investigate whether a specific RASopathy is associated with a specific ASD profile, or if RASopathies altogether have a distinct ASD profile compared to idiopathic ASD (iASD). We searched PubMed, Web of Science, and Open Grey for data about ASD features in RASopathies and potential modifiers. We included 41 articles on ASD features in NF1, Noonan syndrome (NS), Costello syndrome (CS), and cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome (CFC). Individuals with NF1, NS, CS, and CFC on average have higher ASD symptomatology than healthy controls and unaffected siblings, though less than people with iASD. There is insufficient evidence for a distinct ASD phenotype in RASopathies compared to iASD or when RASopathies are compared with each other. We identified several potentially modifying factors of ASD symptoms in RASopathies. Our systematic review found no convincing evidence for a specific ASD profile in RASopathies compared to iASD, or in a specific RASopathy compared to other RASopathies. However, we identified important limitations in the research literature which may also account for this result. These limitations are discussed and recommendations for future research are formulated."

The incidence of germline predisposition among children with brain tumors continues to grow as our knowledge on disease etiology increases. Some children with brain tumors may present with nonmalignant phenotypic features of specific syndromes (e.g., nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome, neurofibromatosis type 1 and type 2, DICER1 syndrome, and constitutional mismatch-repair deficiency), while others may present with a strong family history of cancer (e.g., Li-Fraumeni syndrome) or with a rare tumor commonly found in the context of germline predisposition (e.g., rhabdoid tumor predisposition syndrome). Approximately 50% of patients with a brain tumor may be the first in a family identified to have a predisposition. The past decade has witnessed a rapid expansion in our molecular understanding of CNS tumors. A significant proportion of CNS tumors are now well characterized and known to harbor specific genetic changes that can be found in the germline. Additional novel predisposition syndromes are also being described. Identification of these germline syndromes in individual patients has not only enabled cascade testing of family members and early tumor surveillance but also increasingly affected cancer management in those patients. Therefore, the AACR Cancer Predisposition Working Group chose to highlight these advances in CNS tumor predisposition and summarize and/or generate surveillance recommendations for established and more recently emerging pediatric brain tumor predisposition syndromes."

Between 1993 and 2023 a total of 26 patients at UCLA were found to have a SEDAVF. The median age at treatment was 59 years (range 4 months to 91 years). Compared with sacral, lumbar, and thoracic SEDAVFs, patients with cervical SEDAVF were younger (41 years vs 63 years, P=0.016) and more likely to be female (66.7% vs 14.3%, P=0.006). Possible triggers for development of SEDAVFs may be prior spinal surgery or trauma (n=4), turning the neck (n=1), lifting a heavy box (n=1), a prolonged period of bending over (n=1), and neurofibromatosis type 1 (n=1).

Prevalence of endocrine and non-endocrine health problems between NF1 adults with and without fatigue. In our cohort, 75% of NF1 adults experienced fatigue. The most frequent endocrine disorders were vitamin D deficiency (28%), obesity (18%) and hypothyroidism (8%). The most frequent non-endocrine internal disorder was high blood pressure (42%). None of the disorders differed significantly between adults with and without fatigue. Endocrine and non-endocrine disorders were equally present in our cohort of NF1 adults with and without fatigue. This suggests that the high prevalence of fatigue in NF1 adults is not explained by these somatic disorders. An alternative explanation for fatigue might be deficits in cognitive functioning and other neuropsychological processes in NF1.

In this cohort study, we collected cross-sectional and longitudinal data on all patients with CMMRD, with no age limits, registered with the International Replication Repair Deficiency Consortium (IRRDC) across more than 50 countries. Clinical data were extracted from the IRRDC database, medical records, and physician-completed case record forms. The primary objective was to describe the clinical features, cancer spectrum, and biology of the condition. Secondary objectives included estimations of cancer incidence and of the impact of the specific mismatch-repair gene and genotype on cancer onset and survival, including after cancer surveillance and immunotherapy interventions. We analysed data from 201 patients (103 males, 98 females) enrolled between June 5, 2007 and Sept 9, 2022. Median age at diagnosis of CMMRD or a related cancer was 8·9 years (IQR 5·9-12·6), and median follow-up from diagnosis was 7·2 years (3·6-14·8). Endogamy among minorities and closed communities contributed to high homozygosity within countries with low consanguinity. Frequent dermatological manifestations (117 [93%] of 126 patients with complete data) led to a clinical overlap with neurofibromatosis type 1 (35 [28%] of 126). 339 cancers were reported in 194 (97%) of 201 patients. The cumulative cancer incidence by age 18 years was 90% (95% CI 80-99). Median time between cancer diagnoses for patients with more than one cancer was 1·9 years (IQR 0·8-3·9). Neoplasms developed in 15 organs and included early-onset adult cancers. CNS tumours were the most frequent (173 [51%] cancers), followed by gastrointestinal (75 [22%]), haematological (61 [18%]), and other cancer types (30 [9%]). Patients with CNS tumours had the poorest overall survival rates (39% [95% CI 30-52] at 10 years from diagnosis; log-rank p<0·0001 across four cancer types), followed by those with haematological cancers (67% [55-82]), gastrointestinal cancers (89% [81-97]), and other solid tumours (96% [88-100]). All cancers showed high mutation and microsatellite indel burdens, and pathognomonic mutational signatures. MLH1 or MSH2 variants caused earlier cancer onset than PMS2 or MSH6 variants, and inferior survival (overall survival at age 15 years 63% [95% CI 55-73] for PMS2, 49% [35-68] for MSH6, 19% [6-66] for MLH1, and 0% for MSH2; p<0·0001). Frameshift or truncating variants within the same gene caused earlier cancers and inferior outcomes compared with missense variants (p<0·0001). The greater deleterious effects of MLH1 and MSH2 variants as compared with PMS2 and MSH6 variants persisted despite overall improvements in survival after surveillance or immune checkpoint inhibitor interventions. The very high cancer burden and unique genomic landscape of CMMRD highlight the benefit of comprehensive assays in timely diagnosis and precision approaches toward surveillance and immunotherapy. These data will guide the clinical management of children and patients who survive into adulthood with CMMRD.

    "abstract": "Perivascular epithelioid cell tumors (PEComas) are rare mesenchymal tumors of uncertain histogenesis expressing smooth muscle and melanocytic markers. The clinicopathologic spectrum in young patients is not well documented. To describe a multi-institutional series of PEComas in children, adolescents, and young adults. PEComas, not otherwise specified (NOS); angiomyolipomas (AMLs); lymphangioleiomyomatosis; and clear cell sugar tumors were retrospectively identified from 6 institutions and the authors' files. Seventy PEComas in 64 patients (median age, 15 years) were identified. They were more common in females (45 of 64 patients), occurring predominantly in the kidney (53 of 70), followed by the liver (6 of 70). Thirty-four patients had confirmed tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), 3 suspected TSC mosaicism, 2 Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) and 1 neurofibromatosis type 1. Most common variants were classic (49 of 70) and epithelioid (8 of 70) AML. Among patients with AMLs, most (34 of 47) had TSC, and more TSC patients had multiple AMLs (15 of 36) than non-TSC patients (2 of 13). Two TSC patients developed malignant transformation of classic AMLs: 1 angiosarcomatous and 1 malignant epithelioid. Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (5 of 70) occurred in females only, usually in the TSC context (4 of 5). PEComas-NOS (6 of 70) occurred exclusively in non-TSC patients, 2 of whom had LFS (2 of 6). Three were malignant, 1 had uncertain malignant potential, and 2 were benign. All 4 PEComas-NOS in non-LFS patients had TFE3 rearrangements. Compared to the general population, TSC was more prevalent in our cohort; PEComas-NOS showed more frequent TFE3 rearrangements and possible association with LFS. This series expands the spectrum of PEComas in young patients and demonstrates molecular features and germline contexts that set them apart from older patients."

    "title": "Silver Nanoparticles Selectively Treat Neurofibromatosis Type 1-Associated Plexiform Neurofibroma Cells at Doses That Do Not Affect Patient-Matched Schwann Cells.",
    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) is a common neurogenic condition characterized by heterozygous loss of function mutations in the neurofibromin gene. NF1 patients are susceptible to the development of neurofibromas, including plexiform neurofibromas (pNFs), which occurs in about half of all cases. Plexiform neurofibroma are benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors originating from Schwann cells after complete loss of neurofibromin; they can be debilitating and also transform into deadly malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs). Here, our data indicates that silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) may be useful in the treatment of pNFs. We assessed the cytotoxicity of AgNPs using pNF cells and Schwann cells derived from the same NF1 patient. We found that AgNPs are selectively cytotoxic to pNF cells relative to isogenic Schwann cells. We then examined the role of neurofibromin expression on AgNP-mediated cytotoxicity; restoration of neurofibromin expression in pNF cells decreased sensitivity to AgNP, and knockdown of neurofibromin in isogenic Schwann cells increased sensitivity to AgNP, outlining a correlation between neurofibromin expression and AgNP-mediated cytotoxicity. AgNP was able to selectively remove pNF cells from a co-culture with patient-matched Schwann cells. Therefore, AgNPs represent a new approach for clinical management of NF1-associated pNF to address significant clinical need."

    "abstract": "<b>Background</b>: Plexiform neurofibromas (pNFs) are benign neoplasms, primarily originating from Schwann cells, posing challenges in patients with type 1 neurofibromatosis (NF1) due to pain, disfigurement, compression of vital structures and potential for malignancy. Selumetinib, a MEK1/2 inhibitor, has shown promising results in treating inoperable pNFs, with clinical trials demonstrating tumor volume reduction and improved patient-reported outcomes. Despite its efficacy, dermatologic toxicities may impact the quality of life and treatment adherence. Evaluating the frequency and spectrum of such effects is crucial for effective management. <b>Methods</b>: In a four-year retrospective and prospective study, pediatric NF1 patients with symptomatic, inoperable plexiform neurofibromas (pNFs) were treated with selumetinib. Eligibility criteria included significant morbidity, pNF size exceeding 3 cm or surgical inoperability, and performance status >70%. Hematological, liver, lung and cardiac assessments established baseline health. Selumetinib, orally administered at 25 mg/m<sup>2</sup> twice, was administered for two years unless a response warranting extension occurred. Cutaneous AEs were documented and graded by severity according to CTCAE v5.0, with evaluations every three to six months. The impact on symptoms and pNF size was systematically recorded, and biopsies characterized histopathological features in those patients requiring surgery. <b>Results</b>: Twenty patients were enrolled, with an average age at therapy initiation of 11.6 years. Cutaneous side effects were common, with all patients experiencing at least one and a median of two per patient. Xerosis, paronychia and acneiform rash were prevalent. Notably, pre-pubertal individuals were more susceptible to xerosis. Acneiform rash had a higher incidence in older patients and those with skin phototypes II and III. Successful management involved tailored approaches, such as clindamycin for acneiform rash and topical agents for paronychia. Hair abnormalities, including color changes and thinning, occurred, with female patients at higher risk for the latter. Paronychia presented challenges, necessitating various interventions, including surgical approaches. AEs led to treatment suspension in 20% of patients, with tumor rebound observed in 75%. <b>Conclusions</b>: According to our experience, successful management of selumetinib-induced cutaneous AEs requires tailored strategies including surgery. AEs might indirectly determine pNF regrowth due to therapy suspension. We thus emphasize the pivotal role of addressing cutaneous reactions for effective selumetinib management in pediatric patients."

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis Type 1 is an autosomal dominant tumour-predisposition condition commonly diagnosed in childhood and fully penetrant by adulthood. Long-term monitoring through imaging is inconsistent and varies between high- and low-income countries. Implementation of a clinical practice guideline through a multidisciplinary clinic is instrumental to the care of adult Neurofibromatosis Type 1 patients. We aim to systematically review international diagnostic modalities and strategies to evaluate any association between a country's socioeconomic status and diagnostic modalities or strategies used for Neurofibromatosis Type 1 patients. We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane. Relevant clinical information on the surveillance of adult Neurofibromatosis Type 1 patients worldwide was reviewed, extracted, and synthesised. We identified 51 papers reporting on 7724 individuals. Multiple imaging modalities are actively employed in high-income and upper-middle-income countries for surveying adult Neurofibromatosis Type 1 patients. We did not find any relevant papers from low- and middle-income countries. This systematic review suggests that there is robust data on diagnostic modalities for adult Neurofibromatosis Type 1 patients in high-income countries, but not for low- and middle-income countries. There is a lack of data on consolidated diagnostic strategies from both high- and low-income countries. Efforts should be made to publish data on usual clinical practice in low- and middle-income countries to develop clinical practice guidelines describing best medical practice to fit a local context."

    "abstract": "This article reviews the pathology and management of peripheral nerve tumours, including a framework for investigation and decision-making. Most tumours are benign, including schwannomas and neurofibromas, but malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours can occur. The risk of malignant change is remote for schwannomas but higher for neurofibromas, particularly in neurofibromatosis type 1. Magnetic resonance imaging is useful for defining the relationship of a swelling with adjacent nerves but is not definitive for tissue diagnosis. Increasing size, pain and neurological deficit suggest malignant change and TruCut needle biopsy is indicated, although there is a risk of sampling error. Excision biopsy preserving nerve function may be carried out for benign tumours to relieve symptoms. Malignant tumours require a multidisciplinary approach. Complete surgical excision with clear margins is the only curative treatment and may be supplemented with radiotherapy and chemotherapy. However, prognosis remains poor, particularly for patients with neurofibromatosis."

    "abstract": "The aim of this manuscript was to assess the epidemiology and clinical features of Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1) based on the newly published revised NF-1 diagnostic criteria and to evaluate complications of NF-1 including neurodevelopmental disorders. A retrospective cross-sectional observational study was conducted in the Ministry of National Guard Health Affairs (MNGHA) healthcare organization branches including four tertiary hospitals and 51 primary health care centers in different regions in Saudi Arabia. This study included all patients diagnosed with NF1 using the revised NIH diagnostic criteria published in 2021 that were registered at the electronic medical records (EMR) from 2015 to 2021. A total of 184 patients fulfilled the diagnostic criteria and were included in this study. The median age at diagnosis was 11 years (IQR: 4.00-20.25). The most encountered diagnostic criteria in this study were Café-au-lait macules (85.3%), and (42.9%) were found to have two or more neurofibromas with plexiform neurofibroma being the most common subtype (23.36%), approximately (36.4%) of the patient with optic pathway glioma. Nearby (26.6%) of the patients displayed different type of tumors. Iris Lisch nodules were presented in 36.4% of patients at a median age of 12 years (IQR: 9.0-21.8). Cardiovascular abnormality was encountered in 9.8% of the patients. Around 27.7% of the patients reported headache and 11.4% of the patient suffered from different type of epilepsy. Besides, 10.5% of the patients had intellectual disability, 33.8% suffered from communication disorders, and 4.9% patients had ADHD. The results of this study will enable practitioners to adopt a more holistic approach and prioritize numerous attributes, which they can subsequently incorporate into their therapeutic methodologies. Furthermore, the identification of these attributes will facilitate an expeditious and accurate diagnosis. Hence, the implementation of intervention during its nascent phase may result in a more advantageous consequence."

    "abstract": "There are many surgical approaches for execution of a thoracic corpectomy. In cases of challenging deformity, traditional posterior approaches might not be sufficient to complete the resection of the vertebral body. In this technical note, we describe indications and technique for a transdural multilevel high thoracic corpectomy. A 25-year-old man with a history of neurofibromatosis type 1 presented with instrumentation failure after a previous T1-T12 posterior spinal fusion, extensive laminectomy, and tumor resection. The patient presented with progressive back pain, had broad dural ectasia, and a progressive kyphotic rotational and anteriorly translated spinal deformity. To resect the medial-most aspect of the vertebral body, a bilateral extracavitary approach was attempted, but was found insufficient. A transdural approach was subsequently performed. A left paramedian durotomy was made, followed by generous arachnoid dissection, bilateral dentate ligament division, and T4 rootlet sacrifice to mobilize the spinal cord. A ventral durotomy was then made and the ventral dura was reflected over the spinal cord to protect it while drilling. The corpectomy was then completed. The ventral and dorsal durotomies were closed primarily and reinforced with fibrin glue and fibrin sealant patch. The corpectomy defect was filled with nonstructural autograft. The focal kyphosis was corrected with a combination of rod contouring, compression, and in situ bending. During the surgery, the patient had stable neuromonitoring data, and postoperatively had no neurological deficits. On follow-up until 1 year, the patient presented with no signs of cerebrospinal spinal leaks, no motor or sensory deficits, minimal incisional pain, and significantly improved posture. Complex high thoracic (T3-5) ventral pathology inaccessible via a bilateral extracavitary approach may be accessed via a transdural approach as opposed to an anterior/lateral transthoracic approach that requires mobilization of cardiovascular structures or scapula."

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF 1) is an autosomal-dominant tumor predisposition genetic disease affecting approximately 1 in 3000 live births. The condition could present various manifestations ranging from skin abnormalities to neurological tumors. The musculoskeletal system could also be frequently affected, and scoliosis is the most common orthopedic manifestation. Characterized by the early-onset and rapid progression tendency, NF 1-related dystrophic scoliosis presented discrepancies from idiopathic scoliosis in terms of natural history, clinical features, and management outcomes and thus required special attention. In the current study, the authors conducted a systemic review to outline the body of evidence of the natural history, clinical characteristics, surgical outcomes, and surgical complications of NF 1-induced scoliosis, aiming to provide an elucidative insight into this condition. Systemic review and meta-analysis were conducted according to the latest Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The search was performed in Medline, Embase, and Web of Science Core Collection up to December 27, 2022, using related keywords. Clinical features such as frequencies, segmental involvement, and hereditary information were summarized and described qualitatively. Meta-analysis was conducted using R software and the 'meta' package to yield an overall outcome of efficacy and safety of surgical management, precisely, spinal fusion procedure and growing rods procedure. Corrective rate of Cobb angle, sagittal kyphosis angle, and T1-S1 length post-operative and at the last follow-up was used to evaluate the efficacy, and the occurrence of surgery-related complications was used to evaluate the safety. A total of 37 articles involving 1023 patients were included. Approximately 26.6% of the NF 1 patients would present with scoliosis. Patients tend to develop scoliosis at an earlier age. The thoracic part turned out to be the most affected segment. No obvious correlation between scoliosis and genotype or hereditary type was observed. Both spinal fusion and growing rod surgery have shown acceptable treatment outcomes, with spinal fusion demonstrating better performance in terms of effectiveness and safety. The growing rods technique seemed to allow a better lengthening of the spine. The mainstay post-operative complications were implant-related complications but could be managed with limited revision surgery. Severe neurological deficits were rarely reported. Scoliosis, especially the subtype characterized by dystrophic bony changes, is a significant orthopedic manifestation of NF1. It has an early onset, a tendency to persistently and rapidly progress, and is challenging to deal with. The current review outlines the available evidence from the perspective of natural history, clinical features, and the treatment efficacy and safety of the mainstay surgical options. Patients with NF1 scoliosis will benefit from a better understanding of the disease and evidence based treatment strategies."

    "abstract": "Fibromuscular dysplasia is the most common cause of renovascular hypertension in young adults under 40 years old. It is potentially amenable to renal artery angioplasty, which frequently normalizes blood pressure. However, limited options exist if angioplasty is not technically possible, or restenosis occurs. Here, we describe 2 patients who presented with hypertension secondary to renal artery stenosis. In the first case, a young adult with hypertension secondary to renal artery stenosis (fibromuscular dysplasia), developed restenosis 11 weeks after an initially successful renal artery angioplasty. In the second case, a patient with neurofibromatosis type 1 was diagnosed with hypertension secondary to renal artery stenosis. Angioplasty was not possible due to multiple branch occlusions. Both individuals went on to have successful renal autotransplantations, which ultimately cured their hypertension. In this article, we review the background, indications, and blood pressure outcomes in relation to renal autotransplantation in nonatherosclerotic renal artery stenosis."

Original articles reporting on the efficacy and safety of elumetinib in patients with NF1 were comprehensively searched in the Pubmed database, Embase database, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science database and screened for inclusion of studies that met the criteria. We pooled the objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), disease progression rate (DPR), and the rate of improvement in PN-related complications using meta-analysis. The incidence of drug-related adverse events was also statistically analyzed. This study included 10 clinical trials involving 268 patients. The pooled ORR was 68.0% (95% CI 58.0-77.3%), the DCR was 96.8% (95% CI 90.8-99.7%) and the DPR was only 1.4% (95% CI 0-4.3%). The pooled improvement rate was 75.3% (95% CI 56.2-90.9%) for pain and 77.8% (95% CI 63.1-92.5%) for motor disorders. Most adverse events were mild, with the most common being gastrointestinal reactions (diarrhea: 62.5%; vomiting: 54.5%). Our study demonstrates that selumetinib is effective in patients with NF1 and PN, significantly improving the serious complications associated with PN as well as having tolerable toxicities. Our findings help to increase clinicians' confidence in applying selumetinib and promote the clinical adoption and benefit of the new drug."

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is caused by mutations in the NF1 gene that encodes neurofibromin, a RAS GTPase-activating protein. Inactivating NF1 mutations cause hyperactivation of RAS-mediated signaling, resulting in the development of multiple neoplasms, including malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs). MPNSTs are an aggressive tumor and the main cause of mortality in patients with NF1. MPNSTs are difficult to resect and refractory to chemo- and radiotherapy, and no molecular therapies currently exist. Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) is an approach to treat inoperable, undruggable cancers like MPNST, but successful outcomes require an immune cell-rich tumor microenvironment. While MPNSTs are noninflamed \"cold\" tumors, here, we converted MPNSTs into T cell-inflamed \"hot\" tumors by activating stimulator of IFN genes (STING) signaling. Mouse genetic and human xenograft MPNST models treated with a STING agonist plus ICB exhibited growth delay via increased apoptotic cell death. This strategy offers a potential treatment regimen for MPNSTs."

The PlexiQoL questionnaire is a disease-specific QoL measure for adults with NF1-associated plexiform neurofibromas. The aim of this study was to adapt and validate a Dutch version of the PlexiQoL for the Netherlands. The PlexiQoL was translated using the dual-panel methodology, followed by cognitive debriefing interviews to assess face and content validity. The psychometric properties were evaluated by administering the questionnaire on two separate occasions to a sample of adults with NF1 and plexiform neurofibromas. Feasibility was evaluated by the presence of floor/ceiling effects. Reliability was assessed by evaluating Cronbach's alpha coefficient and test-retest reliability, using Spearman's rank correlation coefficients. Mann-Whitney U tests were used to check for known group validity. The Nottingham Health Profile (NHP) questionnaire was used as comparator questionnaire to evaluate convergent validity. The translation and cognitive debriefing interviews resulted in a Dutch version of the PlexiQoL that reflected the original concept and underlying semantic meanings of the UK English version. Forty participants completed the validation survey. The Dutch PlexiQoL demonstrated excellent internal consistency (Cronbach's α 0.825) and test-retest reliability (Spearman correlation coefficient 0.928). The questionnaire detected differences in PlexiQoL scores between participants based on self-reported general health and disease severity. Convergent validity was confirmed for relevant NHP subsections. The Dutch PlexiQoL demonstrated excellent psychometric properties and can be reliably used to measure plexiform neurofibroma-related QoL in adults with NF1 in the Netherlands."

This study assessed the influence of sociodemographic factors and clinical features of the disease on the quality of life of Brazilian individuals with NF1. This is a descriptive cross-sectional study. Data were collected from 101 individuals with NF1 using the Brazilian version of the Impact of NF1 on Quality of Life Questionnaire (INF1-QoL), a form with information on sociodemographic characteristics, and an NF1 visibility self-evaluation scale. The relationship between variables was evaluated through statistical testing, and the significance level was defined as 0.05. The study included 101 adults with NF1 aged 18 to 59 years, with a mean age of 35.54 years (±9.63) and a female predominance (n = 84, 83.17%). The mean total INF1-QoL score was 10.62 (±5.63), with a median of 10, minimum value of 0, and maximum of 31 points. Two characteristics of the participants were significantly associated with the quality of life: educational level (p = 0.003) and familial history of NF1 (p = 0.019). There was a statistically significant correlation between the INF1-QoL score and the degree of disease visibility (rho = 0.218; p = 0.028). Cross-sectional study, conducted with a convenience sample and using self-reported measures. The findings support the significant impact of NF1 on quality of life. The authors recommend multidisciplinary follow-up for patients, with adherence to anticipatory clinical care measures, adequate pain control, psychological assistance, and genetic counseling."

Patient underwent a transcatheter angiographic embolization with subsequent video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) for a retained hemothorax. Patient was discharged home on Hospital Day 5, and follow-up imaging demonstrated a complete resolution of the hemothorax. This presented case contributes to literature by demonstrating intra-arterial embolization as a viable option to obtain hemostasis in fragile vessels. However, this may not always result in hemostasis, and VATS should be considered to achieve and ensure complete hemostasis."

    "abstract": "High-grade astrocytoma with piloid features (HGAP) is a recently identified brain tumor characterized by a distinct DNA methylation profile. Predominantly located in the posterior fossa of adults, HGAP is notably prevalent in individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1. We present an image-centric review of HGAP and explore the association between HGAP and neurofibromatosis type 1. Data were collected from 8 HGAP patients treated at two tertiary care institutions between January 2020 and October 2023. Demographic details, clinical records, management, and tumor molecular profiles were analyzed. Tumor characteristics, including location and imaging features on MR imaging, were reviewed. Clinical or imaging features suggestive of neurofibromatosis 1 or the presence of <i>NF1</i> gene alteration were documented. The mean age at presentation was 45.5 years (male/female = 5:3). Tumors were midline, localized in the posterior fossa (<i>n</i> = 4), diencephalic/thalamic (<i>n</i> = 2), and spinal cord (<i>n</i> = 2). HGAP lesions were T1 hypointense, T2-hyperintense, mostly without diffusion restriction, predominantly peripheral irregular enhancement with central necrosis (<i>n</i> = 3) followed by mixed heterogeneous enhancement (<i>n</i> = 2). Two <i>NF1</i> mutation carriers showed signs of neurofibromatosis type 1 before HGAP diagnosis, with one diagnosed during HGAP evaluation, strengthening the HGAP-<i>NF1</i> link, particularly in patients with posterior fossa masses. All tumors were <i>IDH1</i> wild-type, often with <i>ATRX</i>, <i>CDKN2A/B, and NF1</i> gene alteration. Six patients underwent surgical resection followed by adjuvant chemoradiation. Six patients were alive, and two died during the last follow-up. Histone H3 mutations were not detected in our cohort, such as the common H3K27M typically seen in diffuse midline gliomas, linked to aggressive clinical behavior and poor prognosis. HGAP lesions may involve the brain or spine and tend to be midline or paramedian in location. Underlying neurofibromatosis type 1 diagnosis or imaging findings are important diagnostic cues."

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is one of the most common genetic disorders caused by heterozygous germline <i>NF1</i> mutations. NF1 affects many systems, including the skeletal system. To date, no curative therapies are available for skeletal manifestations such as scoliosis and tibial dysplasia, mainly due to the lack of knowledge about the mechanisms that underlie this process. By using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing in human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) to minimize the variability due to genetic background and epigenetic factors, we generated isogenic heterozygous and homozygous <i>NF1</i>-deficient hiPSC lines to investigate the consequences of neurofibromin inactivation on osteoblastic differentiation. Here, we demonstrate that loss of one or both copies of <i>NF1</i> does not alter the potential of isogenic hiPSCs to differentiate into mesenchymal stem cells (hiPSC-MSCs). However, <i>NF1</i> (+/-) and <i>NF1</i> (-/-) hiPSC-MSCs show a defect in osteogenic differentiation and mineralization. In addition, we show that a mono-allelic deletion in <i>NF1</i> in an isogenic context is sufficient to impair cell differentiation into osteoblasts. Overall<b>,</b> this study highlights the relevance of generating isogenic lines, which may help in genotype-phenotype correlation and provide a human cellular model to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying NF1 and, thus, discover new therapeutic strategies."

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 is an autosomal-dominant disease characterized by café-au-lait spots and neurofibromas, as well as various other symptoms in the bones, eyes, and nervous system. Due to its connection with vascular fragility, neurofibromatosis type 1 has been reported to be associated with vascular lesions, such as aneurysms. However, there have been few reports of abdominal visceral aneurysms associated with neurofibromatosis type 1. Furthermore, there have been no reports of robotic treatment of aneurysms associated with neurofibromatosis type 1. In this report, we describe the case of a patient with neurofibromatosis type 1 with a splenic artery aneurysm who was successfully treated with robotic surgery. This report describes a 41-year-old Asian woman with a history of neurofibromatosis type 1 who was referred to our hospital for evaluation of a 28 mm splenic artery aneurysm observed on abdominal ultrasound. The aneurysm was in the splenic hilum, and transcatheter arterial embolization was attempted; however, this was difficult due to the tortuosity of the splenic artery. Thus, we suggested minimally invasive robotic surgery for treatment and resection of the splenic artery aneurysm with preservation of the spleen. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient was discharged on the eighth day after surgery. At 1 year of follow-up, the patient was doing well, with no evidence of recurrence. We encountered a rare case of splenic artery aneurysm in a patient with neurofibromatosis type 1 who was successfully treated with robotic surgery. There is no consensus on treatment modalities for neurofibromatosis-related aneurysms, and endovascular treatment is considered safe and effective; however, surgery remains an important treatment modality. Especially in patients with stable hemodynamic status, robotic surgery may be considered as definitive treatment. To our knowledge, this is the first successfully treated case of a splenic artery aneurysm in a patient with neurofibromatosis type 1."

    "abstract": "Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are chemotherapy resistant sarcomas that are a leading cause of death in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Although NF1-related MPNSTs derive from neural crest cell origin, they also exhibit intratumoral heterogeneity. TP53 mutations are associated with significantly decreased survival in MPNSTs, however the mechanisms underlying TP53-mediated therapy responses are unclear in the context of NF1-deficiency. We evaluated the role of two commonly altered genes, MET and TP53, in kinome reprograming and cellular differentiation in preclinical MPNST mouse models. We previously showed that MET amplification occurs early in human MPNST progression and that Trp53 loss abrogated MET-addiction resulting in MET inhibitor resistance. Here we demonstrate a novel mechanism of therapy resistance whereby p53 alters MET stability, localization, and downstream signaling leading to kinome reprogramming and lineage plasticity. Trp53 loss also resulted in a shift from RAS/ERK to AKT signaling and enhanced sensitivity to MEK and mTOR inhibition. In response to MET, MEK and mTOR inhibition, we observed broad and heterogeneous activation of key differentiation genes in Trp53-deficient lines suggesting Trp53 loss also impacts lineage plasticity in MPNSTs. These results demonstrate the mechanisms by which p53 loss alters MET dependency and therapy resistance in MPNSTS through kinome reprogramming and phenotypic flexibility."

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common genetic disorder resulting in the development of both benign and malignant tumors of the peripheral nervous system. NF1 is caused by germline pathogenic variants or deletions of the <i>NF1</i> tumor suppressor gene, which encodes the protein neurofibromin that functions as negative regulator of p21 RAS. Loss of <i>NF1</i> heterozygosity in Schwann cells (SCs), the cells of origin for these nerve sheath-derived tumors, leads to the formation of plexiform neurofibromas (PNF)-benign yet complex neoplasms involving multiple nerve fascicles and comprised of a myriad of infiltrating stromal and immune cells. PNF development and progression are shaped by dynamic interactions between SCs and immune cells, including mast cells, macrophages, and T cells. In this review, we explore the current state of the field and critical knowledge gaps regarding the role of <i>NF1(Nf1)</i> haploinsufficiency on immune cell function, as well as the putative impact of Schwann cell lineage states on immune cell recruitment and function within the tumor field. Furthermore, we review emerging evidence suggesting a dueling role of <i>Nf1+/-</i> immune cells along the neurofibroma to MPNST continuum, on one hand propitiating PNF initiation, while on the other, potentially impeding the malignant transformation of plexiform and atypical neurofibroma precursor lesions. Finally, we underscore the potential implications of these discoveries and advocate for further research directed at illuminating the contributions of various immune cells subsets in discrete stages of tumor initiation, progression, and malignant transformation to facilitate the discovery and translation of innovative diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to transform risk-adapted care."

    "abstract": "Studies have shown an increased risk of epilepsy in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). However, most reports focus on the pediatric population. In this study, we describe the trajectory of patients with NF1 and epilepsy beyond childhood. Patients with NF1 ≥18 years-old consecutively seen at a multidisciplinary neurofibromatosis clinic during a four-year period were prospectively enrolled and offered routine EEG, MRI, and genetic testing. The lifelong and point prevalence of epilepsy in patients with NF1 were calculated. Demographic, genetic, radiological, and clinical features found to be statistically associated with having received a diagnosis of epilepsy were incorporated into a logistic regression model. Among 113 patients with NF1 included in this study (median age at study inclusion: 33 years), the lifelong prevalence of epilepsy was 11% (CI<sub>95%</sub>=6-18%) and point prevalence 7% (CI<sub>95%</sub>= 3-13%). Most patients (73%) were diagnosed with epilepsy before the age of 18 and achieved seizure-freedom by adulthood. At study inclusion, three-quarters of patients with a diagnosis of epilepsy had been seizure-free for more than one year and a third had resolved epilepsy. A routine EEG with epileptiform discharges had a sensitivity of 25% (CI<sub>95%</sub>=3-65) and specificity of 99% (CI<sub>95%</sub>=93-100) for identifying adult patients with NF1 and unresolved epilepsy. A history of epilepsy was associated with having a low-grade glioma (OR: 38.2; CI<sub>95%</sub>=2.2-674.7; p<0.01), learning disability (OR: 5.7; CI<sub>95%</sub>=1.0-31.5; p<0.05), and no plexiform neurofibroma (OR: 0.05; CI<sub>95%</sub>=0.0-0.8; p=0.04). No single mutation type was associated with the development of epilepsy. In patients with NF1, although resolution of epilepsy over time was observed in many cases, the prevalence of epilepsy was higher among adults with NF1 than that reported in the general population. Epileptogenesis in NF1 likely requires the combination of multiple genetic and environmental factors and suggests involvement of a network that spreads beyond the borders of a well-defined parenchymal lesion."

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is associated with the development of benign (BPNST) and malignant (MPNST) peripheral nerve sheath tumors. Recently described atypical neurofibromas (ANF) are considered pre-malignant precursor lesions to MPNSTs. Previous studies indicate that diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) can reliably discriminate MPNSTs from BPNSTs. We therefore investigated the diagnostic accuracy of DW-MRI for the discrimination of benign, atypical, and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors. In this prospective explorative single-center phase II diagnostic study, 44 NF1 patients (23 male; 30.1 ± 11.8 years) underwent DW-MRI (<i>b</i>-values 0-800 s/mm²) at 3T. Two radiologists independently assessed mean and minimum apparent diffusion coefficients (ADC<sub>mean/min</sub>) in areas of largest tumor diameters and ADC<sub>dark</sub> in areas of lowest signal intensity by manual contouring of the tumor margins of 60 BPNSTs, 13 ANFs, and 21 MPNSTs. Follow-up of ≥ 24 months (BPNSTs) or histopathological evaluation (ANFs + MPNSTs) served as diagnostic reference standard. Diagnostic ADC-based cut-off values for discrimination of the three tumor groups were chosen to yield the highest possible specificity while maintaining a clinically acceptable sensitivity. ADC values of pre-malignant ANFs clustered between BPNSTs and MPNSTs. Best BPNST vs. ANF + MPNST discrimination was obtained using ADC<sub>dark</sub> at a cut-off value of 1.6 × 10<sup>-3</sup> mm<sup>2</sup>/s (85.3% sensitivity, 93.3% specificity), corresponding to an AUC of 94.3% (95% confidence interval: 85.2-98.0). Regarding BPNST + ANF vs. MPNST, best discrimination was obtained using an ADC<sub>dark</sub> cut-off value of 1.4 × 10<sup>-3</sup> mm<sup>2</sup>/s (83.3% sensitivity, 94.5% specificity).

We included patients treated at Gustave Roussy (GR) between January 1980 and December 2015 for OPG, before 18 years old and alive at 5 years from diagnosis. Mortality and physical health conditions data were extracted from medical data files and updated, thanks to the GR long-term follow-up program and French national mortality registry for patients included in the French Childhood Cancer Survivor Study. We included 182 5-year OPG-childhood survivors in the analysis (sex ratio M/F 0.8, 35% with neurofibromatosis type 1 [NF1]). With a median follow-up of 17.2 years (range = 5-41), we registered 82 relapses, 9 second malignancies, and 15 deaths as first events after 5 years, resulting in 20-year conditional overall survival (C-OS) and late events-free survival of 79.9% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 71-86) and 43.5% (95% CI = 36-51), respectively. Radiotherapy exposure in NF1 patients (hazard ratio [HR] = 6, 95% CI = 1.7-21.2) and hypothalamic involvement (HR = 3.2, 95% CI = 1.4-7.3) were significantly associated with C-OS in multivariable analyses. Ninety-five percent of 5-year OPG survivors suffered from any health condition, especially visual acuity \"<1/10\" (n = 109), pituitary deficiency (n = 106), and neurocognitive impairment (n = 89). NF1 (HR 2.1) was associated with precocious puberty. With a median time post-diagnosis of 4.2 years, 33 cerebrovascular events were observed in 21 patients. Late relapses, second malignancies, and cerebrovascular diseases are severe late events resulting in premature mortality. Morbidity is high and needs after-cancer care to improve quality of life. Risk factors could be considered to better stratify long-term follow-up."

An MRI of the brain demonstrated a homogeneously enhancing left frontal mass; although rare, given her history of pulmonary MPNST, brain invasion was considered likely. No generally accepted guidelines for the treatment of MPNST with cerebral metastases exist; however, LITT was chosen due to tumor morphology and proximity to eloquent brain structures. She did not experience any new or worsening neurological deficits post-operatively. Post-ablation MRI showed white matter edema surrounding the lesion, which is consistent with previously reported cases. This case illustrates the use of LITT for cytoreduction for rare brain metastases located near eloquent brain structures."

The neural mechanisms underlying tDCS interventions in genetic disorders, typically characterized by cognitive deficits, are grounded in the concept of brain plasticity. We initially present the neurobiological and functional effects elicited by tDCS applications in enhancing neuroplasticity and in regulating the excitatory/inhibitory balance, both associated with cognitive improvement in the general population. The review begins with evidence on tDCS applications in five neurogenetic disorders, including Rett, Prader-Willi, Phelan-McDermid, and Neurofibromatosis 1 syndromes, as well as DS. Available evidence supports tDCS as a potential intervention tool and underscores the importance of advancing neurobiological research into the mechanisms of tDCS action in these conditions. We then discuss the potential of tDCS as a promising non-invasive strategy to mitigate deficits in plasticity and promote fine-tuning of the excitatory/inhibitory balance in DS, exploring implications for cognitive treatment perspectives in this population."

    "abstract": "A retrospective cohort study. To determine outcomes following all-posterior surgery using computed tomography navigation, hybrid stabilization, and multiple anchor point techniques in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1) and dystrophic scoliosis. Previous studies favored antero-posterior fusion as the most reliable method; however, approaching the spine anteriorly was fraught with significant complications. With the advent of computer assisted navigation and multiple anchor point method, posterior only approach is reporting successful outcomes. This study included patients who underwent all-posterior surgical deformity correction for dystrophic NF-1 curves. Coronal and sagittal Cobbs angles, apical rotation, and the presence of dystrophic features were evaluated before surgery. Postoperatively, sagittal, coronal, and axial correction, implant position, and implant densities were evaluated. The decline in curve correction and implant-related complications were evaluated at follow-up. Clinical outcomes were evaluated using the Scoliosis Research Society-22 revised index. This study involved 50 patients with a mean age of 13.6 years and a mean follow-up duration of 5.52 years. With a mean coronal flexibility of 18.7%, the mean apical vertebral rotation (AVR), preoperative coronal Cobb angle, and sagittal kyphosis were 27.4°, 64.01°, and 47.70°, respectively. The postoperative mean coronal Cobb angle was 30.17° (p <0.05), and the sagittal kyphosis angle was 25.4° (p <0.05). The average AVR correction rate was 41.3%. The correction remained significant at the final mean follow-up, with a coronal Cobb angle of 34.14° and sagittal kyphosis of 25.02° (p <0.05). The average implant density was 1.41, with 46% of patients having a high implant density (HID). The HID had a markedly higher mean curve correction (29.30° vs. 38.05°, p <0.05) and a lower mean loss of correction (5.7° vs. 3.8°, p <0.05).

This present study utilizes a population-level database to estimate TCS incidence among pediatric patients with neurofibromatosis types 1 and 2 (NF1, NF2). The TriNetX Research Network was queried to identify patients diagnosed with NF and/or TCS before the age of 21. Symptomatic TCS requiring surgical intervention was identified using corresponding procedural codes within 12 months following TCS diagnosis. Odds ratios (OR) were calculated to measure the associations of NF1/NF2 with TCS. 19,426 pediatric NF patients were evaluated (NF1: 18,383, NF2: 1042). The average ages of TCS diagnosis among NF1, NF2, and non-NF patients were 12, 16, and 9 years, respectively. The incidence of TCS was 1.2% in NF1 patients and 7.3% in NF2 patients, compared to 0.074% in the general population. The associations of NF incidence with TCS were significantly increased in both NF1 (OR 16.42; 14.38-18.76) and NF2 (OR 105.58; 83.56-133.40) patients compared to the general population. Symptomatic TCS requiring surgical intervention was not significantly associated with NF1/NF2 patients compared to the general TCS population. This analysis demonstrates a high incidence of TCS but delayed intervention in pediatric NF patients. Considering TCS counseling, spinal MRI, and earlier intervention may be warranted for NF patients experiencing musculoskeletal symptomatology."

The most frequent NF1 large deletion is 1.4 Mb, resulting from homologous recombination between two low copy repeats. This \"type-1\" deletion is associated with a severe clinical phenotype in NF1 patients, with several phenotypic manifestations including learning disability, a much earlier development of cutaneous neurofibromas, an increased tumour risk, and cardiovascular malformations. NF1 adjacent co-deleted genes could act as modifier loci for the specific clinical manifestations observed in deleted NF1 patients. Furthermore, other genetic modifiers (such as CNVs) not located at the NF1 locus could also modulate the phenotype observed in patients with large deletions. In this study, we analysed 22 NF1 deletion patients by genome-wide array-CGH with the aim (1) to correlate deletion length to observed phenotypic features and their severity in NF1 deletion syndrome, and (2) to identify whether the deletion phenotype could also be modulated by copy number variations elsewhere in the genome. We then review the role of co-deleted genes in the 1.4 Mb interval of type-1 deletions, and their possible implication in the main clinical features observed in this high-risk group of NF1 patients."

Moreover, possible benefits of MEK inhibitor therapy on cognitive functioning in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) were recently shown which supports the need for further evaluation. Thirty-six patients with NF1 (age range 3-19 years) enrolled in the phase II study of trametinib underwent a neurocognitive assessment at inclusion and at completion of the 72-week treatment. Age-appropriate Wechsler Intelligence Scales and the Trail Making Test (for children over 8 years old) were administered at each assessment. Paired t-tests and Reliable Change Index (RCI) analyses were performed to investigate change in neurocognitive outcomes. Regression analyses were used to investigate the contribution of age and baseline score in the prediction of change. Stable performance on neurocognitive tests was revealed at a group-level using paired t-tests. Clinically significant improvements were however found on specific indexes of the Wechsler intelligence scales and Trail Making Test, using RCI analyses. No significant impact of age on cognitive change was evidenced. However, lower initial cognitive performance was associated with increased odds of presenting clinically significant improvements on neurocognitive outcomes. These preliminary results show a potential positive effect of trametinib on cognition in patients with NF1. We observed significant improvements in processing speed, visuo-motor and verbal abilities. This study demonstrates the importance of including neuropsychological evaluations into clinical trial when using MEK inhibitors for patients with NF1."

We reviewed institutional medical records of patients under 30 years with a diagnosis of \"NF1,\" \"NF2,\" or \"other neurofibromatoses\" on MEKi therapy between January 1, 2019 and June 1, 2022. We recorded the time-to-onset, type, and distribution of CAEs, non-cutaneous adverse events (AEs), AE management, and tumor response.

Other common CAEs were paronychia, seborrheic dermatitis, eczema, xerosis, and oral mucositis. The most common treatments included oral antibiotics and topical corticosteroids. Most patients had clinical (stable or improved) tumor response (71%) while 29% had tumor progression while on a MEKi. There was no significant association between CAE presence and tumor response (p = 0.39). Improvement in characterization of MEKi toxicities and their management is important to develop treatment guidelines for pediatric and young adult patients with NF1 on MEKi therapy."

Laboratory work up Full blood counts, electrolytes, renal and liver function tests were normal, MRI of the lumbar spine demonstrate L3/L4 and L4/l5 mild disc bulge with no significant narrowing of the primary canal and no evidence of existing nerve root impingement, increase antero-posterior diameter of dura sac involving L5-S1, with a Dural Sac Diameter of S1 increased compared to that of L4 with mild scalloping of lower lumbar vertebra and pronounced at S1 vertebral body. A diagnosis of cauda equina syndrome and dural ectasia secondary to neurofibromatosis was rendered. Lumbar peritoneal shunting, was reached as a surgical treatment for this patient, but due to inadequate and unavailability of the required shunting equipment, the patient was managed conservatively with anti- inflammatory medications, lumbar CSF tapping, genital hygiene and counselling. 3 months of follow up, the patient was able to walk, with power 5/5 to both lower limbs, however fecal and urine incontinence persisted. this case was particularly unusual due to the combination of cauda equina syndrome and dural ectasia, Dural ectasia is seen with various conditions including Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-syndrome, neurofibromatosis 1, Ankylosing spondylitis, trauma, scoliosis or tumors it may also have no clear cause. In most cases patients with dural ectasia are asymptomatic few may present with low back pain, radicular pain in the buttocks or legs and headache and rarely caudal equina syndrome. The management of dura ectasia may be conservative for asymptomatic patient and for a symptomatic patient surgery such as stabilization, marsupialization and lumbar peritoneal shunt. Dural ectasia with cauda equina syndrome are rarely complication of neurofibromatosis. Familiarity with its classic imaging and clinical features as described in this case report can help its early detection and management."

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis (NF) is a neurocutaneous syndrome characterized by the development of central or peripheral nervous system tumors. The most common form, known as NF1 or Von Recklinghausen's disease, presents with distinct clinical features, including cutaneous and ocular manifestations, along with various other organ and systemic symptoms. While the lung findings associated with neurofibromatosis lack specificity, they can include parenchymal cysts and bullae formation, primarily in the upper-apical regions. Additionally, progressive fibrotic changes, such as ground-glass areas, consolidations, and paving stone patterns, may manifest in the basal parts of the lungs. In this case report, a case of NF1 diagnosed in adulthood and accompanying pneumoconiosis was discussed as a coincidence."

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is caused by NF1 gene mutations. Patients with NF1 often have complications with tumors, such as neurofibroma. In order to investigate the pathogenesis of human neurofibroma, a systematic comparison of protein expression levels between Schwann cell-like sNF96.2 cells, which originated from malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST), and normal Schwann cells was performed using 4-D label-free proteomic analysis. In addition, the expression levels and localization of dysregulated proteins were confirmed using a Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) transcriptomic dataset, Western blot analysis, and immunofluorescence labeling. The effects of SRY-box transcription factor 9 (SOX9) in the neurofibroma and surrounding microenvironment were evaluated in vivo using a tumor transplantation model. The present study observed that SOX9 and procollagen C-endopeptidase enhancer (PCOLCE) were significantly altered. NF1 mutation promoted the nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity of SOX9 in neurofibromas. SOX9 increased collagen VI secretions by enhancing the activation of PCOLCE in neurofibroma cells. These findings might provide new perspectives on the pathophysiological significance of SOX9 in neurofibromas and elucidate a novel molecular mechanism underlying neurofibromas."

Bleeding has been reported as a complication of plexiform neurofibroma due to vascular fragility and vasculopathy that may develop into life-threatening bleeding especially after excision procedure. Consequently, post excision complications also include dehiscence and infection. We report a 23-year-old male with elephantiasis of the left lower extremity due to giant plexiform neurofibroma who underwent preoperative embolization followed by serial surgical mass reduction. There were postoperative complications consisting of hematoma, wound dehiscence, and infection. Negative pressure wound therapy is often used to accelerate wound healing, including infected wounds. However, negative pressure wound therapy has been a debatable modality for wound care of neurofibroma due to reported risks of profuse bleeding during its use. In this case, despite the size, negative-pressure wound therapy has shown good results for infected neurofibroma wounds and as an adjunct as wound dressing for defect closure of neurofibroma with split-thickness skin graft."

Increased incidence of CGCGs in NF1 patients was thought to be caused by an underlying susceptibility to developing CGCG-like lesions in qualitatively abnormal bone, such as fibrous dysplasia. However, germline and somatic truncating second-hit mutations in the NF1 gene have been detected in NF1 patients with CGCGs, validating that they are NF1-associated lesions. Oral manifestations in patients with NF1 are very common. Knowledge of these manifestations and the genetic link between NF1 and CGCGs will enhance early detection and enable optimal patient care."

This retrospective study sought to describe the clinical presentation and outcomes of children with OPG at a tertiary center in Mexico. Consecutive patients <18 years-of-age with newly diagnosed OPG between January 2002 and December 2020 at the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara Dr. Juan I. Menchaca in Guadalajara, Mexico were included. Thirty patients were identified with a median age of six years. The most frequent clinical manifestations were loss of visual acuity (40%) and headaches (23%). Neurofibromatosis-1 was found in 23.3% of the patients. Surgery, either biopsy or resection, was done in 20 of 30 patients. Two patients died shortly after initial surgery. The 5-year event-free survival (EFS) was 79.3% ± 10.8% and the 5-year overall survival was 89.5% ± 6.9%. Lower EFS was associated with age less than 3 years, intracranial hypertension at presentation, and diencephalic syndrome. Patients who received surgery as first-line treatment had a 3.1 times greater risk of achieving a performance score of less than 90 points at 6 months after diagnosis (p=0.006). Of 10 patients with vision testing, 5 had improvement in visual acuity, 4 had no changes, and one patient showed worsening. Our data suggests that favorable outcomes can be achieved with OPG in low- and middle-income countries, although a high rate of surgical complications was described leading to a lower overall survival. These data can be used prospectively to optimize treatment at this institute and other middle-income countries through a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach."

Until recently, ophthalmologic consultations in patients with NF1 were limited mainly to the observation of Lisch nodules of the iris and the presence of optic nerve glioma. However, advances in imaging capabilities have made it possible to investigate and describe new f indings concerning the ocular manifestations of this disease. Between October 2020 and November 2021, we examined the anterior and posterior segment of 76 eyes (38 children – 12 boys and 26 girls) with genetically confirmed NF1 gene mutation at our clinic. The age of the patients ranged from 4 to 18 years. The anterior segment was checked for the presence of Lisch nodules biomicroscopically with a slit lamp. On the posterior segment, the presence of choroidal nodules was checked by various imaging methods – fundus camera, infrared confocal selective laser ophthalmoscopy, MultiColor imaging, OCT, and OCT angiography. All the patients had magnetic resonance imaging performed in order to detect potential optic nerve gliomas for the purpose of diagnosis. We observed the correlation between the patients’ age, presence of Lisch nodules and the presence of choroidal nodules. Eight patients also had other manifestations of the disease – optic nerve gliomas or microvascular changes (so-called “corkscrew” vessels). Out of 38 patients, Lisch iris nodules were present in 20 patients (53%) and choroidal nodules in 24 patients (63%). There was no positive correlation between the presence of these two manifestations within the same patient or eye, but there is a clear correlation between the presence of choroidal nodules and patient age. The results suggest that a previously unknown ocular manifestation of neurofibromatosis type I, namely choroidal nodules, has a higher prevalence than Lisch nodules also in the pediatric population and can be easily visualized using various imaging modalities. It will be important to include follow-up observation of this finding among the standard controls for ocular findings in NF1, and it will be very interesting to correlate this f inding with the exact NF1 mutation"

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a rare neurogenetic disorder characterized by multiple organ system involvement and a predisposition to benign and malignant tumor development. With revised NF1 clinical criteria and the availability of germline genetic testing, there is now an opportunity to render an early diagnosis, expedite medical surveillance, and initiate treatment in a prompt and targeted manner. The authors review the spectrum of medical problems associated with NF1, focusing specifically on children and young adults. The age-dependent appearance of NF1-associated features is highlighted, and the currently accepted medical treatments are discussed. Additionally, future directions for optimizing the care of this unique population of children are outlined. The appearance of NF1-related medical problems is age dependent, requiring surveillance for those features most likely to occur at any given age during childhood. As such, we advocate a life stage-focused screening approach beginning in infancy and continuing through the transition to adult care. With early detection, it becomes possible to promptly institute therapies and reduce patient morbidity. Importantly, with continued advancement in our understanding of disease pathogenesis, future improvements in the care of children with NF1 might incorporate improved risk assessments and more personalized molecularly targeted treatments."

    "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune neurodegenerative disease which can rarely co-exist with neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1), a neurocutaneous inherited disorder that predisposes to oncogenesis. Patients who suffer from both conditions can be challenging cases for clinicians, as clinical symptoms and radiological findings may overlap, while MS immune-modifying treatments could further increase the risk of oncogenesis. In this study, we describe the case of a 27-year-old woman who presented with signs and symptoms of optic neuritis and was then diagnosed with both MS and NF1. As the patient continued to experience MS relapses despite initial interferon-beta treatment, she was subsequently switched to natalizumab and responded well. This case illustrates how MRI lesion differentiation with the co-existence of MS and NF1 can be difficult due to overlaps in lesion characteristics, while treatment decisions can be challenging mainly due to scarce data on the oncogenic risk of MS immunomodulary therapies. Therefore, clinicians need to balance out the risk of malignancy development with the risk of progressive neurological disability when treating such patients."

Cohorts of NF1 patients with or without plexiform neurofibromas (PN) were identified from the Medical Data Vision database in 2008-2019. Baseline characteristics, NF1 medications, HCRU, and associated costs were assessed using descriptive statistics. All-cause HCRU and costs following the first confirmed NF1 diagnosis date were analyzed per patient per year (PPPY) in Japanese Yen (JPY) and United States Dollar (USD). A total of 4394 NF1 patients without PN and 370 NF1 patients with PN were identified. The mean age was 35.0 and 36.9 years, respectively. The proportion of patients with PN treated with medications was higher than that in patients without PN (except for antirheumatic/immunologic agents). Analgesics/non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were the most frequently prescribed NF1 medications (44.3% and 56.0% in patients without and with PN, respectively), followed by inpatient prescriptions of opioids/opioid-like agents (17.8% and 27.6%, respectively). Inpatient admissions accounted for the highest costs in both cohorts with the average cost PPPY being JPY 2,133,277 (USD 19,861) for patients without PN and JPY 1,052,868 (USD 9802) for patients with PN. NF1 is treated primarily with supportive care with analgesics/non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs being the most frequently prescribed NF1 medications in Japan. Findings underscored the unmet need and substantial economic burden among patients with NF1 and highlighted the need for new treatment options for patients with this disease."

NF1 is associated with considerable esthetic and functional burden negatively affecting the patient's quality of life (QoL). This study aims to assess the clinical features of NF1 patients and evaluate their impact on QoL. We identified NF1 patients from a public health database of a region in Spain. All patients underwent clinical and ophthalmological evaluation for NF1 features. We measured QoL using the Spanish version of the Skindex-29. Forty patients fulfilled the NF1 National Institute of Health criteria when we recruited patients. The median age was 42.00 years (IQR 26.5 -53.75). The median total Skindex-29 score was 12.3 (IQR 5.9-22.4); (emotion: 15.0, IQR 5.0-37.5; symptoms 8.9, IQR 0.0-17.9 and functioning 8.3; IQR 0.5-18.3). Women and NF1 patients with lower educational levels were associated with poorer QoL scores. We identified itching and sleep troubles to influence NF1 patients' QoL negatively. NF1 considerably influences the psychological well-being of NF1 patients. We observed that female and low-educated patients scored higher on the emotional dimension of the Skindex-29 and could, therefore, be more at risk of depression. We also pointed out some \"minor symptoms\" that negatively impact NF1 patients' QoL such, as itching and sleep troubles which doctors could treat if sought by doctors."

A retrospective review was conducted on 14 patients diagnosed with a VVF who underwent endovascular treatment at Siriraj Hospital from January 2000 to January 2023. The study assessed patient demographics, presentation, fistula location, treatment strategies, endovascular techniques employed, and treatment outcomes. Among the 14 patients, 11 (78.6%) were female, with an age range from 25 to 79 years (median: 50 years). Spontaneous VVFs were observed in 64.3% of the cases, including three associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1). Iatrogenic injury accounted for two cases, and three patients had VVFs resulting from traffic accidents. A pulsatile neck mass and tinnitus, with or without neurological deficits, were common presenting symptoms. Active bleeding was observed in three cases with vascular injury, while unilateral proptosis, congestive heart failure, and incidental findings each presented in one patient. All the VVFs were successfully obliterated without major treatment complications. Parent vessel sacrifice was performed in 85.7% of the cases, while vertebral artery preservation was achieved in the remaining two patients. Embolic materials included detachable balloons, detachable coils, and n-butyl cyanoacrylate (NBCA) glue. All the presenting symptoms showed improvement, and no morbidity or mortality was observed. Endovascular embolization is a feasible and effective approach for achieving complete VVF obliteration with safety. Parent artery sacrifice should not be reluctantly performed, particularly when adequate collateral circulation is demonstrated."

CNFs cause disfigurement, pain, burning, and itching, resulting in substantially reduced QOL in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1. CNFs are benign tumors that exhibit cellular and molecular heterogeneity, making it difficult to develop tractable in vitro or in vivo models. As a result, CNF research and drug discovery efforts have been limited. To address this need, we developed a reproducible patient-derived explant (PDE) ex vivo culture model using CNF tumors from patients with neurofibromatosis type 1. CNF PDEs remain viable in culture for over 9 days and recapitulate the cellular composition and molecular signaling of CNFs. Using CNF PDEs as a model system, we found that proliferation was associated with increased T-cell infiltration. Furthermore, we identified a pattern of reciprocal inflammatory signaling in CNF PDEs in which tumors rely on prostaglandin or leukotriene-mediated signaling pathways. As proof of principle, we show that ex vivo glucocorticoid treatment reduced the expression of proinflammatory genes, confirming that CNF PDEs are a useful model for both mechanistic studies and preclinical drug testing."

    "abstract": "Among low-grade gliomas, representing 10-20% of all primary brain tumours, the paradigmatic entity is constituted by pilocytic astrocytoma (PA), considered a grade 1 tumour by the World Health Organization. Generally, this tumour requires surgical treatment with an infrequent progression towards malignant gliomas. The present review focuses on clinicopathological characteristics, and reports imaging, neurosurgical and molecular features using a multidisciplinary approach. Macroscopically, PA is a slow-growing soft grey tissue, characteristically presenting in association with a cyst and forming a small mural nodule, typically located in the cerebellum, but sometimes occurring in the spinal cord, basal ganglia or cerebral hemisphere. Microscopically, it may appear as densely fibrillated areas composed of elongated pilocytic cells with bipolar 'hairlike' processes or densely fibrillated areas composed of elongated pilocytic cells with Rosenthal fibres alternating with loosely fibrillated areas with a varied degree of myxoid component. A wide range of molecular alterations have been encountered in PA, mostly affecting the MAPK signalling pathway. In detail, the most frequent alteration is a rearrangement of the BRAF gene, although other alterations include neurofibromatosis type-1 mutations, BRAFV600E mutations, KRAS mutations, fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 mutations of fusions, neurotrophic receptor tyrosine kinase family receptor tyrosine kinase fusions and RAF1 gene fusions. The gold standard of PA treatment is surgical excision with complete margin resection, achieving minimal neurological damage. Conventional radiotherapy is not required; the more appropriate treatment appears to be serial follow-up. Chemotherapy should only be applied in younger children to avoid the risk of long-term growth and developmental issues associated with radiation. Finally, if PA recurs, a new surgical approach should be performed. At present, novel therapy involving agents targeting MAPK signalling pathway dysregulation is in development, defining BRAF and MEK inhibitors as target therapeutical agents."

It is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, with many patients having the syndrome as the result of a de novo mutation. NF-1 is caused by a mutation in the NF-1 gene located on the chromosome 17q11.2. NF-1 gene mutations result in the absence or reduced function of neurofibromin protein, thereby promoting tumor development and other clinical findings. NF-1 is fully penetrant, and it is commonly manifested by café-au-lait macules, axillary and/or inguinal freckling, neurofibromas, and Lisch nodules in the eyes. Skeletal manifestations include scoliosis, short stature, long bone dysplasia, and pseudoarthrosis. Rarely, NF-1 can manifest lambdoid suture defects. This report describes the case of a 12-year-old neurofibromatosis patient who presented to the pediatric clinic with a palpable posterior scalp defect, as well as café-au-lait macules and Lisch nodules. Diagnosis of NF-1 was made clinically. MRI and CT scan were done, and the patient was diagnosed with a lambdoid suture defect that is not associated with plexiform neurofibroma. Moreover, whole exome sequence (WES) was done, and diagnosis of NF-1 was confirmed. Watchful waiting and continuous monitoring were the management of choice for this case."

Correcting deformities while considering long-term growth in early-onset scoliosis (EOS) treatment is important. This study was performed to establish the safety and effectiveness of halo gravity traction (HGT) with traditional growing rods (TGRs) in NF-1 EOS. We retrospectively reviewed a cohort of 15 children (7 boys and 8 girls; mean age, 5.61 years) diagnosed with NF-1 EOS from October 2016 to March 2021. All patients underwent HGT before growing rod implantation. The growing rods were lengthened every 9-12 months, with a follow-up of 2-7 years. Cobb angle, thoracic kyphosis (TK), trunk shift (TS), sagittal vertebral axis and T1-S1 height were measured before operation, after traction, after operation and at last follow-up. Complications were also recorded. Fifteen patients with NF-1 EOS were treated with an average traction weight of 10.00 kg. After 29.20 days of HGT, the Cobb angle improved from 99.10° to 62.60°, TK from 79.33° to 55.04°, TS from 31.05 to 17.71 mm, sagittal vertebral axis from 42.07 to 25.63 mm and T1-S1 height from 27.50 to 29.70 cm ( P < 0.05 for all). Postoperatively, compared with post-traction, the Cobb angle was 52.40° ( P = 0.002) and TK was 44.54° ( P = 0.004). No complications occurred during traction. Growing rod dislocation occurred in one patient and growing rod breakage in one patient. HGT combined with TGRs was well-tolerated and effective for treating severe NF-1 EOS. It significantly corrected the Cobb angle and TK, restored trunk balance, and increased spinal height with few complications."

The infrequent occurrence lessens its clinical awareness in addition to its clinical semblance to many common cutaneous lesions. It is characterized by proclivity for local recurrence. We evaluated the clinical presentation and treatment outcomes of six consecutive cases of DFSP with histologic diagnosis in the University of Calabar Teaching Hospital, Calabar seen between January 2013 and December 2022. This was compared with total cutaneous malignances in the same period. The six consecutive patients comprised of two males and four females (M = F: 1:2) whose ages ranged from 21 to 57 years (mean of 36.5 years) and accounted for 7% of cutaneous malignancies. The site distribution was trunk (back) involved in 3 (50%) of the patients, limbs 3 (50%); upper 1 (17%) and lower limb 2 (33%). Clinical presentation was in the form of firm cutaneous mass with some ulcerated lesions that bled and some fungated. 50 percent of the patients presented with recurrent lesions and in all there was no regional lymphadenopathy or evidence of metastasis. There was a patient with Neurofibromatosis- 1 who had a huge fungated limb lesion offered amputation, four had wide local excision and one incision biopsy. Follow up was poor and the period ranged from 2 to 14 months (mean 7 months). Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans is an uncommon tumour with clinical semblance to other cutaneous lesions. Early presentation, preoperative histologic diagnosis will enhance the goal of ensuring adequate excision. Adjuvant therapy with Imatinib with or without adjuvant radiotherapy are recommended in the treatment plan in view of the frequency of late presentation with advanced recurrent lesions and poor follow up."

    "title": "Salivary Duct Carcinoma Arising in the Submandibular Gland in a Patient with Neurofibromatosis Type 1.",
    "abstract": "A 71-year-old man with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) presented to our department with a 1-week history of a painful mass in the left submandibular area. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging revealed an irregular-shaped tumor with a diameter of 2.0 cm in the left submandibular gland and a metastatic lymph node with a diameter of 1.0 cm adjacent to the tumor. Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/CT revealed increased uptake in the tumor. Fine-needle aspiration cytology revealed atypical cells, suggesting salivary duct carcinoma (SDC). Left neck dissection with resection of the tumor and submandibular gland was performed under general anesthesia. Histologic examination revealed ductal formation with a solid, cystic, cribriform, and papillary structure with intraductal comedonecrosis, diagnosing as SDC originating in the submandibular gland (pT3N1M0 pStage III). Mutational analysis of 160 cancer-related genes by next-generation sequencing (NGS) revealed a germline and frameshift mutation in the <i>NF1</i> gene (p.R2408Kfs*14) and a somatic and frameshift mutation in the <i>TP53</i> gene (p.C176Wfs*22). The patient received postoperative radiotherapy to the left neck area at 66 Gy. No evidence of recurrence or metastasis has been observed as of 10 months postoperatively. This is the first reported case of SDC in the submandibular gland in a patient with NF1. The mutational data by NGS may contribute to a better understanding of the oncogenesis of SDC in patients with NF1."

    "abstract": "Diagnosed intrathoracic meningocele is an uncommon complication of neurofibromatosis type 1. We report an anesthesia management for a rare case undergoing thoracoscopic resection of a huge intrathoracic meningocele. A 51-year-old woman was scheduled for thoracoscopic meningectomy under general anesthesia. We monitored intrathecal pressure during anesthesia to prevent a decrease in intrathecal pressure. During surgery, the intrathecal pressure occasionally increased by around 5 cmH<sub>2</sub>O immediately after the insertion of the drainage tube and occasionally decreased by up to 10 cmH<sub>2</sub>O during the careful slow aspiration of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The pressure rapidly recovered after the interruption of the procedures. She was discharged on postoperative day 4 without major complications. The CSF pressure was fluctuated by procedures during thoracoscopic resection of a huge meningocele. A CSF pressure monitoring was useful to detect the sudden change of CSF pressure immediately, which can cause intracranial hemorrhage."

    "abstract": "Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are the leading cause of death in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1. They can result from premalignant neurofibromas, including neurofibromas with atypia and atypical neurofibromatous neoplasms of uncertain biologic potential. Some phenotypic characteristics have been described as associated with their development. The aim of this study was to outline our use of whole-body positron emission tomography with <sup>18</sup>F-fluorodeoxyglucose/magnetic resonance imaging in adults with neurofibromatosis type 1, especially in the screening of asymptomatic individuals with a higher risk of developing an MPNST, and to study its impact on neurofibroma classification (malignant vs premalignant) and MPNST staging over time. Individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1 who underwent a positron emission tomography with <sup>18</sup>F-fluorodeoxyglucose/magnetic resonance imaging between 2017 and 2021 were included, analyzing separately the screened population. Maximum standard uptake value and diffusion-weighted imaging were assessed. Biopsy/surgery confirmed the diagnosis. In all, 345 positron emission tomography with <sup>18</sup>F-fluorodeoxyglucose/magnetic resonance imaging were performed in 241 patients, including 149 asymptomatic (62%) but at-risk patients. Eight MPNSTs in 8 screened individuals (5%), 6 neurofibromas with atypia in 4 individuals (3%), and 29 atypical neurofibromatous neoplasms of uncertain biologic potential in 23 individuals (15%) were diagnosed. Over time, the proportion of grade 3 MPNST and the malignant/premalignant ratio in screened individuals significantly decreased (P = .03 and P < .001, respectively). This study emphasizes the diagnostic and screening performances of whole-body positron emission tomography with <sup>18</sup>F-fluorodeoxyglucose/magnetic resonance imaging in adults with neurofibromatosis type 1."

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a genetic cancer predisposition syndrome that can impact multiple organ systems and is associated with plexiform neurofibroma tumors, requiring care from birth through adulthood. Adolescents and young adults (AYAs) with NF1 face several barriers to transition from pediatric to adult care. This cross-sectional study aimed to assess transition readiness in this population and to evaluate relationships between specific NF1 symptoms and transition readiness. AYAs (aged 16-24) enrolled in existing studies related to NF1 were eligible. AYAs and their parents completed measures of transition readiness (Transition Readiness Assessment Questionnaire version 4 [TRAQ-4]), and AYAs also completed a transition readiness interview (UNC TRxANSITION). Thirty-eight AYAs (mean age = 19.95 ± 2.68 years) participated in the study. Average TRAQ scores indicated that AYAs were still learning Self-Management skills (M = 3.37, SD = 1.08) and Self-Advocacy skills (M = 3.98, SD = 0.67). Older AYAs had higher TRAQ scores for Self-Management (r = 0.70, p < .001) and Self-Advocacy (r = 0.41, p = .011) than younger AYAs. Parents and AYAs had similar TRAQ scores. About one third of AYAs (37.8%, n = 14) expressed uncertainty about how NF1 might affect them in the future. The remaining AYAs mostly expressed concerns regarding tumor growth, pain, or cancer. In this small study, preliminary findings suggest that AYAs with NF1 express confidence in many areas of transition readiness but continue to require support, particularly with Self-Management skills. Given the gaps in understanding of future health risks, AYAs with NF1 would benefit from early assessment, psychoeducation, and support for transition readiness to adult care."

    "abstract": "Neurocutaneous syndromes comprise a heterogeneous group of congenital or hereditary conditions that are known to be associated with the risk of different disorders and complications. Two of the most common neurocutaneous syndromes are Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC). Although there appears to be a general consensus on the importance of a multidisciplinary approach in managing these cases, there is still very little emphasis in discussions addressed in the literature on the role of dentistry in accordance with the perspective of comprehensive care. Evidence-based propositions, together with a broad discussion of new insights in this regard, should have the ability to strongly impact related future perspectives, aiming for greater advances and better outcomes for these patients. In this review article, the authors discuss updated general aspects of NF1 and TSC, and the potential additional roles of dentistry, in addition to addressing suggestions for actions in dentistry at related levels of care, as well as priorities for future research."

    "abstract": "Patients affected by neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) frequently show muscle weakness with unknown etiology. Here we show that, in mice, Neurofibromin 1 (Nf1) is not required in muscle fibers, but specifically in early postnatal myogenic progenitors (MPs), where Nf1 loss led to cell cycle exit and differentiation blockade, depleting the MP pool resulting in reduced myonuclear accretion as well as reduced muscle stem cell numbers. This was caused by precocious induction of stem cell quiescence coupled to metabolic reprogramming of MPs impinging on glycolytic shutdown, which was conserved in muscle fibers. We show that a Mek/Erk/NOS pathway hypersensitizes Nf1-deficient MPs to Notch signaling, consequently, early postnatal Notch pathway inhibition ameliorated premature quiescence, metabolic reprogramming and muscle growth. This reveals an unexpected role of Ras/Mek/Erk signaling supporting postnatal MP quiescence in concert with Notch signaling, which is controlled by Nf1 safeguarding coordinated muscle growth and muscle stem cell pool establishment. Furthermore, our data suggest transmission of metabolic reprogramming across cellular differentiation, affecting fiber metabolism and function in NF1."

We carried out a retrospective chart review of children with NF1. We recorded demographic characteristics, clinical manifestations of disease, and ophthalmologic findings including visual acuity, intraocular pressure, cup-to-disc ratio, visual field testing, and optical coherence tomography findings. Ophthalmologic findings were examined for the cohort for initial and final appointments. These findings were also compared between eyes with and without OPGs. The study included 119 participants with 238 total eyes. The most common clinical manifestations of NF1 in this cohort were café au lait macules (98%), axillary or inguinal freckling (91%), Lisch nodules (66%), and cutaneous neurofibromas (57%). Thirty-seven participants had imaging that allowed evaluation for choroidal abnormalities, and 28 (76%) had choroidal lesions. Twenty-seven participants (23%) had OPGs, and 44 eyes were affected. On initial assessment, eyes with OPGs had worse visual acuity. On final examination, eyes with OPGs were more likely to have a worse visual acuity and a thinner generalised retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) thickness, inferior RNFL thickness, and temporal RNFL thickness. This study provides longitudinal follow-up of children affected by NF1 with and without OPGs. Eyes with OPGs were found to be associated with worse visual acuity and thinner RNFLs overall on final testing."

She was diagnosed with NF1 nine years ago by a gene mutation detection and coronary heart disease (CHD) three months ago. The patient was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) this time. After 24 days of treatment with appropriate medication, the patient was discharged with relieved joint pain. However, about four months later, the patient died of circulatory failure caused by myocardial infarction. We analyzed the possible reasons for her outcome and made a review of the literature. There are few clinical reports of NF1 complicated with RA. We found five cases reported in the literature up to date during our search and included them in our communication to compare with our case. NF1 combined with RA mainly affects adult women and usually starts with NF1 and is followed by RA after at least six years of NF1 symptom onset. Although the summarized characteristics of clinical and potential pathogenesis of NF1 combined with RA were limited with these six cases, we hope that this will help clinicians to increase their understanding of this rare complication, thus helping to guide clinical medication."

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is caused by mutations in the <i>NF1</i> gene. The clinical presentation of NF1 includes diverse neurological issues in pediatric and adult patients, ranging from learning disabilities, motor skill issues, and attention deficit disorder, to increased risk of depression and dementia. Preclinical research suggests that abnormal neuronal signaling mediates spatial learning and attention issues in NF1; however, drugs that improve phenotypes in models show inconclusive results in clinical trials, highlighting the need for a better understanding of NF1 pathophysiology and broader therapeutic options. Most NF1 patients show abnormalities in their brain white matter (WM) and myelin, and links with NF1 neuropathophysiology have been suggested; however, no current data can clearly support or refute this idea. We reported that myelin-targeted <i>Nf1</i> mutation impacts oligodendrocyte signaling, myelin ultrastructure, WM connectivity, and sensory-motor behaviors in mice; however, any impact on learning and memory remains unknown. Here, we adapted a voluntary running test-the complex wheel (CW; a wheel with unevenly spaced rungs)-to delineate fine motor skill learning curves following induction of an <i>Nf1</i> mutation in pre-existing myelinating cells (<i>pNf1</i> mice). We found that <i>pNf1</i> mutant females experience delayed or impaired learning in the CW, while proper learning in <i>pNf1</i> males is predominantly disrupted; these phenotypes add complexity to the gender-dependent learning differences in the mouse strain used. No broad differences in memory of acquired CW skills were detected in any gender, but gene-dose effects were observed at the studied time points. Finally, nitric oxide signaling regulation differentially impacted learning in wild type (WT)/<i>pNf1</i>, male/female mice. Our results provide evidence for fine motor skill learning issues upon induction of an <i>Nf1</i> mutation in mature myelinating cells. Together with previous connectivity, cellular, and molecular analyses, these results diversify the potential treatments for neurological issues in NF1."

However, little is known about specific aspects of written language impacted by NF1, changes in writing over time, and associations between cognitive aspects of the NF1 phenotype and writing. At three timepoints over six years, children with NF1 and plexiform neurofibromas (PNs) completed Woodcock-Johnson tests of writing mechanics (Spelling, Punctuation & Capitalization, handwriting), written expression of ideas (Writing Samples), writing speed (Writing Fluency), and tests of general cognitive ability, executive function, memory, and attention. Children (<i>N</i> = 76, mean age = 12.8 ± 3.4 years) completed at least one baseline writing subtest. Overall writing scores were in the Average range (<i>M</i> = 93.4, <i>SD</i> = 17.4), but lower than population norms (<i>p</i> = 0.002).

Writing scores were mostly stable over time. Nonverbal reasoning was related to some tests of writing mechanics and written expression of ideas. Short-term memory and inattention explained additional variance in Writing Samples and Spelling. Poor handwriting was associated with writing content beyond the impact of cognitive factors. Children with NF1 and PNs may benefit from early screening and writing support. Interventions should address the contribution of both cognitive and handwriting difficulties in written language."

We aimed to compare the long-term clinical, radiological, and cognitive effects of different revascularization procedures in a pediatric cohort of NF1-associated MMS. We reviewed the clinical, radiological, and surgical data of 26 patients with NF1-associated MMS diagnosed at our institution between 2012 and 2022, at the clinical onset and last follow-up. Indirect bypasses were performed in 12/26 patients (57.1%), while combined direct and indirect procedures in 9/26 subjects (42.9%); 5 patients did not undergo surgery. Through logistic regression analysis, pathological Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC) at onset was found to be associated with symptom improvement at 1-year follow up (p = 0.006). No significant differences were found in long-term neurocognitive outcome and stroke rate in patients receiving combined or indirect bypass (p > 0.05). Currently, whether combined or indirect bypass should be considered the treatment of choice in pediatric patients with NF1-associated MMS remains unclear, as well as the optimal time approach. In our series, no significant differences were found in long-term neurocognitive outcome and stroke rate between patients treated with either of these two approaches. Clinical evidence supports the crucial role of early diagnosis and surgical revascularization in subjects with MMS-associated NF1, even in case of mildly symptomatic vasculopathy. This allows to achieve a good long-term outcome with improved intellectual function and prevention of stroke and seizure in these patients."

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first documented case of using video-assisted thoracoscopic lateral interbody fusion to treat pseudarthrosis for NF1-associated spinal deformity. The patient underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic anterior spinal fusion via a direct lateral interbody approach with interbody cage placement at T10-T11 and T11-T12, followed by revision of his posterior spinal fusion and instrumentation. The patient had an uneventful postoperative course. At 6 months of follow-up, the patient had complete resolution of his preoperative symptoms and had returned to full-time work with no complaints. At 3 years postoperatively, the patient reported being satisfied with the operation and had continued to work full-time without restrictions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of pseudarthrosis in the setting of NF1-associated scoliosis treated via minimally invasive anterior thoracic fusion facilitated by video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery. This is a powerful technique that allows for safe access for anterior thoracic fusion in the setting of dysplastic posterior anatomy and poor posterior bone stock."

    "abstract": "Tissue injury and tumorigenesis share many cellular and molecular features, including immune cell (T cells, monocytes) infiltration and inflammatory factor (cytokines, chemokines) elaboration. Their common pathobiology raises the intriguing possibility that brain injury could create a tissue microenvironment permissive for tumor formation. Leveraging several murine models of the Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) cancer predisposition syndrome and two experimental methods of brain injury, we demonstrate that both optic nerve crush and diffuse traumatic brain injury induce optic glioma (OPG) formation in mice harboring Nf1-deficient preneoplastic progenitors. We further elucidate the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms, whereby glutamate released from damaged neurons stimulates IL-1β release by oligodendrocytes to induce microglia expression of Ccl5, a growth factor critical for Nf1-OPG formation. Interruption of this cellular circuit using glutamate receptor, IL-1β or Ccl5 inhibitors abrogates injury-induced glioma progression, thus establishing a causative relationship between injury and tumorigenesis."

By FISH, the MPNST harbored <i>CDKN2A</i> loss and recurred 1 year later. After reresection and radiotherapy, the patient is now disease-free without evidence of disease. Atypical neurofibromatous neoplasm with uncertain biologic potential is a newly defined entity, and it is important to discriminate it from low-grade MPNST, which requires more aggressive treatment methods.

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 associated plexiform neurofibroma (pNF) is characterized by abundant fibroblasts and dense collagen, yet the intricate interactions between tumor-origin cells (Schwann cells) and neurofibroma-associated fibroblasts (NFAFs) remain elusive. Employing single-cell RNA sequencing on human pNF samples, we generated a comprehensive transcriptomics dataset and conducted cell-cell communication analysis to unravel the molecular dynamics between Schwann cells and NFAFs. Our focus centered on the pleiotrophin (PTN)/nucleolin (NCL) axis as a pivotal ligand-receptor pair orchestrating this interaction. Validation of PTN involvement was affirmed through coculture models and recombinant protein experiments. Functional and mechanistic investigations, employing assays such as CCK8, EdU, Western Blot, ELISA, Hydroxyproline Assay, and Human phospho-kinase array, provided critical insights. We employed siRNA or inhibitors to intercept the PTN/NCL/proline-rich Akt substrate of 40 kDa (PRAS40) axis, validating the associated molecular mechanism. Our analysis highlighted a subset of Schwann cells closely linked to collagen deposition, underscoring their significance in pNF development. The PTN/NCL axis emerged as a key mediator of the Schwann cell-NFAF interaction. Furthermore, our study demonstrated that elevated PTN levels enhanced NFAF proliferation and collagen synthesis, either independently or synergistically with TGF-β1 in vitro. Activation of the downstream molecule PRAS40 was noted in NFAFs upon PTN treatment. Crucially, by targeting NCL and PRAS40, we successfully reversed collagen synthesis within NFAFs. In conclusion, our findings unveil the pivotal role of the PTN/NCL/PRAS40 axis in driving pNF development by promoting NFAFs proliferation and function. Targeting this pathway emerges as a potential therapeutic strategy for pNF. This study contributes novel insights into the molecular mechanisms governing pNF pathogenesis."

    "abstract": "Early detection of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) associated peripheral nerve sheath tumors (PNST) informs clinical decision-making, potentially averting deadly outcomes. Here, we describe a cell-free DNA (cfDNA) fragmentomic approach which distinguishes non-malignant, pre-malignant and malignant forms of NF1 PNST. Using plasma samples from a novel cohort of 101 NF1 patients and 21 healthy controls, we validated that our previous cfDNA copy number alteration (CNA)-based approach identifies malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) but cannot distinguish among benign and premalignant states. We therefore investigated the ability of fragment-based cfDNA features to differentiate NF1-associated tumors including binned genome-wide fragment length ratios, end motif analysis, and non-negative matrix factorization deconvolution of fragment lengths. Fragmentomic methods were able to differentiate pre-malignant states including atypical neurofibromas (AN). Fragmentomics also adjudicated AN cases suspicious for MPNST, correctly diagnosing samples noninvasively, which could have informed clinical management. Overall, this study pioneers the early detection of malignant and premalignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors in NF1 patients using plasma cfDNA fragmentomics. In addition to screening applications, this novel approach distinguishes atypical neurofibromas from benign plexiform neurofibromas and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, enabling more precise clinical diagnosis and management."

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is the most common neurocutaneous syndrome in the United States, affecting every 1 in 3000 individuals. NF1 occurs due to non-functional mutations in the NF1 gene, which expresses neurofibromin, a protein involved in tumour suppression. As a result, NF1 typically presents with non-cancerous neoplasm masses called neurofibromas across the body. Out of all NF1 abnormalities, the most common skeletal abnormality seen in around 10%-30% of NF1 patients is scoliosis, an improver curvature of the spine. However, there is a lack of research on the effects of scoliosis on demographics and morbidities of NF1 patients. We performed a national analysis to investigate the complex relationship between NF1 and scoliosis on patients' demographics and comorbidities. We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional analysis of the 2017 US National Inpatient Sample database using univariable Chi-square analysis and multivariable binary logistic regression analysis to determine the interplay of NF1 and scoliosis on patients' demographics and comorbidities. Our query resulted in 4635 total NF1 patients, of which 475 (10.25%) had scoliosis and 4160 (89.75%) did not. Demographic analysis showed that NF1 patients with scoliosis were typically younger, female and white compared to NF1 patients without scoliosis. Comorbidity analysis showed that NF1 patients with scoliosis were more likely to develop malignant brain neoplasms, epilepsy, hydrocephalus, pigmentation disorders, hypothyroidism, diabetes with chronic complications and coagulopathy disorders. NF1 patients with scoliosis were less likely to develop congestive heart failure, pulmonary circulation disease, peripheral vascular disease, paralysis, chronic pulmonary disease, lymphoma and psychosis. NF1 patients with scoliosis were predominantly younger, female, white patients. The presence of scoliosis in NF1 patients increases the risks for certain brain neoplasms and disorders but serves a protective effect against some pulmonary and cardiac complications."

Patients are reported in the literature with NF1 and cherubism-like phenotype due to the NF1 osseous lesions in the jaws. The purpose of this case report is the description of a young male genetically diagnosed with both NF1 and cherubism. A 9 years and six month old patient with clinical findings of NF1 and cherubism in whom both diseases were genetically confirmed, is presented. The patient was evaluated by a pediatrician, a pediatric endocrinologist, an ophthalmologist, and an oral and maxillofacial surgeon. A laboratory and hormonal screening, a histological examination, a chest X-ray, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the orbit and a digital panoramic radiography were performed. Genetic testing applying Whole Exome Sequencing was conducted. A novel and an already reported pathogenic variants were detected in NF1 and SH3BP2 genes, respectively. This is the first described patient with coexistence of NF1 and cherubism. The contribution of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) in gene variant identification as well as the importance of close collaboration between laboratory scientists and clinicians, is highlighted.

    "title": "Breast density in NF1 women: a retrospective study.",
    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant condition caused by neurofibromin haploinsufficiency due to pathogenic variants in the NF1 gene. Tumor predisposition has long been associated with NF1, and an increased breast cancer (BC) incidence and reduced survival have been reported in recent years for women with NF1. As breast density is another known independent risk factor for BC, this study aims to evaluate the variability of breast density in patients with NF1 compared to the general population. Mammograms from 98 NF1 women affected by NF1, and enrolled onto our monocentric BC screening program, were compared with those from 300 healthy subjects to verify differences in breast density. Mammograms were independently reviewed and scored by a radiologist and using a Computer-Aided Detection (CAD) software. The comparison of breast density between NF1 patients and controls was performed through Chi-squared test and with multivariable ordinal logistic models adjusted for age, body mass index (BMI), number of pregnancies, and menopausal status.breast density was influenced by BMI and menopausal status in both NF1 patients and healthy subjects. No difference in breast density was observed between NF1 patients and the healthy female population, even after considering the potential confounding factors.Although NF1 and a highly fibroglandular breast are known risk factors of BC, in this study, NF1 patients were shown to have comparable breast density to healthy subjects. The presence of pathogenic variants in the NF1 gene does not influence the breast density value."

    "title": "Epilepsy in Legius syndrome: Coincidence or causation?",
    "abstract": "Legius syndrome is a rare genetic disorder, caused by heterozygous SPRED1 pathogenic variants, which shares phenotypic features with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Both conditions typically involve café-au-lait macules, axillary freckling, and macrocephaly; however, patients with NF1 are also at risk for tumors, such as optic nerve gliomas and neurofibromas. Seizure risk is known to be elevated in NF1, but there has been little study of this aspect of Legius syndrome. The reported epilepsy incidence is 3.3%-5%, well above the general population incidence of ~0.5%-1%, but the few reports in the literature have very little data regarding epilepsy phenotype. We identified two unrelated individuals, both with Legius syndrome and epilepsy, and performed thorough phenotyping. One individual's mother also had Legius syndrome and now-resolved childhood epilepsy, as well as reports of more distant relatives who also had multiple café-au-lait macules and seizures. Both probands had experienced childhood-onset focal seizures, with normal brain MRI. In one patient, EEG later showed apparently generalized epileptiform abnormalities. Based on the data from this small case series and literature review, seizure risk is increased in people with Legius syndrome, but the epilepsy prognosis appears to be generally good, with patients having either self-limited or pharmacoresponsive courses."

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a complex, multisystem disorder that is characterized, among other features, by a higher risk of developing benign and malignant tumors. Despite NF1 being one of the most common autosomal dominant genetic disorders, data from adult individuals in several world regions remain elusive, including Hispanics. The present is a retrospective cohort study conducted among adult patients with a confirmed diagnosis of NF1 who attended a single cancer-reference center, the Instituto Nacional de Cancerología in Mexico City from 2001 to 2021. Data were extracted from electronic health records and collected in an anonymous database by an NF1-expert physician in order to obtain demographic characteristics and detailed information regarding the development of tumors among this patient subgroup. All patients with malignant tumors or with benign tumors, which severely affected their quality of life, were included in this study. Patient records were reviewed from 2001 to 2021. A total of <i>N</i> = 29 patients met the criteria, with a higher proportion of female compared with male subjects [<i>N</i> = 22 (75.9%) vs. <i>N</i> = 7 (24.1%)]. Patients had a mean age at diagnosis of tumors of 32.2 years (<i>SD</i> = 11.2 years). In terms of malignant neoplasms, the most frequent malignant tumor presented by patients in this cohort was malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (<i>N</i> = 7, 24.1%), this was followed by breast cancer (<i>n</i> = 4, 13.8% among all patients, 18.2% among female patients). Other tumors also identified in this cohort included melanoma, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, and rectal cancer. In Mexico, patients diagnosed with NF1 develop diverse tumors as adults. As described in other studies, the most frequent malignant tumor in this patient population is the malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor. Further studies are required to increase the scarce information available for adult Hispanics with NF1."

    "abstract": "A 60-year-old woman with a history of neurofibromatosis type 1, who was admitted with pulmonary hypertension, developed buttock pain and anemia, and contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed a large subcutaneous hematoma with minimal active extravasation. Angiography of the bilateral internal iliac arteries revealed diffuse, irregular blood vessels without extravasation. As the exact bleeding site could not be identified, the patient was managed conservatively. However, the patient's symptoms and anemia worsened the following day. Repeat angiography revealed two pseudoaneurysms in the right inferior gluteal artery, which were embolized using n-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate. Nonetheless, the patient's anemia further worsened the following day. Repeat contrast-enhanced CT revealed another site of extravasation in the enlarging hematoma, but no extravasation was observed on the subsequent angiography. Owing to the worsening anemia and enlarging hematoma, proximal embolization of the irregular bilateral inferior gluteal arteries was performed using gelatin sponge particles. The patient's anemia and symptoms improved. Vasculopathy associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 is rare, with an incidence of approximately 3%. In patients with neurofibromatosis type 1, the blood vessels become fragile because of tunica media thinning and elastic-lamina rupture. Histopathologically, neurofibromatosis type 1-associated vasculopathy is characterized by a mixture of normal and abnormal vessels. Abnormally fragile blood vessels may repeatedly rupture followed by physiological hemostasis, which may explain the diagnostic and therapeutic challenges during angiography in this case. In patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 with acute bleeding, irregular vessels without active extravasation on angiography may be indicated for embolization."

    "abstract": "Pain of unknown etiology is frequent in individuals with the tumor predisposition syndrome neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1), even when tumors are absent. Nerve Schwann cells (SCs) were recently shown to play roles in nociceptive processing, and we find that chemogenetic activation of SCs is sufficient to induce afferent and behavioral mechanical hypersensitivity in wild-type mice. In mouse models, animals showed afferent and behavioral hypersensitivity when SCs, but not neurons, lacked Nf1. Importantly, hypersensitivity corresponded with SC-specific upregulation of mRNA encoding glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), independently of the presence of tumors. Neuropathic pain-like behaviors in the NF1 mice were inhibited by either chemogenetic silencing of SC calcium or by systemic delivery of GDNF-targeting antibodies. Together, these findings suggest that alterations in SCs directly modulate mechanical pain and suggest cell-specific treatment strategies to ameliorate pain in individuals with NF1."

    "abstract": "Choroidal abnormalities (CAs) visualized on near-infrared reflectance (NIR) imaging are a new diagnostic criterion for neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), but the association between the presence of CAs and visual function remains unknown. This study evaluated the relationship between visual acuity (VA) with the presence, number, or total area of CAs visualized by NIR in children with NF1-associated optic pathway gliomas (NF1-OPGs). Patients (<18 years) enrolled in a prospective longitudinal study of children with NF1-associated OPGs from 3 institutions were eligible if they had optical coherence tomography (OCT) of the macula (Heidelberg Spectralis) with ≥1 year of follow-up. The central 30° NIR images were reviewed by 2 neuro-ophthalmologists who manually calculated the number and total area of CAs. VA (logMAR) was measured using a standardized protocol. Cross-sectional associations of presence, number, and total area of CAs with VA, retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (RNFL), and ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer thickness were evaluated at the first and most recent visits using regression models. Intereye correlation was accounted for using generalized estimating equations. Eighty-two eyes of 41 children (56% female) were included. The mean ± SD age at the first OCT was 10.1 ± 3.3 years, with a mean follow-up of 20.4 ± 7.2 months. At study entry, CAs were present in 46% of eyes with a mean number of 2.1 ± 1.7 and a mean total area of 2.0 ± 1.7 mm 2 per eye. At the most recent follow-up, CAs were present in 48% of eyes with a mean number of 2.2 ± 1.8 lesions and a mean total area of 2.3 ± 2.1 mm 2 per eye. Neither VA nor OCT parameters at first and follow-up visits were associated with the presence, number, or total area of CAs (all P > 0.05). CAs are prevalent but not ubiquitous, in children with NF1-OPGs. Although CAs are a diagnostic criterion for NF1, their presence and size do not appear to be associated with visual function."

    "abstract": "Melanoma and neurofibromatosis (NF) are distinctly separate conditions, each characterized by unique pathophysiological processes. Nevertheless, their clinical presentations can share overlapping similarities. This report highlights a unique case involving a 68-year-old male with NF1 and lipomatosis, whose unwavering belief that a developing mass in the masseter region was benign and linked to the pre-existing diagnoses contributed to a significant delay in seeking healthcare. Consequently, this postponement resulted in the late diagnosis of disseminated malignant melanoma (stage IV, T4N0M1c). Given the patient's prognosis and poor general health, a palliative treatment plan was devised, entailing the complete excision of the masseteric mass and vertebral radiotherapy. Following a rapid and extensive progression of the cancerous lesions, the patient passed away in a palliative care infirmary four months after surgery. The significance of this case, justified not only by its uncommon presentation and atypical differential diagnosis, highlights the critical necessity of regular follow-up protocols for melanoma patients, particularly those prone to metastasis, while ensuring patient attendance. Furthermore, it underscores the necessity of patient education, particularly in recognizing early signs and symptoms, and timely intervention in cases with complex comorbidities."

CP affects quality of life and daily functioning, yet there are limited effective treatments for CP within NF1. The current study describes the impact of CP using the Neurofibromatosis Pain Module (NFPM). The NFPM is a self-reported clinical assessment that evaluates the impact of CP across multiple domains (e.g., interference, severity, tolerance, and symptomology) and three prioritized pain regions. A cross-sectional study (N = 242) asked adults with NF1 to describe and rate their pain using the NFPM. The results indicated that they reported moderate pain severity (M = 6.6, SD = 2.0) on a 0-10 scale, that 54% (n = 131) had been in pain at least 24 days in the last 30, for 75% (n = 181) sleep was affected, and 16% reported that nothing was effective in reducing their CP for their primary pain region. The current results extend previously published work on CP within adults with NF1 and indicate that more emphasis on understanding and ameliorating CP is required. The NFPM is a sensitive clinical measure that provides qualitative and quantitative responses to inform medical providers about changes in CP."

In contrast to their male counterparts, female Nf1<sup>OPG</sup> mice have increased expression of glial interleukin-1β (IL-1β), which is neurotoxic to RGCs in vitro. Importantly, both IL-1β neutralization and leuprolide-mediated estrogen suppression decrease IL-1β expression and ameliorate RGC dysfunction, providing preclinical proof-of-concept evidence supporting novel neuroprotective strategies for NF1-OPG-induced vision loss."

We have screened 29 unrelated individuals who fulfilled the clinical criteria of NF1. Whole exome sequencing (WES) was done in all individuals except one with suspected microdeletion syndrome with NF1 in whom Cytogenetic microarray (CMA) was done. Out of 29 suspected patients, 25 had germline pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants involving <i>NF1</i> gene. Five novel and 20 known variants in coding and non-coding regions were identified, among them 7 variants were deletions (28%), 7 nonsense (28%), 3 splice-site (12%), 4 missense (16%), 2 duplications (8%) and 2 (8%) were contiguous deletions. In those where NF1 variants were not detected, 3 had neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) and 1 rare autosomal recessive form of Elher Danlos syndrome. We hereby present the wide range of manifestations in different age groups and the mutation spectrum ranging from small scale variants to contiguous gene deletion syndromes involving <i>NF1</i> gene. We highlight the usefulness of molecular testing and its importance in tumor surveillance and genetic counseling in this disorder."

    "abstract": "To summarize the gene therapy strategies for neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and related research progress. The recent literature on gene therapy for NF1 at home and abroad was reviewed. The structure and function of the NF1 gene and its mutations were analyzed, and the current status as well as future prospects of the transgenic therapy and gene editing strategies were summarized. NF1 is an autosomal dominantly inherited tumor predisposition syndrome caused by mutations in the NF1 tumor suppressor gene, which impair the function of the neurofibromin and lead to the disease. It has complex clinical manifestations and is not yet curable. Gene therapy strategies for NF1 are still in the research and development stage. Existing studies on the transgenic therapy for NF1 have mainly focused on the construction and expression of the GTPase-activating protein-related domain in cells that lack of functional neurofibromin, confirming the feasibility of the transgenic therapy for NF1. Future research may focus on split adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene delivery, oversized AAV gene delivery, and the development of new vectors for targeted delivery of full-length NF1 cDNA. In addition, the gene editing tools of the new generation have great potential to treat monogenic genetic diseases such as NF1, but need to be further validated in terms of efficiency and safety. Gene therapy, including both the transgenic therapy and gene editing, is expected to become an important new therapeutic approach for NF1 patients."

The most common type of tumor seen in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 is the slow-growing and benign neurofibroma, with a subtype called plexiform neurofibroma being particularly common and causing pain, functional impairment, and cosmetic disfigurement. We report the case of a 20-year-old North African female patient with a history of neurofibromatosis type 1 who presented with a growing mass in her right gluteal region, which was later diagnosed as a giant cutaneous neurofibroma. Imaging studies revealed infiltration in several regions, including the urinary bladder wall, resulting in significant bilateral hydronephrosis. The patient is currently being monitored, and no excisional procedures are planned. Neurofibromatosis type 1 can cause a variety of clinical symptoms, including the development of large plexiform neurofibromas.

Functional interactions between NF1 and NF2 and broader mechanisms underlying malignant transformation of the Schwann lineage are unclear. Here we integrate bulk and single-cell genomics, biochemistry, and pharmacology across human samples, cell lines, and mouse allografts to identify cellular de-differentiation mechanisms driving malignant transformation and treatment resistance. We find DNA methylation groups of Schwann cell tumors can be distinguished by differentiation programs that correlate with response to the MEK inhibitor selumetinib. Functional genomic screening in NF1-mutant tumor cells reveals NF2 loss and PAK activation underlie selumetinib resistance, and we find that concurrent MEK and PAK inhibition is effective in vivo. These data support a de-differentiation paradigm underlying malignant transformation and treatment resistance of Schwann cell tumors and elucidate a functional link between NF1 and NF2."

    "abstract": "NF1 is a tumor suppressor gene and its protein product, neurofibromin, is a negative regulator of the RAS pathway. NF1 is one of the top driver mutations in sporadic breast cancer such that 27 % of breast cancers exhibit damaging NF1 alterations. NF1 loss-of-function is a frequent event in the genomic evolution of estrogen receptor (ER)+ breast cancer metastasis and endocrine resistance. Individuals with Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF) - a disorder caused by germline NF1 mutations - have an increased risk of dying from breast cancer [1-4]. NF-related breast cancers are associated with decreased overall survival compared to sporadic breast cancer. Despite numerous studies interrogating the role of RAS mutations in tumor metabolism, no study has comprehensively profiled the NF1-deficient breast cancer metabolome to define patterns of energetic and metabolic reprogramming. The goals of this investigation were (1) to define the role of NF1 deficiency in estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer metabolic reprogramming and (2) to identify potential targeted pathway and metabolic inhibitor combination therapies for NF1-deficient ER + breast cancer. We employed two ER+ NF1-deficient breast cancer models: (1) an NF1-deficient MCF7 breast cancer cell line to model sporadic breast cancer, and (2) three distinct, Nf1-deficient rat models to model NF-related breast cancer [1]. IncuCyte proliferation analysis was used to measure the effect of NF1 deficiency on cell proliferation and drug response. Protein quantity was assessed by Western Blot analysis. We then used RNAseq to investigate the transcriptional effect of NF1 deficiency on global and metabolism-related transcription. We measured cellular energetics using Agilent Seahorse XF-96 Glyco Stress Test and Mito Stress Test assays. We performed stable isotope labeling and measured [U-<sup>13</sup>C]-glucose and [U-<sup>13</sup>C]-glutamine metabolite incorporation and measured total metabolite pools using mass spectrometry. Lastly, we used a Bliss synergy model to investigate NF1-driven changes in targeted and metabolic inhibitor synergy. Our results revealed that NF1 deficiency enhanced cell proliferation, altered neurofibromin expression, and increased RAS and PI3K/AKT pathway signaling while constraining oxidative ATP production and restricting energetic flexibility. Neurofibromin deficiency also increased glutamine influx into TCA intermediates and dramatically increased lipid pools, especially triglycerides (TG). Lastly, NF1 deficiency alters the synergy between metabolic inhibitors and traditional targeted inhibitors. This includes increased synergy with inhibitors targeting glycolysis, glutamine metabolism, mitochondrial fatty acid transport, and TG synthesis. NF1 deficiency drives metabolic reprogramming in ER+ breast cancer. This reprogramming is characterized by oxidative ATP constraints, glutamine TCA influx, and lipid pool expansion, and these metabolic changes introduce novel metabolic-to-targeted inhibitor synergies."

The NIH Toolbox Flanker and Cogstate Identification tasks detected the highest proportion of participants with at least mild difficulty, and the Cogstate Identification task detected the highest proportion of participants with severe difficulty. Analyses revealed significant relations with ADHD symptomatology for two NIH toolbox tasks. The various computerized measures of attention and executive function offer different information when working with school age children with NF1. The NIH Flanker may offer the most room for change and offers face validity, which may be beneficial for clinical trials research.

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) stands as a prevalent neurocutaneous disorder. Approximately a quarter of NF1 patients experience the development of plexiform neurofibromas, potentially progressing into malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST). FT895, an HDAC11 inhibitor, exhibits potent anti-tumor effects on MPNST cells and enhances the cytotoxicity of cordycepin against MPNST. The study aims to investigate the molecular mechanism underlying FT895's efficacy against MPNST cells. Initially, our study unveiled that FT895 disrupts mitochondrial biogenesis and function. Post-FT895 treatment, reactive oxygen species (ROS) in MPNST notably increased, while mitochondrial DNA copy numbers decreased significantly. Seahorse analysis indicated a considerable decrease in basal, maximal, and ATP-production-coupled respiration following FT895 treatment. Immunostaining highlighted FT895's role in promoting mitochondrial aggregation without triggering mitophagy, possibly due to reduced levels of XBP1, Parkin, and PINK1 proteins. Moreover, the study using CHIP-qPCR analysis revealed a significant reduction in the copy numbers of promoters of the MPV17L2, POLG, TFAM, PINK1, and Parkin genes. The RNA-seq analysis underscored the prominent role of the HIF-1α signaling pathway post-FT895 treatment, aligning with the observed impairment in mitochondrial respiration. In summary, the study pioneers the revelation that FT895 induces mitochondrial respiratory damage in MPNST cells."

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a disorder in which RAS is constitutively activated due to the loss of the Ras-GTPase-activating activity of neurofibromin. RAS must be prenylated (i.e., farnesylated or geranylgeranylated) to traffic and function properly. Previous studies showed that the anti-growth properties of farnesyl monophosphate prodrug farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTIs) on human NF1 malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) cells are potentiated by co-treatment with lovastatin. Unfortunately, such prodrug FTIs have poor aqueous solubility. In this study, we synthesized a series of prodrug FTI polyamidoamine generation 4 (PAMAM G4) dendrimers that compete with farnesyl pyrophosphate for farnesyltransferase (Ftase) and assessed their effects on human NF1 MPNST S462TY cells. The prodrug 3-tert-butylfarnesyl monophosphate FTI-dendrimer (i.e., <b>IG 2</b>) exhibited improved aqueous solubility. Concentrations of <b>IG 2</b> and lovastatin (as low as 0.1 μM) having little to no effect when used singularly synergistically suppressed cell proliferation, colony formation, and induced N-RAS, RAP1A, and RAB5A deprenylation when used in combination. Combinational treatment had no additive or synergistic effects on the proliferation/viability of immortalized normal rat Schwann cells, primary rat hepatocytes, or normal human mammary epithelial MCF10A cells. Combinational, but not singular, in vivo treatment markedly suppressed the growth of S462TY xenografts established in the sciatic nerves of immune-deficient mice. Hence, prodrug farnesyl monophosphate FTIs can be rendered water-soluble by conjugation to PAMAM G4 dendrimers and exhibit potent anti-tumor activity when combined with clinically achievable statin concentrations."

    "abstract": "Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are malignancies that demonstrate nerve sheath differentiation in the peripheral nervous system. They can occur sporadically or be associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), an autosomal dominant neurocutaneous disorder, with up to 13% of patients developing MPNSTs in their lifetimes. Previous studies have suggested conflicting findings regarding the prognosis of NF1 for patients with MPNSTs. The elucidation of NF1 as an independent prognostic factor on mortality has implications for clinical management. We aim to investigate the role of NF1 status as an independent prognostic factor of overall survival (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) in MPNSTs. An electronic literature search of PubMed and MEDLINE was performed on studies reporting OS or DSS outcomes of MPNSTs with and without NF1. A grey literature search by reviewing bibliographies of included studies and review articles was performed to find pertinent studies. Data was extracted and assessed in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. A meta-analysis was performed to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) using a random-effects model. The primary and secondary outcomes were all-cause and disease-specific mortality, respectively, with NF1 as an independent prognostic factor of interest. A total of 59 retrospective studies involving 3602 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria for OS analysis, and 23 studies involving 704 MPNST patients were included to evaluate DSS outcomes. There was a significant increase in the hazard of all-cause mortality (HR 1.63, 95% CI 1.45 to 1.84) and disease-specific mortality (HR 1.52, 95% CI 1.24 to 1.88) among NF1 as compared to sporadic cases. Subgroup analyses and meta-regression showed that this result was consistent regardless of the quality of the study and year of publication. NF1 is associated with a substantially higher risk of all-cause and disease-specific mortality. This finding suggests that closer surveillance is required for NF1 patients at risk of developing MPNSTs."

A 72-year-old female who received radiotherapy 30 years ago for cervical cancer was admitted with progressive abdominal pain and weight loss. Computed tomography revealed a mass with inhomogeneous enhancement in the lumen of the small intestine. Tumour excision was performed with ileocecal and sigmoid colon resection due to suspicion for peripheral tissue invasion. Histopathological examination revealed spindle-shaped cells with focal cartilage differentiation. Together with immunochemistry stain showing complete loss of H3K27me3, a final diagnosis of MPNST was made. The patient is presently under regular follow-ups, and has remained disease-free for 24 months."

    "title": "Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) and MPNST-like entities are defined by a specific DNA methylation profile in pediatric and juvenile population.",
    "abstract": "Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) account for 3-10% of pediatric sarcomas, 50% of which occur in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Sporadic MPNSTs diagnosis may be challenging due to the absence of specific markers, apart from immunohistochemical H3K27me3 loss. DNA methylation (DNAm) profiling is a useful tool for brain and mesenchymal neoplasms categorization, and MPNSTs exhibit a specific DNAm signature. An MPNST-like group has recently been recognized, including pediatric tumors with retained H3K27me3 mark and clinical/histological features not yet well explored. This study aims to characterize the DNAm profile of pediatric/juvenile MPNSTs/MPNST-like entities and its diagnostic/prognostic relevance. We studied 42 tumors from two groups. Group 1 included 32 tumors histologically diagnosed as atypical neurofibroma (ANF) (N = 5) or MPNST (N = 27); group 2 comprised 10 tumors classified as MPNST-like according to Heidelberg sarcoma classifier. We performed further immunohistochemical and molecular tests to reach an integrated diagnosis. In group 1, DNAm profiling was inconclusive for ANF; while, it confirmed the original diagnosis in 12/27 MPNSTs, all occurring in NF1 patients. Five/27 MPNSTs were classified as MPNST-like: Integrated diagnosis confirmed MPNST identity for 3 cases; while, the immunophenotype supported the change to high-grade undifferentiated spindle cell sarcoma in 2 samples. The remaining 10/27 MPNSTs variably classified as schwannoma, osteosarcoma, BCOR-altered sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS)-MYOD1 mutant, RMS-like, and embryonal RMS or did not match with any defined entity. Molecular analysis and histologic review confirmed the diagnoses of BCOR, RMS-MYOD1 mutant, DICER1-syndrome and ERMS. Group 2 samples included 5 high-grade undifferentiated sarcomas/MPNSTs and 5 low-grade mesenchymal neoplasms. Two high-grade and 4 low-grade lesions harbored tyrosine kinase (TRK) gene fusions. By HDBSCAN clustering analysis of the whole cohort we identified two clusters mainly distinguished by H3K27me3 epigenetic signature. Exploring the copy number variation, high-grade tumors showed frequent chromosomal aberrations and CDKN2A/B loss significantly impacted on survival in the MPNSTs cohort. DNAm profiling is a useful tool in diagnostic work-up of MPNSTs. Its application in a retrospective series collected during pre-molecular era contributed to classify morphologic mimics. The methylation group MPNST-like is a 'hybrid' category in pediatrics including high-grade and low-grade tumors mainly characterized by TRK alterations."

    "title": "Unbalancing cAMP and Ras/MAPK pathways as a therapeutic strategy for cutaneous neurofibromas.",
    "abstract": "Cutaneous neurofibromas (cNFs) are benign Schwann cell (SC) tumors arising from subepidermal glia. Individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) may develop thousands of cNFs, which greatly affect their quality of life. cNF growth is driven by the proliferation of NF1-/- SCs and their interaction with the NF1+/- microenvironment. We analyzed the crosstalk between human cNF-derived SCs and fibroblasts (FBs), identifying an expression signature specific to the SC-FB interaction. We validated the secretion of proteins involved in immune cell migration, suggesting a role of SC-FB crosstalk in immune cell recruitment. The signature also captured components of developmental signaling pathways, including the cAMP elevator G protein-coupled receptor 68 (GPR68). Activation of Gpr68 by ogerin in combination with the MEK inhibitor (MEKi) selumetinib reduced viability and induced differentiation and death of human cNF-derived primary SCs, a result corroborated using an induced pluripotent stem cell-derived 3D neurofibromasphere model. Similar results were obtained using other Gpr68 activators or cAMP analogs/adenylyl cyclase activators in combination with selumetinib. Interestingly, whereas primary SC cultures restarted their proliferation after treatment with selumetinib alone was stopped, the combination of ogerin-selumetinib elicited a permanent halt on SC expansion that persisted after drug removal. These results indicate that unbalancing the Ras and cAMP pathways by combining MEKi and cAMP elevators could be used as a potential treatment for cNFs."

    "abstract": "Plexiform neurofibromas (PNs) are peripheral nerve tumors that occur in 25-50 % of patients with neurofibromatosis type 1. PNs may have complex, diffused, and irregular shapes. The objective of this work was to develop a volumetric quantification method for PNs as clinical assessment is currently based on unidimensional measurement. A semi-automatic segmentation technique based on mean magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) intensity thresholding (SSTMean) was developed and compared to a similar and previously published technique based on minimum image intensity thresholding (SSTMini). The performance (volume and computation time) of the two techniques was compared to manual tracings of 15 tumors of different locations, shapes, and sizes. Performance was also assessed using different MRI sequences. Reproducibility was assessed by inter-observer analysis. When compared to manual tracing, quantification performed with SSTMean was not significantly different (mean difference: 1.2 %), while volumes computed by SSTMini were significantly different (p < .0001, mean difference: 13.4 %). Volumes quantified by SSTMean were also significantly different than the ones assessed by SSTMini (p < .0001). Using SSTMean, volumes quantified with short TI inversion recovery, T1-, and T2-weighted imaging were not significantly different. Computation times used by SSTMean and SSTMini were significantly lower than for manual segmentation (p < .0001). The highest difference measured by two users was 8 cm<sup>3</sup>. Our method showed accuracy compared to a current gold standard (manual tracing) and reproducibility between users. The refined segmentation threshold and the possibility to define multiple regions-of-interest to initiate segmentation may have contributed to its performance. The versatility and speed of our method may prove useful to better monitor volumetric changes in lesions of patients enrolled in clinical trials to assessing response to therapy."

Data from 860 children, ages 8-17, with a diagnosis of epilepsy, pNF (neurofibromatosis type 1 associated neurofibroma plexform), MD (muscular dystrophy), cancer, or skin conditions recruited from three projects were analyzed. Children with epilepsy, pNF and MD (sample-1) completed the original 18-item Neuro-QoL Stigma, while children with cancer and skin conditions (e.g., atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, and genetic skin disorders; sample-2) completed a 16-item version and 6 additional skin related items. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory analysis (CFA) were used to evaluate unidimensionality of 24 stigma items. Differential item functioning (DIF) was used to evaluate measurement equivalence on group, gender, age, and conditions. Item response theory model (IRT) was used to construct the final measure. Sufficient unidimensionality was supported by both EFA and CFA. No items showed significant DIF indicating stable measurement properties across groups of comparison. All items fit the IRT model and were able to be calibrated together to form the PPS which consists of 18 core items. The PPS-Skin (18 cores items + 6 skin items) was developed by calibrating 6 skin items onto the common metric as the PPS. We used IRT techniques to successfully develop the PPS and the PPS-Skin, which share a common metric and account for unique and common concerns related to chronic conditions."

    "abstract": "Acute ischemic stroke is an uncommon presentation in the pediatric population as compared to the elderly population. COVID-19 infection is associated with several neurological manifestations, with ischemic strokes being underrecognized. Cerebrovascular events associated with COVID-19 may be due to systemic inflammation and hypercoagulable state. Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an inherited multisystem disorder caused by dominant loss-of-function mutations of the tumor-suppressor gene neurofibromin 1, which is located at 17q11.2.1. NF1 is associated with multiple cerebrovascular abnormalities, including internal carotid artery occlusion. A review of the current literature on manifestations of COVID-19 in the pediatric population, including stroke and seizures, is also provided in this case report. A brief review of the literature on neurofibromatosis and the risk of stroke as well as other clinical manifestations is also included as a part of this case report. This case illustrates the importance of recognizing acute and rare complications of neurofibromatosis. Cerebral vasculopathy is an important but underrecognized complication of NF1. Children with neurofibromatosis and hypertension require a thorough and complete neurologic evaluation. This case describes a young infant with a delayed clinical diagnosis of NF1 who was presented with viral manifestations of COVID-19 infection and was diagnosed with a large middle cerebral artery stroke."

We performed an exploratory study on the longitudinal volumetric course of different (intra-)tumor components by manual segmentation of MRI at the start and after 3, 6 and 12 months of bevacizumab (BVZ) treatment. Thirty-one patients were treated with BVZ (median 12 months, range: 2-39 months). During treatment the total tumor volume decreased with median 19.9% (range: - 62.3 to + 29.7%; n = 30) within the first 3 months, decreased 19.0% (range: - 68.8 to + 96.1%; n = 28) between start and 6 months and 27.2% (range: -73.4 to + 36.0%; n = 21) between start and 12 months. Intra-tumoral cysts were present in 12 OPGs, all showed a decrease of volume during treatment. The relative contrast enhanced volume of NF1 associated OPG (n = 11) showed an significant reduction compared to OPG with a KIAA1549-BRAF fusion (p < 0.01). Three OPGs progressed during treatment, but were not preceded by an increase of relative contrast enhancement. Treatment with BVZ of progressive pediatric OPGs leads to a decrease of both total tumor volume and cystic volume for the majority of OPGs with emphasis on the first three months. NF1 and KIAA1549-BRAF fusion related OPGs showed a different (early) treatment effect regarding the tumor enhancing component on MRI, which did not correlate with tumor volume changes. Future research is necessary to further evaluate these findings and its relevance to clinical outcome parameters."

They can affect any bone structure and be single or multiple. They are usually located on the long bones, pelvis, ribs, and collarbones. Facial localization is rare and is found in only 4.5% of brown tumors dominated by mandibular involvement. The treatment of a brown tumor depends on several elements: etiology, location, and symptomatology. It can regress or disappear after the treatment of hyperparathyroidism, thus avoiding surgical removal. Otherwise, excision of this mass is performed. We illustrate through this case a brown mandibular tumor revealing secondary hyperparathyroidism in a patient with a history of end-stage chronic renal failure on hemodialysis and associated neurofibromatosis type 1."

    "abstract": "The co-occurrence of moyamoya vasculopathy and extra-optic pathway tumors is rare in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), with only four cases described in the literature. Brain surgery in these patients may be challenging because of the risk of brain infarction after skin and dural incision. Given its percutaneous and minimally invasive nature, laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) is an ideal option for the treatment of brain tumors in these patients. Here, we report on two patients with NF1 and moyamoya syndrome (MMS) treated for a brain glioma with LITT, after cerebral revascularization. The first patient, with familial NF1, underwent bilateral indirect revascularization with multiple burr holes (MBH) for symptomatic MMS. Two years later, she was diagnosed with a left temporal tumor, with evidence of radiologic progression over 10 months. The second patient, also with familial NF1, developed unilateral MMS when he was 6 years old and was treated with MBH. At the age of 15 years, MRI showed a right cingular lesion, growing on serial MRIs. Both patients underwent LITT with no perioperative complications; they are progression free at 10 and 12 months, respectively, and the tumors have decreased in volume. While the association of extra-optic neoplasm and moyamoya angiopathy is seldom reported in NF1, tumor treatment is challenging in terms of both avoiding stroke and achieving oncological control. Here, we show in 2 cases, that LITT could be a safe and effective option in these rare conditions."

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a genetic autosomal neurocutaneous syndrome correlated with skeletal dysplasia and defects in the osseous microarchitecture. The physiological mechanism for the development of NF1-related bone abnormal turnover is still unclear. A meta-analysis was performed to investigate the effects of NF1 on bone mineral density (BMD) and osseous metabolic indices in order to provide clinical evidence for the pathogenesis of the associated skeletal deformities. A systematic literature review search was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines in the PubMed/Medline and Web of Science databases from the date of inception of each database through to 10 September 2023. Specific inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied for the identification of studies examining the effects of NF1 on bone strength and metabolism. The Newcastle-Ottawa and Jadad scales were applied to assess the quality of the included studies. RevMan 5.3 software was used for the analysis of the data, and MedCalc was applied to examine publication bias. Overall, 13 studies met the inclusion criteria comprised of 5 cross-sectional, 6 case-control and 2 retrospective studies. 703 patients and 973 healthy subjects formed the NF1 and control group, respectively. The results of the meta-analysis displayed that lumbar (SMD = -3.85, 95%CI = -7.53 to -0.18, Z = 2.05, p = 0.04) and femoral (SMD = -4.78, 95%CI = -8.86 to -0.69, Z = 2.29, p = 0.02) BMD was reduced in the NF1 group. Both in children and adults the serum levels of 25 hydroxyvitamin D3 were also decreased in NF1 group, but without any statistical significance (SMD = -0.62, 95%CI = -1.34 to -0.11, Z = 1.66, p = 0.10).

NF1 is associated with decreased BMD at the lumbar spine and femur. Taking into account that the serum levels of PTH, CTX were increased whereas the concentrations of vitamin D, calcium, phosphorous, ALP, osteocalcin and bone formation markers were not altered significantly in the NF1 patients compared with the healthy subjects, a vitamin D independent dysregulated bone cellular activity could be considered.

    "abstract": "Individuals with neurofibromatosis 1 may experience changes in their appearance due to physical manifestations of the disorders and/or treatment sequelae. Appearance concerns related to these physical changes can lead to psychological distress and poorer quality of life. While many neurofibromatosis 1 clinical trials focus on assessing changes in tumor volume, evaluating patients' perspectives on corresponding changes in symptoms such as physical appearance can be key secondary outcomes. We aimed to determine whether any existing patient-reported outcome measures are appropriate for evaluating changes in appearance concerns within neurofibromatosis 1 clinical trials. After updating our previously published systematic review process, we used it to identify and rate existing patient-reported outcome measures related to disfigurement and appearance. Using a systematic literature search and initial triage process, we focused on identifying patient-reported outcome measures that could be used to evaluate changes in appearance concerns in plexiform or cutaneous neurofibroma clinical trials in neurofibromatosis 1. Our revised Patient-Reported Outcome Rating and Acceptance Tool for Endpoints then was used to evaluate each published patient-reported outcome measures in five domains, including (1) respondent characteristics, (2) content validity, (3) scoring format and interpretability, (4) psychometric data, and (5) feasibility. The highest-rated patient-reported outcome measures were then re-reviewed in a side-by-side comparison to generate a final consensus recommendation. Eleven measures assessing appearance concerns were reviewed and rated; no measures were explicitly designed to assess appearance concerns related to neurofibromatosis 1. The FACE-Q Craniofacial Module-Appearance Distress scale was the top-rated measure for potential use in neurofibromatosis 1 clinical trials. Strengths of the measure included that it was rigorously developed, included individuals with neurofibromatosis 1 in the validation sample, was applicable to children and adults, covered item topics deemed important by neurofibromatosis 1 patient representatives, exhibited good psychometric properties, and was feasible for use in neurofibromatosis 1 trials. Limitations included a lack of validation in older adults, no published information regarding sensitivity to change in clinical trials, and limited availability in languages other than English. The Response Evaluation in Neurofibromatosis and Schwannomatosis patient-reported outcome working group currently recommends the FACE-Q Craniofacial Module Appearance Distress scale to evaluate patient-reported changes in appearance concerns in clinical trials for neurofibromatosis 1-related plexiform or cutaneous neurofibromas. Additional research is needed to validate this measure in people with neurofibromatosis 1, including older adults and those with tumors in various body locations, and explore the effects of nontumor manifestations on appearance concerns in people with neurofibromatosis 1 and schwannomatosis."

CFC syndrome overlaps with Noonan syndrome, Costello syndrome, neurofibromatosis type 1 and Legius syndrome, therefore making the diagnosis challenging. Neurological involvement in CFC is more severe than in other RASopathies. Phenotypic variability in CFC patients is related to the specific gene affected, without a recognized genotype-phenotype correlation for distinct pathogenic variants. Currently, there is no specific treatment for CFC syndrome. Encouraging zebrafish model system studies suggested that, in the future, MEK inhibitors could be a suitable treatment of progressive phenotypes of CFC in children.

    "abstract": "<i>Background</i>: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a genetic disorder characterized by heterozygous germline <i>NF1</i> gene mutations that predispose patients to developing plexiform neurofibromas, which are benign but often disfiguring tumors of the peripheral nerve sheath induced by loss of heterozygosity at the <i>NF1</i> locus. These can progress to malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs). There are no approved drug treatments for adults with NF1-related inoperable plexiform neurofibromas, and only one drug (selumetinib), which is an FDA-approved targeted therapy for the treatment of symptomatic pediatric plexiform neurofibromas, highlighting the need for additional drug screening and development. In high-throughput screening, the effectiveness of drugs against cell lines is often assessed by measuring in vitro potency (AC50) or the area under the curve (AUC). However, the variability of dose-response curves across drugs and cell lines and the frequency of partial effectiveness suggest that these measures alone fail to provide a full picture of overall efficacy. <i>Methods</i>: Using concentration-response data, we combined response effectiveness (EFF) and potency (AC50) into (a) a score characterizing the effect of a compound on a single cell line, <b><i>S</i></b> = log[EFF/AC50], and (b) a relative score, <b><i>ΔS</i></b>, characterizing the relative difference between a reference (e.g., non-tumor) and test (tumor) cell line. <b><i>ΔS</i></b> was applied to data from high-throughput screening (HTS) of a drug panel tested on <i>NF1-/-</i> tumor cells, using immortalized non-tumor <i>NF1+/-</i> cells as a reference. <i>Results</i>: We identified drugs with sensitivity, targeting expected pathways, such as MAPK-ERK and PI3K-AKT, as well as serotonin-related targets, among others.

Diagnoses of hypertension were retrieved from the Finnish Care Register for Health Care. These registered data were separately analyzed for secondary and essential hypertension. Purchases of antihypertensive drugs were queried from the Finnish Register of Reimbursed Drug Purchases. We identified 115 NF1 patients with hospital diagnosis of hypertension. Our findings revealed a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.64 (95% CI 1.34-2.00, p < 0.001) in NF1 versus controls. NF1 patients presented with a significantly increased hazard for both secondary hypertension (n = 9, HR 3.76, 95% CI 1.77-7.95, p < 0.001) and essential hypertension (n = 98, HR 1.73, 95% CI 1.39-2.14, p < 0.001).

    "abstract": "Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) are aggressive soft tissue sarcomas originating from cellular components within the nerve sheath. The incidence of MPNST is highest in people with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), and MPNST is the leading cause of death for these individuals. Complete surgical resection is the only curative therapeutic option, but is often unfeasible due to tumor location, size, or presence of metastases. Evidence-based choices of chemotherapy for recurrent/refractory MPNST remain elusive. To address this gap, we conducted a retrospective analysis of our institutional experience in treating patients with relapsed MPNST in order to describe patient outcomes related to salvage regimens. We conducted a retrospective electronic health record analysis of patients with MPNST who were treated at Johns Hopkins Hospital from January 2010 to June 2021. We calculated time to progression (TTP) based on salvage chemotherapy regimens. Sixty-five patients were included in the analysis. Upfront therapy included single or combined modalities of surgery, chemotherapy, or radiotherapy. Forty-eight patients received at least 1 line of chemotherapy, which included 23 different regimens (excluding active clinical studies). Most patients (<i>n</i> = 42, 87.5%) received a combination of doxorubicin, ifosfamide, or etoposide as first-line chemotherapy. Salvage chemotherapy regimens and their TTP varied greatly, with irinotecan/temozolomide-based regimens having the longest average TTP (255.5 days, among 4 patients). Patients with advanced or metastatic MPNST often succumb to their disease despite multiple lines of therapy.

    "abstract": "Plexiform neurofibromas (PNF) are benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors (PNST) associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Despite similar histologic appearance, these neoplasms exhibit diverse evolutionary trajectories, with a subset progressing to malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST), the leading cause of premature death in individuals with NF1. Malignant transformation of PNF often occurs through the development of atypical neurofibroma (ANF) precursor lesions characterized by distinct histopathologic features and CDKN2A copy-number loss. Although genomic studies have uncovered key driver events promoting tumor progression, the transcriptional changes preceding malignant transformation remain poorly defined. Here we resolve gene-expression profiles in PNST across the neurofibroma-to-MPNST continuum in NF1 patients and mouse models, revealing early molecular features associated with neurofibroma evolution and transformation. Our findings demonstrate that ANF exhibit enhanced signatures of antigen presentation and immune response, which are suppressed as malignant transformation ensues. MPNST further displayed deregulated survival and mitotic fidelity pathways, and targeting key mediators of these pathways, CENPF and BIRC5, disrupted the growth and viability of human MPNST cell lines and primary murine Nf1-Cdkn2a-mutant Schwann cell precursors. Finally, neurofibromas contiguous with MPNST manifested distinct alterations in core oncogenic and immune surveillance programs, suggesting that early molecular events driving disease progression may precede histopathologic evidence of malignancy. If validated prospectively in future studies, these signatures may serve as molecular diagnostic tools to augment conventional histopathologic diagnosis by identifying neurofibromas at high risk of undergoing malignant transformation, facilitating risk-adapted care."

    "title": "Clinical-radiological-pathological correlation in pulmonary hypertension with unclear and/or multifactorial mechanisms.",
    "abstract": "Ever since the second world symposium on pulmonary hypertension (PH) held in Evian, France, in 1998, PH has been classified into five major clinical groups. Group 5 PH includes a variety of distinct conditions with unclear and/or multifactorial underlying pathologies. Management of these patients is challenging as the number of patients within these groups is often small, not all individuals with certain underlying conditions are affected by PH and patients exhibit distinct symptoms due to different underlying diseases. Studies and clinical trials in these groups are largely lacking and mostly restricted to case series and registry reports. Nonetheless, the worldwide burden of group 5 PH is estimated to be significant in terms of the prevalence of some associated diseases. Group 5 PH encompasses six subgroups, including haematological disorders (inherited and acquired chronic haemolytic anaemia and chronic myeloproliferative disorders), systemic disorders (sarcoidosis, pulmonary Langerhans's cell histiocytosis and neurofibromatosis type 1), metabolic disorders (glycogen storage diseases and Gaucher disease), chronic renal failure with or without haemodialysis, pulmonary tumour thrombotic microangiopathy and fibrosing mediastinitis."

After stabilizing her vital sign, we provided the patient with image examinations and whole-exome sequencing, which revealed a heterozygous variation of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). The final diagnosis of the patient was NF1 complicated with neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (NHIE). During hospitalization, the patient received comprehensive and systematic care. There was no reports of similar cases in the literature. So, this report aimed to elucidate the special clinical manifestations, diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of NF1 complicated with NHIE by analyzing the clinical data of the patient and her family and reviewing relevant literature."

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an is an autosomal dominant heritable tumor predisposition syndrome.. Peripheral nerve sheath tumors (PNST) are a hallmark of NF1. Plexiform neurofibromas (PNF) are neoplasms that are characteristic of NF1, often causing disfiguring effects (e.g., on the face), and are considered precancerous lesions. Previous studies have shown that facial PNF (FPNF) have an impact on the shape of facial bones. This study examines deviations of mandibular symmetry from cephalometric reference planes considering the topography of FPNF. The posterior-anterior (PA) cephalograms of 168 patients with NF1 were examined. We compared three groups: patients with FPNF (n=74), with disseminated cutaneous neurofibroma (DNF (n=94)), and control subjects without NF1 (n=23). The PNF group was subtyped with respect to facial PNST type and location. Typical mandibular cephalometric reference points were determined (condyle, antegonion, and menton). The skeletal measurement points of the mandible in FPNF patients often differ significantly from those of the DNF group. It has been proven that typical asymmetries of the median-sagittal measurement points are indicators of PNF. Differences within the trigeminal tumor spread patterns are indicated in the measured values. A local tumor effect (PNF) on the relation of the measurement points to the reference planes is made plausible by the study results. The investigations prove that tumor type (FPNF) and the number of FPNF affected branches of the trigeminal nerve may correlate with significant deviations of mandible from symmetry on PA projections. The presented study shows that characteristic patterns of mandibular deformity can be measured on standardized radiographs in NF1 patients with FPNF. Mandibular deformities imaged on standardized radiographs may be initial indicators of a previously unrecognized NF1. Tumor-associated alterations of the mandible should be considered in the classification systems of pathognomonic, diagnostically pioneering osseous findings in NF1. The radiological findings provide clues for planning mandibular osteotomies in NF1 patients, especially for assessing facial regions typically highly vascularized by tumor spread. Furthermore, the radiological findings are an indication of a tumor potentially invading and destroying adjacent masticatory and mimic muscle, findings that may have an influence on surgical measures (function, aesthetics, and wound healing)."

    "abstract": "Gastrointestinal stromal tumor is considered the most common mesenchymal neoplasm of the gastrointestinal tract. The majority of gastrointestinal stromal tumor cases are located in the stomach and usually affects older adults. Most of gastrointestinal stromal tumor cases are sporadic; however, few have a syndromic association, including Carney triad, Carney-Stratakis syndrome, familial gastrointestinal stromal tumor syndrome, and neurofibromatosis type 1. Herein, we report a rare case of a 54-year-old Middle-Eastern female with multifocal gastrointestinal stromal tumor mixed type (epithelioid and spindle cell type) with osseous metaplasia. Fluoresce in situ hybridization analysis of platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha revealed deletion in 42% of the tumor cells studied. Interestingly, next generation sequencing revealed platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha exon 12 mutation (p.Y555C) and exon 14 mutation (p.N659Y). In conclusion, osseous metaplasia in GIST is a very rare event and only few cases are reported in the literature. The number of reported cases is inadequate to confirm the pathogenesis and the prognosis."

With increased understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of these tumors, more people have been identified with a cancer predisposition syndrome. Identification is crucial, as this informs surveillance, diagnosis, and treatment options. Moreover, relatives can also be identified through genetic testing. Although there are many cancer predisposition syndromes that increase the risk of NS tumors, in this review, we focus on three of the most common cancer predisposition syndromes, neurofibromatosis type 1, neurofibromatosis type 2, and tuberous sclerosis complex type 1 and type 2, emphasizing the clinical manifestations, surveillance guidelines, and treatment options."

The correlations between genotype and phenotype in NF1 remain elusive. This study aimed to elucidate genotype-phenotype associations in a large Chinese cohort of NF1 patients. We included NF1 patients from our center who underwent genetic testing for NF1 variants and systemic examination. Genotype-phenotype correlation analyses were performed, focusing on variation types and involved neurofibromin domains. A total of 195 patients were enrolled, comprising 105 males and 90 females, with a median age of 18 years. Truncating variants, single amino acid variations, and splicing variants accounted for 139/195 (71.3%), 23/195 (11.8%), and 33/195 (16.9%), respectively. Patients with splicing variants exhibited a significantly higher prevalence of spinal plexiform neurofibromas (spinal PNF) than those with truncating variants (76.4% vs. 51.8%; p = 0.022). Variations affecting the PKC domain were associated with higher rates of cutaneous neurofibromas (CNF) (100% vs. 64.9%, p < 0.001), Lisch nodules (100% vs. 61.2%, p < 0.001), plexiform neurofibromas (PNF) (100% vs. 95.7%, p = 0.009), and psychiatric disorders (11.8% vs. 1.6%, p = 0.042). Patients with mutations in the CSRD had an elevated risk of secondary primary malignancies (11.6% vs. 2.8%, p = 0.015). GRD involvement might enhance the risk of Lisch nodules (76.9% vs. 53.7%, p = 0.044). Variations in the Sec14-PH domain were correlated with a higher rate of CNF (76.8% vs. 58.6%, p = 0.014). Additionally, we found that the p.R1748* variants carry a high risk of malignancy. Our study suggested some novel genotype-phenotype correlations within a Chinese cohort, providing innovative insights into this complex field that may contribute to genetic counseling, risk stratification, and clinical management for the NF1 population."

Safety, tolerability, and efficacy of 4 different treatments were compared in 309, 2-4 mm cNFs across 19 adults with Fitzpatrick skin types (FST) I-IV: radiofrequency (RF) needle coagulation, 755 nm alexandrite laser with suction, 980 nm diode laser, and intratumoral injection of 10 mg/mL deoxycholate. Regional pain, clinical responses, tumor height and volume (by 3D photography) were assessed before, 3 and 6 months post-treatment. Biopsies were obtained electively at 3 months. There was no scarring or adverse events > grade 2. Each modality significantly (P < .05) reduced or cleared cNFs, with large variation between tumors and participants. Alexandrite laser and deoxycholate were fast and least painful; 980 nm laser was most painful. Growth of cNFs was not stimulated by treatment(s) based on height and volume values at 3 and 6 months compared to baseline. Intervention was a single treatment session; dosimetry has not been optimized. Small cNFs can be rapidly and safely treated without surgery."

While OPG size has been associated with vision loss, it is unclear how changes in size, shape, and imaging features of OPGs are associated with the likelihood of vision loss. This paper presents a fully automatic framework for accurate prediction of visual acuity loss using multi-sequence magnetic resonance images (MRIs). Our proposed framework includes a transformer-based segmentation network using transfer learning, statistical analysis of radiomic features, and a machine learning method for predicting vision loss. Our segmentation network was evaluated on multi-sequence MRIs acquired from 75 pediatric subjects with NF1-OPG and obtained an average Dice similarity coefficient of 0.791. The ability to predict vision loss was evaluated on a subset of 25 subjects with ground truth using cross-validation and achieved an average accuracy of 0.8. Analyzing multiple MRI features appear to be good indicators of vision loss, potentially permitting early treatment decisions.Clinical relevance- Accurately determining which children with NF1-OPGs are at risk and hence require preventive treatment before vision loss remains challenging, towards this we present a fully automatic deep learning-based framework for vision outcome prediction, potentially permitting early treatment decisions."

Furthermore, clinical and histopathological features of 19 cases of primary hepatic schwannoma are also documented. The age of the patients ranged from 38 to 72 years, with a mean age of 56.4 years, and the disease was more common in females. Patients typically presented without clinical symptoms and were not associated with neurofibromatosis type 1. Histopathological features of the tumor were similar to soft tissue schwannoma, characterized by a thick capsule consisting of Antoni A and Antoni B areas. Immunohistochemically, the tumor showed strong positivity and diffusely stained with S-100, while being negative for CD34, CD117, and SMA. Complete resection of the tumor was achieved in all patients. The prognosis was favorable, with no signs of recurrence. Follow-up examinations revealed disease-free survival ranging from 6 to 27 months. Differential diagnosis of primary hepatic schwannoma from malignant liver tumors and metastatic liver tumors can be made based on histopathological features and immunohistochemical staining with S-100."

Most of the cases of MAS are categorized as idiopathic; however, genetic disorders like Williams syndrome, mucopolysaccharidosis, neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), and Alagille syndrome, and acquired inflammatory diseases such as Takayasu arteritis and other nonspecific arteritis can also lead to MAS. MAS is commonly seen in children and young adults presenting with severe hypertension, congestive heart failure, renal failure, or severe leg claudication. The diagnosis of MAS on CT, MR, and conventional angiography is fairly straightforward. However, the spectrum of sonographic findings in MAS can be varied. Since ultrasound is frequently utilized as a first-line investigation for secondary causes of hypertension, it is especially crucial to understand the sonographic features of MAS.

We report three cases with unilateral flake-shaped choroidal lesions on SLO multicolor PPI, similar to choroidal NF1 lesions, monitored their evolution and analyzed their potential nature using multimodal imaging including SLO multicolor and classical PPI, infrared autofluorescence (IRAF), spectral-domain-optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), enhanced-depth imaging-OCT (EDI-OCT), OCT-angiography as well as fluorescein angiography, and indocyanine green angiography (ICGA). Two oncologic patients and one healthy patient presented unilateral whitish cornflake-shaped lesions on SLO multicolor and IRAF PPI, faintly or not visible on fundus photography, hypofluorescent on the intermediate-phase ICGA, but isofluorescent on the late-phase ICGA corresponding to hyperreflective areas in the choroid immediately under the retinal pigment epithelium on SD-OCT. The lesions were nonevolutive. Multimodal imaging determined that these \"nevoid\" lesions were melanocytic but could not be assimilated to classical nevi, having a looser structure that allowed some indocyanine green impregnation explaining the isofluorescence on the late-phase ICGA. The lesions were similar to those described in NF1 cases and were unrelated to the oncologic status."

Neurofibromas are the second-most common benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors arising from Schwann cells and are associated with neurofibromatosis. Chronic pain and opioid use is elevated in patients with NF1 when neurofibromas are associated with sensory nerves. Surgical excision is the primary treatment of neurofibromas when they become large, malignant, or painful, but they are associated with high rates of recurrence. Targeted muscle reinnervation and regenerative peripheral nerve interfaces are two prophylactic surgical techniques that are used to prevent neuroma-associated residual limb and phantom pain in amputees. Both techniques stimulate physiologic regeneration of the nerve via trophic stimulus from denervated muscle. This case report describes two patients with NF1 who underwent targeted muscle reinnervation and/or regenerative peripheral nerve interfaces at the time of amputation. Despite the abnormality of the peripheral nerves involved, both patients had excellent postoperative outcomes with minimal pain. This experience advocates for the use of prophylactic nerve management techniques in neurofibromatosis patients despite baseline nerve pathology."

Spinal neurofibromatosis (SNF) is a distinct clinical entity of NF1, characterized by bilateral neurofibromas involving all spinal nerve roots. Although both forms are caused by intragenic heterozygous variants of NF1, missense variants have been associated with SNF, according to a dominant inheritance model causing haploinsufficiency. Most patients carry pathogenic variants in one of the NF1 alleles; nevertheless, patients with both NF1-mutated copies have been described. Interestingly, all NF1 variants carried by the known SNF compound heterozygotes were missense/splicing variants or in-frame insertion-deletions. To investigate whether there is a differential expression of NF1 variant alleles in an NF1 compound heterozygous SNF patient possibly contributing to clinical phenotype. We performed an allele-specific expression study, by chip-based digital PCR, in an SNF family carrying two NF1 missense variants. We evaluated the expression levels of the two NF1-mutated alleles both carried by the compound heterozygous SNF patient and his relatives. Both alleles were expressed at comparable levels in the patient and hyper-expressed compared to the wild-type alleles of healthy controls. Here we provide new insights into expression studies of NF1-mutated transcripts suggesting that a novel pathogenetic mechanism, caused by gain-of-function variants, could be associated with SNF.

The malign schwannoma has been infrequently documented in the literature, and remarkably, no instances of such an extensive postoperative time without metastases have ever been described. A 46-year-old male patient with NF had multiple neurofibromas in different parts of his body, underwent surgery about 10 years ago (2013), and was diagnosed histopathologically as MPNST. He was admitted to our institution with a recurrent mass in the posterior third of the proximal thigh and severe pain radiating to the left lower extremity, which presented as sciatic pain (2021). A magnetic resonance imaging and fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography examination revealed that the tumor was likely malignant. Surgical excision was performed. A 10-year follow-up revealed no metastases or neurologic impairment. When articles about benign schwannomas are placed in a separate category, little is written about NF-1-related malignant schwannomas of the sciatic nerve. MPNSTs are high-grade, aggressive sarcomas with a high risk of local recurrence (40%-65%) and metastasis to other body parts. Therefore, among the various benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors in NF-1 patients, the diagnosis of MPNST is crucial.Orthopedic surgeons should be aware that neurofibromas in NF-1 have a significant risk of developing MPNSTs.

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type-1 is a genetic disorder caused by loss-of-function variants in the tumor-suppressor NF1. Approximately 4% to 11% of neurofibromatosis type-1 patients have a NF1 locus complete deletion resulting from nonallelic homologous recombination between low copy repeats. Codeleted genes probably account for the more severe phenotype observed in NF1-deleted patients. This genotype-phenotype correlation highlights the need for a detailed molecular description. A droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) set along the NF1 locus was designed to delimitate the three recurrent NF1 deletion breakpoints. The ddPCR was tested in 121 samples from nonrelated NF1-deleted patients. Classification based on ddPCR versus multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) was compared. In addition, microsatellites were analyzed to identify parental origin of deletions. ddPCR identified 77 type-1 (64%), 20 type-2 (16%), 7 type-3 (6%), and 17 atypical deletions (14%). The results were comparable with MLPA, except for three atypical deletions misclassified as type-2 using MLPA, for which the SUZ12 gene was not deleted. A significant maternal bias (25 of 30) in the origin of deletions was identified. This study proposes a fast and efficient ddPCR quantification to allow fine NF1 deletion classification. It indicates that ddPCR can be implemented easily into routine diagnosis to complement the techniques dedicated to NF1 point variant identification. This new tool may help unravel the genetic basis conditioning phenotypic variability in NF1-deleted patients and offer tailored genetic counseling."

    "title": "Impact of neurofibromatosis type 1 with plexiform neurofibromas on the health-related quality of life and work productivity of adult patients and caregivers in the UK: a cross-sectional survey.",
    "abstract": "Plexiform neurofibromas (PN) are complex, benign nerve-sheath tumours that occur in 30-50% of patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), a rare, genetic disorder. PN are associated with substantial, heterogeneous morbidities that impact health-related quality of life (HRQoL), including affecting motor function and causing pain, though HRQoL and work productivity data are scarce. This UK cross-sectional study explored HRQoL and work productivity in adult patients with NF1 PN and caregivers of paediatric patients. Adult patients and caregivers of paediatric patients self-enrolled in an online survey (March-April 2021). Outcomes included EQ-5D-5L, PROMIS® GH and INF1-QOL (adult patients only), and EQ-5D-5L, CarerQol and WPAI (caregivers only). Utilities were estimated from EQ-5D-5L responses using the UK crosswalk value set. Linear regression models explored univariable associations between adult patient characteristics and HRQoL. Mean (± standard deviation) EQ-5D utility in adult patients with NF1 PN was 0.65 (± 0.29; n = 35; age-/sex-matched norm: 0.89 [± 0.04]). Moderate-extreme pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression were reported by 14/35 (40.0%) and 18/35 (51.4%) patients, respectively. Mean PROMIS® GH physical and mental health scores were 43.6 (± 9.19) and 41.7 (± 11.5; n = 35; matched norm: 50.0 [± 10.0]). Mean INF1-QOL score was 11.03 (± 6.02; n = 33). Chronic itching, at least one symptom, at least one comorbidity, PN location at extremities (arms/legs) and pain were associated with worse HRQoL scores. Mean caregiver EQ-5D utility was 0.72 (± 0.24; n = 8; age-/sex-matched norm: 0.88 [± 0.03]). Moderate pain/discomfort and moderate-severe anxiety/depression were reported by 4/8 (50.0%) and 2/8 (25.0%) caregivers, respectively. Mean CarerQol score was 69.3 (± 13.9; n = 8). Mean WPAI regular activity productivity loss was 36.3% (± 31.6%; n = 8). NF1 PN worsens adult patient and caregiver HRQoL compared to the general population, notably affecting pain and discomfort, anxiety and depression and caregiver productivity."

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a hereditary, progressive and unpredictable disease, which can involve many organs. Benign and malignant tumors arise due to unrestrained cell division and cell growth. Recognizing the symptoms of these tumors and using the correct diagnostics is of great importance. In this clinical lesson we show the disease course of 3 patients with NF1. In all 3, the disease course was complicated by a symptomatic tumor. Characteristic in these patients is the relatively long interval between the onset of symptoms and the final tumor diagnosis. In this clinical lesson we examine the causes of this in more detail and we emphasize the importance of the specific knowledge within the Dutch national NF1 care network."

    "abstract": "To explore the types of NF1 gene variants and clinical characteristics among patients with Neurofibromatosis type I (NF1). Clinical data of 12 patients diagnosed at Ningbo Women and Children's Hospital between December 2019 and May 2022 were retrospectively analyzed. The probands and their family members were subjected to high-throughput sequencing, and candidate variants were verified by Sanger sequencing and chromosome microarray analysis. The 12 patients had ranged from 4 months to 27 years old, with a male-to-female ratio of 2 : 1. Cafè-au-lait spots were found in all patients. 83.3% of them also had axillary and/or inguinal freckling, 58.3% had neurofibromas, and 16.7% had congenital pseudarthrosis of the tibia. Five types of NF1 gene variants were identified in the patients, including 5 nonsense variants, 4 frameshift variants, 1 missense variant, 1 splice variant, 1 large deletion involving the whole gene. Six patients were found to harbor de novo variants, 2 had inherited the variants from their parents, and 4 were not verified for their parental origin. The c.3379del (p.Thr1127Glnfs*15) and c.6628_6629del (p.Glu2210Thrfs*10) variants were unreported in literature and databases. Most NF1 patients may present with Cafè-au-lait spots initially and are due to pathogenic variant of the NF1 gene. High-throughput sequencing can efficiently identify such variants among the patients and enable the definite diagnosis."

We present our surgical technique and mid-term outcomes of uninstrumented anterior tibial strut grafting for severe CK secondary to NF-1. Case report. The Consensus-based Clinical Case Reporting Guideline Development (CARE) guidelines were followed. Two paediatric patients (8- and 3-year-old) presented with severe CK secondary to NF-1. A halo body jacket (HV) allowed the progressive distraction of the cervical spine, avoiding neurological compromise and deformity progression. Circumferential fusion was obtained with anterior tibial strut autograft and posterior onlay bone graft. Cervical spine fusion was successfully maintained at a minimum 4-year follow-up in both patients. In children with severe CK secondary to NF-1, cervical distraction and immobilisation with a HV followed by uninstrumented anterior tibial strut grafting and posterior bone grafting, provided spinal fusion and stability without increasing the risk of neurological injury and donor site morbidity. The reported surgical technique appears to be a valuable tool in the armamentarium of the spinal surgeon."

    "abstract": "Autosomal dominantly inherited neurofibromatosis type I (NF1) is a systemic disorder caused by a mutation of a gene on chromosome 17q11.2 and characterized by multiple café-au-lait spots, lentiginous macules, Lisch nodules of the iris, and tumors of the nervous system. Bony manifestations such as scoliosis, dysplasia of the greater sphenoidal wing, tibial pseudoarthrosis, short stature, and macrocephaly have been reported in approximately 50% of patients. However, calvarial bone defects are rare. After screening 324 articles, 23 cases (12 adult and 11 pediatric patients) of occipital bone defects in NF1 patients were selected. All patients had a single/multiple bone defect over the lambdoid suture. Adjacent benign plexiform neurofibromas were observed in 14 patients (60.8%, 7 adults and 7 children); one adult patient was diagnosed with neurofibrosarcoma. Meningoencephalocele over the occipital defect was noted in 8 cases (34.78%, all adults). Cranioplasty was performed in only 17.39% of patients. Histologic examination was performed in 7 of the 15 patients with associated neurofibromas/neurofibrosarcomas. Biopsy of the bone margins surrounding the defect was performed in only one case. Pathologic examination of the herniated parieto-occipital or cerebellar tissue was not performed in any of the patients studied. We report the case of a 9-year-old girl with NF1 and a significant occipital bone defect and performed a systematic review of the relevant literature to highlight the challenges in treating this condition and to investigate the underlying mechanisms contributing to bone defects or dysplasia in NF1."

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant condition caused by germline mutations in the neurofibromin 1 (NF1) gene. Children with NF1 are prone to the development of multiple nervous system abnormalities, including autism and brain tumors, which could reflect the effect of NF1 mutation on microglia function. Using heterozygous Nf1-mutant mice, we previously demonstrated that impaired purinergic signaling underlies deficits in microglia process extension and phagocytosis in situ. To determine whether these abnormalities are also observed in human microglia in the setting of NF1, we leveraged an engineered isogenic series of human induced pluripotent stem cells to generate human microglia-like (hiMGL) cells heterozygous for three different NF1 gene mutations found in patients with NF1. Whereas all NF1-mutant and isogenic control hiMGL cells expressed classical microglia markers and exhibited similar transcriptomes and cytokine/chemokine release profiles, only NF1-mutant hiMGL cells had defects in P2X receptor activation, phagocytosis and motility. Taken together, these findings indicate that heterozygous NF1 mutations impair a subset of the functional properties of human microglia, which could contribute to the neurological abnormalities seen in children with NF1."

Patients with NF1 are prone to develop neoplasms of the central nervous system (CNS) and are particularly at risk for optic pathway gliomas (OPG). Epilepsy is another recognized neurologic complication in patients with NF1, with a prevalence estimated between 4% and 14%. Several case reports and early phase clinical trials have demonstrated that the mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitors (MEKi) are effective in NF1-low-grade gliomas (LGGs), but their influence on seizure activity in humans has not been established. Here, we report a patient with NF1 and developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE) harboring pharmacoresistant tonic seizures, and progressive optic pathway glioma (OPG). By using a MEKi therapy for her OPG, we observed an end to epileptic seizures as well as a significant improvement of interictal EEG abnormalities, despite a lack of tumor reduction. MEK inhibitor therapy should be considered for patients with NF1 and refractory epilepsy."

As neurocutaneous disorders are uncommon, obstetricians may be unfamiliar with these disorders and with recommendations for appropriate care of this population. This review aims to summarize existing literature on the interaction between neurocutaneous disorders and pregnancy and to provide a guide for physicians caring for an affected patient. A PubMed, MEDLINE, and Google Scholar search was carried out with a broad range of combinations of the medical subject headings (MeSH) terms \"pregnancy,\" \"Sturge -Weber,\" \"Neurofibromatosis Type 1,\" \"neurofibromatosis type 2,\" \"von Hippel Lindau,\" \"Tuberous Sclerosis,\" \"neurocutaneous disorder,\" \"treatment,\" \"congenital malformations,\" \"neurodevelopmental defects,\" \"miscarriage,\" \"breastfeeding,\" \"autoimmune,\" \"pathophysiology,\" and \"management.\" References of included articles were searched to identify any articles that may have been missed after the above method was used. Neurocutaneous disorders are associated with increased pregnancy-associated maternal and fetal/neonatal morbidity, largely surrounding hypertensive disorders, epilepsy, and medication exposure. Some features of neurocutaneous disorders may be worsened or accelerated by pregnancy. Neurocutaneous disorders can often be diagnosed prenatally. Therefore, directed assessment should be offered to affected individuals with a personal or family history of a neurocutaneous disorder. Patients affected by neurocutaneous disorders who are pregnant or planning for future pregnancy should be carefully followed by a multidisciplinary team, which could include maternal-fetal medicine, neurology, and anesthesia, as well as other relevant subspecialists.

However, proper early diagnosis is still crucial due to its various presentation such as cheek mass, painless swelling on skin, chalazion, intratracheal tumor, genital swelling or ptosis. It is reported that neurofibroma often represents as ocular or facial swelling. Here we are presenting features of neurofibroma of eight cases of patients from Civil Hospital, Karachi. These cases had main complain of overhanging skin mass mainly on orbital or periorbital region that damage the area and with poor daily activities. Multiple nodules on face and body along with them Cafe'-au-lait spots and lisch nodules were main signs. While, other signs i.e. ptosis, pterygium, telecanthus and muddy discoloration of conjunctiva need further evaluation for correlation with neurofibromatosis. Debulking surgery was planned for most of the cases but the huge disfigurement caused by overhanging skin mass and nodules made it a challenge for plastic surgeons to provide good outcomes with minimum damage.

An anonymous online survey of adults with neurofibromatosis assessed their physical, social, and emotional well-being and preferences about psychosocial interventions to inform clinical trial design. Neurofibromatosis clinical researchers and patient representatives from the Response Evaluation in Neurofibromatosis and Schwannomatosis International Collaboration developed the survey. Eligibility criteria included age ≥ 18 years, self-reported diagnosis of NF1, NF2, or SWN, and ability to read and understand English. The online survey was distributed internationally by the Neurofibromatosis Registry and other neurofibromatosis foundations from June to August 2020. Surveys were completed by 630 adults (18-81 years of age; M = 45.5) with NF1 (78%), NF2 (14%), and SWN (8%) who were mostly White, not Hispanic/Latino, female, and from the United States. The majority (91%) reported that their neurofibromatosis symptoms had at least some impact on daily life. In the total sample, 51% endorsed a mental health diagnosis, and 27% without a diagnosis believed they had an undiagnosed mental health condition. Participants indicated that neurofibromatosis affected their emotional (44%), physical (38%), and social (35%) functioning to a high degree. Few reported ever having participated in a drug (6%) or psychosocial (7%) clinical trial, yet 68% reported they \"probably\" or \"definitely\" would want to participate in a psychosocial trial if it targeted a relevant concern. Top treatment targets were anxiety, healthier lifestyle, and daily stress. Top barriers to participating in psychosocial trials were distance to clinic, costs, and time commitment. Respondents preferred interventions delivered by clinicians via individual sessions or a combination of group and individual sessions, with limited in-person and mostly remote participation. There were no significant group differences by neurofibromatosis type in willingness to participate in psychosocial trials (<i>p</i> = 0.27). Regarding interest in intervention targets, adults with SWN were more likely to prefer psychosocial trials for pain support compared to those with NF1 (<i>p</i> < 0.001) and NF2 (<i>p</i> < 0.001). This study conducted the largest survey assessing physical symptoms, mental health needs, and preferences for psychosocial trials in adults with neurofibromatosis. Results indicate a high prevalence of disease manifestations, psychosocial difficulties, and untreated mental health problems in adults with neurofibromatosis and a high degree of willingness to participate in psychosocial clinical trials. Patient preferences should be considered when designing and implementing psychosocial interventions to develop the most feasible and meaningful studies."

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a rare disease, affecting around 1 in 3500 individuals in the general population. The rarity of the disease contributes to the scarcity of the available diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. Multispectral imaging is a non-invasive imaging method that shows promise in the diagnosis of various skin diseases. The device utilized for the present study consisted of four sets of narrow-band LEDs, including 526 nm, 663 nm, and 964 nm for diffuse reflectance imaging and 405 nm LEDs, filtered through a 515 nm long-pass filter, for autofluorescence imaging. RGB images were captured using a CMOS camera inside of the device. This paper presents the results of this multispectral skin imaging approach to distinguish the lesions in patients with NF1 from other more common benign skin lesions. The results show that the method provides a potential novel approach to distinguish NF1 lesions from other benign skin lesions."

A total of 61 cNFs from 10 patients with NF1 were immunolabeled for different types of T cells and macrophages, and the cell densities were correlated with clinical characteristics. Eight cNFs and their overlying skin were analyzed for T cell receptor CDR domain sequences, and mass spectrometry of 15 cNFs and the overlying skin was performed to study immune-related processes. Intratumoral T cells were detected in all cNFs. Tumors from individuals younger than the median age of the study participants (33 years), growing tumors, and tumors smaller than the data set median showed increased T cell density. Most samples displayed intratumoral or peritumoral aggregations of CD3-positive cells. T cell receptor sequencing demonstrated that the skin and cNFs host distinct T cell populations, whereas no dominant cNF-specific T cell clones were detected. Unique T cell clones were fewer in cNFs than in skin, and mass spectrometry suggested lower expression of proteins related to T cell-mediated immunity in cNFs than in skin. CD163-positive cells, suggestive of M2 macrophages, were abundant in cNFs. Human cNFs have substantial T cell and macrophage populations that may be tumor-specific."

    "abstract": "Juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia (JMML) is characterized by gene variants that deregulate the RAS signalling pathway. Children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1) carry a defective NF1 allele in the germline and are predisposed to JMML, which presumably requires somatic inactivation of the NF1 wild-type allele. Here we examined the two-hit concept in leukaemic cells of 25 patients with JMML and NF-1. Ten patients with JMML/NF-1 exhibited a NF1 loss-of-function variant in combination with uniparental disomy of the 17q arm. Five had NF1 microdeletions combined with a pathogenic NF1 variant and nine carried two compound-heterozygous NF1 variants. We also examined 16 patients without clinical signs of NF-1 and no variation in the JMML-associated driver genes PTPN11, KRAS, NRAS or CBL (JMML-5neg) and identified eight patients with NF1 variants. Three patients had microdeletions combined with hemizygous NF1 variants, three had compound-heterozygous NF1 variants and two had heterozygous NF1 variants. In addition, we found a high incidence of secondary ASXL1 and/or SETBP1 variants in both groups. We conclude that the clinical diagnosis of JMML/NF-1 reliably indicates a NF1-driven JMML subtype, and that careful NF1 analysis should be included in the genetic workup of JMML even in the absence of clinical evidence of NF-1."

    "abstract": "Thalamic hypometabolism is a consistent finding in brain PET with F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). However, the pathophysiology of this metabolic alteration is unknown. We hypothesized that it might be secondary to disturbance of peripheral input to the thalamus by NF1-characteristic peripheral nerve sheath tumors (PNSTs). To test this hypothesis, we investigated the relationship between thalamic FDG uptake and the number, volume, and localization of PNSTs. This retrospective study included 22 adult NF1 patients (41% women, 36.2 ± 13.0 years) referred to whole-body FDG-PET/contrast-enhanced CT for suspected malignant transformation of PNSTs and 22 sex- and age-matched controls. Brain FDG uptake was scaled voxelwise to the individual median uptake in cerebellar gray matter. Bilateral mean and left-right asymmetry of thalamic FDG uptake were determined using a left-right symmetric anatomical thalamus mask. PNSTs were manually segmented in contrast-enhanced CT. Thalamic FDG uptake was reduced in NF1 patients by 2.0 standard deviations (p < .0005) compared to controls. Left-right asymmetry was increased by 1.3 standard deviations (p = .013). Thalamic hypometabolism was higher in NF1 patients with ≥3 PNSTs than in patients with ≤2 PNSTs (2.6 vs. 1.6 standard deviations, p = .032). The impact of the occurrence of paraspinal/paravertebral PNSTs and of the mean PNST volume on thalamic FDG uptake did not reach statistical significance (p = .098 and p = .189). Left-right asymmetry of thalamic FDG uptake was not associated with left-right asymmetry of PNST burden (p = .658). This study provides first evidence of left-right asymmetry of thalamic hypometabolism in NF1 and that it might be mediated by NF1-associated peripheral tumors."

To better study the tumor heterogeneity of MPNST and to develop diverse treatment options, more tumor-derived cell lines are needed to obtain richer biological information. Here, we established a primary cell line of relapsed MPNST RsNF cells derived from a patient diagnosed with NF1 and detected the presence of NF1 mutations and SUZ12 somatic mutations through whole-exome sequencing(WES). Through tumor molecular marker targeted sequencing and single-cell transcriptome sequencing, it was found that chromosome 7 copy number variation (CNV) was gained in this cell line, and ZNF804B, EGFR, etc., were overexpressed on chromosome 7. Therefore, RsNF cells can be used as a useful tool in NF1-associated MPNST genomic amplification studies and to develop new therapeutic strategies."

However, despite intense interest over decades, multiple preclinical and clinical issues need to be resolved before they become a reality. The optimal approaches to gene-, mRNA-, or protein restoration and to delivery to the appropriate cell types remain elusive. Preclinical models that recapitulate manifestations of neurofibromatosis 1 and schwannomatosis need to be refined. The development of validated assays for measuring neurofibromin and merlin activity in animal and human tissues will be critical for early-stage trials, as will the selection of appropriate patients, based on their individual genotypes and risk/benefit balance. Once the safety of gene-targeted therapy for symptomatic tumors has been established, the possibility of addressing a wide range of symptoms, including non-tumor manifestations, should be explored. As preclinical efforts are underway, it will be essential to educate both clinicians and those affected by neurofibromatosis 1/schwannomatosis about the risks and benefits of gene-targeted therapy for these conditions."

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a neurogenetic disorder associated with visual-spatial problems, executive dysfunction, and language deficits, making patients experience social isolation, stigma, anxiety, and depression. Here, we explored NF1 patients' lived experiences by conducting semi-structured, in-depth interviews with 21 NF1 patients and 16 care providers. The thematic analysis uncovered dimensions of NF1 patients' social lives at different ecological levels, including their relationships with family, friends, teachers, coworkers, providers, and society. Positive dimensions of NF1 patients' social life (e.g. familial support and sacrifice, responsibility, and self-sufficiency, supportive friends, and professors) counter negative dimensions (e.g. the vulnerability in sexual relationships, social interactions, discriminatory professors, misconceptions about abilities, appearance bias, internalized and social stigma, violence, and low self-esteem). Adaptive strategies used or suggested by NF1 patients at personal (e.g. supportive network, positive reframing, acceptance of their bodies) and social levels (e.g. psychological support, group therapy, public awareness, and governmental support) were identified."

We included 14 patients with NF1, according to international consensus recommendations, and 16 healthy individuals formed the control group. This was retrospectively observational study followed STROBE guideline. Both groups underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging including DTI and 3-dimensional T1-weighted imaging. We analyzed structural connectivity using DTI and Diffusion Spectrum Imaging Studio software and evaluated the structural covariance network based on the structural volumes using FreeSurfer and Brain Analysis Using Graph Theory software. There were no differences in the global structural connectivity between the 2 groups, but several brain regions showed significant differences in local structural connectivity. Additionally, there were differences between the global structural covariance networks. The characteristic path length was longer and the small-worldness index was lower in patients with NF1. Furthermore, several regions showed significant differences in the local structural covariance networks. We observed changes in structural connectivity and covariance networks in patients with NF1 compared to a healthy control group. We found that global structural efficiency is decreased in the brains of patients with NF1, and widespread changes in the local structural network were found. These results suggest that NF1 is a brain network disease, and our study provides direction for further research to elucidate the biological processes of NF1."

    "abstract": "Little is known about employment status, occupation, and disposable income in adults with NF1. From the Danish National Patient Registry and database of two national Centers for Rare Diseases, we identified 1469 adults with NF1, who were matched to 11,991 randomly selected population comparisons on sex and birth year and month. Annual information on employment, occupation and disposable income was ascertained from national registries in 1980-2019. Adults with NF1 had a lower odds ratio (OR) for employment [OR 0.71, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.61-0.83] and higher OR for health-related unemployment (OR 2.94, 95% CI 2.16-3.96) at age 30 years than population comparisons, which persisted at age 40 and 50 years. Somatic diagnoses were associated with a higher OR for health-related unemployment in adults with NF1 than in the population comparisons. Adults with NF1 had a slightly lower disposable income, with a 14% (0.82-0.89) reduction observed among the youngest birth cohort. Furthermore, adults with NF1 were less likely to be in a high skilled occupation at ages 30, 40 and 50 years. Adults with NF1 have a lower employment rate, which was mainly due to health-related reasons and a slightly lower disposable income than adults without NF1. Thus, anticipation guidance for employment should be part of the management of NF1 families."

It is characterized by café-au-lait macules without the tumoral manifestations of NF1. We report the case of an 11-year-old patient with multiple café-au-lait macules and intertriginous freckling who was admitted for bloody stools, joint pain, and weight loss. His clinical and endoscopic findings were consistent with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). He also met the clinical diagnostic criteria for NF1 but not for LS. Genetic testing played a pivotal role in the differential diagnosis and revealed a loss-of-function mutation in the <i>SPRED1</i> gene, confirming the diagnosis of LS. This is the first reported case of a patient with IBD and LS. The subtle manifestations of LS make it an underdiagnosed disease, which reduces the likelihood of it being diagnosed in association with other diseases, such as IBD. There are, however, 10 published case reports linking IBD and NF1, and some pathophysiological mechanisms have been proposed. Continued reporting will help clarify the relationship between IBD and RASopathies such as NF1 and LS."

We aim to report the clinical and radiological presentations in a Tunisian pediatric cohort. We identified moyamoya angiopathy in pediatric patients managed at the Child Neurology Department of Hedi Chaker Sfax University Hospital between 2008 and 2020 and reviewed their clinical and radiological data as well as their evolutionary profile. We collected 14 patients with median age 40.6 months and a female predominance (sex ratio of 0.75). An arterial ischemic stroke (AIS) revealed the disease in all patients, with the major symptom being a motor deficit. Symptoms related to a transient ischemic attack before the diagnostic consultation were reported in four patients. Carotid territory was, clinically and radiologically, the most frequently involved. Brain magnetic resonance imaging with angiography was performed in 12 patients confirming the diagnosis by revealing the development of collateral vessels. All the investigations concluded to moyamoya disease in 57.2% and moyamoya syndrome in 42.8%. The latter was related to Down syndrome in five patients and neurofibromatosis type 1 in one patient. With a mean follow-up of 2.35 years, two patients had at least two more AISs during the first two years following diagnosis and 42.8% of patients were diagnosed with vascular or poststroke epilepsy. Full recovery was noted in 14.3% of cases. Moyamoya angiopathy in children is a serious condition that needs to be recognized due to the high risk of recurrent ischemic strokes."

Many are unaware of the extent of pulmonary involvement, including lung cysts and emphysematous bullae, which enhances the risk of secondary spontaneous pneumothorax (SSP). We report the case of an 18-year-old male with NF1 who presented with acute dyspnoea and chest pain due to a right-sided pneumothorax caused by the rupture of lung apical bullae. The patient received supplemental oxygen and a chest tube of 18F was inserted, with a complete resolution of the pneumothorax. He was discharged on the third day of hospital stay. This case highlights the importance of considering SSP as a possible clinical manifestation and complication of NF1. Early recognition and appropriate management of this condition can prevent serious complications and improve patient outcomes. NF1 is a genetic disease that results in cutaneous conditions, including neurofibroma, axillary, inguinal lentigines and <i>café au lait</i> spots. In some cases (5-20%) it can also affect the lungs, causing neurofibroma, infiltrative and cystic lesions, emphysema or bullae, leading to chronic respiratory failure.SSP is a clinical presentation of NF1 caused by the rupture of lung cysts or bullae, with an unclear relationship to smoking.Early diagnosis of pulmonary manifestations in patients with NF1 is crucial as surgical removal of lung cysts and bullae seems to prevent recurrence of SSP."

SEGA typically arises during the first two decades of life and rarely arises after the age of 20-25 years. Nevertheless, it has also been reported that glioma histologically resembling SEGA, so-called SEGA-like astrocytoma, can arise in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) patients, even in the elderly. Herein, we report a case of SEGA-like circumscribed astrocytoma arising in the lateral ventricle of a 75-year-old woman. Whole-exome sequencing revealed a somatic variant of NF1. Methylation array analysis led to a diagnosis of \"methylation class glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype, mesenchymal-type (GBM, MES)\" with a high calibrated score (0.99). EGFR amplification, CDKN2A/B homozygous deletion, chromosomal +7/-10 alterations, and TERT promoter mutation, typical molecular abnormalities usually found in GBM, were also observed. While most reported cases of SEGA-like astrocytoma have arisen in NF1 patients, the patient was neither TSC nor NF1. Near total removal was accomplished with endoscopic cylinder surgery. At the 36-month follow-up, there was no tumor recurrence without adjuvant therapies. This clinical behavior did not match GBM. SEGA-like astrocytoma of the elderly is rare, and this is the oldest case reported so far. In addition, high-grade molecular features found in circumscribed tumor remain unclear. Further investigations among larger series are needed for clarifying the underlying molecular mechanisms."

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a genetic disorder characterised by multiple neurofibromas, café-au-lait spots, and iris hamartomas. The variety of vasculopathies that can occur in NF1 make it difficult for clinicians to accurately follow-up patients. Most cases of vasculopathies are stenotic, and, in few cases, aneurysms may form. A 35-year-old male presented with extreme left flank pain for the past 2 days. His physical examination revealed whole-body several café-au-lait skin macules, a subcutaneous lesion, and a palpable abdominal mass in the left flank. His laboratory workup was within normal ranges. A multi-slice computed tomography and computed tomography angiogram with contrast outlined a giant left renal artery aneurysm (RAA). A kidney salvage surgery was planned. However, due to ectatic dilatation and large extension of the aneurysm, the affected renal artery branches and renal vein were found unfit for auto-transplantation during the surgical procedure and a total nephrectomy was necessary. Symptoms improved significantly postoperatively and no complications developed. RAA is an uncommon finding in NF1 patients. Diagnosis is often dependent on computed tomography angiogram. Management techniques are conservative, endovascular, or surgical. In few surgical cases, a total nephrectomy may be necessary if auto-transplantation is not feasible. Despite its rarity, the diagnosis of RAA should be considered in patients with NF1 presenting with flank pain. Moreover, early screening for renal vasculopathies can evade critical surgical outcomes including a total nephrectomy. Hence, the authors recommend a total vascular workup for these patients, consisting of doppler ultrasound and, if necessary, a multi-slice computed tomography with contrast."

    "abstract": "Multiple gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) combined with cutaneous multiple neurofibromas are clinically rare. This paper presents a case of multiple gastrointestinal stromal tumors in the jejunum of a 68-year-old mother, along with her daughter who also had coexisting cutaneous multiple neurofibromas. The mother had been experiencing repeated melena for over 2 years and had previously been diagnosed with multiple small intestinal masses at other hospitals. Additionally, her 42-year-old daughter was admitted to our department due to recurrent abdominal pain caused by cholecystolithiasis. The mother and daughter both exhibited multiple nodular masses of varying sizes on their skin, including the truncus, limbs, and face, which were diagnosed as neurofibromas. The mother underwent a partial excision of the jejunum and a lateral jejunojejunal anastomosis side-to-side, as well as excision of skin lesions in our department. The final diagnosis of wild-type GISTs associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) was confirmed through postoperative pathology, immunohistochemistry, and genetic testing results. During preoperative gastrointestinal endoscopy and intraoperative laparoscopic exploration of the gastrointestinal tract, no obvious tumors were found in her daughter. A combination of patient observations and a review of relevant literature in the field suggests that when patients present with gastrointestinal symptoms and multiple irregular painless swellings in the skin, it is important to consider the possibility of an association with NF1 and GIST. Additionally, obtaining a detailed family history can save time and improve the diagnosis of patients with both NF1 and GIST. We recommend that even if there are no gastrointestinal manifestations of GISTs in the offspring of newly mutated NF1 patients, regular review of gastroenteroscopy, imaging examination, and long-term follow-up after middle age are still crucial for the early diagnosis and treatment of NF1-related GISTs."

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Many advancements have been made in understanding the biologic underpinnings of these conditions, and in 2016 the first drug was approved by the FDA to treat pediatric symptomatic unresectable plexiform neurofibromas. RECENT FINDINGS: Mek inhibitors have provided a much-needed therapeutic avenue for NF1 patients with unresectable plexiform neurofibromas (PN), both for reduction of tumor bulk and for improvement in symptoms. Selumetinib is the first FDA approved drug for PN, but is only approved for children. Some research suggests that alternative Mek inhibitors and other mixed tyrosine kinase inhibitors may have better efficacy in adults. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor bevacizumab can prolong hearing and delay the need for surgery in NF2 patients with bilateral vestibular schwannomas. This article provides an update regarding considerations and approaches when treating the tumors associated with the neurofibromatoses (NF), including risk and prognosis metrics, clinical trial results, surgical techniques, and radiation therapy recommendations."

The implementation of a common data model would further enhance biomarker discovery by enabling effective concatenation of data from multiple studies. The Response Evaluation in Neurofibromatosis and Schwannomatosis biomarker working group reviewed published data on emerging trends in neurofibromatosis 1 and schwannomatosis biomarker research and developed recommendations in a series of consensus meetings. Liquid biopsy has emerged as a promising assay for neurofibromatosis 1/schwannomatosis biomarker discovery and validation. In addition, we review recommendations for a range of biomarkers in clinical trials, neurofibromatosis 1/schwannomatosis-specific data annotations, and common data models for data integration. These Response Evaluation in Neurofibromatosis and Schwannomatosis consensus guidelines are intended to provide best practices for the inclusion of biomarker studies in neurofibromatosis 1/schwannomatosis clinical trials, data, and sample annotation and to lay a framework for data harmonization and concatenation between trials."

    "abstract": "The aim of this study is to evaluate neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) patients with whole-body MRI (WBMRI) to investigate the frequency of plexiform neurofibromas (pNFs), diffuse neurofibromas (dNFs), and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs). In this retrospective cross-sectional study, between the years 2015 and 2023, 83 consecutive patients with known NF1 underwent a total of 110 WBMRI screenings for MPNST using a standardized institutional protocol. The lesions are categorized as discrete lesions, pNFs, dNFs, and MPNSTs. Histopathology served as the reference standard for all MPNSTs. Among the 83 patients analyzed, 53 (64%) were women and 30 were men (36%) of ages 36.94±14.43 years (range, 15-66 years). Of the 83 patients, 33 have a positive family history of NF1 and positive genetic studies. Seven of 83 (8%) have only dNF, 20/83 (24%) have pNF, 28/83 (34%) have both dNF and pNF, and 28/83 (34%) have neither. Of the 83 patients, eight (9.6%) were diagnosed with nine total MPNSTs. Age range for patients with MPNSTs at time of diagnosis was 22-51, with an average age of 33.4 years. Only one MPNST (11%) developed from underlying pNF 4 years after WBMRI along the right bronchial tree. Three of eight (37.5%) patients with MPNST died within 5 years of pathologic diagnosis. This study suggests the absence of a predisposition for development of MPNST from pNFs and dNFs in the setting of NF1. As such, these lesions may not need special surveillance compared to discrete peripheral nerve sheath tumors."

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 is a genetic disorder impacting approximately 2.5 million people worldwide, often leading to development of numerous benign yet disfiguring cutaneous neurofibromas (cNF). Removal of cNF is limited to excision or laser ablation with common post-operation complications and scarring. The current case explores a new approach to removal or reduction of cNF by a minimally invasive and pain-reduced treatment modality. A 40-year-old female patient with numerous cNF across her body underwent a single treatment using a 20 MHz dermatologically focused ultrasound device on seven selected cNF on the upper back. Each cNF was treated in a single session of 20-60 s without anesthesia due to manageable pain. Only one minimal adverse reaction in the form of dyspigmentation in a single treated tumor was noted from treatment or during the healing of a thin scab that formed on each cNF a few days after treatment. At the 12-month follow-up, four out of seven treated cNF showed full remission, two showed partial or significant reduction in tumor volume, while two did not respond to treatment. The reason for the variability is not fully understood, but speculations include difference in tissue content, e.g., due to tumor age. The method is concluded to be a promising candidate for a new safe and minimally invasive treatment that can potentially be used for single-session removal/reduction of a large number of cNF. Further research should focus on refining treatment parameters and strategies to enhance response predictability."

This article retrospectively analyzed and summarized the clinical data of this case series, with the aim of exploring the main technical details and clinical prognosis. Included were patients with OPG-uDCⅠ without neurofibromatosis type 1 and experiencing vision loss on the affected side. The fronto-orbital approach was used, which was mainly divided into 3 parts: intraorbital, optic canal, and intracranial. All patients underwent prechiasmatic resection without any adjuvant treatments. The follow-up period was 3 months after surgery, and magnetic resonance imaging and contralateral visual acuity were reviewed annually after surgery. All OPG-uDCⅠ cases were completely removed without any adjuvant treatments, and there was no recurrence during the follow-up period. Pathological results showed that, except for 1 adult patient with pilomyxoid astrocytoma (World Health Organization grade Ⅱ), the others all had pilocytic astrocytoma (World Health Organization grade Ⅰ). Five patients experienced transient ptosis, and all recovered 3 months after surgery. For OPG-uDCⅠ without neurofibromatosis type 1, radical prechiasmatic resection of the tumor is possible, without the need for postoperative radiotherapy and chemotherapy."

There are no prospective studies of cerebral vasculopathy in NF1; thus, the estimated frequency of vasculopathy varies between studies. The data is difficult to interpret due to the retrospective data collection and variability in whether imaging is done based on screening/surveillance or due to acute neurologic symptoms. The prevalent NF1-associated cerebral vasculopathy is moyamoya syndrome (MMS). Vascular changes can present without symptoms or with acute TIA or stroke-like symptoms or a range of progressive neurologic deficits. Advanced imaging may enhance sensitivity of neuroimaging in children. Medical and/or surgical interventions may prevent short- and long-term complications. Challenges for establishment of a screening protocol for cerebral vasculopathy in children with NF1 include the relatively large number of patients with NF1, the potential need for sedation to achieve quality imaging and the broad age range at time of detection for cerebral vascular changes. The goal of this review is to present the epidemiology, clinical presentation, imaging features and medical/surgical management of cerebral arteriopathies in children with NF1."

Therefore, we evaluated the genomic information of NMIBC and identified molecular alterations associated with tumour recurrence. A total of 43 patients with NMIBC who underwent transurethral resection of the bladder were enrolled. We performed NGS using an Oncomine panel of tumour specimens and blood samples corresponding to each specimen. The somatic mutation results were analysed by pairwise comparison and logistic regression according to the recurrence of bladder tumours within 1 year. The median incidence of genetic variations in 43 tumour samples was 56 variations per sample, and a high tumour mutation burden (TMB) was associated with tumour recurrence (median variation 33 vs. 64, <i>p</i> = 0.023). The most mutated gene was adipose tissue macrophages (<i>ATM</i>) (79%), followed by neurofibromatosis-1 (<i>NF1</i>) (79%), and neurogenic locus notch homolog protein 1 (<i>NOTCH1</i>) (79%). In multivariable analysis, mutation of epidermal growth factor receptor (<i>EGFR</i>) (odds ratio [OR], 9.95; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.40-70.96; <i>p</i> = 0.022) and telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) (OR, 7.92; 95% CI, 1.22-51.51; <i>p</i> = 0.030) were significant factors associated with the recurrence of bladder tumour within 1 year. Our results revealed that high TMB, EGFR mutation, and TERT mutation had a significant association with tumour recurrence in NMIBC. In addition, somatic mutations in EGFR and TERT could be useful prognostic biomarkers in NMIBC."

We retrospectively reviewed surgically managed primary craniospinal MPNSTs treated at our institution between January 2005 and May 2023. Patient demographics, tumor features, and treatment outcomes were assessed. Neurological function was quantified using the Frankel grade and Karnofsky performance scores. Descriptive statistics, rank-sum tests, and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were performed. Eight patients satisfied the inclusion criteria (4 male, 4 female). The median age at presentation was 38 years (range 15-67). Most tumors were localized to the spine (75%), and 3 patients had neurofibromatosis type 1. The most common presenting symptoms were paresthesia (50%) and visual changes (13%). The median tumor size was 3 cm, and most tumors were oval-shaped (50%) with well-defined borders (75%). Six tumors were high grade (75%), and gross total resection was achieved in 5 patients, with subtotal resection in the remaining 3 patients.

    "abstract": "Cutaneous neurofibromas (cNF) are considered one of the highest burdens of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). To date, no medical treatment can cure cNF or prevent their development. In that context, there is an urgent need to prepare and standardize the methodology of future trials targeting cNF. The objective was to develop a core outcome domain set suitable for all clinical trials targeting NF1-associated cNF. The validated approach of this work consisted of a three-phase methodology: (i) generating the domains [systematic literature review (SLR) and qualitative studies]; (ii) agreeing (three-round international e-Delphi consensus process and working groups); and (iii) voting. (i) The SLR and the qualitative studies (three types of focus groups and a French e-survey with 234 participants) resulted in a preliminary list of 31 candidate items and their corresponding definitions. (ii) A total of 229 individuals from 29 countries participated in the first round of the e-Delphi process: 71 patients, relatives or representatives (31.0%), 130 healthcare professionals (HCPs, 56.8%) and 28 researchers, representatives of a drug regulatory authority, industry or pharmaceutical company representatives or journal editors (12.2%). The overall participation rate was 74%. After round 2, five candidate items were excluded. Between rounds 2 and 3, international workshops were held to better understand the disagreements among stakeholders. This phase led to the identification of 19 items as outcome subdomains. (iii) The items were fused to create four outcome domains ('clinical assessment', 'daily life impact', 'patient satisfaction' and 'perception of health') and prioritized. The seven items that did not reach consensus were marked for the research agenda. The final core outcome domain set reached 100% of the votes of the steering committee members. Although numerous outcomes can be explored in studies related to cNF in NF1, the present study offers four outcome domains that should be reported in all trial studies, agreed on by international patients, relatives and representatives of patients; HCPs; researchers, representatives of drug regulatory authorities or pharmaceutical companies and journal editors. The next step will include the development of a set of core outcome measurement instruments to further standardize how these outcomes should be assessed."

    "title": "Development and pilot validation of a novel disfigurement severity scale for plexiform neurofibromas in children with neurofibromatosis type 1.",
    "abstract": "We developed an observer disfigurement severity scale for neurofibroma-related plexiform neurofibromas to assess change in plexiform neurofibroma-related disfigurement and evaluated its feasibility, reliability, and validity. Twenty-eight raters, divided into four cohorts based on neurofibromatosis type 1 familiarity and clinical experience, were shown photographs of children in a clinical trial (NCT01362803) at baseline and 1 year on selumetinib treatment for plexiform neurofibromas (<i>n</i> = 20) and of untreated participants with plexiform neurofibromas (<i>n</i> = 4). Raters, blinded to treatment and timepoint, completed the 0-10 disfigurement severity score for plexiform neurofibroma on each image (0 = not at all disfigured, 10 = very disfigured). Raters evaluated the ease of completing the scale, and a subset repeated the procedure to assess intra-rater reliability. Mean baseline disfigurement severity score for plexiform neurofibroma ratings were similar for the selumetinib group (6.23) and controls (6.38). Mean paired differences between pre- and on-treatment ratings was -1.01 (less disfigurement) in the selumetinib group and 0.09 in the control (<i>p</i> = 0.005). For the disfigurement severity score for plexiform neurofibroma ratings, there was moderate-to-substantial agreement within rater cohorts (weighted kappa range = 0.46-0.66) and agreement between scores of the same raters at repeat sessions (<i>p</i> > 0.05). In the selumetinib group, change in disfigurement severity score for plexiform neurofibroma ratings was moderately correlated with change in plexiform neurofibroma volume with treatment (<i>r</i> = 0.60). This study demonstrates that our observer-rated disfigurement severity score for plexiform neurofibroma was feasible, reliable, and documented improvement in disfigurement in participants with plexiform neurofibroma shrinkage. Prospective studies in larger samples are needed to validate this scale further."

    "abstract": "Given the considerable discrepancies in the evidence concerning the efficacy of statins in ameliorating cognitive impairments in pediatric patients with Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF-1), this study conducts a systematic review and meta-analysis to consolidate existing evidence to evaluate the efficacy of statins on cognitive impairments in children with NF-1. This study adhered to the PRISMA statement, and the research protocol was pre-registered on PROSPERO (#CRD: 42022369072). Comprehensive searches of databases including PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were performed up to March 31, 2023 to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the effects of statins on cognitive impairments in children with NF-1. Statistical analyses were conducted using Review Manager 5.4.1. A fixed- or random-effects model was employed according to the <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> statistic. As all data were continuous, MD [95% CI] was used as the pooled estimate. The final analysis included five RCTs with a total of 364 patients. The meta-analysis indicated that aside from a statistically significant improvement in internalizing problems (MD [95%CI] = 3.61[0.11, 7.10], <i>p</i> = 0.04), Object assembly Test (MD [95%CI] = 0.53[0.12, 0.93], <i>p</i> = 0.01), Cancellation Test (MD [95%CI] = 3.61[0.11, 7.10], <i>p</i> < 0.0001), statins did not exhibit significant efficacy in improving other cognitive aspects in children with NF-1 (<i>p </i>> 0.05). An additional descriptive analysis on indices that cannot be meta-analyzed revealed considerable inconsistency in the therapeutic effect of statins across different studies. Current evidence suggests that statins may not be effective for cognitive performance in children with NF-1."

    "abstract": "Inflammatory rhabdomyoblastic tumors (IRMTs) are newly recognized skeletal muscle tumors with uncertain malignant potential. We investigated 13 IRMTs using clinicopathologic, genetic, and epigenetic methods. The cohort included 7 men and 6 women, aged 23 to 80 years (median, 50 years), of whom 2 had neurofibromatosis type 1. Most tumors occurred in the deep soft tissues of the lower limbs, head/neck, trunk wall, and retroperitoneum/pelvis. Two tumors involved the hypopharyngeal submucosa as polypoid masses. Eight tumors showed conventional histology of predominantly spindled cells with nuclear atypia, low mitotic activity, and massive inflammatory infiltrates. Three tumors showed atypical histology, including uniform epithelioid or plump cells and mitotically active histiocytes. The remaining 2 tumors demonstrated malignant progression to rhabdomyosarcoma; one had additional IRMT histology and the other was a pure sarcoma. All 11 IRMTs without malignant progression exhibited indolent behavior at a median follow-up of 43 months. One of the 2 patients with IRMTs with malignant progression died of lung metastases. All IRMTs were positive for desmin and PAX7, whereas myogenin and MyoD1 were expressed in a subset of cases. Targeted next-generation sequencing identified pathogenic mutations in NF1 (5/8) and TP53 (4/8). All TP53 mutations co-occurred with NF1 mutations. TP53 variant allele frequency was much lower than that of NF1 in 2 cases. These tumors showed geographic (subclonal) strong p53 immunoreactivity, suggesting the secondary emergence of a TP53-mutant clone. DNA methylation-based copy number analysis conducted in 11 tumors revealed characteristic flat patterns with relative gains, including chromosomes 5, 18, 20, 21, and/or 22 in most cases. Widespread loss of heterozygosity with retained biparental copies of these chromosomes was confirmed in 4 tumors analyzed via allele-specific profiling. Based on unsupervised DNA methylation analysis, none of the 11 tumors tested clustered with existing reference entities but formed a coherent group, although its specificity warrants further study."

Various acute and chronic pathologic conditions, most importantly pontine infarctions and increased intracranial pressure, can result in acute sixth cranial nerve palsies. We report the uncommon occurrence of acute abducens nerve palsy following spinal fusion surgery in an 18-year-old male patient with a history of multiple neurological and orthopedic conditions. Postoperatively, the patient presented with symptoms that included left diplopia with restricted upward and downward gaze, indicative of abducens nerve palsy. The anatomy of the sixth cranial nerve is discussed, potential etiologies of sixth nerve palsy presented, and a proposed diagnostic workup reviewed.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common autosomal dominant disorder predisposing affected individuals to tumorigenesis, including benign plexiform neurofibromas; however, understanding of factors associated with tumor risk in NF1 patients is limited. Therefore, we investigated whether pregestational folic acid intake modified plexiform-like peripheral nerve sheath tumor risk in a transgenic NF1 murine model. We observed no significant differences in overall survival according to folate group. Relative to controls (180 days), median survival did not statistically differ in deficient (174 days, P = 0.56) or supplemented (177 days, P = 0.13) folate groups. Dietary folate intake was positively associated with RBC folate levels at weaning, (P = 0.023, 0.0096, and 0.0006 for deficient vs. control, control vs. supplemented, and deficient vs. supplemented groups, respectively). Dorsal root ganglia (DRG), brachial plexi, and sciatic nerves were assessed according to folate group. Mice in the folate deficient group had significantly more enlarged DRG relative to controls (P = 0.044), but no other groups statistically differed. No significant differences for brachial plexi or sciatic nerve enlargement were observed according to folate status."

A 27-year-old male patient was referred to our department with an extended right nasal cavity MPNST. The lesion extended to the skull base, intracranial, parapharyngeal space, and infratemporal fossa. NF-1 was also confirmed by a neurologist. The patient was negative for distant metastases. Due to the tumor's proximity to vital structures, it was decided to treat it with chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Nasal cavity MPNSTs are particularly uncommon, with few reported cases. They should be included in the differential diagnosis of nasal masses or recurrent nosebleeds, particularly in patients with NF-1. Careful follow-up is essential to detect early recurrence, which contributes to a better prognosis."

    "abstract": "Neovascularization is a critical process in tumor progression and malignant transformation associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Indeed, fibroblasts are known to play a key role in the tumoral microenvironment modification by producing an abundant collagenous matrix, but their contribution in paracrine communication pathways is poorly understood. Here, we hypothesized that NF1 heterozygosis in human dermal fibroblasts could promote angiogenesis through exosomes secretion. The purposes of this study are to identify the NF1 fibroblast-derived exosome protein contents and to determine their proangiogenic activity. Angiogenic proteome measurement confirmed the overexpression of VEGF and other proteins involved in vascularization. Tube formation of microvascular endothelial cells was also enhanced in presence of exosomes derived from NF1 skin fibroblasts. NF1 tissue-engineered skin (NF1-TES) generation showed a significantly denser microvessels networks compared to healthy controls. The reduction of exosomes production with an inhibitor treatment demonstrated a drastic decrease in blood vessel formation within the dermis. Our results suggest that NF1 haploinsufficiency alters the dermal fibroblast function and creates a pro-angiogenic signal via exosomes, which increases the capillary formation. This study highlights the potential of targeting exosome secretion and angiogenesis for therapeutic interventions in NF1."

To identify neurofibroma modifier genes, in order to develop a database of patients with NF1. All patients were phenotypically evaluated by a medical practitioner using a standardized questionnaire and the causal NF1 variant identified. We enrolled 1333 patients with NF1 who were genotyped for > 7 million common variants. A genome-wide association case-only study identified a significant association with 9q21.33 in the pNF phenotype in the discovery cohort. Twelve, three and four regions suggestive of association at the P ≤ 1 × 10-6 threshold were identified for pNFs, cNFs and scNFs, respectively. Evidence of replication was observed for 4, 2 and 6 loci, including 168 candidate modifier protein-coding genes. Among the candidate modifier genes, some were implicated in the RAS-mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, cell-cycle control and myelination. Using an original CRISPR/Cas9-based functional assay, we confirmed GAS1 and SPRED2 as pNF and scNF candidate modifiers, as their inactivation specifically affected NF1-mutant Schwann cell growth. Our study may shed new light on the pathogenesis of NF1-associated neurofibromas and will, hopefully, contribute to the development of personalized care for patients with this deleterious and life-threatening condition."

Our review aims to explore the established standards of care for both types of tumors, highlight the emerging therapeutic strategies for OPG treatment, and propose potential alternative therapies that, while originally studied in a broader glioma context, may hold promise for OPGs pending further investigation. These potential therapies encompass immunotherapy approaches, molecular-targeted therapy, modulation of the tumor microenvironment, nanotechnologies, magnetic hyperthermia therapy, cyberKnife, cannabinoids, and the ketogenic diet. Restoring visual function is a significant challenge in cases where optic nerve damage has occurred due to the tumor or its therapeutic interventions. Numerous approaches, particularly those involving stem cells, are currently being investigated as potential facilitators of visual recovery in these patients."

The aim of this review is to summarize recent advances that, delving into the tumor complexity, have identified new diagnostic tools and potential tumor subtype that may have been associated with clinical implications. The available data confirmed the presence of peculiar molecular signatures in those tumors, different from those observed in sporadic neoplasms and suggest that a specific reference to NF1 associated neoplasms would deserve to be mentioned in tumor WHO classification. Comprehensive multiomic analysis shows that the histologic assessment does not always match the methylation group assignment and facilitates tumor subclassification into categories predictive of clinical behavior. The non-invasive assessment of tumor genetic profiles by the analysis of plasma ctDNA is representative of tumor features, may help differential diagnosis and may identify malignant transformation, sparing the patient from repeated biopsies. A better knowledge of NF1 associated tumors at the molecular level may suggest changes in the clinical management of the disease and open new frontiers of personalized treatment."

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) is one of the most common genetically inherited disorders that affects 1 in 3000 children annually. Clinical manifestations vary widely but nearly always include the development of cutaneous, plexiform and diffuse neurofibromas that are managed over many years. Recent single-cell transcriptomics profiling efforts of neurofibromas have begun to reveal cell signaling processes. However, the cell signaling networks in mature, non-cutaneous neurofibromas remain unexplored. Here, we present insights into the cellular composition and signaling within mature neurofibromas, contrasting with normal adjacent tissue, in a porcine model of NF1 using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis and histopathological characterization. These neurofibromas exhibited classic diffuse-type histologic morphology and expected patterns of S100, SOX10, GFAP, and CD34 immunohistochemistry. The porcine mature neurofibromas closely resemble human neurofibromas histologically and contain all known cellular components of their human counterparts. The scRNA-seq confirmed the presence of all expected cell types within these neurofibromas and identified novel populations of fibroblasts and immune cells, which may contribute to the tumor microenvironment by suppressing inflammation, promoting M2 macrophage polarization, increasing fibrosis, and driving the proliferation of Schwann cells. Notably, we identified tumor-associated <i>IDO1</i> <sup>+</sup>/CD274<sup>+</sup> (<i>PD-L1)</i> <sup>+</sup> dendritic cells, which represent the first such observation in any NF1 animal model and suggest the role of the upregulation of immune checkpoints in mature neurofibromas. Finally, we observed that cell types in the tumor microenvironment are poised to promote immune evasion, extracellular matrix reconstruction, and nerve regeneration."

The most common clinical features of NF1 are pigmentary abnormalities such as café-au-lait spots and inguinal or axillary freckling, cutaneous and plexiform neurofibromas, hamartomas of the iris, optic gliomas, and bone lesions. The aim of this retrospective study was to define the clinical and molecular characteristics of a pediatric sample of NF1, as well as the mutational spectrum and genotype-phenotype correlation. The study included 40 children with clinically suspected NF1. The patients were screened for NF1 mutations by DNA-based sequencing. In addition, all the patients were studied by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) to identify any duplications or deletions in NF1. The demographic, clinical, and genetic features of the children were characterized. A total of 40 children with NF1 were included. Of those, 28 were female and 12 were male. The mean age was 8.91 years. An NF1 variant was discovered in 28 of 40 patients (70%). Among these mutations, intronic mutations were the most frequently detected mutations; 15 of these variants had not been previously reported. Only one patient had a whole NF1 gene deletion. This study expands the spectrum of mutations in the NF1 gene.

To evaluate the association of increased gadolinium enhancement with decline in VA, initiation of chemotherapy, and tumor growth, we performed a retrospective cohort study of children diagnosed with NF1-OPG between January 2006 to June 2016. Two cohorts were defined: a new diagnosis and a longitudinal cohort. Outcomes were examined at 1 and 2 years from initial diagnosis, and 1 and 2 years from initial increase in enhancement in the longitudinal cohort. Eighty patients were eligible; all 80 contributed to the new diagnosis cohort and 73 to the longitudinal cohort. Fifty-six patients (70%) demonstrated enhancing NF1-OPG at diagnosis. 39% of patients in the new diagnosis cohort and 45% of those in the longitudinal cohort developed increased enhancement during the study period. There was no significant association between increases in enhancement and VA decline in the newly diagnosed or longitudinal cohorts, as well as with initiation of treatment in the longitudinal cohort. Although there was an association of enhancement increase with treatment in the new diagnosis cohort, this association was not maintained when stratified by concurrent change in tumor size. Increased gadolinium-enhancement independent of a concurrent increase in tumor size on MRI should not be used as a marker of NF1-OPG progression and does not appear to be associated with visual decline or initiation of chemotherapy."

These individuals are burdened with lifelong surveillance monitoring organs for a wide spectrum of cancers. This is associated with substantial uncertainty and anxiety in the time between screening tests and while the individuals are awaiting results. Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) sequencing has recently shown potential as a non-invasive strategy for monitoring cancer. There is an opportunity for high-yield cancer early detection in HCS. To assess clinical validity of cfDNA in individuals with HCS, representatives from eight genetics centers from across Canada founded the CHARM (cfDNA in Hereditary and High-Risk Malignancies) Consortium in 2017. In this perspective, we discuss operationalization of this consortium and early data emerging from the most common and well-characterized HCSs: hereditary breast and ovarian cancer, Lynch syndrome, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, and Neurofibromatosis type 1. We identify opportunities for the incorporation of cfDNA sequencing into surveillance protocols; these opportunities are backed by examples of earlier cancer detection efficacy in HCSs from the CHARM Consortium. We seek to establish a paradigm shift in early cancer surveillance in individuals with HCSs, away from highly centralized, regimented medical screening visits and toward more accessible, frequent, and proactive care for these high-risk individuals."

    "abstract": "Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are aggressive soft-tissue sarcomas with a poor survival rate, presenting either sporadically or in the context of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). The histological diagnosis of MPNSTs can be challenging, with different tumors exhibiting great histological and marker expression overlap. This heterogeneity could be partly responsible for the observed disparity in treatment response due to the inherent diversity of the preclinical models used. For several years, our group has been generating a large patient-derived orthotopic xenograft (PDOX) MPNST platform for identifying new precision medicine treatments. Herein, we describe the expansion of this platform using six primary tumors clinically diagnosed as MPNSTs, from which we obtained six additional PDOX mouse models and three cell lines, thus generating three pairs of in vitro-in vivo models. We extensively characterized these tumors and derived preclinical models, including genomic, epigenomic, and histological analyses. Tumors were reclassified after these analyses: three remained as MPNSTs (two being classic MPNSTs), one was a melanoma, another was a neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase (NTRK)-rearranged spindle cell neoplasm, and, finally, the last was an unclassifiable tumor bearing neurofibromin-2 (NF2) inactivation, a neuroblastoma RAS viral oncogene homolog (NRAS) oncogenic mutation, and a SWI/SNF-related matrix-associated actin-dependent regulator of chromatin (SMARCA4) heterozygous truncated variant. New cell lines and PDOXs faithfully recapitulated histology, marker expression, and genomic characteristics of the primary tumors. The diversity in tumor identity and their specific associated genomic alterations impacted treatment responses obtained when we used the new cell lines for testing compounds against known altered pathways in MPNSTs. In summary, we present here an extension of our MPNST precision medicine platform, with new PDOXs and cell lines, including tumor entities confounded as MPNSTs in a real clinical scenario. This platform may constitute a useful tool for obtaining correct preclinical information to guide MPNST clinical trials."

Early onset scoliosis is common in patients with NF1 although severe scoliosis is rare. Scoliosis complicates the normal development and growth and may lead to thoracic insufficiency syndrome. The increased risk for breast cancer in young NF1 female patients has been recently identified. We describe a NF1 patient with dystrophic scoliosis symptoms emerged at childhood. At 37 years of age major scoliosis curve in the thoracolumbar region was 80 degrees. The patient was diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 37 years, histologically the breast cancer was ductal, hormone receptor positive and Her2-positive. A novel pathogenic variant in <i>NF1</i> p.(Trp2348*) was identified by next-generation sequencing method. The patient did not have pathogenic variants in <i>BRCA</i> genes or in other currently known hereditary breast cancer genes. Here, we describe a novel pathogenic variant in <i>NF1</i> named p.(Trp2348*) which may cause severe dystrophic scoliosis and deteriorate the quality of life and physical function, as well as Her-2 positive breast cancer. Untreated dystrophic scoliosis in patients with NF1 may result in significant spinal deformity and deteriorate the quality of life and physical function.

A woman in her forties visited her local doctor complaining of menstrual pain; a large mass was detected in her lower abdomen, and she was referred to our hospital. The patient had hundreds of skin warts and café au lait spots. The patient's mother had been diagnosed with type 1 neurofibromatosis. The patient met the diagnostic criteria for NF1 and was diagnosed with NF1. Ultrasonography showed a large heterogeneous cystic mass with various echo patterns, solid compartments and multiple septations. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a multilocular cystic mass with liquid content exhibiting various intensities, including that of blood. A small round solid mass was also observed close to the cystic tumor. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed that the round solid mass showed strong enhancement in the early phase, unlike the cystic tumor component. Open laparotomy revealed a multicystic exophytic tumor measuring 11.5 cm originating from the jejunal wall, 20 cm distal to the duodenojejunal flexure. A solid tumor measuring 2.1 cm was also found on the anal side of the large tumor. We resected the short segment of the jejunum, including the two lesions. Microscopic findings revealed that the cystic and solid tumors consisted of spindle-shaped tumor cells showing little atypia with a fascicular or bundle arrangement. Nuclear mitosis was scarce. Immunostaining of the tumor cells showed positive staining for KIT and DOG1 and negative staining for S100 and desmin. The NF1 patient was diagnosed with multiple GISTs accompanied by intratumoral hemorrhagic denaturation arising from the jejunum. The TNM staging was pT4N0M0, stage IIIA. We report a case of GISTs associated with NF1 that showed a jejunal origin, multifocal development and few mitotic figures. The recurrence risk, survival prognosis and need for adjuvant chemotherapy, particularly in cases where the initial GIST exhibits a very indolent pathology in NF1-related GISTs, remain to be elucidated."

    "abstract": "A pseudoaneurysm of the superficial temporal artery is an uncommon clinical entity that has largely been linked with direct traumatic causes. Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)-related vasculopathy is a rare cause of idiopathic arterial bleeding in the craniofacial region. A 46-year-old male with clinical features of NF1 presented to the hospital with an enlarging and tender right temporal mass without a history of trauma. Computed tomography angiography suggested the development of a pseudoaneurysm, and surgery was performed to resect the mass. Histopathological examinations showed focal interruption of the epithelium layer and elastic lamina, well-demarcated thickening of the smooth muscle layers of the arterial wall, supporting the diagnosis of pseudoaneurysm. NF1-associated vasculopathy is likely the predisposing factor for the development of a superficial temporal artery pseudoaneurysm."

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) gives rise to a variety of spinal pathologies that include dural ectasia (DE), vertebral malalignments (VMA), spinal deformities (SD), syrinx, meningoceles, spinal nerve root tumours (SNRT), and spinal plexiform tumours (SPT). The relationship between these and the progression of these pathologies has not been explored before in detail and this paper aims to address this. Data was retrospectively collected from adult NF1 multi-disciplinary team meetings from 2016 to 2022 involving a total of 593 patients with 20 distinct predictor variables. Data were analyzed utilizing; Chi-Square tests, binary logistic regression, and Kaplan-Meier analysis. SNRT (19.9%), SD (18.6%), and (17.7%) of VMA had the highest rates of progression. SD was significantly associated (p < 0.02) with the presence and progression of all spinal pathologies except for SPT. Statistically significant predictors of SD progression included the presence of DVA, VMA, syrinx, meningocele, and SNRT. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed no statistically significant difference between the times to progression for SD (85 days), SNRT (1196 days), and VMA (2243 days). This paper explores for the first time in detail, the progression of various spinal pathologies in NF1. The presence and progression of SD is a key factor that correlated with the progression of different spinal pathologies. Early identification of SD may help support clinical decision-making and guide radiological follow-up protocols and treatment."

We report the case of a girl with a clinical diagnosis of sporadic NF1 who developed a glioblastoma. Immunohistochemistry for MMR proteins identified PMS2 loss in tumour and normal cells and WES showed the tumour had an ultra-hypermutated phenotype, supporting the diagnosis of CMMRD. Germline analyses identified two variants (one pathogenic variant and one classified as variant(s) of unknown significance) in the <i>PMS2</i> gene and subsequent functional assays on blood lymphocytes confirmed the diagnosis of CMMRD. The large plexiform neurofibroma of the thigh and the freckling were however more compatible with NF1. Indeed, a <i>NF1</i> PV (variant allele frequencies of 20%, 3% and 9% and in blood, skin and saliva samples, respectively) was identified confirming a mosaicism for NF1. Retrospective analysis of a French cohort identified NF1 mosaicism in blood DNA in 2 out of 22 patients with CMMRD, underlining the existence of early postzygotic PV of <i>NF1</i> gene in patients with CMMRD whose tumours have been frequently reported to exhibit somatic <i>NF1</i> mutations. It highlights the potential role of this pathway in the pathogenesis of CMMRD-associated gliomas and argues in favour of testing MEK inhibitors in this context."

Bone-related issues, such as scoliosis, tibial dysplasia, and low bone mineral density, are a significant source of morbidity for this population with limited treatment options. Some of the challenges to developing such treatments include the lack of consensus regarding the optimal methods to assess bone health in neurofibromatosis type 1 and limited data regarding the natural history of these manifestations. In this review, the Functional Committee of the Response Evaluation in Neurofibromatosis and Schwannomatosis International Collaboration: (1) presents the available techniques for measuring overall bone health and metabolism in persons with neurofibromatosis type 1, (2) reviews data for use of each of these measures in the neurofibromatosis type 1 population, and (3) describes the strengths and limitations for each method as they might be used in clinical trials targeting neurofibromatosis type 1 bone manifestations. The Response Evaluation in Neurofibromatosis and Schwannomatosis International Collaboration supports the development of a prospective, longitudinal natural history study focusing on the bone-related manifestations and relevant biomarkers of neurofibromatosis type 1. In addition, we suggest that the neurofibromatosis type 1 research community consider adding the less burdensome measurements of bone health as exploratory endpoints in ongoing or planned clinical trials for other neurofibromatosis type 1 manifestations to expand knowledge in the field."

    "abstract": "Plexiform neurofibroma (PN) is a leading cause of morbidity in children with the genetic condition Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1), often disfiguring or threatening vital structures. During formation of PN, a complex tumor microenvironment (TME) develops, with recruitment of neoplastic and non-neoplastic cell types being critical for growth and progression. Due to the cohesive cellularity of PN, single-cell RNA-sequencing is difficult and may result in a loss of detection of critical cellular subpopulations. To bypass this barrier, we performed single-nuclei RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) on 8 frozen PN samples, and integrated this with spatial transcriptomics (ST) in 4 PN samples and immunohistochemistry to provide morphological context to transcriptomic data. SnRNA-seq analysis definitively charted the heterogeneous cellular subpopulations in the PN TME, with the predominant fraction being fibroblast subtypes. PN showed a remarkable amount of inter-sample homogeneity regarding cellular subpopulation proportions despite being resected from a variety of anatomical locations. ST analysis identified distinct cellular subpopulations which were annotated using snRNA-seq data and correlated with histological features. Schwann cell/fibroblast interactions were identified by receptor/ligand interaction analysis demonstrating a high probability of Neurexin 1/Neuroligin 1 (NRXN1/NLGN1) receptor-ligand cross-talk predicted between fibroblasts and non-myelinated Schwann cells (NM-SC) and subtypes, respectively. We observed aberrant expression of NRXN1 and NLGN1 in our PN snRNA-seq data compared to a normal mouse sciatic nerve single-cell RNA-seq dataset. This pathway has never been described in PN and may indicate a clear and direct communication pathway between putative NM-SC cells of origin and surrounding fibroblasts, potentially driving disease progression. SnRNA-seq integrated with spatial transcriptomics advances our understanding of the complex cellular heterogeneity of PN TME and identify potential novel communication pathways that may drive disease progression, a finding that could provide translational therapy options for patients with these devastating tumors of childhood and early adulthood."

Common therapeutic strategies include surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and combinations of these modalities, but despite the different treatment strategies, no actual treatment exists to prevent or revert visual impairment. Nowadays, several reports of the literature show promising results regarding NGF eye drop instillation and improvement of visual outcome. Such results seem to be related with the NGF-linked prevention in caspase activation, which reduces retinal ganglion cell loss.Reducing retinal ganglion cell loss results clinically in visual field improvement as well as visual electric potential and optical coherence tomography gain. Nonetheless, visual acuity fails to show significant changes.Visual impairment represents nowadays one of the major issues in dealing with OPGs. Secondary to the interesting results offered by NGF eye drop administration, further studies are warranted to better comprehend potential treatment strategies."

Animal studies have showed that statins, through the inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, can affect the Ras/MAPK pathway, thus providing impetus to examine the efficacy of statins in the pediatric population with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). We aimed to systematically address all relevant evidence of statin treatment in children with NF1. We searched PubMed and Cochrane Library resources up to 2 June 2023 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) written in English and evaluating statins versus placebo in children with NF1 (PROSPERO registration number: CRD42023439424). Seven RCTs were suitable to be included in this qualitative synthesis, with a total participation of 336 children with NF1. The duration of the studies ranged from 12 to 52 weeks. The mean age of the pediatric population was 10.9 years old. Three studies investigated the role of simvastatin, while four studies examined lovastatin. According to our analysis, neither simvastatin nor lovastatin improved cognitive function, full-scale intelligence, school performance, attention problems, or internalizing behavioral problems when compared with placebo in children with NF1. Statins were well tolerated in all included RCTs. Although safe, current evidence demonstrates that statins exert no beneficial effect in cognitive function and behavioral problems in children with NF1."

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (Nf1) is a neurodevelopmental disorder and tumor syndrome caused by loss of function mutations in the neurofibromin gene (<i>Nf1</i>) and is estimated to affect 100,000 people in the US. Behavioral alterations and cognitive deficits have been found in 50-70% of children with Nf1 and include specific problems with attention, visual perception, language, learning, attention, and executive function. These behavioral alterations and cognitive deficits are observed in the absence of tumors or macroscopic structural abnormalities in the central nervous system. No effective treatments for the behavioral and cognitive disabilities of Nf1 exist. Inhibition of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (Alk), a kinase which is negatively regulated by neurofibromin, allows for testing the hypothesis that this inhibition may be therapeutically beneficial in Nf1. In this review, we discuss this area of research and directions for the development of alternative therapeutic strategies to inhibit Alk. Even if the incidence of adverse reactions of currently available Alk inhibitors was reduced to half the dose, we anticipate that a long-term treatment would pose challenges for efficacy, safety, and tolerability. Therefore, future efforts are warranted to investigate alternative, potentially less toxic and more specific strategies to inhibit Alk function."

In this study, we characterized whether transcriptomic signatures of T-cell dysfunction (TCD) and exclusion (TCE) that inversely correlate with response to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) immunotherapy exist in MPNSTs. MPNST transcriptomes were pooled from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). For each sample, a tumor immune dysfunction and exclusion (TIDE) score, TCD and TCE subscores, and cytotoxic T-cell(CTL) level were calculated. In the TIDE predictive algorithm, tumors are predicted to have an ICB response if they are either immunologically hot (CTL-high) without TCD or immunologically cold (CTL-low) without TCE. TIDE scores greater than zero correspond with ICB nonresponse. 73 MPNST samples met inclusion criteria, including 50 NF1-associated MPNSTs (68.5%). The average TIDE score was + 0.41 (SD = 1.16) with 22 (30.1%) predicted ICB responders. 11 samples were CTL-high (15.1%) with an average TCD score of + 0.99 (SD = 0.63). Among 62 CTL-low tumors, 21 were predicted to have ICB response with an average TCE score of + 0.31(SD = 1.20). Age(p = 0.18), sex(p = 0.41), NF1 diagnosis (p = 0.17), and PRC2 loss(p = 0.29) were not associated with ICB responder status. Transcriptomic analysis of TCD and TCE signatures in MPNST samples reveals that a select subset of patients with MPNSTs may benefit from ICB immunotherapy."

Neurofibromatosis type 1, caused by the occurrence of heterozygous pathogenic NF1 variants, is a good model for studying the evolution of VUS, due to the widespread use of genetic testing for the disease, the constant enrichment of the international databases with NF1 variants and the full adult penetrance of the disease, which makes genotyping the parents a crucial step in the diagnostic workflow. The present study retrospectively reviewed and reinterpreted the genetic test results of NF1 in a diagnostic genetic laboratory in the period from January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2020. All the VUS were reinterpreted using the 2015 consensus standards and guidelines for the interpretation. Out of 589 NF1 genetic tests which were performed in the period, a total of 85 VUS were found and reinterpreted in 72 cases (84.7%): 21 (29.2%) were reclassified as benign/likely benign, whereas 51 (70.8%) were recoded as pathogenic/likely pathogenic with a significant trend distribution (Chi square test for trend p = 0.005). Synonymous VUS have mainly been reclassified as class 1 and 2 (7/8, 87.5%), whereas missense variants have been attributed to class 4 and 5 in 38 out of the 58 cases (65.5%). These findings underline an improvement in the classification of variants over time, suggesting that a reinterpretation of the genetic tests should be routinely performed to support the physicians in the clinical diagnosis of genetic diseases."

Brain focal areas of T2w increased signal intensity on MRI, the so-called Unidentified Bright Objects (UBOs) have been hypothesized to be related to cognitive dysfunction, although conflicting results are available in literature. Here, we investigated the possible relation between UBOs' volume, cognitive impairment, and language disability in NF1 patients. In this retrospective study, clinical and MRI data of 21 NF1 patients (M/F = 12/9; mean age 10.1 ± 4.5) were evaluated. Brain intellectual functioning and language abilities were assessed with specific scales, while the analyzed MRI sequences included axial 2D-T2-weighted and FLAIR sequences. These images were used independently for UBOs segmentation with a semiautomatic approach and obtained volumes were normalized for biparietal diameters to take into account for brain volume. Possible differences in terms of normalized UBOs volumes were probed between cognitively affected and preserved patients, as well as between subjects with or without language impairment. Patients cognitively affected were not different in terms of UBOs volume compared to those preserved (p = 0.35 and p = 0.30, for T2-weighted and FLAIR images, respectively). Similarly, no differences were found between patients with and without language impairment (p = 0.47 and p = 0.40, for the two sequences). The relation between UBOs and cognition in children with NF1 has been already investigated in literature, although leading to conflicting results. Our study expands the current knowledge, showing a lack of correlation between UBOs volume and both cognitive impairment and language disability in NF1 patients."

The occurrence of neurofibromas can be very stressful for patients and often contributes to a reduced quality of life for patients, especially if externally visible body parts are affected. The aim of this study is to show to what extent the resection of cutaneous neurofibromas can improve patients' quality of life. For this study, we conducted a retrospective data collection via questionnaire on the quality of life before and after the surgical removal of cutaneous neurofibromas at the Department of Dermatology, University Hospital of Tübingen. An adapted dermatological quality of life index and a postoperative questionnaire on patient satisfaction were used. In addition, patient data were taken from doctor's notes, surgical reports, and outpatient documentation. A total of 30 patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 who underwent inpatient or outpatient surgery for cutaneous neurofibromas at the Tübingen dermatology hospital between 2016 and 2020 were surveyed. The survey results were statistically analyzed and represented as absolute and relative frequencies. Our study indicates an improved quality of life after surgery for cutaneous neurofibromas, especially regarding limitations in everyday life, self-consciousness, the choice of clothing, and leisure activities. The majority of our patients showed no new occurrence of neurofibromas in the surgical area and postoperative bleeding or wound infections were rare. In relation to the high level of satisfaction with the surgical and cosmetic results and also the positive influence on quality of life, our study indicates a favorable risk-benefit ratio for the resection of cutaneous neurofibromas in neurofibromatosis I."

Wounds in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) become inconspicuous and lack the tendency to form abnormal scars. We hypothesized that there would be a unique response to mechanical stimulation and subsequent scar formation in NF1. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the molecular mechanisms of differentiation into myofibroblasts in NF1-derived fibroblasts and neurofibromin-depleted fibroblasts and examined actin dynamics, which is involved in fibroblast differentiation, with a focus on the pathway linking LIMK2/cofilin to actin dynamics. In normal fibroblasts, expression of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), a marker of myofibroblasts, significantly increased after mechanical stimulation, whereas in NF1-derived and neurofibromin-depleted fibroblasts, α-SMA expression did not change. Phosphorylation of cofilin and subsequent actin polymerization did not increase in NF1-derived and neurofibromin-depleted fibroblasts after mechanical stimulation. Finally, in normal fibroblasts treated with Jasplakinolide, an actin stabilizer, α-SMA expression did not change after mechanical stimulation. Therefore, when neurofibromin was dysfunctional or depleted, subsequent actin polymerization did not occur in response to mechanical stimulation, which may have led to the unchanged expression of α-SMA. We believe this molecular pathway can be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of abnormal scars."

The clinical image is characterized by the presence of the sustained hypertension, headaches, sweating, palpitations. The symptoms are caused by the catecholamine secretion or are related to tumor mass pressure on different organs. The catecholamines and their metabolites levels in urine collection or plasma are necessary for further evaluation of the diagnosis. In pediatric population the tumors occur in multiple familial syndromes such as Multiple Endocrine type 2, Neurofibromatosis type 1, Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome, Familial Paraganglioma syndrome are related to specific mutations (SDHx, RET, VHL, NF1) leading to the characteristic phenotype. The radiological and nuclear imaging are an important part of the examination. Although CT and MR are reported to have overall good sensitivity for the tumor detection, further analysis with nuclear imaging is recommended for the specified diagnosis. Right now 68GA-DOTATATE is regarded as the tracer of choice, leading to the complex evaluation of patients with different mutations and metastatic disease. The treatment of choice is the tumor excision.

Using human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) cerebral organoid modeling of the 1.4 megabase Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) deletion syndrome, we previously discovered that the cytokine receptor-like factor-3 (CRLF3) gene, which is co-deleted with the NF1 gene, functions as a major regulator of neuronal maturation. Moreover, children with NF1 and the CRLF3L389P variant have greater autism burden, suggesting that this gene might be important for neurologic function. To explore the functional consequences of this variant, we generated CRLF3L389P-mutant hiPSC lines and Crlf3L389P-mutant genetically engineered mice. While this variant does not impair protein expression, brain structure, or mouse behavior, CRLF3L389P-mutant human cerebral organoids and mouse brains exhibit impaired neuronal maturation and dendrite formation. In addition, Crlf3L389P-mutant mouse neurons have reduced dendrite lengths and branching, without any axonal deficits. Moreover, Crlf3L389P-mutant mouse hippocampal neurons have decreased firing rates and synaptic current amplitudes relative to wild type controls. Taken together, these findings establish the CRLF3L389P variant as functionally deleterious and suggest that it may be a neurodevelopmental disease modifier."

Cell culture models and mouse models of NF1 are being used to test drug efficacy in preclinical trials, which led to Food and Drug Administration approval for use of MEK inhibitors to shrink most inoperable plexiform neurofibromas. This article details methods used for testing in preclinical models, and outlines newer models that may identify additional, curative, strategies."

Even though some cases are sporadic, they have been connected to syndromes such as von Hippel-Lindau, multiple endocrine neoplasia types IIa and IIb, neurofibromatosis type 1, and hereditary pheochromocytoma-paraganglioma syndromes. A genetic mutation causes around 60% of pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas in children under 18. <b>Methods:</b> A 15-y-old child with a 6-y history of back discomfort is presented. The justification for using 2 functional imaging modalities, <sup>68</sup>Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT and <sup>123</sup>I-<i>meta</i>-iodobenzylguanidine SPECT/CT, is examined in this case study. We reviewed the patients' journey since the first referral for imaging. <b>Results:</b> Delaying the molecular imaging modalities has affected patients' overall diagnosis and applied treatment outcomes. <b>Conclusion:</b> This case study investigates the potential for the earlier use of various diagnostic modalities in conjunction with diagnostic testing to facilitate an earlier diagnosis. However, since this study is based solely on imaging and lacks access to the patient's clinical or family history, factors such as potential inequities in health-care facilities, health literacy, and socioeconomic status are not addressed. It is essential to acknowledge these influences as they contribute to the inequitable access to health-care settings in New Zealand."

Τhey are characterized by low mortality albeit with significant morbidity. We present the characteristics, management, and outcome of 23 OPG patients (16 females, median age: 4.8 y) managed in a Pediatric Oncology Department in Northern Greece over a 25-year period. Overall, 57% had a background of neurofibromatosis type 1. Diagnosis was based on imaging (10 patients) or biopsy (13 patients). Presenting symptoms were mostly visual impairment/squint (52%). Proptosis/exophthalmos, raised intracranial pressure, and headache were also noted. In 2 occasions, it was detected with surveillance magnetic resonance imaging in the context of neurofibromatosis type 1. Eight patients had unilateral and 2 bilateral optic nerve tumors (Modified Dodge Classification, stage 1a/1b), 3 had chiasmatic (stage 2a/b), and 10 had multiple tumors (stage 3/4). Predominant histology was pilocytic astrocytoma (77%). Management included: observation (4), chemotherapy only (9), surgery only (3), or various combinations (7). Chemotherapy regimens included vincristine and carboplatin, vinblastine, or bevacizumab with irinotecan. Most patients demonstrated a slow disease course with complete response/partial response to chemotherapy and/or surgery, whereas 39% presented ≥1 recurrences. After a median follow-up of 8.5 years (range to 19 y), 20 patients (87%) are still alive with stable disease, in partial/complete remission, or on treatment."

    "abstract": "Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are deadly sarcomas, which desperately need effective therapies. Half of all MPNSTs arise in patients with neurofibromatosis type I (NF1), a common inherited disease. NF1 patients can develop benign lesions called plexiform neurofibromas (PNFs), often in adolescence, and over time, some PNFs, but not all, will transform into MPNSTs. A deeper understanding of the molecular and genetic alterations driving PNF-MPNST transformation will guide development of more targeted and effective treatments for these patients. This review focuses on an oncogenic transcription factor, FOXM1, which is a powerful oncogene in other cancers but little studied in MPNSTs. Elevated expression of FOXM1 was seen in patient MPNSTs and correlated with poor survival, but otherwise, its role in the disease is unknown. We discuss what is known about FOXM1 in MPNSTs relative to other cancers and how FOXM1 may be regulated by and/or regulate the most commonly altered players in MPNSTs, particularly in the MEK and CDK4/6 kinase pathways. We conclude by considering FOXM1, MEK, and CDK4/6 as new, clinically relevant targets for MPNST therapy."

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a clinically heterogeneous neurocutaneous disorder inherited in autosomal dominant manner. Approximately 5-10% of the cases are caused by <i>NF1</i> microdeletions involving the <i>NF1</i> gene and its flanking regions. Microdeletions, which lead to more severe clinical manifestations, can be subclassified into four different types (type 1, 2, 3 and atypical) according to their size, the genomic location of the breakpoints and the number of genes included within the deletion. Besides the prominent hallmarks of NF1, patients with <i>NF1</i> microdeletions frequently exhibit specific additional clinical manifestations like dysmorphic facial features, macrocephaly, overgrowth, global developmental delay, cognitive disability and an increased risk of malignancies. It is important to identify the genes co-deleted with <i>NF1</i>, because they are likely to have an effect on the clinical manifestation. Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) and microarray analysis are the primary techniques for the investigation of <i>NF1</i> microdeletions. However, based on previous research, optical genome mapping (OGM) could also serve as an alternative method to identify copy number variations (CNVs). Here, we present a case with <i>NF1</i> microdeletion identified by means of OGM and demonstrate that this novel technology is a suitable tool for the identification and classification of the <i>NF1</i> microdeletions."

The ocular diagnostic hallmarks of this disease include iris Lisch nodules, ocular and eyelid neurofibromas, eyelid café-au-lait spots and optic pathway gliomas (OPGs). In the last years, new manifestations have been identified in the ocular district in NF1 including choroidal abnormalities (CAs), hyperpigmented spots (HSs) and retinal vascular abnormalities (RVAs). Recent advances in multi-modality imaging in ophthalmology have allowed for the improved characterization of these clinical signs. Accordingly, CAs, easily detectable as bright patchy nodules on near-infrared imaging, have recently been added to the revised diagnostic criteria for NF1 due to their high specificity and sensitivity. Furthermore, subclinical alterations of the visual pathways, regardless of the presence of OPGs, have been recently described in NF1, with a primary role of neurofibromin in the myelination process. In this paper, we reviewed the latest progress in the understanding of choroidal and retinal abnormalities in NF1 patients. The clinical significance of the recently revised diagnostic criteria for NF1 is discussed along with new updates in molecular diagnosis. New insights into NF1-related neuro-ophthalmic manifestations are also provided based on electrophysiological and optical coherence tomography (OCT) studies."

    "abstract": "Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumors (MPNSTs) are derived from Schwann cells or their precursors. In patients with the tumor susceptibility syndrome neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), MPNSTs are the most common malignancy and the leading cause of death. These rare and aggressive soft-tissue sarcomas offer a stark future, with 5-year disease-free survival rates of 34-60%. Treatment options for individuals with MPNSTs are disappointingly limited, with disfiguring surgery being the foremost treatment option. Many once-promising therapies such as tipifarnib, an inhibitor of Ras signaling, have failed clinically. Likewise, phase II clinical trials with erlotinib, which targets the epidermal growth factor (EFGR), and sorafenib, which targets the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGF), platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGF), and Raf, in combination with standard chemotherapy, have also failed to produce a response in patients. In recent years, functional genomic screening methods combined with genetic profiling of cancer cell lines have proven useful for identifying essential cytoplasmic signaling pathways and the development of target-specific therapies. In the case of rare tumor types, a variation of this approach known as cross-species comparative oncogenomics is increasingly being used to identify novel therapeutic targets. In cross-species comparative oncogenomics, genetic profiling and functional genomics are performed in genetically engineered mouse (GEM) models and the results are then validated in the rare human specimens and cell lines that are available. This paper describes how to identify candidate driver gene mutations in human and mouse MPNST cells using whole exome sequencing (WES). We then describe how to perform genome-scale shRNA screens to identify and compare critical signaling pathways in mouse and human MPNST cells and identify druggable targets in these pathways. These methodologies provide an effective approach to identifying new therapeutic targets in a variety of human cancer types."

    "abstract": "Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are malignancies that arise or differentiate from or infiltrate peripheral nerves and account for approximately 5% of soft-tissue malignancies. Approximately half of MPNSTs develop in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), a hereditary disease. MPNSTs occur mainly in the trunk, proximal extremities, and neck, but can on rare occasion arise in or near the gastrointestinal tract, and intestinal complications have been reported. We describe herein a case with resection of an MPNST arising in the pelvic region. A 51-year-old woman had undergone repeated resections for systemic neurofibrosis associated with NF1. This time, a pelvic tumor was noted on follow-up positron emission tomography computed tomography (CT). She presented with slowly progressive radiating pain in the lower extremities and was referred to our hospital for tumor resection. Contrast-enhanced CT showed a 75 × 58-mm mass in the right greater sciatic foramen directly below a 24 × 28-mm mass. Open pelvic tumor resection was performed for pelvic neurofibroma. The obturator nerve was identified lateral to the main tumor and the sciatic nerve was identified dorsally, then dissection was performed. The closed nerve was spared, while the sciatic nerve was partially dissected and the two tumors were removed. Both tumors were elastic and hard. Pathologic findings were MPNST for the large specimen and neurofibroma with atypia for the small specimen. The patient developed temporary postoperative ileus, but is generally doing well and is currently free of recurrence or radiating pain. The patient is at high risk of recurrence and close monitoring should be continued. We encountered a rare case of MPNST. Due to the high risk of recurrence, surgery with adequate margins was performed, with a requirement for appropriate follow-up."

EnVision immunostaining and next-generation sequencing (NGS) were used to examine their immunophenotypical characteristics and genomic aberrations, respectively. <b>Results:</b> There were 10 males and 13 females, with an age range of 11 to 79 years (median 36 years), including 14 cases of neurofibromatosis type I-associated MPNST and 9 cases of sporadic MPNST. The tumors were located in extremities (7 cases), trunk (4 cases), neck and shoulder (3 cases), chest cavity (3 cases), paraspinal area (2 cases), abdominal cavity (2 cases), retroperitoneum (1 case), and pelvic cavity (1 case). Morphologically, the tumors were composed of dense spindle cells arranged in fascicles. Periphery neurofibroma-like pattern was found in 73.9% (17/23) of the cases. Under low magnification, alternating hypercellular and hypocellular areas resembled marbled appearance. Under high power, the tumor cell nuclei were irregular, presenting with oval, conical, comma-like, bullet-like or wavy contour. In 7 cases, the tumor cells demonstrated marked cytological pleomorphism and rare giant tumor cells. The mitotic figures were commonly not less than 3/10 HPF, and geographic necrosis was often noted. Immunohistochemically, tumor cells were positive for S-100 (14/23, 60.9%) and SOX10 (11/23, 47.8%). The loss of the CD34-positive fibroblastic network encountered in neurofibromas was observed in 14/17 of the MPNST cases. The loss of H3K27me3 expression was observed in 82.6% (19/23) of the cases. Moreover, SDHA and SDHB losses were presented in one case. NGS revealed that NF1 gene loss of function (germline or somatic) were found in all 5 cases tested. Furthermore, four cases accompanied with somatic mutations of SUZ12 gene and half of them had somatic mutations of TP53 gene, while one case with germline mutation in SDHA gene and somatic mutations in FAT1, BRAF, and KRAS genes. Available clinical follow-up was obtained in 19 cases and ranged from 1 to 67 months. Four patients died of the disease, all of whom had the clinical history of neurofibromatosis type Ⅰ. <b>Conclusions:</b> MPNST is difficult to be differentiated from a variety of spindle cell tumors due to its wide spectrum of histological morphology and complex genetic changes. H3K27me3 is a useful diagnostic marker, while the loss of CD34 positive fibroblastic network can also be a diagnostic feature of MPNST. NF1 gene inactivation mutations and complete loss of PRC2 activity are the common molecular diagnostic features, but other less commonly recurred genomic aberrations might also contribute to the MPNST pathogenesis."

The preferred treatment for affected patients is surgical resection, which typically improves symptoms and accompanies a low likelihood of tumor recurrence. We conducted a systematic review of reports of GNs involving the spinal cord and nerve roots, examining their clinical presentation, surgical management, and outcomes. Using the keywords \"ganglioneuroma\" and \"spinal,\" we conducted a systematic database review of MEDLINE (PubMed), Scopus, and Embase, querying studies reporting cases of spinal GNs. Patients' demographics, location of the tumors, clinical features, and surgical outcomes were extracted from eligible articles. A total of 93 spinal GN cases in 52 case reports/series met our criteria. Data analysis revealed a general male predominance, though thoracic spinal GNs were seen more in females. The mean age of patients with cervical, thoracic, thoracolumbar, and lumbar spinal GNs were 41.28, 27.65, 15.61, and 38.73 years, respectively. Multiple-level GNs were mostly seen in male patients or individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1. In all but 1 case, recurrence and reoperation were not reported in the short-term (months) and long-term (2-10 years) follow-up. We found unique epidemiologic characteristics for patients with GNs of different spinal regions. The treatment of choice is achieving gross total resection, but given the eloquency of the lesions, achieving decompression via subtotal resection can also be associated with improved outcomes. To date, no global postoperative surveillance protocol exists, considering the low recurrence rate and relevant cost-benefit ratios."

In addition, revised diagnostic criteria for NF1 were proposed by NF1 experts of an international panel in 2021. Because the overall degree of severity and manifestations in each patient are not predictable, age-specific annual monitoring and patient education by a multidisciplinary team are important for the management of NF1.

    "abstract": "The neurofibromatosis-1 gene (<i>NF1</i>) was initially characterized because its germline mutation is responsible for an inherited syndromic disease predisposing tumor development, in particular neurofibromas but also various malignancies. Recently, large-scale tumor sequencing efforts have demonstrated <i>NF1</i> as one of the most frequently mutated genes in human cancer, being mutated in approximately 5-10% of all tumors, especially in malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors and different skin tumors. <i>NF1</i> acts as a tumor suppressor gene that encodes neurofibromin, a large protein that controls neoplastic transformation through several molecular mechanisms. On the other hand, neurofibromin loss due to <i>NF1</i> biallelic inactivation induces tumorigenic hyperactivation of Ras and mTOR signaling pathways. Moreover, neurofibromin controls actin cytoskeleton structure and the metaphase-anaphase transition. Consequently, neurofibromin deficiency favors cell mobility and proliferation as well as chromosomal instability and aneuploidy, respectively. Growing evidence supports the role of oxidative stress in <i>NF1</i>-related tumorigenesis. Neurofibromin loss induces oxidative stress both directly and through Ras and mTOR signaling activation. Notably, innovative therapeutic approaches explore drug combinations that further increase reactive oxygen species to boost the oxidative unbalance of <i>NF1</i>-altered cancer cells. In our paper, we review <i>NF1</i>-related tumors and their pathogenesis, highlighting the twofold contribution of oxidative stress, both tumorigenic and therapeutic."

To explore the differential genetic expression profile, Gene Ontology terms, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways in human trabecular bone (HTB)-derived cells of dystrophic scoliosis secondary to neurofibromatosis type 1 (DS-NF1) and compare these to normal controls. The pathogenesis of DS-NF1 and the accompanying generalized osteopenia remain unclear. We hypothesized that HTBs may play a significant role in the etiology and pathogenesis of DS-NF1. Microarray analysis was used to identify differentially expressed genes of HTBs from patients with DS-NF1 compared with those from healthy individuals. Functional and pathway enrichment analysis were implemented through Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway database. Then, the \"search tool for the retrieval of interacting genes/proteins\" database, Cytoscape, and \"Molecular Complex Detection\" were applied to construct the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and screen hub genes. Pathway enrichment analysis was further performed for hub genes and gene clusters identified through module analysis. Six potential crucial genes were selected for validation by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that there are 401 previously unrecognized differentially expressed genes (238 up and 163 downregulated genes) in HTBs from patients with DS-NF1, and they were mainly enriched in terms of immune response, type-I interferon (IFN) signaling, TNF signaling pathway and etinoic acid inducible gene I-like receptor signaling pathway. Five hub genes, including signal transducer and activator of transcription 1, 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase-like, IFN induced with helicase C domain 1, IFN regulatory factor 7, and MX dynamin-like GTPase 1 were identified through PPI network, which were mainly enriched in terms of Jak-STAT and etinoic acid inducible gene I-like receptor signaling pathway. An independently dysregulated protein cluster containing CCL2, CXCL1, CXCL3, CX3CL1, TLR1 , and CXCL12 was also identified through the PPI network. This indicated that the upper abnormally expressed genes may play essential roles in DS-NF1 pathogenesis and accompanied osteopenia. Six key genes were identified in the progression of DS-NF1-related osteopenia. Immune response might play a key role in the progression of osteopenia, whereas a CXCL12 -mediated osteogenic effect might play a protective role."

Relative to typically developing children, the NF1 group displayed higher resting state slow wave power and a lower peak alpha frequency. Moreover, higher theta power and frontoparietal theta phase coherence were observed in the NF1 group during working memory task performance, but these differences disappeared when controlling for baseline (resting state) activity. Overall, results suggest that NF1 is characterised by aberrant resting state oscillatory activity that may contribute towards the cognitive impairments experienced in this population.

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a multisystem disorder that primarily affects the skin and peripheral nervous system and is caused by chromosomal abnormalities and mostly truncating variants in the <i>NF1</i> gene. Ocular complications such as Lisch nodules and optic pathway gliomas (OPGs) can occur in NF1 patients. Herein, we report a novel <i>NF1</i> variant in an NF1 patient with bilateral optic atrophy. Ophthalmological examinations and genetic analyses were performed using targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS). A 14-year-old girl diagnosed with NF1 visited our hospital with decreased visual acuity (VA). The patient had no family history of NF1 or visual impairment. Brain and orbital magnetic resonance imaging revealed no remarkable findings. Ophthalmoscopy revealed temporal pallor of the optic discs, which was confirmed by optical coherence tomography findings of significant thinning of the circumpapillary retinal nerve fiber layer in both eyes. At 23 years of age, the decimal-corrected VA had deteriorated to 0.2 in the right eye and 0.1 in the left eye. Additionally, the targeted NGS panel revealed a novel heterozygous stop-gain variant (p.Tyr628Ter) in the <i>NF1</i> gene; however, no pathogenic variants in <i>OPA1</i> or the mitochondrial DNA were identified. A patient with NF1 without OPGs developed bilateral optic atrophy and carried a novel <i>de novo</i> stop-gain variant of <i>NF1</i>. Although the relationship between <i>NF1</i> variants and bilateral optic atrophy remains unclear, further investigations are required."

    "title": "Successful endovascular management for spontaneous hemothorax in a patient with neurofibromatosis Type1: A case report and review.",
    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) is a rare autosomal dominant genetic disorder that affects multiple organs and systems, including the nervous system, integumentary system, and connective tissues. Spontaneous hemothorax occurs infrequently in patients with NF1 and is associated with high fatality rates. However, it is commonly overlooked or misdiagnosed. We present the case of a 29-year-old woman with NF1 who complained of chest pain and was detected with hemothorax on radiographic examination. No bleeding sites were identified following thrombectomy. The patient's condition deteriorated with conservative treatment over nine days, posing a potentially life-threatening risk. After a diagnostic evaluation using computerized tomography angiography (CTA) and digital subtraction angiography (DSA) of the neck vasculature, the patient was diagnosed with spontaneous rupture of the vertebral artery (VA) and subclavian artery (SuA) aneurysm. Following a multidisciplinary discussion and extensive investigations, the patient underwent successful endovascular treatment. A VIABAHN covered stent was implanted in the left SuA to overlay the emergent orifice. The endovascular treatment challenge due to the inaccessible of the proximal of left VA. To prevent retrograde flow into the VA aneurysm, the coils were used to embolize the left VA via the right vertebral artery-basilar artery (VA-BA) passage. The patient was alive at the 5-year follow-up without further complications. The CTA examination led to the diagnosis of vascular rupture due to NF1, and endovascular treatment was performed to occlude the vascular lumen. There have been no recurrences during the five-year follow-up period. Vasculopathy is the second leading cause of death in patients with NF1 after malignancy. Early diagnosis of spontaneous hemothorax in patients with NF1 is crucial, as misdiagnosis can result in missed treatment opportunities. CTA plays a vital role in preliminarily diagnosing the cause of spontaneous hemothorax, while endovascular treatment offers a new therapeutic option for such patients."

    "abstract": "Knowledge about the prevalence and tumor types of CDKN2A-related melanoma-astrocytoma syndrome (MAS) is limited and could improve disease recognition. To estimate the prevalence and describe the tumor types of MAS. This retrospective cohort study analyzed all available MAS cases from medical centers in the US (2 sites) and Europe (2 sites) and from biomedical population genomic databases (UK Biobank [United Kingdom], Geisinger MyCode [US]) between January 1, 1976, and December 31, 2020. Patients with MAS with CDKN2A germline pathogenic variants and 1 or more neural tumors were included. Data were analyzed from June 1, 2022, to January 31, 2023. Disease prevalence and tumor frequency. Prevalence of MAS ranged from 1 in 170 503 (n = 1 case; 95% CI, 1:30 098-1:965 887) in Geisinger MyCode (n = 170 503; mean [SD] age, 58.9 [19.1] years; 60.6% women; 96.2% White) to 1 in 39 149 (n = 12 cases; 95% CI, 1:22 396-1:68 434) in UK Biobank (n = 469 789; mean [SD] age, 70.0 [8.0] years; 54.2% women; 94.8% White). Among UK Biobank patients with MAS (n = 12) identified using an unbiased genomic ascertainment approach, brain neoplasms (4 of 12, 33%; 1 glioblastoma, 1 gliosarcoma, 1 astrocytoma, 1 unspecified type) and schwannomas (3 of 12, 25%) were the most common malignant and benign neural tumors, while cutaneous melanoma (2 of 12, 17%) and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (2 of 12, 17%) were the most common nonneural malignant neoplasms. In a separate case series of 14 patients with MAS from the US and Europe, brain neoplasms (4 of 14, 29%; 2 glioblastomas, 2 unspecified type) and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (2 of 14, 14%) were the most common neural cancers, while cutaneous melanoma (4 of 14, 29%) and sarcomas (2 of 14, 14%; 1 liposarcoma, 1 unspecified type) were the most common nonneural cancers. Cutaneous neurofibromas (7 of 14, 50%) and schwannomas (2 of 14, 14%) were also common. In 1 US family, a father and son with MAS had clinical diagnoses of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Genetic testing of the son detected a pathogenic CDKN2A splicing variant (c.151-1G>C) and was negative for NF1 genetic alterations. In UK Biobank, 2 in 150 (1.3%) individuals with clinical NF1 diagnoses had likely pathogenic variants in CDKN2A, including 1 individual with no detected variants in the NF1 gene. This cohort study estimates the prevalence and describes the tumors of MAS. Additional studies are needed in genetically diverse populations to further define population prevalence and disease phenotypes."

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant disease that affects the development and growth of various tissues. NF1 is a major risk factor for the development of malignancies, particularly malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, optic gliomas, and leukemia. NF1 encodes a neurofibromin. Three genes, EVI2A, EVI2B, and OMGP, are embedded within intron 27b of NF1. However, the function of these genes remains unclear. EVI2A and EVI2B encode for putative transmembrane proteins. Mouse homologs are associated with viral insertions involved in leukemia in mice. Mouse Evi2b has been identified as a direct target gene of C/EBPα, a transcription factor critical for myeloid differentiation. Also possible is that these genes are related to the leukemia observed in patients with NF1. These genes might act as modifiers of NF1 phenotypic variations. Therefore, we investigated the EVI2B gene in leukemia and NF1 tumors. We analyzed DNA from 10, 20, and 3 patients with NF1, leukemia, and NF1-leukemia, respectively, and six NF1 tumor tissues. DNA sequencing analysis was used to identify the viral integration sequence, and the protein amounts and EVI2B gene expression were analyzed by flow cytometry and quantitative real-time PCR techniques. The EVI2B gene expression was increased in cutaneous neurofibroma compared with the control both at the level of protein and mRNA. However, its expression in plexiform neurofibroma was decreased significantly at protein level and increased at mRNA level compare to control. Moreover, integration of 455 bases near the 3' end of the exon was detected. When this integrated sequence was blasted into the NCBI retroviral genome database, an 87% match with the HIV-1 virus envelope gene was obtained. These preliminary results show that EVI2B might be important in NF1 tumorigenesis and leukemia."

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 ( NF1 ) is commonly mutated in melanoma, yet the risk of melanoma in individuals with NF1 is incompletely understood. We performed a systematic review to investigate the risk and characteristics of melanoma and melanocytic nevi in NF1 individuals. PubMed was searched for articles describing NF1 individuals with melanoma, or melanocytic nevi. Those with cutaneous and ocular melanomas were compared to the general population using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data. Fifty-three articles describing 188 NF1 patients were included (melanoma n = 82, melanocytic nevi n = 93, melanocytic nevi, and melanoma n = 13). Compared to the general population, NF1 patients with cutaneous melanomas had earlier melanoma diagnoses (49.1 vs. 58.6 years, P = 0.012), thicker tumors (3.7 vs. 1.2 mm, P = 0.006), and more frequent disease-specific deaths (27.3% vs. 8.6%, P = 0.005) with shorter survival (12.9 vs. 34.2 months, P = 0.011). Ocular melanomas made up 15.0% of all melanomas in NF1 patients versus 1.5% in the general population ( P < 0.001). In pooling all population-based studies describing melanoma in NF1 populations, NF1 individuals had 2.55 higher odds of having melanoma compared to the general population. A nevus spilus was commonly reported among NF1 individuals with nevi (44.8%, 39/87). Our findings suggest that NF1 individuals may have a higher risk for developing melanomas and tend to have thicker melanomas and worse survival compared to the general population, highlighting the importance of cutaneous and ophthalmologic surveillance in NF1 patients. Our review also supports the association between NF1 and nevus spilus."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Neurofibromatosis 1 is a neurocutaneous disorder with multisystemic manifestations. When patients are lacking overt cutaneous manifestations, diagnosis may be delayed and may complicate diagnosis and management of atypical presentations of this disease. It is thus important to strive to obtain relevant and/or complete history to arrive at the appropriate diagnosis. Furthermore, maintaining an index of suspicion in cases of vague abdominal pain may guide the clinician in establishing the correct diagnosis of mesenteric plexiform neurofibroma in the setting of known/presumed neurofibromatosis 1 patients presenting with acute and/or chronic vague abdominal symptoms. CASE REPORT This is a case of a teenage boy who presented with acute, vague abdominal pain over a period of 2 weeks. Laboratory tests and physical exam findings in primary and secondary care settings were unremarkable, and thus the patient was discharged home only to continue with abdominal pain, thus seeking additional medical care. After admission to our facility and exhaustive history taking, physical examination, and imaging, a prospective diagnosis of neurofibromatosis with mesenteric neurofibroma was made. Upon surgical exploration, a mesenteric mass with corresponding volvulized, ischemic small bowel was removed. Histopathology confirmed a plexiform neurofibroma. The patient recovered adequately and was discharged home without complications. CONCLUSIONS This case highlights the importance of exhaustive history taking to obtain an accurate diagnosis as well as the importance of a high index of clinical suspicion for mesenteric neurofibromatosis in patients with presumed or known neurofibromatosis and presenting with vague abdominal symptoms."

    "abstract": "Plexiform neurofibromas occurring in approximately 20-50% of all neurofibromatosis type-1 (NF1) cases are histologically benign tumors, but they can be fatal due to compression of vital structures or transformation to malignant sarcomas or malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors. All sizeable plexiform neurofibromas are thought to result from an early second mutation giving rise to a loss of heterozygosity of the <i>NF1</i> gene. In this unusual case, a 12-year-old girl presented with a rapidly growing, extremely extensive plexiform neurofibroma with segmental distribution over the entire right arm, extending to the right chest wall and mediastinum, superimposed on classic cutaneous lesions of NF1. After several surgical interventions, the patient was efficiently treated with an oral selective MEK inhibitor, selumetinib, which resulted in a rapid reduction of the tumor volume. Molecular analysis of the <i>NF1</i> gene revealed a c.2326-2 A>G splice-site mutation in the clinically unaffected skin, peripheral blood sample, and plexiform neurofibroma, which explains the general clinical symptoms. Furthermore, a novel likely pathogenic variant, c.4933dupC (p.Leu1645Profs*7), has been identified exclusively in the girl's plexiform neurofibromas. This second-hit mutation can explain the extremely extensive segmental involvement."

Our case report illustrates the progression of a non-union of the ulna after minor trauma in a twelve-year-old boy, newly diagnosed with NF1, and presents the technique of microsurgical bone reconstruction, including the growth plate. More than seven years after the first operation, follow-up presents a favorable outcome with a pain-free patient and unrestricted function of the forearm after a secondary correction of the remaining radial bowing. This treatment is discussed with a comprehensive review of the current literature on ulnar congenital pseudarthrosis in PubMed and Google Scholar and free fibular growth plate transfer in PubMed and Google Scholar. Nine publications reporting on 20 cases of congenital ulnar non-unions were identified. With this reconstructive option, favorable outcomes were achieved in all cases with the union after primary surgery and complications requiring further surgeries in nine cases. The benefit of vascularized growth plate bone transfer in congenital ulna non-union seems to be significant compared to other therapies such as open reduction internal fixation (ORIF), non-vascularized bone grafts, or one-bone-forearms and beneficial when growth reconstruction is needed. Other techniques might be necessary to improve insufficient long-term results."

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1) is caused by mutations in the NF1 gene that encodes neurofibromin, a negative regulator of RAS proto-oncogene. Approximately one-third of the reported pathogenic mutations in NF1 are splicing mutations, but most consequences are unclear. The objective of this study was to identify the pathogenicity of splicing mutation in a Chinese family with NF-1 and determine the effects of the pre-mRNA splicing mutation by in vitro functional analysis. Next-generation sequencing was used to screen candidate mutations. We performed a minigene splicing assay to determine the effect of the splicing mutation on NF1 expression, and three-dimensional structure models of neurofibromin were generated using SWISS-MODEL and PROCHECK methods, respectively. A pathogenic splicing mutation c.479+1G&gt;C in NF1 was found in the proband characterized by childhood-onset refractory hypertension. In vitro analysis demonstrated that c.479+1G&gt;C mutation caused the skipping of exon 4, leading to a glutamine-to-valine substitution at position 97 in neurofibromin and an open reading frame shift terminating at codon 108. Protein modeling showed that several major domains were missing in the truncated neurofibromin protein. The splicing mutation c.479+1G&gt;C identified in a Chinese patient with NF-1 and childhood-onset refractory hypertension caused the skipping of exon 4 and a truncated protein. Our findings offer new evidence for the molecular diagnosis of NF-1."

It is closely associated with a unique neurocutaneous stigmata under the spectrum of the dermatological manifestations of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Almost 81% of MPNST arises from a precursor neuroma, and multifocality of these lesions is extremely rare, making up to 0.001% of cases. Moreover, spinal cases are extremely uncommon with only four cases reported internationally. Here, we present the fifth and sixth spinal MPNST cases with a brief review of literature. We describe two unusual cases of multifocal MPNST in relation to NF1 occurring in the spinal cord. Both patients presented with local pain and myelopathic symptoms. The two patients underwent wide surgical resection, followed by neoadjuvant radiotherapy and reported immediate postoperative improvement of the presented complaint; however, one patient suffered from rapid recurrence and metastasis. Due to the scarcity of spinal cases related to MPNST, no clear guidelines regarding the management of these cases are set in the literature. Histopathological diagnosis remains as the most pivotal diagnostic tool as they can mimic other peripheral nerve sheath lesions, such as neuromas and schwannomas, in imaging. Cases that were managed by early surgical intervention in addition to neoadjuvant radiotherapy reported the best outcome. However, cases of MPNST in concomitance with NF1 were found to be resistant to both chemo and radiotherapy and have high recurrence rate."

After total tumor resection, the anatomopathological examination showed monophasic SS. The patient returned after 6 months with similar symptoms, and the lesion recurred and was reoperated. Unfortunately, 7 months after the second surgery, the patient died.

We assessed endocrine morbidity in individuals with NF1 from information on hospital admissions, surgery for endocrine disorders, and relevant medication. A nationwide population registry-based cohort study. We identified 2467 individuals with NF1 diagnosed between 1977 and 2013 from the Danish National Patient Register and the RAREDIS database and 20 132 randomly sampled age- and sex-matched population comparisons. Information on endocrine diseases was identified using registrations of discharge diagnoses, surgery, and medication prescriptions. The rates of endocrine disorders in individuals with NF1 were compared with those in the comparison cohort in Cox proportional hazard models. Individuals with NF1 had a higher rate than the comparison group of any endocrine discharge diagnosis (hazard ratio [HR] 1.72, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.58-1.87), endocrine-related surgery (2.03, 1.39-2.96), and prescribed medications (1.32, 1.23-1.42). Increased HRs were observed for diseases and surgical operations of several glands, including pheochromocytoma, and for osteoporosis, and osteoporotic fractures. Decreased rates were observed with drugs for type 2 diabetes. Women with NF1 had higher HRs for surgery of the ovaries, uterus, and sterilization, but lower rates of surgeries of cervix and prescriptions for birth control pills. Neurofibromatosis 1 is associated with a variety of endocrine disorders, surgery, and medication related to endocrine disease. Awareness of endocrine morbidity is important in the clinical follow-up of individuals with NF1."

A 67-year-old, female patient presented with a nodular lesion in the cervical esophagus which was detected on follow-up computed tomography (CT) after surgery for bilateral breast cancer and gastric cancer. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed a hemispheric, submucosal lesion in the cervicothoracic esophagus. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration cytology revealed spindle-shaped cells with nuclear atypia and positive staining for the S100 protein, a neurogenic marker. Based on clear CT findings of lesion growth over two years, MPNST was diagnosed, and treatment for sarcoma was begun. After one course of preoperative chemotherapy, open resection of the esophagus was performed, revealing a solid, white tumor with a maximum diameter of 1.8 cm. The tumor was histopathologically found to be located within the intrinsic muscularis propria. Based on this finding, low-grade MPNST with a schwannoma-like component at its margins was diagnosed. Approximately 50% of MPNST cases occur against a background of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) while about 40% occur sporadically, and 10% occur after irradiation.

FPNF often grows invasively and destructively, which may complicate surgical treatment. Data on the frequency, location, and surgical procedures of patients with NF1-associated FPNF are scarce. This study provides treatment data from a nationally networked reference center for the treatment of NF1 patients. The localization and treatment data of 179 NF1 patients with FPNF were analyzed. Photographically documented tumors of the study area, further determined by imaging, were manually transferred to a facial scheme and digitized. The digitized registrations of the facial extensions of the tumors of each patient were overlaid in a single image (Photoshop™), so that the file of the facial scheme contained the sum of the tumor localization. Finally, the frequency of tumor localization was indicated with a color code. The frequency of tumor extension-related coded colors was applied to outline the lesions' topography on schematic face drawings (heat map). The distribution of the tumors showed no side preference. The need for the treatment of patients with orbital/periorbital manifestations became evident in the graphic representations. Tumors do not respect anatomical units. However, the classification of the face according to dermatomes, especially the trigeminal nerve, offers indications of tumor spread and guides treatment planning. The mean number of surgical measures per patient was 2.21 (median: 1). Extensive swelling, hematoma, and delayed wound healing were all common postoperative complications. The color-coded, schematic overview of the frequency distribution of cutaneous tumor spread in NF1 patients with FPNF illustrates the importance of orbital/periorbital and cheek tumor manifestations in patients' treatment needs. The imaging procedure is suitable for controlling natural tumor growth in the same way as the documentation of the post-surgical course. Repeated interventions in the region are included in surgical planning of the progressing tumor disease."

Twenty percent of NF1 patients harbor nonsense mutations resulting in premature termination codons (PTCs). Nonsense suppression therapies can facilitate ribosomal readthrough of PTCs to restore full-length protein, but their potential in NF1 is underexplored. We developed a minipig model of NF1 carrying a PTC to test whether nonsense suppression could restore expression of the <i>NF1</i>-encoded protein neurofibromin <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. Nonsense suppression did not reliably increase neurofibromin in primary <i>NF1</i><sup><i>-/-</i></sup> Schwann cells isolated from minipig neurofibromas but could reduce phosphorylated ERK. Gentamicin <i>in vivo</i> produced a similar plasma pharmacokinetic profile to humans and was detectable in clinically relevant tissues, including cerebral cortex, sciatic nerve, optic nerve, and skin. In gentamicin-treated animals, increased neurofibromin expression was seen in the optic nerve. Nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) causes degradation of transcripts with PTCs, which could impede nonsense suppression therapies. Nonsense suppression in combination with NMD inhibition restored neurofibromin protein expression in primary <i>NF1</i><sup><i>-/-</i></sup> Schwann cells isolated from minipig neurofibromas. Thus, the effectiveness of nonsense suppression therapies can be improved in NF1 by the concurrent use of NMD inhibitors."

Although the <i>Nf1</i> gene has been identified as a potential causative gene, its role in congenital heart disease has not been thoroughly clarified. We searched and summarized evidence from cohort-based and experimental studies on the issue of <i>Nf1</i> and heart development in congenital heart diseases from various databases. Available evidence demonstrates a correlation between <i>Nf1</i> and congenital heart diseases, mainly pulmonary valvar stenosis. The mechanism underlying this correlation may involve dysregulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The <i>Nf1</i> gene affects the EMT process via multiple pathways, including directly regulating the expression of EMT-related transcription factors and indirectly regulating the EMT process by regulating the MAPK pathway. This narrative review provides a comprehensive account of the <i>Nf1</i> involvement in heart development and congenital cardiovascular diseases in terms of epidemiology and potential mechanisms. RAS signaling may contribute to congenital heart disease independently or in cooperation with other signaling pathways. Efficient management of both NF1 and cardiovascular disease patients would benefit from further research into these issues."

    "abstract": "Despite the evidence of elevated autistic behaviors and co-occurring neurodevelopmental difficulties in many children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), we have a limited understanding of the sensory processing challenges that may occur with the condition. This study examined the sensory profile of children and adolescents with NF1 and investigated the relationships between the sensory profiles and patient characteristics and neuropsychological functioning. The parent/caregivers of 152 children with NF1 and 96 typically developing children completed the Sensory Profile 2 (SP2), along with standardized questionnaires assessing autistic behaviors, ADHD symptoms, internalizing symptoms, adaptive functioning, and social skills. Intellectual functioning was also assessed. The SP2 data indicated elevated sensory processing problems in children with NF1 compared to typically developing children. Over 40% of children with NF1 displayed differences in sensory registration (missing sensory input) and were unusually sensitive to and unusually avoidant of sensory stimuli. Sixty percent of children with NF1 displayed difficulties in one or more sensory modalities. Elevated autistic behaviors and ADHD symptoms were associated with more severe sensory processing difficulties. This first detailed assessment of sensory processing, alongside other clinical features, in a relatively large cohort of children and adolescents with NF1 demonstrates the relationships between sensory processing differences and adaptive skills and behavior, as well as psychological well-being. Our characterization of the sensory profile within a genetic syndrome may help facilitate more targeted interventions to support overall functioning."

    "abstract": "Although significant progress has been made in improving the rate of survival for pediatric optic pathway gliomas (OPGs), data describing the methods of diagnosis and treatment for OPGs are limited in the modern era. This retrospective study aims to provide an epidemiological overview in the pediatric population and an update on eye care resource utilization in OPG patients using big data analysis. Using the OptumLabs Data Warehouse, 9-11 million children from 2016 to 2021 assessed the presence of an OPG claim. This data set was analyzed for demographic distribution data and clinical data including average ages for computed tomography (CT), MRI, strabismus, and related treatment (surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation), as well as yearly rates for optical coherence tomography (OCT) and visual field (VF) examinations. Five hundred fifty-one unique patients ranging in age from 0 to 17 years had an OPG claim, with an estimated prevalence of 4.6-6.1 per 100k. Among the 476 OPG patients with at least 6 months of follow-up, 88.9% had at least one MRI and 15.3% had at least one CT. Annual rates for OCT and VF testing were similar (1.26 vs 1.35 per year), although OCT was ordered for younger patients (mean age = 9.2 vs 11.7 years, respectively). During the study period, 14.1% of OPG patients had chemotherapy, 6.1% had either surgery or radiation, and 81.7% had no treatment. This study updates OPG demographics for the modern era and characterizes the burden of the treatment course for pediatric OPG patients using big data analysis of a commercial claims database. OPGs had a prevalence of about 0.005% occurring equally in boys and girls. Most did not receive treatment, and the average child had at least one claim for OCT or VF per year for clinical monitoring. This study is limited to only commercially insured children, who represent approximately half of the general child population."

    "abstract": "Children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) are at increased risk of developing cognitive problems, including attention deficits and learning difficulties. Alterations in brain response to repetition and change have been evidenced in other genetic conditions associated with cognitive dysfunctions. Whether the integrity of these fundamental neural responses is compromised in school-aged children with NF1 is still unknown. In this study, we examined the repetition suppression (RS) and change detection responses in children with NF1 (n = 36) and neurotypical controls (n = 41) aged from 4 to 13 years old, using a simple sequence of vowels. We performed time-frequency analyses to compare spectral power and phase synchronization between groups, in the theta, alpha and beta frequency bands. Correlational analyses were performed between the neural responses and the level of intellectual functioning, as well as with behavioral symptoms of comorbid neurodevelopmental disorders measured through parental questionnaires. Children with NF1 showed preserved RS, but increased spectral power in the change detection response. Correlational analyses performed with measures of change detection revealed a negative association between the alpha-band spectral power and symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity. These findings suggest atypical neural response to change in children with NF1. Further studies should be conducted to clarify the interaction with comorbid neurodevelopmental disorders and the possible role of altered inhibitory mechanisms in this enhanced neural response."

A better understanding of the association between neurocutaneous syndromes, perinatal factors, and childhood cancer is key for earlier cancer detection. To evaluate the association of neurocutaneous syndromes and perinatal factors with childhood cancer risk in a cohort of Swedish children. In this nationwide cohort study, all children and adolescents up to age 20 years, from 1973 to 2015, were identified through the Swedish National Medical Birth Register (MBR), provided they had information on both biological parents. Analyses were conducted from April 2021 through May 2023. Diagnoses of neurocutaneous syndromes were obtained from the MBR, National Patient Register, and Cause of Death register. Perinatal factors (birth weight, gestational age, birth weight by gestational age, 5-minute Apgar score, and head circumference) were obtained from the MBR. Childhood cancer risk (<20 years at diagnosis; identified from the National Cancer Register), including leukemia, lymphoma, and central nervous system (CNS) tumors. Among 4 173 108 included children (2 143 133 [51.4%] male, median [IQR] follow-up 20 [9.7-20] years), 1783 had neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), 444 tuberous sclerosis, 63 von Hippel-Lindau disease, and 39 ataxia-telangiectasia. An increased cancer risk was observed among children with any neurocutaneous syndrome (HR, 34.9; 95% CI, 30.8-39.6) and was particularly pronounced for CNS tumors (HR, 111.7; 95% CI, 96.8-128.8), except among children with ataxia-telangiectasia, where the increased risk was associated with lymphomas (HR, 233.1; 95% CI, 75.0-724.1). Leukemia risk was increased only among children with NF1 (HR, 4.1; 95% CI, 1.7-9.8). Several perinatal factors, including high birth weight, being born large for gestational age, preterm birth, low 5-minute Apgar score, and large head circumference had lesser associations with childhood cancer. Adjusting for neurocutaneous syndromes did not affect these associations. In this nationwide cohort study, neurocutaneous syndromes were associated with an increased risk of childhood cancer, especially CNS tumors. Several perinatal factors had lesser associations with childhood cancer, independently of the presence of neurocutaneous syndromes. Other biological mechanisms likely underlie the association between perinatal factors and childhood cancer."

    "abstract": "Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are aggressive soft-tissue sarcomas characterized by poor prognosis and low drug response rates. Traditional chemo/radiotherapies show only mild benefits for patients with MPNSTs, and no targeted therapy is available in the clinic. A better understanding of the molecular background of MPNSTs is critical for the development of effective targeted therapies. Forkhead box M1 (FOXM1) has been implicated in the progression of many human malignancies, though its role in MPNSTs is unclear. In this study, using four Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets and a tissue microarray, we demonstrated that FOXM1 upregulation was associated with poor prognosis in patients with MPNSTs. FOXM1 overexpression and knockdown regulated the proliferation and colony formation of MPNST cells. Using bioinformatics analysis and luciferase reporter assays, we identified NUF2 as a direct downstream target of FOXM1. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that the induction of MPNST cell proliferation by FOXM1 was dependent on elevated NUF2 expression, as NUF2 knockdown abolished the FOXM1-induced proliferation of MPNST cells. Our study showed that the FOXM1-NUF2 axis mediates human MPNST progression and could be a potential therapeutic target."

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1) has a remarkable association with a spectrum of arterial diseases, including an occlusive or aneurismal disease. Less often it affects celiac arteries. Here we present a case of rupture of celiac artery aneurysm in a patient NF-1 who presented with sudden onset of acute severe epigastric pain with tenderness and guarding in the epigastric region. Computed tomography (CT) scan revealed celiac artery aneurysm with evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma. As the patient became unstable, we performed emergency laparotomy in the best interest of the patient in our setting, and we barely controlled the source of bleeding. Unfortunately, we could not save the patient as he developed disseminated intravascular coagulation due to a massive blood transfusion. Visceral artery aneurysm should be considered in patients present with an acute abdomen with anemia. As neurofibromatosis is associated with a spectrum of a vascular disease, vascular screening needs to be considered. Even though celiac artery aneurysm is rare, it should be considered as one of the prompt differential diagnoses when patients present with an acute abdomen with anemia to prevent a fatal outcome."

Recently revised diagnostic criteria include the addition of genetic testing to confirm a pathogenic variant, as well as to detect the presence of mosaicism. Therefore, the use and interpretation of both germline and tumor-based testing have increasing importance in the diagnostic approach, treatment decisions, and risk stratification of these conditions. This focused review discusses approaches to genetic testing of NF- and SWN-related tumor types, which are somewhat rare and perhaps lesser known to non-specialized clinicians. These include gastrointestinal stromal tumors, breast cancer, plexiform neurofibromas with or without transformation to malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, gliomas, and schwannomas, and emphasizes the need for inclusion of genetic providers in patient care and appropriate pre- and post-test education, genetic counseling, and focused evaluation by a medical geneticist or other healthcare provider familiar with clinical manifestations of these disorders."

This disease involves different organ systems and presents with a variety of clinical manifestations, such as schwannoma, depigmentation, low-grade glioma, and skeletal abnormalities. We report a case of type I neurofibromatosis with an occipital bone defect. We report a case of a 50-year-old man with type I neurofibromatosis with occipital bone defect. The patient was accepted by the local hospital due to sudden right upper limb weakness accompanied by jitter without recognizable cause or inducement. A computerized tomography scan at a local hospital suggested subcutaneous neurofibromatosis with a left occipital cranial defect with thinning bone. On admission physical examination, diffuse multiple masses could be seen throughout the body and head of different sizes and composed of soft and tough textures. The largest one was located in the posterior occipital bone, approximately 8*8 cm in size, with a child tumor and tough texture. Multiple café-au-lait spots could be found on the chest and back, and multiple freckles can be seen in the armpit. The patient underwent surgery. Postoperative pathology showed a spindle cell tumor, which was determined to be neurofibromatosis type I according to immunopathology and clinical data. The patient was admitted for surgical treatment. During the operation, the scalp mass was completely abducted and the tumor tissue at the skull defect was sharply separated. Postoperative pathology showed that the peripheral margin and the bottom margin were cleaned. Computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging showed that the tumor was completely. There were not any surgical complications. The patient recovered well, was cured and was dismissed from the hospital. The synergistic effect between nonmalignant lesions can also cause a serious impact on patient survival to encourage early medical intervention. The clinical presentation of neurofibromatosis type I am usually nonmalignant, and in this case, involvement of the skull with bone defect is very rare. Therefore, it is necessary to accumulate relevant cases, reveal the pathogenesis of the disease, predict the development and outcome, and provide more evidence for early therapeutic intervention of similar patients in the future."

    "abstract": "Optic pathway glioma (OPG) occurs in as many as one-fifth of individuals with the neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) cancer predisposition syndrome. Generally considered low-grade and slow growing, many children with NF1-OPGs remain asymptomatic. However, due to their location within the optic pathway, ~20-30% of those harboring NF1-OPGs will experience symptoms, including progressive vision loss, proptosis, diplopia, and precocious puberty. While treatment with conventional chemotherapy is largely effective at attenuating tumor growth, it is not clear whether there is much long-term recovery of visual function. Additionally, because these tumors predominantly affect young children, there are unique challenges to NF1-OPG diagnosis, monitoring, and longitudinal management. Over the past two decades, the employment of authenticated genetically engineered <i>Nf1</i>-OPG mouse models have provided key insights into the function of the <i>NF1</i> protein, neurofibromin, as well as the molecular and cellular pathways that contribute to optic gliomagenesis. Findings from these studies have resulted in the identification of new molecular targets whose inhibition blocks murine <i>Nf1</i>-OPG growth in preclinical studies. Some of these promising compounds have now entered into early clinical trials. Future research focused on defining the determinants that underlie optic glioma initiation, expansion, and tumor-induced optic nerve injury will pave the way to personalized risk assessment strategies, improved tumor monitoring, and optimized treatment plans for children with NF1-OPG."

We now examined the labor market participation of individuals with NF1. We analyzed the numbers of days of work, unemployment, and sickness allowance among 742 Finnish individuals with NF1 aged 20-59 years using nationwide register data from Statistics Finland and the Social Insurance Institution of Finland. The individuals with NF1 were compared with a control cohort of 8716 individuals matched with age, sex, and the area of residence. Individuals with NF1 had a significantly lower number of working days per year than the controls (rate ratio [RR] 0.93, 95% CI 0.91-0.95). Unemployment (RR 1.79, 95% CI 1.58-2.02), and sickness absence (RR 1.44, 95% CI 1.25-1.67) were more frequent in the NF1 than in the control group. The causes of sickness allowances were highly concordant with the previously reported morbidity profile of NF1 including neoplasms, cardiovascular disease, mental and behavioral diseases, and neurological diseases. In conclusion, NF1 significantly interferes with labor market participation via both unemployment and morbidity. Unemployment seems to cause more days of not working than sickness absence."

Our objective is to demonstrate PAMM development following uncomplicated cataract surgery, possibly triggered by fasting and dehydration. We also aim to emphasize the potential role of hyperbaric oxygen therapy in treating PAMM. A 66-year-old man with a past medical history of Neurofibromatosis type 1 and cardiovascular disease underwent uncomplicated cataract surgery in the left eye. The patient was also fasting due to Ramadan. The patient complained of very low vision during the routine postoperative examination on the third day. His-best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was counting fingers at 1 meter. His-anterior and posterior segment examination was unremarkable. In infrared imaging, a large hyporeflective area was observed in the parafoveal region, and structural OCT also showed increased hyperreflectivity in the middle retinal layers corresponding to the junction of INL and outer plexiform layer (OPL) involving the entire INL which suggested PAMM. Following 14 sessions of hyperbaric oxygen therapy, the patient's BCVA increased to 0.9 on the 14th day of diagnosing PAMM. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case representing a patient with PAMM triggered by fasting and cataract surgery who responded positively to hyperbaric oxygen therapy. However, triggering of PAMM by fasting is entirely unproven and that this observation occurred in a highly complex case with many other possible contributing factors. Also, the triggering of PAMM by some manipulation during surgery is equally unproven."

Formerly grouped under the term Phacomatosis because lesions of the eye were frequently encountered or genodermatosis when typical skin lesions were present, these terms have been progressively discarded. Although originally reported centuries ago, they still represent a challenge for their complexity of cure. Nowadays, with the introduction of advanced genetics and the consequent opportunity of whole-genome sequencing, new single cancer susceptibility genes have been identified or better characterized; although there is evidence that the predisposition to a few specific tumor syndromes should be accounted to a group of mutations in different genes while certain syndromes appeared to be manifestations of different mutations in the same gene adding supplementary problems in their characterization and establishing the diagnosis. Noteworthy, many syndromes have been genetically determined and well-characterized, accordingly in the near future, we expect that new targeted therapies will be available for the definitive cure of these syndromes and other gliomas (Pour-Rashidi et al. in World Neurosurgery, 2021). The most common CNS syndromes that will be discussed in this chapter include neurofibromatosis (NF) types 1 and 2, von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease, and tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), as well as syndromes having mostly extra-neural manifestations such as Cowden, Li-Fraumeni, Turcot, and Gorlin syndromes."

    "title": "Other Nerve Sheath Tumors of Brain and Spinal Cord.",
    "abstract": "The three main types of nerve sheath tumors are schwannomas, neurofibromas and perineuriomas. Multiple neurofibromas throughout the body are the hallmark of Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Spinal nerve sheath tumors are classified in the group of intradural extramedullary spinal cord tumors, in which they are the most common type (25-30%). Their incidence is 3-4 per 1 million people. Spinal schwannomas are encountered sporadically or in the context of Neurofibromatosis type 2, while neurofibromas are typical for patients with Neurofibromatosis type 1. Neurofibromas are composed predominantly of Schwann cells and fibroblasts, alongside which are also found axons, perineurial cells, mast cells and extracellular matrix. Most of the neurofibromas are asymptomatic. Any increase in the size of a neurofibroma or the presence of pain is an indicator of a possible malignant degeneration. Neurofibromas are treated surgically. Neurofibromas involve the whole nerve and cause its fusiform enlargement which makes it impossible to preserve the nerve's functions if complete tumor removal is performed. Hence, such tumors are initially observed. In case of progressive growth, the options are either resection of the tumor and immediate reconstruction with a peripheral nerve graft (e.g., nerve suralis interposition graft) or subtotal removal and follow-up. Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) are very rare tumors with incidence of around 1 per 1,000,000 people. MPNST account for 3-10% of all soft-tissue sarcomas. The most common initial symptom of MPNST is a painless mass. Any rapid increase in a subcutaneous mass or rapid onset of symptoms should raise the suspicion of a malignant tumor. In patients with diagnosed NF1, the recent rapid increase in a known lesion should raise the suspicion of malignant degeneration of the lesion and opt for active treatment. In the case of MPNST a wide surgical excision is advocated. The resectability depends greatly on the location of the tumors and varies from around 20% in paraspinal MPNST and reaches 95% in MPNST localized in the extremities. MPNST are a rare disease and should be managed by a multidisciplinary team of neurosurgeons, radiologists and oncologists."

Recurrent gingival neurofibromas have been rarely reported in the periodontal literature, particularly affecting elderly patients. A 70-year-old man with a pale, rubbery, and painless thickening along the facial/buccal gingiva of the mandibular right canine and first premolar. Ten years prior, the patient had undergone excision of a neurofibroma within the same region. The patient denied a history of cutaneous disease or neurofibromatosis. Histopathologic and immunostaining of the excised lesion confirmed the diagnosis as a recurrent gingival neurofibroma. With cases of suspected recurrent neurofibroma, attending practitioners should consult with an oral pathologist whether the primary lesion had exhibited tumor cells to the surgical specimen margin. Preoperative use of a cone beam computed tomography scan may enhance determination of tumor depth. Clinicians should also carefully weigh the decision for conservative excision of gingival neurofibromas and greater risk of recurrence versus performing a somewhat wider extirpation and possible formation of a mucogingival defect. What are important clinical considerations when performing a gingival biopsy? Gingival neurofibromas may be associated with an increased risk for recurrence owing to decisions for tissue-sparing excision and prevention of a mucogingival defect; supplemental use of cone beam computed tomographic scans may provide greater appreciation of tumor depth. What is a reasonable length of time of postoperative assessment for gingival neurofibromas? Patients who have undergone surgical removal of a gingival neurofibroma should undergo yearly surveillance for at least 10 years. What is a key limitation to this case study? Preoperatively, attending clinicians should consult with an oral pathologist to ascertain whether a primary lesion had manifested tumor cells to the surgical margin. Conservative gingival resection of a neurofibroma may promote recurrence."

Currently, the pathogenesis of bone disorders in NF1 patients is unclear, and there are no effective preventive and treatment measures. In this study, we found that knockout of the NF1 gene reduced cAMP levels and osteogenic differentiation in an osteoblast model, and icariin activated the cAMP/PKA/CREB pathway to promote osteoblast differentiation of the NF1 gene knockout cell model by increasing intracellular cAMP levels. The PKA selective inhibitor H89 significantly impaired the stimulatory effect of icariin on osteogenesis in the NF1 cell model. In this study, an osteoblast model of NF1 was successfully constructed, and icariin was applied to the cell model for the first time. The results will help to elucidate the molecular mechanism of NF1 bone disease and provide new ideas for the clinical prevention and treatment of NF1 bone disease and drug development in the future."

While germline variants are pathogenic, it is not known whether those that arise in cancer (somatic variants) are passenger or driver variants. To address this question, we sought to define the landscape of <i>NF1</i> variants in sporadic cancers. <i>NF1</i> variants in sporadic cancers were compiled using data curated on the c-Bio database and compared with published germline variants and Genome Aggregation Database data. Pathogenicity was determined using Polyphen and Sorting Intolerant From Tolerant prediction tools. The spectrum of <i>NF1</i> variants in sporadic tumors differ from those most commonly seen in individuals with NF1. In addition, the type and location of the variants in sporadic cancer differ from germline variants, where a high proportion of missense variants were found. Finally, many of the sporadic cancer <i>NF1</i> variants were not predicted to be pathogenic. Taken together, these findings suggest that a significant proportion of <i>NF1</i> variants in sporadic cancer may be passenger variants or hypomorphic alleles. Further mechanistic studies are warranted to define their unique roles in nonsyndromic cancer pathobiology."

A self-expandable covered stent was placed, and a completion angiogram demonstrated good aneurysm sealing and contrast flow to the left kidney. The patient's blood pressure improved after the procedure. Her medications were lowered to almost half of their baseline doses, and hydralazine was discontinued. On the follow-up visit after 4 months, the patient reported his home-measured systolic blood pressure to be less than 120 mm Hg. A repeated CTA of the abdomen showed post-left RAA repair with a covered stent and interval improvement of the left kidney. RAA caused by NF-1 are manageable and feasible with endovascular intervention."

    "title": "Prevalence of Endocrine Manifestations and GIST in 108 Systematically Screened Patients With Neurofibromatosis Type 1.",
    "abstract": "In patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), guidelines suggest screening for pheochromocytoma by metanephrine measurement and abdominal imaging, which may lead to the discovery of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs) and their differential diagnosis, gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs). Other endocrine manifestations such as follicular thyroid carcinoma and primary hyperparathyroidism have also been reported in a few cases. This study aimed to describe prevalence and clinical presentation of these manifestations through systematic screening in a large cohort of patients. In this monocentric retrospective study, 108 patients with NF1 were included and screened for endocrine manifestations and GISTs. Clinical, laboratory, molecular profile, pathology, and morphologic (abdominal computed tomography scan and/or magnetic resonance imaging) and functional imaging were collected. Twenty-four patients (22.2% of the cohort, 16 female, mean age 42.6 years) presented with pheochromocytomas that were unilateral in 65.5%, benign in 89.7%, and with a ganglioneural component in 20.7%. Three female patients (2.8% of the cohort, aged 42-63 years) presented with well-differentiated GEP-NETs, and 4 (3.7%) with GISTs. One patient had primary hyperparathyroidism, 1 patient had medullary microcarcinoma, and 16 patients had goiter, multinodular in 10 cases. There was no correlation between pheochromocytoma and other NF1 tumoral manifestations, nor correlations between pheochromocytoma and <i>NF1</i> genotype, despite a familial clustering in one-third of patients. The pheochromocytoma prevalence in this NF1 cohort was higher (>20%) than previously described, confirming the interest of systematic screening, especially in young women. The prevalence of GEP-NETs and GISTs was about 3%, respectively. No phenotype-genotype correlation was observed."

    "title": "Combined CDK4/6 and ERK1/2 Inhibition Enhances Antitumor Activity in NF1-Associated Plexiform Neurofibroma.",
    "abstract": "Plexiform neurofibromas (PNF) are peripheral nerve sheath tumors that cause significant morbidity in persons with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), yet treatment options remain limited. To identify novel therapeutic targets for PNF, we applied an integrated multi-omic approach to quantitatively profile kinome enrichment in a mouse model that has predicted therapeutic responses in clinical trials for NF1-associated PNF with high fidelity. Utilizing RNA sequencing combined with chemical proteomic profiling of the functionally enriched kinome using multiplexed inhibitor beads coupled with mass spectrometry, we identified molecular signatures predictive of response to CDK4/6 and RAS/MAPK pathway inhibition in PNF. Informed by these results, we evaluated the efficacy of the CDK4/6 inhibitor, abemaciclib, and the ERK1/2 inhibitor, LY3214996, alone and in combination in reducing PNF tumor burden in Nf1flox/flox;PostnCre mice. Converging signatures of CDK4/6 and RAS/MAPK pathway activation were identified within the transcriptome and kinome that were conserved in both murine and human PNF. We observed robust additivity of the CDK4/6 inhibitor, abemaciclib, in combination with the ERK1/2 inhibitor, LY3214996, in murine and human NF1(Nf1) mutant Schwann cells. Consistent with these findings, the combination of abemaciclib (CDK4/6i) and LY3214996 (ERK1/2i) synergized to suppress molecular signatures of MAPK activation and exhibited enhanced antitumor activity in Nf1flox/flox;PostnCre mice in vivo. These findings provide rationale for the clinical translation of CDK4/6 inhibitors alone and in combination with therapies targeting the RAS/MAPK pathway for the treatment of PNF and other peripheral nerve sheath tumors in persons with NF1."

    "title": "Clinical signs and genetic evaluation of patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 with and without optic pathway gliomas in a center in Turkey.",
    "abstract": "Optic pathway gliomas (OPGs) occur in 15% of patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Their location renders biopsy or surgical resection difficult because of the risk of vision loss. Therefore, only a few NF1-OPGs have been used for tissue diagnosis, and only a few analyses have been published on the molecular changes that drive tumorigenesis. Due to this reason, we evaluated 305 NF1 patients, 34 with OPG and 271 without OPG for germ line mutations. All subjects underwent clinical examination and DNA analysis of NF1, confirming the diagnosis of NF1. Clinically, the group with OPG had a significantly higher incidence of bone dysplasia (P < 0.001) and more café-au-lait spots (P = 0.001) compared to those in the group without OPG. The frequency of Lisch nodules was on the borderline of statistical significance (P = 0.058), whereas the frequency of neurofibromas did not differ significantly (cutaneous, P = 0.64; plexiform, P = 0.44). Individuals with OPG mostly had mutations in the first one-third of the NF1 gene compared with that in patients who did not have OPG. Some identical mutations were detected in unrelated families with NF1-OPG. The observation of certain phenotypic features and the correlation between genotype and phenotype might help to determine the risk of developing OPG with NF1."

    "title": "Neurofibromatosis type 1-associated optic pathway gliomas: pathogenesis and emerging treatments.",
    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder associated with an increased risk of developing a variety of benign and malignant tumors. Fifteen to 20% of children with NF1 are diagnosed with an optic pathway glioma (NF1-OPG) before 7 years of age, and more than half of them experience visual decline. At present, no effective therapy is available for prevention, restoration, or even stabilization of vision loss in subjects affected by NF1-OPG. This paper aims to review the main emerging pharmacological approaches that have been recently assessed in preclinical and clinical settings. We performed a search of the literature using Embase, PubMed, and Scopus databases to identify articles regarding NF1-OPGs and their treatment up to July 1st, 2022. The reference lists of the analyzed articles were also considered a source of literature information. To search and analyze all relevant English articles, the following keywords were used in various combinations: neurofibromatosis type 1, optic pathway glioma, chemotherapy, precision medicine, MEK inhibitors, VEGF, nerve growth factor. Over the past decade, basic research and the development of genetically engineered mice models of NF1-associated OPG have shed light on the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the disease and inspired animal and human testing of several compounds. A promising line of research is focusing on the inhibition of mTOR, a protein kinase controlling proliferation, protein synthesis rate and cell motility that is highly expressed in neoplastic cells. Several mTOR blockers have been tested in clinical trials, the most recent of which employed oral everolimus with encouraging results. A different strategy aims at restoring cAMP levels in neoplastic astrocytes and non-neoplastic neurons, since reduced intracellular cAMP levels contribute to OPG growth and, more importantly, are the major determinant of NF1-OPG-associated visual decline. So far, however, this approach has only been attempted in preclinical studies. Stroma-directed molecular therapies - seeking to target Nf1 heterozygous brain microglia and retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) - are another fascinating field. Microglia-inhibiting strategies have not yet reached clinical trials, but preclinical studies conducted over the last 15 years have provided convincing clues of their potential. The importance of NF1-mutant RGCs in the formation and progression of OPGs also holds promise for clinical translation. The evidence of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF)- Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGFR) signaling hyperactivity in pediatric low-grade gliomas prompted the use of bevacizumab, an anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody, which was tested in children with low-grade gliomas or OPGs with good clinical results. Neuroprotective agents have also been proposed to preserve and restore RGCs and topical eye administration of nerve growth factor (NGF) has demonstrated encouraging electrophysiological and clinical results in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Traditional chemotherapy in patients with NF1-OPGs does not significantly ameliorate visual function, and its effectiveness in halting tumor growth cannot be considered a satisfactory result. Newer lines of research should be pursued with the goal of stabilizing or improving the vision, rather than reducing tumor volume. The growing understanding of the unique cellular and molecular characteristics of NF1-OPG, coupled with the recent publication of promising clinical studies, raise hope for a shift towards precision medicine and targeted therapies as a first-line treatment."

    "abstract": "Surgery is a common treatment strategy for patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)-related plexiform neurofibroma (PN) and has limited efficacy. FCN-159 is a novel anti-tumorigenic drug via selective inhibition of MEK1/2. This study assesses the safety and efficacy of FCN-159 in patients with NF1-related PN. This is a multicenter, open-label, single-arm, phase I dose-escalation study. Patients with NF1-related PN that was non-resectable or unsuitable for surgery were enrolled; they received FCN-159 monotherapy daily in 28-day cycles. Nineteen adults were enrolled in the study, 3 in 4 mg, 4 in 6 mg, 8 in 8 mg, and 4 in 12 mg. Among patients included in dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) analysis, DLTs (grade 3 folliculitis) were reported in 1 of 8 patients (16.7%) receiving 8 mg and 3 of 3 (100%) patients receiving 12 mg. The maximum tolerated dose was determined to be 8 mg. FCN-159-related treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were observed in 19 patients (100%); most of which were grade 1 or 2. Nine (47.4%) patients reported grade 3 study-drug-related TEAEs across all dose levels, including four experiencing paronychia and five experiencing folliculitis. Of the 16 patients analyzed, all (100%) had reduced tumor size and six (37.5%) achieved partial responses; the largest reduction in tumor size was 84.2%. The pharmacokinetic profile was approximately linear between 4 and 12 mg, and the half-life supported once daily dosing. FCN-159 was well tolerated up to 8 mg daily with manageable adverse events and showed promising anti-tumorigenic activity in patients with NF1-related PN, warranting further investigation in this indication.

We present a rare case of a young patient with neurofibromatosis and multidirectional knee instability who underwent a successful complex primary knee replacement surgery. Stress right knee radiographs showed global joint instability with permanent anterior knee dislocation, excessively hypoplastic femoral condyles and patella, joint surfaces incongruency, and hypoplastic varus tibia, with intraluminal midshaft bone bridge causing severe stenosis. The patient could not walk, had an unstable recurvatum right knee, and used a wheelchair for her professional activities. The surgery involved a fully cemented rotating-hinged total knee arthroplasty with tibial and femoral stems. After three years of follow-up, the patient remains pain-free, fully ambulatory with no walking aids, a stable knee, a full range of motion, and no signs of aseptic loosening. This case highlights the decision-making difficulties and the significant surgical challenges faced during the operation."

Of the six patients, two had previously undergone embolization. However, as a result, all patients received open surgery to remove hematomas. The hemostatic methods mentioned were vascular ligation (five patients), hypotensive anesthesia (two patients), and postoperative blood transfusion (four patients). In conclusion, spontaneous or minimally traumatic bleeding is possible in neurofibromatosis patients. In most cases, it can be resolved by vascular ligation under hypotensive anesthesia.

Nonliteral language (NLL) comprehension has not been examined in children with NF1. This study examined NLL comprehension in children with NF1 and associated neuropsychological correlates. NLL comprehension was examined in children with NF1 (<i>n</i> = 49) and typically developing (TD) controls (<i>n</i> = 27) aged 4-12 years using a novel NLL task. The task assessed comprehension of sarcasm, metaphor, simile, and literal language. Cognitive (Wechsler Scales Composites or the Woodcock-Johnson Test of Cognitive Abilities Revised scaled scores) and behavioral (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder [ADHD] symptoms) correlates of NLL comprehension in children with NF1 were also examined. Children with NF1 demonstrated significantly poorer sarcasm comprehension than TD children and a vulnerability in metaphor comprehension. Simile and literal language comprehension were not significantly different between groups. Working memory difficulties and impulsive/hyperactive ADHD symptoms were associated with a reduced ability to identify sarcasm in NF1, while verbal comprehension, fluid reasoning, and inattentive ADHD symptoms were not. Results suggest children with NF1 experience challenges in understanding complex NLL comprehension, which are related to reduced working memory and increased impulsivity/hyperactivity. This study provides an initial insight into the figurative language abilities of children with NF1, which should be examined in relation to their social difficulties in future studies.

    "title": "A new era for myelin research in Neurofibromatosis type 1.",
    "abstract": "Evidence for myelin regulating higher-order brain function and disease is rapidly accumulating; however, defining cellular/molecular mechanisms remains challenging partially due to the dynamic brain physiology involving deep changes during development, aging, and in response to learning and disease. Furthermore, as the etiology of most neurological conditions remains obscure, most research models focus on mimicking symptoms, which limits understanding of their molecular onset and progression. Studying diseases caused by single gene mutations represents an opportunity to understand brain dys/function, including those regulated by myelin. Here, we discuss known and potential repercussions of abnormal central myelin on the neuropathophysiology of Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1). Most patients with this monogenic disease present with neurological symptoms diverse in kind, severity, and onset/decline, including learning disabilities, autism spectrum disorders, attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder, motor coordination issues, and increased risk for depression and dementia. Coincidentally, most NF1 patients show diverse white matter/myelin abnormalities. Although myelin-behavior links were proposed decades ago, no solid data can prove or refute this idea yet. A recent upsurge in myelin biology understanding and research/therapeutic tools provides opportunities to address this debate. As precision medicine moves forward, an integrative understanding of all cell types disrupted in neurological conditions becomes a priority. Hence, this review aims to serve as a bridge between fundamental cellular/molecular myelin biology and clinical research in NF1."

Endocrine diseases and neoplasms also occur in patients with NF-1 and can include extrarenal paraganglioma, primary hyperparathyroidism, gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, thyroid tumors and other adrenal neoplasms. We demonstrate multiple neuroendocrine neoplasia (MEN 2A) of neurofibromatosis type 1 combined with pheochromocytoma and primary hyperparathyroidism in a woman with a long history of palpitations, paroxysmal hypertension and osteoporosis. Biochemical analysis revealed severe hypercalcemia with elevated parathyroid hormone indicating primary hyperparathyroidism, as well as high fractionated normetanephrine and metanephrine in the urine as a sign of catecholamine-releasing pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma. Further scintigraphy revealed signs of solitary parathyroid adenoma causing primary hyperparathyroidism and right-sided pheochromocytoma. Clinical diagnosis of MEN-2 syndrome is based on combination of at least two major MEN-2-associated endocrine tumors.

A mixed methods study from a subset of data coming from a randomized clinical trial that occurred from January 2021 to August 2022 was undertaken. Two groups (iCC and iCC + CM) were exposed to the customized iCanCope mobile application in which engagement data were captured in real-time with daily check-ins for interference, sleep, mood, physical activity, energy levels, goal setting, and accessing article content (coping strategies).

A boy born at 37 weeks postmenstrual age with neurofibromatosis type 1 was noted to have a large plexiform neurofibroma with left-sided involvement of the cavernous sinus, internal carotid artery, orbit, and optic nerve. He was managed for left eye glaucoma with anti-hypertensive eye drops, and at 8 months of age, he was referred for retinal evaluation. Fluorescein angiography showed striking nonperfusion of the left retina with only a small area of perfused vessels in the posterior pole. A large frond of neovascularization extended anteriorly from the posterior pole. The right eye had a crescent of retinal nonperfusion in the far periphery but otherwise normal retinal vessels. This case demonstrates a severe form of retinal ischemia in the setting of a large neurofibroma because of neurofibromatosis type 1. We hypothesize that vascular compression from the tumor led to disruption of the neurovascular bundle with resultant severe nonperfusion, neovascularization, and retinal maldevelopment."

They can occur anywhere in the body, primarily as a solitary mass or as a component of neurofibromatosis. Only 1/4 of the intradural extramedullary spinal tumors are neurofibromas. While most of the neurofibromas are asymptomatic, the authors report a patient with symptomatic multiple neurofibromas of the scalp and trunk that lacked the salient features of neurofibromatosis-1. A 63-year-old male from Saptari, Nepal, with multiple insidious swellings in the scalp and trunk region, presented with complaints of weakness of the bilateral lower limb for 6-7 years resulting in difficulties in walking and bleeding from the most significant swelling that was in the occipital area. Masses were present all over the scalp, averaging about 4×4 cm, with active bleeding from the two swellings. The authors performed the neurological assessment and histopathological and radiological investigations. A confirmed diagnosis of neurofibroma was made with myelography revealing an intradural extramedullary spinal tumor. A laminectomy with total excision of the tumor was performed. Meningiomas and nerve sheath tumors (schwannomas and neurofibromas) can both develop in the intradural extramedullary spinal compartment. Contrast-enhanced MRI is the most sensitive and specific imaging modality to evaluate possible spinal column lesions.

The current study compared the impact that generalized anxiety and quality of life had on work readiness and potential barriers that individuals with NF1 had in gaining and maintaining employment during the COVID-19 pandemic to a sample of healthy individuals using a moderating mediation analysis. A total of 213 individuals (105 NF1; 108 Healthy individuals) were recruited to complete a cross-sectional study in which a series of work-related assessments were completed. Generalized anxiety had an indirect effect on work readiness, fully mediated by barriers, with higher anxiety associated with more barriers, in turn negatively correlating with work readiness; quality of life partially mediated the effect of barriers on work readiness and was negatively associated with the former and positively with the latter. Quality of life was a mediator of the relationship between perceived employment barriers and work readiness for the healthy individuals group only. The results imply that anxiety and quality of life are significant mediators and require consideration in terms of evaluation and facilitation of employment maintenance and acquisition."

Reduced variability of systolic and diastolic nocturnal blood pressure was observed in NF1 patients compared with several studies of normotensive individuals (p = 0.024). In NF1 patients, the blunted systolic nocturnal decline was significantly associated with the number of neurofibromas (p = 0.049) and the presence of a plexiform neurofibroma (p = 0.020). Most NF1 patients in this study showed a \"non-dipper\" pattern with a blunted nocturnal BP decline, which is considered an independent risk factor for cardiovascular events in normotensive and hypertensive individuals. Periodic monitoring of BP should be included in NF1 follow-up guidelines to diagnose masked hypertension or a non-dipper/riser pattern which would significantly increase the morbidity and mortality of NF1 patients to implement therapeutic strategies."

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1) is a dominant genetic disorder often accompanied by lesions of the neurovascular system. Patients with NF-1 are predisposed to unique vertebral artery fistula (AVF). We report on a rare case of multiple neurovascular abnormalities in a 47-year-old man with neurofibromatosis. He was admitted due to a sudden headache and was found to have suffered a subarachnoid hemorrhage from a left vertebral arteriovenous fistula. He underwent two endovascular procedures complicated by a delayed extraspinal mass 7 days after treatment. Angiography revealed a new vascular abnormality, and although we performed another embolization, it failed to respond to further embolization. Vascular abnormalities in patients with NF-1 can be complex. Endovascular intervention remains feasible for NF-1 related AVF, however, partial occlusion of the fistula should be avoided to limit and iatrogenic damage to the blood vessels."

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant tumor predisposition syndrome that increases one's risk for both benign and malignant tumors. NF1 affects every organ in the body, but the most distinctive symptoms that are often the most bothersome to patients are the cutaneous manifestations, which can be unsightly, cause pain or pruritus, and have limited therapeutic options. In an effort to increase awareness of lesser-known dermatologic associations and to promote multidisciplinary care, we conducted a narrative review to shed light on dermatologic associations of NF1 as well as emerging treatment options. Topics covered include cutaneous neurofibromas, plexiform neurofibromas, diffuse neurofibromas, distinct nodular lesions, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, glomus tumors, juvenile xanthogranulomas, skin cancer, and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma."

    "abstract": "Plexiform neurofibromas are the hallmark of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and significantly contribute to the overall burden of disease. While surgical excision has long been the only available therapy, the MEK inhibitor (MEKi) selumetinib has been approved as a non-surgical treatment option for these tumors in 2020 (USA) and 2021 (Europe), respectively. However, selumetinib will result in tumor shrinkage only after several months of therapy and might not prevent malignant transformation of a plexiform neurofibroma that occurs with a frequency of 10-15%. Here, we demonstrate that surgical excision might be the therapy of choice in some plexiform neurofibromas despite the availability of MEKi therapy."

    "abstract": "A 27-year-old woman with well-documented neurofibromatosis 2 developed a soft, painless, nodular lesion on the skin surface of the left upper eyelid over 2 years. Following excision, histopathology revealed a plexiform neurofibroma with intradermal nodules comprised of benign round and spindle cells that reacted diffusely with immunohistochemical stains SOX-10 and S100. A subset showed focal reactivity for neurofilament and CD34. A perineurium surrounded each nodule with cells staining positively for markers EMA (epithelial membrane antigen) and GLUT1 (glucose transporter 1). Plexiform neurofibromas are rare tumors that occur in 5%-15% of patients with neurofibromatosis 1. Cutaneous abnormalities in neurofibromatosis 2 have not been widely studied although reports have described schwannomas, plexiform schwannomas, and occasional neurofibromas. Plexiform neurofibromas in neurofibromatosis 2 have rarely been illustrated and the current case represents a unique bona fide eyelid example to date."

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant disorder that affects the skin and the nervous system. The condition is completely penetrant with extreme clinical variability, resulting in unpredictable manifestations in affected offspring, complicating reproductive decision-making. One of the reproductive options to prevent the birth of affected offspring is preimplantation genetic testing (PGT). We performed a retrospective review of the medical files of all couples (n = 140) referred to the Dutch PGT expert center with the indication NF1 between January 1997 and January 2020. Of the couples considering PGT, 43 opted out and 15 were not eligible because of failure to identify the underlying genetic defect or unmet criteria for in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment. The remaining 82 couples proceeded with PGT. Fertility assessment prior to IVF treatment showed a higher percentage of male infertility in males affected with NF1 compared to the partners of affected females. Cardiac evaluations in women with NF1 showed no contraindications for IVF treatment or pregnancy. For 67 couples, 143 PGT cycles were performed. Complications of IVF treatment were not more prevalent in affected females compared to partners of affected males. The transfer of 174 (out of 295) unaffected embryos led to 42 ongoing pregnancies with a pregnancy rate of 24.1% per embryo transfer. There are no documented cases of misdiagnosis following PGT in this cohort. With these results, we aim to provide an overview of PGT for NF1 with regard to success rate and safety, to optimize reproductive counseling and PGT treatment for NF1 patients."

    "title": "Clinical and imaging modality factors impacting radiological interpretation of breast screening in young women with neurofibromatosis type 1.",
    "abstract": "Young women with Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) have a high risk of developing breast cancer and poorer survival following breast cancer diagnosis. International guidelines recommend commencing breast screening between 30 and 35 years; however, the optimal screening modality is unestablished, and previous reports suggest that breast imaging may be complicated by the presence of intramammary and cutaneous neurofibromas (cNFs). The aim of this study was to explore potential barriers to implementation of breast screening for young women with NF1.Twenty-seven women (30-47 years) with NF1 completed breast screening with breast MRI, mammogram and breast ultrasound. Nineteen probably benign/suspicious lesions were detected across 14 women. Despite the presence of breast cNFs, initial biopsy rate for participants with NF1 (37%), were comparable to a BRCA pathogenic variant (PV) cohort (25%) (P = 0.311). No cancers or intramammary neurofibromas were identified. Most participants (89%) returned for second round screening.The presence of cNF did not affect clinician confidence in 3D mammogram interpretation, although increasing breast density, frequently seen in young women, impeded confidence for 2D and 3D mammogram. Moderate or marked background parenchymal enhancement on MRI was higher in the NF1 cohort (70.4%) than BRCA PV carriers (47.3%), which is an independent risk factor for breast cancer.Breast MRI was the preferred mode of screening over mammogram, as the majority (85%) with NF1 demonstrated breast density (BI-RADS 3C/4D), which hinders mammogram interpretation. For those with high breast density and high cNF breast coverage, 3D rather than 2D mammogram is preferred, if MRI is unavailable."

    "abstract": "Crouzon Syndrome is a genetic craniosynostosis disorder associated with a high risk of ophthalmologic sequelae secondary to structural causes. However, ophthalmologic disorders due to intrinsic nerve aberrations in Crouzon Syndrome have not been described. Optic pathway gliomas (OPGs) are low grade gliomas that are intrinsic to the visual pathway, frequently associated with Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1). OPGs involving both optic nerves without affecting the optic chiasm are rarely seen outside of NF-1. We report an unusual case of bilateral optic nerve glioma without chiasmatic involvement in a 17-month-old male patient with Crouzon Syndrome without any clinical or genetic findings of NF-1. This case suggests that close ophthalmologic follow up and orbital MRIs may benefit patients with Crouzon Syndrome."

    "abstract": "Cutaneous neurofibromas (cNFs) are a hallmark of patients with the neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) genetic disorder. These benign nerve sheath tumors, which can amount to thousands, develop from puberty onward, often cause pain and are considered by patients to be the primary burden of the disease. Mutations of NF1, encoding a negative regulator of the RAS signaling pathway, in the Schwann cell (SCs) lineage are considered to be at the origin of cNFs. The mechanisms governing cNFs development are poorly understood, and therapeutics to reduce cNFs are missing, mainly due to the lack of appropriate animal models. To address this, we designed the Nf1-KO mouse model that develops cNFs. Using this model, we found that cNFs development is a singular event and goes through 3 successive stages: initiation, progression, and stabilization characterized by changes in the proliferative and MAPK activities of tumor SCs. We found that skin trauma accelerated the development of cNFs and further used this model to explore the efficacy of the MEK inhibitor binimetinib to cure these tumors. We showed that while topically delivered binimetinib has a selective and minor effect on mature cNFs, the same drug prevents their development over long periods."
